THE Director of Military Intelligence informed the WarCabinet that an advance of 400 yards had been made at Villeret,south-west of Le Catelet, and that, while it was not a part of anyextensive operation, it was an improvement of the position.The Russian 2. The Director of Military  Intelligence stated  that  theFront. German advance had stopped for the moment, but whether it was for the purpose of getting up guns or for any other reason no information was at present available.
3. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that it was doubtful as to what was happening in Petrograd, where there were approximately 100,000 troops, of whom about 20,000 had beensent into the surrounding districts on defensive lines against*any advance by General Korniloff. He added that these were re-formed regiments, and that their fighting value was not of a highorder. General Macdonogh stated that all the superior military officers in the Russian Army were apparently againstM. Kerensky.Lord Robert Cecil stated that no telegrams had lately beenreceived from Russia; it was therefore doubtful if we were inpossession of the facts of the matter in all its aspects, and that thelast telegram that had been received from Sir George Buchananwas dated the 10th instant.The view was expressed that General Korniloff representedall that was sound and hopeful with regard to an improvement inthe situation in Russia, and that he should not be condemned ontelegrams received from Russian sources, as the case as now presented was one-sided, prejudiced, and possibly untrue. Itwas really a duel between M. Kerensky and General Korniloff,and it was possible that the latter had jeopardised the success ofhis movement by premature action, after failing to obtain thesupport, which he deemed essential to the welfare of Russia, fromM. Kerensky. To talk of General Korniloff as a &quot; traitor to his country &quot; was monstrous, and it should not be forgotten that inthe past we have been in general sympathy with his endeavours to aid the cause not only of Russia but of the Allies. It was feltthat, difficult though it was for the British Government to interfere in the present situation without appearing to take sides withGeneral Korniloff, it was impossible, in the interests of the Alliesand of democracy generally, to make no effort to improve thesituation, though it was realised that any steps.in that directionwould have to be taken through M. Kerensky, as he was therepresentative of the existing Government. It was suggested thatlie should be informed that the British Government viewed withthe greatest alarm the probabilities of civil war, and urged to come to terms with General Korniloff, not only in the interestof Russia herself, but in that of the Allies.It was pointed out, with reference to War Cabinet 229,Minute 13, that Sir George Buchanan was aware of the desire ofthe Government to support the previous programme of GeneralKorniloff, and the War Cabinet decided that&apos; The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct Sir George Buchanan to use his discretion inaddressing an appeal to M. Kerensky, being guided bythe situation on the spot and the circumstances within his knowledge as to the form of the appeal and the occasionat which it should be presented.The War Cabinet further requested The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to informthe French Government of our action in this matter, andto urge them to issue similar instructions to their Ambas--   ambassador in Petrograd.4. With reference to War Cabinet 230, Minute 8, the Directorof. Military Intelligence informed the War Cabinet that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff wished the War Cabinet to know that he had not taken steps to ascertain, through General Barter,General Korniloffs views as to assistance by Japanese troops, as
3YiC 231the existing trouble in Russia arose before such action could wellbe taken.The War Cabinet approved this course.East Africa. 5. The Director of Military Intelligence informed the WarCabinet that both the Belgian column and our troops were advance-. ing on Mahenge, from which place both forces were distant aboutthirty miles. He added that apparently the situation in EastAfrica was progressing satisfactorily, and that a smaller zonewas in occupation by the enemy than had been the case threemonths ago.Naval Prizes. 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that two Dutch prizes had been brought into Harwich with contrabandon board.Air Offensive.Serbia.Man-Power andRecruiting.7. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the Royal naval air Service had carried out bombing raids upon Bruges Docks and at . Denis Westrem, and that all our machines had returned safely.Sir Rosslyn Wemyss added that in an enemy raid on Dunkirk onthe night of September 10-11 no material damage had been effected.8. With reference to War Cabinet 230, Minute 13, the deputy first Sea Lord stated that Rear-Admiral Troubridge had beenappointed to the Personal Staff of the Prince Regent, and in no way represented the Admiralty. It was mentioned that GeneralCorkran had been selected by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff for special duty at Serbian Headquarters, and that sir william Robertson was very anxious that General Corkranshould be in no way under Rear-Admiral Troubridge.The War Cabinet decided that The question of recalling Rear-Admiral Troubridge shouldnot be brought up until General Corkran had taken overhis duties and was able to report if any difficulty arose inthe conduct of the same owing to the presence of AdmiralTroubridge.9. The War Cabinet confirmed the decisions of Lord Milner5sCommittee on Man-Power and Recruiting, as set out in Appen-dix I, and sanctioned an additional paragraph 8 to that sectionlaying down the functions of the Ministry of National Service, thesaid paragraph to read as follows :- The above statement of functions is not intended to over-ridein any way any agreement that has been or may be made between the Ministry of National Service and any other government Department.Coal for Italy. 10. With reference to War Cabinet 198, Minute 13, lord robert Cecil drew the attention of the War Cabinet to recent telegrams and despatches from our Ambassador at Rome, whichset out that, in the opinion of Baron Sonnino, the coal difficulties were of an acute nature; that the deficit in July was 47 per cent.,and for the first four weeks of August 52 per cent., and that, sofar from improving, the state of affairs was worse than it was.He fully realised that the Shipping Controller had great difficulties, and it was really a question for the Cabinet to decide
whether a reduction should not be made in our imports, or ship-ping obtained by other means, so that by making such sacrificesthe coal situation, and consequently the munition supply, *in italy might be improved. He added that Baron Sonnino was of opinionthat if he could tide over the next two months he would be able toget through the winter. He stated that the demands for coal hadbeen closely examined, and were looked upon as the minimum requirements, and that we must assume the figures given to us bythe Italian Government to be accurate until the contrary wasproved.Sir E. Wyldbore Smith pointed out that the question of sending coal from .S.E. France by rail to Italy was now being discussed by the railway experts of the two countries.The Shipping Controller stated that under existing conditions we were doing better than he had expected, but that considerabledelays had taken place in the turning round of ships; that ships had been held up at Gibraltar owing to lack of convoys for their protection; and that the Admiralty had stated that, as far as theywere concerned, they were unable to provide further protection.Sir Joseph Maclay reported that at the close of the Archangelseason a certain amount of Russian tonnage would be available for italy. He stated that more tonnage could be allocated for Italiancoal if the War Cabinet were prepared to take the risk of usingliners for this purpose and sending them unescorted.Sir Rosslyn Wemyss stated that the Italians had shown no desire to supply the necessary ships for convoy purposes, and thatit was very difficult to obtain from the Italian Government anydata as to their patrol and convoy organisation, or assistance insuch matters.The War Cabinet asked Lord Milner to re-assemble his Committee, to go into andreport to the War Cabinet upon the question of increas-ing the supply of coal to Italy, and to enquire closely into(a.) the accuracy of the figures in support of the demands for coal; (Jb.) the question of convoys for the ships to convey the same; (c.) our own shortage of supplies andthe question as to whether in any respects they shouldbe temporarily further&apos; reduced, so as to relieve thesituation in italy .Horses and Mulesfor Greece.11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memoran-dum by the Secretary of State for War, forwarding a Minute bythe Quartermaster-General (Paper G.T.-1950), as to the supply of horses and mules for Greece (Appendix II).The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War and the Shipping Controllershould confer as to the possibility of providing the requisite tonnage, and such purchase in America of horses and mules as could be carried in the ships that were found to be available.AllegedDisaffectionamongst BritishTroops at Home.12. Attention was called to a letter received by Lord Curzonfrom the Bishop of Oxford (Paper G.T.-1979), relative to the grave discontent which existed amongst the troops &quot;stationed atthe Command &apos; Depot at Shoreham, the grounds of objection,being stated to be insufficiency of food and refusal of leave owingto the absence of sufficient railway accommodation.Major-General Hutchison stated that similar reports hadbeen received before the letter from the Bishop of Oxford had beenbrought to his notice. The grievance as to leave (a) was primarilydue to the restrictions in the use of trains running to Brighton,
an Order having been issued by the Army Council, as the resultof a War Committee decision on the 29th November, 1916, thattrain travelling was prohibited and that men going on leave fromShoreham must travel by motor-buses. These, owing to the petrolshortage, had since ceased to run. Another grievance was thequestion of pay (b), the low rate of which caused irritation to ourmen, owing to the fact that Canadian troops, with their high ratesof pay, were quartered in their&apos; vicinity. A further grievancewas the food question (c), for which he thought there was nofoundation, as the men had practically the same food ration as ifthey were camped in France. He stated that the men stationed at Shoreham were sent there to harden up for further service,after being wounded or sick, and that their daily work was pro-gressive until they had been rendered fit for service once more.As regards (a) the War Cabinet requested The Army Council to make the necessary arrangements toprovide accommodation for the troops going on leave inthe trains running between Shoreham and Brighton, and vice versa.With regard to (b) the War Cabinet requested The Military Authorities to go into the matter of re-groupingthe Convalescent Camps so that Dominion soldiers werenot quartered in the   same   Command   Depots  with british soldiers.As regards the actual rate of pay of the latter, theWar Cabinet directed the Secretary to put on the Agendaat an early date the Report of Sir Edward Carson&apos;sCommittee on Increased Rates of Pay for Soldiers.As regards (c), complaints with regard to food, the WarCabinet were unable to concur with the view expressed by theMilitary Authorities, that the food ration was adequate, having in view that the men were convalescent, and the suggestion thatthe dietary was not equal to that consumed by the average workingman in England.   They therefore directed The War Office to enquire into the food supply not only atShoreham, but at all Command Depots, and to furnish areport on the subject as soon as possible.Brigadier-General Childs was of opinion that though therewas a certain amount of discontent in certain units it was notin any way general. That the conditions which had been dis-cussed contributed towards discontent, but that the real greatcause amongst men at Command Depots was that they were beinghardened&quot; up for service again at the front having perhaps beenwounded two or three times, whilst there were thousands of fit men in the United Kingdom in protected industries earning very high wages who had never been called up for military service. he knew that Lord Derby and the Adjutant-General had been latelygiving serious consideration to the problem of the woundedsoldier, and he thought that he heard the word &quot; discharge&apos;&apos;mentioned. He added that absence was a somewhat commonoffence at Command Depots, but that as regards desertion therehad been no increase in the percentage. He mentioned that theefforts to create a Workman&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council in thiscountry had been a complete failure so far as the Army was con-cerned.13. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumon Admiralty Organisation (Paper  G.T.-2003), and approved the proposals contained therein,mi C
The First Lord explained that with reference to the last four paragraphs of Section 17 of his Memorandum, and withreference to Section 18, he had been asked by the Board to givethe Operations and Maintenance Committees of the Boq,rd thepower to place matters on the Board Agenda, thereby forgoingthe historic custom under which the First Lord only decided whether a matter was to go on the Board Agenda or not. TheFirst Lord explained that, in his view, having regard to the collective responsibility of the Board in matters of importance, itwas not unreasonable that a group of members of the Board, suchas those forming one or other of the two Committees of the Board,should have the right to secure for the Board as a whole theopportunity of recording their opinion on matters of importance,and he proposed by internal regulation to provide for this. as this involved a matter of principle, however, he wished to obtainthe authority of the Cabinet before doing so.The War Cabinet further approved this proposal.2.

Thomas, when he was over here the other day, spoke to me on the subjectof horses for Greece. I have been into the question with the Quartermaster-General, and for the information of the War Cabinet I circulate a memorandum which he has given me which shows our position as regards horses.It will be noticed that the French in their allotment have laid down that weshould supply the heavy draught horses to the extent of 5,450. This is the class of horse which, at the present moment, it is almost impossible to obtain in this country without interfering with essential work, such as dock work, &amp;c. It therefore atonce becomes a question of shipment, but even then, as will be noticed from the quartermaster-GeneraFs report, it will take us some months to purchase. As,however, the guns will not be forthcoming for some time, probably we could getthe horses by the time they have got the guns available.I should like the Cabinet&apos;s instructions as to whether we should give the 450suggested by the Quartermaster-General and start the purchase of the remaining5,000, the necessary shipping being found by the Shipping Controller.DERBY.September 5, 1917.
Minute by the Quartermaster-General.With regard to the French demands for horses, &amp;c, for Greece, i.e.1,500 Riding Horses to be found by the French.3,500 Light Draught Horses to be found by the French.1,950 Mules to be found by the French.5,450 Heavy Draught Horses to be found by the British.1,950 Mules to be found by the British.All with the necessary harness.In England we have only barely sufficient to -keep the units in France in theField. It is one of our greatest difficulties procuring the right stamp of heavydraught horse, as the purchase is increasingly difficult in Great Britain. Wehave also Egypt and Salonika to supply, and have only about 4,500 in England tokeep up 72,000 in France, whilst the Salonika wastage is about 100 a month, and egypt about 200 a month.In Salonika the establishment of heavy draught horses is 1,592, and there are actually there, 1,427; if the heavy batteries now due for Egypt go from Salonikawithout horses there are no horses for them in Egypt, and they would be useless.In Egypt we are below establishment owing to shipping difficulties, but can justkeep going, and will now draw on France and America as arranged with general smuts, for which we have shipping.I do not quite understand whether they mean really heavy draught horses, as ,450 is a very heavy demand for this class. We might give now 450, but our4,500 here means only about two months&apos; reserve in hand, and it is the chief demand at the moment from France. All I can suggest is that the 5,000 balance shouldbe imported from North America (if we can, now the Americans are coming intothe field).   This means shipping (5 or 6 ships), plus upkeep, say 300 a month.
