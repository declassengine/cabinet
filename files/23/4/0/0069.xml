IN reference to War Cabinet 294, Minute 4, the WarExtension of Cabinet had before them a note prepared by the Chief of theBritish Line. Imperial General Staff regarding the extension of the front held bythe British forces in France, covering certain correspondence from field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on the subject (Paper G.T.-2884).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained that he had raised the question because no definite reply had been given on thissubject to M. Clemenceau, who referred to it at the recent paris conference.Lord Milner explained that when in Paris he had seenM. Clemenceau, who, while agreeing that the present was not the[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1917.
moment for pressing for an extension of the front held by theBritish in view of what had happened at Cambrai, had stateddefinitely that the question was one which would have to be settled in the near future, and that lie would again bring it forward for settlement.The War Cabinet decided that  No action should be taken in regard to this matter for themoment.The General 2. In regard to the Western front as a whole, the PrimeSituation. Minister said that the situation as regards man-power was most pressing. He had recently been furnished with figures by theDirector of Military Intelligence which showed that on the western front the French and British together had 1,200,000 more men inthe field than the Germans, and 400,000 more rifles than theGermans. This applied to the situation alter five British and sixFrench divisions had been despatched to Italy. Even if theGermans were to transfer all their serviceable divisions from theEastern front to the West, which amounted to some thirty-two divisions out of seventy-nine, or an approximate total of 300,000rifles, they would still be in a minority on the Western front. Inthese circumstances the Prime Minister was unable to understand the rather alarmist tone as to the situation which had recently beenexhibited. He pointed out that the public were considerably dis-disturbed over this matter, quite unnecessarily, as be thought, havingregard to the actual facts, and it was highly desirable that theyshould receive some official reassurance.Transfer of german divisions.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGermans had transferred from the Eastern to the Western fronttwo more divisions, which had been sent to Cambrai and Rheimsrespectively. This brought the total transfer of strength from east to West in six weeks to eight divisions, or four on balance. two more German divisions had been moved from Flanders to Cambrai,making a total of eight transferred from Flanders. In all, theGermans had, since the 20th November, 1917&apos;, the date of the com-mencement of the British attack near Cambrai, transferred to that area nineteen divisions.The Invasion ofItaly.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that two divisions of French troops were now in the front line.Mesopotamia. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staft read extracts froma telegram received from Mesopotamia, which showed that theTurkish forces in that quarter were extremely short of food, theirweekly death-roll amounting to \ per cent.   (Telegram X, 5189.)The Chief of the Imperial General Staff&quot; read extracts from atelegram (T.W. 67) received from Mesopotamia to the effect thatthe&apos; Russian commander on the Caucasus front had put forward proposals for an armistice with the enemy.Palestine:Surrender of jerusalem, i6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatJerusalem had been isolated and the town surrendered by its Mayorto the British Commander-in-chief, who had stated that the formalentry would not take place until the 11th December.
Submarines.8. The First Sea Lord reported, that (a.) On the 7th instant a British airship bombed an enemy submarine in the Irish Channel, but the latter was probably only damaged :(6.) On the 8th instant, near Hartland Point, an airship hadbombed another submarine, with a similar result;(c.) On tbe 8th instant the airship &quot; C. 5 &quot; had dropped bombs on a submarine some 70 miles from the Smalls, withunknown result;(cl.) On the 8th instant the airship &quot; C. 9 &quot; had dropped a bombnear a submarine, some 60 miles south-west of the ScillyIsles, with unknown result;(e.) On the 9th instant a seaplane had dropped bombs on a submarine some 20 miles south of the Start, with resultsthat were promising ;(/.) On the 9 th instant the trawler &quot; Benlawers &quot; reported havingrammed and sunk a submarine 41 miles from the Lizard.Activity in theEnglish Channel.9. The First Sea Lord reported great enemy submarine activity in the English Channel, and estimated that nearly all the german submarines were passing out to the open sea that way. He con-sidered that there were at least six large and several smallsubmarines at present operating in the Channel.Explosion atHalifax, NovaScotia.10. In reference to War Cabinet 294, Minute 18, the first sea Lord reported that the casualties caused hy the explosion atHalifax were estimated at over 1,000 killed and 5,000 injured.   SixThe War Cabinet, after consideration of the question of thepublication of this information, in the light of previous discussions(War Cabinet 280, Minute 5), deckled that The news should be given out as briefly as possible in theHouse of Commons that afternoon.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to produce a communique before the afternoon&apos;s meeting for the purpose of publication.Greece: 7. The Secretary of State for War reported that a large stockSupplies for. of supplies, which it had been decided should be sent to Greece,had been collected and were ready for shipment. He explainedthat the procedure was that the Commission intexmationale deBavitaillement gave orders for supplies to the War Office, and thatthat body was responsible for obtaining sanction from the treasury and making the necessary arrangements with tbe ShippingController. In this case, though the goods were all ready for despatch, the Commission internationale de Ttavitaillement had not got the necessary Treasury sanction.It was pointed out that the representative of the Treasury atthe Conference in Paris had agreed to this course.Lord Derby further explained that the question of priority was involved, since the supplies necessary for Salonica and for Egyptwere in arrears to the extent of some 30,000 tons. He requested adecision of the War Cabinet as to whether supplies for Salonica and egypt or for Greece should have priority.The Secretary of State for War undertook to take the matter upthrough the Commission internationale de Piavitaillementwith a view to their approaching the Treasury as regardsfinance, and also the Shipping Controller.
merchant ships had been severely damaged, and several others more orless damaged, one tug being completely wrecked. In the Dockyardthe destruction has been very great. The situation was in hand, andconvoy work could be continued.Bombing Raid.1J. The First Sea Lord reported a bombing raid on theAertrycke Aerodrome on the 8th instant, a total of twenty-eightbombs having been dropped with apparent success. The bombers were attacked by enemy scouts, two of which were driven down and appeared to be damaged. All our pilots and machines returned safely.Archangel.12. In reference to War Cabinet 29?,, Minute 9, the First sea lord drew attention to the fact that no decision had yet beenreached in regard to our action at Archangel.Man-Power:American Units.13. It was suggested that one way of solving the man-powerproblem, would be for the drafts of American troops, as they reached Frauce, to be incorporated as drafts in our forces, since,though the transport of completely equipped divisions from theUnited States presented great difficulties, owing to lack of tonnage,the transport of men could probably be effected. By this means the shortage in the Allies&apos; man-power could be made good.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained, in referenceto War Cabinet 292, Minute 3, that, although the matter ofincorporating American troops with British units had been putforward to Colonel House in Paris, the idea had been to incorporateeither entire companies in British battalions, or entire battalions inBritish brigades, and it could hardly be expected that the UnitedStates Government would agree to their men being used as drafts.Colonel House had stated that he would refer the matter to general pershing, and then to the President of the United States on his return.American Shipping.14. The Prime Minister drew attention to the serious report inregard to the American shipping construction situation, which hadbeen received from Sir Thomas Royden, to the effect that, insteadof constructing 6,000,000 tons, as had been promised, the UnitedStates Government were only undertaking the construction of2,000,000 tons.In this connection Mr. Balfour stated that, when in Paris, hehad, at Lord Reading&apos;s request, asked the United States repre-sentatives that their Government might undertake the constructionof 9,000,000 tons instead of the 6,000,000 tons promised.Russia: 15. The War Cabinet considered their general policy in regardGeneral Policy. . to Russia, and in this connection had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper G.T.-2932),dated 9th December, 1917 (Appendix).It was suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government was not primarily or specially concerned with the composition of the RussianGovernment, or with the local aspirations of the Bolsheviks or other political parties, except in so far as they bore on their attitude toour conflict with the Central Powers. This was the line we hadtaken during the Czar&apos;s reign, and there was no reason to departfrom it. Our dominant purpose throughout the revolution shouldbe :-(a.) If possible, to keep Russia in the war until our joint war aims were realised ; or
(6.) If this could not be secured, then to ensure that Russia was as helpful to us and as harmful to the enemy as possible.For this purpose we should seek to influence Russia togive to any terms of peace that might be concluded withthe enemy a bias in our favour.It was difficult to foretell how strong the Bolsheviks might become, or how long their power might endure; but if, as seemed likely, they maintained an ascendancy for the next few months only,these months were critical, and to antagonise them needlessly wouldbe to throw them into the arms of Germany. There were at themoment signs that within a few days, when the elections for theConstituent Assembly had been completed, the Bolsheviks wouldbe installed in power not only in a de facto, but also in a con-stitutional sense.In this connection reference was made to recent messages whichhad been received from the British Embassy at Petrograd. In atelegram dated the 8th December, 1917 (Foreign Office No. 1984),the terms were given of a six months&apos; armistice proposed by theBolsheviks, and it was stated that there was a remarkable change inthe official press, the Allies not being attacked, for the first time forseveral weeks.In the &quot; Times&quot; of that day there appeared a report that theGermans were making the following conditions : (a.) Germany to obtain, for fifteen years, a control of the Russianwheat market.(&amp;-.) Importation into Russia of all German goods duty free,(c.) No   territory   uow   occupied   by German  troops  to be surrendered.Attention was also drawn to a telegram to the Chief of theImperial General Staff, dated the 5th December, 1917 (No. 1404),recounting a private and unofficial interview with Krikenko, theBolshevik Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, during whichhe said that be had issued an order that all armistice agreements should contain a clause forbidding transfer of troops from one frontto another. He appeared most anxious to make a favourable im-pression on Allied officers, and had carried out ail suggestions madeto him for safeguarding the lives of officers and their families. Ina telegram dated the 6th December, 1917 (Foreign Office No. 1971),Sir George Buchanan reported an interview between Captain Smithand Trotzki, at which the prohibition of British subjects leavingRussia was discussed in connection with the detention in thiscountry of Messrs. Tritchirine and Petroff. Trotzki denied that theprohibition was intended as a threat. His object had been toemphasise the difference between the treatment accorded to Russiansubjects in the United Kingdom and British subjects in Russia.On publication in the local press of a communique to the effect thatthe British Government would reconsider the cases of all Russiansubjects interned in Great Britain and would give facilities for returnto their country of all Russians innocent of any offence punishableby the laws of Great Britain, he (Trotzki) would the same dayrestore full liberty of movement to all British subjects in Russia.Sir George Buchanan urged His Majesty&apos;s Government to agree toaccept the compromise proposed by Trotzki, otherwise he feared that British subjects would be held up indefinitely.The War Cabinet were impressed with the fact that, by continuing to intern Tritchirine and Petroff the lives of thousands ofBritish subjects were being endangered, and that the case for theirinternment (was not a very strong one. On the other hand, theclangers of any traffic with the Bolsheviks were very real. Thestrength of the Bolshevik Government lay in the fact that itsupported peace, and that if it abandoned its efforts for peace it[1365-295] C
would probably be overthrown. Further, to take any action on thelines suggested above action for which the Bolshevik Governmenthad pressed could hardly be regarded as consistent with the support which was being proffered to General Kaledin in the South. was it desirable to treat with both Trotzki and Kaledin at one and thesame time ? Our policy towards Kaledin had been decided upon.Would it not be wise to wait and see whether the Bolshevik Govern-ment was going to last ?To this it was replied that our assistance to Kaledin was directed against the Germans and not against the Bolsheviks, andwas specially intended to help the Roumanians.The War Cabinet, without making any change in their recentpolicy towards Russia, authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform Sir GeorgeBuchanan that the policy jiroposed in his telegram No. 1971was accepted.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also undertook todeal with Tritchirine and Petroff in the best way he could,in consultation with Sir George Buchanan and the HomeSecretary, and to deal with three other Russians who were reported as having been interned here.16. With reference to War Cabinet 294, Minute 11, the WarCabinet took note of an interview granted by Sir George Buchananto representatives of the Russian press, in which he protested against the attacks now being made on this country, and declaredthat there was no truth in reports that we were contemplating anycoercive or punitive measures in the event of the Russians makinga separate peace.Rouruania. 17. The Secretary of State for Foreign  Affairs   raised thequestion of our policy towards Roumania, and in this connection the War Cabinet had before them Foreign Office telegrams nos. 1344 and 1347 from Paris, Nos. 737 and 741 from Jassy, anda telegram dated the 7th December, 1917, from the RussianMinister in Teheran to the Russian Embassy in London. Mr. Balfourpointed out that we had so far been trying to keep the Roumanianarmy in active hostility to the enemy, but they had been forced tojoin the armistice with the Russians. They&apos;had as yet made notreaty, but they may have to follow if and when the Bolsheviksconclude a treaty. The War Cabinet had to decide what guidancethey should offer Roumania.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained that theRoumanian army was helpless. It could not be withdrawn any considerable distance into Russia because of defective transport and supply arrangements. So far no answer has been received fromGeneral Kaledin. There had appeared that clay in the press a bolshevik proclamation declaring war against Kaledin and theCossacks.A letter from Captain Noel, dated the 25th November, 1917(Foreign Office telegram No. 1970), was quoted, in which the DonCossacks were said to be weary of the war and unlikely to embark on a new campaign. The Don party might be useful in preventingsupplies from the Caucasus falling into the hands of the Germans if&apos; the Germans get control in Western Russia.It was further shown that, according to the message fromTeheran, and from other sources, there was a strong tendency for southern Russia in particular to dissolve into more or less independentpolitical entities pending the establishment of a Central Governmentuniversally recognised. This was the case in Transcaucasia, the regions of Don, Tersk, and Kouban, the Ukrainian Rada, and possibly the Black Sea littoral.   It was also the case with Finland.Press interview with Sir GeorgeBuchanan.
Eussia&apos;s Entry 18. The War Cabinet decided that into the &quot;War and ; . .     ,, . . ,    -Propaganda. *-he foreign Urhce should prepare, for the use of the Departmentof Information, a statement of tbe reasons for which russia was drawn into the war, which might be used aspropaganda.Supplies to Eussia 19. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (paper and Eoumania. G.T.-2905),  submitted   by Lord Milners Committee on RussianSupplies, regarding the interpretation to be given to the decisions ofWar Cabinet 288, Minutes 9 to 12.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Reference Minute 9 (c). No further orders involving a freshcredit being sanctioned by the Treasury for equipment ofa non-warlike nature should be put forward b3r the Corn-mission internationale de Ravitaillement for the present,but that this stoppage of further orders should be carriedout as quietly as possible, and without publication.(6.) The single ship now being loaded for Murmansk containingsupplies for Roumania should go forward, and that everyeffort should be used to get these supplies through to roumania (subject to (/) below).(c.) A decision regarding the possible liquidation of the contractin America for Russian rifles, for which the british treasury is responsible, should be postponed for ten days,and should then again be brought up for consideration.id.) None of the locomotives and waggons now en route fromVancouver to Vladivostock should be delivered in Russia,and that the disposal of this material should lie left tothe Milner Committee, acting in consiiltation with thevarious Departments concerned.(e.) The principle to be observed in dealing with the ships nowat or due to arrive at Murmansk was that every effort should be made to prevent the services of the ships beinglost. With this object in view, it might even be neces-sary to discharge the ships of all their cargoes, includingwarlike stores, or to order the ships to return to Englandwithout discharging anything. If possible, however&apos;,the ships should discharge their non-warlike stores and return to England with their cargoes of warlike stores.The Admiralty authorities should communicate thisdecision to their representatives at Murmansk with a[1365-295] the War Cabinet recognised that, in certain eventualities,it might be the greatest kindness to Roumania, and least embarrassing to us, to release Roumania entirely from her agreement with theAllies.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should supplyinformation as to the population and general condition ofthose portions of Russia which showed a disposition notto accept Bolshevik rule;(6.) The General Staff, the Admiralty, and the Ministry of blockade should record their views as to the conditionswhich the British Ambassador at Petrograd should be instructed to press for, if circumstances enabled him todo so, in any terms of peace made between the Bolsheviksand Germany.
view to their co-operating in giving effect to thisdecision.(/.) The boots, clothing, &amp;c, which had been ordered forFtoumania at the instance of the American Governmentshould not now be despatched, and the portion whichhad been loaded into the ship referred to at (6) above should be unloaded.Subject to the above rulings, Lord Milner, or, in his absence,Sir L. Worthington Evans, was empowered to decide questions of detail which might arise within the terms of War Cabinet 288,Minutes 9-12.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,December 10, 1917.
APPENDIX.G.T.-2932. -Notes on the Present Russian Situation.AS T may not be able to be present at Cabinet to-morrow, I desire to make thesenotes.The following points have to be specially kept in view: 1. The safety of our Embassy in Petrograd and of British subjects in Russia.2. The interests of Roumania and her ariny.3. The best course to adopt in order to diminish as much as possible the advantage which Germany will be able to extract from the dissolution of the russian army as a fighting force.These subjects are all interconnected, though so far as possible I will deal withthem separately.1. The greatest danger to Sir George Buchanan and the British colony arisesprobably out of the possibility of&quot; mob-violence, excited by the anti-British propagandafomented by German money in Petrograd and elsewhere. The only real security against this is to be found either by the establishment of a strong and order-lovingGovernment in Russia, or by the removal of the British, official and unofficial, to somesafer country.The first we can do nothing to secure. The second cannot be obtained unless weare able (a) to provide the necessary transport either through Sweden or through somenorthern port of Russia, and (6) to win tire goodwill (in however qualified a form) of thepresent rulers of Petrograd.The question of transport is hardly a Foreign Office matter, but the policy of avoiding the active malevolence of the Bolshevik party raises most important diplomaticissues.It was suggested at Cabinet on Friday that, after their recent proclamations, theBolsheviks could only be regarded as avowed enemies, and to treat them as anything else showed a lamentable incapacity to see facts as they are, and to handle them withdecision.I entirely dissent from this view and believe it to be founded on a misconception.If, for the moment, the Bolsheviks show peculiar virulence in dealing with the BritishEmpire, it is probably because they think that the British Empire is the great obstacle to immediate peace; but they are fanatics to whom the constitution of every State,whether monarchical or republican, is equally odious. Their appeal is to everyrevolutionary force, economic, social, racial, or religious, which can be used to upset theexisting political organisations of mankind. If they summon the Mohammedans of Indiato revolt, they are still more desirous of engineering a revolution in Germany. Theyare dangerous dreamers, whose power, be it great or small, transitory or permanent,depends partly on German gold, partly on the determination of the Russian army tofight no more ; but who would genuinely like to put into practice the wild theorieswhich have so long been germinating in the shadow of the Russian autocracy.Now, contrary to the opinion of some of m3&apos; colleagues, I am clearly of opinion thatit is to our advantage to avoid, as long as possible, an open breach with this crazysystem. If this be drifting, then I am a drifter by deliberate policy. On the broaderreasons for my view, I will say a word directly, but its bearing on the narrower issue ofthe safety of Sir George Buchanan and the British colony is evident. I am personallyof opinion that the Cabinet should reverse the decision it came to some little time ago,and should deport to Russia the two interned Russian subjects in whose fate theRussian rulers appear to be so greatly interested. I was not in England when thedecision to retain them was come to, and I am imperfectly acquainted with the reasonsfor it. Doubtless they were sufficient. But I cer-tainly think that we may now with advantage send these two Russians back to then own country, where, judged by localstandards, their opinions will piobably appear sane and moderate.I have already instructed Sir Geoige Buchanan to abstain completely from any action which can be interpreted as an undue interference with the internal affairs of
the country to which he is accredited, and I am unable to think of any other step which would help to secure his safety.2. As regards the Roumanian army, events have marched rapidly. everything that could be done, even as a forlorn hope, has been done to enable the army to join with other forces in Russia prepared to continue the struggle, but for the moment nosuch forces appear to exist, and the Roumanian army is under the strictest military necessity of acquiescing in the armistice, or rather the cessation of hostilities, on its part of the line.Very difficult and important questions, such as those raised by General Berthelotin a memorandum I have ordered to be circulated, still remain to be decided, but these call for no immediate action. I hope that General Berthelot&apos;s memorandum willbe carefully considered by the Headquarters Staff.&apos;6. I have already indicated my view that we ought if possible not to come to an open breach with the Bolsheviks or drive them into the enemy&apos;s camp. But there arewider reasons for this policy than the safety of the British colony in Russia. Thesewider reasons are as follows: It is certain, I take, it, that, for the remainder of this war, the Bolsheviks are going-to fight neither Germany nor anyone else. But, if we can prevent their aidingGermany we do a great, deal, and to this we should devote our efforts.There are two possible advantages which Germany may extract from Russia&apos;s goingout of the war : (i) She may increase her man-power in other theatres of operation by moving troops from Russian iront. or by getting back German prisoners. Thereis little hope of stopping this, and I say no more about it. (ii) She may obtainthe power of using the large potential resources of Russia to break the AlliedBlockade. I am not sure that this is not tbe more important of the two advantages,and it has so far been very imperfectly examined. As regards oil, we want to know what means of transport there is in the Black Sea available to tbe Germans, and how far the anti-Bolshevik elements in the Caucasian regions can be utilised to-interfere with the supply on land. As regards cereals, the difficulties the germans are likely to have arises mainly, I suppose, from the chaotic condition of thecountry, the disorganisation of all means of transport, and the determination of theRussians to use their own produce for their own purposes.If we drive Russia into the hands of Germany, we shall hasten the organisationof the country by German officials on German lines. Nothing could be more fatal,it seems to me, both to the immediate conduct of the war and to our post-warrelations.Russia, however incapable of fighting, is not easily overrun. Except with the active goodwill of the Russians themselves, German troops (even if there wereGerman troops to spare) are not going to penetrate many hundreds of miles into thatvast country. A mere armistice between Russia and Germany may not for very many months promote in any important fashion the supply of German needs fromRussian sources.. It must be our business to make that period as long as possible by every means in our power, and no policy would be more fatal than to give theRussians a motive for welcoming into their midst German officials and German soldiersas friends and deliverers.A. J. BALFOUR.Foreign Office, December 9, 1917.
