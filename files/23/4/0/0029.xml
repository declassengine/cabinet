The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention to his memorandum (Paper G.T.-2347), covering a telegram in which general Barter had reported that there were some 150,000 Armeniansoldiers in the Russian army, of whom 120,000 were on the eastern front. It was desired that the Russian authorities should be askedto send these troops to the Caucasus, and General Barter had urged that diplomatic pressure should be applied. General Barterhad also reported that the Armenians were anxious to form them-selves into battalions for service in the Caucasus, and had suggestedthat pressure should be put on the Russian Government to facilitatethis development.The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to concert with theUnited States Government in bringing diplomatic pressure to bear on the Russian Government: (a.) To get the Armenian troops now serving on theEastern Front sent to the Caucasus.(6.) To allow of the recruitment and formation ofArmenian units for service on the Caucasus Front.
Eussian VolunteerArmy.8. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretaiy of State for War, covering a Memorandum on the project for a Russian Volunteer Army explained by Professor Pares(Paper G.T.-2337).In his Memorandum Professor Pares gave particulars of a movement in Russia for tbe formation of a Volunteer Army. Themovement arose out of the need for a more conscious discipline inthe Army, as produced by the Revolution, and out of the disruptionof discipline in the existing Army and the consequent disasters.The object of the movement was twofold (a.) To send up new and thoroughly disciplined units to thefront.(b.) To persuade existing units to take the very strict volunteeroaths.A strong semi-official Ail-Russian Central Volunteer Committeehad been formed to conduct work under the supervision of theRussian Commander-in-chief at his Headquarters. The attitude ofthis Committee towards England wTas of the most cordial character,and Professor Pares had been asked to act on it as connecting it with England. Professor Pares submitted that we have everypolitical and military reason for giving the strongest moral and,where possible, material support to this movement. He proposed,inter alia : (a.) That permission shordd be given to the Assistant MilitaryAttaches to act as consultants on volunteer discipline and organisation to the Russian Committee.(b.) The services, if desired and found practicable, of carefully selected British military instructors.(c.) The services of a British expert of volunteer organisation,such, for instance, as Major Harold Baker, M.P.The War Cabinet approved Lord Derby&apos;s action in tellingProfessor Pares that it would be quite impossible for us to volunteer to the Russian Government to do what wassuggested by him, but that if asked for sirck assistanceofficially we would do our best to give it.The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum byMr. Walter Long (Paper G.T.-2365) on the same subject, suggesting that we should telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Petrograd,giving all the story contained in the Memorandum by ProfessorPares, and saying that we could not, of course, put the suggestionforward officially, but that if he could bring the matter informallybefore the Russian Government and secure their support we wrouldmost gladly give our assistance in every way possible.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should discuss thematter with the Russian representatives who are coming to this country en route to the Inter-Ally Conference.Inter-AllyConference.9. The attention of the War Cabinet was called to telegramNo. 2166 from Mr. Balfour to Sir George Buchanan, dated the21st October, 1917, to the effect that it was desirable to explaindiscreetly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, if he brought tothe forthcoming Paris Conference a representative of the DemocraticThe Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to draft thenecessary telegrams on the subject, to be submitted to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.
Congress, the latter would scarcely be able to participate in theproceedings.Mr. Balfour pointed out that he himself had constantly insisted on the importance of substituting informal conversations for formal conferences, and if only his proposals were accepted thedifficulty involved in the attendance of a representative of the democratic Congress would be met.The War Cabinet generally agreed with Mr. Balfour that no onebut a representative of a Government could be present at any formalConference. They recognised, however, that it would be extremelydifficult to refuse to allow the representatives of the Russian Govern-ment to be accompanied, if they desired it, by a representative of the democratic Congress. Even this course, moreover, was open tostrong objection, as any representative of the Congress, if not himself a German agent, would very likely be in touch with personsin collusion with the enemy.In view of the near approach of the forthcoming Paris Con-ference The Prime Minister undertook to confer with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs in regard to this matter andother details in connection with the Conference.Bombardment of 10.

A depth charge was dropped, and the submarine is reported as probably damaged.Riga.12. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet thatthe naval attache, Petrograd, reports that the enemy has recom-menced disembarkation of troops in Dago.

Two250-lb., twelve 112-lb., and six &apos;05-lb. bombs were dropped, and burst on and near the railway.During the afternoon of the 22nd October a bomb raid was attempted on St. Denis Westrem aerodrome, but owing to very thick clouds inland the attempt was given up.
