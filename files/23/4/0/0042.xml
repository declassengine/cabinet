Palestine 1. THE Director of Military Operations explained on the mapthe great sxiccess that had been won by General Allenby incapturing Gaza. On the 5th November his cavalry had made a successful advance to the north of Beersheba, outflanking tiieTurkish left. At midnight on the 6th the 21st Corps had attacked Gaza, captured it, and pushed through to its northern and eastern outskirts. General Allenby had reported considerablecaptures of prisoners, ammunition, stores, and guns, but no exactdetails were yet available. Our aeroplanes reported that the mainbodies of Turks were in retreat, and had gone back 25 miles.Provided that a sufficient water-supply was forthcoming, ourcavalry would be able to pursue the enemy, but our infantry couldnot be expected to go more than 10 miles north of Gaza until therailway extension was constructed. It was, therefore, doubtfulhow far the pursuit could be continued. The new defensiveline to be taken up by the Turks would he that, of Jaffa toJerasalem. The enemy were reported to have made no counter-attacks. Our casualties were reported as 1,400, of whom 112 were killed.The War Cabinet decided that A telegram should be sent to General Allenby, in the name ofthe War Cabinet, congratulating him upon his suecess,when the captures of the enemy had been reported : theDirector of Military Operations to draft such a message,which would be submitted to the Chancellor of theExchequer, and despatched on receipt of details ofcaptures.Mesopotamia. 2. The Director of Military Operations reported that GeneralMaude had telegraphed that on the 2nd November the Turks had advanced southward from Tekrit. Reconnaissance disclosed the factthat two Turkish Divisions (the 51st and 52nd) were isolated andunsupported, and therefore at midnight on the 6th NovemberGeneral Maude attacked them with complete success, carrying allthe Turkish trenches, and took Tekrit. General Maude reportedthat the co-operation of the artillery, cavalry, and flying corps hadbeen excellent. Tekrit is about 90 miles from Bagdad, and GeneralMaude does not intend to stay there, on account of -the exposure tohis flank which would result. What he had done was to push thetwo Turkish Divisions back, and now he would return to Samarrah.The War Cabinet decided that -The substance of this satisfactory information should be givento the press, making it clear that General Maude&apos;s returnto Samarrah was in no way a forced retirement, but part ofhis deliberate pre-arranged plan.The Invasion of 3. The Director of Military Operations reported that the ItalianItaly. rethement was being carried out in rather more satisfactory order and the rear guards were fighting.The War Cabinet discussed the importance of our seizingthe present opportunity to get control of the naval forces in the adriatic. It was suggested that a telegram should be sent to thePrime Minister from the War Cabinet urging him to take advantageof the opportunity to press for the full control the Director of Military Operations suggested that the termsof reference should be made wider than the Adriatic alone,in order that, we might control the route from Marseilles toGenoa, which is at present particularly dangerous and not,under our control.
Submarines. 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that no British ships had been sunk on the previous day, and only one foreign ship.Bombing Raids. 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that he had received information from Dunkirk to the effect that our airmen had droppedbombs on Thourout Railway Station and on a moving train nearLichtervelde. Several direct hits on track and junctions had beenreported.   All our machines had returned safely.Air Offensive. 6. With reference to War Cabinet 262, Minute 10, the question was again raised as to whether the price that we were paying forour raids was not too high. It was pointed out that four Handley-Page machines out of ten had been lost, and it was feared that theimpression still prevails at the Front that the War Cabinet wantraids at any price, regardless of weather.The War Cabinet asked Lord Derby to communicate with General Trenchard, expressing the hope that it was understood that the War Cabinet didnot wish raids to be made in unsuitable weather.Proposed SupremeInter-allied council and allied general Staff.7. With reference to War Cabinet 263, Minute 13 The Secretary of State for War undertook to circulate the terms for the new Supreme Inter-Allied Council, showing all the alterations and amendments that had been made since thefirst proposal, and giving them in the final complete form.American Mission &amp; Mr. Balfour informed the War Cabinet that Colonel House,to England. Mr. Crosby, and experts of all the American Departments had arrived in this country, and that he would be having an interview with Colonel House the same day.Welfare of the 9. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum on theii[ln(i- welfare of the blind, by the President of the Local GovernmentBoard (Paper G.T.-2348), and a memorandum by the Secretary for-Scotland (Paper G.T.-2483), based on the report of the DepartmentalCommittee appointed in May, 1914.Mr. H ayes Iisher  said that the problem of reducing theproportion of the blind to the population was extremely hopeful, if[1365-268] &quot;Fj 2Lord Derby said now that the Taranto route was blocked bymovement of troops to Italy, and therefore was unable to be usedfor Salonica movements, it was imperative that we should get full control of all the sea routes in the Mediterranean.The War Cabinet decided that The Deputy First Sea Lord, after consultation with the FirstLord, should draft a telegram, to be-sent to the PrimeMinister,(a.) Requesting him to press for our full control ofthe naval forces in Italian waters and searoutes for troops ;(b.) Suggesting that Admiral Wemyss, who is familiar with the details of the Mediterranean Command,should proceed to Paris to put the views of theCabinet before the Prime Minister,
suitable measures were taken. Something could be done byimproved administrative action on the part of the Local GovernmentBoard itself, and it might be possible to persuade Industrial councils to induce workmen more often to adopt the wearing of glasses. the elementary education of the blind was very good, but more mipfhtbe done in secondary schools, especially in those for girls. Thecrux of the question, however, was the adequate provision ofworkshops, where the blind who have been trained would be suitablyemployed. At present there are only some 3,000 places, and 3,000more were required. It was true that those workshops could not be built during the war, but it was desirable to lay down a policy now.Additional funds were also needed to provide pensions for the blind who were incapable of earning their living. Thousands ofpensions were being administered by a large number of independentSocieties, with a consequent waste of effort. It was necessary thatthe activities of these Societies should be supervised and co-ordinatedby the Government, and grants-in-aid made to them. For thispurpose, and for carrying out the other recommendations,Mr. Hayes Fisher recommended the setting up of a specialdepartment in the Local Government Board, with an AdvisoryCommittee of persons associated with the care of the blind.Sir Thomas Heath said it would be in accord with recent as wellas older precedents that the whole of the proposed expenditure(500,OOOL capital expenditure and 250,000L annual expenditure)should not fall on the Treasury, but should be met in part by contributions from the Local Authorities concerned. The scheme as outlined was rather far-reaching, and would probably require legislation to give effect to it.Mr. Hayes Fisher thought that it was not unreasonable to look for local contributions towards maintenance and training. Heconfidently believed that there would be a substantial credit side tothe training account, as many of the blind could become, in a great measure, self-supporting. Capital expenditure would, he thought,have to fall on the Treasury, as the workshops would serve ares which would not necessarily coincide with administrative and ratingareas.Mr. Munro said he supported generally the recommendations asset forth by Mr. Hayes Fisher, and they both agreed that thereshould be a separate Advisory Committee for Scotland.The War Cabinet decided to authorise (a.) The setting up of a special department in the LocalGovernment Board and the Local Government board for Scotland to deal with the question, and to sanction the expenditure required for immediate administrativepurposes ;(b.) The establishment of an Advisory Committee for Englandand Wales, and one for Scotland, on the lines proposed,whose first duty would be to advise the Departments onthe preparation of schemes for the consideration of theWar Cabinet.Education Bill. 10. The War Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments : Memoranda bv Mr. H. A. L. Fisher (Papers G.T.-2459 and2370). -A Memorandum by Mr. Barnes (Paper G.T.-2394)...  A Memorandum.by Mr. Munro (Paper G.T.-2448).Mr. Llerbert Fisher said the Bill had secured an amount ofagreement far greater than he had anticipated. There was now no opposition from religious bodies. He had gone through the clauses of the Bill with Cardinal Bourne, and no insuperable difficulties had arisen.   The Local Education authorities disliked one or two of the
administrative clauses, but be thought their apprehensions could beallayed. The friends of half-time were ashamed to come out intothe open to defend the system, and there was thus an opportune moment for emancipating some 30,000 children. He felt very strongly that such widespread unanimity was not likely to recur, andthe Government should seize it to push the Bill through at theearliest possible moment.The War Cabinet recognised that the increasing unanimitywhich was now apparent was due in a special manner to the seriesof striking meetings which the Minister of Education had heldthroughout the country.Mr. Barnes said that organised labour was strongly in favourof pushing on with the Bill, and that a deputation would probablywant to wait on the Prime Minister to say so.Mr. Munro said he desired the authority of the War Cabinetto introduce an Education Bill for Scotland this session under theTen Minutes Rule. Subject to the approval of the Bill, which mr. Munro said would be circulated shortly, the War Cabinet gave the necessary authority.The War Cabinet were in full sympathy with the considerationsurged by Mr. Fisher, and decided to ask the Prime Ministerto make an early announcement that, subject to the exigencies of the war, it was proposed to give precedenceto the Education Bill next session.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 8, 1917.(Initialled) A.
