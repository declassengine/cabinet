1. THE War Cabinet had before them a report by the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff in regard to the situation in Macedonia(Paper G.T.-261.5), dated the 14th November, 1917.The Director of Military Operations said that since the date ofthe report by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff the only materialchanges which had taken place had already been reported to theWar Cabinet. One additional German division had appearedon the Salonica front, where, since the 14th November, therehad arrived altogether nine German battalions and thirteen Bul-garian battalions. With regard to the strength of the allied forces, the report showed that on the 14th November the strengthof the British was down by 7,000 men. Since then we had sentdrafts, and the position now was that, while we were 3,000down as regards infantry, we were 3,000 up in other arms. For all practical purposes it might be said that the British force was upto strength. General Milne&apos;s force was being strengthened by the sending of a few more heavy guns from Egypt, and some aeroplanesof the best type. So far- as the French force was concerned, thegreatest change had been &apos;the change in command. GeneralGuillaumat, who was described as a plain, blunt soldier, had com-manded-at Verdun after General Niveile had become Commander-in-Chief, and was regarded by M. Clemenceau as a first-class man, hadbeen appointed to succeed General Sarrail. The strength of theFrench force had not improved, whereas the English divisions, withan establishment of 1^,000 rifles, to-day mustered 10,500 rifles. TheFrench, on the other hand, with an establishment of 9,000 rifles, onlymustered 5,000. There was no sign of improvement, and general sarrail had lately said he would have to send home on leave 4,000men, for no better reason than that they had been out there foreighteen months. With regard to the Greeks and Serbians, their strength had been increased, the latter by about 4,000 some fromEussia and some from Bizerta. Altogether it appeared that there were160,000 rifles on the Allies&apos; side, as compared with 203,000 rifles onthe enemy&apos;s. General Maurice said that, in his opinion, thissuperiority of about 40,000 rifles would not be sufficient to make an enemy attack on a large scale dangerous, provided that the Allieswere well dug-in and wrell commanded.The questions were asked (a.) Supposing that the enemy did attack, what notice we shouldbe likely to receive ?(b.) What steps we should take \To these the Director of Military Operations replied, withregard to the first question, that it was impossible to guarantee anynotice. The nature of the country behind the enemy&apos;s front made itdifficult to obtain early information, and the only indication of aprobable atta,ck that we could get would be the failure to traceenemy divisions on other points. He added that the present season, was not favourable for operations on a large scale, and that the most favourable time of the year would be from March onwards. Asregards the second question, the only action that we could takemight possibly be to send heavy artillery from Egypt; this w^as theonly reserve available. There whs no army of manoeuvre that couldbe used.The next question put to General Maurice was, In-the eventof a sudden attack by the enemy, what arrangements had been madeto fall back ? General Maurice replied that our own line of retreathad been carefully prepared, but in this as in other matters it hadbeen impossible to find out from General Sarrail what preparationshad been made for the Allied forces as a whole. He understoodthat the question, had been referred to the Supreme War Council at versailles.The War Cabinet requested The Director of Military Operations to telegraph to General
The western front.Cambrai.Daily Messengerand Telephone toVersailles.Wilson to ask what progress he had made in ascertaining the facts of the Salonica situation, as the Cabinet consideredthe matter pressing.2. The Director of Military Operations was asked whether hethought the Germans, in advertising a forthcoming attack on theWestern front, were really planning operations elsewhere. general maurice said that, in his opinion, based on present information, theenemy really did mean to attack on the Western front. Anotherenemy division had arrived in Alsace from Russia, and two more were on the way. During the last two months fifteen divisions, on balance, had been transferred from the Eastern to the Western front(including Italy), and these had not been replaced. In addition,100,000 men had been combed out of&apos; the Eastern front and sent tothe West. The Director of Milicary Operations did not think thatthe enemy would press their attack in Italy, seeing that they hadalready had opportunities of doing so, but had not availed themselves of them, and the season for operations, in the mountains was gettinglate. The balance of evidence appeared to be in favour of theenemy attacking in France and Flanders rather than in Italy, wherethere may be a very heavy fall of snow&apos;at any time. It must beremembered, however, that the Italian army might give up theirground.3. The Director of Military Operations submitted the following statement in regard to guns taken and lost by the British atCambrai between the 20th November and the 10th December,1917 :-- 	Field.	Heavy.	total.Guns lost Guns taken	18-pr.    4&apos;5-in. how. 08             15	60-pr.      6-in. ho-sv. 1               30	144 138	113 98	31 40	4. After some discussion as to improving the means of com-munication between Versailles and London, the War Cabinet decidedthat (a.) The Secretary should make the necessary preparations for sending a messenger daily to Versailles, in order that theSupreme War Council should be supplied with the latest information at the earliest possible moment.(b.) The Secretary should ascertain from the Postmaster-General whether it would be possible to have a privateBritish telephone service established between Londonand Versailles.Palestine.5. The War Cabinet discussed the question whether general allenby should remain where he now is, or exploit the defeat whichhe has inflicted on the Turks.It was pointed out that our Intelligence Service with regard to turkey was very defective and compared unfavourably with our intelligence arrangements on the Western front. For instance, when general Allenby had been asked how many men would be required, inhis opinion, to capture Jerusalem and hold it he had replied that theTurks could bring against him.18 divisions in addition to 2 german divisions that were available. General Allenby had estimated that20 British divisions (500,000 men) would be required to takeJerusalem. What had finally happened was that only 20,000Turkish rifles had opposed our 100,000 rifles.   In addition, the
Turkish transport had completely broken down; there was no coal for the railways, and there were no horses and no mules to enablethe Turks to get their guns away. If, therefore, it were true thatthe Turks were in no position to fight, it would be criminal on our part not to take full advantage of the conditions existing in theTurkish forces.The Director of Military Operations reported that the division which was being moved from Mesopotamia to Egypt might be readywithin six weeks or two months. He said that information nowbeing received from prisoners was to the effect that the establishmentof the Turkish divisions was much lower than we originally thought.In Syria there was no system of Secret Service possible, comparable with that on the Western front, because, owing to the nature ofthe country, we could not get information before it was too stale tobe of use.The War Cabinet were strongly of opinion that it would be well to get General Allenbys views as to the question of exploiting his recent victory.After some discussion the War Cabinet requested The. Secretary of State for War to telegraph to General Allenbyin the following sense : &quot; In view of the change in position created by your recent victory over Turks, and by revisedinformation as to enemy strength and breakdown in histransport, War Cabinet would like to have your opinion by telegram as soon as possible as to manner in which,and extent to which, it is possible to exploit your success in Palestine with forces now under your command, plus the division under orders for Mesopotamia.&quot;Message of congratulation toGeneral Allenby.Proclamation,The western front:Passehendaele.The Invasion ofItaly.6. The War Cabinet asked The Secretary of State for War to send a message of congratulations-tion to General Allenby on his fine achievement in capturingJerusalem.7. With reference to War Cabinet 277, Minute 6, the WarCabinet had before them the text of the proclamation prepared byLord Curzon, in conjunction with Sir Mark Sykes (Appendix) The Prime Minister undertook to go to the House of commons that afternoon, and to read the proclamation there.8. Whh reference to War Cabinet 285, Minute 4, the Directorof Military Operations said that he had investigated the report about our guns being out-ranged by the Germans at Passehendaele,and had found that there was no truth in the report.9. The Director of Military Operations said that General Plumerreported increased artillery activity opposite our lines. Two attemptshad been made to cross the Piave, but these had failed. Slightprogress had been made by the enemy on the Asiago Plateau.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to ask General Plumer to sendan appreciation of the Italian position.Attack on Austrian 10. The   First  Sea  Lord  reported that  two   old AustrianBattleships. battleships had been attacked by motor-boats in Trieste Harbour.One had been sunk, and the other damaged.
Archangel,Naval Allied 12. The First Lord raised the question of issuing to the pressCouncil. an abridged communication in regard to the Naval Allied Council.All the Governments of the Allies had accepted the statement whichit was proposed to publish simultaneously on the 13th December.The War ( cabinet decided that This question should be raised again on the following day.Explosion atHalifax, KS.13. With reference to War Cabinet 295, Minute 10, the WarCabinet decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer should be asked to make astatement in the House that afternoon, saying that atelegram of sympathy was being sent to Ottawa, and stating the amount of the contribution which this country was proposing to give.Greece: supplies for.14. With reference to War Cabinet 295, Minute 7, Lord Milnerasked what progress had been made in regard to the shipment ofsupplies to the Greeks.Lord Derby undertook to keep Lord Milner informed as to despatch.The Food 15. With reference to War Cabinet 266, Minute 1, and war situation. Cabinet 285, Minute 15, the War Cabinet reviewed the present and prospective food situation in the light of the following documents : The Food Situation. Memorandum bv Lord Rhondda (Paper G.-180).Shortage of Pn-eadstuffs.    Memorandum  by Lord Rhonddai (Paper G.T.-2744).Minimum Requirements of Finance for Imported Foodstuffs in1918. Memorandum by Lord Rhondda (Paper G.T.-2778).Minute by Mr. Austen Chamberlain (Paper G.T.-2876).Lord Rhondda.summarised the most important features of thesituation set forth in the above memorauda. A few months ago itwas hoped to have in this country on the 31st December a sixmonths&apos; reserve of wheat. That reserve had now been reduced toone of about twenty weeks, owing to the diversion of cargo toFrance and Italy. The supplies arriving from abroad at presentwere only about one-half Of what were being received during the sameperiod last year. The consumption of home-grown meat, on the otherhand, was from 15 to 20 per cent, higher than last year. The cerealprogramme was threatened with disaster in two vital points : (a.) It assumed an exportable surplus from North America of ,000,000 tons, which Mr. Hoover now put at 3,600,000tons ;(6.) There was grave dauger that the Argentine surplus ofwheat and maize might be diverted elsewhere owing to lack of money to make the necessary purchases.[1365-296] C11. With reference to War Cabinet 293, Minute 9, the first sea Lord asked for instructions in regard to withdrawing H.M.S.&quot;Iphigenia&quot; from Archangel. Having regard to the fact that itwas impossible to reinforce the &quot; Iphigenia &quot; the Admiralty were anxious to withdraw the vessel, and also the Staff, as soon as possible from Archangel to Murmansk.The War Cabinet decided that H.M.S. &quot;Iphigenia&quot; should be withdrawn.
There had been instances, as in the case of bacon and lard,when supplies were available in the States, but owing to want ofmoney they were diverted from this country. A joint organisation had been set up in the United States, with Mr. Hoover as chairman,for the consideration of the demands of the Allies and tbe claims ofthe United States. Every claim for the following month&apos;s supply had to be put forward by the 15th of each month, with an assurance that both dollars and tonnage would be forthcoming. If these claims were not ready and properly supported by the ] 5th, the supplies forthe. following month would he lost. We required credits at the rateof 57,000,000 dollars a. month, apart from 8,000,000 dollars requiredfor Army supplies. The Treasury bad granted only 20,000,000dollars f t December, and held out prospects of not more than from5,000,000 to 10,000,000 dollars for January. It was essential thatwe should be enabled to make purchases before the loth of thismonth. That day was the 12th, and the matter was thus one of extreme urgency. The long queues outside the distributing shops,to which Mr. Austen Chamberlain bad drawn attention, were due tothe shortage of supplies, and were directly accountable for not a little of the industrial discontent which prevailed.Sir Robert Chalmers said that the position was one in which thesympathies of the Treasury were entirely with the Food Controller,but all the dollars available were already pooled and were beingdistributed by the American Hoard. Mr. Austen Chamberlainpresided over the American Board in this country which determined the allocation to the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Munitions,and to other claimants. They could not add to the dollars in the pool, and, indeed, the Americans were anxious to reduce rather thanincrease our allowance. Lord Reading had done his utmost in theUnited States and in Canada to obtain every dollar possible for thiscountry.Mr. Wintour said that he understood that the food credits hadbeen arranged by Lord Reading, but when the Ministry of Food putforward their claims they found the credits already assigned to forward purchases for the Ministry of Munitions and to themaintenance of the exchange for other articles. In other words,priority over food had been given roc only to munitions and other government purchases, but to unessential imports.Sir Robert Chalmers said the whole matter was one of high andgrave policy, on which he thought the Cabinet would wish to havethe views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer wTas at that moment engaged upon the considerationof the problem with representatives of the United States and lord reading.The War Cabinet decided that The Prime Minister and Lord Rhondda should at once seethe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the american representatives.At a later stage the Prime Minister and Lord Rhondda returnedto the War Cabinet and announced that a satisfactory arrangementhad been made.K^ffSd1 j , 16- T^e Cabinet had before them the following documentsFood Production.      dealinS Wlth *ood Production :-Memorandum by Lord Milner (Paper G.T.-2352).Memorandum by Mr. Long (Paper G.T.-2374).Memorandum by Mr. Munro (Paper G.T.-2430).Memorandum by Mr. Prothero (Paper G.T.-2767).Memorandum by Professor Leonard Hill (Paper G.T.-2827)Memorandum by Lord Derby (Paper G.T.-2854).
Mr. Prothero said that the original programme, which contem-plated the ploughing up of 3,000,000 acres of grass land, had been revised in the light of experience. The aim now was to increase thearea under the plough, as compared with the 191(5 area, by (a) the breaking up of 2,050,000 acres of permanent pasture, and (b) the ploughing of 645,000 acres of temporary grass, in addition to thearea of temporary grass which would have been ploughed in thenormal way, making a total of 2,695,000 acres to be added to thearea already under crops in 1916. This figure was for England andWales. There was still a chance of realising this programme,particularly if the labour asked for were forthcoming. In his memorandum (Paper G.T.-2767) he had asked for a total of 48,500labourers, of whom a proportion might be women. The mostimportant element in the labour supply was skilled ploughmen. Itwas no use having an increase of unskilled labour without a dueproportion of skilled. Recently nearly a thousand skilled ploughmenhad been supplied by the War Office on a two months&apos; agriculturalfurlough from France. About 500 German prisoners had alsorecently been assigned for use on the land, but although the con-ditions laid clown by the War Office for the use of these prisoners had been in some degree relaxed, they were still too stringent toallowr of the farmers making the fullest use of the prisoners. Of the 8,500 skilled plorighmen required. 4,500 were needed at once, and theremaining 4,000 by the end of February. The ploughing season forthis winter was nearly over.In this connection attention was drawn to the memorandum bythe Secretaxw of State for War (Paper G.T.-2854), dated the4th December, in which it was stated that 2,000 expert ploughmenfrom France were then being distributed, and that a trade-card indexfor the forces at home was being compiled, with the help of which itmight be possible to discover a further source of supply.Sir Auckland Geddes said that his Department was on the look-out in various directions for skilled ploughmen. Some might befound in the home army, and a few working on munitions and onaerodomes ; but he was certain that the only large pool of Britishskilled agricultural labour left was the army overseas. negotiations were proceeding with a view to importing up to 20,000 Danes. Mostof these would be drawn from the towns and the distributing trades,but some of them might prove to be from the land ; also he thought the better use of prisoners of war should be immediately considered.Mr. Prothero said that wdierever experiments had been triedwith the Danes they had been found to be good workers. A scheme had been put forward with a view to bringing over farmers fromScbleswio-Holstein, but it had fallen through, partly because ofshipping difficulties and partly because there were objections onaccount of espionage. As to the suggestion that Irishmen might bebrought across, it was found that our labourers at home objected tothem. The only other source was to appeal to Sir Douglas Haig for more&apos;&apos; German prisoners from behind the lines. It was found that prisoners had not shown any desire to escape from this country,particularly those who were Poles and Saxons.Mr. Munro said that the situation in Scotland was very much the same as in England and Wales. There was a serious shortage in the supply of soldier labour, and when obtained it was oftenfound to be of poor quality. Unless more and better soldier labourwas forthcoming the programme for 1918 would be jeopardised.The WTar Cabinet decided  (a.) To resume the discussion on the following morning, whenrepresentatives of the War Office and of the Prisonersof War Committee could be present.(6.) That Sir Auckland Geddes should expedite the arrange-meuts for importing Danes, and should examine thequestion of bringing over farmers from Schleswig-Holstein.
Wages of Piece-workers andAircraftWoodworkers.17. Mr. Barnes and Sir Auckland Geddes were empowered byfche War Cabinet to make the best terms possible in dealing with theapplication to piece-workers of the 12^ per cent, increase under theorder issued by the Ministry of Munitions.They were further empowered to make the best terms possiblein respect of the award of Sir William Robinson regarding paymentof wages and conditions of labour granted to men employed on theproduction of aircraft woodwork.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 12, 1917.
APPENDIX.General Sir E. H. H. Allenby, K.C.B., reports: Jerusalem, 2 p.m., December 11, 1917.I ENTERED this city officially at noon to-day with a few of my staff, the commanders of the French and Italian detachments, the heads of the Picot Mission, andthe Military Attaches of France, Italy, and the United States of America. Theprocession was all on foot. At the Jaffa gate I was received by guards representingEngland, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, India, France, and Italy.The population received me well.Guards have been placed over the Holy Places.My Military Governor is in touch with the acting Custos of the Latins, and theGreek representative has been detailed to supervise Christian Holy Places.The Mosque of Omar and the area round it has been placed under Moslem control,and a military cordon composed of Indian Mahommedan officers and soldiers has beenestablished round the mosque. Orders have been issued that no non-Moslem is to passthis cordon without permission of the Military Governor and the Moslem in charge ofthe mosque.The following proclamation was read in my presence to the population in Arabic,Hebrew, English, Erench, Italian, Greek, and Russian from the steps of the Citadel, andhas been posted on the walls : &quot; Proclamation of Martial Law in Jerusalem.&quot; To the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Blessed and the people dwelling in itsvicinity.&quot; The defeat inflicted upon the Turks by the troops under my command hasresulted in the occupation of your city by my forces. I therefore here and nowproclaim it to be under martial law, under which form of administration it willremain so long as military considerations make it necessary.&quot; However, lest any of you should be alarmed by reason of your experience atthe hands of the enemy who has retired, I hereby inform you that it is my desire that every person should pursue his lawful business without fear of interruption.Furthermore, since your city is regarded with affection by the adherents of three off the great religions of mankind, and its soil has been consecrated by the prayersand pilgrimages of multitudes of devout people of these three religions for manycenturies, therefore do I make known to you that every sacred building, monument,holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place ofprayer, of whatsoever form of the three religions, will be maintained and protectedaccording to the existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faiths they aresacred.&quot; Guardians have been established at Bethlehem and on Rachel&apos;s tomb. Thetomb at Hebron has been placed under exclusive Moslem control.&quot; The hereditary custodians of the Wakf at the gates of the Holy Sepulchrehave been requested to take up their accustomed duties in remembrance of themagnanimous act of the Caliph Omar, who protected that church.&quot;
