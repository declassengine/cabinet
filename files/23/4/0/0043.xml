Two Divisions,which had been retiring through the mountains on the Italian left,had apparently been out off by the enemy, as the Germans claimed17,000 prisoners and 80 guns. The amount of resistance offered bythe Italians on the River Livenza was disappointing. A con-siderable proportion of the Italian forces had reached the RiverPiave. The actual defensive line on the river itself was weak andimprovised. Defensive lines, however, had been constructed sometime previously behind the Piave, covering Treviso. The Piaveitself was generally fordable throughout its course, but a marshon the right front might afford some protection, and the italians were endeavouring to flood it. There would seem to be a reasonable269]
chance of the enemy being checked at Piave, and if the Italianscould hold out for another ten days the situation might be relieved,as the French reinforcements would then have arrived. If the Piaveline were carried, there was nothing to prevent Venice from falling into the hands of the enemy, and the next line of defence wasthe Brenta. A retirement from Piave might, however, lead tfb adebacle. A line of defence, running into lagoons on the east, hadbeen prepared along the River Brenta, covering Padua.General Maurice, from his own observations during his recent visit to Italy, described the system of defences, which were well dug,well sited and concreted, but they were too linear and had no depth.What was necessary under modern conditions was an elaboratenetwork of powerfully constructed trenches extending to a consider-able depth. General Maurice said he had pointed this out toGeneral Cadorna, who bad replied that he did not think it possiblethat the enemy could bring up heavy artillery of the calibre andsuch quantities as were employed on the front in France and flanders.General Maurice said that the Italians had captured a documentgiving the Austrian Order of Battle, which showed that only 6German Divisions, under General von Below, had been employed inthe present offensive, thus confirming the information given by ourown Intelligence Department. On the whole Italian front therewere 44 Austrian Divisions, which, with the 6 German Divisions,gave a total of about 477,000 rifles. Before the present battle theItalians had had the disposal of 1,000,000 rifles, including availablereserves of trained infantry. General Maurice thought that the rapidity of the enemy advance would have prevented him, so far,from bringing up his heaviest artillery.The Western Front2. The Director of Military Operations stated that the Frenchreported that one enemy Division had been withdrawn from Alsace,and its destination might be the Trentino. There were now 149German Divisions on the Western front, 83 on the Eastern, and 6oh the Italian. One German Division had also been withdrawnfrom the Eastern front to the West, and its place had been takenby another Division from the latter front.salonica.3. The Director of Military Operations reported that the enemy forces on the Salonica front had been reinforced by 21 BulgarianBattalions. The reinforcement had probably taken place in response to the present Greek mobilisation. General Milne had reportedthat he saw at present no signs of- the enemy attacking on his front,and he thought it unlikely that they would attempt this unless theyhad considerable German support.Palestine.anwiij-aid finoano i4. The Director of Military Operations described, with the aid of a map, the present operations in Palestine. The right of thenext position north of that just captured by our troops had alreadybeen turned by a detachment advancing along the coast. general allenby had taken the necessary precautions to protect his right flank by means of strong detachments towards Hebron. He had sofar captured over forty guns. Owing to his troops being scattered over a wide front, it was difficult for him to get accurate informationas to the number of prisoners taken.With reference to War Cabinet 268, Minute 1, General Mauriceread out a draft congratulatory telegram from the War Cabinet toGeneral Allenby, which was approved by the Cabinet.
German &quot;warships in the North Sea.6. With reference to War Cahinet 267, Minute 10, the first sea Lord stated that a preliminary examination of some of the prisoners showed that the German vessels were unarmed fishingcraft. Our men mistook them for minesweepers. The prisoners,of whom there were sixty-six in all, were surprised at treatmentthey were receiving, as they had been led to expect that they wouldbe shot.The Invasion ofItaly and theControl of naval forces in the adriatic.7. With reference to War Cabinet 268, Minute 3, the FirstLord of the Admiralty said that he was doubtful whether thepresent was the psychological moment to press for the naval controlof the Adriatic. Our chief concern had been to persuade theItalian Government to detach some of their surplus destroyers forsubmarine hunting and convoy work. A message, however, had just been received from our naval attache at Rome stating that theItalian Ministry of Marine were expecting an attack by Austrian fastcraft on the east coast of-Italy, with the object of cutting off raihvaycommunication, and implying that they were about to ask for naval assistance from us. This was a new feature in the situation whichwas not before the War Cabinet at the discussion on the previous day.Mr. Balfour said it was important to bear in mind the strongpacifist feeling in Italy. First Lords of the Admiralty hadfrequently protested against the failure of the Italians to make thebest use of their ships, but the answer given was that the coastaldeputies would not allow the Government to remove the destroyerson account of the dauger of &quot; tip and run &quot; raids.The First Sea Lord said there were two questions involved :the question of a naval offensive against Austria, and the better useof the forces in the Adriatic- assuming the present uaval policy tobe continued. The Italian hrrces, in the shape of small craft, were undoubtedly more than were needful to carry on the present policy.On the other hand, if an offensive against the Austrian islands were proposed, it would be necessary to increase the forces by drawingon the French Navy the only possible source. It was not possiblefor us to spare more ships. We had at present in the Adriatic fourlight cruisers, two monitors, and some drifters. The French havenominally ten destroyers in the Adriatic.With regard to control, Admiral Jeliicoe felt certain that theItalians w-ould not surrender to us the naval control of the Adriatic,and to attempt to obtain the control of the Mediterranean from theFrench would be very unpopular in France and would strain ourcordial relations with the French navy. The position in theMediterranean at present was that our Admiral at Malta had chargeof patrols and convoys under the French Commander-in-Chief, whocoiild withdraw any craft at any time. For the same purpose someItalian ships were similarly under our Admiral, but- not the numberfor which we had asked. Further, in considering the inactivity ofthe French and Italian battle fleets, it must be remembered thattheir position was somewhat analogous to that of our fleet in theNorth Sea. It was not possible to reach the Austrian fleet except by attacking land fortifications. Such attacks wovdd hardly affectthe present military situation. On the whole, Admiral Jeliicoethought that what the Italians now feared were &quot; tip and run &quot;raids on their east coast.The War Cabinet were of opinion that, as the Prime minister had already left Italy, the subject would be more advantageouslydiscussed on his return, and that in the meantime the First SeaMesopotamia. fj. The Director of Military Operations said that, in his recent operations, General Maude had captured 17 officers and 302 rank and file.   His intention was to withdraw to-day to Samarrah.
Kussia.Command of australian Troops.Lord should endeavour to obtain more precise information as to italian intentions. Should a definite request for naval assistance bereceived, the question of conditions as to control would then beconsidered.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet telegrams dealing with the Russian situation which had just been received from Petrograd and Stockholm (No. 1771 fromSir George Buchanan ; Nos. 3142 and 3150 from Sir E. Howard).9. With reference to a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (Paper G.T.-2535), the War Cabinet further discussed thequestion of the command of the Australian troops (War Cabinet 261,Minute 9, and War Cabinet 262, Minute 2).Attention was drawn to the fact that Mr. Hughes&apos;s telegramof 25th September had not been referred to the War Cabinet,as requested by him.Sir George Fiddes explained that the Colonial Office had beenin communication with the War Office on the subject.The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat, as far as the question of unity of command was concerned,that was now settled in the sense desired by Mr. Hughes. Allfive. Australian Divisions were now under General Birdwood&apos;command, though one of them, owing to shortage of men, wasbeing treated as a depot division. If, as a result of the referendumnow contemplated by the Commonwealth Government, compulsory service were introduced in Australia, and the number of Divisionsrestored to five or even increased to six, there would probably beno difficulty in still retaining them under a single command, thoughit might be necessary to organize them in two corps. As regardsthe Australian request for a special representative attached to theWar Office, there was no objection, but he believed that the request was based on a misunderstanding. The Australian forces already had their own headquarters in London, and w*ere in exactly thesame position in that respect as the Canadian forces. In the telegramfrom the Governor-General, dated the 26th September, no mentionwras made of this representative.The War Cabinet decided that The War Office and the Colonial Office,should draw up, in con-sultation, a telegram to be sent to Australia, stating thatthe question of the command had been settled in themanner desired by the Australian Government, and explaining the reasons for the delay in replying toMr. Hughes&apos;s telegram of the 25th September-the tele-gram to be submitted to the War Cabinet on Monday, the12th November.Ministry of -Food:Office Accommoda-tion.10- The War Cabinet decided to appoint a Committee, con-sisting of Mr. Barnes (Chairman),Mr. Long,Lord Rhondda,Sir A. Mond,to decide as to an application made by the Ministry ofFood for further staff accommodation urgently required inconnection with the scheme for distributing sugar.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,November 9, 1917.
