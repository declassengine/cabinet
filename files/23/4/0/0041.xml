The western front.The Invasion ofItaly.1. THE Director of Military Intelligence reported that the onlyinformation he had to give, supplementary to Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig&apos;s communique, was that during the latest operations on the Passchendaele Ridge we had captured up to date 43 prisoners,I gun, and 12 machine-guns.   Our own casualties amounted only toII officers and 383 other ranks. The capture of Passchendaele andthe adjoining villages was important, and constituted a good*step forward. One small piece of higher ground in this locality still remained to be captured.2. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that a telegram&quot;had been received that morning from Lord cavan, who reportedthat it was difficult at present accurately to appreciate the situation.The position was undoubtedly anxious, but by no means desperate.The Italian Second Army was in a very bad state, but the others were recovering. In spite of the serious shortage of guns, lord cavan thought that, if the Italians really put up a fight, the line ofthe Piave could be held. Our own concentration could not becompleted until the 20th instant, and the anxious time would be between the 15th and 22nd. If the Piave line fell the situation would be critical.British 3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that a telegramConcentration. bad been received from Lord Cavan regarding the point of con-centration for the British reinforcements in Italy.   Our own military representatives and General Cadorna had agreed on a certain Ideality,which the War Cabinet were asked to approve.The War Cabinet decided To record their approval of the locality, so far as they were ina position to judge, but that it must be left to the PrimeMinister to confirm that approval, and to communicate itto the Italian Government.The Director of Military Intelligence was instructed tocommunicate this decision to the Prime Minister throughthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff.4. The Director of Military ( Intelligence reported that theItalians had failed to hold the line of the Tagliamento, and that theyhad already retired a distance of some 20 miles from the river.The Third Army had placed rear-guards on the River Livenza, who,so far, were not being pressed by the enemy. The Second army were on the left of the Third Army, and continued the Hue of theLivenza north wards. The Fourth Army was falling back from theCarnic Alps.Ttal ere&quot;Ce ^ ?\ With reference to War Cabinet 264, Minute 2, the Director- of Military Intelligence made the following report regarding themain decisions reached at the recent Conference in Italy : (a.) That the Prime Minister had approved the despatch oftwo additional British Divisions to Italy, to be accom-panied- by 60-prs. and 6-inch howitzers, the wholeBritish Force to be commanded by General Sir HerbertPlumer, whom the Prime Minister was to meet in Parison his return journey ;(b.) That the situation was unquestionably grave, and that french and English assistance was certainly sorelyneeded, but to what extent it is impossible to say atpresent;   &apos;
3 WO 267.(c.) That General Foch and General Sir Henry Wilson should remain for the present at the Italian Headquarters in an advisory capacity ;(d.) That General Cadorna  should relinquish the supreme command of the Italian Armies, and should come on tothe Inter-Allied Advisory General Staff.Russia. 6. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that GeneralKnox had reported that it was probable that General Sherbacheffwould succeed to the Chief Command of the Russian Army. GeneralSherbacheff had lately been commanding on the Roumanian Front.He was not a man of strong character, and was said to be entirely inthe hands of the Committees.Palestine.7. Mr. Bonar Law informed the War Cabinet that a telegram had just been received from General Allenby to the effect that thesecond Turkish position at Tel-el-Sheria had been captured by our troops.Publication ofSalonica Despatch.8. Lord Derby asked the approval of the War Cabinet to thepublication of General Milne&apos;s last despatch from Salonica. He saidthat it had been examined very carefully at the War Office, who were satisfied that there was no objection to publication after twounimportant excisions had been made.The War Cabinet sanctioned publication of the despatch in the amended form.Submarines. 9. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the Special Servicevessel &quot; Puma&quot; had been sunk, presumably by torpedo, in theMedite rra n ean.Our Naval Attache at Petrograd reported that the Russiansubmarine &quot; Gepard &quot; was now twelve days overdue, and it was feared that she had been lost.A message from Stockton stated that a torpedo had been fired atthe last vessel of a convoy, but had missed. The armed trawler&quot;John Gillman &quot; had fired one shot, and exploded mine-sweeps andtwo depth charges.   A large quantity of oil had come to the surface.German warships in the North Sea.10. With reference to War Cabinet 263, Minute 10, the deputy first Sea Lord said that the Admiralty Avas still awaiting a further report regarding the attack on German warships in the Cattegat,which would be submitted as soon as the interrogation of the enemyprisoners had been completed.The War Cabinet agreed that, if the later report confirmed thefirst estimate of enemy losses, it was desirable that a communiqueshotdd be made to the Press demonstrating the inaccuracy of theGerman official report, which so far admitted the loss of the armedcruiser only.Shipping Losses. 11- The First Lord ox the Admiralty drew the attention of theWar Cabinet to the fact that, while our losses from enemy sub-marines in September had been the lowest during the summer months, those incurred in October had been somewhat heavier. Itwas evident that the Germans, for political purposes, had made an exceptional effort in October. They had now fewer submarinesoperating than at any time during the last six months.
Naval command in theMediterranean.12. The First Lord said that he hoped that better results mightshortly be achieved in the Mediterranean as regards anti-submarinedefence, as the result of the new Allied organisation that had been set up at Malta under Admiral Oalthrop. *United States 13. The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumSeaplane Bases (Paper G.T.-2419) by the First Lord of the Admiralty, as to thein Ireland. responsibility for the cost of establishing United States seaplanestations in Ireland.The First Lord stated that he had raised this point with a viewto a ruling being obtained as to the principle to be adopted in futurecases of this nature, so that uniformity might prevail in the action taken by the Army and the Navy as regards the acquisition of landin the United Kingdom for the use of the forces of the UnitedStates, and the payment for the construction of buildings, &amp;c, thatmight be put up by ourselves for the use of the Americans. he added that the United States representatives in this countryappeared to be quite willing to pay for any works, as well ascompensation for disturbance in tbe case of land that it may benecessary to acquire for that purpose.The Secretary of State for War proposed that, as regards theacquisition of land, the existing procedure should be continued,namely, that the same should be obtained through the LandDepartment.The First Lord concurred in continuing the present practice inthis matter.The War Cabinet decided that Any expenses that might be incurred as regards works and land should, in the first instance, be met from British Votes,the necessary recoverjT being afterwards made from theUnited States GoArernment ; further, that as regards theacquisition of sites, they should, so far as possible, be selected on untenanted land.Position of theRussian soviet representative atan Inter-AllyCouncil.14. Mr. Barnes stated that there was a good deal of feeling in theLabour world regarding the claims and position of M. Skobeleff, therepresentative of the Russian Soviet about to visit the western allies, and that the British Labour Party were closely watching thesituation. He had learned from M. Mantoux that it was conceivable that if the admission of a representative of the Soviet to an Inter-Ally Council was permitted, certain elements among the FrenchSocialists would put forward a similar claim for representation. Onthe other hand, the Soviet was at the present moment mostunpopular with the bulk of the French Socialists.It was pointed out that the difficulty lay in the fact that theForeign Office gathered that the Soviet representative might be putforward as a representative of the Russian Government.The War Cabinet expressed a desire to learn the views of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs upon the matter atan early date.Potatoes.15. With reference to War Cabinet 257, Minute 11, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by Lord Rhondda(Paper G.T.-2517) and a Memorandum by the Secretary forScotland (Paper G.T.-2416).Lord Rhondda stated that very careful consideration had beengiven to what had proved to be a most difficult problem concerningboth the method of carrying out the Prime Ministers promise to thegrowers of a guaranteed price of 61. per ton free on rail or on board,and the disposal of  the  surplus potato crop, which amounted
(Release of 16. The War Cabinet had under consideration the reports ofWines and Spirits the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-2402) and the Central Controlfrom Bond. Board (Li quor Traffic) (Paper G.T.-2441), as to an increase in thewithdrawal of wines and spirits from bond.Lord Rhondda pointed out that there was a shortage of wineand spirits, though there was a large stock of the former in bond,and that he had received strong representations from the tradeurging the desirability of a freer issue from bond of wines andspirits.approximately to 2,000,000 tons over and above the anticipatedordinary requirements for human consumption. He recommendedthat alternative (D) (referred to in G.T.-25T7) which provided forthe abolition of a minimum price and the payment to the grower ofthe difference between what he received and 61. a ton-should beadopted, although he recognised that this would involve theExchequer in considerable loss. Lord Rhondda much regretted that, in his opinion, it was impracticable for the Government topurchase the entire potato crop, or even the entire surplus, withoutthe establishment of a new and very large organisation, which couldnot be formed in time to deal with the matter this autumn.Scheme (D) allowed for purchases by the Government, and he hopedthat prices might be obtained next spring, for the government purchases to be made now, which would diminish the loss on theExchequer. Lord Rhondda stated that the amount, which heestimated at about 5,000,000Z., wotdd largely be expended in theform of subsidies to the growers in Ireland and Scotland ; verylittle would go to England.Mr. Wintour pointed out that, altogether apart from thequestion of price and purchase, there was the question of thedisposal of the surplus. The manufacture of flour or alcohol frompotatoes was a costly process, and with potatoes at 61. per ton wasnot a commercial proposition ; it would therefore be impossible to dispose of the surplus without loss to the Exchequer. mr. Duke stated that Scheme (D) would be difficult to justify on purely economic grounds, and undoubtedly Ireland would receivethe principal benefit under the scheme. He feared that withpotatoes at 61. per ton, Irish pig breeders and pig feeders would usegrain rather than potatoes for their purposes. He drew attention tothe existence of a big potato-buying association in the North ofIreland, and understood that the Ministry of Food were already in communication with them with a view to effecting purchases. Hethought this association might be able to deal with nearly the wholeof the Irish surplus.Mr. Prothero agreed that, under the existing circumstances,Scheme (D) probably afforded the best way of dealing with thematter, although he had been in favour of purchasing the crop, and,in a general way, with the recommendations put forward in theMemorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.The Secretary for Scotland, while, from the point of view ofsimplicity and cost, preferring his own scheme, concurred generally with Mr. Prothero.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed the hope that ifScheme (Dj were approved, Lord Rhondda, subject to there being no wastage in our food supply, would do all in his power to lessen the loss to the Treasury.Lord Rhondda stated that this was his intention.The War Cabinet decided To accept Scheme (D), on the understanding that the FoodController would do his&apos; utmost, by purchases and re-saleat a suitable time, to reduce the demand on the Treasury.
Lord D&apos;Abernon was opposed to the issue from bond of furtherspirit or any of the heavier wines, but not to the release of certainlight wines, based on the principle of alcoholic strength.The War Cabinet decided that There should not be any increase as regards the amount ofspirit to be released, but that, as regards wines, theFood Controller and the Chairman of the Central control board should, after consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, submit proposals as to a further release from bond of such wines as they might think desirable.Purchase of dutch Produce.17. With reference to the Memorandum (Paper G.T.-2490) bythe Foreign Office, relative to the purchase of Dutch produce, &amp;c,the War Cabinet decided that The following Committee, consisting of Lord Milner (in the Chair),Lord Rhondda,Lord Robert Cecil,Mr. Stanley Baldwin,should enquire into the matter and forward their recom-mendations to the War Cabinet.Legality of Actsunder the Defenceof the realm regulations.18. The War Cabinet had a brief discussion on the opinion ofthe Law Officers of the Crown (G.-165) on the legality of certainacts done under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and decidedto defer taking any action until the Law Officers of the Crown couldbe present.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 7, 1917.\o
