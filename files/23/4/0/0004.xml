That the Irish Department forthwith issue the followingnotice: &quot; The Government have informed the department that the War Office will buy oats in Ireland for Armypurposes on and after the 15th November, when thisyear&apos;s crop will be fit for Army purposes, and thatthey will be prepared to pay 38s. 6d. per quarter of312 lb. on rail or in store for clean, sound oats in good condition.&quot;(2.)
