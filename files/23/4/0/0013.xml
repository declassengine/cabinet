The Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military Operations stated that the northernportion of the Second Army and the southern portion of the FifthArmy attacked on a front of 9,000 yards chiefly north of the MeninRoad this morning, and that, with the exception of a portion of thefront south of the Polygon Wood, had gained all their objectives byS a.m. The greatest depth of file advance was 2,000 yards. Thisgave us the southern portion of the Ridge.Air said. 2. The Director of Military Operations stated that during an air raid the previous night, only one or two of the enemy aeroplanespenetrated the London defences, and it seemed probable that about ten enemy machines took part in the attack. Eight incendiary bombs were dropped in Deptford, and five explosive bombs inBermondsey, four people being killed and fourteen injured at thelatter place. The machines that were driven away visited Folkestone,where six bombs were dropped, but no casualties or damage resulted.East Africa. 3. The Director of Military Operations stated that the reports from East Africa were good, and that the 25th Cavalry, which had recently arrived from India, had cut the communications of one ofthe enemy forces, and captured a supply depot and its garrison.There were indications that recent actions had resulted in heavy casualties to the enemy, and the prospects as regards further operations were promising.Arabia. 4. The Director of Military Operations reported that a party of arabs, under the command of Captain Lawrence, had carried out a raid near Maan, and had derailed a train and two carriages andblown up a bridge. They had killed 70 Turks and 2 german officers and captured 80 more Turks.Escape of German 5. The War Cabinet drew the attention of the Director ofPrisoners. Military Operations to reports in the press as to the escape ofGerman prisoners from Suit on Bonnington, near Nottingham, it being alleged that they were in possession, of bundles of food and clothing and a detailed map showing the roads to the coast, andthat the means of escape had been by w-ay of a tunnel which theyhad dug 40 yards in length.The War Cabinet requested Major-General Maurice to obtain and forward to them a reporton the circumstances of the escape, with any remarks theArmy Council might wish to offer on the same.Submarines. 6. The First Sea Lord reported the following attacks on enemy submarines : (a.) On the 25th instant, in the vicinity of Portland, a seaplanedropped four 100-lb.&apos; bombs on a submarine as shesubmerged, three of which exploded. A large quantityof oil was aflerwards seen in the vicinity.(6.) An enemy submarine, after sinking a French ship, brokesirrface in the vicinity of another French and a british ship, both of wMch hit the submarine by gun-fire and claimed to have sunk her. She went down, leaving adense volume of black smoke over the spot.(c.) Two seaplanes, when cruising in the vicinity of the NorthHinder Light vessel, dropped four 230-lb. borhbs in the
&quot;Fire at Dunkirk: 7. The First Sea Lord reported that on the 25th instant a fireLoss of Aero was caused at the Aircraft Depot, Dunkirk, by enemy bombs, and engines. l]lat ^e engine repair-shop was totally destroyed, involving the lossof all spare engines and engines under repair, to the number of between 120 and 180; the actual number had not yet been ascertained. The machines in the shop were also damaged. the fire gained a hold because a shell from one of the French anti-aircraft guns put the fire-engine out of action. The First Sea Lordstated that this loss would have a serious effect on the work ofthe Fighting Squadrons based in that vicinity. In reply to aquestion by the War Cabinet, the First Sea Lord stated that the anti-aircraft defence of Dunkirk was in the hands of the French,and the War Cabinet requested him to go into the matter with admiral Bacon, with a view to augmenting the French defences with british anti-aircraft guns, and report in due course.Bombing said onVarssenaereAerodrome.8. The First Sea Lord stated that we carried out a bombingraid on the Varssenaere Aerodrome on the morning of the 24thinstant. Most of the bombs fell amongst the sheds and hangars,and amongst aeroplanes lined up at the Aerodrome.Naval Activity in 9. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that thethe Mediterranean.   Naval Attache at Rome reported that-(a.) On the night of the 19th instant an Italian naval airshipdropped bombs on the shipyard and shipping at Prevlaka,in the Gulf of Cattaro.(6.) On the 22nd instant four enemy aeroplanes attackedOtranto, dropping sixteen bombs, but causing no casualties and little damage.(c.) On the 24th instant two Handley-Page hydroplanes scoutingfrom Grado were attacked by three Austrian machines,and one of the former shot down. Enemy torpedo-boatsattacked the motor-launch which was accompanying ourhydroplanes, but aerial reinforcements and motor-launches arrived at Grado and beat off the enemy.Flotilla Leader&quot; Faulknor &quot;and Destroyer&quot; Nugent&quot; mined.10. The First Sea Lord reported that the flotilla leader&quot; Faulknor &quot; and the destroyer &quot; Nugent&quot; were mined in thevicinity of the West Hinder Lightship on the 25th instant, one manbeing killed and four injured on board the &quot; Faulknor,&quot; but therewere no casualties on the &quot; Nugent.&quot; Both vessels had arrivedat Dover. The First Sea Lord stated that he had seen the damage,and was of opinion that it had been caused by the twovessels coming in contact with our own mine-nets, which had probably been dragged out of position, and that the injuries werenot caused by German mines.Bombardment of 11. The First Sea Lord state.: that one of our monitors had firedOstend- thirty rounds on Ostend harbour during the afternoon of  the25th instant at a range of 27,500 yards, using a smoke-screen.From observations carried out after the bombardment, it appeared that several direct hits were made on the Atelier de la Marine.vicinity of the swell created by an enemy submarinesubmerging. A zigzag stream of oil, about 2 mileslong, was seen later.
Fighting patrols were carried out over the fleet during the day and six hostile seaplanes were encountered, two of which were driven down.Inter-Ally Council. 12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by EordCurzon dealing with the Inter-Ally Council (Paper G.T.-2065).Lord Curzon described the steps which had been taken towardsthe formation of the Council. He said that it was the Americanswho had pressed for the creation of the Inter-Ally Council. Theywere anxious that the three British representatives on the council should be men of the highest position and prestige, whose nameswould carry weight with the American public. With regard to thechairman of the Council, we had pressed that an American should come and take the chair of the Council in London, but our requesthas been twice refused.Mr. C. J. Phillips stated that as the matter was of great import-ance a further representation had been made by telegram to theAmerican Government. In the event of the Americans definitelyrefusing to provide a chairman, it was understood that a Frenchmanwould be nominated, in accordance with arrangements made withM. Clementel, as a quid pro quo for the concession made by theFrench with regard to the place of meeting. The Italians had,however, protested against this nomination.Lord Curzon suggested that the three British representatives should be General Smuts,Lord Buckmaster,Mr. Austen Chamberlain,the last of whom should be Chairman of the British priority committee, which would deal with the British departmental claims.The War Cabinet agreed to this suggestion, provided that theservices of Mr. Chamberlain were not required by theChancellor of the Exchequer for some other work. lord curzon undertook to consult Mr. Bonar Law on the subject.General Smuts accepted the office.Sir Albert Stanley said that the Board of Trade concurred inprinciple in the scheme of an Inter-Ally Council, as set forth in lord curzon&apos;s memorandum, though he thought that the title of theBritish Committee would be improved by omitting the word&quot; Priority.&quot;Sir Leo Chiozza Money agreed with Sir Albert Stanley, havingregard to the fact that there was already a Tonnage priority committee, of which he was chairman, dealing with the tonnage ofthe whole world, whereas the Inter-Ally Council was concerned only with American affairs. All the departments and committeesmentioned at the foot of Lord Curzon&apos;s memorandum were represented on his Tonnage Priority Committee, except the Oil Pool Board.The plan he suggested would be for the Inter-Ally Council or itsPriority Committee to be represented upon the Tonnage priority committee so that the tonnage allocated to American suppliesby the latter could be reviewed by the Inter-Ally Council.Sir L. Worthington Evans had two points to bring forward,which he understood represented the views of Mr. Churchill. he undertook to ask Mr. Churchill to inform Lord Curzon of anyfurther comments that he might wish to make. In the first place,Sir L. Worthington Evans agreed that the word &quot; Priority &quot; was amisnomer, in view of there being a Priority Committee in the Ministryof Munitions, another dealing with Tonnage, and possibly yet another permanent Priority Committee, referred to in War Cabinet237, Minute 6. He said that as this British Committee dealing withour Departmental claims would have practically the same functions as were held by what was previously known as the American Board
(War Oabinet 210, Minute 16 and Appendix), the latter name shouldhe adopted. In the second place, he pointed out that there was no existing machinery for carrying out the policy whereby the UnitedStates Government buy commodities in our markets, e.g., tin, at ourprices, in the same way as we buy in American markets at Americanprices. He suggested that it should be the duty of the AmericanBoard to take cognisance of this work.Mr. Balfour suggested that each Government should treat theother on the most favourable terms as regards purchases of every kind.Sir E. Wyldbore Smith raised the question of the representation on the Inter-Ally Council of the smaller Allies, namely, Belgium,Portugal, Roumania, Serbia, and Greece. In the case of the last three there were two alternatives : their demands should be madeeither through the French representative Council, or through theirown representatives on the Commission Internationale de ravitaillement-ment. He further added that purchases on behalf of the U.S.A.Government were already carried out through this Commission.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that theformer alternative was open to criticism, inasmuch as it would givethe French a certain measure of control over the smaller Powers, towhich they have no claim.The War Cabinet decided That all the smaller Allies should put their- requests forwardthrough the Commission Internationale de&apos;Ravitaillernent.To sum up, the decisions of the War Cabinet were (a.) The general scheme contained in Lord Curzon&apos;sMemorandum shoidd be adopted.(b.) The reply from the American Government in regard to theChairman of the Inter-Ally Council should be awaitedbefore any further step was taken.(c.) Lord Curzon should be asked to see Mr. Bonar Law inregard to the services of Mr. Austen Chamberlain.(d.) That the Committee to deal with the British Departmentaldemands should be known as the &quot;American Board.&quot;(e.) That if any difficulty as to price arises in &quot;the negotiationsof the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement thatCommission should refer the matter to the &quot;AmericanBoard &quot; for settlement.(/.) That all the smaller Allies should put forward theirrequests to the Inter-Ally Council through the Corn-mission Internationale de Ravitaillement.Imperial Mineral 13. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum from theEesources Bureau. Ministry of Munitions on the proposal to set up an Imperial mineral resources Bureau, together with a Report by the Committeeappointed by Dr. Addison (under direction of the War Cabinet),which had prepared a scheme for the establishment of the necessaryorganisation (Paper G.T.-1901). The Committee had comprisedrepresentatives of the Dominions and of the Colonial Office, IndiaOffice, Board of Trade, Ministry of Munitions, Central Reconstructtion Committee, Geological Survey and Imperial Institute.Dr. Addison explained the main features of the Report, and said he would like authority to proceed with the working out of thescheme in detail for submission to the War Cabinet at a later date.There were one or two matters of importance which might needconsideration. There was also Mr. Churchill&apos;s suggestion that theMinister of Reconstruction should account for the moneys votedby the Imperial Parliament for the maintenance of the ImperialMineral Resources Bureau. Dr. Addison suggested that it mightbe thought preferable that this function should be discharged by[1365 239] C
the Head of a Department with executive functions, but he would report on this point later to the War Cabinet.Sir George Cave stated that his Department had not had anopportunity of considering the Memorandum and Report of theCommittee, and as the Home Office was especially concerned withmines he hoped no immediate and final decision would be takem bythe War Cabinet on the proposal.Mr. Long said that if any important change in the report was contemplated it would be necessary for him to inform theDominions.The War Cabinet authorised The Minister of Reconstruction to proceed with the scheme forthe establishment of an Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau,subject to agreement with the Home Secretary, com-communicating as necessary to the Secretary of State for theColonies and the Secretary of State for India any departures from the Report of the Committee. In case of failure toagree, the matter should be again brought before- theWar Cabinet.Coal-miners&apos; 14. Sir Albert Stanley asked the attention of the War Cabinetdemand for to a matter of great urgency arising out of the demand of theincrease of wages. coal-miners for an advance of wages. The Government might be faced with a crisis in the coal trade within twenty-four hours.Since the outbreak of war the wages of the miners had been advanced, either directly or by means of bonus, to about 40 percent, above the pre-war basis. Conditions vary in different areas,but it might be taken that the average rise was about 40 per cent.In some areas there had been no increase for perhaps a year ; in theSouth Wales area an increase had been granted in December last.Some weeks ago a demand had been put forward for an increaseof 25 per cent, on the wages actually earned. As a result of negotiations this had been modified to a demand for an advanceof 10s. per week per man, which would be equivalent to anaverage total increase during the war of 70 per cent. Thedemand for an increase had not been unexpected, and theCoal Controller, in reply, had made an offer of 7s. 6d.,which might be regarded as a fair settlement, as it nearlyapproximated to the increased cost of living to the miners,and would not seriously upset other wage awards. As theMiners&apos; Executive was not authorised to accept less than 10s.,a Conference of the Delegates had been summoned and was meeting that morning. Their reply would be communicated to theCoal Controller that afternoon. From a private and reliable sourcehe (Sir Albert Stanley) had been given to understand that theGovernment offer would be refused. During the last few weeksthere had been several incipient strikes, unrest was widespread, andthe men were impatient and in no mood to brook delay. A decision by the Government would have to be taken to-day, or at latestto-morrow morning. In repty to questions, Sir Albert Stanley saidthat there was now no sliding-scale operation which related thecourse of Avages closely to that of prices. The Governmentcontrolled the price of coal, and in a sense the price was nowartificial. If Parliament ratified the agreement with the mine-owners,which the Cabinet had approved, it would be necessary-if a deficitwas to be avoided to increase the price of coal, but it might bepossible to restrict the increase to industrial consumers. It was estimated that the addition of 7s. 6d. per week to wages would increase the cost of coal by about 19,000,000Z. per annum.The Minister of Labour said it was important that the cabinet should consider the particular case of the miners in relation toactual and possible demands from other workers. The Committeeon Production had called his attention to the Coal Controllers offer
of 7s. Qd. and to the undesirable effects it would have on the generalwages situation. Many of the agreements now in force will have tobe reviewed in October. Several agitations were already on foot,and they would be stimulated if the miners succeeded in their demand. The concession of 10s. per week would be equivalent toan addition of 30s. or 31s. to the wages of the miners duringthe War. The Committee on Production, on the other hand, had tried to keep within a limit of 15s. increase on pre-war wages.If the miners succeed similar demands will most certainly comefrom other sections of industry, and these it would be difficult forthe Government to resist. The policy of the Ministry of Labourrecently had been to harden against further advances because of thefinancial situation of the country. He (Mr. Roberts) and Mr. Clyneshad urged on a deputation a few days ago the duty of taking intoconsideration the reduction in the cost of living which was being brought about by the Food Controller, and had suggested to thetrade-union leaders present the desirability of restraining their menfrom making fresh demands for higher wages, inasmuch as in thepast they had based their claims to an advance on the rising cost ofliving. Mr. Roberts felt strongly that an effort should be made to resist a demand exceeding 7s. Qd. It was for the Cabinet, however,to decide whether the war situation was such as to warrant the riskof a strike by a refusal of the demand for 10s.Sir Albert Stanley stated that Mr. Robert Smillie, during thenegotiations with the Coal Controller, had said that, speaking for himself, he thought it only fair that if the increase of wages were now granted there should be a reduction of wages when the cost ofliving fell. Should a strike take place, some industrial establish-ments which were without stocks of coal would have to close down at once. London was better off at the moment for coal than a yearago. The Navy would very quickly be calling for fresh supplies.The Board of Trade had for some time been urging the GasCompanies to increase their stocks.The War Cabinet felt that the particidar issue raised by thedispute with the miners was one of far-reaching significance and ofthe gravest importance to the State.The War Cabinet decided to adjourn the discussion until thePrime Minister and Mr. Barnes could be present. In themeantime the President of the Board of Trade wasrequested to communicate to the War Cabinet at theearliest moment the resident of to-day&apos;s negotiations.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
