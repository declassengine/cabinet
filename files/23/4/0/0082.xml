WITH reference to War Cabinet 303, Minute 14, LordRothermere said that his Department considered it desirable to withhold the use of the R.T.S. Bullet until there was a sufficiency ofsupply. It would be inadvisable to use the bullets in a piecemealway, because the Germans might, by capturing the bullets from ourairmen, themselves use the invention.General Trenchard said that he considered 1,000,000 bulletswould be required ; when that supply was available they could beused continuously.A letter from Major-General Bingham was read, from which itappeared that the latest trials with the R.T.S. Bullet against bigballoons had not been quite satisfactory, and it was therefore hopedthat the War Cabinet would not ask for the R.T.S. Bullet to besent to France.:   B
The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the bullet proving satisfactory, permission should begiven to the Air Minister for its use as soon as he was satisfied as to sufficiency of supply.^NucleusEstablishment ofAir Force.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySir David Henderson (Paper G.T.-2965). Sir David Hendersonpointed out that the Air Force had at present no permanent estab-lishment such as was in existence for the Navy and Army, and thepresent circumstances wore such that no data were available onwhich to base an accurate estimate of permanent requirements. Itwas considered necessary for the Air Force to have some personnel on a permanent basis, to form a nucleus for the organisation of theservice. The Air Organisation Committee recommended that theAir Council should be authorised to appoint officers and to recruitother ranks up to the number of 2,000 officers and 25,000 men, underthe conditions approved for service other than temporary.Lord Derby said that the proposals of Sir David Henderson were approved by the War Office.The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the approval of the Admiralty, the scheme outlined above should be adopted.The Western Front.3. The Chief of the imperial General Staff reported that theenemy had made an attack near Camhrai, a communique with regardto which had appeared in the press. From information received fromprisoners, it appeared that the German objectives had been our front and support trenches. These they had taken, but later we hadregained tbe support trenches.Palestine.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatGeneral Allenby had made successful advances on the 28th and29th December, and had driven the enemy North and East. Theresult, therefore, of the Turkish attempt to re-capture Jerusalem hadended in the defeat of the Turks, who had suffered heavily in killed and wounded.   We had taken 600 prisoners and 20 machine-guns.Shipping Losses. 5. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff gave the daily returnsin regard to Shipping Losses.Loss of Steamship 6. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff stated that, information&quot;Aragon.&quot; had been received from Alexandria to the effect that the transport&quot; Aragon&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Attack&quot; had been sunk near the entrance to the swept channel. It was uncertain whether they hadbeen sunk by mine or torpedo. The &quot; Aragon&quot; had on boardapproximately 2,100 troops and also a number of first class passengers,amongst whom were several officers and 150 mirses.Vladivostock. 7. The War Cabinet discussed what action, if any, should betaken with regard to the protection of the large accumulation of stores at Vladivostock.With regard to the possibility of naval assistance, the deputy chief of the Naval Staff said that we had one ship now at HongKong, namely, the &quot;Suffolk,&quot; a &quot;County&quot; class cruiser, whichcould be sent to Vladivostock. . . .
Palestine&apos;s Political 8. Attention was called to the recrudescence of French demands-^future- for political rights in Palestine, referred to by M. Pichon in his speech on Friday last. It was understood that M. Clemenceau didnot entirely share the views of the French Foreign Minister, who,in this respect, was voicing the wishes of the Clerical elements ofFrench public opinion.It was further pointed out that the French military contribu-tion in Palestine had been extremely small, and that, for thepresent, at any rate, it was absolutely essential to continue themilitary government of the occupied territory. It would seem thatthe French entertained the immediate hope of an International or Inter-Allied Commission, with a Frenchman at the head of it, totake over political interests in Palestine, and more particularly ofthe Holy Places.War Aims of the 9. The Prime Minister reported that he had had an interestingBritish Labour anc[ successful interview with a deputation from the British Labourar Party regarding war aims.    With   the exception of a certainMr. Bramley, the view of the Labour Party seemed to coincide withthat of the Government. They evinced no desire to throw over thedemand of the French democracy with regard to Alsace-Lorraine, orto raise a quarrel with the Dominion Government regarding thenon-tropical colonies. With regard to the German colonies north ofthe Zambesi, they all agreed that they should not be handed back tothe Germans, and advocated some super-national authority being established to administer them.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked whether theColonial Office could do something to gather the chiefs in the formerGerman colonies together, with a view to some statement of theirwishes.Lord Robert Cecil added that he understood that the Masaitribe in German East Africa was keenly pro-British.The Transport 10. With reference to War Cabinet 305, Minute 1, Lord DerbyProblem. asked what instructions should be given to General Nash, and read a telegram reporting an interview that had taken place betweenCaptain Amery and M. Clemenceau.The Prime Minister stated that M. Clemenceau had wired tohim, accepting General Nash in the place suggested: for Sir eric geddes.   In this case, the same instructions should be given toGeneral   Nash as would have been given to  Sir Eric Geddes.General Nash was clearly designated as chairman of the Inter-AlliedAdvisory Committee.[1365-308] B 2As regards military assistance, it was stated that there washalf a battalion of the Middlesex Regiment which might alsobe sent.The War Cabinet were of opinion, however, that it would betaking an extreme step to send soldiers to Vladivostock, and useless to do so at all, unless they were sent in sufficient numbers.The War Cabinet decided that The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff should obtain the viewsof the Admiralty in regard to sending the &quot; Suffolk &quot; ;and that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should obtain theviews of the General Staff in regard to sending military assistance.
The War Cabinet instructed -The Secretary to draft a personal telegram from the PrimeMinister to the Italian President of the Council, for theForeign Office to communicate, with a view to obtaining the concurrence of the Italian Government in the appoint-ment of General Nash.South Russia. II. The War Cabinet took note of the fact that all executive action with regard to South Russia was concerted by a committeesitting daily at the Foreign Office under the presidency of the acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and on which theWar Office and the Treasury were represented.The War Cabinet directed that The Permanent Military Advisers of the Supreme War council should be invited to report on the military and strategicalposition in the Turkish theatre and South Russia as a whole.Italian internal situation:Food and Coal.12. Attention was drawn to a letter received by the PrimeMinister from Signor Nitti, the Italian Minister of Finance, regardingthe coal and food crisis obtaining in Italy.Lord Curzon stated that he had seen a letter from Mr. Trevelyan,who was acting with the Red Cross in Italy, regarding the same subject. It appeared that there was considerable danger that theItalian moral would weaken owing to the fact that the British troopsin Italy were both better fed and better paid than the Italians.Lord Derby stated that he had had a number of letters fromBritish officers in Italy, who all stated that the supply of coal toItaly was the principal problem exercising the attention of theItalians.Lord Robert Cecil stated that he had preached the desirabilityof sending larger supplies of coal to Italy for months. The french had undertaken to supply 150,000 tons a month by rail, and this appeared to be all that could be expected from them. In his opinion,it was absolutely essential that we should divert more shipping tothe sending of coal to Italy, and, if necessary, we must use shipping-earmarked for other purposes upon this object. He added that wehad not sent anything like the minimum depiands of Italy for many months past.It was pointed out that the British vessels engaged in takingcoal to France were too small to be utilised in taking coal to Italy.The War Cabinet decided that The matter should again be brought by the Secretary to theattention of the Shipping Controller, who should furnishthem with a statement showing what could be done in theway of increasing the supply of coal to Italy.The Italian 13. The War Cabinet took note of, and approved, Joint NoteProblem. Jfo. 6, by the Military Advisers of the Supreme War Council.In this connection it was pointed out that the French werestarting schools for their own officers in Italy, with a view to attract-ing Italian officers to attend them.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that general plumer had done the same, and that General Diaz had been invited to send a certain number of Italian officers to our schools of instruction. Several competent British officers had reported that,since they had been in Italy, they had completely changed their
opinion regarding the quality of the Italian troops, and that, with further instruction, great improvements might be hoped for.The War Cabinet decided that Sir Rennell Rodd should be urged by the Foreign Office to sug-gest to Signor Nitti that the latter should pay a visit to thiscountry at an early date, to discuss the various matters concerning the Italian military and internal situations.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 31, 1917.
