THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet of the substance of a telegram received from general wilson stating that the situation was somewhat better, the smalllocal success at Asiago having had a good effect. &quot;Ihere would stillbe another nine or ten days before anxiety was removed. MeanwhileGeneral Diaz was getting the situation in rear of his line into a lesscongested condition, and was also making the necessary arrange-ments in case of a retreat. The telegram also referred to certain changes made in the relative positions assigned to the French andBritish divisions. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff men-tioned that the Germans had picked up the remains of two more divisions in the mountains, and were now in front of Feltre. EightGerman divisions on other fronts had not been located for some271] B
odays, and it was possible that some, at any rate, of tbese were ontbeir way to the Italian front, in addition to the original six divisions of which we had knowledge.Palestine. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that he had telegraphed to General Allenby to let him have.aan appreciation of the position and his views and proposals withregard to it, as soon as he was able to send them. Judging by thefact that General Allenby had taken the enemy&apos;s advanced posts onhis new line yesterday, it looked as if he meant to get, at any rate,as far as the Jaffa-Jerusalem line. Complete details had not yet arrived about the captures, but they amounted to about SO guns andjust under 6,000 officers and men.Mesopotamia. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, referring to therecent arrival of a Russian detachment of 2,000 to 3,000 men atKasr-i-Shirin (War Cabinet 266, Minute 6), reported that anothersubstantial detachment had reached Mendaleh. These would afford a most useful protection to General Maude&apos;s right flank. In hisopinion, Von Falkenhayn had probably discovered that the Baghdadcampaign was a more difficult task than he had imagined.East Africa. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGerman forces were now collected together in two main bunches,the bulk of which he hoped would be disposed of shortly. Over300 Germans, as well as a considerable number of Askaris, hadbeen picked tip in the last few days, and there was a real hope offinishing the campaign before the beginning of the rains.Lake Garda. 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a naval officer hadbeen sent up to Lake Garda to study the defence of the lake inthe event of any possible naval operations by the Austrians. he did not consider it would be possible to do anything effective in theway of mining the lake.Aerial Actions and bombing Raids.6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported  (a.) Aeroplane encounters off Dunkirk, in which a hostile scouthad been brought down in flames.(6.) Raids on Belgian aerodromes and on the Lule BurgasBridge, in Thrace.The latter raid was unsuccessful in its objective, but succeeded insetting fire to a large forage depot.Naval Losses offGaza.Japanese military co-operation-operation.7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that it was not clear,from a later telegram, whether a French destroyer had actually been sunk. The casualties were not yet fully known, but were very few on H.M.S. &quot;Staunch,&quot; and possibly rather more on themonitor &quot;M. 15.&quot;8. The War Cabinet again discussed the question of possiblemilitary assistance from Japan (War Cabinet 250, Minute 8). Itwas pointed out that, although the United States had expresseditself somewhat doubtfully, the situation as between America and japan had been improved since the recent exchange of notes.Sir C. Greene had also suggested that Japanese public opinion wasbeginning to move in the direction of more active intervention inthe War.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that, sofar, indications had not been very favourable, and that a directofficial request by him for the assistance of two armoured cruisershad as yet met with no reply. -/SeacuAfter some discussion it was decided To consider the question further at a subsequent meeting, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertakingmeanwhile to press the question of the ships.Command of 9. With reference to War Cabinet - 269, Minute 9, the WarAustralian Troops.    Cabinet considered the telegram drafted by the War Office andconcurred in by the Colonial Office.The War Cabinet approved the telegram, subject to the additionof a passage expressing the regret of the Cabinet for the delay inanswering Mr. Hughes&apos; original message.The War Cabinet decided that The telegram as amended (Appendix I), should be sent to theGovernor-General of the Australian Commonwealth.Reference to War 10. With reference to the fact that the telegram from the PrimeCabinet. Minister of Australia had been passed on to the War Office because it dealt with a military question, and had not been referred directly to the War Cabinet as requested in the telegram, the Secretary ofState for War raised the general question as to which Department,in such cases, was responsible for bringing a question before theWar Cabinet, and suggested that the most convenient procedure would be if the Department which first received the request to bring a matter before the War Cabinet should bring it up directly, evenif the subject-matter concerned other Departments.The War Cabinet agreed with this suggestion, and gave ageneral ruling that any explicit request for reference tothe War Cabinet, coming from a responsible source, shouldhe brought to the notice of the War Cabinet by theDepartment receiving the request.Conacientious 11. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a motionObjectors. in the House of Lords on the subject of Conscientious Objectors,standing in the name of Lord Charnwood. There was nothing inthe substance of the motion which the War Cabinet disagreed with,and it was in fact intended as a reply to the scheme put forward byLord Parmoor, which the Secretary of State for War stated that hewould oppose.The War Cabinet considered, however, that It was not desirable that it should be committed to the termsof a definite motion on this subject.The Secretary of State for War undertook to see Lord Charn-wood, and to persuade him  to  content  himself  withexpressing his views in a speech, and not moving  aresolution.Proposed Govern-ment PostalService byAeroplane between london and Paris.[1305-271]12. The War Cabinet had before them a note by Lord Milner(Paper G.T.-2549) (Appendix II), covering a Minute from theSecretary of the Air Board regarding a proposal to establish aGovernment Postal Service by Aeroplane between London and Paris.The note stated that a similar project had been put forward by messrs. Reuters (Limited) and had been considered by the AirBoard, who had agreed to reject it, on the ground that it was.B 2
inadvisable, in the present circumstances, to divert any part of theaerial resources of the country from the pressing needs of the air services.The President of the Air Board said that he had nothing to add to the arguments against the proposal which had been brought forward iu the Air Board note. As, however, the scheme had been,endorsed by the French Prime Minister, he thought it necessarythat the matter should come up for the decision of the War Cabinet.Lord Cowdray said he understood from the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Air. Board that he had seen M. Flandin, a Member of theFrench Chamber of Deputies and Secretary of the French Inter-Departmental Committee upon Civil Aeronautics, who had come tothis country to press the adoption of the scheme, just before he returned to France, and he thought, that M. Flandin fully appreciated the objections which had been explained to him.The Postmaster-General said that he also had interviewedM. Flandin, and had represented to him that, apart from the factthat the beginning of winter was hardly a favourable season for theintroduction of the scheme, this was not an opportune time to adoptit. He had, however, explained to M. Flandin that he had no doubtthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to give it theirsympathetic consideration when the times were more favourable for its acceptance.The War Cabinet agreed as to the cogency of the arguments advanced by the Air Board against the proposal, and decidedthat Having regard to the fact that the whole of our output of aircraft was required for war purposes, the scheme must be rejected, and requested the President of the AirBoard, in consultation with the Postmaster-General, totake the necessary steps to give effect to this decision.(Initialled) A.

WC 271APPENDIX I.Telegram, November 13, 1917.The Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General of the Gommonicealthof Australia.MY telegram of 8th October.With further reference to your telegram of 26th September, I am sure that thePrime Minister will understand how difficult it was to come to a decision in thismatter, and the War Cabinet regret the unavoidable delay in dealing with it.While Australian divisions were employed on the offensive front in Flanders itwas not possible to consider how best to give effect to the request of commonwealth government that all Australian divisions should be grouped together in one command.It has now been arranged that four divisions shall be included in an Australian Corps,and the remaining division affiliated to that corps, acting temporarily as a depotdivision until sufficient reinforcements are available to bring it up to strength. Allfive divisions wiU thus be under General Birdwood&apos;s command. Whole matter hasbeen carefully considered by War Cabinet, who regard above as best practical solutionof the problem at the moment. Cabinet further hope that Commonwealth&quot;Governmentwill find it possible to send sufficient reinforcements to maintain ah five divisions at full strength.As regards question of staff, Army Council strongly urge that the principle ofinterchange of Australian and British officers should be adhered to, but without in anyway binding the Commonwealth Government to receive a fixed proportion of british officers in Australian formations. This principle is one to which commonwealth government, in common with Governments of other oversea dominions, agreed whenImperial General Staff was formed, and if Commonwealth Government will continue toaccept it, War Cabinet are satisfied that the details of its application will be satisfac-satisfactorily arranged between Sir D. Haig and General Birdwood. Main difficulty hitherto,however, has been to get Australian officers for British staffs, and Army Council would welcome for this purpose a largely increased number of Australian officers, who would,of course, be returned to Australian Corps when required to fill staff vacanciesthere. Long.APPENDIX II.Proposed Government Postal Service by Aeroplane between London and paris.(Note by Cord Milner.)THE attached Minute has been sent to me in the absence of General Smuts, bythe Secretary of the Air Board. I think a decision should be given by the Cabinet onthe proposal as soon as possible.Personally I feel that, the disadvantages which are pointed out in the letter are so great that it would be impossible to start the suggested service at present.(Initialled)   M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 9, 1917.
Minute from Secretary, Air Board, to Lord Milner.Lord Milner,M. FLANDIN, a Member of the French Chamber of Deputies, and Secretary ofthe French Interdepartmental Committee on Civil Aeronautics, has come to london to propose a Government postal service by aeroplane between London and Paris.A similar project put forward by Messrs. Reuters (Limited) was recently underthe consideration of the Air Board, and was rejected on the ground that, it wasinadvisable in the &quot;present circumstances to divert any part of the aerial resources ofthe country from the pressing needs of the Air Services.M. Flandin was informed of this attitude before he came to London, but tbeFrench authorities, nevertheless, persist in their project, which has received theapproval of the French Prime Minister. They say that, if the English Governmentis unable to provide pilots and machines, these will be furnished entirely from Frenchsources. They only ask in effect permission to land at an aerodrome near London, theprovision of the necessary sheds, and the motor service for transporting the mail fromthe aerodrome to the post office.The Air Board have given the matter further consideration and are of opinion thatit should be submitted through you to the Cabinet. They see the following objectionsto the proposal: There might be considerable criticism of the employment of pilots at the presenttime on a purely peace service. If, as the French suggest, the pilots in question wouldbe men who had become unfit for service at the front, it would still be objectedthat they might be employed in training pilots or in testing aeroplanes.Even if the machines which the French propose to assign to the service are unfit for use on the front, they might still be used for training, if not by the French, atleast by the Americans.The French machines engaged on the service would have to cross over our coast defences, and, owing to the possibility of their being mistaken for raiders, this is likelyto give rise to difficulty.The enemy would probably soon discover that this service had been established,they would endeavour to attack the aeroplanes conveying the mails, and a demandfor a protective escort would arise which it might be difficult to refuse. In theabsence of protective measures, only unimportant matter could be conveyed by theaerial mail, which would run considerable risk of destruction.Qur own contribution to the service would certainly not in practice be limitedto the provision of facilities for landing, &amp;c. we should be called upon to providepetrol, to recover machines which had met with an accident and had fallen inBritish territory, and so forth.Our own experience shows the extreme difficulty of maintaining a regular service to France. British machines urgently required at the front are constantly held up formany days at Lympne owing to weather conditions.The most serious objection, however, is &apos; no doubt that it would be highly understandable to allow a service of this kind to fall into the hands of the Frenchexclusively. Our own manufacturers show a certain restiveness at having their activities confined strictly to war work ; they constantly seek facilities for advertisingthemselves at home and abroad, with a view to civil work after the war, and drawunfavourable comparisons between the facilities for advertising which have beengranted to them and, e.g., to the Italians and French by their respective governments in this connection. There would certainly be an irresistible demand for the participation of British machines in this service if it is once allowed to be established ;such participation could only be at the cost of the output required to meet our own war requirements, and if British machines participated in the postal service, British pilotswould also have to be furnished.For these reasons it is thought that assent should not be given to the french proposal.But it may be that an Aerial Postal Service between London and Paris would prove a very popular measure, and it is for the Cabinet, to, decide whether there aregrounds for accepting it sufficient to outweigh the disadvantages indicated above.(Signed).        H. P. HARVEY,Secretary to the Air Board.Air Board, November 7, 1917.
