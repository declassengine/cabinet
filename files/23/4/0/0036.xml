Order of the 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 251, Minute 16, referringBritish Empire.        the matter to Lord Crawford and Balcarres, the War cabinet approved -the   recommendations   contained   in   Lord   Crawford&apos;sreport  as  regards the Colonial Office and India Office (paper g.T.-2392) (Appendix I).The Prime Minister requested Lord Crawford to see him at anearly date with a view to discussing the allocation to De made between the Home Departments.Command of australian Troops.2 With reference to War Cabinet 261, Minute 9, the PrimeMinister drew attention to the importance of this matter from thepoint of view of the Australian Government.It was pointed out that the Australians wished to be treated likethe Canadians and desired to have separate Australian divisionswithout any admixture of troops from other parts of the Empire.Mr. Long stated that the Australian Government were nowfinding considerable difficulty in getting men, and that they believedthey would be assisted in obtaining men if it were known inAustralia that their troops would not be spread in different commands,but concentrated under a general officer in whom the Australianshad unbounded confidence.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to circulate to members of theWar Cabinet a full copy of all the telegrams and correspon-dence relating to the matter.Air Raids:Insurance againstDamage.3. With reference to War Cabinet 245, Minute 15, the WarCabinet approved the report of Mr. Stanley Baldwin (Paper G.T.-2429) (Appendix II), and authorised-The Chancellor of the Exchequer to give effect to the proposals contained therein.Ireland: General 4. With reference to War Cabinet 249, Minute 13, the SecretaryConditions. of State for War read a letter he had received from the Commander-in-chief in Ireland (Sir Bryan Mahon), which intimated that thedefiance of the law against drilling was increasing, and that courts-martial were proving quite insufficient to deal with its suppression.If troops were used to put down the drilling, bloodshed would undoubtedly ensue; but the situation was serious, and the authorityof the Government was being openly defied.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that theintroduction of some of the most recent developments of scientificwar, such as tanks, wrould have a beneficial effect in bringing home to the Sinn Feiners the perilous nature of their behaviour. InIreland it was very difficult to draw a line between a game designedto bring the British Government into ridicule and a rebellion.The former frequently developed, almost unconsciously, into thelatter.The Chief Secretary stated that there was considerable differ-ence of opinion among the authorities in Ireland as to the seriousness of the situation. He admitted that in Clare, Kerry, parts of Limerickand West Cork there was more or less determined drilling anddefiance of the regulations. The difficulty was to catch the respon-sible organisers of this drilling red-handed and to secure convictionsbefore courts-martial. The moment the police appeared the SinnFein bands dispersed. The Chief Secretary thought that the mostimportant thing was to enable the Police authorities to keep theirheads up and to prevent anything in the nature of their &apos;beingoverawed by.superior force. It had been stated that Mr. de valera had recently passed round word to the Sinn Feiners to be quiet for
The Invasion of 5. With reference to War Cabinet, 261, Minute 1, the DirectorItaly. of Military Operations reported the receipt of three telegrams fromSir William Robertson from Italian Headquarters. In the firsttelegram, dated the 31st October, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff reported that the situation was bad ; that General Cadorna had told him that the breach which had been made by the enemy was dueto treason on the part of his troops, who had made no effort to oppose the attack. Large numbers of the Second Army had laid down their arms and gone to the rear. Much material and large supplies of aUkinds had been lost.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff further stated in his telegram that General Cadorna was trying to restore order, but thatthere was no real command anywhere; communication betweenunits had been lost, and General Cadorna could not say where theSecond Army and some of the Third Army were. Everything wasin disorder : roads were blocked and bridges cut, and general cadorna would be lucky if he reached the Piave with 25 more or lessintact divisions.British Artilleryin Italy.6. In his second telegram, dated the 31st October, Sir William Robertson reported that he had seen General Hamilton, commandingour artillery, who had said that he had lost 20,000 rounds ofammunition and most of his stores. He thinks about thirty men are missing. He has got all his guns across the Tagliamento, andtherefore hopes that he will save them.British Troops for- Italy.7. In his third telegram, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff reported that General Cadorna wished to see Lord Cavan on his arrival in Italy; Sir William Robertson had discussed the place of concentration, and could not agree to General Cadorna&apos;s proposal ofTreviso locality. He had said that he could not agree to anythingeast of Adige at present; he thought it wotdd be very dangerous to concentrate east of;Adige, for fear lest our troops might get mixedup in a debacle.the present and to avoid giving opportunity for any decisiveintervention of the Military Authorities.Mr. Long stated that he had learned from Lord Decies, whowas acting as censor in Ireland, that in the latter&apos;s opinion thesituation was serious and could not be ignored.The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for War to give a reply to Sir Bryan Mahonto the effect that no military action should be undertaken on his own initiative, but that he should give effect to anyrequest for militar3&apos; force put forward by the civil authorities.The War Cabinet decided To hold a Special Meeting on Tuesday, the 6th November, 1917,to consider the Irish question, at which Meeting  The Lord Lieutenant,The General Officer Commanding in Ireland,The Head of the Royal Irish Constabulary, andThe principal Heads of the Irish Office (Political and official)should be present.The Chief Secretary undertook to give effect to this decision.
The Director of Military Operations reported that General Fochhad telegraphed that the Germans were moving troops from Alsaceto the Trentino. Our information is that one German division hasmoved from Alsace to the Trentino, and another division is goingfrom Germany.With regard to the question of concentration, the Director of .Military Operations said that he considered it to be a first principlethat the place selected should be secure. The men arrived in trainsand must be concentrated before they can fight. - The place of concentration should never be within striking distance of the enemy.It was easy enough to move forward from the place of concentration,but very difficult to move back.The War Cabinet were of opinion that, as the French troops were due to arrive first, the risks in this connection were greaterfor the French than for ourselves, and therefore the first step mustbe to find out what the French were doing.The War Cabinet instructed The Director of Military Operations to ascertain what theFrench were doing in regard to the place of concentration.8. The Director of Military Operations reported that sir Douglas Haig had been instructed to be prepared to send fourmore divisions to Italy, if necessary. These troops, however, couldnot be there before the first week in December, if it was decided tosend them at aU, and if the French placed all routes at our disposal.Palestine. 9. With reference to War Cabinet 261, Minute 5, the Directorof Military Operations reported that General Allenby had carriedout his attack in accordance with the plans explained on theprevious day, had captured Beersheeba and was continuing hisadvance. The progress had been satisfactory, and water could nowbe obtained in the neighbourhood in which &quot; our troops were operating.Air Offensive. 10. The Director of Military Operations reported that fourHandley-Page machines had started on the night of the 30th/31stOctober for Mannheim ; bad weather had been encountered, three off the machines had returned with their bombs; one machine wasmissing.In this connection the question was raised as to whether theprice which we are paying for these raids is not too high. Theprevalent impression at the front appears to be that the War Cabinetwant raids at any price, regardless of weather.The Secretary of State for War said that he had told GeneralTrenchard that raids were not to be carried out unless the weather was suitable.Russia. u  The Director of Military Operations reported the receipt oftwo telegrams from General Barter, giving more encouragingaccounts of the state of the Russian army. He said that there were400,000 good troops who would be ready by January, and that thevolunteer movement; of which Professor Pares had given the firstintimation, was more promising.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a telegram from lord Reading saying that Count Horodysky reported that thesituation in Russia was worse. than hitherto, and that peace wouldprobably be made within two months, unless Japanese and american divisions were sent to pull the nation together. In the russian army there appeared to be about 2,000,000 reliable troops, composedof 500,000 Poles and 500,000 Cossacks and 1,000,000 Russians.Lord Reading concluded his telegram by saying that the RussianAmbassador in Washington was talking peace.Further british assistance toItaly.
With regard to outside assistance for Russia, attention was called to telegram No. 618 from Tokyo, dated the 20th October,reporting that the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs hadcategorically informed the Russian Ambassador that the question ofthe despatch of troops to Europe had been decided once and for all,and that the Government would not change its mind.With regard to the other alternative, namely, the employmentof American troops, it was pointed out that the Americans wouldhave more troops than they can transport across the Atlantic,and therefore any troops sent across the Pacific to Russia will be anet gain to the Allied forces.The War Cabinet decided that A message should be sent by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to Lord Reading in the sense that, while it was not for this country to indicate to the United States what theyshould do in the matter of strengthening the moral of theRussian army, at the same time, if the United StatesGovernment saw their way to send a force to Russia, HisMajesty&apos;s Government felt that the effect would be very good. Lord Reading should also be informed of GeneralBarteFs telegram, and told that this telegram confirmedinformation already received from other quarters in regardto the good prospect of the Volunteer movement in Russia.Mr. Balfour undertook to draft a message to Lord Reading inthis sense, and to submit it to the Prime Minister.East Africa.Proposed Inter-Allied supreme council and allied general Staff.1.2. The Director of Military Operations reported that GeneralNorthey&apos;s troops had occupied Liwale, Von Lettow&apos;s headquarters in East Africa. In view of the nature of the country it was stillpossible for the enemy to hold out.13. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a preliminary draft of a project prepared by the Director of Military Operations,at the request of the Prime Minister, setting forth the formation ofa proposed Inter-Allied General Staff and its relation to the Inter-Allied Supreme Council and the x\llied General Staff (Appendix HI).The Prime Minister stated that he had communicated this scheme toM. Paiuleve.Lord Derby said that the document, had been drawn up at very short notice, and that in the circumstances it would not representconsidered military opinion.   It was a basis for discussion only.It was suggested that the draft should indicate more clearly that. the Inter-Allied General Staff should remain in permanentservice, in contradistinction to the Inter-Allied Supreme Council,which would only meet occasionally.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary should circulate the scheme for their con-si deration.(6.) They would consider it as soon as M. Painleve&apos;s remarksare available.Submarines. 14. The First Sea Lord reported that the Vice-Admiral, east coast, states that the Special Service brigantine &quot;Dargle&quot; has arrived at Immingham and reports that she engaged an enemysvibmarine about 8 a.m. on the 31st October about 9 miles east ofWithernsea. The engagement lasted about ten minutes, at 1,500yards&apos; range. The submarine was on the surface. The followinghits were seen on the submarine: 3 with 12-pr. and 3 with 4-inch guns. The submarine sank by the stern, evidently vitally injured,and it is believed was destroyed with all hands.   The &quot; Dargle &quot;
was hit three times, both masts being damaged. One man waskilled and two seriously injured.Loss of an Austrian 15. The First Sea Lord reported that the Naval Attache statesDestroyer. that the Italian Ministry of Marine has reliable information that theAustrian destroyer &quot; Wildfang&quot; lias been sunk by striking an Italianmine.Bombing Raids. 16. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that thefollowing reports had been received from Dunkirk :  (a.) During an offensive patrol on the 31st October one hostilemachine was shot down out of control.(6.) A bombing raid was carried out on the 31st October onSparappelhoek Aerodrome, 7 65, 4 50, and 33 16-lb.bombs being dropped on the objective at 1T1 p.m.Visibility was fairly good, but targets partially obscuredby clouds, making results difficult to observe. Inaddition, 8 -16-lb. bombs were dropped on a large shedsouth of main road, and about 3 miles east of Beorst.All machines returned safely.Air Raids. 17. General Ashmore reported that a very determined attack had been made upon London the previous night, by a large numberof hostile aircraft, which approached in relays. About 30 hostileaeroplanes in all appeared to have crossed the coast-line. The first four groups, which had arrived up to midnight, had been turnedback by our defences. Two or three machines, it was believed, had reached London, one of which was for some time manoeuvring overthe metropolis above the clouds, and dropped bombs on Wandsworthand elsewhere. Eighteen of our own aeroplanes had been in the air the whole time that the raid was in progress, and our trackingmachines had got into touch with the enemy craft. So far as heknewT, no hostile craft had been brought down. The enemyaeroplanes had operated generally at an altitude of about 11,000 feet.The Chief Commissioner of Police said that, according toreports to hand, 35 explosive bombs and 10 incendiary bombs hadbeen dropped on London, and the casualties were 7 killed and 17injured. Considerably more bombs had been dropped in thecountry, viz.. at Dover, Ramsgate, Ashford, &amp;c.The First Sea Lord reported that a seaplane base had been hitthe previous night at Dover, but he understood that no appreciabledamage had been caused.Questions in 18. Lord Curzon asked for the instructions of the War CabinetParliament. as to the reply he should give to a question which Lord Montagu ofBeaulieu had given notice of his intention to ask in the House ofLords regarding the adequacy of the measures taken by the Govern-ment to ensure the security of the London area against hostile air raids. Lord Curzon said that the courses which, in his opinion,appeared to bo open to him, were (a.) To ask Lord Montagu privately to withdraw his question,in the public interest.(6.) To reply to the question in such terms as the War cabinet might consider suitable.The objection to the first alternative, it was suggested, was thatthis might generate the belief that the Government was.anxious to conceal deficiencies or to shelve the question, and that it would cropup again shortly in a more acute form.
Air raids :Provision of Coverin London.19. With reference to War Cabinet 250, Minute 3, the Secretaryof State for Home affairs represented that Tube stations enteredlargely into the arrangements made for the provision of cover forthe inhabitants of the Metropolis. These shelters arc ordinarilyclosed at about 1 a.m., when traffic on the tube railways is suspendedfor the night. He proposed to interview the heads of the Tuberailways in order to see if arrangements could not be made to havethe Tube stations open after 1 a.m. when raids are in progress.This would entail no extra demands upon the Tube railways&apos; staffs,as the necessary provision would be made by the Chief Commis-sioner of Police by means of constables, both regular and special.The War Cabinet authorised-The Home Secretary to take such action as might be necessaryto ensure that Tube stations should be open for the accommodation of the general public, after the ordinarytraffic had been suspended, when hostile air raids were inprogress.&apos;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 1, 1917.In regard to the second alternative, it was pointed out that this procedure might give rise to a prolonged debate which could haveno satisfactory issue, in view of the fact that a complete answer was not advisable in the pixblic interest. It was obviously highly understandable that detailed information should be publicly given as tothe measures which had been adopted for the security of the london area against hostile air raids.The War Cabinet decided that Lord Curzon should ask Lord Montagu to withdraw his question, since, even if it was put, he wordd be unable to answer it without revealing valuable information to theenemy.
APPENDIX I.G.T.-2392. &quot;The Obder of the British Empire.Report by the Earl of Craioford and Balcarres.IN accordance with, the War Cabinet 251, Minute 16, I beg leave to state that Ihave examined the documents relating to the Order of the British Empire, and I haveconferred with the Committee, which reported on the 28th September (see G.T.-2290).Many complex and delicate problems arise on which I shall send a subsequentreport, but I desire to invite an early decision on one or two matters of urgency.In order to have names ready for the coming New Year&apos;s Honours&apos; list, it isnecessary to establish in a general manner the total number of decorations to be conferred, the percentages to be allotted to various services, and the number of gazettesinto which this total will be divided.Until these decisions are taken it is impossible for Departments to make their proposals. It is specially important for the Foreign Office, India Office, War Office,and Colonial Office to receive their instructions forthwith in order to allow adequatetime to communicate with their Departments abroad. Even for public Departments athome the time available is short.I find there is general agreement among those who have given close and protractedattention to this subject, that there should be five classes, and that the following broadsubdivision should be made : 	I.	11.               III.               IV. 1                   1			V.For United Kingdom ,, Dominions   . . ,, Crown Colonies ,, India ,, Allies&apos;&apos;	100 25 8 12 50	300 &apos; 75 25 35 150	1.200 300 100 150 600	4,000 1,000 330 500 2,000	6,000 1,500 500 750 3,000These figures exclude a sixth section of medallists. The number therefore islarge--upwards of 22,000 but modest in comparison with the numbers conferred byContinental countries.These figures can, of course, be reduced, or they can be spread over a longseries of gazettes.   For the moment, however, I submit to the Cabinet 1. That Departments should be authorised to&apos;proceed on the assumption that thetotal should be divided among four half-yearly gazettes, beginning1st January, 1918. One-fourth, therefore, of the total would be availablefor the coming list.2. That Departments which cannot recommend their quota should be entitled tocarry forward the balance of their allotment.3. That the War Office and Admiralty be authorised to make such distribution oftheir respective allotments between civilians and combatants as they may think advisable.The allocation of numbers between the various Departments at home is now being examined. As regards sanction to those Departments which have to communicateabroad, the matter is so urgent that, should, the Cabinet agree to the foregoingproposals, I suggest that authority to act should be conveyed direct to the fourDepartments concerned.(Signed) CRAWFORD AND BALCARRES.7, Audley Square,October 25, 1917.
APPENDIX II.G.T.-2429.--COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE DONE BY AlR RAIDS.Memorandum by Mr. Stanley Baldwin, M.P.THE War Cabinet decided oa the 4th October (War Cabinet 245) that a completeindemnity for the destruction of property caused directly by an enemy air raid up to amaximum of 500Z. should be payable by the Government without insurance, butanything over that figure must be covered by insurance. The Treasury were instructedto produce a scheme in detail to give effect to this decision, and to publish the same assoon as possible.The attached scheme,* which has been prepared by the Treasury and the Board of-Trade with their advisers, gives effect to this decision. Owners of property notexceeding 500Z. get full cover against all the risks covered by the Government policy.Owners of property exceeding 500Z. are given in effect the benefit of a free policy for5001. if they require it, provided that all value in excess of 500Z. is insured under theGovernment Insurance Scheme.As the free policy is a free gift, it is not unreasonable to require that the remainder of the property be insured with the Government, and it would in practice be extremelydifficult to work the scheme if policies issued outside the Government scheme had tobe taken into account.The scheme is ready to put into operation at once, and the&quot; question for the WarCabinet to decide is from what date it should take effect. The Prime Ministers speech to the deputation at which something of this kind was promised was made on the13th July. The objections to going hack as far as that are that it would be difficultnow to get at the facts, and the damage has probably to a large extent been made good.From the point of view of mere administration, 1st October would be a good date, forthe new office would be able to start fairly clear. But if 1st September is chosen, itwould include the moonlight raids.It is suggested that the scheme might be announced by means of a friendlyquestion in the House of Commons.(Signed)      STANLEY BALDWIN.Treasurij, S.W.,October 29, 1917.House of Commons.Mr........................., To ask the Prime Minister whether he is in a position tomake any statement as to the compensation to be given for damage to property causedby air raids.Mr. Bonar Law. A scheme has been prepared for giving owners of propertynot exceeding 500Z. in value compensation for damage done by air raids andbombardment without payment of any premium. Owners of property exceeding500Z. in value would be compensated up to 500Z. without payment of premium,provided that all value in excess of 500Z. is insured under the GovernmentInsurance Scheme.The new scheme will take place as from..................   It will be administered by a Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Thomas Elliott, and will be worked inclose connection with the Government Insurance Scheme, which is under thesuperintendence of the Board of Trade.I am circulating a copy of the scheme with the votes.* Draft attached.[1365-252] &apos; D
Scheme of Compensation for Damage by Aircraft and Bombardment.1. (a.) Owners of property in the United Kingdom of an aggregate value notexceeding 500Z. will be compensated by the Government in respect of damage or destruction of any of such property by the perils coverable by the GovernmentAircraft and Bombardment Insurance Policy, whether the property be insured underthe Government Insurance Scheme or not so insured at the time of its damage or destruction.(o.) Owners of insurable property in the United Kingdom of an aggregate valueexceeding 500Z. will be compensated up to that amount without payment of premium,provided that all value in excess of 500L is insured under the Government InsuranceScheme.2. If the property of an owner is not fully insured under the GovernmentInsurance Scheme, any claim, under this Compensation Scheme, as well as under any government Policy, will be subject to average in conformity with the terms andconditions of the Government Aircraft Insurance Policy and the Note thereto.3. The total amount payable by the Government in respect of a claim will be discharged under any Government Policy of Insurance in force at the time of the damage up to the amount payable under such policy, and the balance, if any, will be discharged under this Compensation Scheme.4. Owners of property may at their option insure the whole value of their property under the Government Aircraft Insurance Scheme, but not by means of post Office Certificates, which will not be issited in future.5. Compensation will be limited to the actual damage done, having regard to thecondition and value of the property at the time of the damage, and will be devoted to making good the damage, subject to any conditions and exceptions which the Air RaidCompensation Committee may prescribe.6. (a.) In the case of uninsured property, immediate notice must, when damageoccurs, be given to the Air Raid Compensation Committee at Palmerston House, OldBroad Street, London, E.C. 2, or to their agents.(b.) In the case of damage to property insured under the Government AircraftInsurance Scheme, immediate notice must be given to the office through which theinsurance was effected.7. No compensation will be paid (a.) In respect of any loss recoverable under any insurance.(b.) For money, securities, stamps, documents, manuscripts, or books of account,(c.) For consequential loss or theft.(d.) For any expenses incurred in preparing or supporting a claim on the Govern-ment.(e.) For fees in connection with reinstatement of damaged property.(/.) In the event of a claim being fraudulent in any respect.S. In no circumstance will a refund of premium be made in respect of any insur-ance that may have been effected with the Government.9. This scheme will take effect as from......................., 1917.APPENDIX III.W.P. 63.     , &apos;   _Supreme Inter-Allied Council.Suggestions as to the Functions of the Military Staff of the proposed Supreme Inter-Allied Council, and as to their Relations with the Allied General Staff.Preliminary Draft by the Director of militar-y Operations.1. The formation of the Supreme Inter-Allied Council will not affect theresponsibility of each Chief of the General Staff to his own Government&apos; for theconduct of the operations of the armies of his own nation.
2. Each of the Allies will appoint a permanent military representative to assistat the Allied Supreme Council. This representative will not he a memher of theCouncil, and his function will be advisory only.3. The military representative of each nation will obtain from the Chief of theGeneral Staff of his country all information as to its military resources, and, inconjunction with the other Allied military representatives, will co-ordinate that information for the use of the Supreme Inter-Allied Council.4. The military representative of each nation will similarly receive from theChief of the General Staff of his country proposals for future plans of operations, andthe military representatives in consultation will then he charged with presenting tothe Supreme Council a co-ordinate statement of those plans, together with proposalsfor the combined action of the Allies. Should the plans received from the Chiefs ofGeneral Staffs not be, in the opinion of the military representatives, the best for ensuring such combined action it will be within their functions to suggest other proposals.5. The proposals for combined military action when approved by the supreme council will be sent by each military representative to the Chief of the General Staffof his country, who will advise his Government upon them and will be responsible fortheir execution, as far as concerns the Armies of his country, when they have beenapproved by his Government.6. Each military representative will be supplied with a Staff to enable him to carryout his duties as defined above, but the General Staff of each country will remain responsible for the preparation and execution of plans in detail, and, in addition totheir present duties, will be charged with supplying to the military representative oftheir country such information as he may require.The above proposals deal only with the military side of the Supreme allied council. Similar machinery will probably be required to enable the Supreme Councilto deal with naval questions, and perhaps also with diplomatic, economic, and shippingquestions.November 1, 1917.
