2. In connection with a French offensive on the Western Jiront,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that he had receiveda personal letter from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to the effectthat the latter had been unable to see General Petain, who had beenin attendance on the King of Italy General Anthoine had, however,seen General Petain on the matter, and Sir D. Haig reported that hewas satisfied that active preparations were now being pressed forward by General Petain.The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that at the paris conference on the 26th/27th May he had been convinced that theFrench did not intend to attack.The War Cabinet felt that the coincidence of the delays on thepart both of the French and the Italians to attack was unsatisfactory and difficult to explain.Persia. 3. The Chief of- the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadbeen receiving telegrams from the Military Attache in Russiarelative to money not being forthcoming for Persia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to enquire intothe matter, and to inform the War Office.The Italian Front:Withdrawal of guns :Their Disposal.Anti-Aircraft Guusfor Eussia.4. With reference to War Cabinet 242, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that the despatch of the Britishbatteries had been delayed. They should have gone on the29th ultimo, but were starting to-day. He added that the wholeof the French batteries were being withdrawn.General Robertson stated that he had received a report fromGeneral Dehne-Radcliffe, which would be circulated to the Cabinet,but it contained no new military factor which could satisfactorilyexplain the failure of the Italians to carry out their original intentionto attack.5. The War Cabinet approved the action of the Secretary ofState for War in refusing an application from General Dessino onbehalf of the Russian Government for anti-aircraft guns for theprotection of Petrograd.Transport ofEussian Troops.6. The Secretary of State for War stated that the French were pressing for shipping to take the Russian troops now in Franceback to Russia. He pointed out that it was more desirable that theRussian population in Great Britain who have refused service inthe British Army should have priority if any sea transport was available.The War Cabinet authorised  The Secretary of State for War to refuse the request putforward by the French Government.Air raids : 7. The First Sea Lord reported that three enemy seaplanesMudros. reconnoitred Mudros on the 30th September.   Two were shot downinto the sea by our machines, and the third was damaged.   Onewounded enemy pilot was taken prisoner.The Western Front. 1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that therehad been hard fighting on the Western Front. The enemy had made six attacks, which had all been repelled.
Dunkirk.3        . WC 2438. The First Sea Lord reported that a Handley-Page aeroplaneleft Mudros on the 30th September to attack Haidar Pasha (about1 mile south of Scutari), and had not since been heard of.9. The First Sea Lord stated that reports had been receivedfrom Dunkirk as follows :  (a.) One enemy two-seater shot down by R.N.A.S. patrols andobserved to crash into the sen, and two others drivendown out of control.(6.) During night of 30th-lst bombs were dropped on St. DenisWestrem aerodrome, falling among the hangars and setting fire to one on the south side, which blazed welland fire was spreading. This fire was visible 30 miles away. In addition, bombs were dropped on Zeebruggelock-gates.(c.) A bombing raid on St. Denis Westrem was carried out onthe 1st instant, several direct hits being observed, andtwo sheds seen on fire in south-east corner of aerodrome.An observer states that the large shed ou the south sideof the aerodrome referred to in (b) appears to be com-pletely gutted. All machines returned safely. Totalweight of bombs dropped was 4-g- tons.Naval Losses. 10. The First Sea Lord reported that a telegram had just beenreceived that HALS. &quot; Drake &quot; had been torpedoed by an enemy submarine in the vicinity of Rathlin Island whilst in charge of a convoy.Air raids .i 1. The War Cabinet had before them a summary of information in regard to the air raid on the previous night, received up to11 a.m., issued bv the General Staff, Home Forces (Air Raid CircularNo. 147).It was pointed out that the public, and in particular the poorestclasses, whose tenements are often of the flimsiest description, weretending to give way to panic. This was to a considerable extent-due to the publication in the press of detailed descriptions andphotographs of casualties caused and damage done.The War Cabinet agreed that the Prime Minister should see theeditors of the principal newspapers, in order to restrain them from publishing detailed descriptive accounts and pictures of the effects of the raids, aud to explain the reasons for this restriction. It wrasgenerally agreed that it was very important to lay stress on theinsignificant number of casualties from air raids compared withthose caused bv street and other accidents.Provision of Anti-Aircraft Guns :The Barrage.12. It was brought to the notice of the War Cabinet that defence by barrage fire cduld not be continued indefinitely, owingto the great, wear and tear of guns and the heavy expenditure ofammunition.It had been necessary last night to reduce the volume ofbarrage fire, and it was reasonable to infer that this was the reason why more enemy aeroplanes had been able to penetrate the defencesthan had hitherto been the case.It was further pointed out that already some guns were wornout and had had to be replaced, and that if the raids continued onthe scale of the last week it was only a matter of a few months before the gun defences of the metropolis ceased to exist.The Minister of Munitions reported that he had undertaken, onbehalf of his Department, at the Meeting of General Smuts&apos;s Air248] B 2
Raids Committee, held the previous afternoon, to repair 20 3-inch20-cwt. guns a month.Attention was also drawn to the large number of unexplodedshells falling in different parts of the metropolis, which, it wassuggested, not only caused great damage but was an important factor in alarming the populace. On the other hand, the expertspresent were agreed that considerable numbers of hostile aeroplaneshad been turned back by the barrage, or compelled to operate at a very high altitude, and it was generally admitted that to withdraw the barrage would cause great despondency.In view of the fact that the situation in regard to submarineswas improving and the aerial situation deteriorating, the WarCabinet decided that Four guns immediately available for mounting in merchant ships should be diverted to the London defences, and thatthe output of 3-inch guns for the next month should beplaced at the disposal of the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Defences.The Offensive.The United Statesof America:Aircraft Output.13. General Smuts reported that the Air Raids Committee(War Cabinet 242 a, Minutes 1 and 2) had met the previous afternoon and that the details of offensive air operations in contem-contemplation were being worked out with the least possible delay. he stated that General Trenchard was now on his way to London andwould be available for consultation in the course of the next few hours. Arrangements had been made for one squadron of long-rangebombing machines to proceed to Luxeuil.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to report tothe War Cabinet with regard to the question, of detachingsuitable machines from the Western Front for long-rangebombing operations as soon as he had seen GeneralTrenchard.The First Sea Lord reported that similarly arrangements hadbeen made to send eight naval Hanclley-Page machines to the sameplace.It was pointed out that the withdrawal, of more long-rangemachines from the Western Front, where they are employed on the systematic bombing of enemy aerodromes, would tend to increasethe risk to London.14. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat he had received a telegram from Lord Northcliffe stating thatfor the present the United States were not in a position to sendmany aeroplanes to the Western Front, but they were training largenumbers of pilots. Lord Northcliffe further said that the productionof the &quot; Liberty &quot; aeroplane was a wonderful feat of engineering.Output of aircraft the GoverningFactor.15. In reply, to a question, Sir William Weir stated that skilled labour was the main - need for the increased output of aeroplanes.This labour could only be obtained at the expense of other services,e.g., the output of anti-aircraft guns and various naval services. he stated that a paper had been circulated in which he had analysedthe uses made by this country of the skilled labour available.The Minister of Munitions said that the order of priority, as he understood it, was (a.) Shipbuilding to the utmost capacity of the plate-rollingmills.(b.) Aeroplanes.His Ministry had at once to find an extra .1,800 highly skilled men,and a similar number would be required a few months later if the
WG 243air programme was to be fulfilled. He reminded the War Cabinetthat any increases in other services, for instance, airships orballoons, would be at the expense of aeroplanes ; nevertheless, avery large aeroplane programme had been arranged for, and he was inclined to think that the machines would be supplied in advanceof the concomitant services, such as aerodromes, sheds, store-houses, &amp;c, and he urged that the responsible Departments should press on the provision of these services.Attention was drawn to a paper (G.T.-2079) which had been recently circulated, indicating that the Germans contemplated avast increase in the number of their aircraft.Lord Cowdray pointed out that we had at present 6,000 aero-planes &quot; in being,&quot; and 1,500 naval planes. To make 1,000 planesa month complete with their spares required 120,000 hands, skilled and unskilled. The life of a fighting aeroplane at the Front wassix weeks, which meant that there was a wastage of 66 per cent, per month.General Smuts said that the whole question was beingexhaustively examined by his Committee, which would report tothe War Cabinet in due course.1(5. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum byMr. Barnes (Paper G.T.-2130) on the housing position in Barrow(War Cabinet 232, Minute 16).It was stated that the Ministry of Munitions were proceeding with the erection of 1,000 houses, 500 of them of a senh-pernianentcharacter. It was hoped that 500 of the 1,000 houses would becompleted by March next. In view of the shortage of material andof labour this was considered the maximum number of housespossible at present. In addition, steps were being taken to billet2,000 single munition workers in Barrow and the neighbourhood.There was no power under the Defence of the Realm regulations to billet the families of munition workers.Mr. Barnes was requested to arrange to communicate the above to the press.Coal for Italy. 17. With   reference   to   War Cabinet 237,   Minute 10 and appendix II, the War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Ministry of Shipping on the Supply of Coal to Italy from theUnited Kingdom (Paper G.T.-2160), suggesting that the Italiansshould make an appeal to America for tonnage to help the formerout Of their difficulties. To save tonnage, the proposal should be onthe basis of America sending what ships she could on a triangularvoyage, America-United Kingdom, United Kingdom-Italy, GreatBritain putting in an extra collier to Italy for every cargo delivered in the United Kingdom under the arrangement.The First Sea Lord pointed out that the Italian Governmenthad refused to -let us have the destroyers for which we had asked(War Cabinet 237, Minute 10). The Italian Admiralty insisted onhaving twice as many destroyers in the Adriatic as the Austrianshad there. This, in Admiral Jellicoes view, was quite unreasonable,but he thought there were possibly political reasons for it. Sincethe dispatch of our&apos; telegram to Italy on the question of destroyers,the military situation had changed. Any destroyers taken for theconveying of troops would necessarily interfere with other convoyarrangements through the Mediterranean. This would seriously affect the proposal to divert shipping from the Cape route tothe Mediterranean route. Further, we had been trying to persuade the Italians to follow the direct route from Gibraltar to Genoa,instead of the coast route, which was unconscionably long . andinvolved a great waste of tonnage.   The Admiralty had informedInadequacy ofHousingAccommodation.
the Italians that we proposed to send British ships, Allied ships under our control, and Allied ships chartered to the Italians by the direct route.Sir L. Ohiozza Money pointed out, with reference to the proposalto appeal to America for tonnage, that the U.S.A. Shipping board were diverting live commandeered new ships for the purpose of opening up new trade between North and South America as trade from which we had withdrawn ships. In view of the great shortageof tonnage it would be impossible to make up 700,000 tons to Italy,except at the expense of other urgent demands on our ships.Mr. Salter said that no direct and mathematical relation couldbe established between the provision of 11 destroyers and the extraquantity of coal supplied to Italy. The provision of the destroyerswould only indirectly affect the situation by strengthening theMediterranean escort forces. If the Admiralty (with or withoutthe destroyers) could convoy regularly through the Mediterranean,Indian liners, which now go round the Cape, could go by theMediterranean route. They could take coal to Port Said, and soenable tramp steamers now destined for Port Said to go to Italywith coal instead.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the positionin Italy was undoubtedly serious. Sir Rennell Rodd had repeatedlymentioned the matter, and had pointed out that while a part ofItaly could no doubt draw on the forests, it was impossible to poolthe forest supply, owing to inadequate means of communication. Itwa3 feared that unless there was an increased supply of coal duringthe forthcoming winter there would be serious public disorder,especially in Lombardy.The War Cabinet decided To defer the consideration of the proposals contained in theMemorandum by the Ministry of Shipping until later inthe week, when it was hoped that the Shipping Controllermight be present, and to ask the Shipping Controller, inconsultation with the Admiralty, to report on the whole situation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 2, 1917.o
