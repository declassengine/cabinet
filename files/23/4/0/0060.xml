THE Director of Military Operations reported that in theCambrai theatre the Germans had, at the commencement of ouroffensive, 3 divisions. Since the commencement of the offensivethey had brought up 10 further divisions. Of these 13 divisions 6had been withdrawn, leaving 7 in the line. Sir Douglas Haig hadengaged 10 of his divisions, and had withdrawn 2, leaving 8 in theline.   Our divisions were stronger than the German divisions.The Invasion of 2. TheDirector of Military Operations intimated that there wereItaly- indications of an enemy attack on the River Piave at the pointimmediately south of the sector occupied by our troops. The enemy had thrown eleven bridges across different arms of the river, whichin that neighbourhood form a number of islands. All enemy troopsin the threatened area-were Austrians.[1365-286]B
Palestine. 3. The Director of Military Operations reported the receipt of afull summary of the situation to date from General Allenby.   Thelatter estimated the Turkish forces opposed to him on the 31stOctober at 41,000 rifles and 300 guns.   He estimated his subsequentcaptures at 10,000 prisoners and SO guns, the number of enemykilled and wounded being probably about 15,000.   In addition tothese he had captured 20 aeroplanes and a great quantity of ammu-nition and stores.   No enemy aircraft had been seen in the air formany days.   His own position he estimated as follows : On 31stOctober he had 96,000 effectives, and he still had 7S,000.   the brunt of the work had fallen upon two mounted divisions and upontwo infantry divisions, viz., the 52nd and the 75th.   The latter tworequired a rest, and were now being relieved by other divisions.These were in excelleut order, with the exception of a division which had recently arrived from Salonica, in which malaria was somewhat prevalent.   The railway communication with Egypt nowextended to a point 10 miles north of Gaza, and was being pushedon.   Supplies were being landed at the mouth of the Wadi Sukeir.Among the captures from the enemy were six locomotives anda number of waggons.   The main remaining enemy force was concentrated in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and, owing to his great superiority in numbers, material, and aeroplanes, general allenby would shortly be in a position to deal with them.   Shouldhe prove successful in capturing Jerusalem he would be able to take up a strong line somewhat to the north of it, between the Jordan andthe sea, which would have the advantage of having a lateral railwayin its rear, viz., the Jaffa-Jerusalem Railway, which could be easilyand quickly repaired.Questioned regarding enemy reinforcements, General Mauricestated that it was estimated that there were in the vicinity of Aleppoone weak German division and two weak Turkish divisions. one other weak German division was believed to be now moving toNabbus. The General Staff calculated that it would take fromfourteen to sixteen days to move a Turkish division from Aleppo toNablus, from which point they would have to march south. It was stated that the Turkish forces lately at Hebron had retired onJerusalem. Arrangements had been made for Arab co-operation inblowing up portions of the Hedjaz Railway east of the Jordan, andalso between Aleppo and Damascus. Nearly ,all the tribes were co-operating, but there appeared little prospect of the Drusescoming to our assistance until the British advance had reached a more northerly point.It was pointed out that, judging by experience in other theatres of the war, General Allenby&apos;s superiority in the air should prove a valuable adjunct in embarrassing a retiring Turkish army byengaging them from a low elevation whilst they were on the move on their coastal line.General Maurice stated that he gathered that General Allenbyhad been making full use of this arm, but that the highlands ofJudea and Samaria were of such a nature that it was extremelydifficult to find landing grounds. General Allenby had all theaeroplanes he had asked for, and no further demands had been made.East Africa. . 4. The Director of Military Operations drew the attention ofthe War Cabinet to the published communique in that morning&apos;press ; since then a further success had been reported, and the onlyenemy forces now in the field in this theatre were 2,000 men undervon Lettow, now on the Portuguese frontier.Shipping Losses. 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that there had beenheavy losses at sea by the action of enemy submarines betweennoon 27th and noon 28th instant. 20,932 British and 12,055 Alliedtons of shipping had been sunk ; and 10,S8o tons of British shippingdamaged by torpedo, but it was hoped the latter could be repaired.
Russia. 7. The War Cabinet had before them a number of telegrams from Petrograd and Jassy, including the following  No. 1874 from Sir G. Buchanan, dated 26th November.I Q 7 oj O i O     , ,       ,, ,, ,j ,, ,,&quot;SSI   ,,     ,, ,, 27th706     ,,   Sir G. Barclay,        .,   26th       ,,710 c-*7th,,   711.     ,,    the   military   attache  at  Jassy,   dated   27thNovember.Lord Robert Cecil stated that, apart from the large issues ofpolicy raised in these telegrams, there were two minor questionswhich could be separately dealt with. The first was the demandput forward by IVI. Trotski for the release of Chichirin and Petroff,who are interned in this country, and the virtual threat of reprisals against British subjects in Russia should the two agitators not be released. To release them at Trotski&apos;s bidding &quot;would greatly add to his prestige, and would be tantamount to a recognition of hisGovernment. The second question was the complaint made bySir G. Buchanan that General Barter had put the Ambassador in avery embarrassing position by the threat of &quot; serious consequences,&quot;which accompanied the note to the Commander-in-Chief protesting against Russia&apos;s infraction of the 1914 Agreement.The Director of Military Operations said that probably GeneralBarter was influenced by the fact that M. Clemenceau had wired tothe Head of the French Mission telling him to take energetic action,and adding that the Commander-in-Chief would be supported in any action he took against Petrograd.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) No notice should be taken of M. Trotski&apos;s request to release Chichirin and Petroff.(b.) The Secretary of State for War should enquire into the complaint against General Barter, and that a suitabletelegram should be sent to Sir G. Buchanan.The War Cabinet next considered the general Russian situation,especially as set forth in telegrams Nos. 1878 and 1881 fromPetrograd and No. 711 from Jassy. M. Trotski had issued to theMilitary Attaches of Allied Powers, on 27th November, a note statingthat he and his supporters were endeavouring to bring about ageneral and not a separate armistice, but that they might be driven to a separate armistice by the Allies if they refused to negotiate. Ifthe Allied Governments would not recognise the Bolsheviks thelatter would appeal to the peoples as against their Governments.Sir G. Buchanan urged that a reply should be issued immediately to this &quot; insolent communication,&quot; pointing out that Trotski&apos;proposal for a general armistice reached the British Embassynineteen hours after the Commander-in-Chief had opened pourparlerswith the enemy, and that the Allies were determined to continue thewar until a permanent peace had been obtained. Sir G. Buchananfurther urged the Government that, as the situation was nowdesperate, it was advisable to set Russia free from her agreementwith the Allies, so that she could act as she chose, and decide topurchase peace on Germany&apos;s terms or fight on with the Allies.The policy of the Bolsheviks was to divide Russia and Britain, andso pave the way for what would virtually be a German protectorateover the former. The course he recommended, if adopted, wouldmake it impossible for the Bolsheviks to reproach the Allies withNaval Co-operation 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot;Lizard&quot;in Palestine. nac[ firex[ at a party of Turks from the shore to the north of Jaffa.
driving Russian soldiers to slaughter for their Imperialist aims. Inthe telegram sent to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, themilitary attache at Jassy proposed that, if it were found that Kaledinwas well-disposed to the Allies, a French and British Mission, fullyaccredited, should be sent to his headquarters; that financial support up to IO,000,OOOZ. should he guaranteed to Kaleclin ; and,generally, that the British Mission should have full power to actwithout waiting instructions from England.The War Cabinet were informed that a message had been stopped by the Press Bureau from Trotski, addressed to the ambassadors of Norway, Holland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and denmark, asking that pressure should be brought to bear by theSocialist and working-class organisations in these countries in favourof peace.Lord Robert Cecil said it was important that the Cabinet should arrive at a decision at the earliest possible moment on the questions raised in the above telegrams. Kaleclin was in command of theresources of Russia, and if he and his Cossacks could be unitedagainst the Germans, supplies would thereby be prevented from reaching the enemy. There was no evidence to show that theBolsheviks had anything like general support throughout Russia.There was reason for thinking that the peasants were against theBolsheviks. Kaledin had wdth him Alexieff, and possibly Savinkoffand Rodzianko. The one man with an organised force was Kaledin,and, as Chief of the Cossacks, he had great prestige. He (lord robert Cecil) would send General Ballard to Kaledin, and, if he found Kaleclin genuinely in favour of the Allies, General Ballardshould be authorised to take what steps he deemed wise, and to incur expenditure up to 10,000,000Z.Some members of the War Cabinet were impressed with theobjections to the policy of entering into active co-operationwith Kaledin without further information. Steps had beentaken to obtain such information, but it had not yet beenreceived. Little was definitely known of Kaledin&apos;s personality, andthere were signs that the Cossacks were not prepared to fight. Thescheme, on General BallarcTs admission, was not one which couldbe regarded as hopeful, and its only result might be to drive theRussian Government definitely into the arms of G/ermany. If wewaited for a short time we should learn the terms offered byGermany, and these might open the eyes of the Russian people to what a German peace really meant.Alternative courses open were to follow Sir G. Buchanan&apos;advice or to wait a little longer in the hope that the situation would subsequently become clearer. In any case, the subject was onewhich should be referred to the conference now meeting in Paris.Attention was called to the position of the Roumanian army,and some members thought there was less objection to securing thesupport of Kaleclin for the Roumanian Army than for an openexpedition against the Bolsheviks. Against the policy of drift, itwas urged that for the past eight months wre had sedulouslyrefrained from intervening in the policy of the Russian Govern-ment, and we were now confronted with the fact that the russians were negotiating with the German Government. It had also to beremembered that Kaleclin had no information as to what were our views on the Russian situation.It was generally agreed that, if Kaledin were approached, twoMissions would not be required. General Ballard and a french representative should suffice.The War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send a message to Paris calling the attention of the PrimeMinister, Mr. Balfour,. and Lord Milner to the telegramsreferred to above, and should add that the members ofthe War Cabinet in London were divided in opinion as
to the immediate steps to be taken, some being in favourof authorising General Ballard to proceed on the lines indicated &quot;by him, others being in favour of waiting until further information was received.8. Sir Edward Carson called attention to a number of wirelessmessages from Russia-chiefly Bolshevik propaganda which had been  received by the Press Bureau, the publication of which he hadtemporarily stopped. He read examples of the messages, and alsothe following extract from a letter which had been received fromSir Frank Swettenham : &quot; The whole question of censoring or stopping such press- messages as are now coming to this office in regard to Russianaffairs is so full of difficulty that there appears to be only one way to deal with it, and that is to authorise us to pass, stop,or censor all such messages at our discretion, without regardto existing instructions that cablegrams dealing with foreignaffairs are to be passed to the addressees uncensored. Ifthis is done, we think it would be necessary to make some public announcement on the subject, though what constitutes&apos; foreign affairs&apos; in this connection is almost impossible todetermine. The alternative to this course is to pass everythingof the kind which comes from a press correspondent and cannot be dealt with on grounds other than those of foreignaffairs.&quot;Sir Edward Carson explained that some of the messages wereappeals to the people as against their Governments, and were inmany respects of a violent character. He had discussed thequestion with Mr. Balfour and Lord Milner before their departurefor Paris, and they were against publication.Lord Robert Cecil said that in the autumn of 1915 he had obtained authority to remove the censorship on Foreign Officematters, with certain exceptions, such as, e.g., a telegram going through this country for a foreign country. In his view the policy had justified itself, and it was better to throw the onus on to thepress and let them risk prosecution under the Defence of the RealmAct. He would allow the publication of these propagandistmessages, for, if withheld now, they would leak out later and theGovernment would be blamed for suppressing them.Against this view it was urged that the messages were propa-ganda from a Government which was not recognised by us or theAllies. A further reason for stopping publication was the Con-ference now meeting at Paris.It was reported that complaints had been received from someof the newspapers that they were only allowed to see mutilated copiesof some of their telegrams.The War Cabinet decided that For the present the messages above referred to should not bepublished, and that the Press Bureau should be allowed toshow the messages to the newspapers to which they wereaddressed, at their discretion.86]C
Supreme WarCouncil:Relations betweenArmy Council andBritish PermanentMilitaryRepresentative.9. With reference to War Cabinet 276, Minute 3, and paper.P. 67, the latter being a record of the proceedings of a Meetingof the Army Council held on the 19th November, 1917, relative tothe relations between the Army Council and the British permanent military Representative, the War Cabinet directed The Secretary to inform the Army Council that the War cabinet had taken note of the Minute in question of the ArmyCouncil and of their desire to co-operate cordially in thedevelopment of the work of the Supreme War Council witha view to better co-ordination of effort in the conduct of thewar, and that the War Cabinet feels assured that, with this connection-operation, the new machinery can be made to worksuccessfully in spite of the difficulties referred to by theArmy Council.Co-ordination 10. With reference to War Cabinet 285, Minute 13, Mr. BarnesCommittee for informed the War Cabinet that a meeting had been held on theLabour Disputes. previous evening in accordance with the War Cabinet decision, atwhich Sir Auckland Geddes5 proposal had been thoroughly discussed,and that, although it was admitted that theoretically it might be abetter scheme, the Committee did not consider that it would be practical in its working. He added that many of the trades werenot organised sufficiently to carry out the scheme on the lines proposed by the Minister of National Service, and that the committee felt that for all practical purposes the scheme as set out in paper g.T.-2772 was the only one that they could recommend for adoption.Certain minor amendments had been made in the scheme as con-si dered by the War Cabinet on the 28th November, and the Committeewished Sir Auckland Geddes to be added to the Co-ordinating Com-mittee, and that Mr. Guy Calthrop should take the place of SirRichard Redmayne. The Committee further proposed to arm them-selveswith power to appoint an adviser from each trade to advise theCo-ordinating Committee as might be-requisite during the preliminariesof any dispute. Mr. Barnes pointed out that certain departments had been added, with a view to representatives being appointedfrom them to sit on the Consultative Committee, and that the point for the Co-ordinating Committee to aim at was to obtain repre-sentatives who should not act strictly as representatives of theDepartments to which they belouged, but that they should give theCommittee the benefit of their knowledge of the conditions underdiscussion, acting in a judicial capacity rather than as membersrepresentative of Departments advocating their own case.Sir Auckland Geddes expressed the view that to have anofficial so acting would put the latter in an impossible position, ashe would be sitting in judgment on the Head of his own Depart-ment, from whom he must naturally receive his instructions.As against this, Mr. Barnes strongly pointed out that it was highly desirable for the efficient . working of the Co-co-ordinating committee that the actual views of the experts should be obtained,and not the views of the Departments as indicating departmentalpolicy.Sir David Shackleton pointed out that the proposals set out in paper G.T.-2772 were agreed to by the whole of the Departmentsconcerned.Sir Auckland Geddes stated that, as it was now the duty of theMinistry of National Service to adjudicate in all cases of labour supply, he thought it desirable, in order that he might also be in anindependent position, that he should not sit as a member of theCo-ordinating Committee, and suggested that someone else mightbe appointed instead.   He further suggested that the representa-
7WO 288tives of the big spending Departments might be appointed not as members of the Committee proper, but as assessors.The War Cabinet decided that The scheme for co-ordination, as set out in Paper G.T.-2772,should be adopted as amended, and expressed the hopethat Sir Auckland Geddes would find time to sit as&quot;vice-Chairman of the Co-ordinating Committee.Further, that the War Cabinet wished it to be understoodthat representatives of Departments on the Co-co-ordinating committee would act in a judicial capacity and not merely as representatives of their administrative Departments.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 29, 1917.
