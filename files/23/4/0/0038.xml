WITH reference to War Cabinet 262, Minute 4, the PrimeMinister read a telegram from the Chief Secretary for Ireland,stating that he regarded the situation as less serious than had beenreported, and that he had decided not to carry out the proposal,made on the previous day, to arrest a large number of Sinn Feiners.The War Cabinet considered that, in view of their decision taken that morning, to authorise the Military authorities to take such measures as they might consider necessary to meet eventualitiesin Ireland, the Chief Secretary, who had not been present at theMeeting, should be informed of this decision and also of such action as the Military authorities proposed to take.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary to arran g with the Secretary of State for war that the Field-Marshal Commanding Home Forces should.  direct the General Officer Commanding in Ireland to com-municate with the Chief Secretary.2. With reference to War Cabinet 263, Minute 14, the PrimeMinister said that he had called the Meeting in order to discuss further with his colleagues the attitude to be taken up by himself at theforthcoming Conference in Italy in regard to the various questionswhich would come up for consideration. He said that he proposed,subject to the approval of his colleagues, that he should be accompanied by General Smuts.In the course of the discussion the Prime Minister read atelegram from General TJelme-Padcliife reporting that GeneralCadoraa thought that the situation was mending.   He was convinced
that the enemy intended to drive home the attack, and, in general cadorna&apos;s view, unless largely augmented reinforcements were despatched by the French and British Governments, a militarydebacle was possible, in which case his country might be compelledto make a separate peace. The Third Italian army had so farsaved its guns, for which ammunition was available. general cadorna further reported a universal determination on the part ofhis nation to see the war through. The present reinforcementsproposed by the French and British Governments were, in general cadorna&apos;s opinion, quite inadequate.The Prime Minister said that the Italian Ambassador, who hadbeen apprised of his forthcoming visit to Italy, had interviewed him that day, and had urged very strongly that further reinforcementsshould be sent. The Prime Minister also stated that general petain had informed him that arrangements had been made byField-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and himself that the British shouldnot only take the front occupied by General Anthoine&apos;s army onthe British left, but should also take over a front at present occupied by five French divisions on the British right.It was pointed out that Sir Douglas Haig was still conductingimportant offensive operations, which, in view of the coming winter, itwas desirable should be carried to a successful issue. The point was,which was the more important : that our operations on the Flandersfront should be pressed forward, or for adequate support to begiven to Italy.to prevent her going out of the war? It was clearthat very great demands were being made on the British forces notonly for the Italian front, but also for the prosecution of the presentoffensive. It was suggested that in all probability the result would be that the main assistance to the Italian army would have tobe supplied by the French. It was conceivable that the presentdebacle might yet be turned into a victory ; everything depended onthe recovery of the Italian army, and the situation might yet be turned to our advantage.Attention was drawn to the present disposition to magnify thenumber of German divisions operating on the Italian front. Inregard to a suggestion that the Germans, acting on interior lines,might be conducting their vigorous offensive against Italy with aview to withdrawing French and British troops in order to attackour Western front, it was pointed out that even if ten british divisions were taken from that front we should still be numericallyequal, if not superior, to the opposing German forces.The War Cabinet decided that The Prime Minister, with his advisers, should have full dis-cretion to make such arrangements as they might consider necessary to meet the situation.3. The Prime Minister read out a telegram from the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stating that he had seen stragglers intrains 25 miles behind the Italian General Headquarters, which,again, were 10 miles behind the front. General Robertson thoughtthat the paralysis of the Second Army was extending to the ThirdArmy, which had, so far, hardly been attacked at all. general robertson further commented on the effectiveness of german propaganda, and the fact that, while a considerable part of theItalian nation had always been opposed to the war, the ItalianGovernment had failed to take adequate steps to suppress the propaganda and to deal with those who were responsible for it.In regard to the shortage of foodstuffs, &amp;c., in Italy, general robertson thought this was due rather to the bad arrangementsmade for. distribution than to the actual present lack of supplies.It was pointed out that if Italy went out of the war she would either starve or freeze, as she would be dependent in the coming
Air Reorganisation 4. With reference to War Cabinet 261, Minute 10, the Warand Air Offensive. Cabinet considered what progress could be made with the formationof an Air Ministry. They were aware that public opinion was becoming very restless in consequence of the delay in forming theMinistry.. It appeared desirable that steps should be taken to institute the Ministry at once, with wide, if loosely-defined, powers,leaving the details to be settled later.General Smuts, speaking as Chairman of the Air organisation committee, reported that he saw no reason why the Air MinistryBill, the draft of which was now in process of completion, should notbe before Parliament in the course of the next week or so. Thedraft Bill had been circulated to the Admiralty aud the War Office.The latter Department had promised to submit their comments and suggestions early in the following week.In regard to the question of a separate Air General Staff,General Smuts stated that the Air Policy Committee, of wdiich hewas also chairman, had at present to work through the Naval WarStaff and the Imperial General Staff, and he indicated the difficulties that lay in the way of the immediate formation of a separate AirStaff.General Smuts further said, in regard to the output of aircraft,that he was confident that the present enlarged programme ofaeroplane construction could be fully carried out. The danger wasthat it might not be possible to build the necessary aerodromes andto train a sufficient number of pilots to keep pace with the outputof aircraft.As regards independent aerial offensive operations in Francejall the necessary preparations were being made. Aerodromes werebeing constructed, and depots for the Air Service were being established in France, to be ready for the large independentoperations, it was intended should be carried out during thefollowing summer. There was, however, a slight difficulty to be overcome in regard to the Command and Second-in-Command ofthese independent offensive operations. Sir Douglas Haig desired that they should be under General Trenchard, commanding theRoyal Flying Corps in France. The idea of the Air PolicyCommittee was that they should be under the direct orders of theField-Marshal Conunanding-in-Chief in France, for the present, as,if they were placed under General Trenchard, there was a possibility that they might be subordinated to the ordinary operations of theRoyal Flying Corps in Flanders. The question was one of manywhich was being carefully examined by the. Air Policy Committee,pending the institution of the Air Ministry.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The draft Bill should be circulated to the War Cabinet atthe very earliest opportunity, and the Secretary was instructed to sive effect to this decision.months upon the Allies for both coal and food. In this connection it was suggested that the Italian nation probably were under theimpression that if they made a separate peace the war would automatically come to an end.Tbe Prime Minister read out a telegram which had just beenreceived from General Delme-Radcliffe, stating that the Italian army had safely crossed the Tagliamento; the Third Army was now proceeding to occupy the Tagliamento line, and had evacuated theirwounded and brought back all their guns except sixty. The Italianrear guards were holding back the German advance guards, andthere was some hope of the Second Army recovering its moral. Thecollection of stragglers of the Second Army was proceeding, and theItalian authorities reported that they had sufficient spare rifles torearm that army. The weather was improving. All the Britishguns had been saved, but their stores and ammunition had been lost.
(b.) General Smute should discuss the question of the command of independent aerial operations in France with theChief of the Imperial General Staff and Sir douglas haig in Paris the following day.5. The War Cabinet further considered the general question of so-called reprisals, i.e., long-range bombing operations on Germanopen towns, in retaliation for air raids on such towns in thiscountry.It was suggested that if the German Government were convincedthat we intended to carry out a systematic series of long-rangebombing operations against open German towns as soon as we werein possession of a sufficient number of aircraft of a suitable type ofour own, supplemented by the large numbers of aeroplanes whichwould be available from the United States of America in the courseof the next spring and summer, they might consider it advisable to discontinue their present raids over this country. vIn this connection attention was drawn to a telegram, dated31st October, from Lord&apos; Northcliffe to the War Cabinet (paper g.T.-2451), which raised the question as to what was most requiredby the Allied General Staff from the United States :  (a.) Aircraft,(b.) Infantry,(c.) Artillery.and stating that, when a decision had been arrived at on this point,the only two remaining factors to be considered were :  (d.) Time,(e.) Tonnage.In regard to the question of announcing to the enemy our intention of conducting retaliatory bombing raids as a matter ofpolicy, the War Cabinet agreed that it was undesirable to commit themselves in any way at the present juncture.(The discussion was adjourned.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., ,November 3, 1917.o
