Air said. 1. THE War Cabinet were informed that during the air raidon the South-Eastern Counties and London on the previous night40 bombs had been dropped in the Metropolitan area, and 12persons killed, of whom 3 were soldiers, and 60 persons injured, ofwhom 8 were soldiers, and 1 was a seaman belonging to the UnitedStates Navy.Three bombs were dropped at Orford and two at Kelvedonin  Essex, but no casualties took place.    Twelve bombs were.dropped on Dover, 2 people being killed and 7 wounded.   Fivebombs were dropped on Margate, 8 people being wounded.The War Cabinet were informed by the Military authorities that our aircraft went up, but were not able to discover theenemy&apos;s machines, such being at night almost a matter ofimpossibility.Counter-attack. 2. It was stated that information had been received that aspecial squadron of from 30 to 40 Gofcha machines had beenprovided for the express purpose of bombing English towns, andthat up to the present it had not been possible to bring this squadron up to its full strength.Their aerodrome had only just been definitely located, and instructions had been sent to Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig thatit was to be attacked as soon as possible.Defence against 3. Military experts present stated that the only real defenceAir raids . against night raids by enemy aeroplanes was the destruction oftheir bases, and that no local means of keeping off such attacks had yet been discovered. Many examples were given of nightraids both by our own aircraft and by the enemy in France and flanders on positions where a large amount of aerial protectionwas available.Lord French stated that, provided the range was not over,000 feet, which might.perhaps be extended to 9,000 feet, apossible local means of defence appeared to be numeroussearchlights of a more powerful type than those at present in use,experiment having shown that within that range they had a verybewildering effect on the pilots. Only one such powerful search-light was at present available for the defence of- London, but sixmore had been ordered in France, and it was hoped would besupplied in the near future. ,Protection andCover in Air raids .Offensive Opera-tions.4. The War Cabinet discussed the question of issuing ordersso as to enforce people to take cover when an air raid was imminent or probable, but the views held were that, though it was highly desirable to issue a strong warning that people should not remain in the streets, it was impossible, owing to night shifts andfor other reasons, to prohibit movement in the streets during fixedhours. It was felt, however, that as these air raids might become very frequent in the future, it was highly desirable to organiseshelters and to issue instructions as to their occupation prior tothe attack taking place, and even to consider the question ofdug-outs.5. The War Cabinet further felt that we must carry the aerialwar into Germany, not merely on the ground of reprisal; and that enquiries must be made as to how soon and in what manner thisoffensive aerial warfare^could be adopted. In this connection sir william Weir stated that machines capable of carrying outbombing expeditions were now being delivered, and that asregards any further development of aeroplanes (in addition to the
3 -WO 228programme of 3,000 a month from the United Kingdom and 1,000a month from our Allies and United States of America), it was aquestion of increasing the supply of engines, which were the deter -mining factor as regards output. He stated that every source ofproduction had been considered, and that the matter was entirelyone of priority as regards skilled labour and supply of materials.As regards the provision of pilots for any increased programme,Sir David Henderson stated that the training of pilots was onlylimited by the number of training machines supplied.Investigation by 6. The War Cabinet requested General Smuts to  hold  anGeneral Smuts. investigation into the last two nights&apos; raids and favour the WarCabinet with his views as to the provision of protection for thecivil population in the future, and his proposals as to carrying theair war into Germany at the earliest possible moment.Statement as tothe advantages of . The War Cabinet decided That the Home Office should carefully examine all theavailable evidence in regard to the casualties that had arisen under cover and out of doors. It was stated thatthe investigations already made by the Home Office inconjunction with the Military Authorities proved con-clusively the advantage of taking cover in buildings andpreferably in the lower floors. It was decided to issue inthe evening papers a notice drawing attention to the com-parative safety which is ensured by taking cover, andimpressing the same on the general public.Sir Edward Carson undertook to approve the draft on behalfof the War Cabinet.Air Raid on &apos; 8. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported  that  theChatham. casualties at  Chatham  Depot  amounted   to  110  killed,   115wounded, and 8 slightly wounded.Publication of Air 9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out thatRaid Casualties. the publication of casualties in navy and military personnel wasa great assistance and encouragement to the enemy. lord french concurred with this view. Sir David Henderson drew attention to the assistance rendered to the enemy by the publica-tion of any casualties, particularly when the district was specifiedas in the case of the recent raid on Chatham.The War Cabinet decided That in future announcements as to casualties, those from theNavy and Army should not be included, but should be looked upon as the ordinary casualties of warlikeoperations.As regards the question of not publishing any furthernumerical lists of casualties caused by air raids, the War cabinet felt that no decision could be taken in such a matter until theyhad had the benefit of the views of the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs, but that as regards the locality in which the casualtiesarose no communication should in future be made.Bombardment of           10. Lord French informed the War Cabinet that a submarineScarborough.           had yesterday fired thirty rounds, of which half had fallen intothe sea, at Scarborough.   Little material damage had been done,and the vessel had been driven off by the fire of some mine-sweepers. _

The submarine sank stern first.Bombardment ofOstend.15.

The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that twoBruges. air raids had been carried out on Bruges Docks and that *1\ tonsof bombs had been dropped.Sheds had been set on fire, and apparently  a  considerableamount of damage had been effected.17. It was brought to the notice of the War Cabinet that thepresent system of convoys resulted in difficulties in working the cargoes at the ports concerned.The War Cabinet realised that this was inevitable, but thatdoubtless steps could be taken to obviate the same.Sir Eric Geddes stated that with regard to losses in convoys of late, it was due to such convoys being separated by bad weather,and that on the whole the convoy system had up to the presentproved satisfactory.Award of Medals 18. The War Cabinet had under consideration  the  Memo-for the present randum by the Secretary of State for War (G.T.-1839), the Corri-War. gendum from the First Lord of the Admiralty (G.T.-1839a), andthe Memorandum of the Secretary of State for India (G.T.-1927)on the subject of the award of medals.

The War Cabinet discussed a memorandum by lord robert Cecil on the desirability of sending a Military Mission tothe Serbian Army (G.T.-1913). There was general agreement that it was desirable to take steps to encourage the SerbianGovernment and Army and to make them realise that we take an interest in them,vand that it was no objection to such steps beingtaken that they might not meet with General SarraiTs approval,or might even contribute to bringing about his withdrawal.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to appointto Serbian Headquarters an officer of suitable seniority as liaison officer, this officer to report direct to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.21. With reference to War Cabinet 226, Minute 8, lord milner stated that he had received a letter from the Russian naval representative in this country asking that the 14-inch guns whichwere awaiting shipment and had been paid for by the RussianGovernment should be forthwith sent to that country.In view of the decision arrived at as recorded in the above-quoted Minute, the War Cabinet requested Lord Milner to reply that the matter would be brought before the War Cabinet nextFriday, and requested the Departments concerned to be preparedto report on the subject on that date.Supplies forEussia.22.
