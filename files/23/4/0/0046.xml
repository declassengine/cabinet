WITH reference to War Cabinet 263, Minute 13, theChancellor of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinet thatMr. Asquith had put a question to him that afternoon in the Houseof Commons, asking whether the Prime Minister would beprepared to make a full statement in Parliament in regard to &apos;&apos; thevery serious matters touched on in his recent speech in Paris.&quot;The War Cabinet agreed that it was desirable that the PrimeMinister should make a statement on the subject of the supreme war Council, offering an opportunity for a full discussion, if parliament so desired, at an early date.The War Cabinet inclined to the view that it was probablyadvisable that any such discussion should take place in secret session, in view of the secrecy of the considerations involved. no decision, however, on this point was reached. It was agreed thatno discussion in Parliament should take place on the following day.Conference in italy.2. The Prime Minister made the following statement in regardto the Italian situation, which he characterised as being a very anxious one. He said that the views of the generals he consulted on the spot had already been telegraphed to the War Cabinet.Perhaps the most serious factor was the immense quantity of artil-lerv and ammunition which had been lost.    It was doubtful to
what extent the guns which the Italian retreating forces had hadto relinquish had been destroyed. The transport was in such anexhausted state that unless it were given time to rest and recoverit would also have to be sacrificed. The Italians had lost alreadyabout 2,500 guns, many of large calibre, and considerably over200,000 prisoners. Should the Piave line be lost nearly all theremaining guns would go too. If the Germans brought up any considerable quantity of heavy artillery the Italians could notdispose of enough heavy ordnance to hold successfully any line ofdefence. The chief contributory cause to the present disaster wasthe inefficiency which had been revealed of the Italian higher command and General Staff, and we had accordingly made thefirst condition of our assistance the replacement of general cadorna and his Staff. The Headquarters Staff had been quiteunable to grip hold of the situation and to keep in touch with andcontrol the movements of the Italian forces. The dispositionswere bad, the Staffs generally inefficient, and no communicationhad been maintained. Both our own and the French military advisers had represented that General Cadorna was quite unfittedto retain the supreme command of the Italian forces. The diffi-culty was to find a suitable successor. His Chief of the Staff,General Porro, did not inspire confidence, to say the least of it.The Due d&apos;Aosta had great soldierly qualities, but he was rather agallant leader of troops than a profound student of militaryscience. In any case, it would be difficult to replace him at thehead of the Third Army. The King of Italy, who was setting a fine example of invincible courage and unshaken confidence,attributed the rout of the Second Army to the fact that they were taken unprepared, under cover of mist, and he placed littlecredence in the stories of pacifist propaganda having underminedthe soldierly spirit of the officers and men.As regards reinforcements, the first French divisions had arrived well up to time, and had advanced towards the Piave, but had then been sent back behind Lake Garda at General Cadorna&apos;request. King Victor had expressed to Mr. Lloyd George the wish that British troops, rather than the French, should extend the Italian front line on the left. It was reported that Frenchartillerymen, who had gone with 100 guns a month or two beforeto the Italian front, had unwittingly dope a good deal of harm byspreading exaggerated stories of German frightfulness.As regards the Italian representative on the Supreme allied council, the Prime Minister said that the nominee of the ItalianGovernment was General Porro, who had been General Cadorna&apos;sChief of Staff. As already stated, however, neither the french military Authorities nor our own had any confidence in GeneralPorro. Feeling, consequently, that it would be quite impossibleto confide the vital secrets of three Allied nations to a man who wasnot trusted bv the British and French Military Authorities, Mr.Lloyd George said that, whether that lack of confidence was justified or not, the French President of the Council and he had agreed each to make a strong protest to the Italian Government onthe subject. These protests were made, the one by telegraphthrough the British Ambassador at Rome, and the other personally to Signor Berenini, the Italian Minister who attended theannouncements in Paris on Monday, the 12th November.Relations betweenthe Army Counciland the british military Repre-sentative on theSupreme WarCouncil.3. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on a copy ofthe proceedings of the Army Council of the 12th November, 1917,which thev had before them, regarding the relations between theArmy Council and the British Military Representative with theSupreme War Council, and stating that the Council presumed thatthe technical advice given bv the British Military Representative
would be given on behalf of the Army Council, and that he wouldbe subject to the authority of, and receive his instructions from,the Army Council.The War Cabinet decided To defer the question for their further discussion later.4. With reference to War Cabinet 271, Minute 1, the WarCabinet were informed that the French Government had not putforward any suggestion to the Prime Minister that General FayoUeshould command both the British and French reinforcements.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 14, 1917.The ChiefCommand ofBritish and french troops in Italy.
