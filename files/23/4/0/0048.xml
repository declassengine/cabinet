The Western Front. 1. With reference to War Cabinet 273, Minute 7, the Directorof Military Operations informed the War Cabinet that one more german division had arrived in the vicinity of Passchendaele fromthe Russian front, making a total of three since the 28th October.More counter-attacks were probable, but the recent german counter-attack had been a complete failure, and the Director ofMilitary Operations saw no reason why we should not hold theline with the troops at present available, although a continuation of our attack might be checked. He added that we were stillsuperior on that front as regards men, guns, and ammunition, andalso have the advantage of position, but that any further heavy guns sent to Italy would probably have to come from the battlefront, where the enemy was very strong in artillery.The view was expressed that nothing could be worse for thiscountry than that we should be driven back from the PasschendaeleRidge.2. The Director of Military Operations stated that a report had been received from General Plumer to the effect that tacticallythere was no cause for anticipating more than local loss of ground,but the question had to be considered as to whether one or twolocal reverses would mean a general abandonment of the line nowheld. General Plumer had asked that two more divisions andone cavalry brigade might be held in readiness to augment theexisting British forces in Italy, and arrangements had been madefor them to stand by. A telegram had been sent to general plumer, asking if he wished these divisions, &amp;c, despatched1immediately after those now under orders. General Mauriceadded that two Austrian divisions had been moved from the Piaveto the mountainous district in the north, with a view to turning theItalian left flank, and that there was general activity on the whole front. Generally speaking, the situation depended mainly on whether the mountain flank could be held.The Invasion ofItaly.Supreme War 3. With reference to War Cabinet 273, Minute 5, attentionCounci1- was drawn to telegram No. 1260 from Paris, dated 14th November,1917, stating that General Foch is to stay on the Italian frontfor the present, and it was suggested&apos;that if General Foch staysin Italy, where General Cadorna already is, General Wilson should remain to maintain the integrity of the Permanent Military Rep-representatives&apos;to the Supreme War Council. On the other hand, itwas pointed out that now that General Plumer has arrived, general wilson&apos;s services are not so needed, and that it was unfair to bothGeneral Wilson and General Plumer that the former should remain; further, that General Wilson and General Foch were sentto the Italian front not so much as Permanent Military Repre-sentatives on the Council, but for the reason that the advice of senior generals was required at short notice, and that they were immediately available.The War Cabinet decided that: The Secretary of State for War should, on behalf of the WarCabinet, inform General Sir Henry Wilson that, as general Plumer has arrived, he should now return forthe purpose of organising his Staff with a view to theassumption of his new functions at Versailles at a very early date.Palestine. 4 The Director of Military Operations reported that general allenby was continuing to make satisfactory progress in Palestine,that he had now captured the railway junction between Jaff a andJerusalem, and had advanced beyond that point. In front of him were the remnants of five Turkish divisions, while a similar
Russia.Zeebrugge.Submarines.6. With reference to War Cabinet 273, Minute 12,, the first sea Lord reported that the coastal motor-boat M.B. 7 had now returned, having been delayed by fog.7 The First Sea Lord reported that the destroyer &apos;; Fire-drake &quot; had attacked an enemy submarine, and that-aparavanehad exploded in contact with the vessel, which indicated theprobable loss of the submarine.8. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet, thatm-formation had been received that a steamer  ad attacked a sub-marine by gunfire, and claimed to have hit her with the tourtnshot.The Italian Navy.Naval Co-operation in Supreme WarCouncil.q In reply to a question as to why German submarine activityhad becone quiesint^of late, the First Sea Lord expressed the viewthat th^Germans had made a great effort during the past month, S&amp;SESifljf reaction Sad taken place, baUhrtthe enemy submarines were now coming out again on the trade routes, etc.10. The First Sea Lord reported that he had received informa-tion from the Italian Naval Attache that Admiral de Revel isabout to submit an application for the assistance of twenty Britishdestroyers, and that he (Admiral Jellicoe) had asked for informa-tion as to how it was proposed to employ them.It was urged that advantage should be taken of any suchrequest for assistance, to obtain greater control over the allied naval forces in the Mediterranean, and this raised the question ofnaval co-operation in the new Supreme War Council. The view was expressed that centralization of naval control was equallydesirable to that of military control, but that it should be a separately -ate organisation and should have its headquarters in London.number of enemy divisions, including one that had recently arrived from Aleppo, were opposed to his forces on his right. In reply tothe Prime Minister, General Maurice agreed that General Allenbyhad probably destroyed the equivalent of about four Turkishdivisions, as well as capturing about one half the artillery of five divisions.The point was raised as to whether recent telegrams that hadbeen sent to General Allenby might not be construed by him as indicating that the War Cabinet did not wish to press the successeshe had achieved, but General Maurice and Lord Derby thoughtthat that would not be the result, and that there would be an oppor-tunity of clearing up any misconception on that point as soon as general Allenby&apos;s appreciation of the situation, which had beentelegraphed for (War Cabinet 271, Minute 2), had been received and considered.5. In connection with the absence of news from Russia, theFirst Sea Lord reported that he had telegraphed to the senior naval Officer, Archangel, directing him to use every endeavourto obtain from Moscow, Petrograd and Hango an appreciation ofthe situation.
11. In view of the arrival in London of the representativesof the United States of America, and the consequent desirabilityof proceeding with the duties allocated to the Inter-Allied Council(War Cabinet 251, Minute 14), the War Cabinet felt that Mr.Austen Chamberlain, who is at present on a visit to the british front in Flanders, should be present in this country.The Secretary of State for War undertook to send a telegram to Mr. Austen Chamberlain in this sense.It was mentioned that the French had, up to the present, notnominated their representatives to the Inter-Allied Council, andthat Mr. Crosby had been delegated by the United States Govern-ment as the Chairman of the Council.Inter-allied council.Negotiations with colonel House&apos;mission.12. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to thefact that no machinery exists at the moment for co-ordinatingdiscussions with Colonel House and the American Mission, whohad been in this country for some days. It was pointed out thatthe questions which it had originally been proposed to discuss with Colonel House had, owing to the Italian disaster, been com-pletely changed since they had been drawn up, such disasterhaving precipitated the establishment of the Supreme WarCouncil, and brought in elements of uncertainty and consequentdelay in the discussion of plans for 1918 or 1919. Also that,although the Departments generally had rendered every assistancein their power to the Mission, it was beyond and outside their power to give information which depended on the decisions whichmight be arrived at as to our future war policy, as well as to the disposition of the United States troops, either on the western front or in Russia, or whether they were to be asked, owing to theshortage of tonnage, to curtail their expeditionary forces andaugment their supply to the Allies of food, munitions, &amp;c.The War Cabinet held the view that, as a preliminary toarriving at a decision as to our plans for 1918, &amp;c, it wasnecessary that the several General Staffs should circulate theirideas as to the policy to be adopted in those years and to com-municate them to the Permanent Military Representatives on theSupreme War Council, in order that the latter body mightprepare their recommendations for the consideration of theseveral Governments concerned.Proposed Con- 13. Lord Milner stated that Lord Reading had suggestedference in Paris. that it was most undesirable that Colonel House should proceedto Paris before his discussion with the British Government was completed, particularly as, owing to the fall of the FrenchGovernment, he would probably find matters there in a state of chaos.Lord Reading therefore thought that a special effort should bemade by the Prime Minister to induce Colonel House to prolonghis stay in Europe for a week.The War Cabinet decided that s (a.) The Prime Minister and Mr. Balfour should, in the firstinstance, see Colonel House as soon as possible, and discuss further procedure, and should endeavour to induce him to prolong his stay accordingly.(6.) If Colonel House is prepared to remain, the Secretary ofStafe for Foreign Affairs should point out to theFrench Government the desirability, under existingcircumstances, of postponing the Conference till aboutthe 29th November.
[1365-274] CDemobilisation. 14. The War Cabinet considered the Second Interim Eeportof the Committee on the Demobilisation of the Army, togetherwith a memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction (paper g.T.-2446).Dr. Addison summarised the main recommendations of theReport, and suggested certain modifications.    It was estimatedthat it would be possible to transport up to 20,000 men per day from France, and an equivalent number might be discharged fromthe forces at home, making 40,000 per day in all.   Only about80 per cent., however, of the forces could be demobilised at thismaximum rate; the remainder would be required to handle stores,&amp;c, and to help in the work of demobilisation.   It was proposedjthat the Foreign Office should be authorised to negotiate with france and Belgium for port and rail facilities, and with Hollandas regards interned prisoners.   Subject to military exigencies andto priority being given in certain special cases,  the order  of discharge should be governed by the needs of trade and industry,the alternative to bring home the armies in France by militaryformation being open to decisive objections.     The committee recommended that legislation should be proceeded with providing a free unemployment insurance policy valid for one year, the rateof benefit to be a minimum of 10s. per week, with power toincrease the amount to 20s. or 25s. in  special  circumstances.Dr. Addison suggested that the minimum rate&quot; should be 15s.In the case of officers and men in like circumstances whose reason-able claims for assistance during unemployment would not be met by unemployment insurance, financial assistance should be grantedthrough  the  Civil Liabilities   Commission.     The  Committeefurther   recommended   that  a   statutory   right    should    begiven to  the soldier to priority of employment  with  his  oldemployer, subject to certain limitations.  Dr. Addison wished this to be referred back for further consideration, as he understoodsome of the larger trade unions were opposed to it.   The report made proposals to assist officers and men of like standing to re-settle in civil life by the creation of a special organisation under theMinister of Labour, to be called  the Appointments Board for officers, and to co-operate with University Appointments boards and other approved organisations, and to be represented by localCommittees throughout the country.General Macready stated that Sir Douglas Haig wished tocall attention to a great difficulty of demobilising in terms ofindustry. The maintenance of discipline among the troops left inFrance, especially among the Dominion troops, after the close ofhostilities, would be a matter of great anxiety, and the &quot; war period &apos;&apos; should be continued until the troops from the dominions had left France. With regard to the suggestion of a statutoryright to employment, such a provision would be a hardship on theold regular soldier.Sir Reginald Brade said that the figure of 20,000 to bebrought daily from France must be regarded as a maximum andnot an average. In reply to questions, Sir Reginald Brade saidthat the scheme drawn up by the Committee would admit of partof the army being kept in being, and a part demobilised. Thequestion of re-mobilisation was not dealt with in the present report, but it was being carefully considered.The War Cabinet decided  .(a.) To approve the general prinfciples laid down in thereport. f(b.) To refer back for further consideration by representa-tives of the Ministry of Labour, the War Office, andthe Ministry of Reconstruction, the scale of unemploy-ment benefit and the recognition of a statutory rightto employment.(o.) To express their appreciation of the valuable services rendered by the Demobilisation Committee.
Representation of 15. With reference to a Memorandum by the Home secretary the People Bill.       dealing with clause 5 of the Representation of -the People Bill(Paper G.T.-2599), the War Cabinet decided-fa.) To agree to the proposal to give a vote to soldiers&apos;and sailors who have served in this war at the age of 19.(b.) Not to extend a similar concession to army nurses andother women coming within the clause, unless there appeared to be a widespread movement in the Houseof Commons in its favour.The Education Bill. 16. With reference to War Cabinet 26S1, Minute 10, the *Prime Minister stated that he would take an early opportunityto announce that, subject to the exigencies of the war, the Govern-ment proposed to give precedence to the Education Bill next session.Pacifist Activities 17;. With reference to War Cabinet 253, Minute 1, the Warin Great Britain.      Cabinet had before them the following documents : (a.) Memorandum by Sir Edward Carson (Paper G.-157).(&amp;.) Memorandum   bv   the   Minister   of   Labour   (paper g.T.-2274).(c.) Note by Sir George Cave (Paper G.-173).It was pointed out that the Home Secretary submitted recom-mendations for the issue of two new Regulations under the Defenceof the Realm Act. First, a Regulation following No. 27aa, to theeffect that it shall not be lawful for any person to print or publishany leaflet dealing with the continuance of the war or the conclu-sion of peace, unless (a.) The name and address of the author and printer bepublished on each copy;(b.) The contents have been approved by the Directors of thePress Bureau.Second, a Regulation following No. 51a, to the effect that theHome Secretary be empowered to suspend the publication of anypaper which has contravened Regulation 27 or 27a.Considerable doubt was expressed with regard to both the efficacy and desirability of the second of the above proposed Regu-lations. It was thought that the existing powers, whereby theauthorities can seize the printing press of any publisher who con-contravenes the Regulations, were sufficient to deal with dangerouspublications. On the other hand, it was pointed out that while this power had been used effectively in the past in the case of the&quot; Forward &quot; and the &quot; Globe,&quot; it was very difficult to put this power into action in connection with leading daily papers such asthe &quot; Morning Post &quot; and the &quot; Daily News.&quot; The solidarity ofthe press was so strong that it was practically impossible toprevent an almost unanimous outcry by all the newspapers in theevent of any further interference, while, at the same time, suppression-sion gave a great advertisement to the suppressed newspaper andraised a storm of controversy.Sir Edward Carson suggested that possibly the best and most useful method of dealing with the ordinary press would be totake power to appoint a censor in the office of an offending news-paper, who should have the power of prohibiting the publicationof any matter which, in his opinion, contravened the Regulations.These censors would be useful for other purposes, such as providinginformation regarding the export of printed matter.Another suggestion was that the Government should controlmore closely, either through the Paper Commissioner or through
Needs of the Irish 18. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by Mr.Executive. Duke on the subject of the needs of the Irish Executive (paper g.T.-2533), and authorised (a.) The appointment of a Commission to investigate thepresent position of public education in Ireland.(&amp;.) The circulation to the War Cabinet of a draft Bill, whoseobject should be the placing of Ireland on the same footing as England in respect of powers for the feedingof necessitous school children by combined funds,drawn half from the local rates and half from theTreasury grant.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 15; 1917.o *the paper trade, the supply of paper. Here, however, there were many subterfuges and evasions possible, and it would be fatal toestablish machinery that failed to be effective.General Cockerill stated that in his opinion the blacking outof articles in newspapers was a most unsatisfactory expedient, thenature of the article so blacked out being almost invariably obviousand attention being drawn to it. Early in the war the press had agreed to refrain from this practice which prevails whenevercensorship is effected after the type has been set up.The War Cabinet took note of the Report upon Pacifist andRevolutionary Organisations in the United Kingdom, prepared byMr. Basil Thomson on behalf of Scotland Yard, and decided that-(a.) The proposed Regulation following No. 27aa, regardingthe name and address of the author and printer of- leaflets and the submission of leaflets to the PressBureau, should be authorised, subject to some verbalalterations proposed by the Home Secretary.(b.) Reports regarding pacifist and revolutionary organisa-tions in the United Kingdom should be submitted bythe Home Secretary to the War Cabinet periodically,and should, if possible, include greater detail.(c.) The Home Secretary and Sir Reginald Brade shouldsound the press with regard to the&apos; suggestion toappoint censors in offending newspaper offices, throughthe medium of the Admiralty and War Office PressCommittee.
