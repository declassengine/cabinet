WITH reference   to   the  formation of a regiment fromginient. the foreign mainly Russian Jews in this country, the Secretaryof State for War informed the War Cabinet that he had receiveda very - influential deputation of Jews, who had objected to the title &quot;The Jewish Regiment&quot; which had been sanctioned by theWar Office. The deputation had urged that some 40,000 Jews had served with distinction in the British forces, and that it was not fair to them to stake the whole reputation of English Jews as fighterson the performance of this regiment. In view of this, the Secretaryof State for War proposed to abandon the title of &quot; The Jewish[1365-227] B
Regiment,&quot; and to give the regiment a number, leaving open thequestion of adding any further designation which might express the particular character or aspiration of the regiment, but whichwould not involve the fighting reputation of Jews in the armygenerally. He also insisted that he could not guarantee to keep the regiment, or even a particular battalion of it, filled up with recruitswho all shared the Zionist aspirations.He hoped eventually to form four battalions, composed in themain of Foreign Jews. These would be compulsorily enlisted in thisregiment. A certain number of English Jews would be attached forthe purpose of instruction, and some had already volunteered forthat purpose, but there would be no compulsion in that connection.In the discussion that followed it was pointed out that even with Irish and Scotch regiments it has not always proved possibleto maintain the original character of the units in the drafts sent outafterwards. It was generally agreed that there was a close connection between this subject and the question of the attitude tobe taken up towards the Zionist movement as a whole.The War Cabinet decided That for the present the battalions to be formed from Jewishrecruits should receive numbers in the ordinary way, andwithout any distinctive title, without prejudice to the reconsideration of the question of the distinctive title ifa definite demand in favour of the change were substan-tially established and circumstances favoured such a&apos; policy.2. The War Cabinet had under consideration correspondencewhich had passed between the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and Lord Rothschild on the question of the policy to be adopted towards the Zionist movement (G.T.-1803). In addition to thedraft declaration of policy included in the above correspondence,they had before them an alternative draft prepared by Lord Milner(G.T.-1803 a). They had also before them a Memorandum byMr. Montagu entitled &quot; The Anti-Semitism of the present Govern-ment.&quot;It was suggested that a question raising such important issues as to the future of .Palestine ought, in the first instance, to bediscussed with our Allies, and more particularly with the UnitedStates.On the question of submitting&apos; Lord Milner&apos;s draft for theconsideration of the United States Government, Mr. Montagu urgedthat the use of the phrase &quot; the home of the Jewish people&apos;&apos; wouldvitally prejudice the position of every Jew elsewhere and expandthe argument contained in his Memorandum. Against this it was urged that the existence of a Jewish State or autonomous community in Palestine would strengthen rather than -weaken the situation of jews in countries where they were not yet in possession of equalrights, and that in c -countries like England, where they possessedsuch rights and were identified with the nation of which they werecitizens, their position would be unaffected by the existence of anational Jewish community elsewhere. The view was expressed that, while a small influential section of English Jews were opposedto the idea, large numbers were sympathetic to it, but in theinterests of Jews who wished to go from countries where they were less favourably situated, rather than from any idea of wishing to goto Palestine themselves.With reference to a suggestion that the matter might be postponed, the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that this was a question on which the Foreign Office had beenvery strongly pressed for a long time past. There was a very strong and enthusiastic organisation, more particularly in the United States,who were zealous in this matter, and his belief was that it would be
of most substantial assistance to the Allies to have the earnestnessand enthusiasm of these people enlisted on our side. To do nothing was to risk a direct breach with them, and it was necessary to facethis situation.The War Cabinet decided that The views of President Wilson should be obtained before any declaration was made, and requested the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to inform the Government ofthe United States that His Majesty&apos;s Government werebeing pressed to make a declaration in sympathy with the zionist movement, and to ascertain their views as to the advisability of such a declaration being made.3. The War Cabinet approved the report of Sir edward carson&apos;s Committee on the position of northern neutral countries(War Cabinet 191, Minute G). In doing so they took note of lord robert cecils dissent from the views of the Committee as to the undesirability of the intervention of the northern countries. lord robert Cecil developed his views on this subject and suggested thatit was not desirable to convey to the United States the impression that we, under all circumstances, regarded the intervention of thosecountries as undesirable. He also urged more particularly thedesirability of giving our diplomatic representatives a definite leadon the matter, so that they should not be at a disadvantage if acritical situation arose suddenly.The. First Sea Lord intimated that the time might come, but had not yet arrived, when the establishment of a naval base in norway might be of great advantage from the point of view of an active offensive against enemy submarines.The War Cabinet decided That the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldentrust a copy of the report to Sir W. Wiseman, who shouldpass it on to Lord Reading with permission to show it to president Wilson, with the proviso that no copy of thereport should be taken.The War Cabinet further decided That a copy of the portion of the report of the Committee which dealt with Holland should be communicated in the utmostsecrecy to the British Minister at The Hague.Lord Robert Cecil was instructed that, if any further develop-ment of the Norwegian situation took place, he should again bringthe matter before the War Cabinet.Lord Reading^ 4. With reference to War Cabinet 225, Minute 16, the SecretaryMission. was given full authority to peimit Lord Reading to take any secret war Cabinet documents he might require on his forthcoming visit to america. - The Secretary stated that he had satisfied himself thatai-rangements had been made by Colonel Swinton (who is accom-accompanying  Lord Reading) for the safety of the documents, both on the voyage and in the United States of America.The Secretary was particularly instructed to include among the documents to be taken by Colonel Swinton for Lord Reading&apos;s use acopy of a Memorandum on Naval Policy prepared by the admiralty for the Imperial War Cabinet.Air raids . 5. The Director of Military Operations gave particulars of theair raid on Dover which had taken place on the previous night inbrilliant moonlight.The First Sea Lord reported that Dunkirk had also been heavily bombed on the same nigrht.The Position ofNorthern neutral countries.[1365-227]
Arrival of TJ.S.A. 6. With reference to paragraph 45 of the Report of the CabinetTroops in Europe. Committee on War Policy (W.P.-4C), the Director of MilitaryOperations informed the War Cabinet that there was now onecomplete division of United States troops in France. It was expected that there would be further arrivals of two divisions inOctober, three in November, four in January, three in February, andso on, amounting to a total of twenty divisions by the middle of Junenext. These, with the auxiliary services, would number roughly about half a million men. It must be remembered that they would arriveuntrained, but arrangements were being- made for the training totake place in France. It was not proposed by the United states authorities to put any troops in the line this winter, because theydid not wish their men to enter the line until they had a completearmy ready. It was understood, however, that the French proposedto make representations in favour of an earlier participation by theUnited States troops.Eastern Eront. 7. The Director of Military Operations stated that the germans have crossed the Dvina and are reported to be advancing northwardon Riga, which no doubt they want for winter headquarters.Unfortunately there was no indication of&quot; any serious resistance onthe part of the Russians.Rumoured German 8. With regard to the rumours of German naval activity in the activity in the Eastern Baltic, the First Sea Lord reported that our Naval Attache&quot;k8^0, at Petrograd had made inquiries, but found no confirmation of thestories.Escaped German 9. The First Sea Lord reported that the six German prisonersPrisoners. who had escaped from Alnmouth on the 30th August in an openboat, after first being spoken by a fishing trawler, had been captured by a destroyer 150 miles east of the Tyne.As regards escaped prisoners generally, the Director of MilitaryOperations gave the following particulars showing that the super-vision in England was far more effective than in other countries.There were about 200 German prisoners from French prisonersof war camps loose in France ; 492 Russians who had escaped fromGermany through Holland were now in England, and many more were in Holland waiting to come ; but in this country there wereonlv 18 German prisoners at large.Naval Engagement 10. The First Sea Lord gave particulars of the engagement ofOff Jutland. which the news had already appeared in the press.   The Germanminesweepers were escorting submarines, one of which was reportedhit. There was no evidence as yet that territorial waters had beeninfringed by us.&quot;Convoys. 11- The First Sea Lord reported that the armed boaxdingsteamer &quot; Dundee,&quot; escorting a Gibraltar convoy, had been torpedoed180 miles from Scilly. &quot;So far as was known the rest of the convoy were proceeding safely.Air organisation committee.12. The War Cabinet agreed to the request of the Minister ofMunitions that his department should be represented on general smuts&apos; Committee.    (War Cabinet 223, Minute 12.)
27War Information to 14. With reference to a telegram from the Prime Minister of dominions Prime      the Commonwealth of Australia asking for fuller information on then    rs. submarine campaign and the progress of the&quot; war generally, the WarCabinet considered the question of the communication of information on these matters to the Dominions. It was agreed that as full information&apos;as was practicable should be sent.Mr. Lambert, on behalf of the Colonial Office, suggested that,in addition to the information on current events regularly furnished to the Dominions, it was desirable to communicate from time to timegeneral memoranda reviewing the situation as a whole, or dealingwith some particular feature of the war, such as have recently been communicated to the United States Government.The War Cabinet decided That the Secretariat should, in consultation with the Depart-ments concerned, amplify the information conveyed in thefortnightly telegrams, and should also select from amongthe War Cabinet papers, or arrange for the preparation of,such memoranda as would enable the Prime Ministers ofthe Dominions to be fully apprised of the general situation.The first step should be, so far as practicable, to answer the specific questions put by Mr. Hughes, the answer to whichshould also be communicated to the Prime Ministers of theother Dominions.(Initialled) A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 3, 1917.JoInter-Ally Trans- 13. With reference to War Cabinet 226, Minute G, the Warport Committee.       Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary (G.T.-1895).The arguments therein set forth were discussed.The First Lord said that the Americans and French wanted todiscuss the amount of shipping required for the transport of UnitedStates troops and supplies. He suggested that this discussion shouldtake the form of a private consultation between ourselves and theUnited States representatives, and should not form part of an allied conference. As the main advantage to be obtained from theConference is to reduce the amount of material to be transportedfrom America, this course commended itself to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided-That the First Lord of the Admiralty and the ShippingController should discuss the matter with a view to separate consultation with the United States representa-tives alone, and that it should be explained to the other allies, if they make inquiries, that this course was being pursued, having regard to the delicate situation that had arisen over the ownership of merchant ships under con-struction in American yards for British account.
