9 &quot;7 od I u(1) The Cabinet met an a matter of urgw^ &quot; v* .^^^1^- he -f&apos;Vd.jfc-j.,a.miA.r.. - ipr --v 3j?w- -. *t - t.,he-J^^^Ujh^ - t r j.k e.The President of the Board of Trade reported thatthe strike notices would take effect on Saturday, Octoberl*th.    At today&apos;s meeting of the Miners&apos;  Delegates,  kessrsSmlllie and Hodges had. been given full powers  to  treat withthe Government on any question which might arise, and hadbeen authorised to call off the strike in the event of theGovernment conceding the 2/- per shift advance.No evidence was at present  forthcoming of any move-ment on the part of the Transport Workers to join in thestrike.    At present the Executive of the Transport unions had no power to call a strike without first taking a ballotof  the men.There was also no evidence &amp;f any intention on thepart a f the Kaiiwaynen- to join in the strike-.    The Ra.ilw.ay-men&apos; a Executive was  to meet on the following day, and had power to declare an immediate strike.    In this connection the Cabinet were reminded that s&apos;n previous occasions theRailwayman had resorted to lightning strikes, with verylittle or no notice.Th-&apos;   Cabinet were informed by the Minister of Trans-port that at an interview on the previous day with Mr Crampthe latter had taken the line that a prolonged miners&apos; strikeweuld mean heavy unemployment among the rallwaymen^ with consequential depletion of the Union&apos;a funds.    It might,therefore j be tti the railv/railwaymen&apos; s advantage to join tin thestrike with a view to securing some pecuniary benefit by so doing.    Moreover,  if the railwaymen joined in,the strikewas mare likely to be short and sharp.On the other hand, it was pointed nut that the railwaymen were generally averse from striking, and would prefer, in the event of unemployment, to be in appositionto draw their Unemployment Insurance.Attention was drawn to the ignorance v.f the p-f-(in spite of the Government&apos; a propaganda)  in reg
^ i ofacts *f the dispute;    e.g0, it was widely believed thatthe men were striking far 2/- a ,week,  and not for 12/- a weekIt was generally  agreed that extensive propaganda by large posters should be adopted throughout  the country.The Chairman of the Supply and Transport committee reported that the following action had already be tin takenen the recommendations of that Committee(I) Ail exportation -of coal had been stopped:(ii)  The erection of a &quot;Pfreless TelegraphyStation in Hyde Park had been ordered,which would take ten days to complete.As from Saturday,  $etcher 16th., restrictions on the supply*f coal,  gas and elect;ic light would come into fore?,  and steps would be taken t^ recruit for the Special Constabularyand for other essential services.During the meeting,  further information was received to the effect that the proposal contained in that morning&apos;s&quot;Daily Mail&quot;,  that the Government should give the men an advance *f 1/-, had been discussed at the Miners&apos;  Delegatesmeeting, and that Mesere  Smillie and Hodges had been empower-ed to accept an offer on this basis.    Also that Mr Smilliehad announced his intention te resign, and had with diffi-cuity b-een Persuaded to retain his position in the Pedera-tion tempsrariTy.There was some discussion as to the procedure to beadopted in Parliament in respect to the crisis,  and it was generally agreed that the President of theScard of Tradeshoo Id make a full statement of the Government&apos;s positionas  eard y as  puDf&amp;hla afted&quot; the. rt- amnW-ly ot UtC Fonoe.

Part George to Stirling,  two Battalions ofGuards from Firbright to London, and that he had steppedall lpave.The Cabinet took note of and approvedthes e arrangements,(5) The First Lord ef the Admiralty drew attention t)the fact that Naval Ratings could rot legally be called uponto perform certain functions, such as pumping, etc.    Tho menknew their legal position, and load been urged by Bolshevikagents to refuse to obey orders in the event of a strike the Cabinet were reminded that the Emergency P-n   r.Bill had been drafted to rent this difficulty, and thru
the Recess as it was thought that such action would beregarded as provocative,l&apos;t vras generally agreed that If the railwayman wentan strike On tho fallowing day, the Leader cf the House ofCommons, in consultation with the Minister principally con-concerned, should have authority  to introduce the emergency powers Bill on Tuesday next, or later, with a view to its passage into law as quickly as passible, Parliament being asked, if necessary, to suspend the Standing Orders,    if,however, the railwayman remained at work,  the general view was that it would be better to introduce and pass the Dillinto law in the ordinary way.(4) Speaking on behalf cf his colleagues, the PrimeMinister congratulated the Proo.id.ent tit the Boari of trade on the patience, tact, skill and judgment shown by him inconducting the negotiations with the miners.    The public hadbeen greatly impressed by tho way in which the Government&apos;acase had been conducted, and the hands of tho Government had also boon greatly strengthened.The Pri e Minister also requested Ministers t-* give every possible assistance to tho Ministex of Transport,  on whom would fall tho main burden of meeting tho greatesthold-up strike by which the country had hitherto been con-fronted.

Military ? Westminster-?.

(5) With reference to Cabinet (20), Conclusion 9,  the Cabinet had under consideration a suggestion ? from the Dean of Westminster that the remains of one of the Tumerous unknown men who fell and were buried in France should be exhumed,  conveyed to England,  cremated if necessary, and given an imposing military funeral in Westminster Abbey on November llth, the date of the unveiling of the Cenotaph. A copy of the proposals is attached hereto (See Appendix).

After some discussion,  in the course of which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the Cabinet that the Army might be assumed to be unanimously in favour of the proposal, which was regarded as the greatest honour that could be paid by the nation,  the Cabinet agreed -

(a) To accept in principle the proposals contained in the Appendix, and to request a Committee, composed of -

Lord Curzon (in the Chair),

Lord Lee of Fareham,

Mr Churchill,

Mr Walter Long,

Mr Shortt, and

Sir Alfred, Mond, with Colonel Storr (Cabinet Office)  as Secretary,

in consultation with Sir Douglas Dawson, the Dean of Westminster and the Government Departments concerned, to make proposals for carrying into effect the arrangements both as regards  this proposal and the ceremony for the unveiling of the Cenotaph, and to report to the Cabinet:

(b) That the announcement of this decision should be made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the re-assembling of Parliament.
loXLnHALL (6)  The Cabinet were informed that on October 27thONlOrOBER 27%h^-^rr^OQBLj&amp;trt3- had been ^vd^-^fcrr^orrbe-rt adc 1 ng the Prince ofaales at the Guildhall in connection with his reeerrt&apos;&quot;Imperialtour.The Cabinet took the view that, having regard to theindustrial situation,  it was desirable that the entertain-ment should be postponed.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesundertook to convey this expression ofopinion to the quartern concerned.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S,V,1,October 15,  1920,
AJELP.E II D.I,k.MEMORANDUM.BgAN CF WF3TMINS&quot;EP.&apos;S SU00*STI03.Briefly:-That the remains of one of the numerous unknown men whofell and vioro buried in Prance should be exhumed, placed in ashell&quot;,    conveyed to England:    if necessary, cremated;    escort-ed by soldiers, a:? military funeral procession,  to westminster abbey:    and there, after short impressive Funeral Service, beburied in the ^aye:    a central position having been granted i:ythe Dean,  fairly opposite the great West Poor so as to be easily seen and identified by people in ail future time:That, afterwards^ a very short,  simple inscription be cuton the stone, which would be applicable to all branches ofH.lv&apos;i. Services,  for example:-/&apos; BRITISH WARRIORWHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR1914-1918FOP KING AND COUNTRY.The idwa has been submitted to the King, who, approvinggenerally, desired the Dean to consult the Prime Minister; andhe has done so.    The Dean has consulted Field. Marshal sir henry Wilson, who warmly supports the suggestion:    recommended for the inscription a neutral word like &quot;Warrior&quot;,  so as toinclude Naval, Air Force, as well as Army;    and promised kindass is tance.The time is short.    But Sir Henry Wilson gave the Deanto understand that there need be no difficulty in carryingout the necessary arrangements with promptitude.It might be possible to combine such a ceremony with theunveiling of the Cenotaph;    havina the Funeral Service, e,g.at 13 or 12-30.The,objections ha^e been made:(a) That it is too late:But not too late iu carried out about the same date asthe Cenotaph.(b) That it is sensational.But any appeal to national sentiment is open tothis charge.The advantagea would be that it would generally be accept-able tc the people;    that it would do honour to the great mass of fighting men;    that it would furnish a Memorial tothem in Westminster Abbey, without singling out for suchdistinction any one known man.    At present Westminster Abbeylias no memorial of the Great war.
