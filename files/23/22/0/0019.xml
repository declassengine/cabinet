5.4L STRIKE. (1)   y&apos;ith reference to Cabinet 5* (20),  Conclusion ithe Cabinet met at short notice in view of the critical situation which had arisen in the course ofthe Ooai strike negotiations.The Prime minister explained the presentposition In the negotiations.He recalled that  the miners had ashed fora rise of P/- per shift.    Th? -ov *rnmout ha^i offered to give this on condition that they realised an output pit the rate of 248 million tons per annum,with a sliding scale.      This was   -oferred to theminers and rejected by an overwhelming: majority,the opposition to the    datura line11 being greaterthan that for a strike.      In the subsequent negotiations,the Government had proceeded with two alternatives:The first a modification of the   &apos;daturn line&quot; with ageneral scaling down.    The alternative tothis was based on profits..    If the  increase  in the values derived from export prices went up to acertain figure the miners were t&quot;i get their increase *This was only another method of securing the output,,There were two possibilities to be reckoned with, -prices might rise or they might fall, the latterowing to exports from the United Ctates.    On the wholeour information iyas that a substantial fall was unlikely owing to the existence of contracts alreadyconcluded by our  exporters.-.      The government representatives had framed a scheme for giving theminors  the 9/- providing that by a  certain date,If the profits had not reached a certain In figure,i.e.  if the miners had not produced a  certain output,the advance should come off automatically.,
In the course of the negotiations the Miners&apos; Executive had agreed that in the case of a satisfactory settlement they would vigorously take up the question of output with their men,  and in this connection they had strongly complained of the apathy  of the owners, who, they alleged with good grounds, were not making a real of effort to increase output, were neglecting their good sears and were spending money in preparation for the period of de-control.    The owners, in fact, under the present arrangement had no incentive to work the mines at their maximum capacity.  The miners complained that the Government demanded guarantees from the men for the automatic reduction of wages in the event of a fall in output, while the owners, who were equally responsible, were not asked for any guarantee or sacrifice.  It had therefore be ? to ask the owners to forgo, in certain eventualities, (Emergency) some of the profits accruing to the under the Coal Mine Act.  The Government had thus, by the beginning of the present week, reached a position of offering 8/- advance immediately to the miners,  on condition that if by December 4th. values did not reach 246,000,000 tons at the fixed September price, the 2/- would be scaled down in December on the basis of the realised output. The Miners&apos;  Executive contended that this did not give the sufficient ? to put the ? in working order and to organise their output campaign among the men.

Part of the terms of the settlement provided for the owners and miners setting up a Point Committee for the working out of a per ? scheme to regulate the wages in the industry. The miners, at their last interview with the Government that afternoon, had agreed to a settlement provided three ? in ?,  together with the last two weeks in November as the basis for fixing the January wages. The President of the Board of Trade had laid great stress on securing the last, half of November as
a part of the testing period.    The Government feared that anattempt would he made in December to resist any reductionin the 2/-, if justified by a deficiency in output, because it wo^ld bo arpuod that such a reduction would prejudice thesucoessf.il formulation of the permanent scheme.    It had therefore been made perfectly clear that in the case of a deficiency -here would be an automatic scaling down, andthat the last two weeks in November must be included in thedetermining period.    These two points had been definitelyaccepted by the Executive.    The&apos;-wag---s for February would depend on the January output, and so on for later months,until the permanent scheme came into operation.    It was doubtful ivhether this national scheme could be worked out and agreed upon for some time.    It was probable,  therefore,that the present settlement would fix the wages in the coal-olds *or several months to come.The question thus narrowed itself down to whether weshould allow the 2/- to remain on between December 11 (towhich we had already agreed) and January 1;    or, in effect,to a guarantee of 2/- up to the end of Dece- ber irrespective of output.The Prime Minister pointed out that this was the first time that wages were definitely related&apos; to output, and thefirst time (apart from the early days of the War)  that theMiners&apos;  Federation had recognised that an increased outputof coal was a vital need for the nation, and had&apos;pledgedtheir honi-nr to endeavour to secure the increase.    Itshould, be understood the&apos;; the Miners&apos;  Federation, of course,government only agreed to place the proposals bsfo:their delegatesiThe President of the Board of Trad- gave some fartherexplanations of details of the draft agreement, a copy ofwhich is attached in the Appendix.The general view of the Cabinet was that, whatever line the public might take on the agreement as a whole, they
certainly would not consider the Government Justified: inbreaking off on tho difforonco between Jooonber 11 and January 1.It was pointed out, however,  that if *Lo D.1 Dragonera *  vorniftwof the agreement was put before the public4  the agreementmicrht be interpreted as a complete defeat of the Government.Stress was therefore laid on the Importance of a very fulland clear statement of the Government&apos;s case being made inParliament at the earliest possible moment.      There was some discussion as  to when this moment should be.    The cabinet were reminded that to make a statement dwelling toe much onthe advantages of the agreement, and particularly on thefact that output was related to wages, would make very muchmore difficult&apos; the task of the Executive of the Miners&apos;Federation in securing acceptance by their delegates.The suggestion was made that the comparative successderived by the miners from this strike might encourage other unions *o corresponding action.    It was pointed rut., however that public opinion,  though at the outset urging the Goveru-ment to stand firm, had weakened a good deal when faced withthe realities of the strike.    Cn the other hand,  there was general agreement that the country was solidly settling, do v. &quot;behind the Government against grave disturbances of thiskind.The Cabinet agro-d  (a) To authorise the Prime Minister to con- -elude an agreement en the liries ho had proposed:(go) That the Prime Minister should have a freehand to make th--. best arrangements as to th&apos;-tlme and place of the: public statement to bemad a o n t h e s ub i e c t.(2) In the course of the previous discussion the Cabinetgenerally expressed their sense of gratitude to the PrimeMinister and those of his colleagues who had conducted thenegotiations with the miners with so much patience andskill.
* Comment wan made, -however, on the great drain which thesefrequent and prolonged labour negotiations made on the timeC Of the Prime Minister, and the difficulty which might be experienced in the future if there should be a Prime Min-ister less experienced and skilful in negotiations of thishind.    It was pointed out, however,  that the agreement nowunder consideration gave promise of the initiation of ascheme which, no far as Coal was concerned, might in thefuture relieve the Government of a good deal of negotiation of this hind.The Cabinet \.ere also reminded that the Government hadstood in special relations of control to the Railways and coal,  and that at any time v. rational, strike in twosuch vital Industries would be board seriously to involvethe time cf the Prime Minister and the Government.llVORGE PILL.        (3)  Attention was drawn&apos; to a recent statement that the divorce Bill would not be passed this Session. . It wassuggested that the ratter ought  to be discussed by theCabinet before a decision was taken.    It was pointed outthat this was a Private Bill,  and that it was not customaryto give time to Private Bills in an Autumn Session,.ia-CRIAL 3BRVTCh3(4) With reference to Cabinet 56 .(2.:),  Conclusion 5 andiN NOVEMBER 11 th.AND--*appendix,  the Cabinet had before them a Note by Lord Cue2oncowrinr provisional recommendations of the Committee ap-pointed to arrange for the two ceremonies on November lith?&apos;,namely, the unveiling of the Cenotaph and the interment ofthe nameless warrior in Westminster Abbey (Paper 0.P.-CC08).The Prime Minister suggest d the desirability of a meet-ine beinrr arranged of the leaders cf the Churches to cldocsea representative to tak&quot; charge of the brief religiousService at &quot;the unveilirv: of the Cenotaph.The Cabinet approved the recommendationsof the. Committee, -and also the Prim-Minister&apos; s suggestion.
