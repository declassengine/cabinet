1 q 9a. *J t.*BoNOS ON WAR (l) With reference to Cabinet 40 (20), Conclusion 8, and appendix I, Conclusion 2 (i.e., the Conference of ministers of July 5, 1920). the Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-1846) urging thatapproval should be given to the proposals contained in theJoint Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and himself(Paper CP.-1464), that in view of the increase in the costof living since the rotes of pensions and allowances were fixed in September, 1919, weekly bonuses should be grantedof :-(a) 5/- a week in the case of disabled mendrawing total disablement pension or inreceipt of allowances in respect of eithermedical treatment or training at the max-minimun pension rate:(b) 2s.6d.  a week to ail widows over 40 or having children under their caie:(c) 2s.6d. a week to all dependants in receiptof a pension based on need.In addition to the arguments advanced on the pre-vious oocasioRt it was pointed out in support of the pro-posals that in consequence of the decision fixing the approved scale of allowances until March, 1923, th? rates ofpensions and training allowances have remaizred unchanged,notwithstanding that the cost of living between August, 1919,and August, 1920, had risen 40 points, i.e., 155 points In1920 as against 115 points in 1919, over pre-war prii.es.    Itwas also urged that the present rates gave rise to acute dis-satisfaction among the ex-Service men, and that it would benot only just but expedient to endeavour to mitigate comingindustrial unrest by making some general increase in thescale of allowances.On the other hand it was pointed out that tha pro-posals involved an additional expenditure of  2,250,000 perannum, and that the grant of the weekly bonuses now proposed would inevitably mean an increase in all other pensions,which would mean in the end an additional char.go ofi:7,000,000 or  8,000,000 in all on the Exchequer.-1-
The Cabinet ware also reminded that the Britisht scale of pensions was much more generous than that, granted in any other European country, and that the totally dis-abied man now received a pension of 40/- a week, and gener-ally an additional allowance which might be as much as 20/-a week.While it was generally felt that in the present state of the national finances it weuld be most difficultto make the concessions proposed, it was urged that themost serious problem at the present time was presented bythe unemployed ex-Servioe man who had exhausted his donationbenefit and who might constitute next winter a real danger to the State.    It was also urged that the case of thepartially disabled man wh* was unemployed was also deservingof very oareful consideration, and it was represented thatin these latter oases the best solution would be to persuadeeach locality to make provision for its own partiallydisabled men.Ultimately the Cabinet agreedTo reject the proposals new before themfor the grant of bonuses to war pensions,on the understanding that the question might be open to further considerationafter the re&amp;eipt of the Report of SirL. Worthington Evans&apos;  Committee onU nemp 1 oymen t.&apos;ALLOWANCES POR     (2) With reference to Cabinet 40 (20), Conclusion 4,PINOLE MENPDERGfING     the Cabinet had under consideration a proposal contained inPAINING WHOHAVE DEPEND- the concluding paragraph of a Memorandum by the MinisterpNT RELATIVES.of Labour (Paper C. p. -1046) that the suggestion containedin his Memorandum (Paper C.P.-150B) regarding payment of adependant&apos;s allowance in respect of a widowed motherdependent upon an ex-Servioe man who is in training whilstliving at home, should be favourably re-considered.    TheCabinet were reminded that on a previous occasion when thismatter was before them it had been represented that; in vie?of the particular hardship involved in these oases, an
allowance should he granted in respect or a depindent( widowed mother oi&apos; lb/- per week, hut that an adverse decisionhad then been given.After sous discussion, the Cabinet agreed (theMinister of Labour dissenting) - To re-affirm the previous decision(Cabinet 40 (20) Conclusion 4) re-Jecting this proposal.-op-work (3) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theiation.Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-1865) relative to the paymentof Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Benefit in theevent of a coal strike.The Memorandum referred to the arrangements approvedby the Cabinet in February last (Cabinet 11 (20), conclusion) and represented that these arrangements should be adopted on the present occasion, subject to the minor modificationthat ex-Service men and women who might be unemployed beforethe commencement if the strike and entitled under their original donation policy to a higher rate of donation than20/- per week or to allowances for dependent children, or both, should ooirtinue to receive them.It was pointed out that to pay in such cases a flat20/- rate during the emergency would mean reduction in therate of the donation as compared with the amount these personwere previously drawing, and which, apart from the emergency,thay would have continued to draw.In order to facilitate acb-dnisti-ation and to simplify the procedure, it was proposed to pay during the emergencyperiod a flat rate of donation (20/- men, 15/- women, the lowest rates now operating:) in ail except speoial ex-Servicecases referred to above.It was generally agreed that, having regard topledgss already given, it would be most difficult to withholdOut-of-Work Donation on the lines proposed, and it was ex-plained by the Minister of Labour that in the case of the-3-
non-Service men the intention was to charge tho 11/- a week to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.Some discussion took place as to the desirabilityor otherwise Of applying the proposals to Ireland, and itwas pointed tut that great difficulties might arise in thecase of the men employed in the shipyards in Belfast ifIreland was excluded from the scheme.Ultimately it was agreed  (a) To approve, so fair aa Great britain was concerned, the proposals contain-ed in the Minister of labour&apos;s Memoran-durn (Paper CP.-1865), a summary ofwhich proposals is attached (See Appendix l).(b) That the Minister of Labour should consult the Irish Secretary on thequestion of the application of theproposals to Ireland, with liberty,without again approaching the Cabinet,to apply the proposals to Ireland inthe event of the Irish Secretary raisingno objection.(4) With reference to War Cabinet 635, Minute 9, theCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (Paper G.P.-1776) showing that the number of motor cars used for official purposes by Departments otherthan the Fighting Departments had been reduced since thedate of the War Cabinet decision from 70 to 13.    The totalcost of running these 13 cars, excluding depreciation and interest on capital for the last four weeks of July amountedto  672.It was urged, on grounds of economy and convenience,that the pool of 13 cars should now be disbanded (except twooars to be retained for a period not exceeding three monthsf or the purpose of long-distance inspections), all vehiclesto be handed over to the Disposal Board lor sale, and that 1future Departments should make use of taxi-oabs for any official journeys required to be made by car in the london district, subject to any special arrangements for individual departments which the Ministry of Transport, with the conserof the Treasury, may make.
1 9, 61,&apos;ITTEE.It was proposed that special arrangements should. he made by the Ministry of Transport with a view to hiring,at reasonable rates, suitable oars for future long-distanceinspection.The Cabinet approved the proposals contained in the Minister of TransportMemo r and urn (Paper C tP.-1776).(5) With reference to Cabinet 43 (20), Conclusion 6,approving certain recommendations cf the Housing Committee,the Cabinet took note of the attached extracts from theMinutes of the 8th Meeting of the Committee (See Appendix IlVIt was generally agreed that the results of thenegotiations with the employers and workmen were profoundlydisappointing, and that unless some drastic measures were adopted no real progress in regard to settlement of thehousing question was possible.    While it was generally agreed that the present was an Inopportune moment for theState to interfere, it was represented that the most promisingsolution of the housing; difficulties lay in the Office ofWork3 taking into employment numbers of ex-Service men andemploying them on building.    This would, no doubt, mean astrike in the building trade, but such a strike would have tobe faced and would not at all events have serious effects on other trades.It was explained that the Housing Committee did not recommend the adoption, of this course, because it was thoughtthat the proposals for the apprenticeship scheme might giveemployment to as many as 20,000 ex-Service men, and that ifthe employers and workpeople would adopt and work thisscheme, time for a fair trial should be given to it.    It was thought verv unlikely that the workmen would accept theproposals.The Cabinet agreed -To resume further consideration ofthe question after the coal crisis.
6.      The atd^jrrtJLon erf&quot; the Onbineivwas--drawn -as -a matter cfur^anr^ to a large order giver, by M, Krassin for cloth.Authentic information was adduced to show that this clothwas required for tho manufacburoof military uniforms forthe Bolshevik Army, and that l\. Krassin was very anxiousto obtain large quantities of cloth with the earliestpossible delivery regardless of cost.     Comment was madeon the undesirability 4f opening trade relations v/ith theBolshevik Government by supplying uniforms for troops,who might oven be employed against British troops in persia *r elsewhere.During an adjournment of this subject enquiries weremade as to the state of employment in the woollen Industry,and it was established that there was no serious unemploy-ment at present.The Cabinet were reminded that before the war thopractice had been to permit the sale of goods, includingeven war material, to anyone who would pay, whether abelligerent or not.      It was pointed oxtt, however, thatto sell military material to Soviet Russia would be incun-slatent with cur general policy of making peace In the Pant.In this connection the attention of the Cabinet was directed to a memorandum by the Secretary of State for &quot;ar(CP. 1866) respecting the despatch of certain military stores which had. been given to the Polos under the authorityof the war Cabinet decision he. 631(4).      It was generally agreed that in this matter- the sane treatment should b*accorded to the Poles as to Russia, and that if it wasdecided to prevent the export to Russia of the cloth,similar restrictions should bo placed on the Polishmi1itary stores.In vie&quot; of certain indications that the Russia trade delegation might be recalled to Russia at an early date,
it was a greed  , (a) To postpone a decision on both pointsc for&apos;the present:(b) That the President of the Board of trade should ascertain and report to the Cabinetall the facts as to the contract for thesupply of clith to Soviet Russia, and moreparticularly any information bearing onthe question of whether it was Intended tobe used for the manufacture of militaryuniforms for the forces of Soviet Russia.lAL CRISIS. (7) With reference to Cabinet 50 (20), Conclusion 15, thePrime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had just reoeiveda message to the effect that at the meeting of Miners&apos;Delegates that morning Mr Smillie had reported that in theview of the men&apos;s leaders nothing had emerged from the nago-tiations with the President of the Board of Trade which prevented the putting into effect of the strike notices as originally contemplated.    Sectional meetings of the delegates were now being held, presumably with a view to ascertaining the strength of local feeling in favour of a strike.It was unanimously agreed that the Government were ina very strong position, and that the country as a -wholeentirely approved the attitude which has been taken upthroughout the negotiations by the President of the Boardof Trade-.ElNS.(ft) With reference to Cabinet 50 (20), Conclusion 1.0,the Cabinet were informed that the Secretary had receivedttish Repre-pation at   a letter from Mr Balfour agreeing to accept the post offeting of *Assembly. Principal British Delegate at the meeting of the Assembly ofthe League of Nations, and expressing concurrence in theproposed appointment of Lord Grey of Pallodon and Mr Barnesas his colleagues.    In his letter, however, Mr Balfour hadreoalled that the British Government, although entitled to three representatives , would have only one vote at the
1S3Assembly.    While assuming that the Government representativewould always have the right to *ast that vote in the probablyrare cases where a vote was taken, and while expressingconfidence that no difference of opinion was likely to arise between Lord Grey, Mr Barnes and himself, Mr Balfour had pointed out the inconvenience which might arise if at anytime the unofficial British representatives should take adifferent view from that of the Government1s representative.It was agreed  That the Prime Minister should approachLord Grey and Mr Barnes with a view to ascertaining whether they would be pre-pared to act as second and third british delegates at the meeting of the Assemblyof the League of Nations.I, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,September 21, 1920.-3-

REVISED PROPOSALS FOR INCREASING BUILDING LABOUR.

The Committee had before them the revised proposals of the Government in regard to the increase of building labour, in the form of a letter addressed by the Ministry of Health to the Resettlement Committee of the Building Industrial Council (H.C. 35), together with a reply of  the Resettlement Committee (H.C.33). The Chairman explained that the original proposals of the Housing Committee, as approved by the Cabinet, had been considered at a Conference with the Resettlement Committee at the Board of Trade on August 17th, but the Resettlement Committee had been unable to agree to them, and in consequence the revised proposals had been put forward by the Government.

APPRENTICESHIP SCHEME FOR EX-SERVICE MEN.

The Resettlement Committee were prepared to accept the now proposals in so far only that they would agree to a system of adult apprenticeship under which ex-service man between the ages 19 and 26 would be admitted to apprenticeship at a wage of 50% of a full journeyman&apos;s wage. This was the only concession the trade were prepared to make in return for the Government&apos;s offer of a guaranteed week. They would not agree to any proposals for payment by results, nor would they agree to the employment of unskilled labour on elementary building work. The Chairman pointed out to the Committee that the proposals amounted to very little in substance,  and it was for the Committee to decide whether they were worth acceptance by the Government. If the Government did not think them adequate, the only alternative was for the Office of Work to engage ex-service men, and proceed without regard to the Trade Union Rules. It was stated on behalf of the Ministry of Health that the apprenticeship offer would be sufficiently attractive to induce a large number of ex-service to come in, but considerable doubt was felt as to the proportion of apprentices to skilled men to which the individual Trades
Unienn would agme-    The i.esettlem*nt CcmmittGo had saidthat they ocntexpiated a propc-rticn of 1 in 4 as an averagethroughout tho trade- which might moon 1 in 3 in special casos-Nc figure was moll tinned    in tho report cf tho ResettlementCentral ttoo, which stated that the Ccamittoo folt that thematter should bo settled by negotiation between employai sand operatives, rather than by any huxd ur.d fast prepcrticn.pfS, In tho opinion cf tho ministry cf Health tho realreason it had boon Impossible to secure an agreement en thovjuosti^n of payment    by results was that the; employ old as wellas the men were doing so well under existing condition^, thatthere was no inducement fcr tho former to scjk u quarrel withimprobablelabour over this question, and it was * that theGovernment would have tho support cf the employers in theevent of issue being joined on this.VSSK. Tho offer cf tho Guvorrmont of a guaranteed week was net worth nearly sc much tc the men as had boon supposed,inasmuch as tho guaranteed week was already in operationpractically all ever the country in cno form or another,   Em-plcyars hud boon abligod to grant it In order to keep hhoirmen.    Under the terms of tho R settlement C*.--mmittoo; c reply,tha Government would merely agree to the principle of the guaranteed week, leaving tho details tc be negotiated be-twoen tho employ ors and men.The- Committee agreod(I) T&apos;. -request the Ministry of Health, in consultationwith the Chairman, tc writo to the R-settlementC&apos;rnmitteo cf the Building Industrial Council, that(1) the Government while prepared to accopttho terms set out in the reply  of the Resettlement Committee,so far ac iN;y went were much disappointed rt themeagre results cf the negotiations and very muchregretted that that Commit-too had net seen the:.?, waytc go any further,  (2) that tho Government mast net beregarded 0.3 being content with the prep-sale,  an Idesired it to bo undorstood that they hold themselvesentirely free to press fcr an extension cf erode Unionrules, where ever and when over they thought fit.(&amp;) Tc instruct the Secretary to report the abovo decisiontc tho Ca cabinet fcr thoir information.shall Gardens, S.W.3 september 1920.
