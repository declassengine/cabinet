,*,HBISHQP (1) With reference to a Conference of Ministers held onJuly  3,, 192-0j... the question was raised of the arrival ofArchbishop Mannix in this country..  The Cabinet was informedthat&apos; instructions had already been issued to stop Atlantic-liners calling at Queenstown, so that the Archbishop^ whenhe arrived, would probably land at Southampton.    It was stated thats although all possible precautions would be taken,It was impossible to give an absolute guarantee that the-police could prevent the Archbishop escaping their vigilanceand c-ossIut to Ireland.    If such an attempt- was - successful,,it was suggested that the whole authority of the Crown shouldbe used to effect his arrest and deportation.    It was pointedout,, however, that this might involve bloodshed.    A suggestionwag made that the seditious speeches already delivered by the archbishop might be an offence against the Grown for which hecould be arrested immediately on his arrival in this country.Doubts as to the wisdom of such a. course were expressed, how-ever,  owing to - (a) the fact that the Archbishop would beable to obtain bail, and (b) that a long-drawn-out trialwould be the inevitable result.The Cabinet agreed --(a) That, should Archbishop llannix succeed inlanding in Ireland, the Irish Executiveshould take any step necessary to arrestand deport him:(b) That the Home Secretary should take stepsformally to warn Archbishop Mannix, throughthe Chief Officer of the &quot;BALTIC*, that hewould not be allowed to land in Ireland:(c) That the Law Officers of the Crown should examine the speeches- cf Archbishop Mannixand ascertain whether they contained anythingof a nature which would admit of his prose-cution in this country or by the australian government,
