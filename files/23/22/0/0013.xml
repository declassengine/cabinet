The attention of the Cabinet was called to amemorandum by the General Staff entitled&quot;reinforcements for Mesopotamia&quot;, which contained a scheme for co-operation by the Dominions in order to relieve the strain on the Imperial Government In supplying white garrisonsabroad d\a*ing the present trouble In Mesopotamia andin Persia (CP. 1843) .In this connection, attention was called to atelegram from the Government of India circulated bythe Secretary of State for India., calling attention tothe difficulties and danger anticipated from the con-tinued employment of Indian troops outside India (CP. 184^The suggestion was made that the Dominions might bemore    filling to supply garrisons In Palestine than else-wherej    and the Chief of the Imperial General staff stated that the v;ar Office would be glad to receive re-Inforcements of a. brigade or even a battalion.Stress was laid on the possibility of obtainingCanadian troopst particularly for service in the PestIndies *The proposal that the Dominions troops should bemaintained at Imperial expense was criticised as a departure from the general orinciole adopted during thewas0 that the Dominions should pay for such co-operation as they could piive,The Cab inet a^resd:-That the Secretary of Stote for theColonies should send a personal and confidential communication to .the governors-General of the Dominions,In which he should ask them to aseer-tain how the proposal would be received,but that in doing so he should makeit clear that the Cabinet was not committed to the proposal.-A-
MINISTRY OF FOOD EMERGENCY SCHEMES

4. The Cabinet had under consideration a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.1851) covering two notes by Sir Hardman Lever,  relative  to the incidence of abnormal  transport cost under the Ministry of Food Emergency Schemes, together with the Chancellor&apos;s Minute to Sir Hardman thereon. It was represented that, in the event of a strike, it was the business of the Government to secure that the public received supplies of food, but not that the excess cost of transporting those supplies should be borne by the Treasury rather than  the consumer; and it was pointed out that in this matter the Supply and Transport Committee, at their meeting on 15th January 1920 had overruled the finance Sub-Committee which had re-commended that the consumer should pay tho extra cost, save in the case of controlled food stuffs. On the other hand, it was pointed out that at the time of the last strike the Government had succeeded largely because it had been able to supply the public with food at prices ordinarily payable. Moreover, there were great practical difficulties in calculating the extra cost of transport, and there was a further difficulty that, if the prices were once increased, it would be most difficult after the strike to get them reduced again and the Government might consequently find itself involved in charges of encouraging profiteering.

It was also represented that all the arrangements for meeting the threatened coal strike had been made on the basis of the Supply and Transport Committee&apos;s decision, and that it would be most difficult to distinguish between goods actually in stock and those which had to be transported. Ultimately it was agreed:-

To confirm the decision of the Supply and Transport Committee, that in the event of a strike the excess cost occasioned by public supplementary transport services should be borne by the Exchequer.

OF j5.  Y7ith reference to the Conference of ; Inistcrs ofIrxisHSeptember 10th 1920, Conclusion 6, the Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe &apos; xcPequer (0.P.1854) respecting the question ofthe price to be paid for home grown wheat of thisyear&apos;s harvest, w) ich in the view of the Minister ofAgriculture  (C.P.1828) should be a price on a paritywith pricos charged to millers for imported wheat from now until the termination of tie bread subsidy,and should not be the maximum price of 95/- now inoperation *in favour of maintaining the present decisionnamely, that home grown wheat should be subject to themaximum price of 95/-, It was contended that at this price the British farmer was actually receiving a higher price and a higher increase on the pre-war price thanfarmers in any other country.     The wholesale -merchantswere circularising the f annexes advising them not tothresh corn, and It was most essential to contradictthe general idea that farmers would be free from control after the 31st &quot;arch next.      It was imprcbablsthat the control of the flour mills could come to anend until August 1921,      If, however, such controlterminated on the 31st &apos; &quot;arch a most dangerous situation would arise, Inasmuch as tho loaf would be selling atmightl/6d and the British farmers/-     &apos;    bo getting 150/-instead of 95/-.      It might be necessary for the Ministryof Food to take power to protect the consumer by fixingmaximum prices for broad, though no doubt competitionwould do something to keep down the price.On the other hand, it was pointed out that gravedissatisfaction would bo expressed by the farmers when
next week in donsequenoe of the action of the Wheat Commission-&apos;&quot;the millers would be paying 118/-S. for foreign wheat, asagainst the 95/-3. maximum for home grown wheat.   There would undoubtedly be a great deal of hoarding, pertly due to re-seataaent and partly to the hope of a higher price next Spring.This in turn would render it necessary for the Wheat Commis-sion to puihhasefrom abroad at the top of the market, to make up for the deficiency,, with most detrimental consequences tothe foreign exchanges.    There was at present a tendency togive up wheat  ooar&amp;tig^- because, wheat was the one cereal whichthe Government continued to control, though no doubt other factors such &amp;s bad weather, labour difficulties,  etc. allcontributed to the decreased wheat acreage.   Nevertheless,the farmer tos most suspicious&quot; that the Government was onlygiving him a free market next year because they thought thatthe price cf wheel was going to fall.inopportune moment to make the announcement desired by theMinister of Agriculture,  and after some further discussion -At the request of the Prime Minister, the Ministerof Agriculture, the Minister of Food and Lord Crawford drafteda cojmnunlcation to be made to the Press on the subjectof the price of home grown wheat after the termination ofthe bread subsidy, at the end of the present financial year.A copy of the notice as drafted end approved by the cabinet is attached.

1 o! APPENDIX__X. to Cabinet 51 , (?0) Minute 5rFor Circulation in Thursday Morning&apos;s Press.In the communication which Mr. Kameneff has thought fit to address to certain Members of Parliament for the purpose of publication, certain statements are -&apos;iade ostensibly &quot;in order toprevent British public opinion from being deceived,&quot; but in factexpressly devised to deceive it.(1).    Mr* Kameneff. after stating that Mr. Lloyd George hadnocused him of participating in the realisation of Russian jewelsin this country, observes &quot;I had no thing to do with ^ny realise-tion of jewels,&quot;     The Government has evidence that Mr * Kameneffwf*s cognisant of the sale of jewels in this countryj    that he informed his Government that  40,000 ^vorth of stones had, in fact,been sold and that the proceeds had been paid over to the &quot;DailyHern Id&quot;j    and, further, that he  was taking steps to procure afurther sum of about  60,000 pnrtly out of the sale of jewels ofv?hlch an additional  10,000 was to be paid to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,So far from Mr. Kameneff having had nothing to do with anyrealisation of jewels, he was actively concerned with the tran-sflctiorJ and took pains to report it to his Government;( )*    Mr * Kameneff observes &quot;neither in my capacity as president of the Russian Delegation, nor as a private individual,have I ever given or offered any subsidy either to the &quot;daily herald&quot; or other newspaper whatsoever, or to any editor or pro-p^ieior of jir.y newspaper*?fSimilarly on the 20th August tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, after theTfiroless telegrams had been published showing its relations withthe Soviet Government, declared that It had received &quot;not abond, not a franc, not a rouble M&apos;     The Government has evidence/which
which flatly contradicts both these statements;    before thatdote diamonds which wore brought ever by the Russian delegation were sold in London for between  40,000 and  50,000, great carebeing taken that the transaction should not pass through anybank account but that bank notes should be received in payment.On the 10th September the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; astonished Itsreaders by suddenly asking the question:    &quot;Shall we take  75,000of Russian money?&quot; and summed up. in the affirmative *     &quot;Toaccept it*f observes this organ, &quot;will be to complete a notableepisode in international socialism.     Tho episode will indeed be notable*M     It is stated in the article that not gold, butan offer of gol&amp;, had been received by Mr. Francis Meynell, a director of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; who was stated to have actedabsolutely on his own Initiative in the matter.   The Governmenthas evidence that these statements are incorrect, that llr-Bdgar1* ana bury, the son of Mr- George Lansbury tho Editor of the paper had in fact received part cf the notes given for the jewels.The &apos;M)any Herald&quot; proceeds to imply that the money whichhad thus boon offered was slowly collected in Russia;    that itwas to be held In trust for the Third International, and to be offered to the &apos;T)any Herald&quot; if the need arose, and it pretendsthat before receiving any of tho money tho editor wished totake the opinions of his readers.     The Government has completeevidence that, so far from this sum having been slowly collected in Russia, tho greater part of it was realise&apos;!, very promptlyby the sale of precious stones in London.Some of the innocent readers of the &quot;Daily Herald&apos;&quot; have written/ &quot;**
written to it in answer to its question. &quot;Shall no take 75,000 of Russian money?&quot;, expressing surprise thatthe  cp.estion was asked.     There is no mystery here.It is easy to explain why the question is asked and why it was asked on September 10th,      The enquiry in the &quot;daily herald&quot; was published on September 10th, because Mr.EdgarLansbury had been Interviewed by the Police just beforeand asked to c: plain why he had had possession of someof the notes which formed part of the price realised bythe sale of the Russian jewels.     The Government permitsitself to doubt whether the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; would havetaken the public Into its confidence with respect to theRussian money but for the fact that It had been   apprisedthat the secret could no longer be kept.(3)&apos;,     Mr. Kameneff truthfully observes that the PrimeMinister charged him with having incorrectly transmittedthe Russian conditions for the Armistice v/ith Poland,Mr, Kameneff does not attempt to deny that he did Ineffect deliberately alter the terms of the despatch whichhe had received from his Government containing the funda-- mental conditions of the Armistice to be proposed to poland.      The Russian Soviet Government had, made it plainto Mr, Kameneff that they would Aatelst :on tho arming ofthe Polish workers under the control of representativesof the Trade Unions of Russia,  Poland and Norway.1-Mp. Kameneff, who realised that such a condition would bounacceptable in this country as cut of harmony with theprinciples of British Trade Unionists and destructive ofthe Independence Of the Polos,  concealed, the intentions of/
his Government-amde.r--the&apos;-apuarently-hej?mless phrase of a&quot;Civic Militia&quot;.(4)*      The Government greatly regret that it has beenfound necessary to bring these facts to the public notice,but the evidence that Mr. Kameneff has violated the pledge which he gave to His Majesty1s Government to abstain from active propaganda,  direct or Indirect, in&quot;this country. Is so overwhelming, and the apology whichhe has Issued to the Press is so misleading; that theyare left with no alternative *.10, Downing Street, S.&quot;.!.15th September 1920.
RUHOURSD HOARD IHG OF 47IG3ATThe Pood Controller!3 attention has been directed tocertain notices and circulars issued to farmers advising themthat after March 31 next the price obtainable for home-grown wheat harvested this year will probably be in excess of thepresent authorised maximum of 95/- per 504 lb./or that price control will be discontinued after that date.It is desired to emphasise the fact that the adviceas given does nv*t proceed  Tom any Government Department and is wholly unauthorised and misleading.      There is no change in thepolicy of the Government as announced by the Prime minister in the House of Commons on March 11 last, whereby the pricte ofhome-grown wheat of sound milling quality harvested in 1920is limited to 95/- per quarter of 504 lb.Ministry of FoodSeptember 16th 1920*

1tXSEKS3 (1) The Conference-Jha  tuodjex- o^&amp;sJjierfetAon a MajBOxandnm.by the President of the Bdard of Trade (Paper CP.-1652) inwhidh the Cabinet were recommended to refuse the claims of theminers that the price of domestic   coal ibhould be reducedby 14s, 2d. a ton and that an increase should be granted inthe wages of miners of 2/- per shifts   * meeting between thePresident ef the Board of Trade and the miners  Representa-tives had been arranged to take place that afternoon, and adecision of policy was therefore urgently required.It was explained that the total cost of the miners&apos;proposals would be  83,000,000 per annum, and the minersargued that this should be met out of the profit of  66,000,000en the price of exported coal.It v-as pointed out that since the Sankey Award wagesincreases had more than compensated for the advance in the06st of living, but In addition to this the miners derived aconsiderable  advantage in getting their coal either for no-thing &amp;r at a privileged price,    Moreover,  the miners hadreceived larger advances since 1914 than any othor trade exceptbuilders and railwaymen*    To accede to their claims wouldamoisgit to sver-ruling the  decision of the Industrial Courtupen the reoent claim of the engineers^ and would inevitably be followed by a new wage cycle.    On the other hand, theGovernment were in a better position to meet a strike at thepresent moment than they had been throughout the War.    TheRailway, Gas and Electrical Companies, had sufficient stocks to keep in full running for six weeks.    It was doubtfulwhether the miners In fact intended to strike, but on theassumption that they would do so the Government had a very good case to put to the public.    In the view of the Board ofTrade, the profits on the export of coal should be handedever to the Exchequer.   The coal trade was the &amp;nly one- 1 -
in respect of which no Excess Profits Duty was paid, since in point of fact all the profits in the coal trade  up to the present time had been used to subsidise the British consumer. It was estimated that if control were removed and prices allowed to assume their economic level, there would be a contribution to the Exchequer, in the form of Excess Profits Duty, of  110,000,000 on a conservative estimate, and it was therefore only right that the profit on exported coal (£66,000,,000)  should be handed over to the Treasury.

The Conference agreed:-

To authorise the President of the Board of Trade to refuse the minors&apos; claims.

?

(2) The Conference had under consideration the represent tion of the British Government at the forthcoming meeting which was to take place at Geneva to discuss reparation with the Germans.

It was agreed:-

That the British Government should be represented by:-

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Laming Worthington Evans, Lord. D&apos;Abernon.

Some discussion took place on a suggestion that the meeting with the Germans should be attended by the Reparation Commission. It was pointed out that the latter being a judicial body it would be a matter of some embarrassment if they were formally brought into the negotiations as a corporate body.

It was agreed;-

That it was undesirable that the Reparation Commission should attend the negotiations with the German experts, and that it was preferable that the Allied representatives should prepare their own recommendations on the German proposals, and submit them to the Reparation Commission for examination.

? Negotiations with the Soviet Government.

(3)The Conference had under consideration Foreign Office Telegram No.170 dated 24th July from the Soviet Government had reversed their previous decision and were prepared to come to
London to discuss with representives of the leading Powers of the Entente, a&apos; general basis of peace between Russia" and the other Powers which participate in hostile actions against her, or support such,"

(a)The Conference agreed:-

(i)The draft of a reply welcoming the decision of the Soviet Government to enter into peace negotiations in  London and concurred in the proposal that the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should proceed to Boulogne to discuss the matter with H. Millerand on tho following day:-

(ii)That tho Prime Minister should he accompanied by Sir Laming Worthington Evans, for the purpose of discussing tho Coal question with the French Government.

(iii)The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to forward copies of the reply to the Soviet Government of the Governments of Finland, Roumania, and Czecho-Slovakia.

(b)The Conference agreed:-

That the Prime Minister should see the representative in London of General Wrangel, and explain to him that we did not approve of the offensive undertaken by General Wrangol, that once the Armistice was concluded with the Poles his position would be extremely precarious, and that in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, General Wrangel should, on grounds of humanity, not reject the offer of the Soviet Government.


REFUSAL OF IRISH RAILWAYMEN TO CARRY POLICE, ETC.

(4)With reference to the Conference of Ministers held on Friday 23rd July 1920, the Conference had before them a Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland (C.P.1657), together with a Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.1671), relating to the refusal of Irish Railwayman to carry soldiers, police and munitions on the railways.

It was stated that traffic had been tendered to the railways in the ordinary course and as a result of the refusal of a number of railwayman to work the trains, a certain number of men had been dismissed: this had resulted in partial dislocation. The matter had been brought to a head by a letter written by the Chairman of the Great Northern Railway Company to the Chief Secretary (attached as Appendix to C.P.1657) in which it was stated that the company protested against an indefinite continuance of the existing state of affairs and suggesting that the Government should formally intimate to the Irish railways that they (the Government) could not continue to contribute to the wages of men who refused to handle military traffic and that the companies must obtain an understanding from their men to work all traffic and to give notice to terminate the services of such men as refused.

It was stated that the suggestion of the railway companies would entail negotiation with the leaders of the men and that the leaders would have to answer for tho men as to whether they wore willing to undortake the working of trains on which military or police etc., were on board, and it was suggested that affairs might be more quickly brought to an issue if it could be arranged for a whole series of trains to/
to have either police munitions or troops on board and then if the railwaymen refused to work the trains they should he instantly dismissed.

The Conference agreed-

That the Minister of Transport in consultation with the Chief Secretary should send a letter to the Irish Railways, making it clear that any refusal to carry Government traffic was to he vigorously dealt with. 

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN IRELAND

(b) With reference to Cabinet 31(20) Conclusion 2(a) the Conference had before thom a Memorandum by the Chief Secretary covering a draft Bill providing for the immediate extension of the jurisdiction of courts martial in Ireland (C.P.1682) superseding the Draft Criminal Justice Administration (Ireland) Bill (C.P.1437). It was stated that the object of the former was to bring all criminal offences under the jurisdiction of a court martial. It was not proposed to supersede the ordinary courts which would continue their functions, but the Bill gave power to bring all criminal offences under a court, martial established by law and gave it power to impose the death penalty.

It was stated that courts martial were now functioning every day in Ireland and wore not unsuccessful, but the Defence of the Roalm Act under which they worked did not allow the Inclusion of all criminal offences vuithin their jurisdiction. A suggestion was made that while it was necessary to substitute some Instrument to place the place of the present jury system in Ireland, obtainable by using the machinery of the Defence of the Realm not, yet it was a decision of the graveat moment to utilize machinery intended for time of war in time of peace, and considerable/

anxiety
1 q n1 o uwas. expressed at thus haniioog^&apos;v^r-d^^^of the 1 abo sold!er s ,It was pointed outre however, that under the proposed bill the -discretion of setting, up a court martial was underthe authority cf the Lord Lieutenant, though the compos Itian-ofa court martial would be decided r.pcn by the-Corwrander^ibn^^Glaiei&apos;or ether competent military authority.It was stated that whilst come advantage might beobtained in the L.-rcl TI out e.cant having to decide in whatdistrict a eaurtynartial should be formally declared, yetit was n&amp;t clear from the proposed Bill that such a proceedingwould only be made use of in the disturbed areas.    Further, in viewof the extreme step suggested of handing over the whale adminis-tration of justice to the military it might be better to associatein some form or another a competent civilian legal expertwith this military jurisdiction,General--agre-ement-was expressed with this view and itwas thought that the Army (Courts of Enquiry) Act 1916    affordedina suitable precedent-      This Act itobled/all trials  in which a civilian was involved for a legal civilian expert to be associatedwith the Military administration of the law.    It was suggestedthat it might be desiralole tr. have available a small panel ofsuch experts who could he drawn upon by the President       acourt martial in any district to assist him in administering thelaw.The Conference were informed that the Criminal Injuries(Ireland) Bill (CP.1590), providing for the interception ofmonies payable to Irish local authorities and the use if suchmonies in compensation for criminal injuries had been Introduced
1 Q -into the House of Commons and that everx^puhdJ^^swtiMrltyhad been notified that no public money would be paid tothem unless they agreed to accept the audit of theIrish Local Government Board   and nbide by statutory RUlasjkgtti&amp;titns. Paymerrts due in respect of old Age Pensions,however, would not be withheld on the groundthat they were to be used for compensating criminal  injuries,but it was desirable that they should be stopped in viewof the frequent robberies which had taken place, and onthe ground that the cessation of the railways would render the transmission of money diffioult.It was pointed out that with the limited time avail-able and for Parliamentary reasons it was most desirablethat any government measures affecting Ireland should be dealtwith as shortly as possible and in one Bill, and It wassuggested that use should be made of the system of orders in Council so that the Bill in question would merely give general powers, and all details would be dealt with by orders in Council.    It would then be possible to Include in one com-preneriwjive Bill the provisions of the Criminal Injuries(Ireland) Bill (CP.1590), of the draft Bill attached tothe Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland (CP.1682),and the further powers which were now desired by the irish executive, such as the power tc change the venue of a trialfrom Ireland to England.The Conference agreed(1)    That the Chief Secretary for Ireland shouldtake steps to withdraw the Criminal Injuries(Ireland) Bill (CP.1590) from the House ofCommons j(2)    That the Chief Secretary for Ireland should draft a new Bill relating to Ireland; this bill to be as brief as possible and toprovide for -(a)    the extension in Ireland of theDefence of the Realm Regu3ations toall crimes w tb the nrovi^o that the punishment f%       the punishmentassigned by tn.6 ordinary law.&quot;
if(b) The enactment by Order in Councilof provisions incidents   to theextension of the  jurisdiction of courts martial including the creating of newoffences.-(c) The interception of all grants asproposed in the Criminal Injuries Bill.(3)     That each Oourt established to deal witheases triad under the Defence of the healmiiegulations should contain one eivilian legalmember of experience,  in all eases of a very grave character which might possibly involve the death penalty.^itehall Gardens,  S.Yy.l.,26th July,  1920.

(l) The Conference had before then the draft of anOrder forwarded to the Lord Privy Seal by the Admiraltydesigned to prohibit ships carrying passengers eastwardbound from entering ^ueonstown Harbour until further notice( C .P.  184-5) .The Co nf e r - n ce agre od: -That the Admiralty should bo authorised toissue the Order and to make such communica-tions to the Foreign Office as might benecessary with a view to notifyingWashington, and to other government offices concerned.
1 b I&quot;;pUSSXAH (2)     Pith reference to Conclusion (1) of the Confer onceTRADEPOLECAT ION. of Ministers of September 8th. the Conference had beforethem a letter dated 9th September 1920 addressed by M.Kameneff to the Prime Minister stating that he proposedto leave London on Saturday next and to stay in Moscow notmore than seven days,      !!. Hareneff asked for instructions and offered to put before his Government any suggestion for the speedy establishment of a general peace and agreement with England which remained the sincere desire of tho Russian Government (c.pv1c40).A Suggestion was made that tho proper course would befor the Prime Minister to send for M, Mamaneff and toInform him that the British Government were prepared tocontinue negotiations only on the following conditions:&quot;(1)    That the Government of Russia should do what every man cf honour does - abide by their principles.(2)    That they should send, a nan of honour torepresent them Instead of      Eameneffwho had deceived the British Governmentin regard to the terms to he offered to the Poles at   Minsk&quot;,  tIt was pointed out that if M, Kamaneff was not allowed to return it would be difficult to retaincertain other members of the Mission who were equallyculpable including M. Klischko.     Without the latterit was improbable that M. Krassin and the more honourablemembers of the Mission would be allowed, to stay.     hence the resaalt would be that the door would be closed to thetrade negotiations which at present&quot;held out some prospects of useful results *Attention was drawn to an article In the.  &quot;daily herald&quot;&apos; admitting and. attempting to justify relationswith the Russian Trade Delegation in regard tc the rooigt
2,r.       Lord Hardinge called the attention of the conference to the unsatisfactory position of English prisoners inRussia and Baku.      There were some 1^0 scattered overP.ugsia inc 1 ud.ing 8 5 civi.1 ians,  Chiefly in Koscow andPetrograd,  and about 60 in Baku.      There was evidencethat they were very indifferently fed.     The ForeignOffice were taking all possible steps to relieve theirdistress.Lord Hardinge undertook to. submit to the Prime Minister full particularsfor communi cat ion to 1!. Kameneff that afternoon.of a subsidy from Toviet Russia.    It was pointed outthat this article had doer, published in order to forestallthe publication of the results of Police enquiries whichhad traced the proceeds of jewels sold by the RussianDelegates to Mr.  Francis Meynell, a Director of the &quot;daily herald&quot;.      Some emphasis afas placed on the importanceof the fullest possible publicity.After some discussion the Conference agreed:-(l)    That the Prime Minister should see V.Kameneff personally and warn him that his conduct had given rise tosuspicion,  and that the subsequentenquiries had revealed a series ofbreaches of his undertaking of whichthe Prime Minister would give an outline without dealing with theevidence.(2)    That the question of tho publicationof tho evidence should be reserved until rafter this  interview.
LyR 3.    with reference to Kinute 5 of the conference ofIllTATIONHZGA. Ministers held on September 8th the conference had beforethem correspondence between the Prime Minister&apos;s private secretary (Mr. J.T, Davies)  and Mr. H.3. Lindauy onbehalf of the Joint secretaries of the Council ofAction in which it was explained that the purpose ofthe proposed visit by Mr. Adam sj on and Mr. A. A. pure ellto Riga was &quot;To attend the coming negotiations betweenthe Russian and polish peace Delegates and watch theproceeding     (CP.184:?) .The Conference agreed :-That the Prime Mini --ster should send a reply in the -sense that the Cabinethod considered the request and had decided that they could net recognise the right of any body to take part inthe foreign policy of the country which whs exclusively the- business ofthe Government of the country.
?4.TENED       4&quot;.   The president of the Board of Trade gave &quot;the Con-strike.,ference his impression of the meeting he had had on theprevious day with the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federationfrom which it was clear that while the temper of theminors and their representatives was not aggressive the stage had been reached when a strike was very difficultto avert.   There appeared to be considerable risk that therailwayman would join    the strike *    The mere transport cfcoal in the railwaye would be regarded as &quot;black!egging&quot;by the miners and it would be difficult for the railwaymento avoid participation.    The attitude of the transportworkers was less certain.ATBHED 5.   The conference was informed that a dispute hadKB OFTRICIAHS *     ari sen between the Employers and Men in the engineering and Electrical Trades over the appointment of a non-union foreman.   The matter was being referred by theMinistry of Labour to a Court of Enquiry.The Minister asked both parties to call a truce -the E,T.u&quot;. to send their men back to work and the Employers&apos;Federation to Withdraw the lock-out notices pending thereport of the court of Enquiry.    The E.T.TJ. was willing todo this provided the employers withdrew the lock-outnotices.    This,  that body refused to do.The resoliition passed at a meeting of the shop-stewards was reported to the Conference,   This resolutioncalled on the Engineering and National Employers Federa-tion to conform with the recommendation of the Ministryof pabour, failing which the meeting asked their respec-five organisations to give seven days notice- to withdraw their labour.The conference took note of the situation.
6, The Conference had before then a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries pointing out the heavyshrinkage in the area under wheat and the likelihood ofthis shrinkage continuing and urging an immediate cancellation-tion of the maximum price of 95/- and that until the term in a-tion of the bread subsidy,  farmers should receive a price ona parity with the price of imported wheat (CP. 1828).In support of this orbposal it was stated that a nowsituation would arise in about a week &quot;hon the &quot;heat Oomnis-sion would have to announce a now? price of 116/- for imported wheat.    This was necessary in order to reduce the bread subsidy.This announcement,   coming at the moment when farmers were con-si daring what  crops to grow for  next year&apos;s harvest and at atime of trouble for the farrier on account of labour andweather difficulties would, unless the proposed steps woretaken, have the inevitable effect of still further reducingthe area sown to wheat and of  causing the farmers to hoardtheir this year&apos;s harvest of wheat until control was removed.In that event the  cost to the Treasury owing to thenecessity of purchasing a larger quantity of wheat from north america -would be  2,000,000 more than if those proposals were accepted.    Moreover it was contended that the stops proposed would not  increase the price of bread to the consumer at all upto March 31st. and after that data- by less than a farthing.On tho other hand it was contended that the farmerswore getting a fair profit for their wheat and that to admit this principle of an increase-- in tho price of British wheat to thenextlevel of imported wheat would after the 31st March/when thesubsidy disappeared give the farmers unduly large profits at therate of an extra ten  or fifteen million pounds for a year * b crop,m &quot;-rely because tho exchange with foreign wheat-growing countries was so unfavourable to our Government and would bo on a parallel with putting the extra profits on export coal into the- pocketsof the coalowners instead of into the Treasury.
The general view of the Conference was that the presentmoment was unfavourable for the adoption of the proposedsteps.    The principal difficulty at the present moment beinglargely industrial and not with the farmers.it v?ae also pointed out that unless it were made clear that the price of home wheat would be controlled forsome time after the 31st March there would be hoarding andgreat loss to the Treasury.It was suggested that an announcement should be made that control of price would not be removed on the 31stMarch as the faimers were now being advised to hoard in the belief that all control would then be removed.The Conference agreedThat the question raised issues onwhich the Chancellor sf the Exchequermust express his views- tint that no final decision could be taken until these views had been received.Whitehall Gardens, S.v7. 1-10th September, 1920.
