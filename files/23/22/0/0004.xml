(1) With reference to Cabinet 41 (SO), Conclusion 9,the Cabinet.had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (Paper CP.-1676)  covering the Report of the RacesAdvisory Committee on the question op passenger fares..The Cabinet were informed that the problem&apos;consideredby the Rates Advisory Committee was the best, method of raisin/-money at the rate of  72,000,000 per annum which was necessaryto obtain estimated equilibrium by July 31,. 1921.    The amountactually required was  56,000,000 in Great Britain, and nearly 3,000,000 for Ireland.    This additional revenue had to be divided between goods and passenger traffic, and the Commit-tee had to pay  due regard to the cost of the service and tothe rates which in practice could be charged without loss oftraffic, and had to bear in mind a cardinal consideration that railways must not &quot;be subsidised by the State.Turning to the Committee&apos;s proposals, it was explainedthat the addition of ^d. a mile in the case of ordinary third-class tickets, and in other classes 2d- in the 1/-, would produce  10,850,000 by July 31, 1921, and would represent anincrease of 75 per cent,  over the pre-war fare.    Even so, thecoat of. rail service was much below the cost of other trans-port service here or abroad, and of all other staple commodit-ies in comparison with pre-war charges.    In the case of the holiday-maker the increase in the fare was infinitesimalcompared with the increase in other expenses, such as boardand lodging.In the case of workmen&apos;s fares, there had been nouniform incidence and no proper basis in the past, and it was accordingly impossible to make a reasoned percentage addition.In future, the  suggestion was that workmen (who for thispurpose might be  defined as persons travelling third-classbefo-e S a*m.) should be charged the new scale proposed bythe Committee,  subject to the condition that in no case shallthe increase exceed a maximum of 200 per cent.
Season ticket holders would be subjected to a 50 per cent,increase on the rate in force prior to May, 1918, the Commit--tee being unwilling to penalise the bread-winner by -recoiaraend-ihfl! a 1^&apos;-&apos; g e&quot; i no r e a s e .Traders5  Tickets, which had been riven by the RailwayCompanies mainly with the view of attracting goods traffic,should be fixed at 20 per cent, below the season ticket rate.The various proposals were estimated to give the followingfinancial results:-&apos;Ordinary- Ticket s.........-  10, 850. 000Season Tickets  ...........Traders&apos; Tickets..........Workmen&apos;s Tickets   ........Total......This figure  17,350,000 bears a small proportion to the 66,000,000 to be raised in Great Britain., and the differencemust be raised out of goods rates.-   Speaking generally,  theCommittee had felt, that less hardship would be  created by,and less objection taken to, an increase in the goods rates,the cost of which was passed on to the consumer and only feltindirectly, than a direct increase of the individual fare.On behalf of the Ministry of Transport it was urged thatthe recommendations of the Committee should be generally accepted,  subject to one condition:    it would probably befound on investigation that the proposed increase in theworkmen&apos;s fares might,in a  certain limited number of cases,result in hardship to the individual.    The low-grade unskillcworker might conceivably have to pay as much as *3s.6d. per-week additional for his travelling,  and it was suggested thatsympathetic consideration might be extended to cases wherethe existing workmen1s fare today was 6d. or over, and theincrease v-.a over TOO per cent. on that.Ob    y-.was taken to the recommendations of the SatesAdvisory.Commit tee relating to workmen&apos;s fares and seasonticket hoi,, legs, mainly on the ground that the opposition which would be raised would be out of all proportion to theamount  cf money irvolvedf and also because the additions
proposed would aggravate the existing, housing difficulties.The recent outcry in the Press would be revived, this time infavour of the wortoan, and particularly the unskilled employee(both male and female)  on a comparatively low wage.    Withregard to housing schemes 6 to 10 miles out of London,  it waspossible that, workmen&apos;s fare 3 had not existed before in someof the localities, with the result that a SCO per cent, limitwould not apply, and tenants who had taken houses on the sup-position that they would have to pay a similar workmen&apos;a fareto that they had been accustomed to pay would certainly raise a political agitation.Moreover, it was pointed out that a substantial increaseof the present workmen&apos;s fares would aggravate the prevailingdiscontent at the crowded trains and unsatisfactory travellingconditions which now obtained, and it was urged that it wouldbe preferable, if possible, to throw the whole, or at any ratea substantial part, of the increased cost of the workmen&apos;sfa-es on to the goods traffic.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the House ofCommons would certainly object to proposals which involved a raising of all fares except workmen&apos;s fares;    that withouta substantial addition to the workman&apos;s fare the cost of hietransport would not be on an economic basis, and the workmen&apos;representatives who had appeared before the Committee had agreed that the running of workmen&apos;a trains should at all events involve no loss.    Moreover, the Ra*es Advisory Committee had cut the passenger rates as fine as possible., and itwas extremely doubtful whether anything more could be putuoon the Roods rates without exceeding the 100 per cent,increase on those rates contemplated.The Cabinet were also reminded that a decision to leavethe workmen&apos;s fare substantially as at present would resultin drawing into the workmen&apos;s hours of travel a large numberof persons who would otherwise pay the ordinary fare. . Notonlv would this bring serious congestion on the railways,
but it would mean a substantial increase in the amount whiclwould have to be found from other sources.It was again suggested that the proposed sympathetictreatment Of hard cases should meet all reasonable critic isand it;was proposed that the Cabinet should state that wherthe increase on the present workman&apos;s ticket exceeded 6d. aday the case was one for enquiry and sympathetic treatment.Ultimately the Cabinet agreed,.for Great Britain  (a) As regards ordinary tickets, to adopt therecommendation,   of the Rates Advisory Oom-mittoe, viz., that these tickets should be subjected to an increase of 1673 per cent,on the present fares, thus raising the octalfares to 75 per cent, upon the pre-war fares:the increase to be brought into force onA\igust 5,. 1920, .(b) As regards season tickets, to adopt therecommendation of the  Rates Advisory Gom-mittee to increase such fares 50 per cent,on the fares in operation in May, 19IS,  suchincrease to ta,ke effect as from August 1,1920. -(c) As regards workmenfs tickets, to accept inprinciple the recommendation of the PatesAdvisory Committee that workmen&apos;s faresshould be increased,,    Bavins regard, however,to the wide discrepancies at present existing in different districts, and the possibility ofunfairness resulting from the strict applica-tion of a uniform rate of increase, it wasdecided that the Minister of Transport should examine the Committee&apos;s proposals and submittc the Cabinet a full scheme for increasedworkmen&apos;s fares, to take effect as from august 3-1 j,  1930: - such scheme to have  regardteethe special  cases of hardship and to thehousing difficulties referred to above,(d) Tc accent the remaining recommendations ofthe  Pites Advisory Co-rrkttee,  includingthe... . with rega-to  Ireland, the dateson which the increases are brought into00 or at ion to be the same as for GreatBritain.(3) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies  (Paper CP.-1399)covering a d^aft Bill to give effect to the decision ofthe Government to exercise closer supervision over emigra-tion, on the lines recommended by the Dominions  RoyalCommission and the Empire Settlement Committee.

AUSTRALASIAN       MEAT. %DREPORT BY THE POOD CONTROLLER.(?)r        My Department resumed the control of the sale ofsAustralasian meat on the 15th Mayc(1)     STOCKS.    The stock position as on the 15th June is shownin the attached schedule0    There will, of course, have to beadded any further deliveries under the contracts, while it will benoted that there is to be subtracted 22,000 tons lamb sold for direct shipment from New Zealand to North America,,(2)     CONSUMPTION.     The first action taken to stimulate theconsumption was a reduction in the wholesale prices under theauthority of Mim.ite A0    (Note0    Maximum retail prices hadalready been removed at the request of the Board of Trade)cInstead of a flat wholesale price of 9d, per lb,, which had givengreat dissatisfaction to the retailers, prices were graded inaccordance with the value of the meat,, as follows:-New Zealand.     Australian-)Cut Ewes 7d 6*d.  Uncut Ewes 8d 7^dCut Wethers 8d 7*dUncut Wethers 9d 9dLambs remained as hitherto at 13dc per lb.These reductions did not go to the full extent authorised by the Cabinet. but the returns of sales given below show thatthey were effective and secured increased consura.ption0While the reduced price was undoubtedly responsible for a large measure ,of the increase, It was assisted by the fact that during june the home production of meat is at a low ebb. and anincreased demand for imported meat is normal at that timeoConsiderable diminution in this demand must be expected during july;. when the livestock which has been held back for the cessation
of control will come on the markets   The demand for imported meat is likely also to fall to a low level from the middle ofSeptember till the middle of November when the markets will &quot;be full of meat from the grass fed stock.Sales of Imported Meat for consumptionduring April, May and June, 1920,Week ended   Total sales Australas ianTons       Beef and Muttonera Lambo3rd April1 Oth     &quot;17th     &quot;24th     &quot;1st May8th   &quot;15th   &quot;22nd   &quot;(WhitcWk)29th   &quot;5th June12th   &quot;19th   &quot;26th   &quot;14,81412,37613,18214,67512,73116,89918,-34019, 03713^69822,18423,55317,84917,3997,2385,4166,0356,0615,8249,90910,92011,3217,76613,25714,54811,59110,048American7,5766,9607,1478,6146,9076,9907,4207,7165,9328,9279,0056,2587,351Australas ianMutton and lamb only.- - - to o(D r-fri -rl -     ^q oS8,2878,83610,0727,29011,44013,28210,4689,234(3)    CONTINENTAL SALES.   Negotiations were opened with herr Merz on the occasion of his visit on the 1st June when he desired to discuss arrangements for the supply of viieat and other commodities to the German Government. The offer put forward bythe Ministry comprised an offer of some 21.000 tons of north american flour conditional upon the acceptance ^7 the GermanGovernment of 10,000 tons of Chinese bacon and 5,000 tons of american bacon and 2 5,000 tons of Australasian mutton. The muttonwas to be delivered in equal monthly shipments between August and
December and the prices were to be 1-Jd per lb above the wholesale prices at which the meat was being sold in England, to cover thecost of delivery to the ship and freight to Hamburg, The insurancewas to be at the buyer&apos;s risk and the Ministryrs risk was to ceasewhen the meat was put on boards   The terms of payment proposed were from 9-12 months1 credit from the dates of shipment with Q%interest and the re-payment was to be in sterlingsThese negotiations broke down; the grounds put forward by the German Government being twofold?-First;   That they had a difficulty In disposing of their present&quot;Large stocks of meat and fat&quot;, and secondly&apos;; That they were not in a position to buy moat of any kindeven though conditions of paymont were favourableaThe first reason given is entirely at variance with fulland detailed explanations made by Herr-Me-rs to me with regard tothe meat position in Germany *   Ho informed me that substantialimports of meat are essential In the latter part of this year if germany is to maintain her present wholly inadequate ration.I believe that statement to be true, and that the real difficulty with the German Government is the financial difficulty,I am hopeful that as a result of the Spa Conference some avenuetowards the resumption of those negotiations with Germany may befound.The increase in the consumption of Australasian mutton inthis country since the 15th May has been considerably more than Ihad ventured to hope fcr^    The present rate Of consumption is morethan double the consumption of Australasian mutton and lamb in thiscountry before the Tfar; but even this rate of consumption is insufficient to solve the problem of how our great accumulations of mutton are to be disposed of in time to avoid grave Inconvenienceto the colonial producers, and much political friction when the producers will be clamouring for shipping and storage space forthe forthcoming seascncs output?,
About 3,000 tons has been disposed of to Austria and isin process of transport.     Arrangements have been made for asmall quantity to be shipped direct from Australia to Sweden and small quantities are going almost weekly from this country toFrance.(4).      DURATION OF CONTRACTS.      The New Zealand contract termination-nates by agreement on 30th June.     Strong pressure was exercisedfor the extension of this date, but Lord Milner cabled to theGovernor General of New Zealand on 26th May that His Majesty&apos;sGovernmeTx.t-&quot;we-re-unable to depart from the decision conveyed on13th..March that, they were unable to extend the contract beyond30 th June .On the-&apos;28th...June I discussed&quot;&quot;this decision with sir Thomas Mackenzie, representing the New Zealand Government.The result of the interview was intimated to the Under-Secretaryof State for the Colonies in a letter of the same date in thefollowing terms&quot;As a result of the interview, Sir Thomas Mackenzie was authorised&quot;to inform   his Government that the Food Controller was unable to&quot;sanction any extension of the present contract but that he&quot;sympathized very strongly with New Zealand producers in their&quot;difficulties and recognized the necessity of maintaining the&quot;United Kingdom as the principal market for New Zealand meat; that&quot;he was accordingly prepared to facilitate the resumption of&quot;private trading at the earliest possible moment by the allocation&quot;of some definite proportion of tonnage to private shippers subject&quot;only to such conditions as might be necessary to protect the&quot;realization of Government stocks which was now being pressed&quot;forward very urgently.      I am to add that Sir    Thomas Mackenzie&quot;expressed himself satisfied with this intimation.&quot;Lord Milner also cabled on 26th May to the Governor Generalof the Commonwealth of Australia inviting the Australian States toassent, to a definite date for the termination of those contracts,
1st July, 1920.(Sgd)   CHARLES A. MoCURDYsuggesting the 30th September, except in tho case of Queenslandfor which the 30th November was suggested.No reply appears to have been received as yet to this invitation.(5).       PUBLICITY.    The Cabinet authorized a certain expenditureon advertising as a step that would assist in the disposal of the stocks entrusted to the Ministryc    After giving full considerationto the matter it was decided that better results were likely to beachieved by advertising of a less direct nature than displayadvertisements in the newspapers which might endanger subsequentfree publicity.   With this object the newspapers were furnishedfrom time to time with paragraphs to controvert the impression that the Government stocks consisted of inferior meat.   At thesame time the household columns of various papers were used tosuggest to the public recipes for new ways of cooking mutton.The expenditure which has been incurred in this way hasbeen trifling, but there would appear to be some justification forclaiming that It has assisted sales.(6)*       CONGESTION AT PORTS.     As regards delay in unloading meatships which at one period resulted in heavy demurrage, I am glad tobe able to report that there are at present no meat ships awaitingdischarge and that there is vacant cold storage space in all theprincipal ports.(7).       As soon as the transfer was completed, I appointed a Meat(Sales) Committee under the chairmanship of Sir William Mitchell-Thomson, to decide upon the best means of stimulating Increasedsales at home and abroad, and to prepare the periodical report on progress for submission to the Cabinet.    I have received the great-est assistance from this Committee and. attribute the increased consumption largely to its excellent work,

S 5 C B By^h^Tliiaiister of Transport (CP&amp;159S) relative to theposition of controlled canals not owned By RailwayCompanies, from which it appeared that during the Warpossession had been taken of these canals under theprovisions of the defence of the Realm ActsThisemergency power of posee?    A on and.the  exii s fc i. ng f inane ialguarantee by the State lapses on the 31st August next,and it is proposed that the Defence of the Realm RegulatJ**m*Order respecting them Aboaiid &quot;oe revoked,,  and the present arrangements terminated as from &quot;Ghat date.    In order toprovide against the possibility of these canals becomingdereliot during the period that must elapse before theGovernment policy in regard to their future is formulated,it was proposed that the Minister of Transport should takepossession of canals under the Ministry of Transport Act,with a view to authorising an increase of tolls and charge and als&quot;) that the State should be prepared to render finan-c&amp;al assistance to the canals until a definite policyrespocting them is adopted..The Conference also had before them a Memorandum by thoChancellor of the Exchequer (0.P.-1648) in which it waspcinted out that it was by no means certain that continuedsubsidisation by the State was necessary in order to keepcanals in being.    Moreover,  the experience of operation without the support of &amp; subsidy would afford a goodtest of relative usefulness,, while the absence of Statesupport and the necessity foi working canals on a stricteconomic
economic ? would have a ? influence ?. In the event of the Minister of Transport&apos;s proposals being adopted,  it wan suggested that tolls and charges should be increased at the earliest possible moment; that the State should assume the smallest possible obligation consistent with the continued work of the canals; that certain canals should be allowed to become derelict; and that the agreement should not extend in any case beyond the 31st March, 19?.

 On behalf of the proposals it was urged that this was a step in the direction of getting rid of a subsidy,  that before an advance was made to help any particular canal the consent of the Treasury would be obtained, that there was no question of an increased charge on the Vote for 1920/21, though it would be necessary to modify the wording of the Estimate which had not yet been passed and that advances would be restricted to a limited period.

The Conference decided -

To approve the proposals set out in the memorandum of the Minister of Transport (C.P. 1696).

THREATENED STRIKE OF MEMBERS OF THE ELECTRICAL TRADES UNION IN THE EVENT OF NON-RECOGNITION OF THEIR UNION BY THE POST-MASTER GENERAL

2. The Conference had under consideration Memoranda by the Minister of Labour (C.P.1596), the First commissioner of Works (C.P.1626), and the postmaster General relative to the situation which had arisen in consequence of the refusal of the Postmaster General to recognise the Electrical Trades Union.

 On the one hand, it was pointed out that other Government Departments had recognised and negotiated with the E.T.U, and that the continued refusal of the Post-master General to have any dealings with the Union might result in the withdrawal of members of the E.T.U. from Government work all over the country, causing serious dislocation and inconvenience to all Departments particularly
. On behalf of the Post Officer &quot;tt--8as- reixrefcefl^d.-that the Post Office Engineering Union has for many-years--been recognised as the Association representing the raniand file of the Engineering Department of the Post Off ioe*.This Union has 20,000 members - roughly 4/s of the total-&apos;&quot;&apos;number of employees.    The E.T.U.,  on the other hand,enly claims 1,500 Post Office members, and there is reason to believe that this claim is grossly exaggerated.There is great fricticn between the two Unions, and thePost Office Engineering Union has reoently passed aresolution threatening in the event of the Post Officegranting recognition to the E.T.U., to bring about ageneral cessation of work in the Engineering Department.In the view of the Postmaster General,  it was mostiaaAviR&amp;ble to have any dealings with the E.T.U. and ifcommunication refusing recognition was to be made to thatUnion, this should be done through the medium of theMinistry of labour, and not through the Post Office.It was agreed(1) to approve the proposal of&quot;the Postmaster.   Generaito refuse to accord recognition,to the E.T.U. in any fona.(2) that this decision should be communicatedto the Union by a letter signed by thepostmaster General.3. The Conference had under consideration a Memorandumby the wocretary of state for War (C.P-1642) appealingagainst the decision of the Home affairs Committee(Meeting 67), Conclusion 5, to approve Clause 4 of thePost Office and Telegraph Bill which repealed Section o of post Office Act (1908) exempting letters sSf seamen andsoldiers from the ordinary rates of postage in certain cir-cunstanoes.    The repeal of this privilege had been urged by the Post Office, both on the grcuad of administrative convenience and because the present high rates of Army
and iterv; pay rendered- it-s-^oontiJiu&amp;d^ redve^rtdu^^A^1^^*ah3a-On &quot;behalf of the service Departments, it -was pointedout that this concession was one of long standing, and thatgreat importance was attached to the privilege, especiallyin the case of troops serving abroad who, should not be givenpause for discontent by the unnecessary withdrawal of aprivilege which had been so long secured to them by statute.TThile it was true that the privilege had fallen intodesuetude during the war when free postage aas in ape rationit was felt that at the present time when many men wereserving abroad under conditions app2*cxlmating to war conditions that any attempt to impose the full postage rate would be bitterly resented.In the course of the discussion it transpired that-owJion-the privilege was first given the -  Id.    ratepaid by the  soldier and sailer was substantially -1*werthan either the domestic or the foreign rates; thereduction of the domestic rate to &apos;    Id.,    meant that the privilege only applied to men on foreign servico and the fixing prior to the war of the Imperial postage at Id.caused the privilege to fall into desuetude -   While theConference thought that there was a strong case for givingthe man serving abroad the privilege of postage at the domestic rate,  it was also felt that present sircumstanoesjustified contiruring the war privilege of free postage inthe case of men serving abroad under war conditions.It was agreed -(1) that men on foreign service under normal peace conditions should pay postage at the domestic rate (now Sd. ).r*a**e(2). that in any particular/the question whetherthe men on foreign service were serving under war conditions (and so eligible for freepostage) cr peace conditians (and so eligiblefor the domestic rate) should be settled bythe lighting Department concerned and thePostmaster General; in the eVBnt of dis-.  agreement the case to bo referred to theChancellor of the Exchequer, whose daeisi^nshould be final.,&apos;i - 4 -
ARMING OF ? FORCES THE COLON? AND PRO-?TORATES.



(4) The Conference had under consideration a Memorandum by the Overseas Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence (Paper C.I.D.-125-C) calling attention to the great importance of doing everything possible under existing conditions to encourage the Colonies and Protectorates to maintain efficient local military forces, and suggesting -

(i) That the rifles and machi? necessary to re-arm the local military and semi-military police forces together with  an initial issue of ammunition at 500 rounds per rifle and 10,000 rounds per mach? should be given to the local Governments free of charge:

(ii) That this should be done on the understanding that the local Governments will pay for all packing and transit charges and for the future maintenance of all arms and ammunition.

The Memorandum stated that it was estimated that the total number of rifles required would not exceed 50,000, and the total number of machine-guns would not exceed 150.

It was agreed --

To approve the recommendations of the Overseas Sub-Committee, on the understanding that it should be made clear to the Colonies and Pro-protectorates concerned that the present issue was an act of grace and that the future maintenance of the arms and ammunition was a matter solely for the local Governments.

PROPOSED STATE GRANT IN AID OF VOLUNTARY HOSPITALS.



(5)  The Conference had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Health (Paper C.P.-1578) drawing attention to the grave position of the voluntary hospitals throughout the country and the necessity of some assistance from public funds if the entire breakdown of the voluntary system was to be averted. The situation was aggravated by the reduction in this the number of military patients and a reduction of the income from subscriptions, attributable to the effects of increased taxation and the rise in the cost of living, as well as by the augmentation of wages and expenses generally. The proposal of the Ministry of Health was that a grant of £100,000 should be sanctioned on condition that the aggregate of the
v^lajriirecrT&apos; -s:rfb^Trtp&apos;bl ^ and dOTiertio-ns- raks-od Jtxr ho-srpj tale-^dxoring L920 -amounted to no less  than the total raised from.voluntary sources during 1919, and a further grant not-eocce^*ilng  400,800 on the following terms;-(i)     50,000  of.   the first  1 &quot;.0,000 by whichthe income from voluntary subscriptionsfor 1020 exceeds  thai for- 1919:(ii)     7 5,000 fo,-  (he  second  100/000 by whichtho income of ISJ9 is  exceeded:(ill)     1 foi  Ll  for any increase in voluntary contributions beyond the first  200,000.At the same time, the Memorandum laid great stress on theimportance of maintaining the hospitals on a voluntary basis as the voluntary system was more economical than the alternative of State hospitals; while, if that system were allowedto collapse, there would be an irrestible demand forhospitals to be taken over by the State or the LocalAuthorities.    There was also a growing agitation In&apos;favourof hospitals being maintained from public fluids,  and this wathe avowed policy of the Labour Party.    The view of theTreasury, on the other hand, was that hospitals were essen-tially local institutions and must look to local support,whether public or private, for their maintenance.In respect of a suggestion that the Prince of Wales&apos;Fund might be.  asked to make a large contribution to meet theexisting drficit, It was stated that the Trustees of the already been approached on.the subject and that they hadFund had/no legal  powe&apos; to make sum contribution, as theadministration of the Fund was strictly confined to personswho had been injured during the Far,Some discussion followed, in the course of which theCabinet were reminded of the great increase of expenditure which had to be provided for in the Supplementary Estimates.It was generally agreed that it was essential tomaintain the voluntary system, if possible, and it wasdecided
MESOPOTAMIA,aithah.(a) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Health should ascertaiAthe exact legal position of the Prince of wales 1 Fund, and whether it would not bepossible, imder the terras of the Trust,for a large contribution to be made witha view to wiping out the present deficits:(b) If this were found to be not legally possible,Or otherwise impracticable, to sanction an ad hoc grant of an amount not e xceeding 200,0&quot;00,  to bo distributed on a basisagreed upon by tho Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of health in consultation,,(6)    The Cabinet took note of a telegram received by theSecretary of State for War dealing with the situation inMesopotamia.     On Monday, -July 19th. the leading columnhad reached a point four miles north-west of Ruraaithah,where strong opposition was encountered, a strong force,of the enemy holding three lines of embankments and using bombs and machine-guns.   A prolonged engagementtook place.    The fighting was severe, but our attack was successful, and a counter-attack by the enemy afterdark was beaten off.    The enemy were bombed and machine-gunned with effect by aeroplanes which co-operated withthe troops.NTS FOR (7)    The Conference had under consideration a MemorandumTREATMENTTUBERCULOSIS, by the Minister of Health (Paper CP,-1588) pointing outthat the National Health Insurance Act . 1920, provided,inter alia, for the discontinuance of Sanatorium Benefit.It became essential, therefore;, in order to secureefficient provision in every area, to introduce legislationimposing Upon the County and County Borough. Councils thestatutory duty of providing adequate institutional treat-ment.   The question therefore arose of what assistance should be given from the Exchequer to the County and CountyBorough Councils in view of the insurance money they would now lose through the passing of the recent Insurance Act.The Memorandum/
recommended that the Government should sanction   whenSanatorium Benefit ceased, that Councils should- receive an exchequer grant equivalent to the amounts tiioy now receive from tho Insurance Committees, in addition to the presentgrant of 50 per cent of their net expenditure after thodeduction of the former grant.     The Treasury, on the otherhand, proposed an arrangement under which the annual grant to each Council in respect of tho treatment of tuberculosisshould be fixed at the total amount actually received bythe Council in the financial year ending March 31, I 20.either from the Insurance Committee or the Government grant,until such time as the expenditure of the Council justified ahigher grant on the 50 per cent basis.     The Memorsndumpointed out that tho effect of this proposal would be thatall additional expenditure incurred, by the Councils in excessof the expenditure during 1919-SO would, be thrown on tho ratesuntil the additional expenditure exceeded their presentincome from insurance funds.(8)    The Conference were informed that the Boaru of customs and Excise had recently been asked to extend theirpresent arrangements for the examination of baggage and cargoentering Ireland with a view to preventing the irregularimportation of arms and ammunition,&apos; ana they had accordinglydespatoned a large number of additional officials to thatcountry.    These officials had now expressed their desire tobe allowed to return to England,  as they were really In. fearof their lives owing to threats received from ainn Beiiersas to what would happen to them should they stop theImportation of arms.After some discussion,   it was agreed  It wasagreed  To adjourn the further consldethe question until, the.
