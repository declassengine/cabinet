(l) With reference to his Note (Paper CP.-1901) covering a letter from Sir John Bradbury with enclosure relative tothe Spa Coal Advances, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in-formed the Cabinet that the French G over rime nt had now decided to confirm tho arrangements unanimously reached bya Sub-Committee of the Reparation Commission with HerrBrargmann, under which, inter alia, the bonds to be depositedby the German Government in respect of the advances made bythe Allies upon coal deliveries were to be repayable on the2l3t May, 1921, with permission to Germany to apply for two half-yearly renewals enabling her to defer actual re-payment to the 1st May, 1922.NOTE.  Since the meeting of the Cabinet, freshdifficulties have arisen (see Tale gramswhich have -passec, between the Treasury&quot;and&apos; Sir John&apos; Bradbury - Appendix&apos; 1T*(2) With reference to Cabinet 50 (20) , Conclusion 17,the Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the resumption of trade with Russia:-(a) Note by the Secretary, Cabinet (paper CP. -1880)Memorandum by the Secretary of State forroreign affairs s (Paper CP.-1897).Memorandum by the secretary of State forWar (Paper CP.-1898).Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(Paper 0. P. -1899).(b) Military Stores lor Poland and Russia.Memorandum by the President of the Board. of Trade (Paper C P.-1890).The Cabinet decided to postpone the considerationof the questions raised in these Papers, but agreed -That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should forthwith send a telegram to the Soviet Government demanding theimmediate release of tho British prisonersstill retained in Russia, and stating thatif the prisoners were not released noresumption oi trade was possible.-  and thatit would be necessary for the British Gov-ernment to consider what further action must be taken.
Lg.c j/rpflAT&apos;       (?) ^he Cabinet were informed that it had been decidedPP&apos;t?&apos;SF!NTA-IqU TO ALLIED to present over 1,000 medals to persons in Allied andIgUTRALNeutral States In recognition of services of various kindsrendered by them during the War,  including assistance toBritish prisoners and others.    the Foreign Office, which hadto distribute the medals; did not consider the design of themedal, which represented a nude male figure, as suitable forthe purpose.The Cabinet,  after viewing the design for the medal,unanimously agreed  That the design was quits unsuitable.lt,HFRALD?      (4.) With reference to Cabinet 51 (20), Conclusion 5,  thequestion was raised as to the expediency,. in view of therecent revelations, of continuing to insert in the &quot;daily herald&quot; Government advertisements, particularly those cf theNational Par Savings Committee.It was explained that,  in the view of the Wax- SavingsCommittee,  the advertisements resulted in money being invested in war savings which would not otherwise be obtained, and thatto withdraw the advertisements luight lead the Labour Party totake a hostile attitude towards the war Savings movement.It was agreed  That the advertisements should be withdrawnafter the existing contract has expired.
(5) The Cabinet were Informed by the President of theBoard of Trade that he had no farther information as to the&quot;probable outcome of the meeting between the Executive of theMiners&apos; federation and the Miners&apos; Delegates this morning.It was pointed cut that the present attitude of themen amounted to a demand for the additional 2/- on thepresent rate of output, and that it was very desirable to getaway from the expression &quot;datum line5 which was confusing thepublic.Attention was drawn to the fact that after the Execu-tive of the Miners&apos; Federation had requested that the normal practice should be followed of only publishing agreed state-ments, an ex parte version of what had taken place at the meetings with the owners had appeared in the Press.It was agreed  That the President of tine Board of trade would be Justified in coiiimnnicating* ifhe thought fit, with the. Miners1 Executivewith a view to the publication of the docu-ments relating- to prices and output? whichhad been presented&quot;by the parties to thedispute.
,gQrvice(6) With reference to Cabinet h2 (20) , Conclusion 3,the-^ahijaex had under consideration a Memorandum by theliinister of Labour (reaper CP.-100?) res poet ins the verygreat hardship which the ex-Servioe men, who had exhaustedtheir right to donation, will experience between now and thetime itfhen the various plans for the employment of ex-Servicemen, now being considered by the&apos; Housing Committee and theUnemployment Committee of the Cabinet, may be expected tobecome operative, and suggesting that, as public opinion would not support the Government in referring such men to the poor Law, authority should be given tor the prolongation ofthe B weeks of the third extension by a further period of 6weeks, to be&apos;drawn not later than the 8th November, at an estimated oost to the Exchequer net exceeding  250,000.On the one hand it was un-red that, at the presenttime, when a great strike was threatened.) it would he most undesirable that there should he a large number of ex-Servicemen in a destitute condition, forming a discontented nucleuswhich might be utilised by the extremists In any serious Indus-trial troubles, and that pending the acceptance by the C-ov-ernment of the recommendations of the Housing and UnemploymentCommittees it was very desirable that provision should be roa.dewhich would keep the men out of the workhouse.On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that,onthe last occasion -hen the matter was before them, it had been generally agreed that lurther extensions or donation wereuno.esira.ble, and that if such extensions were found necessarythey should be limit ad to men with satisfactory militaryrecords.    To accept the Ministry or Labour proposals would create a nev/ precedent, since the proposals involved givingthe men an extension of benefit for the whole period.    It was accordingly urged that any extension should be limited to themen with satisfactory military records, and, moreover, shouldbe given at the rate oi 15/-, which was the amount payable
under the new Insurance Act, and not at the 20/- rate.After sore further discussion, in which it appeared that the Ministry of Labour would not be in a position to distinguish between the deserving and undeserving ex-Servicemen before the 8th November next-, and that the Ministry were considering proposals for enabling the ex-Service can whohr.d b*er unemployed to obtain benefits on the lines of theInsurance Act froffi November 8th next,  the Cabinet,  in orderto tide over the difficulties of the next  few -.,eoks,  agreed (a) To accept the proposals contained in theMinister of Labour&apos;s Mennrandum (paper cp.-1903) that the eight weeks of the.third extension of Donation should be prolonged by a further period -of six weeks,  the Donation to be drawn not later than November 6th:(b) That the Minister of Labour should submithis proposals for the special benefit, assoon as possible, with a view to theirearly consideration by the Cabinet.(&apos;7) With reference to Cabinet 37 (20), Appendix I (7)  (b),the Cabinet were infortr-ed that the ppuestion of the futureof the Aaland Islends was under consideration by the Leagueof Nations, which had decided that it was competent to invest-igate the matter and proposed that in the first- instance the investigation should be entrusted to a Commission which wouldadvise the Council of the League as to the- decision.    TheCouncil was at present considering the personnel of theOof-miss ion, and the Secretary-General had made informalenouiries as to whether the British Government would have any objection to the nomination by the Council of a disting-uished British states roan to the Commission.It was pointed out that, to serve any useful purpose,the Commission must be- a strong one, comprising rep.reser.ta-fives of several of the principal Powers, and that therepresentatives should be persons of very high authority.On the other hand, it was felt that it would be better if great Britain fas not mixed up in this highly contentiousmatter, and that such responsibility as this country hadalready incurred by urging that the question should be

J?%Hftil waul4 be inoy^aged if a leading part on the proposed Coiwi ission was taken by aBritish representative.After some di s ^nsalon, in which it was suggestedthat lord Puckrrester would be a suitable British representa-tive, it was agreed ---That the Secretary to th.- Cabinet should communicate wlth the Secretary-General ofthe league of Nations, informing him that,in the view of the Cabinet, efforts shouldbe made to persuade an American jurist to sit on the Commission, o.nd that in any event the Cabinet wore not in favour of an Englishrepresentative unless a French representa-tive of equal distinction vas also appointed.JE TROOPS (8) With reference to Cabinet 51 (20), Conclusion 3,I THEJIKIONS the Cabinet were irf or mod that answers had now been receivedSERVICEOAD. from Canada and Australia refusing to entertain the proposal that those Dominions should raise Battalions for foreign service, but that New Zealand had not only replied offering to provide a Battalion but also agreeing to pay for thetroops so provided.It was agreed that it weald be undesirable to accepttho Mew Zealand offer if the other Dominions took a differentline.&quot;he Cabinet agreed  -That,  provided the War Office concurred,the Secretary of State fox the colonies should send a very cordial message of thanks to the Government of the dominion of Hew Zealand, adding that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not at present propose- to pursue the matter further.(9) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn b:,  thePrime Minister to a telegram which he had received fromGeneral Smuts saying that,  if it would in any way assist ina solution of the difficultiesIreland, he would be pre-pared to publish a suggestion that the responsible leadersof Irish opinion should make an appeal for the reference ofthe Irish Question to the Imperial Cabinet, and that, pend--ing the next meeting of that body, a truce should be observed. -6-

Progi Captain Elliot,Copy of cablegram received from JPgrig,,October 1st.  1920. 10 a.m.&quot;&quot;5372.      Following from Bradbury for Plackett.$Jo conclusion yet reached about coal advance duetomorrow.    Difficulties of earmarking Reparation receiptsto repayment have proved very formidable and French Govern-ment is now considering suggestion that bonds should be payable in cash by Germany in three equal instalmentslet May, 1922,  1st October,  1922, and 1st May,  1925,Germans will probably accept this which in the circuit-stances seems to me best solution.    October advance willbe fixed provisionally at sixty uillion gold marks as incase September.    British share will be nine hundred andeighty two thousand eight hundred and sixty eight poundsone shilling and twopence ( 982,868:1:2) but transfershould not be made pending further advice from me.Following for Bradbury from Chancellor of. Exchequer.Your No.5372 to Blackett.    Pis Majesty&apos;s government cannot agree to postponement of repayment by Germany ofCoal advances beyond 1st May,  1921.    Such postponement is contrary to agreement that these advances have absolute priority.

There was general agreement,  in the view reached by the Ministers concerned as the result of a discussion atthe Inter-Departmental Committee on Eastern Affairs,  that sir percy Cox, who has left Teheran with a view to taking up a post at the head of the Administration in Mesopotamia,should be instructed,  before returning home to consult withthe British Government,  to remain at Baghdad sufficiently long to place himself in possession of all the facts of thesituation bearing on the. question of how the policy of developing an Arab Government is to be applied.    It wasalso agreed that sir.Arnold Wilson,  notwithstanding his great services,  should be withdrawn from Mesopotamia.    Itwas suggested that he-should be available for consultationwith the British Government at the same time as sir percy cox,It was clear at an. early stage of the discussion thatthe military question must be considered as a Whole.    In
I-ersia,  Northo..m Wi^pcrfcamia.   in tha Xtwiid. .Veaa4ju5-uli -andin &quot;the region of Const ant ihople, tho situation was serious and,  in order to carry out our existing policy,  relnforce-ments %ere either required immediately or likely to berequired in the near future.    It was possible,  also,  that circumstances might arise necessitating re inforoe rents fcrPalestine and hg^;pt.    In the pre seat stage of our militarydevelopment, however, when the Par **rmy has been completelydemobilised and the post-war jrray is in its infancy, no general reserve  exists,  end reinforcements for one theatrecould only be obtained by withdrawing troops from another.It was recognised that our military situation was such thatit would hardly be possible tc avoid asking Parliament forfurther appropriations,  and It was suggested that a, warning of this ought to be given at an early date.The present situation in each of the disturbed theatresin the Middle hast,  as set forth in the Papers before theConference,  was carefully examined,  and it has generally agreed to confer on the subject on the following day withthe Chief of the Imperial General staff and the Chief of theAir staff.    &apos;ihe most immediately menacing situation was inthe Ismid Peninsula, where some minor fighting has already taken place.In this connection attention was called to the pcs si-biiities of co-operation by Greece, and it was stated thatLhVenizelos was prepared to take such action as might be desired of him without asking for military or financial support. The Greeks were now in occupation of Western Thraceand wore prepared to advance into hasteru Thrace.    They also had a large force in the Smyrna area,  and were preparedto act against Mustapha kemal.The question cf Greek co-operation gave rise to a dis-cussion as to the fundamental interests of British policyin the hear hast,  and it was suggested that it was to our interest definitely to support the Greeks.
It was generally agreed that, having regard to thevery strong and even dramatic line of policy taken by theBritish plenipotentiaries in regard to the Treaty of leacewith Turkey, to retire from Constantinople before a bandit]ike Mustapha Kemal would deal a shattering blow to our prestige in the Aast, and that this could not possibly becontemplated.After some further discussion it was agreed(a) That the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff and the Chief of the Air staff should be invite-i to attend a further meeting of the Conference at 11 a.it;,on the following &apos;day:t(b) That the Secretary of State for War should,before the meemiirg,  ask them to be preparedto express the i r cpin ior.s on the military aspects of a policy under the following heads:-1. Authorise Greeks to advance intoEastern Thrace at once.Hi Give them manoeuvring liberty in the smyrna area., but warn them againstgetting involved deeply03. Bring a Greek Division to reinforceConstantinople area.4, Evacuate Batumi and transfer garrisonto Isrmido5.

Withdraw from Persia forthwith.70 Contract to railheads in Mesopotamia,and develop Alr iorco there, andgradually re-occupy as cur strengthgrows and circumstances allow in thenext few years.(o) That on the following day the conference should consider the  desirability of sending the following telegram to Sir iorcy Cox; .DPAPT OP TELEGLvilvi FROM SECRETARY OP STATEPCS INDIA,  TO CIYJ.L COMMISSIONER, MESOPOT-AMI A,AIMS,   My telegram of 16th June.

Venizelos, the Greek President of theCouncil, whose views- are summarised in Appendix .1IX..As a result of this discussion the following action was concerted:-(a) M.

APPENDIX I.STATEMENT BY THE CHIEF CF   THE IMPERIALGENERAL STAFF.The Chief Of the Imperial General Staff said that from the telegrams which had been received it would appearthat the Turkish Nationalist Army was attacking the Britishpos xtiea    on the Ismid. Peninsula.      This position&quot;-   was35cf an extent of /   miles and the- &quot;battalions which wereavailable there were very weak in numbers.    It was true thatthe Nationalist Army was composed of Irregular troops whowere not formidable as compared with the British and german troops who had been fighting t&amp;tthe late war, but there was great difficulty in preventing the emissaries from the opposing   &apos; crces slipping through our lines and upsettingthe population in the rear.   Unless it was possible to re-inforce the British troops holding this line he thought it quite possible they would have to fall back.   If this had to &quot;be daneGefn.I*ilne would probably takn up a line some ten to 15 milesBcsphorous the enofrom the      /    vdilch would be shorter than/he was nowholding.    In order to onsure the troops at General Milne&apos;disposal being able to hold on In their present positionhe thought it would be necessary to reinforce them with atleast one Division to start with and further reinforce-ments - would&quot; be necessary later on.   He was varydoubtful whether warships could assist in the operations a3the ground was very broken.   The Tunkish Nationalist army was in occupation of the southern coastline of the Sea ofMarmara and on the southern side of the Dardanelles therewere two British battalions and there was really no reason why these should not be driven into the sea if the forces under Mustapha Kemal chose to attack them.    He felt, there-fore, very uneasy about this isolated force and would very-1-
much like- to see-At reinforced.    On the Galltpoli PeninsuXr..the French had one battalion.   He thought the position ofthis French battalion was fairly secure, as the warshipscould prevent any of the Turkish Nationalist troops fromcrossing the Dardanelles or Sea -of Marrapra.   He was alittle uneasy as to the possible situation which might arise as to the feeding of the population of Constantinople,as he thought it was quite probable that the nationalist forces might stop any supplies from reaching the tpwn bythe Anatclian Railway,, and. vials...nig,ht result In s eriousinternal trouble.    General Milne was cf opinion thatfor the moment vb&quot; could/dea2 with tne situation^n-in..,Oonsta^E^^K^le-,p1.:- -* with the troops at his disposalH^g^the^ ^IfJbh-Q^assistance of the Fleet.-but.ne-*?as decidedly of the opirdsonthat he    could not with the troops at his disposal carryout this work and at the same time ensure the security.ofthe Insmid   Peninsula;, and the southern side of theDardanelles,and that was why he was asking to be allowedat once to have the battalions from Batoum.    If the Brtitishforces lost the coast of the Ismid   Peninsula - it was hard to say what the position of Constantinople might be as Itwould be possible for the Nationalist forces to shell thetown night and day.   Moreover, the Bosphor       would be clos^and it would be more than likely that the population would get out of hand.    If the Turkish Nationalist Army   are byany chance to seize the Chamak side of the Dardanelles thesituation would be even still more difficult.    He saw noreason why   Mustapha Kemal should not in a bout six v^eks1time have some 40,000 troops at his disposal.    If he (theC.I.G.S.) were In the position of Mustapha Kemal he wouldadvance against Chanak at once.    The whole situation de-pended on what the Commander of the Turkish NationalistArmy decided to do now and he would like to call serious
9 0attention to the fact that unless7 th^-iixxrps In the constantinople area at Chanak^and on the Ismids Peninsulal^were strongly reinforced it was quite possible that tsemight have a disaster.    One battalion had already been or-dered from Malta to General Milne1s command and one cavalry regiment from Palestine.    There were also two battalionswhich could be brought from Batoum and possibly two additionalnative battalions could be withdrawn from Palestine.   He wasnot at all sure, however, that these reinforcements wouldbe sufficient and he would not feel easy in his mind unlessreinforcements of one Division could be sent to constantinople and Ismid:  and one or two brigades to reinforce the troops on the southern side of the Dardanelles.    If the French and italians, -or both, could be got to hcQg? so much the better.He did not think, however, there was any chance of gettingFrench troops proper as they would not leave Prance.The Greeks had 6 Divisions in the Smyrna area and three cn the maritza.   He was a little doubtful, however, as to whether the greeks were not a little optimistic as to what it was In their power to do.   He had discussed the situation on the previous evening with M. Venizelos and he had asked him if the Greek forces in the Smyrna area were strong enough to advance toPanderma, as such a move would at any rate cover the forcesholding the southern shore of the Dardanelles.   M.&quot; Venlzeloshad replied that he could not  ay, but that he would-consult the Greek General Staff .ityAs regards the possiblJ/of a move from Smyrna tothe Anatolian Railway this would entail a big operation and he doubted if they could carry it out at all and in any case Itwould take three to four months as the transport facilities in the country in question were most primitive, anr it would be
0 0(-.1 Dnecessary--to form -dumps of ammunition, fond. etc. all along the line of advance.    It had to be borne in mind that 40 or 50 French battalions had just suffered a seriousreverse.    The Turkish troops might nob be regarded as formidable-able if compared with the English and German troops fighting in the recent van, but operating in their own rough countryhe would like to say that they were iA his opinion difficultopponents to deal with.    If the Greeks contemplated an operation against -^anderma it might be possible to landsome of them there bp sea,    He doubted, howver, if theywould be able to w? i-hlraw very many troops either from the smyrna area or from those on the Marloza and any rei nforce-ments which they would require to carry out, such an opera-tion would, he  theught, have to come from Greece.    TheTurkish Nationalist Army were not in possession of any artillerythat could &quot;os regarded as really s serious and most of their3QMkiur  were, he thought, of a light type.   Still, they couldshe!5    small steamers passing up the Straits, if they werein possession of the southern approach.Ke did not thinkthatthere was any/doubt the Greeks could advance to the Chataljastarting from the Maritzaline/; this would take,  no doubt, a little time but if it wascarried out it would certrinly be a great help.    He would liketo raise the question of further reinforcements since if a division was moved to Constantinople it would practically mean in his opinion starting another war with Turkey and possiblyRussia later on.   Moreover, it might lead to further fighting in Mesopotamia.    The refcult of doing this might therefore bevfco commit ourselves to a heavy charge in the wa:y of sol-diers both for occupying the demilitarized zone in Turkey andel so operations in Mesopotamia and Persia, and might eventuallyrequire a great number of Divisions.    Whether eventually the
the situation which he had    .n mind would lead or not to a war with Afghanistan he could not say,hut if this did happen at least another 3 to 5 divisions would be required.    What he wanted to explain was that themore reinforcements we: were to send into the theatre of operations the more the fighting was likely to extend,  andto give a small illustration   he would like to point outthat 12 months  ago one Italian battalion had remained withnowno difficulty at Konla whereas Axx&amp;kx 6 British battalionsw re being hard pressed on the Ismid   Peninsula .   His own opinion was that the operations would continue for several years and although it would be a/great help to get the Greeksto come to our  assistance now he did not think that such a move would really solve the problem.    He thought palestine was undoubtedly the best place from which to draw on forBritish reinforcements at the moment.   He thought that it wouldbe safe to use the Indian troops who were serving in Palestine.As regards Mesopotamia he did not think that it wouldbe possible to continue holding the area which we at present occupied with the number of troops at our disposal.    It wasnot that he expected an a ctual attack but he foresaw .the country r      getting very unsettled, the railways would, be cut and everyone would have to move about under escorts, andfor these reasons he did not think that with the troops atpresent available it would be possible    to continue to holdMozu and if it was intended to do this reinforcements would be necessary .As regards withdrawing, it was very difficult tosay what effect any retirement would have as everyone knew what a retirement meant when carried out Inf ront of a nativeenemy.    The whole problem really ought to be treated as one.thatHe did not think ^ith the forces at present in Mesopotamiait would be possible to carry out an offensive operation with
2 3 0a view to gaining a success as all the different -?v.r&apos;a?.participator therewere very weak and immobile.     He thought that in order tosecure the territory now held in Mesopotamia at least anotherdivision would be necessary and this division would have to be a mobile one*      If such forces were available It would be possibleroughly &apos;to handle/the Arabs and Kurds,     There was, however, noplace from which such a division could be obtained except from persia and there itifcaa &quot;therp roughly a division and a largenumber of motor wa svhifin &amp;ould be made  available.      If these forces were transferred to Mesopotamia he thought there would befor the present no difficulty in dealing with the situation/,but that wouldmean leavingiprsia entirely.     Again,  as regards the latter country if we were to remain - on there in our oresent position It would the * &apos; ;be necessary to reinforce /troops  -already there.     Broadly thesituation was, our forces were too weak in the Constantinoplearea and also too weak in Mesopotamia, and there was really noplace from which reinforcements could be drawn for Mesopotamiaexcept Persia.     He did not think that with the troops at present available it lould be possible to hold on in either Mesopotamiaor Persia for another 6 months, even if the situation were onlyviewed from the point of view of the soldiers themselves, ,.and from a military point of view his own personal opiniont/as that all the troops should be withdrawn from Persia and sent to Mesopotamia^
APPBHDLX    II.VIEWS EXPRESSED BY AIR&apos; MARSHAL SIR H.1.TREE.CHARD,Bart. Z.C.B., D.S.O.,  Chief of Air staff.AIR MARSHAL SIR H.M.TRER CHARD said that he viewed with nolittle uneasiness the situation from an Air point of view.    i?orexample,  if the squadron asked for by General Milne was to beprovided, this could only be done by taking more than one Squadronaway from Egypt.    The situation in Egypt appeared rather more quietthan a few months ago, but he thought that nevetheless the WarOffice would be unwilling to release any Air units from the Egyptiangarrison,  as these were the minimum considered necessary until thesituation became more defined.    Out of the two Squadrons In mesopotamia and Persia one could only regain-d about one third of the aeroplanesas being available for operations.    This is due to the fact thatthe squadrons are split up into small detachments and in keeping aPlight at Easvin, 300 miles from its base,  out of the 6 machinesprobably only twa would be available.    The allotment of aeroplanesunder the new organisation was now being carried out, and those for mesopotamia wore yn their way there now.    Ireland was asking for moreaeroplanes at the moment, and it was not possible to find them.Again, there was the possibility of trouble in India.    The ostab-lishment of the ^ir^orce in that place at the present time was onlythe absolute minimum for normal purposes, and in the event of anytrouble arising aerial reinforcements up to IV ^ Squadrons might be demanded.    These could not be found from Egypt, and there were noother Reserves which could be drawn upon.    In order to provide aReserve of Squadrons during the next 12 to 18 months it would benecessary to know at once what additional number of Squadrons was going to be authorised, and it was for this reason that the authori-sation of a minimum r.oyal Air Eorce Reserve of five Squadrons hadalready been suggested.    He was of opinion that the two Flights now available in Persia should be transferred to Mesopotamia^ as thebest use of them could be made in the latter place,  and verylittle use could be made of them in Persia.
appendix, nr.VISVJS IgQPgBSSEjj BY H. V5HIZSL0S.M. Venizelos said that &quot;a Greek Division could at once be put at the disposal of General Jlilne, if H.M. Government so desired.     It could be taken frora the troops who were inV&apos;estern Thrace.     In addition to these troops his Governmenthad six divisions in Asia Minor.     As regards the questionwhich had been asked him by the Secretary of State for V.Taron the previous evening about a possible advance towardspanderma, he had telegraphed to the Greek Genaal Staff inorder to find out their views.     In doing so he had suggestedstopping the proposed operations in Eastern Thrace and re-in forcing the troops in the Smyrna area from those now in thrace.     Of course if one Greek Division were now       sentto Constantinople and Chanak this division would not beavailable.       There appeared to him to be two alternatives,the first of which was to send one Greek Division to ieirforceGeneral Milne&apos;a troops in Constantinople and at Chanak,  and atthe same time to consider the possibility of carrying out aemail operation in the Smyrna area In order to relievepressure elsewhere, and the othe^ was to reinforce the troopsIn the Smyrna area with a view to carrying out a big operationtowards Panderma.       He did not think there was any u&amp;e in asking his General Staff whether it was possible to send a division to Constantinople and at the same time carry outthe big operation.       He was quite ready to arrange for the division which it was proposed to send to Constantinoplebeing handed over to General Milne to do what he liked with.If it was agreed that thie division should go* orders should
be issued at onoe in order that they luighiv s&quot;fcart &quot;their- pr-er^rarfcixnis-and that transport should be obtained.      IP they could haveBritish aid in obtaining transports it would mean that thetroops could get nuicker to their destination.      The Creekshad altogether,  in organised units,  some 130,000 men and of these90,000 were in the Smyrna area and 4-0,000 in Thrace.      Inaddition there were some 30,000 or 40,000 in depots.      Anyproposal to mobilise additional troops rained a big question and in order to take any measures of this description he wouldkikK have to consult   his country.   He did not anticipate,however, any difficulty in getting the support of the Greekpeople if it was put to them that it was a question of enforcing the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and especially if it were known that the British Government were behind them.     He though&apos;in such circumstances it would be possible to raise an additional4 divisions who would number about 50,000 men, making the totalnumber of men available ^30,000. .    He had no information no towhat guns find ammunition were in the possession of the turkish nationalist Army.     Ee was quite sure that the Greek troops wouldbe able to operate with success against the Turks but in sayingthis he did not contemplate following the enemy up into the mountain regions, and the only danger to Greece was the pro-prolongation of the existing state of affairs with its economicresults.     He thought that in the event of trouble with the bulgarians the Serbians would adhere to their&quot;Treaty with greece and give them their moral support, but he doubted if they could expect any support from Serbia in the way of actual men.

(S)    La? BaJ-fcxL^^^e^^n^^O^^x^^xicre an aocouni of&quot;the. -(XXEDiaznixi^rbLons which had passed between him andthe prime minister with reference to the relations of Russia with foland and with this country.The attention of the Conference was then calledtc the  telegrams exchanged between ties cow and iuJEameneffwhich had been intercepted and deciphered.      these telegrams showed that whereas EL    G-evernment wasgenuinely endeavouring to re-establish trading relationswit h the Soviet Cove mime nt, t h e Pus s i an Trade De 1 e ga t i c nhad in fact been actively engaged during their visitin propaganda aimed, at wridcrnrirriiig the present economic organisation of society.Tho President of the hoard of Trade stated that the damage which was being done by the Russian agitatorswas of sc grave a nature that it was most important to get them out of the country immediately..       In orderto justify this  step to the Labour movement it would be essential to make a complete exposure of their trickeryby the publication of the deciphered telegrams.It &quot;was agreed:-(l) That the time had now come to request the Russian Trade Delegation to leave thiscountry and a complete exposure of  their conduct bo ice.do in the Press:. (2) That a dossier of the documents from aboutthe time of tho arrival In this country of1-i.hameneff should be prepared immediately by Sir Basil Thompson,  together with thedraft of a covering note fcr publicationi n the newspap ers;(3) That her Sonar Law should communicate these documents to the Prime Minister with a viewto obtaining his concurrence in theirpublication.
(3)    Sir James^Craig-^read to tho Conference a detailedappreciation of tho situatixr^.ln Ulster which he had&apos;prepared, from which it appeared that the position was developing unfavourably with great rapidity:    thatthe Loyalists were losing faith in the Government1sdetermination to protect them, and were threateningan immediate recourse to arms, which would precipitate0 i v i 1 ..&apos; ar.Sir James Praia proceeded to ask the Government to approve the foil owing proposals:(a) The immediate appointment of a government authority, e.g., an Undor-Secretary, in Belfast,to represent the Government in the six counties:*(b) This Authority should have directaccess to the Chief Secretary,  and should hotho civil Authority responsible for the mainton-ance of law and order in the six Counties:(c) Moreover, in order to arrange for tho transferlater of the. Administration cf the sir: Countiesunder the Government of Ireland Bill, he shouldhave a staff whose duty it would be to make allthe necessary preparations in conjunction withCommittees to be appointed locally:(d) A Commissioner of the Boyal Irish Constabularyshould be appointed for the control of theConst a b-u 1 a r y i n th e six Counti.es, and for th epomp1oto oontrol and organisatian,fff a Special^Constabulary poree IrT that area^, &quot;and to&quot; makeafraii^eTn^nTs^for&quot;&quot;&quot;tl*o&quot; future &quot;Constabulary Porce.(e) The Commander in Chief in Ireland should devolvesuch of his powers to the Local Military authority in Belfast as would enable the latter to deal withany local developments, and to act in co-operationwith tho Ulster Civil Authority and with the Cemmiss-practitioner without reference to Lublin Castle.(f) A Force of Special Constables should bo raioedto assist the Government Pcrces in the maintenanceof law and order, and should bo sufficiently numerousto ensure that adequate Police posts are re-established throughout tho six Counties, and that any new measures ordered by the Government are properlyenacted,,      This force must be armed, and detailed forgeneral duty within tho six Counties only.      As faras possible tho organisation should be on militarylinos.      Probably a strength of S,C0C would suffice for tho six Counties unless any of tho troops now in ulster H2JB withdrawn,  or unless a general risingtakes place.
(g) a reserve force of Special Constabulary should be raised from the loyal population, which would only be called out for duty in case of emergency. Arms should be issued to certain members of this Force who, when called cut for duty, would be properly paid and indemnified by the State. Possibly, it would be well to swear in a very much larger number of persons than would be required for duty at one time. This would enable reliefs to be formed, and would also ensure that a large proportion of the population is brought under discipline. A special constabulary Reserve should be organised by the Royal Irish Constabulary Commissioner mentioned in para.  4., but should be commanded by their own local Leaders, and they should obtain authority to drill and to do musketry. They should also be required to perform duty within the vieinity of their homes.(h) The organisation of the Ulster Volunteer Force should be used for this purpose, as was done for raising the 36th (Lister) Livision when the War broke out.

(i) The Government should announce forthwith that, in the event of a general rising by the rebels, with which the existing forces might be unable to cope, or if there should be any withdrawal of the military Forces by the Government, then the ulster Volunteer Force should be armed with their own weapons, which are now under Military Control,  the Members of that force who have already joined the special constabulary force being armed first, if the Arms provided by the State are insufficient for the whole Force. Meanwhile,  these Arms should be more distributed among the different Military centres in the six counties&apos;, so as to be available for local issue, and the U.V.F. should be permitted to drill.

(j) Government regulations dealing with Motor Traffic, restriction of movements by night, and reprisals for destruction of Government property, should be put into force as soon as it can be done effectively, but it should not be applied tc the loyal portions of Ulster until they can also be made effective in the more disaffected part of the six Counties.

(k) Steps should be taken to remove all Government officials from their appointments if they refuse to take the Oath of Allegiance, and local Authorities should be instructed  to give notice to all their Employees who decline to pass this test.

Mr Balfour (who had to leave before the close of the Conference) stated that while he could offer be opinion on details he considered that in face of the terms of the Home Rule Bill the Government would be justified in separating Ulster administratively at once from the rest of Ireland. He was, however,  doubtful about the proposal to place the Belfast Military Command directly under the far Office.


Sir Sobert Home considered it to be desirable toenrol a bod;/ of Special, Constables, in Ireland at oneo.rhe dis-cussion was adjourned until the chief secretary could be present.
THE LORD MAYOR OF YORK

(4)Mr Balfour informed, the Conference that in view of the strong representations which had been made for the release of the lord Mayor of Cork from Prixton Gael, he had conferred with the Rome secretary end the Secretary of State for War. In the view of the Home Office the detention of a prisoner during a protracted hunger strike until his death was subversive of prison discipline and administration. It could also be urged on behalf of the Lord Mayor that he was a political prisoner and that it was impossible in his case to food him forcibly as had been done with success with other hunger strikers. On the other hand to release him would in effect be equivalent to giving up the Goercion Act recently passed.

The Conference were reminded that the Cabinet had decided against the release of hunger strikers and that this decision had been announced and defended dry the Prime Minister in his pub1ished letter to the Lord Mayor&apos;s sister.

It was agreed to recommend to change in the cabinet decision.

He proposed tc adhere to the positionhitherto taken up 037- the Government and to state thatno raiding of the export profits fund would be allowed!that in tho interests of the general body cf consumersit was preferable that the fund should be paid into theTreasury and in any case this question had already beendecided by 1arllament.

These r.en,all of whom are awaiting trial, were arrestedeither in the act of making murderous attacks upon police or soldiers, or upon direct findclear evidence of complicity In such attacks,or for other very serious offences.    It isclear that they are engaged in a combinedeffort to make their trials impossible, asall of then, though arrested on various dates,commenced to hunger-strike simultaneously onthe llth Augusts.   By this means they have reducedthemselves to  a physical condition which rendersthem unfit for trial, and the Government are advised that it is legally impossible to try then,for the grave offences with which they are -charged in their absence or until they arecertified to be fit to undergo trial.   But fortheir refusal to take food they would now all have been tried and would be tried forthwith ifthey consented to take food as soon as theyhad sufficiently recovered.The evidence In each case has received most careful individual consideration.    It is impossiblefor the Government to allow men charged withsuch grave offences to escape trial by their ownact*    If this were permitted there would be anend to any possibility of the enforcement oflaw and the administration of justices

Bonar Lav/, P. p.,Lord Privy Seel.The Eight Hon. a. Chamberlain,. M.. P. ,Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Eight Hon. Sir Haioar Gresiwood,Bart. ,K.C. ,M. P. , Chief Secretaryfor Ireland.General Sir Nevil Macready, G.C.M.G. ,K.C.B. , Conauander-in-Chief inIreland.General Blind, Chief of the GeneralStaff in Ireland.The Eight lion. Sir John Anderson, K.C.B.General Tudor, Chief jf the Royal irish constabulary.Lieut./-Colonel Sir M.P.A.Hankey, G.C.B. , Secretary, Cabinet.IERAL (l) TH7 CHIEF S^cRTTaBY reported a great increase in theIf BAT IONI IRELAND,   efficiency of both the Military and rolice sides of theIrish Executive.    He &quot;was confident that the Irish Governmentcould xesters order and bring about peaceful conditions,provided tney continued to have the support of the Govern-ment.
(2) The question of reprisals was discussed in consider-able aetall.The Conference were informed that the Irish executive had held a Conference on this subject and had issued appro-priate orders to the Military and to the Police.    The worstcase was the incident at Balbriggari, and a Police invest! r?a-tion was being held in regard to this.(?) There was complete agreement that reprisals by burning-must he put o stop to at the earliest possible moment.Confidence v/as expressed that reprisals by burning:would generally be put a stop to , although In the exceptionalconditions prevailing in Ireland it could not be guaranteedthat occasional ana spasmodic incidents ox the kind would notoccur.(4) It was hard to stop, in the prevailing conditions inIreland, reprisals in hot blood within a short time oi the murder of a Polios officer or constable.    When the Policeliving in small isolated detachments witnessed the murder of a,comrade, it was difficult to prevent thorn from taking reprisal;;assainst the local Finn Fein leaders, who were perfectly wellknown to them as the heads of local murder gangs.The question was then discussed as to -whether it wouldnot be advisable to enforce some form oi martial law in Ire-land.    It was pointed out that under martial law, when assas-sinations occurred, appropriate steps could he taken inaccordance with official warnings issued beforehand, and inthis way reprisals could be kept under official control.The war of 1670 and the recent War afforded many instances of Jthe success of reprisals in this form.In the course of the discussion it transpired that even the unauthorised reprisals had unquestionably had avisivle effect both in enabling the Executive to obtain
information about ambushes and plots, and in driving a wedge between the moderates and the extremists in the Sinn Feincamp. The Conference were informed that the orders for checking reprisals included instructions that when a murder was committed, every possible step was to be taken for hunting down the murderer.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY reported that he was having corn-piled a complete list of all the reprisals that had been undertaken with full particulars.

&lt;???&gt;

(5) The Chief Secretary was asked to consider a proposal Which had been made in a letter received by the prime Minister that some of the Police should be put into plain Clothes, since at present they were recognised a long distancs offs and malefactors at once made off.

&lt;???&gt;

(o) It was explained to the Conference that one of the most difficult, problems which the Irish Executive had to deal with was the control of motor cars. The majority of the murders were undertaken not by persons conveyed from the localities in which they occurred, bat by persons conveyed from a long distance in motor ears. It was not advisable to stop private motor traffic altogether, as the Sinn Feiners would then know that the only motor cars met on the road belonged to the Military and the Police, and mines and traps would be laid. The same objection applied to stopping supplies of petrol, a proposal was under consideration for the establishment of barricades and controls on the roads, but the numbers of the Military and Police were not sufficient to cover all the roads.
(7)        PRIM MINISOBR stated that he had received atelegram from the Dublin Conference of Conciliations askingif he would receive a Deputation.   He wished to consult hiscolleagues on the subject.It was agreed(a) That there would be advantages in thePrime Minister&apos;s receiving a Deputationduring the week commencing October 10th:ib) That a Meeting oi the Cabinet to considerIrish Policy generally should be held before that date.(8) The Conference had a short discussion with regard tothe Chief secretary Memorandum (Paper C.p.-18Q1) on the refusal of reil^yrren to carry-Police, Military and munitions.The Conference generally concurred that the chief secretary&apos; s view was right in principle ? that it was absurdthat the Government should continue to subsidise, at the&apos;ei-pense of the general body oi tax-payers, the shareholdersof a Railway Company that refuses to carry Government traffic ?or to provide funds wherewith to pay increased wages to thevery men who refused to handle the traffic.The Chief Secretary was asked to see theMinister of Transport in order to ascer-tain the precise position in regard tothe powers of the Government on thiscusstxcn.(9) THE CHIEF SECRETARY pointed out that whatever settle-toent was made in Ireland, the men of the Royal Irish Constabu-lary had to continue to live there.    Me considered the pro-vision in the Government of. Ireland 15ill, under which the menof the Royal Irish Constabulary would have 10 years added tothe time they had serveu lor pension if compulsorily retired/and 5 years in the event of voluntary retirements was inade-quate.   He considered that every man should have 15 yearsadded.
, This led to a short discussion on the general financialerranpensents &quot;for the Dill.tflDENOS (10) In reply to the Chief Secretary, who expressed theTHE IRISHVSRNMSNT.    hope that the Irish Executive had the British Governmententirely behind them in their efforts, THE PRIMS MINISTERstatea that there was no doubt or this.    The British Govern-meat considered that the Irish Executive was tackling a very-.1 If .iieuIt task with pi&apos;eat courage.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 1, 1920.
