iiEAGtJE CP (1) With reference to Cabinet 52 (EC), conclusion b,grfhish Re-the Cabinet had under further consideration the questionKeeli^   0&quot; th&quot; Britl8h ^presentation at the forthcoming meetingof Assembly.    0f tho Assembly of the League of Nations, in view of LordGrey&apos;a inability  (on grounds of health)  to accept the PrimeMinister&apos;s invitation.In this  connection the question was raised as towhether the Prime Ministers of the various countries shouldnot attend a fev meetings of tho forthcoming Session of theAssombly.The question was remitted, for exam-iiiation and report,  to  The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The President cf the Board of Education.Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary).(2)      The Prime Minister undertook to approachMr Barnes on the re--assembly of P.;-.-.&quot;.iu-morit,  and to invite him c&quot;) become one ofthe British repren sir.:.;-; hives --it the meet-ing of the Assembly of the League.INTERIM REPORT      (3) Yiith reference to Cabinet 54 (20), Conclusion 4, the[OF TBS UhlEM-j&amp;CYMENT COM- Cabinet resumed the outstanding recommendations containedin fV^- Interim Report of the Unemployment Committee, i.e.,the question of utilising the Road Improvement Fund moneysand of setting up an Executive Committee to supervise anddeal with provincial Road Schemes.The. Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that lie v/jahedat the outset to uako a suggestion with a view to a possibleshortening o,p the discussion.    After reminding tho Cabinetthat he had withdrawn his claim to the proceeds oi the motor Tax on the express condition that no claims shouldhe made in future on the Exchequer in respect of roads, heindicated that, in his view, the original bargain should be strictly maintained, but that,  in order to enable the Minis-fjTy 0.* Transport to carry out the pledges given to LocalAuthorities (which could not otherwise be satisfied if the
Unemployment Committee&apos;a proposals were adopted),  arrangements should be made by which the Treasury should lend to tho road fund the amounts necessary from tim--  to time to meet theclaims of particular Local Authorities, such amounts to be repaid in due course from later Road Fund receipts.On the other hand,  it was maintained on behalf ofthe Ministry of Transport that the revenue of the Road fund was quite unlike ordinary revenue.      It was a contributionmade by the mechanical users of roads for a definite specif-lc purpose, and was given on the distinct understandingthat it would bo used by way of grants in aid to LocalAuthorities.    The whole arrangements had been carried outon the basis of the agreements originally made with the motor users, and, in the result,  grants for future years for road improvements,  e.g., widenings, contributions towardscost cf new arterial roads, bridges, etc., throughout thewhole country would not exceed  1,250,000 annually.    Itmight be possible to meet the difficulties o f the situation by providing  4,000,000 in ail from the Road Fund,  subject .to the condition that contributions were made by LocalAuthorities in all cases, or that, failing such contributions-tions, direct grants were made fror: the Exchequer, . assuming that a 4-0 per cent, contribution was obtained either fromthe Local Authorities or the Treasury on these lines, a sumof  5,500,000 would then be available for expenditure onunemployment in the troublesome areas, cf which  4,000,000would come out of the Road Fund.It was pointed out that any arrangement for theprovision o* funds which was made conditional on contribu-tions being made by local Authorities, was open to tho veryserious objection that the Authorities in London eithercould not contribute,  or, if they could, would have verygreat difficulty in raising the necessary money, havingregard tc the prior claims of Housing.    It was thought,however, that while there would be little chance Of getting
contributions from the London County Council *v the London&apos;&quot;Borough Councils,  it should not be difficult to persuade theHome Counties to cake contributions.    In the latter cases itwas urged that the financial difficulty might be removed ifthe money could be lent by the Government to the authority on terms which would secure that the latter paid the same rate of interest as the Government was liable to pay, andrepaid the capital by instalments.It was then pointed out that even if some such ar-rangement as contemplated above was made, the money availablefor the London Area would be insufficient, as it would give only  3,250,000, whereas the Committee had contemplated theexpenditure of  4,503,000.It was then suggested that, as the works were admit-tedly relief works, the labour on which would be more ineffi-clent and costly than would be the case if the roads had been built in the ordinary way, it would be right for the exchequer-quer to make a contribution equivalent to the additional cost, estimated at 30 per1 cent., due to the inefficientcharacter of the labour.As regards the provincial programme,  the same diffi-culty did not arise, inasmuch as the Road Fund money,  plusJ;he local   contributions, would give adequate funds.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Ministry of Transport should arrange to anticipate the aggregate RoadImprovement Programme of  4,000,000 for1920/23, of which about  2,COO,000 canbe apportioned to works in the london area&quot; and  2,000,000 for the Provinces:(b) That the Treasury should extend every facility to the Ministry of transport in the way of either lending money as and when necessary to th&quot;? department or approving the borrowing by the De-partment of funds in the open market to enable them to do  this withoutcurtailing their maintenance contribu-t i o n p r o gr amm e:(c) That, having regard to the fact thatthe labour would be inefficient.,  theTreasury should make a free contribu-tion to the Ministry of Transport notexceeding 30 per cent, of the norm...!
p 7 9cost of the several vforka, as a contributions-tion in relief of unemployment       &amp; specialvote being taken for this purpose:(d) That every effort should be made to persuade the Local Authorities concerned to contributetoK-arda the schemes, and that in any casevrhere an Authority agreed to contribute but was unable to find the necessary funds, ar-ranger-enta should be made for the exchequer to lend such funds to the Ministry of Trans-port, which, in turn, should lend them tothe Authority at the same rate of interest at th* -Treasury had to pay.  tha money to ber**-*und*d by the Ministry of Transport to theTreasury as and when recovered from theAuthority by annual instalments or other-wise:(0) That Sir Henry Meybury should at once get into touch -with tho Local Authorities con-earned, and snd savour to mak? arrangementsttlth them for contributions on the lines indicated above.The Cabinet thftn proceeded to consider the recommend-atten of the Unemployment Committee that an Executive Com-mlttse ohou2.d be set up to deal with provincial Road Schemes.It was explained that the necessity for such a Commit-toe lay in the fact that overlapping and delay mere occasionedthrough five or six Departments being concerned.Aftar some &apos; discussion it was agreed ****That a Cor-mittee of the Cabinet, with Sir L.Worthington rvans in the Chair, should besat up,&quot;consisting of Ministerial Repreaent-ativos of -The Treasury,The Ministry of Labour,The Ministry of Transport,The Ministry of Health,The Scottish Office,to co-ordinate the relief works in London andthe Provinces in referenc- to unemployment.iORKMEN&apos;S (4) The Cabinet had befora them the follomlng documentsOMPBNSATIOH.on the subject of ^orteen&apos;s Compensation:-A i-demorandum by the Home Secretary4 covering report of Departmental Corxittea (Paper C.P.-M**TJorandi6 by th* Minister of Health (PapersC.P.-1788 and O.P,-lflW):A Keworandun by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper CP,-1780) .Tho question v; a a r emit ted&apos;, inthe first instance, to theConoaittee on Home Ari.vs ,

IRISH RAILWAYMEN.

(1) With reference to Cabinet 47 (20), Conclusion 8, the Cabinet was reminded of the nature of the government guarantee under which the Irish Railway Companies were entitled to have their net receipts made up to the 1913 net receipts. It had been suggested that if the Irish Railways continued to refuse to carry Government traffic, pressure might be put upon them by stopping payment under the guarantee. The English Law Officers, however, had adviced that stoppage of payment could not be legally effected, and it would be necessary ? to introduce special legislation or to continue payment as hithe? to. The Minister of Transport had consulted with the Irish Secretary, and it had been decided that, while it would be a mistake to close down the railways entirely, it was advisable to close down those lines In the South and West which were not paying their out-of-pocket  expenses. At the same time, the lines which remained open should have Government traffic tendered to them, and should be directed to dismiss or suspend without pay any railwaymen who refused to deal with such traffic. In the event of the railways failin to carry out this arrangement, the Irish Government should be granted power by Order In Council to shut down such railways. Further, it was proposed that in due course Parliament should be asked to grant the Ministry of Transport power to cancel particular Railway Agreements, so that the shareholders of any railways closed down in Ireland would have their dividends stopped. A threat to stop payment of dividends might have a very salutary in fluence on the railway situation in Ireland. It was suggested that it might be possible to divert Exchequer grants towards ? the Irish railway deficits but, on the other hand, it was pointed out that most of th? grants were already diverted to other purposes.

The Cabinet agreed--

To accept tge recommendations of the Minister of Transport and the Chief Secretary for Ireland fox dealing with the Irish Railway situation.


The Minister of Transport undertook-   t to consider the alternative suggestionthat payment to Irish Railway Companiesunder the Railway Agreements should &quot;be(-) recovered out of any available Irishw Ex ohe quer gr ant a.jJVEILING OF (8)  The Cabinet had a brief discussion as to the Dro-BBI PERMANENT -ENOTAPK. seedings to be adopted in regard to the formal unveilingof the Cenotaph.The following alternatives had been suggested:-(i) That His Majesty should unveil the Cenotaphwithout ceremony:(ii) That a hymn, such as &quot;C God, our help inages past&quot;, should be sung, followed by aperiod of silence:(iii) That a short Service, followed by speeches,should take place, the proceedings in anyease to end with the sounding of the &quot;LastPost&quot; after a silence of two minutes.The Cabinet were reminded that the Cenotaph was an imperial monument commemorating men of many races and orociand it was accordingly thought undesirable that the unveil-ing ceremony should have any distinctive denominationalflavour.The eenaral view of the Cabinet may be summed up asfollows :-(a) That the function should begin with theplaying of the National Anthem, when HisMajesty arrived, that a hymn should thenbe flung, &quot;0 God, our help in ages pasoKbeing favoured: that this should be fol-lowed by a silence of one minute, after which the &quot;Last Post&quot; should be sounded:(b) That, If the above suggestion was approvedby Pis Majesty, steps should be taken to notify the responsible authorities through-out the Empire with a view to a similarceremony in cases where this was thought desirable, or at any rate a siJence of.one minute, being observed, as on theoccasion of the unveiling of the tempo r-ary Cenotaph.8, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 14, 1920,
