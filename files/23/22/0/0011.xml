istancefte*$t. Livgel.(1) With reference to Cabinet 47 (20),   Conclusion 4,  theattention of the Cabinet was drawn to the British HighCommissioner at Constantinople *s telegram No. 926 (R),  dated august 16, 1920,  stating that Admiral de Robe.ok had beeninformed by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief that hewas not permitted to give any kind of assistance to theforces of General Wrange1 without the sanction of the warOffice,   and asking that the War Office should be suitablyapproached on the subject.Doubt having been expressed as to the meaning of the telegram, it was suggested that reference was possibly madeto certain Bulgarian rifles which had been collected anddeposited at Constantinople and were temporarily in Britishcharge.    In this connection the Cabinet were reminded that instructions had been sent, in accordance with Conclusion 4of Cabinet 47 (20), that these rifles were not to be movedpending further orders.    The French were under the impression that they were entitled to make use of these rifles  - a viev.which was shared by the Military Section of the naval,Military and Air Council in Paris   and were in all probably-ility proposing to hand them over- to General Wrangel. It was clear, however, that the permission of all the Allies wasnecessary before the rifles could be released;    and it wasagreed  That the Secretary of State  for ForeignAffairs  should be asked to enquire further into the matter, ftPIt subsequently transpired that the telegramunder discussion referred to Medical Supplies.RUSSIA.Resumptionof TradingRelations .(2) with reference to Cabinet 33  (20), Appendix I (4),the attention of the Cabinet was further directed to an opencommunication to the Prime Minister from M. Kameneff, whichhad appeared in the Press that morning.    The Cabinet were informed that evidence existed showing that 11. Kameneff andJt. Kwasain had,  during their present mission to London,indulged in propaganda and generally been guilty of conduct
which was not compatible with the conditions under which theirMission had been permitted to proceed to England.    It was sug-gested that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should write to       Kameneff pointing out that the recent activitiesof himself and his Mission violated the obligations into whicbthey entered when they came to Pngland, and asking for an ex-explanation.    A further proposal &apos;?as made that a completedossier should be prepared, disclosing hew the Soviet Mission,acting under instructions from the Bolshevist Government, hadabused its privileged Position, and that this dossier shouldbe published to the world through the medium of a newspaperin a neutral country.    In this connection the view was ex-pressed that -&quot;--he tine had arrived to take definite proceed-ings against certain revolutionary organs in this country which were known to be subsidised from Moscow and which con-gtl+u+ed a  po*&quot;&quot;tidable danger to the State,  o&apos;&quot;inr to the skil-ful manne** in which &quot;&quot;evolutionary doctrines were disseminatedamong the working-classes generally, and the servants of theState in particular.After some discussion it was agreed  (a) That it was undesirable that the SovietMission should be given its centre&apos; at thepresent moment, and that the Gove-nmentshould wait until the situation in Polandhad further developed, when the bona fidesor othe &quot;wise of the Bolshevist Governmentwould be fully established:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,  in consultation with the PomeSecretary, should prenare for the ap-prcval of the Prime Minister a draft ofa communication to the Russian Delega-tion requiring an explanation of thebreaches of the conditions on which theywere received in this county.It was decided after the meeting by the PrimeMinister,  in consultation with L&apos;r Eonar Lawand the Foreign Sec-e&quot;ary, that the actualpresentation of the communication to M.Kameneff should be delayed for the present.-a-
IsSIA. (3) With-reference,to Cabinet 47  (20),  Conclusion 3, theii/lo-Krone/h -- Sec-e+rarv of State for Foreign Affairs info &quot;toed the Cabinetllatlons .that he had been in communication durine the last week withthe British Ambassador in Paris and with the French Charged&apos;Affaires in London in respect of the announcement of theFrench Government that they intended to support Generalangel, and that he had  just   received a letter fro.&quot; lord derby on the subject.    It appeared that the French Governmentwere conscious of their mistake arid wanted to make an amende.;and,  as the French Government  could hardly be expected toapologise or completely to withdraw from their position,Lord Derby, at the instance of if..  Pal eclogue, had asked him(Lord Curaon) to suggest 3oae formula which would meet thecase.    He had telephoned the previous day to Lord Derbysaying that the only practical thin? was for the French torecommend the Poles to accent the terms offered,  if these terms secured their independence&quot;    and,  second,  that theFrench should inform. General Wrange 1 that if the terms to thePoles were reasonable and accepted, the French Governmentwould refrain from rendering General Wrangel any further assistance.    Lord Curson then read out two drafts which hadbeen prepared by K. Paleologue (but had not yet been submittedto If. Hi lie-and) and which had been forwarded by lord Derby.The first was to the effect that if the Soviet  Governmentoffers to Poland reasonable conditions securing the political independence and the ethnographical integrity of their countryin accordance with the Lympne agreement, the French would useall their influence to get Poland to accept.    The second draft was in the sense that, in case reasonable terras were obtained at Minsk, the Government of the Republic would use their influence with General Wrangel to get him to accept similarte^ms, and they would not pi-e him. military suppct unless he had to defend himself a pa ins t an attack by the Red Army;and,  further,  that,  any support that was sent would no   be inthe form of French t-troops.    These drafts,  Lord Cu&quot;aon thought,
indicated a rather notable advance on the part of the French,having regard, to their previous attitude.Considerable discussion followed,  in the course  ofwhich it was suggested that the natter should be left foe--the present where it stood.    Events were moving rapidly, andthe next few days would prove whether or not the Russianawere acting in good faith   a point which had always been strongly disputed by the French,    The moment for any attemptto compose the difference between the French and ourselveswas not ripe.    Moreover  every new declaration merely tended to emphasise the great and radical difference between therespective point s of view of the two nations ,    On the othef&quot;-hand it was pointed out that the formula of M. Paleologuereproduced very closely a sentence in the recent speech ofthe  Prime Minister in parliament,  and that if the French were at once to use their influence with the Poles with a view toinducing them to act in the way suggested by the British Q.-o&apos;7-ernment, this could hot fail to have a most, favourable effect upon the negotiations  shortly to be conducted at Minsk.    Insupport of the forme.&quot;&apos; proposition attention was drawn, to thegeneral position,  and the possible developments during thenext two or three weeks.    There  could be no doubt that theFrench had always in view their intention ultimately to occupy/the Ruhr Valley.    The correspondence which had  just been communicated to the Cabinet showed no real de-sire to makeamends?    it more probably covered a diplomatic manoeuvrethe object of which was to appear to defer to the british point of view in respect of Poland in order that,  later,this concession might be utilised to induce the British&apos; togiye way on the Ruhr question.    Was it in the British interest at. the present moment to try and compose the differences,  orto say frankly to the French that the latter had broken severalagreements and that the fact must be accepted that a realdivergence of view existed?    Within the last few days, indespite of the Boulogne agreement and without, any referenceto the British Government, the French had made a public
JL i-^ ooomraunication to the United States Govesnraerit which emphas Izedstill further this divergence.The general trend of opinion was that events shouldbe allowed to take their course for the present,  and that lord Derby should approve neither of the proposed formulae .The Prime Minister undertook,  in thecourse of his  journey through Pa&quot;ison the following day, to acquaint LordBe-by vri+b the views of the &quot;Cabinet.(4) The Cabinet had under consideration a Paper by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-1777)  on thesubject of the question of a Middle Eastern Department,stating that there appeared to be general agreement,   (1) thatit was impracticable at present to create a new Ministry forthe Middle East,   (2) that there was no space in which to house a new Department,   (3) that it was impossible to severfrom the Foreign Office countries or areas at present underForeign Office control,   (.4)  that Egypt, the Sudan, Palestine,Arabia, Aden and Mesopotamia should be assigned to a new organisation with a staff specially collected for the purnose,(5) that it was probably desirable that a new Middle Eastservice should be  created. The Paper pointed out that if itwere impossible to create a new Ministry, the two alternativesremaining were,  (a) to appoint a new Parliamentary Secretary,(b) to appoint the existing Parliamentary Secretary as theHead of the new Department, and expressed the view that itwas generally agreed that for the time being the said Depart-ment must be placed in the Foreign Office.    Summed up, theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposals were:     (a) that a new Departmentbe created as from October 1 next,   (b) that  if a new Under-Sec reta rj be not  appointed to the Department, Mr Harmsworthbe invited to assume charge,  (c) that he be given a non-Po-elim Office staff, draw, from the countries concerned.In the course of the discussion which ensued, several ministers stated that the proposals of the Foreign Secretarywere based upon assumptions in which Mm colleagues did notconcur.
STRUCT 10 IISTO SIR percy cox.It fas agreed  and . That the further discussion of the trues-&quot;&quot;tion should be a d journed/for the present theexisting arrangements should be continued.(5) The Secretary of State for India stated that,  inaccordance with Conclusion 1 of Finance Committee Minutes 25,Draft Instructions had been prepared for the guidance of sir percy Cox, and these had been laid before the Pri:ne Minister.After a brief discussion it. was agreed, at the PrimeMinister&apos;s suggestion  (a) That Sir Percy Cox, as high Commissioner,was to endeavour to give effect to thepolicy of His Majesty1s Government inMesopotamia as publicly/ declared:(b) That,   subject to this, the Instructions(with the except-ion of Ho. 9, which shouldbe eliminated) be approved generally, butthat they should be regarded by Sir percy cox as intended for his personal use and guidance only and as an indication ofHis Ma testy&apos;s Government&apos;s conception ofthe general lines on which he should pro-ceed,  and as not intended for publication.MESOPOTAMIA^RAILWAYS.(6) The Secretary of State for ITar ashed whether theCabinet approved of his pushing on the rail/ays in Mesopotara-ia, the construction of which he had urged as an imperativenecessity in various Papers which had been circulated to hiscolleagxae s .It was agreed  (a) That railway construction in Mesopotamiashould be  suspended until Sir Percy Coxhad returned, to that country and had had time to report on the situation:(b) That the Secretary of State for War should arrange for the necessary hutments to be constructed In Mesopotamia and Persia forthe accommodation and protection of our troops in those countries during the coming winter.ItJBUST RIAL (7) With reference to Conclusion 2 of Finance CommitteeSIT CAT 10IIARISING OUT 37, the Cabinet were informed that the result of the Miners&apos;OF THE DECI-STON OF Tttf,     strike Ballot would bo known on the 30th. of the presentHITTERS&apos;  FED-eRATTON TO       month, and that on the following day the miners&apos;  loadersTAKE a STRIKEBALLOT. would meet the Triple Alliance in order to discuss their future action.    The ballot would probably result in a
1 p&quot;JL.        t^rlarge majority in favour of a strike,  although it was possi-ble that a considerable number of miners were not reallyanxious to drop work.    It oeemed unlikely that any big strikecould materialise before September 15.    The Supply and T-ans-port Committee of the Cabinet, which was charged with theorganisation of Government measures to meet a possibles*rike, v*as meeting constantly and was actively engaged inmaking the necessary preparations.    Meanwhile, the miners were equally active,  on their part,  in making arrange2r,entsfor food supplies and for the distribution of propaganda.Cabinet authority was required for the Propaganda Sub-Commit-tee of the Supply and Transport Committee to start its functions,  and also for the provision of accc-amodation forthe Committee in the courtyard behind the Ministry of Fduca-tion.   An exceptionally troublesome and bitter stru^r-le wasto be anticipated!    in fact,  it might turn out to be the crucial contest with Labour,  and the Government were bound tomake the best possible preparations to meet the crisis.In reply to a question, the attitude of the TransportWorkers and Railwaymen was stated to be at present uncertain.The Cabinet took note of and approved the following action:-(a) By the Chancellor of the Exchequer, instruct-ing Treasury officials to regard the situation arising out of a big industrial crisis,  suchas was threatened by the impending coal strike,as comparable to a. state of war,  and authorising-ing them to make financial provision accordingly:fb) By the Supply and Transport Committee, appoint-ing the  Right Eon. F.G. Kellaway, M.P., anadditional member of the Committee,  and asthe Committee&apos;s Chief Civil Commissioner, inthe place of hlr L. -Tor thing ton Evans,  resigned:(c) By the President of the Board of Education,releasing to the Propaganda Sub-Comroittee ofthe Supply and Transport Committee the premises in the courtyard behind the Ministry of Educa-tion.It was further agreed  To authorise the Supply and Transport Com-mittee to initiate such, preliminary action as might, in their view, he essential inorde&quot;* to meet certain contingencies.

JJLPERSIA AND (1)    The- Commiirbee wer-e- &quot;jiformed that, since- the- last,.*?ESOPOtffcMIA-.neetlng the situation both in Persia and Mesopotamia hadeased considerably.    With regard to Persia, the latesttelegrams from MrlJorraan had. made the position clearer anddemonstrated that the Persian Government honestly intendedto summon Parliament at an early date with a view to the ratification cf the Anglo-Persian Agreement.    Similarly,the military situation was brighter, and order was beingrapidly restored in Northern Persia.    The Persian Governmentwas In need of money, and it was suggested that permissionmight be given to make small advances,  the amount of whichmight be deducted, from the balance of the loan te bo made onthe ratification of the Agreement.    The British forces in persia should be maintained and if necessary strengthenedso as to enable, them to assist in the pacification of north persia.    The situation In Mesopotamia was also better, andit was urged that Sir Percy Cox should be sent out withoutdelay with a view to solving the question by giving theinhabitants the kind of Government and ruler they desired.In this connection the Committee were informed that atthe Conference at Lympne our difficulties in Mesopotamiahad been explained, and the French had been told that, Inthe event of the Arabs asking for the appointment of Faisalas Emir, it was the intention of the British Governmentto raise no difficulty in the way of such an appointment.The French had protested very strongly against the adoptionof this proposal) and had gone so far as to say that theywould regard it as on unfriendly act.    It was clear thatFeisal&apos;s appointment would have to bo made by the BritishGovernment on their own responsibility and without Frenchconcurrence,    It was more than possible that Sir percy cox would find that different forms of Government were required in different areas in Mesopotamia,  and that theAr^b3 at first might not wish for a single ruler.
Under the proposed Mandate,  a period of two yearsroust elapse before the organic law had to be submitted to theLeague of Nations,  and possibly by the expiration of thattime opinion in Mesopotamia would have coalesced in favour ofPelsal, and French opposition to him might have died dorm.The Secretary of State for Far and the Chief of theImperial General Staff again repeated their strong objectionson military grounds to tho retention of the British troopsin Persia.    Tho proposal that the Persian Parliament should consider the Anglo-Persian Agreement in three months1  time was one which afforded no finality, unless,  indeed,  thoAgreement was rejected, when our troops could be withdrawn.If the Agreement was ratified, military occupation must boprolonged for a considerable time,  in order that opportunity should bo given for the organisation of tho Persian forces;and,  in this event, under the -most favourable conditionswithdrawal could not take effect until at least six months from the  date of ratification.    Mot only wo\ild   It bo noces-sary to provide the troops with proper accommodationduring the winter, but they would remain in Persia in great danger from tho Bolsheviks or from tho local tribes, and itwould be most difficult to effect a rescue.    If it wasdecided not to withdraw tho troops, then the V.&apos;ar office should be   authorised to provide winter accommodation and toarrange for reinforcements sufficiently strong to ensurethe security of the troops in Persia until they were with-drawn.    Hore drivers and transport would bo required, and itmust bo remembered that wo had no available white troops,and therefore native troops from India must fye  sent.    Thebalance of native troops over white troops was   already veryunfavourable, and tho native troops thought that they werebeing exploited,,In reply to a question, Sir Percy Cox stated that theAnglo-Persian Agreement vn.fi not unpopular in Persia except
in certain extremist and interested circles.    He himself was doubtful as to the necessity for reinforcements foi the troopsin Persia.    In his opinion,   judging from Mr. IF or man&apos; s reeettelegrams there vias ground to hope that the Persian parliament would ratify the r.ngl &amp;-Persian Agreement in October, v ithcertain reservations,   such as limiting it to 15 years and an alteration of the preamble,  ohioh would not -be unacceptable to us.in the subsequent discussion it appeared tnat thenumber of troops  in Persia on ration strength was somethingbetween 10,000 and 13,000 inall,  and that these forces werecosting about  3,500,000 per annum, which, of course, must beincreased by the cost of winter accommodation and of anyreinforcements which it might be necessary to send,It was pointed out that the evacuation of Persia wouldprobably mean the sotting up of hostile forces on thePersian-Afghanistan frontier,  and possibly endangering thePersian oilfields *    While, no doubt, the proper line ofdefence of India was the North-West Frontier, the sotting upof a Bolshevist Government in Persia would undoubtedly reacton Afghanistan*In reply to a question, Sir Percy Cox said that in hisopinion a separate Department for the  administration of middle -Eastern affairs should be established.    Ho thoughtthat no existing Department of State could properly do thework.    Until the personnel of the new Department hadsettled down, he thought that such personnel should be attachedto the Foreign Office.    Pending any arrangements being made,he assumed that the Secretary of State for   India would continue to take responsibility for Mesopotamia^(At this point the Experts withdrew.)After some further discussion, in the course of whichthe arguments for and against the evacuation of Persia were summarised by the Prime Minister, the Committee decided - -the Secretary of State for War dissenting - -
(a) That the British forces in Persia should not&apos; he withdrawn, hut should he maintained at^ their present strength until the result ofthe discussion in the Persian parliament 6nthe question of the ratification of the Anglo-persian Agreement was known.(b) That sir Percy cox should proceed as soon aspossible to Mesopotamia,  to take up the dutiescf high commissioner at Baghdad.(c) That the instructions to be given to Sir percy cox should be submitted to the Prime Ministerfor approval before sir Percy&apos;s departure.At this stage the Minister of Transport,   the HomeSecretary, the president of the Board of Trade and theSecretary for Scotland arrived from a meeting of the Supplyand Transport Committee.SITUATION (2)    With reference to Cabinet 45 (So),  Conclusion 2,  the ill SING)&apos;C? OP THE     Finance committee were  informed of the decision just reached12 CI SI ON CPCF.-T MINERS&apos;    by the Miners&apos; Federation to take a ballot in favour of a11 ORATION11 TAKE A       strike,   and,  in the event of a strike,  to appeal to the otherHIEL7L0T. members cf the Triple Alliance for support.    The ballot paperswould be in by August 3lst,  when the prime Minister wouldprobably oe approached with a view to seeing whether theGovernment would make any further offer.    in the event of no-offer being made,   a strike might be anticipated in the first-r second week of September.    The determining factors whichhad influenced, the Federation were,   no doubt,   the decisions with regard to the Bread subsidy,  the Irish troubles and thedecision to increase the railway fares.It was suggested that the moment had now arrived whenthe strike operations of the Supply and Transport Committee3hould begin.    It  was also represented that Pa.rliomr.ent  shouldbe invited forthwith to give the Government powers to deal withthe situation by passing the Emergency Powers Bill *The chairman of the Supply and Transport Committeesaid that his committee could do nothing further until openaction could be taken.
X3 c oIt \:1 s pointer&quot;1, out thr.t without legislation Itpould not bo possible to make arrangements for pumpingtho mines and maintaining the electric light stations.The Government wore in a weaker position, in many respectsChan cn -he Occasion of tne raJLIw.^ strike, and it m ightbo necessary to bring back 10 or 12 Battalions from &quot;Ir-ed-andw,and to withdraw the troops on the Rhine, except, perhaps,one Battalion.    Moreover two white Battalions might be withdrawn from Constantinople.    On the other hand, itwas stated that any attempt at the moment to pass theEmergency Powers B.111 would provoke most violent opposition  -&quot;from Labour, and would do much to precipitate the crisis.Further, the adjournment of Parliament had been postponed for a specific purpose, and It might be difficult tojustify keeping the House sitting for another week todeal with the Bill *    It would be better to rely on theinhererrt p-o we-r-s -olP-iJ^e-Kbrtr-Tr^ from parliament afterwards.    If necessary,  P rliament could  always be urgently summoned, when the crisis had arisen, to pass the emergency legislation..The Finance Committee decided to recommend tothe Cabinet t-(a) That no emergency legislation should be proceeded with befone the (adjoxirrunont ofParliamentj(b) That,  In the event of further powers being required,  the Cabinet should consider laterwhether to exercise such powers and obtain an indemnity thereafter, or tc  summon Par-liamont with a view to the passage of theEmergency Powers Bill:(c) That in tho meantime the Supply and transport committee should not take open measures tomeet tho  crisis until the -natter was further considered by the Cabinet,,The Prime Minister undertook to consider the selection of suitable personnel forthe conduct of Government prop  Uganda.
JiT^SS RATAL (3)    With reference to Finance Cor^iirtee-r- -23rd. Minutes,Conclusion 5, the Committee had before them a Memorandum &quot;bythe First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper F.0.-47) relative tothe Dockyard disoharges.It was agreed - -(a) That the Dockyards should arrange theirdischarges on the basis of  securing adischarge of not 13ss than 80 a week  from now until the end of October, 1920:(b) That the question should,  if necessary, bofurther considered by the Finance Committee assoon -as possible after the Recess.jfOR^S IN (4)    The Committee had under consideration a MemorandumPIlestinf, .by the Secretary of State for War (Paper CP.-1669) giving&apos;the minimum War Office requirements for land purchase and accommodation in Palestine for the coming; winter..On the understanding that the expenditure would belimited to essentials necessary for the health and comfortof the troops, the. Committee decidedTo approve the proposals specified inparagraph 6 of the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1August 12th.  1920.

The Prime Minister,  corrtiruaing, said that the terns,were not nearly so severe as had been imposed by theAllies upon Germany and Austria, and he did not think thatGreat Britain could make war in order to secure bettorconditions than those.      There were two things which required decision.      First, was this communication to besubmitted tc France, with or without an expression ofopinion by His Majesty&apos;s Government?   If it was decidedto transmit it,what comment should the British Governmentmake?      Second, should) It be sent to Poland,  and, If se,should the Government state their opinion of the terms?The Leader of the House had another difficulty to put to the conference but this might be discussed later;  itwas that MrAsquith and Mr.Clynes had both pressed  (a)  thatthe League of Rations should he asked to decide tho termsof Peace between Soviet Russia and Poland., and (b)  that theCabinet should come to no final decision without consultingParliament again.If the terms were communicated to Paris there wasthe danger    that they would ho negatived by the FrenchGovernment.    Tho French almost invariably adopted the negative attitude in the first instance.    Their Representa-tives had come to the Lyripne Conference with the idea -?fasking the British Delegates to agree to the publicationof a proclamation of a most violent and impossible character.France was passionately anti-bolshevist, as the French &quot;had had experience of communism.    The present case had, however,nothing to do   with communism *It was generally agreed, however,,that it was impossible tocommunicate the terms to Poland without submitting themfirst or simultaneously to the French Government,    Tho french were apprehensive that tho terms might include the ostablish-ment of a Soviet Government In Poland with Marshal Pilsndskiat the head of it,  and they would undoubtedly be relieved
to find that the present corrtunlca-tion contained no suchconditions.As regards the terms themselves It was generally agreed that they were as reasonable as could he expected,but that certain items, viz.  the future strength of thePolish Army and the final frontiers night require further examination.    A groat cause of satisfaction was that theconditions secured, the  Independence of Poland and - assuming the bcna-fides of the Soviet Oovernmentand its delegatesit was felt;In London - the British Government could not,/without aserious broach of faith, now proceed with the hostile measurescontemplated at the Lympne Conference,  in the event of affairstakIng a s inister tiirn.On the other hang it was strongly urged that it was essential for the Allies to contemplate the possibility of bad faith -on the part of the Soviets,and attention was drawn to the condition which laid down that all arms over and above such as may be required for   the needs of the reducedArmy,  as well us of the Civic Militia,  shall bo handed overto Soviet Russia and the Ukraine,and it was suggested thatthis might mean that the arms     were required for a Red Amyin Poland.After a further short discussion,  it was decided:-(a)    That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should draft a telegram to the British Ministerat Warsaw, giving: hie the text of the Soviet terms and instructing him to communicate thorn immediately to the Polish Government, with the comment thatPlis Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that pro-vided these tor us are boha-fide offered at Minskand that/substantial addition is made to them,  theywould appear to leave the  independence of Polandwithin her ethnographic frontiers unimpaired;.    theBritish Government could not aa&amp;rm^ responsibilityof taking hostile action agai.....t mnssia if theconditions how offered in their general substanceWere refused; although the Poles were, of course,at liberty to secure by negotiation better termsif they could.
The Secretary 6f State for Foreign affairs should similarly communicate the terms to the &apos;French Government through  the British ambassador in Paris,  stating that the document had beentelegraphed to Far saw end that   the british minister at that capital had. bean instructedin the sense of  (c) above; that the Cabinet,after the Debate in the house of Commons that day, were unanimous In thinking that publicopinion in Parliament and In the country wouldnot justify the British Government in undertakinghostilities against Russia in order to securebetter terms;  and expressing the hope that theFrench Government would bo disposed to givesimilar instructions to their Minister atWarsaw.
1 6 CThe  ?i*laxA Mijoisrte. -said that the&apos;hiextjinHlrfcex&quot;on AhLchhe desired to consult his ooGMeagues was this.    Two queo-tions had been raised by the leader of the Liberal party and by Mr, Glynes, on behalf of the Labour Party, in the debate in tho House of Commons that afternoon.The first of these questions required an immediateanswer.    Mr. Asquith had urged that, from the point of--nd still more so from th-:t of th.:.;- H - use -f C .mm&apos;ny,view of the Government/ when the present negotiationsterminated, Parliament should have an opportunity of re-viewing the situation before any warlike steps were taken .The other suggestion of Mr. Asquith was that the wholequestion ought to bo referred to an impartial and repre-sentative Tribunal and that if the pre..eat negotiationsbroke down, the machinery of the League of Nations shouldbe brought in to deal with the ^situation,,,     The firstsuggestion required an answer that evening.    Tho secondcould be deferred until the following day.   Mr. Lloyd Georgesaid that he himself was afraid of the very serious effectif, owing to the strength of Labour opposition as supportedby Mr. Asquith, he had to summon Parliament again.      TheBolsheviks would be certain to make capital out of it andhe himself was opposed to.giving any such undertaking, atany rate that night.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that Labourwas in a very irritable farame of mind at present, and that pressure outside Parliament might compel the Governmentto give some such undertaking as Mr. Asquith had suggested.The suggestion, indeed, had been made in such a way as toplace the Cover :jr.ent in a false position.    It made it appear as if the Government asked to be the sole judges of the question, and to be empowered to act arbitrarily... and
and thus &quot;to iis^5^^^i^^s^7i-&apos;ybj--of Parlisauent.    Th23-^r%&amp;fiwould^-cert-ailily be shared by a c-o^ai^irahJ-a^msiirt/arof the Government supporters, and a new cry would be raisedthat the House of Commons was not only tame, but that itwas flouted and ignored.        The Government would probablybe in a stronger position if a reply were given in the sense that while they hoped that there would be no break-down in the negotiations, yet if this unfortunately shouldodour,  the House would at once be summoned.The view was expressed that it might be as well to challenge a division and take advantage of a favourablevote in the House that evening - although that vote couldnot be unanimous - in order to  secure general approvalOf the Government policy.    There was no doubt that the atmosphere in and outside Parliament was dead against a newwar, and people were greatly afraid of being dragged intofresh hostilities of any kind.      It was most important thatthe Government should carry Parliament with them, and thatthey should not play into the hands of agitators.    It was difficult for the Government to ask for a blank cheque, andto refuse to give the undertaking sought by Mr. Asquithmight create a bad impression;    such a refusal mightstimulate opposition in the country and increase thedifficulties that were to be anticipated at Minsk.    Itwas suggested that while the Government might be perfectlyjustified in retaining their right to porsevere in theirwarlike preparations in anticipation of the worst,they were not justified in going,beyond those preparationswithout consulting Parliament.It was generally felt that the reply to Mr. Asquithmight be somewhat on the following lines  &quot;The Debate to-day in the House shows that if the contingency arises that Polish independence is...threatened
threatened, the Government have the support of theHouse.    The Government could not undertake totake no action, whatever emergency might arise.It was quite     possible,  that,  in the event of abutcrisis, immediate action might be necessary,/inat once summoned andthat    rase the House would ba/asKed later to accord its approval.TIIt was decidedThat the Prime Minister or the Leader of theHouse should that evening reply to the effectthat he hoped that the Government would notbe pressed that night to give the undertakingas.;ced for by the leaders of the Opposition.If the Opposition were still of the same opinion on Thursday, they might put the samequesticiT. again.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.11th August, 1920.
A I ?E I! 3 II    I.M. JCameneff presents his compliments to the night Hon.Mr. Lloyd ueorge,  and begs to communicate to him the terms ofthe armistice and preliminaries for peace which will be submittedat Minsk by the Russian delegates,    M. kameneff makes the reservation that these terms may be supplemented by detailsof secondary moment.The following are the terms of the armistice and prpeluaidjaaries&apos;for peace with Poland:(1) The strength of the iolish army shall, he reducedto one annual contingent up to 50,0/Ou men,  and the command and administration of the&apos; army to an aggregate of 10,000 men.( ) The demobilisation shall-&apos; take place within one months(&apos;3) All arms over and above such as may be required forthe needs of the army,  as reduced above,  as well as of the civic militia,  shall be handed over to sovietRust: I a and the Ukraine.(4) All war industries shall be demobilised.NO FOREIG-II HELP;(5) No troops or war material shall be allowed tocome from abroad.f G) The line Volkovisk-Bielostok-G-rajewo shall be placedful3y at the disposal of ^ussia for commercialtransit from and to the Baltic.(7) The families of all iolish citizens killed, woundedor incapacitated in the war shall be given landsh free.On the other hand,(1) Parallel with the demobilisation,  the Russian and.Ukrainian troops shall withdraw from the Polishfront.(2) Upon the termination of these operations the number&apos;of Russian troops on the Russian frontier line shallbe considerably reduced,  and fixed at a figure to&apos;be agreed upon.

Bielostok and kholm.
Present:    Mr Bali our , Mr Shortt, Mr Churchill,  Sir E.Blackwell,Mr Philip Kerr, Mr J.C.David son.Mr Shortt explained that that the situation had becomeserious in connection with the case of Mr MeSwiney, Lord Mayorof Cork.    He explained that there was a growing demand on all sides for his  release from Brixton Prison and practically thewhole Press took this line.    That in addition to public opinion there were special circumstances which made a strong case for his release.      In the first place it was a fact and was known to thepublic that the prisoner had been described by the Irish Govern-ment as a political prisoner,  in the second place owing to hisphysical condition he was not amenable to forcible feeding, and inthe third place, the Borne Secretary laid stress on the fact thatthe first act of the very representative body of men under theChairmanship of Sir Nugent Everard,  calling Itself the PeaceConference, which met yesterday in Dublin, had been the passing ofan unanimous resolution urging the Government to release immediately the Lord Mayor of Cork.    The Labour Party also, he pointed out,were agitating for his release.Mr Balfour pointed out that in logic the case against his release was indisputable and that to give in to hunger-striking-meant paralysis of the law.Sir E.Blackwell drew attention to the fact that there -was avery distinct line of demarcation in the public mind between apolitical and criminal prisoner:    that it would be hopeless toattempt to apply the cat and mouse act in this case as McSwinpjy had stated quite definitely that he would  only begin to ea/u agaiiin receipt of a statement in iwriting that he would be unc/ondit-jionally released.      He further pointed out that the  position of- 1 -IMPRISONMENT OF LORD MAYOR OF  CORK.Notes of Meeting held at 10 Downing Street,August 25th, 1920, at 5.30 p.m.
of the prisoner was extremely critical:    that a specialisthad teen called in yesterday who had confirmed the prisondoctor&apos;s diagnosis that what had hitherto been latent had becomeactive tuberculosis.At this point Mr Churchill entered the meeting.      considerable discussion took place with regard to the effect on the country of the apparent climb down of the Government    if he were released,in the course of which it was made clear by Mr Shortt that itwould not be possible to make public what was known of his criminalactivities and that many specious defences might be put up for hisunlawful possession of the key of the Police Code of which he hadbeen convicted.General regret was expressed that no representative of theIrish Executive was available to take part in the discussion.    Itwas finally decided that an urgent telegram (Copy attached) shouldbe sent  to General Macready asking for his  opinion as t o the effect in Ireland of the release of MeSwiney.      It was decided that if general Macready expressed strong views against his release then the Cabinet decision should stand.This Uote was taken by Mr Davidson and not circulatedexcept to Mr Balfour,  and I think Mr Shortt.T.
