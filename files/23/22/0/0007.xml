Q 1O dshould be erected to be decided inconsultation with the Canadian Government.(d) That the stations be planned by a WirelessCommission of about four members, whose functions would probably cease with the completion of the stations, and that the construction of thostations should be entrusted to the EngineeringDepartment of the General Post Office and thecorresponding Dominion and Indian authoritiesaccording to the plans furnished by theCommission.(b) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies andthe Secretary of State for India respectively should approach the Governments of the self-governingDominions and India on the subject of their co-operation in the Schome, and that in addition anattempt should be made to obtain suitablecontributions from any Crown Colonies favourablyaffected.(c) That long-distance wireless communi cat ions withforeign countries should be left to privateenterprise, and that licences, if desired fortho erection of stations for such communications,should bo issued under suitable conditions to commercial Companies.(d) That a special Committee should be appointedto decide the issue of licences, the constitutionof which should be left to Lord kilner, as Chairmanof the Imperial Communications Committee.
