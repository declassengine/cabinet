cLEAGUE OP (1) The Cabinet had &quot;before them the followingNATIONS.papers dealing with the appropriation of funds atEelief Creditsfor Eepatriation       the disposal of the International Committee on of Prisoners ofWar. Relief Credits for the repatriation of prisonersof war:Cspy of a letted from the Secretary-General, League of nations, to the primeMinister.    (CP.1489)Copies of letters cxohanged between sir Erie. Drummond, the Lord presidentof the Council, and the ShippingControllers    (CP. 1619)Copy of a lotted from the Lord presidentof the Council -to the Chancellor of theExchequer.      (CiP.1621)The Cabinet were informed that the subjectof repatriation of the Austrian, Hungarian andether prisoners still in Siberia had engaged theattention of the Supreme Economic Council and of theCouncil of the League of Nations for some monthspast, and, at the request of the Council of theLeague, Pr Nansen had been investigating the problem.As a result, a scheme had been developed for the appropriation of the funds of the international committee on Relief Credits for purposes of repatriation.       It was estimated that, includingshipping, a sum of about  850,000 would be required.All the borrowing nations were agreeable to thediverting of this sum to this purpose from the amount available for reconstruction; but the Eelief Committeehad not felt warranted in diverting the proposed- 1 -
 proposed sum without the specific sanction of the Governments which had provided the funds. In Dr Hanson&apos;s view, the matter was one of great urgency, as, unless relief were forth-coming before tho next winter, there would be an enormous mortality among the prisoners and wide-spread demoralisation among them and their relatives. The Governments of Norway, Holland, Switzerland and Denmark were in favour of granting assistance; Sweden was making grants through the Red Cross Society; France would probably follow the lead given by this country; while there was no liklihood of the United States co-operating. No fresh money from the Treasury was asked for.

 The Cabinet were reminded of the question put in the House of Commons on the 28th June on the subject and the answers then given by the Prime Minister: that, if help were given, it would only be by this country in conjunction with other countries with whom we are associated.

 The Cabinet agreed:

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to authorise Sir John Bradbury to charge the British share of the sum required to the British Relief grant on condition that the other European Powers did their share to find the rest of the sum required. It was to be understood that no charge against the fund was to be admitted for the repatriation of German prisoners.


1^ (2)   Uith reference to Conclusion 1 of a Conference ofSTILEMCHTJLICY. Ministers held, on July 5th,1920, the Cabinet had beforethem a Memorandum by tho Secretary for Scotland on thoposition of Land Settlement in Scotland (G.P. 1617)together with the draft of Instructions to County Councilswhich had been drawn up In accordance with tho Cabinet,dec Is ion *    (C*P. 1562)&quot;.It was argued that Land Settlement in Scotland couldnot be considered solely from the point of view of thedemand for land which has arisen as the result of post-war conditions.     Land Settlement in Scotland has been a contin-uing process from 1886 up to the date of the Uar and theposition had been made much more acute since tho Armistice.time from 1912 up to the present      .y the Board of agriculture for Scotland had only been able to satisfy 1,510 applicants for holdings and enlargEgse&amp;ts.     Of these only 280 wereex-service mcn*     Today the Board have upon their booksDuplications  Tom 6,457 civilians and 4*576 ex-service mon*Of this number only 2,000 can be settled from existing funds *This would leave nearly 9,000 of the present applicantsunsatisfied.     Groat expectations had been created by theLand Settlement Act; and to close down operations under itless than a year after its passing Into law would, particul-arly in view of tho figures stated, create an into lerablesituation       The men were beooD&apos; ming&apos; increasingly impatientat the delay and had begun to raid some of the farms-     Ifthe poi&amp;ey of settlement were now arrested, social orderwcuH be gravely menaced and the po&amp;itlon in many parts ofScotland would become not unlike that of Ireland -     It was maintained that the pledges given before the election wereunambigtious, and, if the policy proposed were adopted, thesepledges would bo manifestly brokeno     The position in England,
while not so acute, was yet very unsatisfactory from thepoint of view of the ex-servico men, and if the decision ofthe Cabinet to assign a proportion of the existing ftuids to each County Council were announced, the Coimty Councilswould demand to know whether any more .moncy would *bo avail-able for the unsatisfied applicants*Tho Cabinet wore roninded       the election pledgeswhich had been given and were impressed with the&apos; social andpolitical discontent which would be aroused by any suddenor substantial decline in the working of the Land Settlementpolicya     On the other hand, fully to meet the demands of present and prospective applicants&quot; at the current cost ofland and equipmentmight involve the Treasury in an addition-al expenditure for the United Kingdom of.  100,000,000.    It,&apos;was impossible to contemplate such an expenditure in thopresent state of the country&apos;s ginanees and it was thereforefelt to bo Imperative to overhaul the policy and machineryof settlement with a view to the most rigorous economies.It was statedj. for example,, that in England it was estimated-that 4 yjo of the expenditure on each holding was irrecoverablewhereas in Scotlattfl the figure was as high as from 60$ to* 70;&apos;;.The Cabinet agrood:-(a) ^hat the Prime Minister in    consultation with theLord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the exchequer should appoint a Committee to oyorhaul the present policy and machinery of Land Settlement.(b) That the Committee&quot;should consider how far it was reasonably possible to meet the demands of thonumerous applicants, for&apos; small holdings, and what -additional financial assistance, if any, should be rendered by the Government and what, economics;could bo enforced in tho methods of purchase.orrenting of land, in the;size of holdings, and the&apos;provision of equipment. .   (Reference, should.bo.made to the recommendations of Lord Gavels :       .&apos; -Committee. G. 225 and&quot;&quot;G.T. 63,73),..,
RAILWAY POLICY - Increase of Passenger Fares.

(3) The Cabinet were asked as a matter of urgency to consider the desirability of increasing the passenger fares on the railways in order to give effect to the Government policy of avoiding a subsidy. It was explained that the railway deficit on the year was estimated at £54,000,000, and, in order to remove this in 8 months, it would be necessary to levy £74,000.000 on goods and passenger traffic. The Minister of Transport had conferred with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Exchequer who were agreed that the deficit ought to be spread over a few months of the next financial year. The question of revising passenger rates was now before the Rates Advisory Committee and their Report would not be received at a date which would permit an increase of fares earlier than August 1st. But to raise the fares on the eve of the Bank Holiday would arouse great popular opposition: while, to delay even for a week, would involve a loss of about £1,000,000. A questions was down in the House that afternoon on the subject.

The Cabinet authorised the Minister of Transport to reply as follows:

"I would refer the Honourable Member to Cmd. paper 815 and to the replies given to a similar question by the Honourable member for South Molton on the 12th July. The Government is most desirous of causing as little inconvenience as possible consistently with the principle that the railways must be put upon what is estimated to be a self-supporting basis. It is not proposed to increase the charge for ordinary tickets before the 5th August, which will meet the case of the Bank Holiday traffic.
bv/AIiCBS (4)    Pith reference to Conclusion 5 of a Conference of3IKCLBUhifCBCOIEG      hinisters held on July 5th IS20, the Cabinet hadITylKG who I)ihlffiK.&apos;l:T      &quot;belore them a Loraorandum by the minister oi labourISTIV23.(0.1,1508), and a heaorandum by the   Jiancollcr ofthe Ii;chenuer (C.x * 1508 -J , deilinp with ,. proposalto grant to a single man in training an allowance fora widowed mother dependent u on Mia and living athis home of 10/- nor week.     It was argot&quot; that thiswas a ease oi&quot; very special hardship and that it was difficult to justify its refusal in viow of the grantof 17/6 at present made to a single man with dependentrelatives living away from home.      &quot;n the other hand,it was pointed out that once the concession was aadoto vaen in training it would be aiffi cult to refuse itto men un&amp;erscoina treatment.The Cabinet were agreed that the proposal should &quot;bo rejected.
If A DEEE1TCE (5) The Cabinet were informed that the Council3CE BILL.of the Government of India were considering thequestion of compulsory military service for whitemen in India, and the Secretary of State for Indiadesired the guidance of the Cabinet as to the attitude to be taken on the subject in the event of a private member moving in favour of compulsory service.The Cabinet were agreed that the official members of the igouncil should be free to vote as they wished on the subject; and that,if it ?/ere found that the Government of Indiaand the unofficial representatives were infavour of compulsory military service forEuropeans, the Secretary of State shouldapprove if the &quot;Viceroy should think fit.

ggTTLEIflSITT   1&quot;     With reference&apos; to Cabinet 37(20), Conclusion 7,^ the Conference had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture (C*P.1562), covering draftParagraphs intended to serve as the basis cf a Circular1to be issued to Local Authorities for guidance In ad-ministering the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act.     these paragraphs Incorporated the provisional decisions reached at cabinet 37(20) and provided, inter alia,  (1) thatnames of new applicants should be entered on a separatelist, such applicants being informed that they cannot bedealt with under the present scheme, or until the needsof the approved applicants have been met.    (2) That owingto building difficulties the authorities should concen-trate on the acquisition of such land as will require aminimum expenditure upon buildings, or can be letwithout equipment.    (3) That to the utmost extent possible,land should be leased or should be purchased by meansof County annuities under the facilities contained inthe Act of 1919, and that Care should *bej italic to &apos;*seethat the applicants are not provided with unnecessarilylarge holdingss and that special preference Is givento men who served overseas during the war as againstmen who only served at home.It was pointed out that the publication of a circular on these lines would create grave dissatia-faction throughout the country, and would provokecharges of breach of faith.In the absence of the Secretary for Scotland, sir robert Greig stated that the position in Scotland wasvery similar to that In England, though the difficultyof providing bullding3 was not so acute. Theff-
The feeling in Scotland had already led to land beingraided, and the Secretary for Scotland was in favourof the question of policy being re-opened,    Ont  theother hand it was pointed out that the provision ofadditional money to meet all claims in Scotland v,*ouldinvolve an increase of 10 millions for that countryand possibly an increase of 66 millions for England,and that it was quite clear that Scotland and Englandmust be treated exactly alike,,Ultimately the Conference decided:-To re-affirm the decision on the questionof policy reached at Cabinet 37  (20)  and to request the Departments concerned to;agree the terms of a draft circular tobe issued simultaneously to Local AuthoritiesIn the United kingdom, this draft circular to be submitted to the Cabinet by theMinister of Agriculture as soon as possible after the return from Scotland of Mr*Munr o c2*     The Conference had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and the Ministerof Labour (CeP*1464) recommending that In view of theincrease in the cost of living since the rates ofpensions and allowances were fixed in September, 1919,weekly bonuses should be granted of **(a) 5/- a week In the cdse of disabled ,mendrawing total disablement pension, orIn receipt of allowances In respect of either medical treatment or training,at the minimum pension rateI(b) 2/6 a vireek to all widows over 40 or havingchildren under their care:(c) 2/6 a week to all dependents In receiptof a pension based on need.The rates of bonuses to be payable for seven months from the 1st September, 1920 at an estimated cost of 2,250,000.    Also a Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. 14640,)covering a Treasury letter dated22nd June 1920 setting forth the Treasury objections
to the grant of any temporary &quot;bonuses to T-ar pensioners,end criticising the basis of the amounts of bonusproposed.The attention of the Conference was also directed to the answer given by Tir. Bonar Law on the Icth june to a Question in the House of Commons by Mr.. CharlesThite (CP. 1464..B.).On behalf bf the proposals it was stated that- sincethe agreement of September 1919 ,7&amp;s reached,, the cost- ofliving figures shewed an in cr en we of 30 per cent..   Thetotally disabled men felt very strongly that they oughtto be accorded similar treatment to the ordinary employees in industry whose wages were subject to adjustment whenever the cost of living index figures materially altered.These men, unlike the partially disabled men,  got no benefit from the increase in wages.      It was also pointedout that  since the scale was fixed men outside industry had received advances ranging from 8/- to 16/- a week to 25%) which compared favourably with the 12-^increase no1? proposed for the pensioners.On the other hand it was pointed out that thedecision to fix the rates for three years was taken bythe House of Commons in the supposed interests of the pensioners, that it was extremely improbable thata concession onoe made could bo confined to the totallydisabled men and that if the settlement was once ,re-opened in favour of the latter,  on the&quot; ground ofthe increased cost of living,- it would be impossiblelogically to refuse similar concessions to all pensioners.Moreover, it would be particularly difficult to withholda concession to the partially disabled man out Ofemployment since his position Would be then pr act i sally
iaent-ijcad writh that &quot;of &quot;the- totally&quot; ol-saJxLecr maru-   It.was also pointed out that the settlement in question-gave the pensioners increases at a cost of  22,000,000per annum and in the result placed then in   a far better position than war pensioners in Prance or any other country.In connection with the suggestion that it was-improbable that pri:^es would fall before next spring,it wad pointed out- that the wholesale prices showed a tendency to fall and that freight-rates vrcre falling.At the same time it was felt that the question ofthe abolition of the Bread Subsidy which,  if decided upon, would mean a substantial rise in the cost ofliving index number had an.important bearing on thepre sent quest ion.It. was ultimately decided-:-To postpone further consideration of the- question of a bonus on pensions until adecision had been reached on the questionof the  continuance of the Bread Subsidy.jOWANCBSPOR   3-      ^be Conference had under consideration (l) AJG-LE MEN UNDER-WG TRAINING   Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP. 5;/08)  ashing) HAVEpHBENT as from the 1st July,  1920 that a single man in trainingSAT I -TBS.living at home,  and with a widowed mother dependentupon hin, should be granted an allowance of 10/- aweek, at an estimated cost of  240,000 per annum, and(2) A Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. 1508.A.). covering a Treasury letter dated 22nd June, 1920,particularising-the Treasury objections to the proposals.In the unavoidable absence of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer the Conference decided:-To defer consideration of this question to a future meeting when the Chancellorcould be present.
(&apos;&amp;)       With reference to the 54th Minutes of theHome Affairs Committee, Conclusion 5, theConference had under consideration a memorandumby the Minister of Health (CP.1543) on theaction t-gken by certain local authorities tocompal those employed by them to&apos; join tradeunions.    It was - explained in the memorandum that- certain Borough Councils were steadily pur-suing a policy of coercion in regard to non-unionists and that in one instability ce the followingresolution had been issued as a poster- -&quot;&quot;That all employees of this Council be membersof their respective trade unions&quot;.    It was ex-plained to the Conference that the Ministry ofHealth had caused the matter to be examined care-fully, and it was clear that they had. no legal powers to prevent such action being taken, althoughit was felt that an intolerable position was beingcreated in some places for persons who had beenmany years in the employment of local authorities,and at the risk of losing their places, were beingbullied&apos; into taking a course of which they did not approve. --It was suggested that, the law officers should be asked to explore the question and toadvise whet legislation could be framed to preventundue pressure being exercised on those employedby local authorities.    On the other hand, It waspointed out.that.the: trade unions were, at themoment, very sensitive to criticism of any kind,,and that it would be a bad time to raise contro-versy on such a question.After some discussion the Conferenae agreed,
without coming to any decision as to thegeneral question of policy to request the Committee of Home affairs with the assistance of the Law -officers to examirs the matter from every pointof view and to report thereon to theCabinet .(5)    V/ith reference to Conclusion 3 of aConference of Ministers of December 9th,  1919,the Meeting had under consideration a memoran-dum by the Secretary of State for War (CP.1344).with reference to the way in which the BelgianGovernment proposed to deal with the ruins of ypres .   .It appeared that opinion in Belgium was divided^ and that while it had been decided bythe Belgian Government to preserve the ruinsof the Olctix   Hall and the Cathedral as. a mem-oriai of the War the Burgomaster of Ypreshad succeeded in changing the decision in orderto meet his proposal for rebuilding the townincluding the houses fronting on the Clo*h   Halland the Cathedral.    In consequence of this de^-cision, It would shortly become necessary toremove the ruins.    It vas     *hcl&apos;d&apos;      that theruins of Ypres stood to the British nation assymbols of the Great War and of the sacrificewhich the British Army had made in the field of Flanders, and that a protest should be madeto the Belgian-Government against the proposalto remove them.    It was suggested to the Meeting,however, that it would be most improper to dictateto the Government of a foreign country on a matter which they might justifiably hold was one in which
