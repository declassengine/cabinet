jnterimfpVTSION)? railway rates,TOLLS\nd&apos; CHARGES(1) The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (Paper CP.-1741)  covering a further Report of the Rates Advisory Committee dealingwith the interim revision of charges for merchandise etc.traffic by freight and passenger train.The Cabinet were reminded that,  so far as GreatBritain is concerned,  the  amount to be raised before duly 31,199,1, is estimated at  66,000,000, that the estimated yield from the Increase in passenger fares is  17,000,000, leaving 49,000,000 to be raised from merchandise by freight and passenger train, and that to provide this aura in elevenmonths the increase must be such as to produce in a full year 53,500,000.    It is not possible to 3oread the deficiencyover a longer period without prolonging the parried of theGovernment guarantee,  but it is a fundamental condition ofthe scheme that the rates proposed will be subject to reviewbefore the railways are handed back to the Companies, andthis will ensure that the Companies receive no special wind-fall at the expense of the trader.The Minister of Transport pointed out that the addi-national  sum   to be  raised to wipe out the deficit was estimatedonly;    that no margin whatever was left fc contingencies,and on July 31 next a deficit might even exist.    Any reduc-tion from the.recommendations of the Committee might, andprobably would,  cause a corresponding deficit.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the adoption of the proposalsaet out in the Memorandum by the Ministerof Transport respecting the interim revisionof charges for merchandise etc.  traffic byfreight and passenger train in the case ofBritish and Irish railways respectively,with effect as  from September 1, 1930.

Cabinet agreed -To approve the.recomroondations of theBates Advisory&apos; Committee respectingworkmen&apos;is fa-res,  subject to the livnit-ation that no fare should be increasedby rao-e than 300 per cent.,  or 3/- aweek.
aocurate .(For copies of telegrams which have passed between the British Embassy, Paris, andthe Foreign Office on this matter,  seeAjojaendj^JL-)(3) The Cabinet were informed-that-a...statement had appeared in the everting&quot;-newspapers to the effect that thetl^t^h^o^^mr^nt..had^decided to recognise the Governmentof General wrangel as a de facto Government, to send a diplomatic Agent to Sevastopol with the title of HighCommissioner,  and. to render General ?/r-angel all materialassistane e,It was pointed out that no communication of any kind had been received on the subject from the FrenchGover*ntnent, and that no mention of the recognition oflene-raj; &quot;Wr-angel. had been made by the French at the LympneConferenceo   The .Pr^rchr*Bmb-aesy&quot;- in.-London had received nonotification of the decision of the French Government.It was agreedThat,  in reply to Sir Donald Maclean,who was about to raise the question-in the House of Commons, the PrimeMinister should state that he had read the announcement in the paperswith great surprise, that no informa-tion &quot;(official or- otherwise) had been communicated&apos;to him or to the ForeignOffice, and that he could not believethat the statement was an accurate one.At a later stage of the meeting a telephone message, received at the Foreign Office from the british embassy in Paris, was communicated to the Cabinet, to theeffect that the reports in the press were substantially
A RMS AT C-Oil- (4)  Reference was made to the rifles stored at Constan-STANTINOPLB.tinople, which, in the event of a rupture with the SovietGovernment, it wag agreed at Lyrapne to hand over to theFrench for transmission to General Grange1.    It was pointedout that while,  in view of the continued advance of theSoviet troops, Great Britain was at liberty to supply arms to the Poles so far as the Soviet Government was concerned,andthat that Government could bring no charge of breach of faitha?.ainRt u3, the assurances given to the House of Commons bythe Prime Minister rendered it most undesirable to allow thearin3 to be moved.The Cabinet agreed  (&amp;) That instructions  should be sent by telegram to the General Commanding in constantinople, by the Secretary ofState for &quot;rar, to the effect that no action regarding the removal of therifles or handing them over to theFrench must be taken without further orders:(b) That the French Government  and Admiralde Robeck should be informed officiallyby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs that these instructions had beensent to the British Military authorities at Constantinople.BRITISH TROOPS       (5) Trie Cabinet were informed that it was most import-AT ALIENSTEIN.ant  to withdraw the British. Battalion from Allenstein beforethe railways were closed.    The French and Italian governments had been pressed to concur in such withdrawal, and in orderto meet the views of those Governments it had been agreedto defer the completion of the evacuation of the Battalionuntil August 15th.As the completion of the evacuation could not in anycase be accomplished until August 15th., the Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for war should issue telegraphic instructionsat once, ordering the withdrawal ofthe Battalion.
-luBSIDT^ (6) &quot;/ith ********* *o Cabinet 43 (20), Conclusion 5,the Cabinet had under c-ons-ider*ation a Memorandum by theP-ood Controller- (paper CP.-1746) explaining the difficul-ties in the way of ca-rying out the policy of gradual reduction of the Bread Subsidy and at the same time&quot; keepingthat policy secret.The Cabinet were informed that it would be impossibleto reduce the subsidy by instalments without the fact become-ing known In a few weeks&apos; time.    Moreover, the administrative difficulties of carrying out the Cabinet decision, and theexpense in connection with, the setting up of the accountingisachjjr\ery required, were very considerable.    It was desirablethat a frank statement should be published of the Govern-ment intentions to abolish the subsidy, and the question was whether the whole subsidjr should be abolished in Septem-ber, which would mean increasing the cost of the loaf toISoSdo or probably lscSd*,  or whether abolition should be accomplished in two steps (3d. in September, 1920, and Sd.in March, 1921), which latter alternative would mean that-the Bread Subsidy for the present financial year would cost ...approximately  38-,OOO, 000. &apos;        ?    .On the one hand, it was felt that to abolish- t-he&apos;,,% .;.&apos;subsidy in one step would result in very serious- disniont^nt^and unrest.    The industrial outlook was not promising,&apos;, arid-everythirv.^ possible 1 e.should&quot; be- done--1o minimise the caus&amp;s..&apos;-&apos;. ^&apos; -- -of trouble before the winter.    On the other hand, it- was^ ,pointed out that, as the subsidy must in any case end. by) f^.March 3lat next, it was better to get the trouble overt -at&apos;once rather than allow it to simmer throughout the winter..;:.^Moreover, the proposal to defer the total abolition of thesubsidy until next Spring Involved very heavy charges on theExchequer.It was generally agreed that any attempt to reopen the -question or to continue tne subsidy after March-31st-next-5-
shjcatLd&apos; be . iirroly --r*c-si and on this understanding theCabinet, agreed  &apos;H (a) To iaodify the prsvious deeision and torequire the abolition of the bread subsidy by two st eps, of 3d. in Septem-ber,   1920:,  and the residue by March 31,1921:(b) That this decision should be eorrauni-oate d forthwith to the House of commons by the  Chancellor of the  Exoheqixen, who should ;iiahe it clear that the liabilitywould definitely come to an end at the close of the present  financial year.(?) the attention of the Cabinet was directed to communications from Warsaw and Moscow respectively, indicating that,  the Polish and Soviet Armistice Delegates had failedto meet, frora which it appeared possible that this failurehad been intentionally effected by the Russian authorities the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should cause a communication to be  sent  to M. Kameneffgiving the substance of the Polishtelegram, and. urging that immediatefacilities for the meeting of the delegates should be given.(A, copy . of. jipj^pli^nnicati ohseret^i^&quot; lU.Z&apos;:\&quot;h?neff is.attached&quot;: &quot;&quot;p^e a^ne nd ix.,ix.)POLISH AMDRUSSIANARMISTICEDELEGATIONS&apos;.
10 GN.      (8) With reference to Conclusion 4 of a Conference ofMinisters held on July 36,  1920, the Cabinet were informedthat, al+housh between 900 and 1-,-OCO men had been dismissedby the Irish Railways for refusing to carry troops and munitions, dismissals were now being conducted in a half-hearted manner,  and there was no doubt that the  officials and the men were being subjected to intimidation.    TheIrish Railways,  other than the Ulster Railways, were refus-Ing to obey orders, and the  Railway Managers Committee had recommended that the Government should now close down, lineby line, tbt- railways which refused to carry troops or government  stores.    It was explained, however, that if thiscourse were adopted, the Government would still be under a liability to make up the net receipts under the guarantee,and. it was thought preferable to issue an order to therailways to give Government traffic absolute priority.In the event of the railways failing to carry out thisorder9 the Government could then withhold money payable under the guarantee, and could also suspend for the timebeing the coming into operation of the- inc-reaeed&apos;&quot;&quot;pas-aenger......and goods rates. In this way pressure could, be put on theline s * which would either have to close down or comply withthe Government instructions.It was generally agreed that,  provided there was no serious legal objection,  steps should be taken to carry-out,..this latter policy in the case of all Irish lines whichrefused to carry out thsir statutory duties as commoncarriers.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That, provided the Irish Law Officers saw no objection, steps should now be taken to order the Irish Railways to give absolute priority to Government traffic, and that failure to give such priority should entail the loss of&quot;money payable under the guarantee:(b)That the Minister of Transport should be at&quot;liberty to withhold from any Irish Railwaythe benefits of the revised rates of railway charges *
(S)    With reference to Sabinot 12 (19) Conclusion 3,tho Cabinet wore informed that, having regard to hiastate of health, it vie uld not be possible for the prince of Wales to open the Indian Legislatures as had boonproposed, and that in thodo ciroumstancos it had beensuggested that tho Duke of Connaught should undertaketho Mission In question.The Prime Minister,undertook,  en behalf of theCabinet, to suggest that If tho proposal met with His Majesty&apos;s approval, tho Puke ofConnaught should be approach3d with a view tcascertaining whether his Royal Eighnoss wouldundo rtakc the Mission.2 , Whi tohall Card ens ,   3 .v;.,August 11th 1920.PROPOSEDOPENINGOF INDIANLEGISLATURESBY THEPP.LNSE OFviabes.

Amost simultaneously Prime Minister, who wasinterrogated in House of Commons, expressed his conviction that report must bo unfounded, since&quot;.no Intimation had beenmade to us by Breach Government,  and the step taken by-latter appeared to be entirely inconsistent with Lymphsdecision that measures, of which support to .rangel wasone,  should, not be undertaken until it was clear thatPolish negotiations had broken down.inly after Prime Minister had spoken, did we learn from you that report was correct,      Even yet we entertain thehope that some mistake has been made and in view of what happened at Lympno that the announcement has been made without the authority of the French Government.

APPENDIX    II

11th August, 1920.

Mr Lloyd George presents his compliments to Mr. Ka? and bogs to acknowledge receipt of his letter of August llth covering a communication from Moscow stating that the representatives of the Russian Command had waited for the Polish armistice delegates since the evening of August 9th, but that the Polish delegation had not yet arrived.

Mr Lloyd George begs to inform Mr. Kameneff that he has just received message from the Polish Government at Warsaw dated August 10th (9 p.m.) in which it is stated that the Polish Government had, up till that time, received no answer from the Soviet Government agreeing to the proposal of the Polish Government, contained in their radio addressed to the Soviet Government on August 5th, and finally accepted by the latter after three vain attempts of transmission, in which radio the Polish Government expressed their readiness to send delegates to negotiate an armistice and preliminaries of peace at Minsk.

The only intimation which had reached Warsaw to the effect that the Polish delegates were expected to arrive in Minsk on August llth was a prose telegram of the Haves agency from Hythe received in Warsaw on August 10th.

Mr Lloyd George wishes further to state that the representatives of the British Government in Warsaw have also reported that the Polish Government have repeatedly endeavoured to get into touch with Moscow by wireless, both direct and via Norway, and that the message had always been refused. They further inform ? what the Polish officer in command on the section of the front beyond ? had just announced that a Russian peace delegation had just arrived on that part and had stated, on not finding the Polish delegates,that they would ? until 10 o&apos;clock this morning (August llth). The Polish Government are replying that a Polish delegation are proceeding to the front at once to meet them, and that,if the Russian delegates are still there, they will send their peace delegation at once to meet them. They further state that they are notifying the Soviet Government that they are prepared to send off their armistice and peace delegation tonight (Angust llth).

Mr Lloyd George trusts that Mr. Kameneff will see that immediate instructions are issued for the reception and passage through the lines to Minsk of the Polish peace and armistice delegation, and that the Russian wireless stations are instructed to receive and transmit Polish mess ages without delay. He cannot help stating that this constant refusal to receive messages from Warsaw, while the Soviet army is steadily advancing, cannot fail to arouse justifiable suspicion and is not conducive to a prompt and peaceful solution of the present crisis.
