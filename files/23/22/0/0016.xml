t5,1 AN TRADE        (1)  With reference to Cabinet 53 (20). Conclusion 2BGATICN. *the Prime Minister drew the attention of the Cabinet    aa a^po^sed Trans-jti&quot;n in       matter of urgency, to a letter he had received fro:: Messrslatinum.Bull &amp; Bull, who had recently resigned from the position of legal advisers to the Russian Trade Delegation.    Messrs Bull&amp; Pull had received a letter from one of their clients, namelylaessre Donald Campbell &amp; Co., a firm of merchants, asking the-:  to advise them ao to a request received from the russian trade Delegation that they should receive 50 lbs. weight ofplatinum.    In particular, Messrs Donald Campbell &amp; Co. had asked that the following questions might be put to theGovernment(i) In there any objection to their receivingthis platinum and placing it in their Bank?(ii) Have the Government any objection to theirselling the platinum?(ill) Have the Government any objection to theirpaying ever the proceeds to the russian trade Delegation?Attention was called to the risk of the Governmentaccepting any responsibility in respect of the platinumunless it was known from where it originated?    whether itwas identifiable;    and whether at any time it had becomesecurity for any specific commercial transaction.The Cabinet agreed  That the Primo Minister should n. ply toMessrs Bull &amp; Bull in the sense that therewas no objection to Messrs Donald Campbell&amp; Go. receiving the platinuc; and placing itin their Bank, but that until a final reply had been received to Lord Cursor.&apos;s latestcommunication to M. Tchitoherin the Govern-c:ent did not wish this platinum to be soldnor the proceeds to be handed over to theRussian Trade Delegation,JtAN TRADE (2) Arising cut of the discussion summarised in thepTIATIQNS.preceding Conclusion,  tho Cabinet agreed -That the question of the resumption, orotherwise of the Russian Trade negotia-tionB, on which subject several reportswero before the Cabinet, should be post-pcned until the receipt of the reply ofthe Russian Soviet Government to Lord0urzon&apos;s Note,,
(3) The Cabinet had -.ndor auiiaido-ifitijsti u fafj^rtuvA-ain bythe Chancellor of the Exchequei   (Paper 0.P.-1930)  relative to a resolution to be moved by the representative of theShip Constructors and Shipwrights Association on the Ship-building &quot;h-ade Joint Council,  tc the effect that any penaltyimposed by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury upon any Government em-ployee exercising the right to strike is contrary to thespirit and meaning of the Trades Pisputes Act.The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that theofficial side of the Trade Joint Council should be instruct-ed to make an announcement on behalf of the Government inthe following termst-&quot;Tt is true that there is no statutory prohibitionof Strikes by Civil Servants.    Such a prohibitionhas not hitherto been found necessary,- for CivilServants have recognised that the fact that theyare servants of the State and the conditions ofheir establishment with pension on retirementmpose special obligations upon them and differ-:ehtiate their case from that of the employees ofany private trader for profit.But the principle upon which Parliament has pro-ceedv.d in giving legal sanction to the award ofpensions to Civil Servants is  that they shouldhave rendered faithful and satisfactory serviceand this primary condition cannot be held to havebeen satisfied in the case of Servants of the Statewho by striking have endangered or prevented the carrying on of the Public Service for which Govern-rent is responsible to Parliament and the community&quot;.It was suggested that the meeting of the ShipbuildingTrade Joint. Council was not a sufficiently important occasion for the promulgation of the Governmentla policy, that itwould be better not to raise this particular issue at-thepresent ti,&amp;,  and that the&apos; best courss would be to instruct the official representatives on the Council to move thePrevious Question and to state that the particular issue was outside the competence of the Council.In this connection it was pointed o\it that theresolution proposed by the Association could not be carriedunless a majority of the aembers of both sides of theCouncil was in favour of it,-2**&quot;
The Cabinet agreed -(a) That it was desirable that the Governmentshould state ita position on this parti-cular issue at the earliest possible moment:(b) That the Treasury should instruct theofficial side of the Shipbuilding TradeJoint Council to make a statement in theterms given above, the last paragraphof which differs from the concludingparagraphs given in the statement in paper CP.-1930.(4) With reference to Cabinet 4G (20), Conclusion 2,  theCabinet had. under consideration the Interim Report of theUnemployment Committee (Paper CP.-1907).    This Report,  afterindicating the extent of the problem and the probable in-crease of unemployment in the near futxire, points out that,the least objectionable fore of State subsidised employment is the building of houses, which, givon good will on the partof the operatives in the huilding trade, might enable employ-cent tc be given to 100,000 unemployed ex-Service- men.    TheReport then, suggested that relief could be given to a sub-etantial extent by expediting the execution cf the Ministryof Transport&apos;s road programme, and recommended that theluinistry be authorised to expend  4,500,000 on the construc-participator. or arterial reads in Greater London, and that an Bxecu-tive Committee should bf? set up to consider how far schemesfor the provision of roads in the Provinces could be expedit-wed by the use cf unemployed labour,  a sum of  2,500,000 being placed at the disposal of the Committe- for making grants in aid to Local Authorities.Th&apos;: Cabinet were informed that the Unemployment Com-committee had not been able to reach agreement on the rate ofwages to be paid for road work^ and that the further recom-mendation that the funds should be provided out of the RoadImprovement Fund was opposed by the Minister of Transport,on the ground that pledgee had been given, in Parliament andovteid% that this Fund should,, in the main, be utilised for
the improvement of existing roads and not for the construc-tion of new roads.Some discussion took place or. the nature of the pledges which had been given,  and it was pointed out thatthf Departmental Committee on the Taxation ana Regulationof Road Vehicles had reeoEjmended that the proceeds of thekoto? Tap should be devoted to the maintenance, improvement and construction of roads and tridges,  and also that whenthe Treasury had agreed to waive any claim to the proceeds of the ^ax this had been done on the express condition thatno further claim would be made or. the Exchequer for money for roads.On. the other hand it was urged,  on behalf of theMinistry of Transport,  that the pledges given could not nowbe recalled,  and that the Local Authorities had made their arrangements on the strength of the grants in aid whichhad been promised ther .....   After some further discussion it was agreed - To defer further consideration of thequestion of utilising the Read Improve-ment Fund moneys and of setting up theLxccutivr- Committee until tho Ihinxsborof Transport could be present to asked-tehis objections to the Committee&apos;s pro-pos als.Ths Cabinet then proceeded to consider the questionof the wage to be paid to ex-Service men on road work.It was pointed out that there were severe! possible alternatives.    For example, the wage should be a living wage,and yet one that would not attract men froni other employment.It -of a a suggested that an amount equivalent to 90 per cent, ofthe agricultural wage would satisfy these - conditions.On the other hand, it was pointed out that a largenumber of men would have to be employed in the neighbourhoodof towns, and that public opinion vould not tolerate thepayment of a wage to the ex-Service : an substantially belowt-h* f9.s* *nrn*d by civilian roadmakers, which varied from
2 G175/- to 100/- a week.    It was admitted that this rate wouldhe very much in excess of the rates proposed to be paid to ex-Service men engaged on Housing work, but this distinctioncould be defended on the ground that  the latter were loarn-inn p. skilled trade, whereas the roadmaker * a must alwaysremain an unskilled occupation.    In this connection, howeverit was pointed out that the effect of paying a relatively high wage to the rcadroaker would trnd to draw off men on housing to road-making.In suppox t of the proposal that the rage shouldapproximate to the agricultural wage, the Cabinet were reminded that the works were relief works, and that any verylarge increase in the number of ex-Service unemployed wouldmake it roost difficult for the Government to find the money for their wages.It was urged that the objections to paying theagricultural rate, and also the objections to paying thefull marhot rate, might be met by basing the wage on thelocal rate for unskilled labour on road work in the parti-cular district,  and riving 75 per cent,  cf that rate for a preliminary period of two or three months while oho man waslearning his job.    The objection to this course was that it*only be more difficult to bring the relief works to an endif, after a few months,  the men were receiving the Pollmarket wage, and that in any case it was indefensible to payable higher wage for relief -ork than that paid fox reallyproductive -oxk..After some further discussion, in the course of whichthe opinion was exprf sard that no useful purpose wou;d boserved by endeavouring to negotiate a wages agreement withthe men&apos;s Unions, it was agreed  labour on road -\rork in the locality con-cerned, and that each employee should be subjected to a probationary period o* four months, duxing which time he should beentitled to. receive only 75 per cent, ofthe standard wage.

(5) With reference to Cabinet 40 (20), Conclusion 2,  the Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by Sir L. Worthington Evans (Paper C.P.-1915) covering the Report of the Land Settlement committee and also a Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture (Paper C.p.-1931). 

The Cabinet were informed that no objections had been received to the Committee&apos;s re recommendations, and that the Treasury were prepared to accept the recommendations.

The Cabinet agreed--

To approve the recommendations contained in the Committee&apos;s Interim Report, a summary of which, is attached here to (See Appendix).

(6) With references to Cabinet 52 (20), Conclusion 5, the Cabinet were informed that negotiations had taken place between the Ministry of Health and the employers and employees in the Building Trades respecting the question of a guaranteed week. Differences had arisen, and a compromise by the Ministry of Health had been submitted to both sides.

It was urged that it could be impolitic to precipitate a crises on this particular issue, and after some discussion the Cabinet agreed --

That the dispute with the employees in

the Building Trade could beat take place

on a claim, by the Government to ?

houses, utilising for the ? the

labour of the large numbers of t?

and untrained ex-Service men now of employment.

(7) The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary (Paper C.P.-1906) covering instructions which had been drafted by the Minister of Labour, for Sir M. Delevingne, as the British member of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office.

Consideration of this question was postponed until Thursday, October 14th.
iKEY. (8)  With reference to Cabinet 53 (20), Appendix II,pospd the Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet, as a matter ofp. acelnat   -urgency, that he had received a very important telegram,taphasi. dated October 5, 1920,  from M. Venizelos,  stating that for financial and economic reasons he had to take decisions inregard to the demobilisation of the Greek forces in the smyrna region.    p. Venizeloa, in his telegram, had set forthhis apprehensions in regard to the menacing position inAnatolia if Mustapha Kemal was not dealt with.    He had sug-gested that the only radical remedy was a new campaign withthe object of destroying definitely the nationalist forcesaround Angora and the Pontus.    Such a campaign would result(1) in driving the Turks out of Constantinople, which would form-.,  together with the zone of the Straits, a separate State?an^  (3) In the constitution of a separate State in Pontus,where the population would be mainly Greek, composed partly of. the Greeks who have remained there,, aid partly of thosewho have emigrated from time to time to escape Turkish perse-cut ion and are now dispersed in South Russia to a total of800,000.    He pointed out that this State,  collaborating withArmenia and Georgia, would form a solid barrier againstIs1amian, and,  eventually,  against Russian Imperialism.    TheGreek forces would be sufficient to ensure the success of the expedition, but for political and financial reasons theHellenic Government would be unable to assume the exclusiveinitiative and responsibility thereof.    He suggested that the greeks would b^ ready to collaborate if Great Britain wouldtake the initiative and give the necessary financial assist-ance.    Owing to the approach of winter, he asked for an imme-diate decision.    If demobilisation had once occurred,  greece would be unwilling to undertake a fresh mobilisation withina few months.The Prime Minister asked that the utmost secrecyshould be observed in this matter, as,, if any action shouldbe deemed advisable, it was most important that Mustapha
Kernel should not he forewarned.THE CHIEF OF THE IMFrJPXAl GE33RAL STAFF statedthat a copy of this telegram had been communicated tohim by Sir John Stsvridi.M. Veniaelos had shown himself so good a judge ofwhet the Greek forces could accomplish that he was inclin-ed to think it probable that the Greek forces could reachAngora.     Before advising the Cabinet, however, on themilitary aspect of this question, he had felt it necessaryto obtain further information as tc the number of divisionit was proposed to employ and how long they could remainin the field if Mustapha  era&amp;lhs forces retired in front of them;    as to what exactly was meant by Fontua;    andas to the cost of the expedition,,There was a short preliminary discussion on thepolitical aspect of the question, in the course of whichIt was pointed out that M. YeniEelos&apos;s proposals amountedto tearing up the Turkish Treaty;    that the proposedState of Porrtus would be virtually a Greek State;    thatConstantinople would be almost hemmed in by Greek terri-tory;    and that the proposal was not likely to be at allacceptable to the French and Italian Governments-It was agreed(a) To reserve the further consideration ofthe question until the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had received the informationhe had asked for ;(b) That the Chief ox the Imperial General Staff,on receipt of the required information,  should send s report direct to the prime Minister.
ilpSillf&quot; (?) Wlth reference-*e ^Cabinet 16 (20)., Conclusion ?,9 PALESTINE, the Cabinet had before the a. the following documents inregard to mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine:-Drafts of Mandates circulated by theSecretary of Stats  for Foreign Affairs(Paper CP.-1896):A Note by the secretary of State forIndia asking for a postponement of thedecision on the Mandate   until reports are received fror Sir Percy Cox, theHigh. Commissioner of Mesopotamia.In the course of the discussion stress was laid onthe importance of ensuring that corresponding conditions tothose under consideration were inserted in the French mandate for Syria.    It was pointed out,  for example,  that under this draft the possibility wculd be excluded of our utilisingforces raised in Mesopotamia 6i Palestine as Indian and African troops were used in the late Par, or for the defenceof India.The Cabinet wore informed that it was desired to cometo an understanding with the French before the question came before the Assembly of the League of Nations.    As soon asthe Cabinet had approved the Mandates they would be comparedwith the French draft, with a view to reaching uniformitywith the Mandate for Syria on as many articles as possible.The Cabinet agreed - (a) That the Secretary of State for India should notify Sir Percy Cox that the presentation of our draft Mandat s to the League of Nationsmay be called for at any moment,and that accordingly the Government wish to knowwbm^har he- anproves of th&apos;:- di-aft mandate for Mesopotamia in its present form, whichhe has with him, or whether he attaches im-portance to further delay&apos;:(b) That the question should be reserved pendingthe receipt of Sir Percy Cox&apos;s report.
(10) At the conclusion of the Cabinet meetingLORD MILKER drew attention to e telegram he hadreceived from Mr.Hughes, the Prime Minister of Australia,In T^hich he expressed the opinion that it was absolutely essential that the prime Ministers of the Dominions should meet in London next year in order to deal with manypressing questions of common interest, such as shipping,trade, development of resources, wireless telegraphy,defence and naval establishments, and more especially,with the urgent necessity for arriving at a common policyin foreign affairs end for finding some workable machiiieryby which this can be secured.It was agreed  That the Secretary of State for the colonies should send to the Governors-General of Canada,New Zealand and South Africa, a telegram trans-mittlng an appropriate telegram from the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom to the primeMinisters of the Dominions, suggesting that ameeting of the Imperial Cabinet should be held,on the lines of the Imperial War Gobi-net meetingsla 1917-18, not later than June next year.    Atthis meeting the more urgent problems which hnweaccumulated should be dealt with and en attempt should be made to devise come practical workingme tho d for arriving at a common Imperial policyin f o re I gn s f f si r s.The composition, agenda, and meeting placeof the Constitutional Conference,  contemplated in 1917 to be held after the War, should alsobe discussed.Whitehell  ordens, S.W.I.12th October, 19 20.imperial cabinet.proposed meeting.
