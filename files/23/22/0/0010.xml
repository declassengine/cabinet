LEAGUE SP (1) The Cabinet were informed that the League of NationsNATIONS.-- was bound, unde&quot; the Covenant, to set up an InternationalI -hemationalCourt of Jus- Court of Justice. A Committee had been appointed, which hadtice.produced a unanimous Report regarding the constitution ofthis Court,  and It was necessary that a small Committeeshould be appointed to examine this Report critically,  sothat the views of the British Government on it might beavailable by the time the General Assembly of the League met in November next.The Cabinet agreed  That the Lord Chancellor, together withthe Law Officers of the Crown,  should examine the Report of the League ofNations Committee with regard, to theestablishment of an international court of Justice and advise the Cabinet
119X JL o(S) The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum byi/hedMiniater of Health and the Miniate&quot; of Labour (Paper C.P.-174?) relating to Unemployment,It was stated that in the coming Autumn theunemployment problem might constitute a serious danger, andthat in order to try and lessen this danger it was necessarythat the Government should be prepared with some scheme toprovide employment during the winter months.    There wereominous warnings that in certain trades,  owing to lack of ;orders, there would be discharges on a large scale.    In addi-tion to this, there was the presence of 300,000 ex-Servicemen totally unskilled,  for whom it was now impossible to findwork.    In the circumstances,  it was proposed that a strongCabinet Committee should be appointed to make recommendations as to the measures which might be necessary for dealing withthis problem and to explore the proposals which the Ministerof Health and the Minister of Labour had put forward in their memorandum.    Further, it was asked that this .Committee mighthave executive power to make - offers to Local Authorities, inthe event - of &quot;theijr--beirjg^ai^e ^ornai^scheme,on which men might be employed, which would relievedistress in their legalities,  of a Government- contribution of  1 for every  1 the Local Authorities &quot;would contributed tothe cost of the undertaking.   With&apos; regard to this-sa^e-si^Loox^it was contended that this would lead to manufacturing, work with which the nation-could dispens-e,  for the relief of theunemployed when there was other work, such as houses, whichwere most urgently required.    It was further &apos; suggested &quot;that&apos;it might be necessary for the Government to. take a drasticstep with, regard to the -attitude of skilled labour in thebuilding trade in refusing to. allow the employment. of&apos;;un-&apos;skilled labour.The Cabinet agreed --&apos;That a Committee should be appointed,composed as. follows :-

EXTRACT FROM TEE CONCLUSIONS OP A MEETING OF THE cabinet held AT 10, PO&apos;.&apos;l,!TNG STREET, S.PV,  ON FRIDAY,  AUGUST 13th,,1920 , AT 11.30 1.11.IRELAND...       (4)    The Cabinet had under consideration the position ofthe ten or twelve English Civil Servants now attached tothe Irish Executive.Position ofErg-lush Civil       Tho Chancellor of the Exohequer etatod that up to theSorvautsatta Pied to       present those men had been immune from tho attaoks ofthe irish executive - Sinn Fain, but he feared now that the Restoration of Orderin Ireland Bill had been passed, that such a conditionof affairs might not continue.      Up to the present thesemen had net lived in the Castla, but the Chief Secretaryagrosd with him that it was now necessary for them todo so,        In the circumstances, their usefulness to&quot; theIrish Executive must be greatly diminished and he enquir-ed whether they should not be recalled^ On tho etherhand,  it was stated that the danger to those Ci^ilServants was not sc great as o^ggestsd, and that the factcf these ton or twelve men being in the Castle would not affect the efficiency of the Civil Servants who remainidoutside the Castle to the dsgroo which had been anticipatedIt was strongly urged that they should be allowed toremain.The Cabinet agreed. -That tho presence in Ireland of the  tenor twelve English Civil Servants new attachedto the Irish Executive was still desirable,and that they should resido in Dublin Castle.2, Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.,27th.

THE IRISH (5) Arising out of the discussion --recorded&quot; in the^e-vixrus-^ow doub-t-^as -expressed as to whether theRestoration of Order in Ireland Act would succeed for any length of time unless the opinion of this country was behind it.    Strong measures would be required to put down thepolicy of the extremists,  and there might come&apos;a point.whenpublic opinion would desert the Government..    Even if theAct&apos;was successful, there would be no party left in Irelandwith which&quot;the Government could negotiate a settlement.The position at present was that the Six Counties wantedHome Rule for themselves, and would not be content simply to remain part of the United Kingdom,    In the South and Westthere was no Unionist Party in the old sense left.    Many ofthem were embracing, hnwever reluctantly, the new ideas, andwere not unwilling to make use of the Sinn Fein Courts.    In-the &quot;circumstances it was necessary that the Government shou]review its policy and &quot;the length it could go in the way of&apos; concessions.It was stated that the Prime Minister had made theposition of the Government clear in this respect on more -thaone occasion, and had expressed the limits within which theGovernment were prepared to negotiate.    It was suggested,however, that there would be an advantage if the positionof the Government could be  re-stated by the Prime Minister&quot;on the adjournment of Parliament next week.A draft of a fresh announceiaent was then read and considered by the Cabinet  (Appendix).    It was believed insome quarters that such, an announcement, which did not diffe:in substance from those already made, would, secure thesupport of the &quot;Freeman&apos;s Journal&quot;,  the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, theandSouthern Unionists and the Nationalists, ,.if made by thePrime Minister would encourage the Civil Servants and police in Ireland in the discharge of their difficult dutiesThe Cabinet agreed^ --That an announcement on the lines of thedraft in the Appendix, should be made bythe Prime Minister on the Motion for theAd Jonrament.^ -

APPEND! X,SUGGESTED ANNOUNCEMENT CM THE IRISH Q.UES-TION, TO BP. MADE BY TEE PRIME MINISTER ONTHE.MOTION FOR THE ADJOURNMENT.I thought I had already made the position on the IrishQuestion clear,   but lest there be any doubt  I will repeatit.   -We wiUinot break the pledges which successive governments have piven to the six counties of Ulster.    They must not becoerced to any form of government which they do not desire.We will not have a Republic.    Let there be no ambiguity - by that  I mean England will insist on keeping control of the-Navy, the Army, the ports for strategic purposes, Internation-al affairs and coinage *We are willing to pay a great price for peace, and within these limits we are willing to negotiate with s&amp;y body or persons who car. an sure us that an Act drawn within theselimits will ensure peace.    Beyond those limits we will nevergo, and if Ireland does not choose to negotiate within themthen there can be no peace, but unending strife.    It is forth* Irish ne owle to secure agreement  amongst themselveswithin those limits.&apos;
