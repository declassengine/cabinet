(1)    With reference to Cabinet 5? (30), Conclusion 1,the Cabinet had an emergency meeting to consider a threatenedbreakdown in the negotiations for the settlement of the Strike.The Prime Minister explained the point at issue, farmers-tioning that he had felt he could not take a decision involving-ing a possible rupture of the negotiations without consulting the Cabinet, though he had ventured to tell the Miners&apos; Exscutive that there was little doubt as to what view the cabinet would take.Since the last meeting of the Cabinet, a definite och .. &amp;had been drafted to give effect to the principles approved by the Cabinet.    It had been submitted to the Cpalcwriers at ameeting of the Mining Association.    They had accepted it withsome reluctance, but had been willing to work it,When the draft scheme had been presented to the Execu-tive of the Minors&apos;  Federation,  they had intimated theirwill in. ness to accept a downward scale for the reduction ofTacps in the ev^nt of a failure to realise profits correspond??ing to an output of 245, COO,POP tens.    They had, however,rejected the application of the scale to profits oorresprnd-ing to an output exceeding 246,000,000 tons.    They had urgedthat in the - event of profits being available above thisfijzure, the question of wages should be reconsidered by thoMiners and the Mi^sowners.As ther-s vras a reasonable prospect of a considerably increased output, this might mean that in January the wholecontroversy might be reopened and a fresh strike begun.    Thuis  to say,  the principle of an automatic scale we and dowoon which the Government Representatives hod throughoutinsisted, would,  in the event of an increased output abovetho figure mentioned, not apply.The truth appeared to bo that many of the members ofthe Executive of the Winers&apos;  Federation strcrvly dislikedthe principle of relating wages to output,  on which thisscheme, though camouflaged, was really based.
2StIhad endeavoured repeatedly to limit its application in dointGoi  time.    For example,  at one point they hat pressed that thescheme for a permanent settlement should he ready by january-&apos;ary 1st., ^bich mould enable them: to reopen the questionif that scheme &quot;/ere not ready.    Others disliked the schemebecause they understood it so imperfectly and believed theymould have great difficulty in explaining it to the men.In the course of the discussion it was suggested that a somewhat mo.e favourable upward scale might secure peace.It -as pointed out, however,  that the opposition had not&quot;en to th&quot; proposed scale itself,  and its alteration indetail had not been pressed.    The opposition was really tothe principle of an output scale and to binding the Bxeou-tive to an automatic movement.The Cabinet approved the position taken up by the Prime Minister and-his colleaguesen ft aged in the Strike Negotiations.CONTINUANCE (2) With reference to a Conference hold on October IB,0? GUARANTEEDSTANDARD WEEK 1920, at 6 p.m.,  the Minister o ? Transport raised the ques-PCR RAILWAY-finland. tion as to whether he mas to continue paying the guaranteedweek1s mages to railwaymen.The Cabinet agreed  ^hat    pending further developments of theStrike Negotiations,  the payment 0* the guaranteed week should continue.UNEMPLOYMENT.        (5)    With reference to Conclusion 1 of a Conference heldWages for on October 21, 1920,  the Cabinet agreed  Read ftork.That a Conference of ministers shouldbe&quot; held that day in Mr Penar law s Rook&apos;,at th&quot; house of Commons,  at 5-30 p.mm ,to consider the rate of &quot;:ages to be p-idfor road work to men engaged op Unempicy-ment Schemes,.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.vV. 1,October 2R;, 1920.
