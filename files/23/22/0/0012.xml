GERMAN TREATY SITUATION IN UPPER SILESIA

(l) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the situation in Upper Silesia and to the resignation there of four British officers on the Allied Commission in consequence of the alleged failure of the commission to exercise impartiality. It was suggested that full reports should be invited from the British officers concerned and that, if necessary, the whole question should be raised with the Allies.

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that he had already tale? action in regard to this matter.(Telegram No. 1000 to Lord Derby dated 15th September 1920.)

LETTER FROM ? SIMONS.

(2) The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that while at Lucerne he had received a telegram from Dr. Simons, the German Foreign Minister, stating that the Russian Soviet Government had placed contracts in Germany for some thousands of locomotives and asking if British banking houses would be authorised to finance the undertaking. He had referred the question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The Secretary reported that he had recently received tho Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s reply and forwarded it to the Prime Minister.

The subject was reserved.
LEWIS ISLAND VISIT OF SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.

(3) The prime Minister said he had received a letter from the Secretary for Scotland ashing his advice whether, in view of the threatened coal strike, it would be safe for him to carry out a visit to the Island of Lewis in accordance with a parliamentary pledge, to compose differences which had arisen there.

The Secretary was instructed to notify Secretary for Scotland that in the view of the Cabinet there was no objection to his proposed visit to Lewis.

THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL CONFERENCE AT GENEVA.

(4) The  attention of the Cabinet was called to a telegram from the British Ambassador at Washington (Sir Auckland Geddes) reporting a conversation with the Secretary of State which showed that the American      delegate on the Reparations Commission,in opposing the proposed financial conference at Geneva had not represented the views of the United States Government.

The attention of the Cabinet was also called to a note from the Secretary to the Prime Minister recording a conversation with the Belgian Ambassador who had transmitted a message from Monsieur Delacroix,the Belgian Prime Minister. This was to the effect that, though in favour of the original proposal agreed to at Spa to hold a financial conference at Geneva,he had been so impressed with Monsieur Millerand&apos;s political difficulties in giving effect to it that he had made a counter proposal that the question should be dealt with, in the first instance, at Paris by the Reparations Commission, who should examine the German proposals and report to the Allied Governments, who would afterwards consider their Report, possibly at Geneva. M. Delacroix hoped that the British Government would be able to agree to his proposal and had expressed his willingness to come to London to discuss the matter with the, Prime Minister. The
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs14 8ir.forr.ied the Cabinet that,at the request of the Princr11 inls ter ,hc had conferred with Sir L.

? UKRAINE ?

(6)The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to telegram No.540 of 10th September 1920 from Lord Kilmarnock, in which the latter stated that in a recent interview with the Ukraine Charge d&apos;Affaires in Berlin it had been represented inter alia that the British Military Authorities were still actively assisting General Wrangel, and also enquiring whether any change had taken place in the attitude of the British Government towards the question of the recognition of General Wrangel. On the latter point it was agreed that the Secretary of State should give an unqualified answer to the effect that the British Government had not recognised and had no intention of recognising General Mr Wrangel. As regards the alleged activities of British officers it was  agreed that the Prime Minister should ascertain the facts from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

?

(7) The attention of the Cabinet was called to Telegram No. 333 from Mr Tallonts (Riga) to the Foreign Office, dated 10 September 1920, in which he asked for instructions as to his correct attitude towards the Bolshevist Peace Delegation, and in particular whether he should receive them, and whether he should keep in touch with them for the purpose of reporting the course of the negotiations.

The Cabinet agreed that a reply should be sent to the effect that Mr Tallonts should not formally receive the Bolshevist Peace Delegation, or take any other stop which might be regarded as a form of ?gnition, but that he should have such ? with both part? the peace negotiations as might be necessary to enable him to report their programs.


(8)       The attention of the Cabinet was directed toa recent telegram from Hr Herman, the British Ministerat Teheran (No.625 of llth September 1920)stating tintthe decision of General Ilaldcne to withdraw certaintroops from Persia to reinforce troops in Mesopotamia -was likely to have disastrous effects in Persia.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that he had seen the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff,who had caused a telegram to be cent tcGeneral Haldane deprecating the withdrawal of theparticular troops in question, but containing a passage to the effect that,if, in General Haldane13 opinion,it was necessary in order to save the situation InMesopotamia to withdraw the whole of the British troopsin Persia.j he was to bo at liberty to take this  course.He demurred to this latter statement which appeared toconflict with the decision cf    tho Cabinet on 17thAugust last (Cabinet 49(20) Conclusion o, Appendix: 1Conclusion 1).It uas agreedThat the Prime Minister should discuss thisquestion with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff before the meeting of theCabinet fined for the morning of V/odnesday,September 15th.
TREATY OF VERSAILLES.

Compensation for Destroyed Airships.

(9) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a telegram from the British Ambassador in Paris (Lord ?) to the Foreign Office (No. 1082, dated September 10th, 1920, para. 10.) in regard to the compensation to be demanded from Germany for certain Zeppelin airships which had been destroyed by the Germans instead of being bonded over in connection with the Treaty of Versailles. Lord Derby himself had proposed that financial compensation should be demanded; but the Allied Aeronautical Commission of Control in Berlin had recommended to the Ambassadors conference that Germany should be compelled to build a number of Zeppelins, equivalent to those destroyed, to be handed over to the Allies; and the Germans were understood to be prepared to undertake this. In the absence of instructions, Lord Derby had not pressed his point; and the Conference of Ambassadors had decided in accordance with the recommendations of the Aeronautical Commission of control.

In view of the difficulty in disposing of the surplus British airships and on grounds of general policy, the Cabinet agreed:

That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct Lord De?ly to press the Ambassadors Conference ? some form of compensation from ? other than the construction of ?

This question could be -raised on&apos; Item&apos; 5&quot; 6T&quot; the&quot; Agenda paper, viz,, &quot;Admission of Statesnot named in tho Annex to the Covenant. &quot;
(Id)    The Cabinet were ihTorraed that thepresent tnouble began last July when certain members of the 2.T.U. employed in the works of messrs Cammell Laird and Co., Sheffield, struckwork because one of their number, who hadbeen appointed a foreman, wished to continue his membership of tho Union - which the Employersdeclined to allow.     The strike wari not at firstrecognised by the loaders of the Union.    Subsequently the Employers&apos; Federation issued notices witha vies to locking out all members of the E-T.TJ.employed by the Federation.     After these noticeshad boon posted, but before the lock-out hadtaken effect, the Ministry of Labour intervenedand suggested that tho Employers should holdup the notices and that the men on strike should return to work ponding, the holding of an enquiry into the facts by the Ministry.     Tho men agreedto return to work if  the Employers would withdraw the notices.     This the latter refused to do - withthe result that all the men, numbering severalthousands, are now locked out.On the 9th September, a mass mooting ofLondon Stewards demanded that the EngineeringFederation should conform to tho request of theMinistry of Labour; failing which, they decidedto give seven days&apos;  strike notice      The nextworkdaw strike notices wore Issued; and-/      willactually cease on the Tubes and on all Kloctrlcalundertakings In London on.Saturday next unless some solution can bo found in tho interval.
It Is improbable- that the Court of Enquiryfill be able to report definitely beforeSaturday; and the Employers have, up to thepresent, declined to accent any proposal whichwould In any way fetter their right to promotemen to bo foremen.The position is further complicated bythe fact that the supervisors who are members *fthe E.P.M.A. and who have hitherto sided withthe Employers have nor; decided to fall into line with, the men.     The supervisors may issuenotices on Saturday nextj but, as these noticeswill.not   in some cases expire for a month andin ether cases for a fortnight, their labour will not bo withdrawn at once.It was felt that, in the event of a strike,public opinion would bo hostile to tho Employerson account of their refusal to accept theMinistry of Labor.r suggestion, and that It was most important at the present moment, in viewof the coal crisis, that the labour situation should not be complicated by an Electricians1strike.Ultimately, ..t was: agreed that the prime minister tor end the Lord Privy Seal should inter-view Sir Allan Smith, the Chairman of theEmployers5 Federation, and represent to him the very difficult situation which would arise in tho went of a strike aril endeavour to por-persuade him to use his influence with the Fccior-ation to vrithdraw the lock-out notices pendingthe report. of the Court of Enquiry.it

(15) (Mr Bridgeman and the Coal Controller now entered)

The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that there had been no change in the situation. He had ascertained that considerable discussion was taking place within the Triple Alliance: and the division of opinion there was reflected in labour circles throughout the country. He anticipated that the men would make some move in the course of the next few days. Their attitude in the matter s?uld, no doubt, be influenced by the figures published that morning by the Board of Trade shewing that there would be no surplus out of which the demand for the reduction of the price of coal could be met.

The Cabinet were informed that the miners&apos; Federation were finding considerable difficulty in raising funds for the strike. This was due, to some extent,to the fact that money which had been lent to tho Co-operative Societies was not available at the moment. Attention was also called to the attacks which were being made on the Government which was being accused of endeavouring to subvert Trade Union organisations and was alleged to be contemplating the decontrol of coal prices.

The Cabinet agreed:

That the Prime Minister should publish forthwith a statement  of the Government position with Sogard to these matters. (A copy of the statement issued by the Prime Minister is attached. See Appendix)
(16) The attention of the Cabinet was directed to10H the statement appearing in the press to the effectthat M.Eamoneff was adhering to the attitude adopted by him at his recent mooting with the primeMinister, and it was suggested that the Governmentshould either publish an account of the interview with the intercepted telegrams, or issue a statement to the affect  that they were in pc&amp;sos3ion of facts which would satisfy any ran, whatever his politicalopinions,  that M.Mamencff&apos;s version oi the transactionswas untrue:    that ho was intimately connected withthe sale of tho precious stones and the handing over of the proceeds:  and that ho had communicated his action to his Government.The view was expressed that having regard tothe extent to which M.Klishko was implicated in thevarious transactions, stops should bo taken with avie?.&apos; to his hoing sent out of the country.It was agreed:That the President of the Board of education should draft a short statement on tho abovelinos for the consideration of the Cabinet,(17) The Cabinet agreed:-That the Prime Minister should authorise Mr Pise to resume the dis-cussions with the representativesof the Allies concerned with a viewto the completion of the negotiationsfor the re-oponirig of trade withRussia.hit eMail G ar dons , S * 17.sJ^ihSoptembor, 1920
The Prime Minister has addressed thefollowing reply to a eor respondent, whoasked what was the attitude of the Govern-taent towards the decontrol of the coalindustry, and whether there was any truth in the suggestion that the Government was seeking to attack trade unions:-On the question of the decontrol of the coal industry, I entirelyconfirm what Sir Robert horne ha3 already said about this matter.It is the considered        policy of the Government, as explained to Parliament, gradually to free the coal industry from government control, but so long as the present discrepancy co.nti.nueo hiiv/eeh theexport price and the home price - which is regulated by the cot u ofproduction - it is the intention of the Government to retain uomeform of control of pit-head prices.Long before the present, claim was ever; urged the Government hadbeen regulating the price of coal cor homo consumption, -ly as August 16th,      *   by the Mining Industry Act, theyto continue the control of prices for a further period of 13 months.muchUntil the export price apprroriimaten/more closely to the honeprice, it is the Intention of tho Govevnmenb to retain some form ofpit-dead prices, and of the quantity ok Loved for export, in orderthat tho  ooal required for domestic aul industrial consumption maybe afforded to our people at a reasonable price.The suggestion that the Government is seeking to attack the tradeunions of the country is prepos toroua .She Government has always recognised that tho trade union organis-ation is vital to tho interests of Labour, and it has conoiotohCLyaccepted the principle that trade unions should represent the interestsof their members in the whole industrial field.Hot only has that principle been accept&quot;!, but, &amp;yth in legislation and in administration, the position of trade unions has been fully recognised.Ho better example could be cited than the- dealings of the Governmentwith tiie Miners&apos; Federation.In all questions affecting the wages and conditions of labour in themining industry, the right of the Federation to speak and negotiate onbehalf of itsa members has never been question&apos; &apos;But if a trade Union, or any section ox tho community, attempt a &apos;to usurp the functions committed to   &quot;     Government by the whole body ofthe people^ such a claim must be unhesitatingly resisted.It is those who make such a claim, not those to resist it, whoimperil the record, tho position and tho work of the trade unions.
