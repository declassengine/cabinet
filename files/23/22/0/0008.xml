With reference to Conclusion ? of a Conference of Minis-ters held on July 25,  1930, the Prime Minister gave theCabinet an account of the situation as regards Poland arisingout of an interview of five hours&apos;  duration which he and MrBonar Law had had with MM. Karaerieff and Krassin on Friday,August 6th, when he had endeavoured to arrange an immediatetruce between the Russian Soviet armies and the Poles.    Pol-lowing this interview he had arranged a meeting to take place at Lyropne,  Kythe,   on Sunday and Monday, August S and 9,  atwhich he himself, accompanied by Lord Curson ana Mr Balfour,the First Sea Lord (Lord Beatty), and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff (Sir Henry Wilson) had met M, Millerand, marshal foch and ll% Berthelot.    During this meeting, a wireless tele-pram en glair from the Soviet Government to M. Kameneff hadbeen intercepted, which was tantamount to a refusal of the truce, and thereafter the discussion had been conducted onthis assumption.(A summary of, the Prime Minister&apos;s statement is attached&apos; -- see &quot;Appendix IThe Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to approve theResolutions (see Appendix II) and the Declaration to Poland(see Appendix III) .In the subsequent discussion great stress was laid on thevery strong public opinion against intervention in the Russo-Polish War, and during the meeting information was received to the effect that several Parliamentary Labour organisationswere meeting, and it was apprehended that Labour might endeavours-our to prevent the intervention of Great Britain by declaringa general strike.It was generally agreed that, in his statement in Parlia-ment on the following day,  the Prime Minister would have to observe the greatest caution in any reference to the circum-stances in which MM. Kameneff and Krassin would have to leavethe country in the event contemplated in the agreed Resolu-tions,  and it was suggested that the best plan would be to
onmention that the Soviet delegates would be required to leavethe country only if and when the various forms of actioncontemplated in the Resolutions were put into operation.The Cabinet approved the arrangement aentered into by the Prime Minister andhis colleagues with the Representativesof the French Government.Whitehall Gardens,.

A P P B N D J XI.QSUMMARY OP STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRIMEMINISTER TO THE CABINET ON THE SUBJECTOF TRF ANGLO-FRENCH CONFERENCE AT LYWPNEON AUGUST B &amp; 9,  1920.The Cabinet were informed that the French Delegates,whoexpressed strong anti-BoIs he vik views, had intimated that france wag becoming distinctly anti-pole.    In this connec-tion,   reference was made to a letter addressed to M. Millerandby the French Ambassador at Warsaw, containing a very graveindictment of the Polish Government, which habitually acted in defiance of the advice given by the Allies, both in poli-tical and military matters, with the result that the Allieswere faced with the -present deplorable situation.    MarshalPilsudski was suspected of being ready to make peace at anyprice,  even if this meant the setting up of a Soviet Govern-raent  in Poland,  provided only that his own position was assured.    Notwithstanding the fact that the Soviet army wasbadly disciplined and had few supplies, it had encounteredno serious resistance and was rapidly advancing, simply owingto the refusal of the Polish troops to fight;    and,  in theview of the French, treachery on the part of the Poles mightbe expected.    a3 indicating the kind of political measureswhich the French delegates thought should be taken, a draft note,  prepared by M. Berthelot, was cited. (See Annex &quot;A&quot;.)In these circumstances, Marshal Foch and Sir Henry Wilsonwere asked for their views on the military situation.    Theseare contained in the Note attached to.Appendix II.    It wasmade clear that the recommendations in (b) of this Note are based on the polish Government undertaking, to conduct a vigorous and real defence in the event of a rupture of the contemplated peace negotiations.    As regards supplies,(b)(i), the British Government would be called upon forboots,  clothes and saddlery, and the French Government would
Q ?be responsible for- aras, munitions, etc. AS regards (b)(ii)--interrupt,ion of contact between Russia and the outside world --efe*enofl ma^e to the difficulties of maintaining a formal blockade in the Baltic in the absence of a naval base,but it would be possible to stop most of the slender suppliesnow reaching Russia by sea.    The Conference had agreed that neither Great Britain nor Prance could find additional troopsbeyond, possibly,  one or two French Battalions which might be moved from Teschen to Danzig.    There was no reason to think -that Polish man-power was inadequate, but capable leaders were badly needed.The Prime Minister then stated that he had iropr-eased onthe French Delegates the critical state of British publicopinion on this question.    The working-classes were franklyhostile to intervention, and this view was shaded by Conserva-tive opinion, as was clearly indicated in the Press.    In thesecircumstances it was necessary to consider whether the Alliescould possibly take action against Russia at the presentmoment, when the Poles had accepted a parley and before theAllies knew what terns the Soviet wished to impose on thePoles and what attitude the Poles would adopt towards such terms.    Moreover, could the Allies properly take action ifthe Soviet imposed terms of a very severe nature (insisting,for example, on the setting up of a Soviet in Poland) andthe Poles decided in favour of acceptance?He had told the French Delegates that the BritishRov^-n-i^P could not ask the House of Commons to sanctionany addition to existing burdens in respect of Poland beforethe Allies knew the result of the Minsk negotiations.    Siroi-larly, with regard to the second point, British public opinion would not tolerate the British Government adopt inc. an atti-tude more Polish than the Poles themselves,.    If, therefore ,the Poles accepted harsh terms, they must abide by theconsequences.
The French had urged that the Treaty of Versailles wasendangered by the present situation, that the. Bolsheviksdid not really desire peace but were intent on anarchy andrevolution and should be fought now.    He had explained thatthis was hot a view which the British Government could support,ana he had made it clear that Great Britain could only extendher support to &apos;eland on the basis of the preservation of polish independence, the Allies to decide whether the Russianterms amounted to the negation of that independence.Ultimately the French had agreed to accept the Britishviews, and the agreement had been incorporated in the Resolu-tions (see fVgPg ad ix 11).    It had also been agreed to make an allied Declaration to Poland (see Appendix III).The Conference had then considered the difficult questionof th9 action to be taken towards MM, Kameneff and Krassin.The French had been told that these Russian delegates had cometo England to discuss trade questions, and not the question oi&apos;Poland.    On the trade issues the Soviet had accepted all theBritish conditions.    It was quite clear, however, that, in theevent of a rupture with the Soviet on the Polish question, itwould be necessary to request MM. Kameneff and irrassin to leaveGreat Britain.    The French had contended that the Sovietdelegates should be turned out at once, on the ground that theywere not tiustworthyj but ultimately had agreed to the ar-rarifrements set out in IV of Appendix II.
ANNEX      ,(An.Q AO -1DRAFT NOTE prepared byj&quot; adgo3?at the ANG-LO-BERTHS LOT jforconsidaration!*&quot;, EYTHEl onThe political measures which it would appear possible totake to put pressure on Russia to respect the independence ofPoland are as follows:-(a) Informal re-imposition of blockade:(b) Support of Poland in her struggle for independence.    This would involve the holding of Danzig so long as Polandholds out against the Bolsheviks:(c) Support of Wrangel with militarymaterial and advice, with the objectof stirring up disaffection in theUkraine and the Caucasus.    But thisprobably carries with it the necessityof guaranteeing that, in the event of&apos;failure and defeat, the Allies willprotect Wrangel within the Crimeauntil satisfactory terms are arranged:(d) Declaration to border States, i.e.sFinland , Esthonia, Latvia5 Lithuania.Roumania, Georgia, that if they will immediately organise their defensive preparations against Bolshevist attacksthe Allies will assist with material and advice.    Defensive preparationswould compel the Bolsheviks to maintainsome counter-defensive preparations, and,in view of Soviet attack on Poland, assist-ance for this purpose could not be objected to by Labour opinion.    To go further and invite them to take offensive action would almost certainly mean&apos; that the Allies wouldbe called upon to guarantee their integrity and independence in the event of the Bol-sheviks counter-attaoking:(e) Organisation cf active propaganda to showto Russian people that re-imposition of blockade and continuance of a state of waris sole 17/ due to policy of Soviet autbori-ties in interfering with affairs of othercountries and trying to impose Sovietsystem upon them.
POLAND.RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY TEE BRITISH AND FRENCHDELEGATIONS AT THE MEETING AT LYMPNE, HYTHE.ON MONDAY, AUGUST 9, 1920.I. The Allies are agreed:-(l) That the only ground upon which they can undertakehostile action against Russia is to assist thePolish people to &quot;mainfin their independence within their ethnographic frontier:(2) That they will not interfere in the internal affairs of Russia provided Russia does not interfere in the affairs of other nations:(3) That they will not declare a final breach withRussia until the result of the Minsk negotia-tions is clear:(4) That if the Polish Government, after hearing the policy of the Allies as defined in theseResolutions; comes to terras with Russia * theground for Allied action against Russia lapses,unless the Treaty of Versailles is therebyinfringed.II. On these conditions , arid if the Soviet Government attempts to impose terms on Poland incompatible with its independence,the Allies are agreed to take common action to assist thePolish people to defend their independence, provided:-(a) That their action will not involve thedespatch of further Allied troops to Poland:(b) That the Polish Government accepts and actsupon the military advice tendered to it bythe Allies.III. The common action they will take in the event of Russia notrespecting the independence of Poland, and until such time asthat recognition is given, will be as stated in the aoeompany-ing Note.IV. The British Government, after consulting the other Allies,will inform the Soviet Government and MM. Kameneff and Krassinthat the Allies have initiated the action they propose to take%o support Poland in its struggle ior independence, and that
unless an agreement of the above character has been reached between Poland and Russia by Sunday night next, relations ofall kinds will be broken off and MM. Aameneff and Krassin willbe required to leave England immediately, unless in the interval tney have engaged or engage in propaganda, in w-hichcase theib stay will be immediately terminated.N 0 T S.The military and naval means available for exercisingpressure on the Soviet Government with a view to obtaining aguarantee for the independence of Poland may be summed up asfollows:-A declaration by the Allied Governments to the PolishGovernxaent, saying: -If the Polish Government does not accept theRussian armistice or peace terms, and if itis decided to struggle energetically for theindependence of the&quot;countryi it is asked to declare this publicly and to come to an under-stanciing with the Allied Governments as to themeasures to be taken with this object in view,and which would include:-(a) On the part of the Polish Government:-(i) The designation of a Commander-in-Chiefof the Polish Armies -without any otherfunctions5 assisted by Allied Officers:(ii) The maintenance of the Polish Army at a strength of 22 Divisions completed asfar as possible to their normal effectives:(iii) The defence at all costs of the line ofthe Vistula in case the line held atthis moment by the Polish armies cannotbe maintained.(b) On the part of the Allied Govermientg.(i) The supply to the Polish Army maintained at 22 Divisions of the means of armament and various materials and,in addition?of officers for this Army:(ii) Interruption of contact -between Russiaand the outside world, whether by naval action or by international action:(iii) Support to General vvrangel1 s army:(iv) The propaganda accompanied by proposalseffected in Baltic States, in Roui-aniaand in the Caucasus:(v) Employment of the means necessary for themaintenance of the communicate at ions of theAllied Powers with Poland.
****ANNEX. ^ 4THE BLOCK APE AND OTHER NAVAL. MEASURES.THE BALTIC.1.    II a blockade is to be used as a measure of pressure, and of pressure only without any declaration ot war, we can carry out a blockade of the Russian coast in the Baltic, provided thatconsideiable risk is accepted that our blockading force may bedriver, oil with loss by a superior enemy force.2.    If Helsingfors can be used as a &quot;case, the blockade in theBaltic will be effective.3.    If Finnish aerodroi;.x3 s are available, aircraft can be used forreconnaissance purposes and possibly for torpedo attaok on theships at Kronstadt.4.    Revalj through which most of the imports enter Russia, wouldhave to be included in the blockade.5.    Failing Helsxngf oi-s, the base of operations would be Danzig,but owinp to Its distance (300 miles) from the line of blockadewhich would have to be maintained, the blockade in this case would not be so effective.6.    If Dan ig fell into the enemy1s hands, or became unavailable,no blockade would be possible in the Baltic unless we couldutilise a neutral port.THE BLACF PEA.7i As regards naval operations in the Black Sea, the first step Isto re-establish the Naval Mission at General Wrangel1s head-quaxters.    The following operations could be undertaken:-(a) To convey General Wrangel&apos;s iorces to any point in&apos; the Black Sea &quot;and Sea of Azov andto cover their disembarkation:(b) To support the flanks of General wrangel&apos;s army where they rest on the sea:(c) To harass the Bolshevist forces on the coastroads whenever they are to be found:(d) To blockade the Russian coast in occupationof the Bolsheviks:(e) To cairy out any operations on the sea which general Vv ran gel may require.
