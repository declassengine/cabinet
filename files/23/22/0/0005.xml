-policy. (1) She Cabinet bad under consideration certain questionsrespecting future Air Policy, e.g., the disposal of rigidfoisposal ofRigid Air- airships (Paper CP.1565) and proposed subsidies to AerialBhips.Transport Companies (Paper CP. 1265)The Cabinet were informed that during the war a sumof approximately  40,000,000 had been spent on the&apos;formationof an efficient Airship Service.     In the result, GreatBritain was now in the premier position in regard to thismatter, and possessed, in addition to the two airshipssurrendered by the Germans, a number of airships, completed and cxaiSiileting^ of- great value.      The Commercial..AirshipsCommittee had reported in iavour-^of&quot;&quot;utilising the aLrshipsfor- ^egular^XLights--to Egypt., at a total cost for the twoyears ending March 31st, 1921, of  844,400 on a Civil basis,or alternatively,  922,200 on a Service basis, of which 321,700 7/ould be required this year.     Every endavour hadbeen made, to pejcsuaile-commercial..firma-to-  ake over the air-ships, but without success.      while it was true that at themoment the, commer-cial world was not prepared to accept the risks incidental to the running of the service, many expertswere of opinion that airships had a great commereixl future.Moreover, the only alternative to the present proposals wasto scrap the ships,  etc., which would not only mean a ruptureand destruction of the service brought to its present state ofperfection, but would be criticised on the ground, that theGovernment should never have continued its policy of complet-ing the ships and should have taken a much earlier decisionto scrap them.      It was also explained that the life of these ships was very short, probably not more than about two years,and that it was therefore of little use to store them.7/hile it was possible that a commercial firm might beprepared to run the ships if the Government took a substantial

It w-as &quot;ih.ouglat-&quot;ii^osjaib^the proposed, addition. to the burdens on the Exchequer.It was. agreed -That the. Air Ministry should makefirrther endeavours to enter into. arrangements with commercial fims...    : for the disposal to then of the MAirships by sale or gift, on the basis. that the Government would undertakeno financial liability; failing such arrangements., the airships should bokept In store or scrapped.ubsidies to (2) The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumivil Aviationiby the Secretary of State for Air, covering the Reportsof the Advisory Committee.on Civil Aviation, from whichit appeared that a majority of the members of theCommittee had recommended that direct assistance shouldhe given to commercial Companies, limited to a naxlrrunsura of  250,000, within the two financial years 1920-1and 1921-2, and that payments to Companies   ;operating on approved, routes should be calculated onthe basis of 25 per cent of the total certified grossrevenue of each Company earned by the carriage of passengers, mails or goods.In a Minority Report, Air-Marslaal Sir H.Trencliardhad expressed himself opposed to the policy of subsidy on both military and commercial grounds.It was explained that, since the Report had been presented, the representative of one of the existing companies had stated that it had begun to pay its way with a turnover of  100,000 per annurai.iu&apos;these circumstances, the Air Ministry asked that the question night be postponed until the figures
given &quot;by the representative had been examined.The Cabinet agreed -To postpone further considerationo  the question, as desired by theAir Ministry.-3-

(4) Witfn^ie^Cafeiosl; - bad before them three Memoranda by the Minister of .0Labour,,. (Papers CP.1643, CP. 1660, and CP.1685) , urging thatthe present arrangements with regard to Out-of work Donationshould be extended for a further period ending November 8th, 19S0at. an estimated additional cost of  850.000.The Cabinet were informed that Out-of Work Donation firstbegan on November  5th, 1918, and the original policies entitled the holders, within 12 months after discharge from the Army, toan initial period of 26 weeks at 29/- a week, plus allowances fordependent children, and a further 13 weeks (for disabled men 20weeks) at 20/- a week plus children&quot;s allowances&apos;.      The firstspecial extension had operated from November 26th, 1919, to March31st, 19 20, within which period men might draw 9 weeks at 20/- aweek; and the second special extension had been given from April 1to July 31st, 1920, during which period a further 12 weeks at 20/&apos;-a week might be given.      At the present moment 143,000 men were onDonation, and, if no extension at all was given, 83,000 would continue to draw benefit under the existing schemes, but theremaining 60,000 would cease to benefit and would be added to the40,000 ex-Service men who had exhausted all Donation benefits.The problem &quot;was,  therefore, how to deal with these 100,000ex-Service men, most of whom would be in the towns, with no workand no income.      The men were mainly unskilled, and it was clearthat the demand for unskilled labour was very small.    IThile, nodoubt,  some of them were unemployable,, the great majority had madegenuine efforts to get work, without success..     It was not a caseof men refusing to take unskilled lobe.       If they did so, the consequence was that they came off Donation benefit.      j-. seriousslump in trade might be anticipated in the autumn, and the labour situation would be most gravely aggravated by driving large
numbers of these ex-Service men into the hands of the extremists *The best solution, in the view of the Ministry ofLabour, was to continue the present arrangements until theUnemployment.Insurance Act took effect.     In the meantime,every effort should be made to find work  or these men,either by means, of the Development Fund, the Road BoardFund., os? the National Relief Fund.     It might be possible: to employ some 10,000 to 15,000 of them on Mousing Schemes, anda number might be trained for semi-skilled employment,though this latter would admittedly cost money*On the other hand, it was pointed out that, &quot;accordingto- the latest information, a serious- slump in trade in theautumn need not be feared, though much depended on vdiether an.American financial crisis materialised In September.The attention of the Cabinet was directed to the very substantial pecuniary concessions which had been made Inthe past to the ex-ServIce men.     Apart from the month&apos;sfurlough, on full pay,, which it was estimated had cost 50^,000,000, the total cost up to date of grants to ex?&apos;Service^ excluding officers, in respect of matters suchas gratuities, Out-ol&quot;-work Donation, re-settlement grants jindustrial training of disabled men, Interrupted apprentice-ships, land settlement and overseas settlement, amounted to 128,820,0005 while the total cost to the end of theschemes would be  186,100,000-  (Appendix).    In addition,there was the annual charge of over  120,000,000 for PensionsIt was generally felt that further concessions should,if possible, be restricted to men who had actually servedoveruseas,but it was pointod out that some time must   inany case elapse before the records of the ex-Service men onDonation could be properly examined and collated for thispurpose-Ultimately the Cabinet agreed: -
(a) To grant a further extension of 8 weeks1 ,Donation at 20-/&apos;-- a week, under the eondit-idns already prevailing, the Donation tohe drawn within the period of 14 weeks from august 1 to November 0,1920:(b) That an immediate examination should bemade of the military records of all ex-?-Service men on Donation Benefit, with crview to restricting any further extensionafter November 8 which might bo necessaryto men who had served- overseas and. whosemilitary records were good.-7-
(5) With reference to Cabinet 37 (*?,0).., -OonoJAi*ii*fT5v*-Wie^attention of the Cabinet was diverted to the Report bv theChairvmn of the bloc-d Subsidy donriittee (Pape- CP.-1602),which in effect recommended that a progressive reductionof the Bread Subsidy should be made by throe successivestages, the final removal taking place on July 31, 1921.A Minority Report by Sir G.L. Bar stow (Paper CP.-1602 A)recOmr.ended the immediate abolition of the Subsidy, eventhough this night result in very extensive v/age demands.Finally, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour (Paper C.P.-1668) showing how Great Britaincompared with certain Continental countries as regards the quantities of bread purehaseable with-the daily wage atpresent, current in certain typical occupations.It was stated that the immediate abolition of theSubs idy would mean raising the price of the loaf at once toIs.3d.    In this connection it was pointed out that, even ifthis were done, the position of the British workman would atilbe far superior to that of his foreign compeer.    Moreover,the real position of the forme.&quot;&quot; was even more favourable than the figures showed, because in practice he spent, less of his total wage on bread than the foreigner.To keep the Subsidy at  45,000,000 per annum, itwould be necessary in any case to raise the price of the loafto Is .lfd. in November.It was generally agreed that it was desirable to abolish this Subsidy at the earliest possible date which wascompatible with an opportunity being given to the working marto adjust his arrangements to meet the increased cost of bread.    It was realised^, however, that abolition on theselines would mean demands from railwayman, miners and otherswhose waces depended on the index cost-of-living figures,but it was felt that from every point of view it was very desirable to get back as soon as possible to normal economimodes of life.
In reply to a suggestion that the abolition of the bread Subsidy must be followed by a removal of the maximunlimit price of-Home-grown wheat, It was pointed out thatthe farmer could have no real grievance at the maintenance ofthis, maximum limit, since his guaranteed price had not treenfixed by reference to the Bread Subsidy.It was also pointed out that if the cabinet&apos;s decision was published, there would be hoarding of wheat and flour,with, a consequential loss to the Exchequer.Ultimately it was agreed -(a) That arrangements should be made to ensurethe abolition of the Bread Subsidy by theend of the present calendar year, the priceof the loaf to be raised gradually duringthe next five months, so as to secure thatthe Subsidy terminated on December 31,1920.(b) That no public announcement of this decision should be made.
*IKG (6) With, reference to Cabinet 56 (20),Conclusion 2, the,q Cabinet had before them the Report of the Housing Committee(Paper C.P* 1593), which pointed out that the present housingdifficulties were mainly attributable (i) to shortage of labourand (ii) to inadequate output.     With regard to shortage oflabourj the Committee recommended that steps should be takento up-grade the unskilled man and to re-introduce the appren-apprenticeship system.It was generally felt that it v/ould. be necessary forthe Prime Minister to meet the representatives of the employ-ers and employees in the building trade and to press theCommitteeJs recommendations upon them.With regard to output, the Committee had recommendedthat improved conditions in the building trade were necessary,and that, in return for an undertaking by the employees notto strike, to work over time and to accept payment by results,a guaranteed week should be given, at all events for those engaged on housing schemes, the guarantee to take the form of full wages for two-third-    and half wages for the remainingone-third of the tir-ve.The Cabinet agreed -To adopt the recommendations of the HousingCommittee; the proposals affecting labour to provide a basis for the discussions totake place between the Prime Ministerandrepresentatives of the employers and work-people in the building industry.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1July 29th, 1920.
