9 ript8 IJJTER-ti0ka1JTUATION.russia.previous reference:cabinet 39(39)conclusion 5).litaryission.1, THE SECRETARY OP STAvE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat as regards Russia there were no particular develop-men ts to report to his colleagues.     A telegram had toeendespatch to Sir William Seeds on the 28th July (TelegramNo. 187 to Moscew) to the effect that it would he mistakentactics to offer M. Molotov another formula on   &quot;indirect aggression&quot;, and that we felt hound to adhere to our ownformula.     The French Government had agreed to this course.There was, perhaps, some reason to hope that, as a resultof our willingness to enter into Military Conversations withthe Soviet Government, M. Molotov might adopt a more reasonable attitude in this matter.The Foreign Secretary said that his colleagues would have noticed that the Tass Communigue which was published in the Press of that morning, had taken a somewhat more reasonable line than might have been expected in regard to the position of the Soviet Governmentvis-a-vis the StiltStates.The arrangements for the departure of a military mission to Russia had now been made.     It had beendecided to charter a merchant ship, the S.S. CITY OPEXETER, of the Ellerman Line, which would leave on saturday next.     This arrangement had been made after consideration of various alternatives, which, for one reason or another, were unsatisfactory.The Cabinet took note of this statement.***

THE INTER-KATIOKALSITUATIONi (Confd).Danzig.2.        THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR POREIG-N affairs said that as regards Danzig there was nothing ofimportance to report.   He had no official conflrma-tion of a rumour which had been current that thePolish Government desired to make an official(previous Ref-erence:   Cabinet protest in regard to recent events at Danzig.39(39), Conclu-sion 2.) In reply to a question, the Foreign secretary said that he did not think that any particularsignificance need be attached to the presence ofa German General In Danzig.The Foreign Secretary said that he hadobserved a certain tendency, when the Danzigposition was discussed, for it to be stated thatwe were committed to fight for Danzig.   He had been at pains to correct this statement.    The true position was that Danzig, of itself, should not beregarded as providing a casus belli.    If, however, a threat to Polish independnece arose from Danzig,then this country would clearly become involved.The Foreign Secretary added that he had had some conversation on these lines with Mr. winston churchill.   The latter had said that he had no wishto be more Polish than the Poles, but he was anxious that the Government should not put pressure on thePolish Government to take action which, in their view, would be destructive of their State.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

he INTERNATIONALJ^IJAT-ON (Contd. )rkey.previous reference:Cabinet 39(39)Conclusion 10. )3. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, at a Meeting held on the previous day, the ForeignPolicy Committee had discussed the draft political agreement with Turkey.     The Committee had authorised him to proceed on the basis of a draft Agreementframed on a broad reciprocal basis,     The main thoughtwhich had been uppermost in the minds of the membersof t.he Foreign Policy Committee had been that anAgreement with Turkey was fundamental to our whole position in the Mediterranean.     We therefore exposedourselves to no great risk if we promised that weshould lend Turkey all the support and assistance inour power if Turkey was the object of a direct attack.If Turkey felt that her posit ion was indirectlythreatened by an attack upon some other State, weundertook, according to the terms of the. draft Political.Agreement, to consult with her.      Mutatis Mutandis,if we were involved in war as the result of a german attack on Switzerland or Holland, Turkey would not automatically be obliged to come to our assistance,but only to consult with a view to action by agreement.The political negotiations with Turkey were also bound up v/ith the Turkish demands for increasedcredits and for a loan.      The Foreign Policy Committeehad reached the conclusion that it was necessary to^proceed as quickly as possible with the considerationof these matters,and to press the French to bear theirfair share in meeting the Turkish demands.      Some ofthese demands were, however, on an extravagant scale.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

THE UEEKR-- 4-       1112 SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSNATIONALSITUATION said that the position in the Far East was now(CONT&apos;D.)causing him more anxiety than the position in any-    .,.__       other part of the world.    Sir Robert Craigie was,The Position e - B &apos;at Tientsin:       ^ -thought, conducting the conversations in TokyoThe Tokyo *Negotiations.     With great skill in conditions of extreme difficulty.(Previous So far as concerned the purely localReference:Cabinet 39(39), -LSSues   such as the police and administrativeConclusion 6. jarrangements at Tientsin, matters had not proved toodifficult and a solution of these problems might beanticipated.    The Japanese, however, were nowraising matters of general policy, namely, thesilver in the Concessions at Tientsin and Peking,and currency matters.The Foreign Secretary said that, if he were convinced that we could reach some generalagreement with the Japanese, he would be prepared toput up with certain indignities in the meantime.    Hethought, however, that we could not ignore thepossibility that we might have to break with japan on these wider issues.    If this happened, it wouldbe necessary for us to choose very carefully theground on which the actual break should take place.Broadly, there were two grounds on which we couldbreak - the currency issue or the question of Britishhelp to China.    On the whole, if a break were to come,he thought it had better come on the latter issue which was capable of better presentation from thepoint of view of world opinion.In regard to the currency question, theFrench had adopted a helpful line and had said thatthey were not prepared to concur in any agreement reached on this matter in regard to which they had

not &quot;been consulted.    The attitude taken up toy the UnitedStates Government had &quot;been much less precise.    We were endeavouring to get the United States Government to clarify.their attitude.The Foreign Secretary said that he trusted thatwe should not reach a &quot;breaking point in the negotiations.Sir George Sansom, who was at present in this country,thought that the Japanese Government wished to reach agreement with us tout were anxious to obtain as favourablea bargain as possible.    The Japanese Press had showed great anxiety lest the conversations should fail and the JapaneseGovernment were greatly puz-zled by the United States actionin denouncing their Commercial Treaty with Japan.    We hadnot yet taken full advantage of the Japanese reaction tothe United States move.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that, putting together all these considerations, hewas disposed to adopt a stiffer attitude towards theJapanese Government on the ground of the anti-Britishdemonstrations which were taking place.    He read out an extract from Telegram No.  438 to Tokyo, which had been dispatched the previous evening, instructing Sir robert craigie to make a strong protest in regard to thesedemon strations.The Foreign Secretary said that Sir robert craigie&apos;s attitude in regard tp the anti-Britishagitation   was, perhaps, somewhat different.His view, broadly, was that if we could reach asettlement with the Japanese, the anti-Britishagitation would stop.    Sir Robert Craigie had

received a-message through an intermediary to the effectthat the Japanese Government had been offended toy themanner in which the American Commercial Treaty had beendenounced, and urged us not to adopt a similar course(Telegram No, 906 from Tokyo).The Foreign Secretary said that he would beglad to have the authority of the cabinet , if thesituation demanded it, to say to the JapaneseGovernment that it was impossible to continueconversations while the anti-British demonstrationscontinued and to suspend the conversations for a fewdays.The Foreign Secretary also thought that, if a situation arose in which it was necessary to take action against the Japanese Government, our wisestcourse would be to denounce our Commercial Treaty with japan.     Such a course was much less likely to involve us in trouble than an embargo and, as twelve monthsnotice was required, it allowed plenty of time in which to manoeuvre.In discussion, reference was made to the recent telegrams and conversations regarding the granting offurther commercial credits to China.The Foreign Secretary said he thought that perhaps telegram No. 884 of 29th July from Sir RobertGraigie on this subject did not give a fair picture of the position.     Negotiations with regard to thiscredit had been continuing since February and thematter had been the subject of repeated Questions andAnswers in Parliament.     It was impossible to believethat the Japanese were not fully aware of the position.He had had a very frank discussion on the matter withthe Chinese Ambassador, and had told him that if we reached the conclusion that it would be embarrassing- 6 -

Hi  ) Lito our Ambassador in Tokyo if we announced thegrant of further credits to China, we should inform the Chinese Government of the fact and thatwe favoured a short delay in the signing of theactual agreement.   In discussion it was emphasised that the essential point was that the ChineseGovernment should realise that we were notintending   to withdraw the offers of furthercredits which we had made to them hut only had inmind a short postponement for tactical reasons-THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was a gooddeal concerned with the anti-British agitation whichit was   difficult to pass over without talcingsome action.    Incidentally, he pointed out that ifthe Tokyo Conversations were suspended or postponedit might not be easy to get them started again.He also stressed that the utmost consideration should be given to Sir Robert Craigie.    our ambassador in Tokyo was working under most difficult conditions and had very few cards in his hand, buthe had shown great skill and. coolness.    It was clear,therefore, that before any decision was taken whichmight have the effect of breaking or suspending thenegotiations, Sir Robert&apos;s views should be ascertainedand due weight given to them.The Prime Minister referred to the question raised by the Foreign Secretary, namely, &quot;if a break in the negotiations was inevitable what wouldbe the best ground on which to break?&quot;   He had thoughtthat the Foreign Secretary would say that it was better to break on the currency issue than on help for China.   He was not quite sure that he appreciatedwhere the dividing line came between help to Chinaand support of her currency.- 7 -

The Prime Minister thought that if we hadto choose between a break on -(a) the prohibition of the use offapi in the Tientsin Concession, and-(b) the grant of a further sum to supportthe Chinese currency (or perhaps thegrant of additional export credits),he thought that (a) was the better ground.    It was preferable to break on international grounds ratherthan on grounds of national interests.   Further,the fapi question was one in which other countriesbesides ourselves were concerned, whereas further help to the Chinese currency would be action takenby ourselves, in which other countries would not participate,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed that it wasimpossible to draw a clear line between the currency question and help to China.    On the otherhand, we had repeatedly stated that the steps whichwe had taken to support the Chinese currency hadbeen taken in our own interests;    he was not anxious,therefore, that a break, if it was inevitable,should come on grounds connected with the Chinesecurrency.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE saidthat the action which the Japanese Government wereurging us to take in banning the use of fapi in theTientsin Concession might be regarded as a breach of neutrality.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that hewas sure that opinion in India would be far morewilling to join in economic sanctions against japan, if such action was based on broad moral

gyormds rnthe,v than^ on th.e-ja&amp;e-&quot;i^io. jaro-tect. Britishinterests in the Fa**-J3a&amp;t.    Such a course would, boConsistent with the statements we had made, that japan had riolated her Treaty obligations to China.The Secretary of State paid a tribute toSi^ Robert Craigie&apos;s balance of judgment underextreme provocation.The Secretary of State for India added that he strongly approved the telegram which had been sent tosir Robert Craigie the previous night (No. 438 toTokyo).   He felt sure that in the last resort theJapanese Government would only attach importance to^force or threats of force.    He did not think thatthe anti-British agitation in China would stop until we took a somewhat firmer line.Reference was made to the protest which theJapanese GoTsernment had made in regard to the treat-ment of Japanese fishermen at Singapore.In reply to questions, THE-FOREIGN secretary said that the line he had taken in this matter wasthat while defence considerations came first, he hoped that it would be possible for something to bedone to prevent individual cases of hardship.    He had informed the Japanese Ambajgysador that, while he didnot intend to link the events at Singapore with those at Tientsin, nevertheless if the Japanese wouldalleviate the situation at Tientsin,this would be ofassistance in regard to the disconnected events at singapore.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR referred to the weakness of our defence position in the Far East, and asked what sanction we could apply if there was a breakdown in the negotiations.

: 285 jTHE SECRETARY OF STA&apos;JE FOn aaia that we might he drifting into the position., which theChiefs of Staff had advised we should at all costsavoid, in which we might he opposed at the same timeto the forces of Germany, Italy and Japan.     He thoughlthat it would he difficult for the Government to takea different line from that suggested by our ambassador in Tokyo, who was conducting the negotiations sosuccessfully.      In any event there should be no breakin the negotiations unless the Cabinet were given anopportunity to consider the situation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he was fully conscious of the defensive sideof the situation and would exhaust every device toprevent a breakdown of the negotiations.  Nevertheless,he felt that the right course might be that we should at this stage put some pressure on Japan to adopta more conciliatory attitude.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said thathe thought there was agreement between Ministers onthe general line to be pursued.      The immediate point at issue was whether, if we were to adopt a slightlystronger line at the present time, the JapaneseGovernment would adopt a more reasonable attitude in the negotiations.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND reminded the Foreign Secretary that the Japanese Ambassador had assured him that the Japanese Government were anxiousto stop the anti-British agitation.     He suggestedthat the Foreign Secretary should see the japanese ambassador and inform him that the British Governmentand the House of Commons were getting restive asa*   result of this agitation^  

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS undey-took to consider this suggestion,THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRaDE drew attentionto the latest telegram from Sir Robert Graigie inregard to export credits for China (TelegramNo. 912 fan Tokyo).Sir Robert now thought that if the Japanese Governmentsaw prospects of getting satisfaction on the Silverquestion,they would not make difficulties in regardtq the grant of export credits to China.THE LORD CHANCELLOR referred to the four menWhom the Japanese Government were asking should be handed over to them by the authorities of the BritishConcession at Tientsin.      He was anxious, if it was\possible, that he should take his share of responsibilityfor finding a solution of this difficulty.     Hesuggested that a statement might be made on the following lines:-&quot;The information which we have received from our people establishes, in our opinion,that prima facie evidence has been produced by the Japanese which, according to our legal obligations in the Concession, require usto hand over two men to the local ChineseCourt for trial on a charge of murder, andas regards two men to hand them over ona charge of being members of an illegal gang.&quot;The Lord Chancellor said that he thought itwas of the utmost importance that, if we reached aposition in this matter when we were prepared to actOh these lines, we should not let it appear that weWere yielding to pressure but should make it plain that our decision was a considered decision taken on thefacts.     He suggested that it might be desirable thatthis question should be considered by him in  conjunctionWith the Law Officers, and that, if this course wasconsidered wise, a statement on the lines of that suggested should be made in the name of himself andthe Law Officers.

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed. J;hat if an announcement on this matter became necessary, it would require very careful handling.     He thought it would he useful thatthe Foreign Secretary should he armed with a joint state-ment by the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers for use,should occasion arise, and he invited the Lord chancellor to consult with the Law Officers, as suggested.This course was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, as a situation might arise which made further actionon our part necessary, he would be glad if the cabinet would authorise the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the President of the Board of Trade, theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs and himself, actingtogether, to denounce our Commercial Treaty with Japan,without further reference to the Cabinet.In discussion it was asked whether this was likelyto precipitate a crisis.     The view was expressed that this &quot;was the least dangerous course open to us if we wished totake some action.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the statement in telegram No. 906 from Tokyo from which it appeared thatthe Japanese Government were quite prepared for denunciation^Of the Treaty on our part.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thathe would be glad if the Colonial Office could be kept intouch if it was proposed to denounce the Treaty, since itwould be desirable to warn the Governors of certain ColottLesof what was proposed.This course was agreed to.The Cabinet:-(l)   took note of the statement of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affeirs.(2)    invited the Lord Chancellor in consultation withthe Law Officers to prepare a joint statement in regard to the four Chinamen the surrender ofwhom was demanded by the Japanese authorities at Tientsin:

(3) authorised the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Trade,to denounce the Anglo-JapaneseCommercial Treaty without further reference to the Cabinet,if thecourse of the negotiations at Tokyoshould render this step desirable.
II
THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat,owing to pressure of work,he had not been ableto circulate a Memorandum on this mattere For sometime past he and his advisers in the Colonial office had been framing proposals for reforming themachinery for the consideration/of Colonial policy.One suggestion made in this connection had been the setting up of a Parliamentary Committee to keep inmeantime, independently of this examination, proposals had been put forward by a number of Members ofParliament, and had attracted a good deal of support,for the setting up of a Parliamentary Committee for colonial Affairs.     On merits, the Colonial secretary was satisfied that the est ablishment of such a parliamentary Committee was desirable and would be helpful.     He was responsible to Parliament for theadministration of soi;ie 50 territories.     At the presenttime, however. Parliament discharged this responsibilityvery lightly.      Indeed,the activities of parliament in regard to Colonial matters ware mainly confined to one or two debates on Supply Days and to parliamentary questions.     Further, the interest displayed byParliament in Colonial matters tended to be concentratedonly on matters which were in need of reform.There was no opportunity in the present system todraw attention to the many.things in our colonial administration which reflected credit upon us.touch with matters of C

The result was that a distorted and unfavourable viewof Colonial administration was presented to the public.Continuing, the Colonial Secretary said thathe thought that, as Parliament was now talcing a newinterest in Colonial&apos; matters,  it was desirable thatthis interest should be encouraged to take a morehelpful and useful form.     It was not practicable to have frequent Parliamentary debates on Colonialmatters, nor were debates the best way of dealingwith the problems involved.     lie therefore favoured the establishment of some form of parliamentary committee.     The result would be to add to the interestin. and knowledge of, Colonial matters among Membersof Parliament, and to provide a more balanced view ofthe present state of our Colonies.     He thought, too,that a Committee which  e*ek^-thre&apos; initiative in makingsuggestions, would be helpful to the holder of his office, having regard to the very wide field coveredby Colonial administration.     Finally, the colonial secretary thought that the establishment of such aCommittee would have a good effect in the Colonies.There remained the question whether theestablishment of such a Committee would afford a precedent for a Parliamentary Committee to dealwith other matters.      It was clear that we did not want to see a Parliamentary Committee system on theFrench model talcing root in this country.     Hethought, however, that the reasons which led him to urge the setting up of a Parliamentary Committeefor Colonial Affairs did not apply in regard to, say,India, Foreign Affairs or the Dominions.

The Secretary of State said that anumber of points would have to be carefully considered, such as, for example, the terms ofreference, methods of procedure and composition of the Committee.     He would have preferred to havefully explored these matters before making an announcement in the House.     /j?ov example,he would have liked Members of both houses to be eligible for membership of the Committee butthis would involve setting up a joint Committee,the procedure of which would have to follow thatof the House of Lords Committees.     this meant conferring very considerable   powerson the Chairman and might be resented by the commons Members of the Committee.     It thereforeappeared undesirable to set up a joint Committeeof both Houses at the present stage.     He thought,however, that this difficulty was one which couldbe got round^Since, however, agitation had arisen in Parliament   for the setting up of a parliamentary committee, he thou, ht that the right coursewould be to make an announcement before the holidays to the effect that the Government accepted,in principle, the idea of a Parliamentary Committeefor Colonial Affairs.

The Colonial Secretary said thathe had mentioned the matter to the PrimeMinister who had asked for further   time forconsideration.     He had also discussed thematter with the Chief Whip who at first wasattracted by the idea, hut on second thoughtshad felt some doubts as to the wisdom ofmaking an announcement before the proposed scheme had been more fully worked out.In reply to a question, theSecretary of State for the Colonies said he thought that the Committee would meet in private and that while some of its evidencewould be made public, evidence on moreconfidential matters would not be published.If a Committee of the House of Commons were contemplated, it would be set up by theresolution of the House of Commons.     If ajoint Committee of both Houses was set upthe machinery would be by resolutions ofboth Houses.- 17

In the course of discussion, the view was expressed that it was unwise to commit theGovernment to accept a Parliamentary Committeefor Colonial Affairs until a scheme had beenfully worked out.      In particular,  it was feltthat if a Parliamentary Committee was set upfor Colonial Affairs, it would be difficult tosee on what grounds a Parliamentary committee could successfully be refused for other subjects,as, for example, Foreign Affairs.      If a parliamentary Committee for Colonial Affairs had existed two years ago, when strong Parliamentarypressure was in progress for d.defence programmes,it would, it was suggested., have been difficultto refuse a Parliamentary Committee for defence.It was also suggested that the Committeev/ould give rise to difficult ruestions ofprocedure.     For instance, would the Secretary ofState appear before the Committee and be as icedquestions of policy?     Again, would, not grave difficulties arise for the Treasury in regard tothe demands for increased expenditure which wouldresult from the Committee*s deliberations       Inregard to the Colonial secretary point that theinterest now shown in our Colonies tended toemphasise the weak sides, this was   inherent in our Parliamentary system.     It wasalso pointed out that in the eyes of the publica Parliamentary Committee would be invested with considerable responsibility; but in reality it wouldhave no responsibility.    The result would no doubt be that the Parliamentary Committee would tend to

press for expenditure in all directions so as toavoid any possibility that blame might be attached,to them,THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was perhaps significant that the parliamentary questions asked on this matter- all referred to a standing Parliamentary Committee or a PermanentCommittee.     He thought that at the present time it would not be wise to go so far as the Secretaryof State for the Colonies proposed without furtherconsideration or experiment.     He was thinkingin terms of setting up a Committee of Membersof Parliament (meetings of which could be attended by peers) which would have no authority from Parliament and no specific rights.     TheSecretary of State would, however, undertake to appear before the Committee at intervals - andGovernors of Colonies on leave,  and perhapssenior Civil Servants, might also appear on occasions.     Such a Committee would afford theColonial Secretary an opportunity of educatingMembers of Parliament in Colonia.1 Affairs but should not give rise to demands which might proveawkward.     Further, such a Committee would not afford precedent for the establishment of a standing Committee on Foreign Affairs or on India.The Prime Minister then read out adraft reply which he had prepared to three questions down for answer on this matter that afternoon,     Various suggestions were madein regard to the draft reply.      It was agreed thatthe general ten our of the reply should   not commit the Government to acceptance or refusal of

the institution of a Parliamentary Committee  os*Colonial Affairs;   hut to say that the G-OYemmeKfjwere consideriaig what was the best method ofgiving Members of Parliament, who were anxious to devote themselves to Colonial matters, a betteropportunity of acquainting themselves with Colonialproblems.The Cabinet agreed to postpone adecision on the proposed formationof a Parliamentary Committee for colonial Affairs,  and to leave for decision by the Prime Minister the terras of the reply to be given tothe three Questions on this subject for answer in the House that afternoon.

ThePresident recalled that, in accordance with theConclusion noted in the margin, the then Secretary for mines had announced in the House of Commons, on1st February, that the Government accepted the Reportof the Royal Commission on Safety in Mines in its general sense and purport, and would begin immediately to take the necessary steps towards implementing it;but that he was afraid it would not be possible to havethe Bill ready for introduction dux^ing the current session,Although the Bill had not been definitelypromised for the following Session, there was a general expectation in the industry that it would be introducedthen, and, if this expectation were not fulfilled,there would be severe criticism both from the MineWorkers&apos; Association and the Miners&apos; M.P&apos;s particularlyin view of the continued heavy accident rate.      It wasnot expected that the Second Reading would be opposed;but, owing to the dimensions of the Bill and its technical nature, the Committee Stage would necessarily take a considerable time;    and, in order to secure   its passage, it would be necessary for the Bill to beintroduced quite early in the new Session.     TheDepartmental work preliminary to a first draft of the&quot;Bill had been completed, but Parliamentary Counsel,who were working under exceptionally heavy pressure hadnot been able to begin   work on the Bill.The President therefore asked that authority might be given for the drafting of the Safety in Mines&quot;Bill to be undertaken by the Parliamentary draftsmenwhen they had disposed of emergency legislation, and

after the holidays, with a view to its considerationby the Committee of Home Affairs.    This authority wasnot sought in order to gain any special priority forthe Bill, but solely in order that the Bill might heready for introduction early in the new Session, shouldthe Cabinet desire to include Safety in Mineslegislation in the King8 s Speech.The Cabinet gave the President the authorityasked for.

7.    The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the President of the Board of Education(CP. 163 (39)) asking for a decision by hiscolleagues on the institution of a National Badge for physical proficiency - in advance of consideration, ofa Memorandum he had prepared on the subject of future policy for the promotion of physical training and recreation in England and Wales.The need for a National Badge Scheme on a voluntary basis in this country had been urged from many quarters, and the President believed that the incentive to training which it would provide would do much to raise the standard of physical fitness,particularly in youth.      His special reason for asking for a decision on this aspect of his proposals as amatter of urgency, was that the Army Sports control board, who had examined the Scheme in detail, were anxious to make the winning of the Badge the main objective of physical training in the new Militia.A Handbook for issue to Militiamen, which includeddetails of the Badge, was already in proof, and itsissue was being held up pending a decision on thequestion of principle.      So far as the present financial year was concerned, any expenses inconnection with the adoption of such a scheme could bemet out of Subhead L. of the Vote of his Department.Thereafter, it was estimated that  15,000 a year would cover the cost of organising and administering the Scheme.

THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION saidthat the badge proposed was intended to set a standardwhich should be capable of attainment by all young people who took up the physical fitness movement seriously.He had reached the conclusion that the National Badge scheme would provide an important incentive.Since the Memorandum had been circulated to theCabinet, however, the Secretary of State for Scotland had informed him that the Scottish Fitness Council entertainedsome doubts as to the wisdom, of adopting the badge.   As hethought it was desirable that England and Scotland should work on the same lines in this matter, he was not thereforeasking for an immediate decision.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that theScottish Fitness Council were some months ago rather averseto the idea of a National Badge.    In particular this view washeld by the Labour Members of the Council.    On the previous day they had again considered the matter on learning of thepresent proposal and had expressed a wish for full consultationwith the English Council before reaching a decision.   Hewould, therefore, like an opportunity to discuss the matter with the President of the Board of Education.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that the ScottishTrades Union Congress took the view that men who obtained the badge would get preference in employment.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION expressedthe hope that the Secretary of State for War would, ifpossible, defer adopting the system for the Militia as itwas desirable $hat it should not seem to originate from $military sources.The Cabinet agreed:-. J - &apos;\To defer a decision on the proposed national Badge Scheme.

TM INDIANFEDERATION.Negotiationswith the(Indian states as to theTerms of theirAccession.(previous reference:Cabinet 35 (38)Conclusion 5.)8c The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (CP. 169 (39))containing an account of developments since theproposed terms for the accession of the Indian states to Federation were communicated by the Viceroy onthe 27th January, 1938, to all Rulers eligible to accede, in accordance with the Conclusion of theCabinet referred to in the margin, together withcertain proposals with regard to future policy onwhich the Viceroy and the Secretary of State were agreed.The proposed terms of accession had evokedconsiderable criticism from the Princes and,  inparticular, the Nizam of Hyderabad had alreadyintimated his unwillingness to accede on the terms proposed.      There was also likely to be considerable criticism from British India when the proposed termsof accession were published, on the ground that theywere over-generous to the Princes and did not providefor Federation on a basis of equal distribution of obligations as between the Provinces and the States. Therewas some   reason to hope, however, that the Princesmight revise their first impressions of the Federaloffer before 1st September, 1939, the date on which their replies to the Viceroy&apos;s communication were due,and that the opposition to Federation in british india would thereby also be reduced.The Viceroy and the Secretary of Statewere agreed that the existing situation did not call for any immediate revision of policy.     An undertakinghad been given to Parliament that a White Paper wouldbe laid on the subject after the Princes&apos; replies hadbeen received but It was felt that this Paper   shouldnot be laid until time had been given for a coolconsideration of the collective opinions of the States,- 25 -

and possibly for some further discussions with Rulers,should they desire thensTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that he wassorry to have circulated such a lengthy Memorandum to hiscolleagues.    He thought, however, that the Cabinet shouldbe aware of the position,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS said thathe was somewhat apprehensive as to paragraph   7 of theReport, in which it was stated that it would be misleadingto renew, in the terms used in previous reigns,theunqualified assurance that the rights of States were&quot;inviolable and inviolate.&quot; Was this altogether consistent with previous declarations of Government?   As regardsthe prospects of Federation generally, he thought thatthe Princes would only be brought into the federation as the result of either fear or coaxing.   He thoughtit would be desirable to avoid a direct issue withthe Princes over Federation, and to allow time toplay its part.THE SECRETARY OF ST^TS FOR india pointed outthat the Memorandum was, of course, prepared for the secret information of the Cabinet.     The precise termsof the statement made in regard to States1 rights was set out in Annexure 4 to CP.  169 (39).    In this statement the position had been made quite clear to the Princes.It was inevitable that^ if the Princes came into Federation,gome of the existing Treaties - made in some instancesas long as a century ago-^oould not be maintained in-definitely.   As regards the statement of the conferenceof Princes and Ministers assembled at Bombay, quoted inparagraph 3 of  -his Memorandum, he had no doubt that thiswas drafted with the intention of obtaining concessions from His Majesty&apos;c Government.

TEDS SECRETARY OP ST-TE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathis only co-irnent was that he did not perhaps take sodispassionate a view of the possibility of a breakdownon the Federation issue.   He thought that it was very desirable to avoid such a breakdown in the near future andthat every reasonable concession should be made to thisend.   He had always thought that the Princes would be induced to enter Federation by coaxing rather than by fear.He drew attention to the words of the Nizam of Hyderabadquoted on page 19 of CP. 169 (39) beginning &quot;the officials who administer my laws are my servants.........&quot;He thought that this point of view had much support and asked whether it would be possible to allow the officials of the Princes to perform certain functions for a periodof years notwithstanding that such functions were outsidethe scope of their duties as defined in the Federationscheme.THE SECRETARY OF STiiTS FOR INDIA said that the princes had been given an opportunity of administeringcertain Federal arrangements through their own officers to the same extent as the Provinces.    He thought it was difficult to put the Princes on a different basis fromthe Provinces in this matter.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was most anxious that a direct issue should not arise on Federation thatAutumntaad-would, be- prepare-r-ed to ooa^mplato oufos-tant-iajr-eo+xce-ssiono to a-v-oid thio happening.     At the oamo ti-me^Concessions must not be made which would arouse ^e*Ae*b*epg^s-itiQHs. from British India.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR INDIA said that he hadno intention of allowing a crisis in the matter of the

f Issue of Federation to be precipitated in the immediatefuture, even if the Princes declined the offer which wehad made.    If this happened, the Viceroy proposed tohave discussions with individual Princes and leaders ofpublic opinion in India.    These discussions would last for some considerable time.The Cabinet took note of the Secretaryof State for India&apos;s Memorandum(CP.  169 (39)).

9.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP. 162(39)),circulating for the information of his colleagues aReport by the Advisory Committee on Trade questions in Time of War, on the subject of Economic Measuresto restrain Japan from further action inimical toBritish interests in the Par East (CI.D. Paper No,1575-B), together with the relevant extract from thedraft Minutes of the 370th Meeting of the Committee 9fImperial Defence (Minute l).In his Note the Minister stated that theCommittee of Imperial Defence had taken note of theConclusions of the above Report, and had agreed thatthe Report, together with the Minutes of the discussion,should be forwarded to the Cabinet for information.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs raised the question whether copies of the report should be sent to the Dominions and to the Governmentof India, in order that they might study the matter.He also thought that it might be useful to convey the gist of it to the United States Government and to theFrench Government.In the discussion which ensued it waspointed out that no decisions had been reached on theReport by Ministers.     The Paper therefore representedno more than an examination on certain lines of whateconomic measures could be adopted to restrain japan from further action inimical to British interests,and tried to anticipate the results of these measures.The view was expressed that if we were to communicate the gist of the Report to the French Government orthe United States Government before we had arrived at  any decisions ourselves on the matter, the result wasnot likely to be helpful and might lead to difficulties

oarIt was pointed out by THE MINISTER OP HEALTHthat the India Office had been represented on theCommittee, and that the views of the Government of india were stated in paragraph 29 of the Report.After discussion it was agreed:(l)    That copies of the Report should besent to the Governments of theDominions and of India for their information only, with an explanationthat no decisions had been reached onthe Conclusions of the Committee andthat we were not at the present timeasking for the views of the Governmentsof the Dominions and of India on thematter:(2)    That the gist of the Report should notbe communicated to the French and united States Governments.

RESPONSIBILITYPOR NATIONALSERVICE.(previous reference cabinet 51(38), Con-clusion lX. )12.    THE CHANCELLOR OP THE D-U-CHY GJ? LANCASTER -reminded his colleagues that when the Lord Privy Sealwas appointed, he assumed immediate responsibilityfor determining, in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, the arrangements to be made for NationalVoluntary Service (See CP. 243 (38)).    The recruitingcampaign had been conducted by the Minister ofLabour, but the Lord Privy Seal had remainedresponsible for general policy.    Now that theco-ordinated appeal for all the Defence Services hadfulfilled its task,  it was proposed that centralNational Service publicity should cease, and thateffort should be concentrated on individual campaignsfor particular localities and particular services in which deficiencies needed to be made good.    that position having been reached,  it was thought thatthe moment had come to relieve the Lord Privy Sealof general responsibility for National Servicepolicy, leaving him with responsibility for theCivil Defence Services only.   Each Minister would carry out the recruiting campaign for his ownService,and any necessary co-ordinating work wouldbe done by the two Man-Power Committees of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, of which he (theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster) was Chairman.This matter had been considered at a Meeting of theMan-Power (Policy) Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence on the previous day and the scheme outlined above had been approved by the ministers concerned.    He thought, however, that as this involved altering an arrangement made by the Cabinetin the previous Autumn, his colleagues should be aware of it.The Cabinet took note of this statement and approved the arrangements proposed.- 33 -

-ARRANGEIffiJNTST*OR the recess.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(39), Con-clusion 1.)13. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, provided theGovernment carried their Motion that afternoon,arrangements would he made for the House of commons to re-assemble on the 3rd October.     power would, ofcourse, be taken to recall the House earlier in caseof necessity.The Prime Minister said that he thought heshould give his colleagues certain information as tohis own movements.     Early in the following week he was going to the North of Scotland, but he would be able toreturn to London, if necessary, in a few hours.     If allwas well, he intended to stay there until the night ofthe 21st August, when he would return to London for aday or so.     He thought it was probable that he would invite those members of the Cabinet who were withineasy reach of London to attend a Meeting of ministers on August 22nd.     Unless, however, there was some specialreason, he did not propose to invite those members of theCabinet who were at a great distance from London toattend a Meeting on that date.His movements thereafter depended on the stateof affairs.     If all was well, he proposed to returnto Scotland and to remain there until some date inSeptember.     He would communicate to his colleagues as soon as possible the date in September when normalweekly Meetings of the Cabinet would be resumed.The Prime Minister expressed the hope that, all his colleagues would have a really good holiday.In saying this he was also thinking of the CivilService, which had worked under exceptional pressure for a very long time.     It was of the utmost importance

that Civil Servants should also have a good holiday, sothat they could return with renewed energy.The Cabinet took note of. this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.2nd August, 1939.
