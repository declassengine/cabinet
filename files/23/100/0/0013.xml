THE INTER- 1.      THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleaguesNATIONALSITUATION.    that It had been arranged that Parliament should meet again on Thursday, 31st August, but that power hadRe-call ofParliament, been retained to recall Parliament earlier if(Preyious     necessary.    On the previous day he had seenReference:Cabinet 42 Mr. Greenwood and had suggested that Parliament should(39), Con-clusion 7.) meet on Wednesday, 30th August.    Mr. Greenwood hadconcurred in this suggestion.    In view,^however, ofthe further mobilisation measures adopted by thePolish Government, and of various rumours which were now current,&apos; the Prime Minister said that he nowthought that it would be desirable that parliament should meet on Tuesday, 29th August,    He very muchhoped, however, that it would be possible to avoid anall-day&apos;meeting.    He had therefore instructed theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury to see thetwo Opposition Leaders and to endeavour to arrangematters so that the proceedings in the House ofCommons should consist of a statement by the PrimeMinister, followed by short commentaries by theLeaders&apos; of the two main Opposition Parties,1 to befollowed immediately by the adjournment of the House.Both the Opposition Leaders had said that in their view this procedure was appropriate.    It was, of course,doubtful how far all their followers would agree tothis course.General agreement was expressed with thisproposal.    It was felt that a meeting of parliament on Tuesday would, give rise to less difficulty than ifthe meeting was postponed until a later date.    The

view was also expressed that it would he undesirable to have recourse to the Closure in order to shortendiscussion in the House of Commons.    It was feltthat the influence of the Speaker would he the most effective means of dealing with this matter.The Prime Minister said that it would, ofcourse, he impossible for him to give to Parliamentanything more than an outline of Herr Hitler&apos;communication and\pf the Government&apos;s reply.    sir nevile Henderson was authorised to give a verbalassurance to Herr Hitler that this procedure would befollowed.    It was suggested that it might also bedesirable that a telegram to the same effect should besent as soon as possible to Berlin.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY mentioned that it would be convenient that the House of lords should meet at 3.0 p.m.  on the following day.The Cabinet agreed to the Prime Minister&apos;suggestion that both Houses of parliament should be summoned to meet on Tuesday,29th August.

jHB INTER-.SITUATION.Danzig andGermany.l(Previous^Reference:Cabinet 44 (39))Attitude of theFrench Government,2. &apos;    THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs gave the Cabinet the latest information in regard io*the international situation.    Some of this information jis recorded on the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofCabinet Conclusions^The Foreign Secretary said that late onthe previous night a telegram had been receivedfrom Sir Eric Phipps saying that, although the needfor speed was recognised, the French Government were anxious to be informed in advance of the nature ofour reply to Herr Hitler.     Accordingly, the foreign secretary said that he had seen M. Corbin earlythat morning and had shown him the draft reply.He had explained that the draft had not yet beenapproved by the Cabinet, but that he did not anticipate substantial alterations.     He had agreedthat M. Corbin might take notes of the reply andmight communicate the substance of it to the FrenchGovernment, in strict confidence and in paraphrase.In reply to a question by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, THE PRIME MINISTER- saidthat we had had no prior knowledge of the letter which M. Daladier had addressed to Herr /Hitler, orof Herr Hitler&apos;s reply thereto.The Prime Minister also warned hiscolleagues against accepting as accurate the statements appearing in the newspapers as to the precise terms of Herr Hitler&apos;s reply to M. Daladier.The   statement attributed to Herr Hitler on thetape-machine was &quot;I have made a demand for Danzigand the Corridor to be returned&quot;.      There might bea considerable difference between this statement and some of the statements which had appeared in theheadlines. _____

IllItaly&apos;s1 position.In reply to a question THE SECRETARY OP STATEPOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that it appeared that the french had intended to keep secret Me Ealadierts letter to herr hitler and Herr Hitler&apos;s jroply, but that publication hadtaken place in Berlin.THE HOME SECRETARY suggested that it might be useful to make another attempt to ascertain, throughSir Percy Loraine, what action Signor Mussolini was taking.     The Home Secretary also drew attention to astatement that Herr von Papen was reported to have madein Turkey to the effect that Italy was not going into thewar and that Turkey should therefore remain neutral.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought themain factor in determining Signor Miiissolini1 s attitude would probably be fear of revolution if Italy was involved in war.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed with the Home Secretary&apos;s suggestion and said that atelegram to Sir Percy Loraine in the sense proposed hadalready been drafted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR asked forinformation as to the statement in the Press that Polandhad carried out general mobilisation.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS readout telegram No0341 from Warsaw to the effect that themeasures taken did not amount to general mobilisation.It was agreed that it would be desirable tosend a telegram to Warsaw in order to make sure that thePolish Government did not allow the impression to be created that they had carried out general mobilisation.Consideration Copies of the revised draft reply to Herr  the draftepiy to        Hitler were then handed round to the Cabinet.Hesr Hitler.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER explained thatdeviouseference:     he had received proposed omerdmente from practically all,abi.net 44(36)) - 4 -IAttitude ofPoland.

l&apos;\ 1Lx X J-of his colleagues, and that these had been very fully considered at a meeting held on the previous evening.The revised draft showed the passages in whichalterations had been made in the text in consequenceOf the amendments received.The following were the main points touched on in discussion.Paragraph 4, International Guarantee.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR made further reference to this matter.     He asked whether the Poleswanted an international guarantee.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had suggested to the Polish Ambassador-some time ago that an international guarantee mightbe a great help in dealing with the Danzig position andthat the Ambassador had nodded his agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had appreciated the Secretary of State for War&apos;s point that we must takecare that we did not enter into an arrangement wherebyPoland would no longer be in a position to afford ushelp on a reciprocal basis.     He thought, however, thatan international guarantee- such as he had in mindpand reciprocal treaty arrangements between this countryand Poland wero not inoompatibleB

bill the statement that &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have noted with satisfaction that thePolish Government have already expressed their readiness to enter into direct discussion with theGerman Government wars based on president roosevelt&apos;s interpretation of the Polish Government&apos;greply to his invitation.It was agreed that it would be necessaryto verify that this statement did not go too far.Paragraph 4: third sentence.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY    said that he was anxious to omit this sentence and to amend the succeeding sentence on the following lines - &quot;Ifsuch a discussion was found possible and led to agreement&quot;.Sevex^al Members of the Cabinet said that theywould like to see the suggestion contained inparagraph 4 for the resumption of direct negotiations between Poland and Germany made more definite..  SIR NEVILE HENDERSON said that when he had suggested to Herr Hitler that .... - should have, direct negotiations with Poland, Herr Hitler had repliedthat he had already made this suggestion and that poland had turned it down.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR suggestedthat it would he desirable that we should offer our good offices in getting direct negotiations startedbetween Germany and Poland if difficulties arose.This would constitute a positive contribution.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADEthought that it would be better to embody thefollowing two points in paragraph 4t   first,that it would be an essential condition of direct negotiations between Poland and Germany that thenegotiations should be.between equals.    Secondly, that,having made the first point, we should be able togo rather further in urging the Poles to agree to direct negotiations.General agreement was expressed with thissuggestion, which the Prime Minister thought had much to commend it.Paragraph 5:    THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR 3C0TLAMHreferred to telegram No. 329 from Warsaw in whichColonel Beck had indicated that he was prepared toput forward the suggestion of an exchange of population,but not directly.   He wished to see a more positivesuggestion made in this paragraph with regard toMinorities.This view was generally accepted.THE PRIME MINISTER added that he thoughtthat M. Beck would be&apos;very unwilling to offer to start direct negotiations with Germany, unless he knew that the offer would be accepted.    His view was that this matter should be dealt with in sucha way that we should first obtain the simultaneous

agreement of both sides for direct negotiation,before either side was asked to make a move.Paragraph 7:    It was agreed that the last sentence of this paragraph (top of page 5) should be omitted, oh the grounds that to introduce a suggestion as to trade would somewhat lower the level of the document.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in his view the communication to Herr Hitler was now a dignified,firm and yet quite unprovocative document.    He thoughtthat th.   communication, supplemented by a verbalaccount nftxich the Ambassador would be in a positionto give, would riieet the situation admirably.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the despatch of the communication to the German Chancellor,subject to the necessary amendmentsbeing made by the Prime Minister andthe&quot;Secretary of State for Foreign,  Affairs to give effect to the abovesuggestions, and to bring the communication into line with anyfurther developments which might take place before Sir Nevile Henderson&apos;left in the course of the afternoon.

It was pointed out that the report hadbeen considered by an Interdepartmental meetingrepresenting the Departments of Government concernedwhich had recommended that, in the first instance,a small number of officers should be sent as quickly as possible to Canada and that from there they should put in hand arrangements for the opening of a purchasingcommission in New York,which could be developed onthe lines suggested in Lord Riverdale&apos;s report.The Minister of Supply recommended that theabove proposal should be approved subject to anycomment from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington,with whom the Foreign Office were understood to bein communication.In his Memorandum (CP, 182(39))the. Chancellor of theExchequer expressed agreement in general with theproposals of the Minister of Supply but drew theattention of his colleagues to the financial problems connected with the question of purchases by GovernmentDepartments in foreign currencies.

Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.,28th August, 1939.In order to ensure that our limited -rescoir-ceswere devoted to the purchases which ranked highestin priority, the Chancellor proposed to set up asmall working Committee on the lines of the TreasuryInter-Service Committee including representativesof the Treasury (with representatives of the Bankof England), the Ministry of Supply and the defence departments and the Pood (Defence Plans) Department,with the following tasks :-(i)    To approve forthwith new proposalsinvolving the expenditure of money in foreign countries by any GovernmentDepartment or, if they are unableto approve, to report to him with recommendations.(ii;    To proceed as speedily as possible,in consultation with the department concerned,  to draw up estimates ofthe requirements in foreign exchangeboth in the immediate future andover a period of three months ahead.In the course of discussion the FIRSTLORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he assumed that theproceedings of the small working Committee, likethose of the present Treasury Inter-service committee, would be reported to all the ministers concerned.This was agreed to.The Cabinet approved the proposals set out in the Memoranda of theMinister of Supply and theChancellor of the Exchequer.
