Turkey.(previous reference:Cabinet 40(39Conclusion 3)1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he ?;as sorry tohave to recall the Cabinet in circumstances whichcould only be described as graven     He asked theForeign Secretary to give an account of theposition.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, while theCabinet would wish to devote most of the time available to considering the situation vis-a-visGermany, it might be convenient that he should explain briefly the position in regard to certain other matters.     He would deal first with Turkey.Since the last meeting of the Cabinet, thedraft of the tripartite Treaty had been agreed withthe French and had been sent to the TurkishGovernment, whose views were awaited.We were also still awaiting the views ofthe Turkish Government in regard to the financialand economic negotiations.     He thought that itwas of the utmost importance that we shoulddespatch to Turkey forthwith whatever warmaterial was available, even if the proper procedurehad not been complied with.     He hoped that theCabinet would be willing to leave this matter tobe settled in consultation between the Treasury andthe Foreign Office, subject to the general principle which he had stated.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER agreed thatred tape must be cut out.     There was, however,one point of difficulty-,.....in regard to which he waswriting to the Foreign Secretary.The&quot; Cabinet agreed to the procedure suggested.THE international situation.

THE INTERNATIONALRuseis*PoliticaljKegotiatione.[(Previous[Reference:[Cabinet 40(59) Con-[elusion l.)Military-Mission.3. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said, that, after discussion with Mr. Strang on his return from Moscow, he had, with the Prime Minister&apos;approval, sent a telegram on 17th August to sir william Seeds containing four alternative formulaedefining &quot;indirect aggression&quot; under Article I ofthe draft Treaty.     He had authorised Sir WilliamSeeds to resume political discussions with M. Molotoffin whatever way he thought best.     Sir William Seedshad reported, however, that he and his Frenchcolleague proposed to await the resumption of theMilitary Conversations before approaching M. Molotoffon these lines.At the outset the Military Conversations had proceeded very amicably.     Rather over a week ago,however, the Soviet Government had enquired whether we could obtain permission from Poland and Roumaniafor Russian forces to operate through those countriesin case of war.     Otherwise, in the Soviet Govern-ment&apos;s view, it would be useless to continue the conversations.      It had been suggested by MarshalVoroshiloff that the British and French governments should approach the Polish and Roumanian governments on this matter.     It had been decided to approach the Polish Government only in the first instance.The Chief of the Polish General Staff had replied to an enquiry from the French that the entry of Russian troops into Poland

would provoke a German declaration of war.She British Ambassador in Warsaw and his military attache&quot; in their turn had approached the Poles, whohad repeated their objections, and had stated thatin their view the Russian objective was to findan excuse to occupy polish territory permanently.Colonel Beck had, however, said that the Polishattitude might be modified if war broke out.Later, the British and French Military Attacheshad again seen the Polish Chief of Staff who,without abandoning his objection to the entry of Soviet troops, had said that the Polish GeneralStaff would be prepared to consider a Memorandumregarding military co-operation with the soviets, based on the Staff Conversations in moscow.     The French Government had apparentlyinterpreted this as authorising them to giveMarshal Voroshiloff an affirmative answer on thequestion of principle, and M. Daladier had instructed the French Mission in Moscow on 21stAugust to comiiiunicate accordingly with MarshalVoroshiloff.     It was not known, however, whether such an answer had actually been given to theISoviet representatives.The Secretary of State for   ForeignAffairs said that he had been asked to authorise -a similar statement;, but had not felt it right todo so.The Foreign Secretary then referred to telegram No.9 from the Military Mission, which stated that the French Government had instructed    General Doumenc to tell the Soviet

Government that Prance&apos;s answer to the Sovietquestion as to right of passage through Polishterritory was &apos; Yes, as soon as Poland is at warwith Germany1 *    He had been asked whether it couldbe assumed that we agreed.    The foreign secretary said that he had not thought it rightto send any answer to this question.   He thoughtthat we should not do so until we knew more aboutthe real meaning of the German negotiations withthe Soviet Government.    Accordingly, a telegram had been despatched to Sir William Seeds that morning instructing him to see M. Molotoff, andto ask the meaning of the negotiations and how we stood in the matter.Reference was then made to telegramNo.8 from the Mission, which the Prime Ministerread out to the Cabinet, according to whichthe Conference was adjourned sine die.     this did not seem altogether consistent with thequestion raised by the Mission in telegram No.9.Reference was also made to telegram No,359from Washington, in which the United states under Secretary of State reported certainconversations between the German ambassador in Moscow and M. Molotoff.In reply to a question, the MINISTER FORCO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE stated that in the courseof the Staff Conversations we had given the SovietGovernment certain secret information as regardsour plans on the Western Front, but only in general terms.    The French had given a good deal more detailed information.-5-

O Oi r\d (0 UTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE HOME affairs suggested that we might &quot;be able to turn, the German-Soviet Pact to good account in connection with ourFar Eastern policy..     He referred in particular tothe statement contained in Telegram No. 359 from washington that M, Molotov thought that theconclusion of an agreement with Germany ought to bemade subject to the cessation of any direct or indirect encouragement of Japanese aggressivetendencies in the Far East,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed^     He thought that the conclusion of the Pactmight also be helpful to us in our dealings with spain.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER ashed whether,if the reports in the Press that a non-aggression pact had been signed were true, our military conversations in Moscow could continue.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, if the Pact of non-aggression meant that-Russia pledged herself to remain neutx-al in a warin which Germany   was involved, it    seemed evidentthat no useful purpose would be served by continuing the military conversations.It was pointed out that, according to thereports from the Russian side, no definite arrangementhad been made and that there might be a good deal

of discussion after Herr Ribtoentrop had reachedlioscow.      It had been reported from one quarter thatthe move was an attempt to force oxxr acceptance o the Russian terms.In reply to a question, the Foreign secretary said that the effect on Poland had been to confirmtheir suspicions of Russia.     It would certainly not make Poland more inclined to accept Russianassistance.     He thought that if it was true thata German-Soviet Pact had been concluded, this was perhapsjmt of very great importance in itself.   Nevertheless,the moral effect of the conclusion of such anagreement at the present time would be very great.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

international situation (Contd. )The Par East.(previous reference cabinet 40 (39)Conclusion 4.)4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that the discussions at Tokyoon purely local Tientsin issues had proceededfairly satisfactorily.      .7e had in effectreached agreement.     The Japanese Governmenthad been informed of our readiness to handover the four men.     Habeas Corpus proceedings9however3 had now been started and the actualtransfer of the men to the Chinese Court hadbeen delayed.On the larger economic issuesswe had informed the Japanese Government thatwe could not conclude a bilateral agreementwith them since other Governments were concerned.The United States Government were pleased withthis reply.     Nevertheless9 he feared thatwe should find ourselves in some difficulty with the Japanese Government.     He had setout the points at issue in his Memorandum onthe Far Eastern Situation (CP. 178 (39)).This paper contained certain suggestions as tothe action wnich we should have to take if theJapanese broke off the negotiations9 orresumed the blockade of the Tientsin concession in an intensified form.      He did not however,ask for any decision on these matters at thepresent stage.The Cabinet took note of this Statement.

THE INTERNATIONALSITUATIONCONTINUED.DANZIG andGERMANY.(previous reference:Cabinet 40(39),Conclusion 2).5. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that the position in regard to the localDanzig disputes was somewhat improved.Herr Burckhardt. the League Commissioners, had seen Herr Hitler on 11th August and had had along discussion with him.    Herr Hitler had nottalked very much about Danzig itself8 but had said a good deal about the unreasonableness of thePoles, and how necessary it.was that germany should have grain and timber.    Herr Hitler hadsin effect, said that he did not want war but thatif war came the responsibility would not be his.On his return Herr Burckhardt had succeeded in settling the disputes about thecustomss and about the margarine factory.    In themeantime9 since about the 12th August j, theGerman Press had become more heated. mainly on the question, of the German minorities in poland.In Telegram No.  368 of 16th AugustSir Nevile Henderson had reported a longconversation with Herr Weizacker.    On the 18thAugust we had sent a telegram to our ambassador in Warsaw (No. 272) in which we had urged him to appeal to Colonel Beck that there should be some discussion with Germany of the minority problem.The Poles had taken this quite wells but it did notappear to have had any very definite results.    it seemed that the minority question was now thecentre of the problem.

Attitude ot The Foreign Secretary referred to the meetingItaly.   our policy to at Salzburg between Herr von Ribbentrop andItaly.Count Ciano.    This meeting was pretty evidently theresult of some indication given by Signor Mussolinito Herr Hitler that he did not want to be draggedinto war.Count Ciano had then seen Hurr Hitler atBerchtesgaden and had been less stiff than he hadbeen with Herr von Ribbentrops because be had been told by Herr Hitierfi according to the reports whichi*j*sr-*L ISS^-Sreached us, that Danzig wws a- luial affair whichwould not occupy much time., and that Italy was onlyasked to maintain a supporting position on the flank.Sir Percy Loraines in his telegrams fromRomes (especially telegrams 628, 629 and 630) had made it clear that there was a strong feeling in Italyagainst being dragged into a war by Germany.    Hethought that Sir Percy Loraine had dealt with theposition admirably.    A telegram had been sent to him onthe 19th August (telegram 526 to Rome) suggesting thathe should send a further message on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to Signor Mussolini.The Foreign Secretary said that this raised afurther point, namely that it was desirable that weshould take an early opportunity of reviewing our policy in regard to Italya in the event of a warbreaking out and of Italy attempting to remain neutral.A telegram had been despatched to Paris in order tomake sure that the French would not take any strong

t5 di 5action against Italy on the outbreak of war which would prejudice the position, and a satisfactory reply tothis telegram had been received.The Cabinet agreed that this matter should be reviewed at an early date by the Committee of ImperialDefence (Defence Plans (Policy)  representation).Proposed The Foreign Secretary said that he had explainedletter to herr Hitler, the line of approach which it was proposed to make tothe head of the Italian G-overnment.    In regard to theGerman government there was a good deal ofinformations, from a number of sources, to the effectthat Germany proposed to attack Poland, and the dates25th to 28th August had been mentioned.    If these wereGermany&apos;s intentions they were probably based on theassumption that if they attacked Poland they would wina speedy victory, and that other Powers would not interfere.   He thought that the Prime Minister would wish to explain what had been proposed in regard to an approach to the head of the German Government.THE Prime MINISTEE said that a good deal ofinformation had been received as to the probableaction of the German Government, and of the steps, whichwe must take if we were to stop them.The Prime Minister referred in particular to telegram No. 430 from Berlin, the second paragraph ofwhich he read to the Cabinet.The two points which arose from the telegram were:-First, should he send a personal letter to herr Hitler?    and secondly, should the letter be taken by aspecial emissary?

The second point was in line with suggestions which had reached us from a number of sources, includingHerr Burckhardt.     It had been suggested that Herr hitler would like to idiscuss the matter with an Englishmanwho could speak German and it had been suggested thata soldier would be acceptable.     As against this other information was to the effect that Herr Hitler fully realised our attitude in regard to Danzig,, and that hewas likely to be only irritated by the continued repetition of our views.The suggestion that General Ironside should actas a special emissary had been considered,,     It was felt, however, that if a letter was to be sent it wouldbe necessary to make some suggestions as to how thedispute could be settled, otherwise than by force.This was likely to lead to some enquiries from herr hitler as to what kind of suggestions we had in mind and it was obviously necessary, therefore, that anyemissary sent should be capable of dealing with verydelicate negotiations *     After consideration of various possibilities he had come to the conclusion thatGeneral Ironside would not be the right emissary in thecircumstances.So far, the Prime Minister continued, hehad dealt with the proposal in the light of thesituation as it existed before the reports of theRussian negotiations with Germany.     According to thereports in the Press, these negotiations had been

carried on, in secrets since as long ago as June last.Whether or not this was the cases it was difficultto reconcile the action of the Russians, instarting these negotiations without saying a wordto us, with good faith on their part.    It was most significant that the negotiations were regarded in3erlin as having removed the danger of war.    Theview was now taken in Germany that it was impossiblefor Great Britain to save Poland, and that weshould make no attempt to fulfil our obligations.The Prime Minister called attention to atelegram from Warsaw (No0284) in which Colonel Beckwas reported as saying that this latestdevelopment had not changed the situationsubstantially.    Its importance lay in whether itaffected the determination of the French.and ourselves to carry out our obligations.The Prime Minister said that, in his view,it was unthinkable that we should not carry out these obligations.    He thought that an announcement should be made on behalf of the Government that evening that, whatever might be the natureof the arrangement made between Germany and russia, it made no difference to our obligations to Poland and to our determination to supportPoland.

Recall of THE PRIME MINISTER also said that heparliament.thought that parliament should he recalled onThursday, and that &quot;both Houses should he invitedto pass the Emergency Powers (Defence) bill through all its stages on that day.     The passageof this Bill would give us power to make thenecessary Regulations, as and when required, but the Regulations would not he made until thesituation demanded.This course was agreed to.THE PRIME MINISTER also thought thatcertain other measures should he taken by way of preliminary steps towards mobilisation.     Hethought that, provided we took these s&quot;oeps, therewas no reason why the proposal to send a personal letter to Herr Hitler should not be carried out.On the other hand, it was clear that the letter couldnot be sent unless the steps which he had indicatedwere first taken.      Otherwise it would be thoughtthat the letter was sent as a result of the reportedagreement between Russia and Germany.      In thesealtered conditions he felt that the letter should be passed through the ordinary diplomatic channels, andnot carried by any special emissary.The Prime Minister then read a draft of theproposed letter to Kerr Hitler.In the discussion which ensued, thefollowing points were made.Who should be informed of the despatch ofthe letter?     The Prime Minister said that his intention was to send a copy to Signor Mussolini, inview of his somewhat special position, and to tell the French and Polish Governments of the action taken.It was suggested that, if copies were sentto other persons, it would make it more difficult-14-

for Herr Hitler to accept the proposals in theletter.     On the other hand, if no communication on the subject was made to Prance or Poland and thefact that we had made a communication became public.we should be accused of going behind their backs andof betraying the Poles.&apos;The question was asked as to what informationit was proposed to give to the H0use of commons on the matter.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that he proposed to tell the Leader of the Opposition, but notto tell the House of Commons until there v/as some public reaction which made this course desirable.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY suggested that itv/as not necessary to do more than to tell the Polesand the French the gist of the message, but that theposition in regard to Signor Mussolini v/as rather more complicated.     A suggestion had been made in telegram No. 326 to Rome that Signor Mussolini might make an approach to Herr Hitler on certain lines.It would be awkward if Signor Mussolini were to make such an approach to Herr Hitler and v/ere then to find that we had communicated directly with Herr Hitlerwithout his knowledge.In further discussion the point was made that the contents of the draft letter to Herr Hitleramounted to little more than a restatement of ourposition.      It v/as suggested that all the Prime Ministerneed say to Parliament on the matter was to restatethe position and to say that we had taken steps tomake sure that the German Government understood ourreaffirmation of the position.

Q&apos; 9&apos; flO i O dThis course was generally approved.The discussion then turned on the time factor.      It was explained that, according to information that had been received;, it was desirablethat the letter should be sent in the course of thenext two or three dayss if it was to serve any useful purpose.      It was proposed to telegraph theletter to Sir Nevile Henderson and to ask him totake it to Herr Hitler on the next day.This in turn led to some discussion whetherit was wise to drop the proposal for a specialemissary.      THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he was disposed to drop the idea of a special emissary,partly on account of the time factor and partly onaccount of the difficultjr of finding a suitableemissary at short notice.In regard to the text of the letter oneor two comments were made and an amendment to thefinal paragraph was agreed to.At a later stage of the Meeting theForeign Secretary said that a telegram had just beenreceived from Mr. Shepherd, our Consul at Danzig(No. 142).     Mr. Shepherd said that he had had a visit from Herr von Schwerin who had come to Danzigat the request of Herr Weizsaeker.      In the latter&apos;opinion, it was most important that we should send a letter by special emissary to Herr Hitler on the23rd or 24th August.

The Foreign Secretary asked the authorityof the Cabinet to vary the conclusions which hadbeen provisionally reached in the light of this further information.This was agreed to.Some further discussion then took placein regard to the advisability of sending a personal letter to Herr Hitler.THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR THE COLONIES^   fk^asked what would be the effect on Herr Hitler ifhe realised that the gist of the letter to himhad been communicated to Signor Mussolini and tothe French and Polish Governments,    Would he not feel that he had been put in a position which made it much more difficult for him to withdraw? ^In the course of the discussion whichensued,  the FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thoughtthat any steps which we took to make our attitudeclear to Herr Hitler were to some extent open tothis objection.    The sending of a personal letterto Herr Hitler had, however, three countervailingadvantages - first, that it contained the element ofa personal appeal; secondly, that it was harderfor Herr Hitler to ignore a letter addressed to himthan to ignore public statements made by representatives of this country, and, thirdly, therewas some advantage in having our statement publiclyon record.THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR THE colonies said that he thought the arguments were evenly balanced and that he did not wish to press thepoint of view which he had mentioned.

The Cabinet agreed:-(i) That Parliament should he summoned to meet onThursday, 24th August.(ii) That both Houses of Parliament should he invited to pass the Emergency Powers(Defence) Bill through all stages on the24th Augusta(iii) That a statement should he issued to the B.B.C.and to the press on the conclusion of themeeting announcing -(a) the decisions recorded under (i) and(ii) above.(b) the general nature of the farther measuresof a precautionary character beingtaken by Departments (see conclusion below)o(c) that the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between the German and soviet governments would not affectHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s obligationto Poland and their determination to fulfil it;and that the drafting of this statement should be left to the Prime Minister inconsultation with a few of his colleagues.(iv) That our policy in regard to Italy in the eventof war breaking out and Italy attempting toremain neutral should be further consideredby the Committee of Imperial Defence (D.P.(f?)Representation) at an early date.(v) To authorise the despatch to Herr Hitler of a personal letter on the lines of the draftread to the Cabinet.(vi) That it be left to the discretion of thePrime Minister and Foreign Secretary todetermine the best method of sending this letter to Herr Hitler.(vii) That the gist, but not the text, of theletter should be communicated to signor mussolini and to the French and PolishGovernments.

6.        Arising out of the discussion on the previousitem, some general discussion took place in regard toour Defence Preparedness.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR thought that thestep which would carry most weight with herr hitler would he general mobilisation.General agreement was expressed with the viewthat it was desirable that we should take a number of measures which, in the aggregate, would create astrong effect.     It was pointed, out that the decisions to recall Parliament and to pass the Emergency Powers(Defence) Bill in one day would create a considerableimpression.     The view was generally expressed, thatit was desirable to make it clear that we were takingmeasures preparatory to mobilisation.     On the otherhand, since no other Power had announced mobilisation,though in fact many of them had mobilised, it was undesirable to put our announcement in such a form asto allow it to be said that we were the first Powerto give effect to general mobilisation.Some discussion ensued as to the procedure tobe adopted, in dealing with the further Defence measuresto be taken.     It was pointed out that the Reportof the Standing Committee on the Co-ordination of departmental action on the Outbreak of V/ar (CP,179 (39)) had been prepared the previous day, beforethe news of Germany&apos;s negotiations with Russia hadbeen received, and the view was expressed, that therecommendations contained, in that Report should be supplemented in a number of directions.

The view was also expressed that it would hedifjficuXt -for the Cabinet to deal in xletail with ellthe. measures which might bf involved, &apos;In this connection., THE MINISTER FOR GC-QRDINATTOITOF DEFENCE explained that the Chiefs of Staff had prepared a Report, dealing with a number -of other measures,, which had not yet been circulated to ministers,-After further discussion the Cabinet decided.&apos; &apos;  ,to deal, immediately with the re commendations set outin the draft Minutes of the Meeting of the Standing/Sub--O.M.-ittoe on the C^-ordination of departmental action on.the Outbreak of War.      The Cabinet went.ihrough this Report item by item.

MOST SECRET.A IV/V  X    CDEFENCE(FINANCE)REGULATIONS.7.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said itwould shortly he essential to take steps in regardto the loss of gold which had been very heavy inthe last few days, amounting on one day to  30millions.    The matter was, of course, one of extremesecrecy, hut he thought it would be necessary to take action within two or three days, since the amount ofgold remaining in the Exchange Equalisation account must now be regarded as the minimum required for our war Chest.    Hitherto we had used the gold in theExchange Equalisation Account to maintain the  at the existing level of $4.68, but it was clearthat we should not be able to do so much longer.Broadly speaking, there were three courses open to us.    The first was to cease to operate theExchange Fund altogether and to allow the   to findits own level:   The second was to cease the operations of the Exchange Fund for the time being until the  dropped to a certain predetermined level and then to resume the operations of the Fund:   The thirdcourse was to introduce measures of Exchange Control.Under either of the first two methods the value ofthe  &apos;could be brought back again if favourable circumstances arose later; but if Exchange Controlswere once introduced it would be a very difficult andlengthy task to remove them later.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked forthe authority of his colleagues:-(1) To change the system under which theBank of England were at presentoperating, namely that the  should be maintained at the levelof $4.68.WO CIRCULATION.CABINET 41 (59)  ITEM 7.

0 4 Qdi 4 o(2) To take any measures already envisaged in the financial sphere to deal withthe currency situation.The Chancellor said that he had beeninformed that afternoon that the position could beheld that day and perhaps also for the ensuingday, but that it would be necessary to review theposition at the latest on the evening of Wednesday,23rd August.    No Act of Parliament was, of course,required to allow the level of the   to drop.    TheCity would, of course, appreciate at once when theExchange Fund ceased to operate.   He thought itwould be necessary that we should endeavour to warn the Government of the United States of America,and he thought that the French should be informed,but not until the very last possible moment.Continuing, the Chancellor said thatif the   were allowed to find its own level, that level would, of course, be substantially lower than04.68.    He was confident, however, that sterling would maintain its own level, once found.The Chancellor added that, if it was found necessary to introduce; Exchange Control (andit would be necessary to introduce control shouldwar come), it was desirable that we should notinstitute control when the   was at too high a level.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADEreferred to the probability that the sterling blocwould follow suit.    He also referred to thepossibility that a drop in the value of sterling atthis stage would be regarded as a sign of weaknesswhich would be encouraging to Germany.
It
The Chancellor agreed that this last point was a difficulty that should be guarded againstas far as possible.    He thought we should take theline that our gold reserves constituted part of ourweapons of war, and that the determining reason why we had decided to stop the operation of the ExchangeFund at this juncture was that we were determined toretain our existing store of gold as a war measure.The Chancellor added that he had great confidence that a strong appeal to holders of sterling to standby sterling would meet with good support.The Cabinet authorised the Chancellor totake action on the lines indicated.
