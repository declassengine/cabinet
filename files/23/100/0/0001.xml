THE INTER-national situation.Rus s ia.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(39), Con-clusion 1*)1.    THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Cabinet woul^ have seen Sir WilliamSeeds&apos;- Telegrams (Hos. 125,  127 and 128 fromfMoscow)giving an account of his discussions with M.Molotov.It appeared that M. Molotov, whose attitude did not seem to be very helpful, took the view that if thedifficulty in regard to the Baltic States could notbe surmounted, the best plan might he that Great Britain,France and the Soviet TTnion should enter into obliga--tions limited to mutual assistance in the event of direct attack by an aggressor on the territory ofone or other of the three Contracting Parties.The Foreign Secretary s8.id that on the previousSaturday a revised formula, which ha.d been agreed with the French Government, had been communicated toSir William. Seeds (^elegrams 140 and 141 to Moscow).Our -Ambassador, however, had reached the conclusionthat it would be wiser not to put this further draftbefore M* Molotov until he (the Secretary o^ State)had had time to consider it in the light of theSoviet Gove^n^ent&apos;s reply (Telegram No. 131 from moscow).    A long telegram, had now been sent to oarAmbassador &apos; Telegram No. 142 to Moscow) setting out our comments on M. Molotov&apos;s aide -memo ire and,explaining the disad.vanta.ges of a. Tripartite treaty between Great. Britain, Prance and Russia, confined to the case of direct, attack by an aggressor on theterritory of one of the three Contracting Parties.It had been left to Sir Jilliam Seeds&apos;  discretion to decide whether to submit the revised draft toM, Molotov or whether he should&quot; invite M, Molotov -to suggest an. alternative dra.ft.

The Foreign Secretary said that, as the resultof reports from Moscow and of an interview which a3oumaiist had had in London with M. Maisky, it had become clear that Russia attached great importanceto the inclusion of a provision against the conclusions-sion by any of the Contracting Parties of a separatearmistice or peace.   This matter had been consideredby the Foreign Policy Committee at their Meetingheld the previous morning, at which, after full consideration, he had been authorised to inform our representatives in Mop cow that if agreement could bereached on all other matters, and this was the onlyoutstanding point, we would be prepared to acceptthe inclusion of a provision on the lines proposedby the Russian Government.    It was, no doubt,  clearthat the inclusion or a provision on these lines was open to certain objections.   Nevertheless, the foreign secretary said that the inclusion of such a proviat*Mtwould not cause him much anxiety.    If, for example,the Russian Government sought to keep this  countryfighting for some fantastic object, common sensewould, he thought, re-assert itself.The Foreign Secretary concluded by saying thai,provided Russia was really keen on reaching an agree-ment, he thought that there were no outstanding points which were likely to give rise to difficulty.   Thefact that M. Molotov had suggested that, as an alter-native, France, Great Britain and Russia should, signa Tripartite Treaty confine^ to the case of direct attack by an aggressor on the territory of one of thethree Contracting Parties, was, he thought, some indication that M. Molotov was not seeking for an excuse to break off the negotiations.

GTHE PRIME MINISTER invited attention to TelegramNo. 256 from Berlin reporting that front-pageprominence had heen given in the German Press ofthe 17th June to a &quot;Deutsches Nachriehten Biiro&quot; message from London claiming to give the true -background, of thenegotiations with the Soviet Union.    This report,which was wholly misleading, said that &quot;the Sovietnegotiators were demanding a bindinp British assur-ance in the event of Soviet. Russia., in fulfillingher obligations in respect of assistance to GreatBritain, becoming involved in a conflict with Japan&quot;The Prime Minister asked wise the r the foreign secretary had taken any steps to deny the accuracy of this report,TEE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the report had been denied in Russia, but he agreed that it would be desirable that we also shouldtake steps to deny it here.The Cabinet took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.-3-

THE INTER- 2.  THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSNATIONALSITUATION (COM&quot;D.)  said that, at their Meeting the previous day, thePoland *(previous reference:Cabinet SI(39)    Con-clusion 2,)Foreign Policy Committee had had before them thedraft of an Agreement with Poland.    This draft was intended to replace the temporary Agreement con-cluded. during Colonel Beck&apos;s visit to London inApril, and was largely based on the summary of conclusions of the Conversations held in London onthe 4th and 6th April between Colonel Beck, thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary (CP. 83( 39)).For the most part, the points ra.ised werematters of drafting, and no important issue ofprinciple was involved.   As regards procedure, itwas intended to discuss the draft with the FrenchGovernment, and, subject to their observations, tosubmit it to the Polish Government, with a view to final settlement of the text in London.The Cabinet took no+e of this statement.

5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs read to his colleagues the latest situationreport received from Tientsin (Telegram No.256).On the 19th June, two telegrams hadbeen despatched to our Ambassador in Japan(Telegrams Nos. 301 and 306 to Tokyo) dealingwith various suggestions which Sir Robert Craigiehad made the previous day (Telegrams Nos9  594and 595 from Tokyo) as to the line of approachvfhich he might adopt with a vie&apos;-r to gettingnegotiations started at Tokyo to relieve thesituation and authorising him to proceed on thelines proposedoThe Foreign Secretary said that a telegram had been received on the 20th June (Telegram No0614    from Tokyo) reporting Mr, Arita.&apos;s reception of Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s suggestion.      TheJapanese Minister for Foreign Affairs said thatthere was a very strong feeling that the matter should be settled locally,,      The foreign secretary also read out telegram No.  620 fromTokyo, a copy of which is incluled in theSecretary&apos;s standard file of Conclusions.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary saidthat he did not think that there was much whichcould be done until we learnt the outcome ofSir Robert Craigie&apos;s approach.      He was hopeful that we should be able to open negotiations in tokyo, or, if not, in Tientsin, but he was afraid that the latter was more likely than theformer,

THE LORD CHANCELLOR suggested that the JapaneseGovernment might hold that a Tribunal of Three which included a representative of the United States Governmentwould be likely to be influenced against them.    He askedwhether there was any way of making the suggestion morepalatable to the Japanese,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that so far as concerned the four men, whose surrender the Japanese Governmentdemanded, he doubted whether we should persuade the JapaneseGovernment to accept the proposed Tribunal of Three, whichthey regarded as a deliberate attempt to bring in someother party who would become embroiled in the dispute.   Hethought that a settlement on this particular point couldonly be reached if we satisfied ourselves that our original decision had been a wrong one and that the right course was now to surrender the men.    In this connection, he (theForeign Secretary) referred to a recent telegram fromTientsin (Telegram No. 214 of 11th June) which suggestedthat Mr. Jamieson had at one stage given the Japaneseauthorities to understand that the date and method ofhanding over the men were questions which would be settled in due course.    In effect, therefore, it seemed possiblethat Mr. Jamieson had promised that the men would be handedover.    The point was not altogether clear, but, if we were satisfied that this was the case, he thought that we mustadmit that we had made a mistake.Discussion ensued as to who should carry on thenegotiations if they took place in Tokyo,    The Cabinetre reminded that Admiral Kelly had played a prominent partin settling the Shanghai troubles.    It was suggested thatthe services of the Admiral in Command of the China Fleet(Vice-Admiral Sir Percy Noble) might be used in thisconnection.wein

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that it hadbeen suggested to him that one reason why the japanese were taking this action was that, if they could get ameasure of control over the British Settlement at tientsin, they would have a much better chance ofestablishing their new currency in North China.    Atthe present time, Chinese dollars were freelyaccepted in the Concession area.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it was clearthat if the currency question were raised, it was not one which could be settled by discussion between theJapanese and British Governments only, nor was it amatter which was susceptible of discussion at Tientsin.Food Supply. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat his Department had invited the Admiralty to examineWhat steps could be taken by our Naval Forces to dealWith the food supply question in Tientsin if it should become serious.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he understood therewere plenty of stored foodstuffs; the shortage related to perishables.    It appeared that the garrison had made an expedition into the neighbourhood and had returnedwith a lorry-load of vegetables^    Judging, however,from the statements made in the Press, the Japanese   -were likely to bring pressure to bear on Chinesefarmers to refuse supplies, and, if so, the shortagemight recur.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatdestroyers could not get up to Tientsin, as they couldnot turn in the river there.    He would take steps tohave the possibilities of naval assistance in the supplyOf foodstuffs examined.

letaliUioavigasures.strategical situation.TEE PRIME MINISTER said that this matter had been examined and a report made to the Foreign Policy Committee.This report indicated that none of the suggestions made would be really effective unless we had the co-operationof the United States of America.    The French concurred- inthis conclusion.    Further, it was no use embarking on apolicy of retaliation unless we were prepared to imposesanctions which would be effective.    If this happened,the Japanese might be stung to retaliate, and it wastherefore wise, before deciding to apply sanctions,toexamine the strategic situation.The Chiefs of Staff had accordingly been invitedto consider the general position and their Beport hadbeen of a discouraging nature.    It seemed clear that our right course was to endeavour to reach a settlement withthe Japanese, rather than to embark on measures of retaliation which might involve us in sending out. a BattleFleet to the Far East at a later date.The Prime Minister referred to an important point which had been brought out in the report made by theChiefs of Staff,namely, that if we decided to embark onsevere retaliatory measures, it would be necessary thatwe should first withdraw the   China   Fleet from theNorthern Chinese ports to some safer place.    We shouldalso have to evacuate the civil population from the concession areas and we should possibly have to abandon anumber of river gunboats and our garrisons in North China.In the view of the Chiefs of Staff it would be a gravemistake to leave vessels of the   China   Fleet in places where they could be blockaded by the Japanese.In the second place, it had been thought rightto consider the situation which would arise if thesituation with Japan became intolerable and strong actionon our part became inevitable.    He had asked the-8-

Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to arrange fora Paper to be prepared, for submission to the defence plans (Policy) Committee, as to the action which weshould take if this situation ,arose.      It was clearthat the situation would have important repercussions on our position in the Eastern Mediterranean.      Itwas clear that the right course was to reach asettlement of the Tientsin dispute, provided that thesettlement was consistent with our honour.     this conclusion was supported by the consideration that,although there was no reason to believe that thepresent episode was inspired by the Germans, it wasimpossible to believe that if we became involved inthe Far East, Germany would not take advantage of thesituation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR referred to thepassage in the Report made by the Chiefs of Staff tothe Foreign Policy Committee (F.P.(36)96), in which reference was made to the degree of assistance in theFar East which we might derive from the RussianGovernment aTHE PRIME MINISTER said that this aspect of thematter would be borne in mind.     He thought, however,that the position of the United States was moreimportant.     It was represented, however, that it wasimpossible for the United States Government to affordus much assistance over the Far Eastern dispute withoutPR.35C^)i. Jeopardising the prospects of the passage of the Billamending their neutrality legislation,,THE MINISTER OF HEALTH mentioned that the AdvisoryCommittee on Trade Questions in Time of War were meeting

on the following day and asked whether it was desirable that the Committee should consider variouspapers which had been referred to them dealing withthe possibility of retaliatory measures against japan.THE PRIME MINISTER thought it was desirablethat the Committee should examine the position.The Cabinet took note of the above statements.

THE international situation (CONTD.)Italian Relations with france.(Previous reference cabinet 31 ( 39),Conclusion 4).4. THE SECRETARY OP STATS&apos; FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said he had no further progress toreport on this matter.     When Sir EricPhipps had been in London recently, he had asked the Prime Minister&apos;s permission to beallowed to handle this matter personally.Sir Eric thought that a short delay of, say. a fortnight might be advisablec     During thatperiod it was hoped that the Turkish and russian pacts would be concluded and theFrench Parliament was expected to rise.Sir Eric J?hipps had also enquired our attitude in regard to italy s Suez Canal claims..     Itwas proposed to reply that our attitude was thesame as what we believed to be the french attitude, namely, that we should make no concessions unless we were convinced of thegood faith of the Italian Government.     Thathowever need not prevent us from discussing the matter with representatives of the ItalianGovernment.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

THE international situation (cent1d).Relations between france and Spain.(Previous reference cabinet 31 (39)Conclusion 6.)5.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that the latest suggestion madeby the French Government had been that theywould surrender the Spanish gold provided theSpanish Government would undertake to acceptthe immediate repatriation of 50,000 of theSpanish refugees now in France and of theremainder (230,000) within three months.This suggestion was not very helpful.As regards the litigation respecting the Spanish securities in this country, theLord Chancellor had written a letter tohim (the Foreign Secretary) promising totake what steps he could to accelerate the hearing of the action.   This letterhad been sent to the Duke of Alba who had expressed his satisfaction.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said he would beglad if the Foreign Secretary would ask the Spanish Ambassador in London to make sure that the plaintiffs solicitors in thecase took all the action which was necess-ary on their part to ensure an early trial of the case.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY took note ofthis request.

THE INT ERNM11ONALSITUATION (contd. )Relations with spain.(Previous reference cabinet 32 (39)Conclusion 6.)6.        THE PRESIDENT OP THE.-BOARD -QF-TKAD1T------asked the Foreign Secretary for his views as to the present attitude of the SpanishGovernment to this country particularly inregard to the negotiations on commercial matters.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said thatthere was some evidence to show thatGeneral Franco wished to keep out of the axis.   He thought that it was desirable - tha-fc--discussions and. negotiations with Spainshould proceedoTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF trade said that a representative who had &quot;beensent to Burgos immediately after theconclusion of the Civil War to deal with negotiations on commercial matters hadbeen somewhat coldly received and it had therefore been decided to leave matters in -suspense for the time being.    He would beglad to get negotiations on commercial matters started as soon as the- prospectswere favourableo

ISH FINANCIALISSION.previous Referenceabinet 32 (39),tem 8.)7. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer said that he had had no detailed conversations with Colonel Koc as to the extent of thefinancial assistance asked for by PolandoHe understood, however, that Colonel Koc&apos;demands amounted to requests for assistancetotalling  60,000,000.     These requests fellunder three heads, first, demands for goods which could be purchased in this country.Provided that the supply could be arranged, he hoped that these demands would not present greatdifficulty.      Secondly, demands for financial help for articles to be purchased abroad.     this involved the provision for Poland by thiscountry of foreign exchange.     Thirdly,financial help to assist Poland to balanceher Budget, or to meet certain domesticobligations and responsibilities as, forexample, to enable her to employ more men in her war factories.     The total of the demandsput forward was formidable and disturbingoThe Cabinet took note of this statement, discussion of which took place under the ensuingitem.     (Conclusion 8, below).- Ik

EXPORT&apos; CREDITS     8. The Cabinet had under consideration aLEGISLATION.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(Previous (CP. 135 (39)), in which he pointed out that under reference:Cabinet 1       Section 4 of the Export Guarantees Act, 1939, the(39), Con-elusion 6.)    aggregate liability at any time in respect of non-,    ,       commercial guarantees given under that section was&quot; 3*6 0*7)/?).    limited to  10 millions, and that at the 41st Meetingof the Foreign Policy Committee it had been agreed to approve in principle a proposal that authority shouldbe sought to increase that limit by an amount to bedetermined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of Trade,,    The immediate needfor legislation arose from decisions to grant non-commercial credits to the amount of  5 millions to roumania, and of substantial sums in other cases, whichentailed commitments far exceeding the present limit.After consultation with the Chancellor of the exchequer the President was satisfied that it was essential toobtain the necessary legislation before the SiiiimerRecess.    The amount of the increase which parliament would be asked to sanction would be dependent on thecourse of discussions which were taking place with thePolish Delegation, and he proposed that the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to decide,  in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on the exactfigure required.    The only other-material provision would be a clause to enable the Treasury to arrangefinance for promissory notes, etc., guaranteed by theDepartment at times when those notes could not bemarketed on advantageous terms.    The President therefore asked for the concurrence of his colleagues in thetintroduction of this legislation, and for theauthority to bring a draft Bill before the Committee ofHome Affairs at the earliest possible date.- 15 - &apos;     \

THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE referred briefly tothe main points in his Memorandum.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said thatthere was some indication that opinion in New Zealand was be-ginning to contrast the readiness of this country to helpforeign countries with its attitude towards the Dominions.Mr. Nash, who was now in this country, wanted money for threepurposes- to meet a maturing loan, to balance his budget andfor defence purposes.     He thought that the possibility that thelast-named requirement might be met by the Export credits guarantee Scheie should be borne in mind when consideration was given to the question of a revised limit for the non*-commercial credits under Section 4 of the Act of 1939.     Therewas also the consideration that Mr. Nash was in touch with theLabour Opposition.     He thought that it was important that Mr.Nash should not leave this country without having secured somehelp to meet his needs.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE rather doubted whether New Zealand would welcome the grant to her of an ex-port credit under a scheme which implied that she was notcredit-wo rthy.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said that a recent Report of the Chiefs of Staff made it clear that,looked at from the  defence point of view, New Zealand&apos;s defence prob-lems were of minor importance as compared with the defence problems which faced us in Europe.In the course of discussion, reference was made to thescheme which New Zealand had agreed to operate for the train-ing of recruits for the Royal Air Force.     It was agreed that-this was a valuable form of assistance and that the schemewhich New Zealand had accepted was favourable to us.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the New Zealand aspect of the matter would be met if the President of the Board ofTrade undertook to consult with the Dominions Secretary inaddition to the other Ministers named in his Memorandum, whendeciding the exact amount of the increased figure for non-commercial guarantees which Parliament should be invited to sanction.     This course was agreed to.

THE SECRETARY OP S^ATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he welcomed the proposals in the President1 sMemorandum, and he would like to set out some of the considerations which he thought should be borne inmind in settling the new limit to be included inthe Bill.On the political side we were living in whatwas virtually a state of concealed war.    vVe were engaged in an attempt to form a coalition of actual or potential allies.   We had already given some measure of financial help to Poland, Greece, roumania and ^turkey, but of a kind. and. in a degree which hethought corresponded to their commercial rather than to their military requirements .   He thought, that thetime had come when the financial help which weafforded, to Poland and Turkey must be regarded from,the military rather than from, the commercial pointof view.    The same applied, though perhaps in a rather less degree, to Greece and roumania,   Hethought that it was illogical to enter into under-takings with these countries if we did not at thesame time assist then? to be strong militarily.These four countries   Poland, murkey, Greecea.n^ Roumania.   he would place in the first category.The second  category woul^  consist o^ Portugal, egypt and. Iraq   countries allied to us, but less immedi-ately threatened.    The third  category would consistof countries such as Yugo-Slavia and Bulgaria, and perhaps Spain, which were wavering between the rome-Berlin Axis and the democratic countries, but which might turn in the right direction i^ givensuitable help.    The fourth category would, includeAfghanistan an^ Saudi-Arabia   countries which were unlikely to Join the enemy, but which, for various reasons, we should wish to support.

Turning to particular countries, the Secretaryof State thought tfiat Poland would require a grfcfcideal of assistance.    It could well be claimed thatthe whole future of Europe might depend upon Polandbeing sufficiently strengthened to resist attack byGermany.    It was clear that this was dependent uponimmediate material and financial help being forth-coming .It was true that we had given substantial help to turkey.    In his view however this did not mean that weshould afford, no further help.   Both on politicaland strategic grounds Turkey&apos;s importance \va.s verygreat.    There were already indications that theconclusion of a satisfactory political agreementwith ^turkey might well be dependent upon theconclusion o^ a sa.tisfa.factory financial agreement.He hoped,  therefore, that discussions with theTurkish representatives would start on the basis that, while we could not meet all the Turkishrequests, we hoped to he able to meet some of them.The Foreign Secretary said that, apart from thequestion of the amount of the increa.se which parliament should be aske* to sanction, there were certain important points in connection with the newExport Credits Pill which he thought required further consideration.   These were as follows(l) That any new legislation should -be drafted so as to make it possiblefor countries which we wished to help to obtain essential armaments from third  countries:(S) That any new legislation should be drafted, so as to make it-possiblefor countries which we wished to help to obtain essential raw materials fromthe British Empire and, in emergency,from third, countries:

(3) That we should consider what part ofthe increased demands from our allies should be met by Export Credits, and what part might have to be met byloans.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he had held -two meetings with the colleagues who wereassociate^ with him in considering our financialposition.   A draft statement was in course of prepara-tion, which, it was thoueht, would provide the most useful form, of document, for Submission to the Cabinet,dealing with the financial situation,   He hoped thatit would be possible for a third meeting to be heldin the ensuing week, to consider this document, andit would be of assistance if, at that, meeting, heand his colleagues could have before them, a statement as to the total amount, of further assistance by wayof credits which the Foreign Office thought would, benecessary.He entirely agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;view that it was essential that, we should do   -the utmost in our power to meet these demands.   Hewas not sure, however, that the rea.l na.ture of theproblem was always appreciated.   Thus, recently inconnection with certain d.ema.nd.s of this nature, theexpression had been used that &quot;the sacrifice must bemade&quot;.    This, he thought, wa.s fundamentally a. falseview.    The real question was how much was  it within our power to do,  even at the cost of weakening ourown position.    In a. given instance it might be aquestion of whether we ought  to give certain.in a.ssist-ance at the cost of reducing our own powers of resistance in war by a. given period.    As showing thegreat increase in demand? made upon us, the Chancellorpointed out. that in the previous January the Foreign office had agreed to an allocation of non-commercial credits

amounting to  10 millions.     Judging by the list of countries which the Foreign Secretary had cited,there would seem to be no limit to the demands whichmight now be made upon us0     He was unwilling to run the risk of doing irreparable injury to the country by considering these demands individually, and he therefore urged the Foreign Secretary to let him havea list showing the total amount of non-commercialcredits which he now regarded as necessary.      He could then discuss this list with the colleagues who wereassociated with him in considering our financialposition.The proposal that we should help, sayPoland or Turkey to buy arms or raw materials from foreign countries involved us in the provision offoreign exchange^     We could not continue to afford the loss of gold at the present rate, and he did not know by what means we could secure the necessary foreign exchange.      He could not express any more definite viewuntil he and his colleagues had had an opportunity of considering these demands for special credits as awhole.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that hewas grateful to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for theMemorandum which the Cabinet was to receive on thefinancial position.     He hop^d   that this memorandum would also deal with the financial position in Germany.It would be useful to know the Treasury view as to how long Germany could continue to spend money on armamentsat the present rate.     Further,  if it appeared that theGerman financial situation was better than ours, weshould have to consider whether we should have to make some alteration in our own system.

THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO referred tothe powers in the Ministry of Supply Bill dealing with&quot;blockade buying&quot;, namely, provisions to enable theMinister to purchase supplies of materials, etc.,required for the public service, which would otherwise be exported to foreign countries.      If these powers were extensively used, considerable expenditure would be involved.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR WAR referred tothe Delegations from Turkey, Poland and Portugal whichwere at present in this country, all with demands for munitions.      Demands from Roumania were also anticipated.General Weygand, after his recent tour to the Near East,had expressed the view that there should be a division oflabour in this matter between the major Powers, and he was,fortha?, of the opinion that Russia should supply the countriesin Eastern Europe with arms and raw materials.     TheSecretary of State thought that we should arrange withthe French the best means of dealing with the demands made on both our countries by other foreign countries.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thatany scheme to enable a foreign country to purchaseraw materials or armaments in a third country was reallytantamount to a loan and could not be grafted on to an export Credit Guarantee Bill.     As regards the general questions referred to by the Foreign Secretary, he thoughtthat it was more important to look at the immediatefuture than to consider the more distant future.     As oneof the Chancellor&apos;s colleagues associated with him in considering the financial position, he appreciated thedifficulties of our present system.     He thought, however,that this might lead to the conclusion not that the demands on us must be reduced, but that we might have to facedrastic changes in our own system.-21-

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was particularly impressed with the two following points:first, the difficulties of the exchange position and,secondly, the difficulty of finding any halfway housebetween our own system and the Totalitarian system.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR thought that it was ofthe utmost importance to examine more closely than had hitherto been the case, the prices which were beingpayed under the rearmament programme.In the course of further discussion, THE foreign secretary referred to three further telegrams which had just been received from our Ambassador in Turkeyindicating that strong pressure ?/as being brought tobear on us to meet Turkey&apos;s financial and economic needs.The Foreign Secretary thought that it would beof advantage to the Cabinet to have before them the review of the financial situation promised by theChancellor of the Exchequer.THE MINISTER FOR CO-OHDINaTIOK OF DEFENCE saidthat he had had some discussion with General Gamelinwith regard to the demands made on us and on France by allied countries.     His discussion, however, had dealtnot with the financial but with the strategical issues,namely, whether the French would prefer that we shouldsupply raw materials to, for instance, Poland at theexpense of reducing our own rearmament programme.THE CHaKCELLOK OF THE EXCHEQUER undertook to bear in mind the points referred to by theSecretary of State for Air.     The main differencebetween our system and the German system was that,under the latter, the Government had power to fixwages and every person in the country could be

compelled to act exactly as the Government desiredunder1 pain of being thrown into a concentrationcamp.     Hours had been lengthened and any profitsearned were at the disposal of the governments the Cabinet agreed:-(l) To authorise the introductionas soon as po sible of Export CreditsLegislation -(a) to increase the limit of  10millions in respect of non-commercial guarantees underSection 4 of the export guarantees Act, 1939;(b) to enable the Treasury to arrangefinance for promissory notes, etcSj)guaranteed by the Department at times when those notes could notbe marked on advantageous terms:(2) That the amount of the increase referredto in l(a) should be settled by theChancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of Trade, inconsultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of Sbate for Dominion Affairs:(3) To invite the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to submit to theChancellor of the Exchequer a statementindicating the amount of additionalnon-commercial credits which, in his view, should now be granted and thecountries concerned.   This statement would be considered by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the colleagues whowere   associated with him in consideringthe financial position.(4) To invite the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to take intoconsideration the point raised bythe Secretary of State for War inregard to proposed common action bythe French Government and ourselves in dealing with the demands made by foreign countries for armaments andfinancial assistance  stancea

90 The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Education(CP. 13h (39)) regarding the provision of voluntary Senior Schools in Liverpool     The pasthistory of this problem was set out and a copy was attached of a scheme worked out by a localCommittee (containing representatives both of thelocal authorities and of all the religiousdenominations concerned) with a view to solving the difficult problem of proper school accommodation in liverpool, particularly for the large roman catholic population5 and bringing to an end thedeplorable conditions which had existed for someyears.       The essential features of this scheme,which had received the approval of the LiverpoolEducation Committee and of the City Council, were as follows(a) The Authority would themselves provideschool sites and buildings in substitution for those for which the denominationalschool authorities submitted proposals under the Education Act, 1936, withinthe time limits allowed by Section 8 (2)of that Act, and would lease the schoolpremises so provided to the denominationalauthorities on terms to be approved bythe Board:(b) The appointment of teachers in the leasedschools would be in accordance with theprovisions of Section 10 (l) of theEducation Act, 1936, the proportion of!r;oserved&quot; teachers at each school being arranged in accordance with thecircumstances of the school.The approval of all the diverse localelements concerned had been obtained to a scheme on these lines and the President therefore suggested to his colleagues that, in view of the peculiar     .____conditions obtaining in Liverpool, which constituted a large-scale social as well as educational problem,the proposed scheme should be accepted and that an-24-

announcement should he made that the Governmentwere prepared to legislate to chat end.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATIONexplained the main points in his Memorandum.     Hethought that it had. been a remarkable achievement for agreement to he reached by representatives of interests which were normally irreconcilable.     He was satisfied with the scheme put forward for thesolution of a serious problem which had existed formany years.     He thought it would be wrong to take theresponsibility for refusing to accept a suggestion which would put an end to this very difficult situation.     At the same time, he thought it was important to make   clear the position of theGovernment;    namely,that they accepted the solution which the Liverpool Education Committee pressed for.     It was of the utmost importance that the scheme should be approved in the course of the presentSummer.     This could only be done if the LiverpoolMembers of Parliament made it clear to the representa-tives of the different Parties in the House that itwas their desire that the scheme should go through asan agreed measure, possibly after llo0 p.m.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that the solution was a wise one.     The origin .of this case lay in the action of a local authority which had refused to avail itself of the provisionsof the 1936 Act.     This state of affairs was not peculiar to Liverpool and the same situation had arisen in, for example, the West Riding of Yorkshire.He hoped that the door might be left open to similar action being taken if other authorities, who had notavailed themselves of the Act of 1936, were prepared

to reach agreement on the lines of the Liverpoolscheme.     Prima facie, he thought that the schemewhich was being applied to the Roman Catholicschools in Liverpool should also be regarded asapplicable to Church of England children.In the course of the discussion which ensuedthe view was generally expressed that, if any attempt was made to extend the Liverpool scheme to otherparts of the country, the whole basis, of agreementwotxld break down.     It was also pointed out that theconditions at Liverpool, where there was a largehomogeneous Roman Catholic population, did not exist in other parts of the country.     The view was also expressed that it was extremely desirable to get thepresent agreement accepted as quickly as possible.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-(l)   To authorise an announcement to theeffect that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere prepared to accept the scheme proposed, and to introduce legislation to give effect to it.(2)   To authorise the drafting of a Billfor consideration by the Home AffairsCommittee, with a view to its intro-duction this Session on the under-standing that the Billrs progressthis Session would depend upon its being accepted as an agreed measure.

BARTER 10.        THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OFNEGOTIATIONSWITH THE TRADE said that throughout the negotia-UNITED STATESOF AMERICA. tions with the United States Government(Previous it had &quot;been agreed that the price &quot;basisReference:Cabinet should be the average price prevailing32 (39),Conclusion 12) in the first four months of the current year.     Recently, cotton prices had risen, but rubber prices had remainedrelatively stable.      If, therefore, theagreement was signed on the present basis, it would appear as though theUnited States was losing approximatelyft 2,000,000 on the deal, assuming thatthe total volume of cotton and rubbercovered by the transaction were valued at present-day prices.      Such a basiswas, however, quite unreal.      It was evident that the price of cotton in theUnited States was fictitious and wasbeing deliberately maintained by theUnited States Government above theworld price.     A fall in cotton prices in the United States of America in thenear future was almost inevitable.Rubber prices, on the other hand, were probably too low and were likely to riseas soon as the terms of the agreement were published.The true position was,  therefore,that the present price basis in the agree-ment operated in a manner ^favourable   to us

The United States Ambassador, however, was pressing for an alteration which would make matters worse for us; namely, the adoption asthe price basis of the average price overthe period 1st January, 1939, to the dateof the conclusion of the agreement.This would me em an advantage of some8600,000 to the United States.      It was represented that this was a point onwhich the United States Government mightbe prepared to break off negotiations. on merits,    the concession asked for shouldbe refused.      In view, however, of theimportance of our relations with theUnited States at the present time, hethought it right to bring the matter tothe notice of his colleagues.At the suggestion of the PrimeMinister, the Cabinet agreed:-That this matter should be deter-mined by -The Prime Minister.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and theThe President of the Board ofTrade,in consultation.
