DEFENCE 1,      THE PRIME MINISTER recalled^ the. decisionREGULATIONS.of the Cabinet, reached at the Meeting referred to(Previous in the margin, as regards the date at which the reference:Cabinet 28 (39)   Defence Regulations should be put into  orce.     HeConclusion 8)said that there was some doubt as to the regulations which should be introduced as soon as an emergencyoccurred and that it was important that this matter should be cleared up as quickly as possible.The Prime Minister accordingly proposed,and the Cabinet agreed, that a Cabinet Committeeshould be set up, composed as follows:-The Home Secretary (Chairman),The Lord Privy Seal,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Supply-Designate,,The Prime Minister thought that later on certain questions would arise as to the form of theRegulations, on which the advice of the LordChancellor would be of great assistance, but he didnot think that it was necessary that the LordChancellor should be troubled with the matters thatwould fall to be discussed by the proposed CabinetCommittee.

THE financial situation.(previous reference:Cabinet 29 (39)Conclusion 3)2.      The Cabinet had. he or^..them -(l)   A Memorandum on the German FinancialEffort for Re-armament  (CP. 148 (39));(2)    A Memorandum on the Financial Position(CP.  149  (39)).In view of the special need for secrecy,copies of these two Memoranda were handed in by ministers on the conclusion of the discussion.     Forthe same reason, a note of the discussion is notcirculated, but a single copy is retained in theSecx-etary&apos; s Standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.5th July, 1939.

THE financial situation.;(previous reference:Cabinet 29(39), Con-clusion 3. )The Cabinet had before them -(1) A Memorandum on the German FinancialEffort for Rearmament (CP. 148 (39));(2) A Memorandum on the Financial Position(CP.  149 (39)).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER dealt first with the Memorandum on the Financial Situation(CP. 149 (39)).    In this Paper an attempt hadbeen made to bring together a number of considerations of the utmost importance and of very great secrecy.He suggested that, in the circumstances, these twoCabinet Papers should be handed in on the conclusionof the Meeting.This course was agreed to.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that th*contents of this Paper had been discussed with thoseof his colleagues who were associated with him in considering our financial position.     While hiscolleagues had not approved every sentence in thisMemorandum, the general line had been approved bythem all.The Chancellor then dealt with the firstsection of his Paper, headed &quot;The War Chest&quot;, which represented our staying-power in war.    There werefour possible sources from which we might hope to pay for and acquire goods which we should need to importfrom overseas in the event of war, namely, -(l) Our   export trade;(2) Stocks of gold;(3) Foreign securities owned by Britishsubjects which the Government couldacquire in order to increase ourpurchasing power in the United States;(4) Loans abroad.As regards exports, in 1914 we had had a    ____substantial favourable balance of trade, wheninvisible exports were taken into accounts  Although

we should take steps to stimulate exports in time ofwar, it did not look as though we could count on balance on any considerable source of strength underthis head.As regards gold stocks, the position was setout in paragraphs 4 to 9 of CP. 149 (39).    TheChancellor drew particular attention to the fact thatthe sterling balances held in London by countries of the sterling bloc were estimated to be falling atthe rate of some  80 millions a year.As regards paragraph 10, he understood theview of the President of the Board of Trade to be thatthe diversion of activities from peaceful enterpriseto war preparation tended, on the whole, to lead toa decline of exports, but that there were certaincountervailing factors.Turning to the paragraphs dealing with themeasures taken to protect the exchange, the Chancellorsaid that his colleagues would no doubt ask whetherif the level of the   was allowed to drop, we should put a stop to the loss of gold which was takingplace.    The answer to this was that it was held thatit was essential to maintain the level of the   to our utmost ability.    Any further substantial drop in thevalue of the  , which had already dropped to $4.68,would have very serious consequences for the UnitedStates of America.    If we allowed the value of the  to drop substantially, such a step would be likely tobe resented by the United States of America, who mightwell take corresponding measures to change the relation between the Dollar and gold, which wouldnullify our action in devaluing the pound.As regards foreign securities which theGovernment could requisition, the position as statedin paragraph 25 was that we could, by requisitioning,

obtain some  200 millions of foreign securities whichwe could hope to sell, but no more.The view was expressed by certain ministers that this figure was far below the total of British--held foreign securities.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thatthere were, no doubt, other assets in foreign countriesheld by British subjects, but the view of the expertswas that it would not be possible to realise suchholdings to any appreciable extent.-The fourth factor in our war chest was represented by foreign borrowings.    In the last War wehad borrowed  250 millions from private investorsabroad, which had been repaid; but the sums borrowedfrom the United States Government had not been repaid,and the position under the Johnson Act was that wecould not borrow in the United States to-day, eitherprivately or from the Government.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE askedwhether it was not the fact that in the last war we lent very large sums of money to Russia and Italy.Was it not a fair presumption that demands from our allies in the next war for financial assistance wouldbe less than in the last War?THE CHANCELLOR 0? THE EXCHEQUER said that itwas not possible to frame any estimate of the rate atwhich the resources of our war chest might be drawn on in the event of war.    The figure given in paragraph30, which was a very imperfect guide, was the bestindication which could be given, iThe Chancellor said that the broad upshotof this part of the Memorandum was that we should realise that we were steadily reducing our war chest.It was impossible to say when war might break out.    Ifit should break out some years hence, it was important

that those who were responsible for policy should realise that our financial strength was then likelyto be much weaker than it was to-day.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER then turned to the second section of the paper - Money for Defence.On the whole, he thought that this section was toofavourably stated.    He drew attention to the fact that,whereas in February of this year the estimate for defence expenditure had been  580 millions, this figure had risenin April to  630 millions and now to  750 millions.    If 750 millions was to be spent on defence in 1939, hethought that the figures given for 1940 and 1941 mightwell prove to be under the mark, since up to the present it had not been thought that we should reach the peak ofdefence expenditure in the current financial year.Further, the figures in these paragraphsassumed that no further major increase of defence expenditure was authorised.    It also assumed that noforeign loans were granted.The Chancellor drew attention to the figures in paragraph 33 which set out the balance which would haveto be found for defence expenditure, after making allowance for defence expenditure which could be met from revenueon the basis of existing taxation.    How were these vastsums to be found?   It was also to be borne in mind thatin the current year we should be helped by a circumstancewhich would not occur again, namely that owing to theloss of gold the Exchange Equalisation Account hadavailable  150 millions of sterling which had been usedto reduce the volume of Treasury Bills.One course would be to have an Autumn Budgetwith large increases in taxation.    In any event, however,heavy increases in the ensuing year seemed inevitable.Another possible course was that the banks &quot;should be instructed to allow overdrafts to their

customers on condition that these overdraftswould be used for investment in Government loans.This, of course, would result in an increase in theamount of money in circulation and inflation, whichwould give rise to an increase in prices, whichwould be a grave matter.    Clearly this course should not be resorted to until absolutely necessary.The Chancellor then drew attention tothe salient points in paragraphs 36-41.    The statement in paragraph 41 that the normal cost of maintenanceseemed likely to require some  450 millions - a figure unattainable on the present scale of taxation -was perhaps the most depressing of all.    He felt,however, that for the time being it was a mistake toattempt to look too far ahead.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thenreferred to the main points in the third sectionof the paper head - Conclusions.    He thought that paragraph 44 should be amended by the insertionafter &apos;avoided&apos;  in line 2 of the words &quot;to any marked extent&quot;.    Paragraph 44 pointed to theconclusion that we ought to consider something in the nature of a new ration for defence expenditure.    As regards paragraph 46 he was not sure whether it was possible to provide estimates of the extra strain on the exchanges involved insubstantial new expenditures, but such estimateswould be useful if they could be provided.Paragraph 47 represented the extension of a plan which had already been carried out successfullyon a small scale.

The Chancellor of the Exchequerthen turned to the paper on the german financial Effort for Rearmament (CP. 148 (39)).His broad reflection on this paper was that,whatever method Germany may have relied on inthe past, she had now come to rely on immenselyheavy taxation of the working classes, coupled with a far lower rate of expenditure on thesocial services.    This was brought out by the table in paragraph 16.    As regards civil expenditure, Germany with a population of90 millions spent less than we spent with a population of 50 millions.    Broadly, whileGermany had in.the past relied largely onborrowing and less on taxation, she was nowmoving into the position irt which she wasrelying less on borrowing and more on taxation.The Chancellor said that he thoughtit would be a convenience if his colleagues were to have an opportunity of putting questions to Sir Richard Hopkins.This course was agreed to.(Sir Richard Hopkins, Second Secretaryto the Treasury, then entered theMeeting.)

With reference to paragraph 34 of CP.149(39) SIR RICHARD HOPKINS explained that thereason why we&apos; had been able to borrow an additional 150 millions on Treasury Bills in 1939 but couldnot do so in future years was that we could not contemplate a further loss of gold in largequantities without a determined effort&apos;to checkit.      Of course if gold continued to be lost,to that extent we should be able to borrowadditional sums by Treasury Bills with the sterlingwhich would become available in the exchange equalisation Account.      Broadly speaking therewere two ways of approaching the problem;    one was by attempting to reach agreement with the UnitedStates of America on devaluation;    the other was by meastires of control including measures to limit the import of commodities.      In reply to theHome Secretary he said that the Treasury sawtheir way clear to continue until the lateAutumn, at least, without the adoption of special measures.      Indeed, he thought that it would be dangerous to adopt such measures until a stage of full employment had been reached, since suchaction would be a shock to ^confidence and would beregarded as a deflatory measure.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR asked SirRichard Hopkins what were his views on the naturallevel of sterling, and whether it was fair to saythat we were weakening our position by notallowing the natural level to operate.

SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that in theopinion of some the level of&quot; sterling was rathertoo high.      Any difference of opinion on thismatter however related to a relatively smallmargin,  say $4,55 to $4.68, and this would havehut little effect on the gold losses.      Anattempt to stop gold losses by a reduction in thevalue of sterling would rather involve adevaluation of the pound to say $4.20.      any measure of devaluation would, for the time being,have the effect of increasing exports anddecreasing imports.      It must be remembered,however, that any large modification in theexchange level would have a disturbing effect andwould not be effective if other countries tookretaliatory measures.      Further a number of countries&apos;&apos;in the sterling/bloc banked in London and would,it eo\ild be assumed,  automatically follow sterling. &apos;.There was also the Question whether the UnitedStates of America would automatically followsuit.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR askedwhether it was true that the position in regardto the export trade would be improved if thelevel of sterling was allowed to drop.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that  if there wasa substantial fall in the sterling dollar exchange   ,there would certainly be beneficial effects inregard to our trade with the United States andSouth American Countries for the time being.

He agreed however with an observation by thePresident of the Board of Trade that the effectof devaluation of sterling in 1931 had lastedfor a very short time.      On that occasion it had become evident that sterling had been strongerthat other currencies and the result of devaluation of sterling had been, broadly speaking, not a rise in sterling prices but a drop in other prices.      He agreed with the lord privy Seal that there was no evidence to showthat a drop in the exchange rates had more than atransitory effect.      He also agreed with theHome Secretary that the effect was the more likely to be transient here because of thestrength of organised labour which had theeffect of making wages respond very quickly to changes in the prices of commodities.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR asked SirRichard Hopkins whether his view was that wewere not in a position to fight a long war.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that the situationundoubtedly grew more difficult with every monththat passed.      If war should break out in thenear future, we should have in our war chestthe existing gold stockbless those foreignbalances which would be removed.      If, however,war occurred say a year hence those stocks wouldhave been diminished by the drain in the intervening year.      So long as we continued onthe present course, our financial position wasbeing weakened.      The adverse balance of trade

resulted in a steady loss.      This loss wouldbe increased if we stimulated the productionof armament goods which involved imports of rawmaterials.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said thathe had understood that it was the fundamentalfeature of our policy that we should conserveour strength for a long war, and he asked SirRichard Hopkins whether that strength had gone.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that this was nothis view, but the Memorandum drew attention tovery serious matters which must be borne inmind.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR askedwhether we were&apos;In a worse position to fighta long war than in 1914.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that this mustbe the case,  subject to the quest ion whether theUnited States of America was prepared to help us with finance.asked whether the United States were in a better 1position to finance us than in 1916.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that the United-States of America was a country of immensewealth.      He did not think that their vast goldstocks would be of much help.to them in.financing us in war.      The primary need would bethat they should give us a share of their production without our paying for it.      he agreed that the production of gold from SouthAfrica could be increased, but South Africangold belonged to Soiith Africa and we shouldTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE

have in effect to pay for it,  either by exportsto South Africa or by a loan from thatcountry,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR drew attention to a statement in paragraph 6 of theintroductory section of CP. 148(39) whichreferred to the self-sufficiency of Germany.He contrasted with this a paper prepared by theIndustrial Intelligence Centre which reached theconclusion that German;/ could not last out for more than a year of war.      He also referred to a paper which the Director of the industrial intelligence Centre had read to the ImperialDefence College which indicated that germany would have to produce at seven times her existing 1&quot;rate if she was to maintain 100 divisions in the   1field.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that he was not qualified to speak on the capacity of Germany to    1wage a world war;    no doubt the views in thepaper expressed by the Director of the industrial intelligence Centre did not purport to be morethan estimates.      lie did not think that our war plans were prepared on the assumption that war could not in any case last for more thana year.      The important point was, he thought,that for whatever period the war lasted,whether a year or longer, we should have tocontinue to import food, and raw materials.Germany, on the other hand, had not gotcommand of the seas and could not expect to import goods except from adjacent countries.Her nlans had therefore been drawn, on the basisof self-sufficiency.

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR asked whether thelogic of this argument was not that we should make every acre of this country as productive as possible?SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that no doubt this process could be carried to a certain further stagewith reasonable economy.     He thought, however, thatto apply our resources to the uneconomic developmentof the agricultural capacity of this country wouldprobably involve an even greater strain on our resources than dependence on imports.      It seemedto him that the right course was that we should seek to reserve a reasonable part of our foreign exchange resources in case we were in a tight corner.      he also thought that we should consider every possiblemethod of forcing the export trade in time of war,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the point of para-graph 6 in the Introductory Section (CP.-148 (39))was that Germany relied on the policy of stocks orself-sufficiency.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS agreed.      If at anytime Germany was short of a particular commodityand had to buy from countries overseas, her lack ofgold would be the determining factor.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that these papers held out a dismal prospect forthis countrybut not for Germany.     Thus paragraph 19 of CP. 148(39) appeared to indicate that Germany could keep upher expenditure on armaments indefinitely.      In thisconnection the Secretary of State for War drew attention to paragraph 5, on page 2 of CP. 148 (39).He asked whether it was in fact the case that germany was in no way relaxing her efforts and that she would keep up expenditure on armaments indefinitely.

SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that so far as concerned internal finance, he thought that this seemed to he the case.      So far as concernedobtaining necessisties from abroad, there was agreat difference between the position of thiscountry and that of Germany.      Germany was largelyself-supporting in food.     A commodity such asrubber was now produced in Germany by synthetic    ;processes, though at great cost, thereby limiting the need for imports from abroad.      So far as concerned overseas finance, Germany was bankruptand the position was kept going by very severecontrols which limited the imports of what weshould regard as necessary commodities.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR askedwhether it was a fact that Germany had spentbetween  3,000 and  4,000 millions on armamentsin the last six years without starving herpopulation..SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that this wasbroadly true.      It had been done by lowering thestandard of living.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that German workers had good houses andsanitation and other services.     Was their standardof living really so low?SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that the purchasingpower of wage earners in this country was greater,.::In this country wages had risen as compared with1929, but the position of German wage earners was much below the 1929 level.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIR sithought that the position was that the German

worker worked harder than the worker in this country,and went short of amenities.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE drew attentionto a report which had just been received from theCommercial Attache in Berlin, who expressed the view thatthe last few weeks showed an increasing strain on thewhole German system.     He also drew attention to the almost complete absence of ordinary consumption goods.The German worker could not spend his money on radios,clothes or furniture.     He could only spend his money on beer, food and tobacco or invest-it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR asked whether a financial breakdown in Germany could be regarded aseither inevitable or indeed likely..SIR RICHARD HOPKINS saw no reason to anticipate a breakdown, at any rate within an early period of time.The ease with which the German financial situation hadbeen coped with was, he thought, due to several causes.In the first years of the Nazi regime it was possible toraise large sums of money by borrowing, Without inflation-tionary effects,  since the country had been in a deepdepression and unemployment had been rife.     Borrowinghad, however, been rapidly reduced and taxation increased.So long as the present heavy rates of taxation were bornewithout a mutiny, this side of the position could beregarded as safe.     The rate of borrowing in Germany was still very high and as the community, was now fully em-ployed it must in the main be inflationary in character.It was uncertain how far borrowing could continue at thepresent rate.Z&quot;*At this point the SECRETARY OF STATE FORSCOTLAND left the Meeting^

THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE asked whetherGermany ran greater risk of industrial than of financialbreakdown.      She had already reached the limit ofincreasing production so far as unemployment was con-cerned.     A certain amount had. been done to speed upproduction, but the limits of increase in that directionhad already been reached.     Was it not possible that a fall in industrial production might bring about a financial,breakdown?SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that he saw no prospectof such a drop in industrial production in Germany as would bring about a financial breakdown.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR AIR said that Sir Richardhad said that Germany was spending more than we werespending on armaments, that there was a prospect thatGermany could fight a war as long as we could, and that none of the remedies proposed seemed likely to see usthrough a life-and-death struggeUe,     Was it not necessarythat we should consider whether we should do more thanmodel ourselves on German methods?SIR RICHARD HOPKINS referred to the measures indi-cated in CP.-149 (39), particularly paragraphs 36 and 40.In reply to the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs he agreed that some of the measures there proposed should not be taken until all the absorbable unemployedhad been absorbed.     He thought that we should reach afull measure of employment (after allowing for thosepassing from one job to another, and for the &quot;hard core&quot;of unemployed) in a fairly short time, at the present rate of progress.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that CP.-149(39)  seemed to indicate two alternative courses:     thatwe should copy Germany&apos;s taxation, or &quot;that we should

adopt the measures of control therein indicated.Possibly both these courses should be adopted.     He notedthat the various methods of control were being studied,and he assumed that before the Cabinet was invited toreach any conclusions they would be informed of the&apos;result of that study.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that the combination of courses suggested in CP.-149 (39) was put forward asa line of action which it might well be necessary to adopting order to avoid a financial breakdown in course oftime.     The study was directed to the practical measureswhich would have to be taken;:   as, for example, thestatutory and administrative form which these measures would takes the SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR asked whether, ifthe measures set out in paragraphs 36 and 40 were adopted, we should be in a position to meet Germany&apos;expenditure on armaments?SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that if these steps were adopted we should be in a far stronger position than we were today.      He was assuming, of course,  that thecountry could be persuaded of the need for these measures.     This was not a matter on which he couldexpress an opinion.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR drew attention to paragraph 35, which appeared to indicate a halt in expenditure on armaments..THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE referredto paragraph 6 of the Introductory Section of CP.-148(39), where it was stated that Germany could not expect to import goods from overseas in war.     He said that inthe last war Germany had imported large quantities ofgoods from Scandinavia, and would, be able to do so again.
\
121n1SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that it had not beenwithin his knowledge that Germany had been able to secure a large volume of imports in the last War.     Any large volume of German imports in war would pro tanto modify the argument in the paragraph referred to.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that the large volume of German imports in thelast war had been due in part to the fact that we had beenslow in imposing measures of rationing.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE askedwhether it was not the fact that the present heavy rateof expenditure on. armaments to a considerable extentforeshadowed expenditure which in the last War had taker-place in the first two years of the War?     There was alsothe consideration that we might not have the same demandsof our allies upon us for financial help.   Was it not therefore possible that the demands upon our war chest inthe next war v/ould not be so great as in the last War?SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that an attempt had ,been made to get some estimate from the Departmentsconcerned of the volume of imports likely to be required inwar-time, but the attempt had been given up as impracticable,He thought, however, that it must be assumed that war,as v/e now knew it, would be gigantically expensive inmaterial, and that, whatever stores and reserves we mightaccumulate in time of peace, we must expect munitions tobe produced at the highest practicable rate, which wouldmean that we should be largely dependent on imports of rawmaterials.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat v/e had not decided to raise an Army on the scale, ofLord Kitchener&apos;s Army, and that the German Navy to-daywas not as big as the German Navy in 1914.

SIR RICHARD HOPKINS agreed that these factorswere important.      On the other hand, it was impossibleto present a complete picture of what we should beable, to do in war by way of export trade. -    There mightbe great confusion in the world markets, and our shipsmight suffer severely from air attack on our ports.It might be dotibted whether we should in fact be ableto export goods in adequate quantities to other countries as well as to produce what we ourselves required.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought that we might well be taking too gloomy a view of the position.He referred to a statement made by Sir John (afterwardsLord) Bradbury, in 1915, to the effect that furtherborrowing here would only be possible at the price ofsuch an inflation of credit in relation to availablecommodities as would finally upset the balance ofexchange and seriously impair our power to purchaseeither munitions or foodstuffs in America;    and to various statements made by Mr. McKenna and Mr. J.M. Keynesin 1915, which had been falsified by the event.      Was it not possible that the Treasury were again being toodismal on this occasion?SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that we now startedwith knowledge of the extent to which distressedeconomic systems had in fact been able to endure for anumber of years.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he rather shared the view that the general effect of these Papers might be to give too gloomy a view.All things were comparative.      If our position was difficult, the position of Germany was very likely to beeven more difficult in regard to the conduct of a longwar.       If, notwithstanding all her efforts, Germany was unable to make herself self-sufficient, that militated

against the theory of a long war.      If this view waswell founded, we should not exclude the possibility thatour maximum effort would be well, applied if we assumed the prospect of a reasonably short war.     Even if this assumption should prove to be wrong and the war shouldlast longer than we anticipated, it would be reasonablysafe to assume that when the war had continued for sometime the attitude of the United States would be suffiently favourable to us to enable us to win thewar.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that if we assumeda short war, many of the apprehensions expressed in thefirst&apos; part of the Memorandum fell to the ground.     liehad always understood, however, that we could not proceed on the assumption of a short war, nor could be assume thatthe United States would be willing to give us unlimitedfinancial resources in a long war.Discussion then turned on the second sectionof CP.  149 (39) - Money for Defence.In reply to the Lord Privy Seal, SIR RICHARDsaid that from the point of view of our internal economy,it was impossible to continue to proceed on the existingbasis.      It was certain that, even if it was not necessary to introduce the machinery of control set out inparagraph 40 in peace&apos;time, it would be required very soonin war.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE made thepoint that at the present time we were being subjected to a war strain in times of peace and were trying tomaintain the position by peace methods.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER agreed thatthat was the immediate moral to be drawn from this partof the paper.     It was, of course, possible to do manythings in war which could not be done in time of peace.He also emphasised that the second part of the paper dealt,-19-

not with a hypothetical issue but with the actualsituation which faced us.      It was clear    that before long we should reach a position when we could not carryon with ordinary methods and supplementary methods wouldhave to be employed.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said he assumed that the Chancellor was not advocating any relaxation of the measures of defence which had been approved bythe House of Commons.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER agreed, but said that the point might well be reached when themultiplication of effort in a number of directions didnot increase the strength of our position.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR thought thatthe acceptance of the sacrifices set out in this paper would have moral effect which would act as a powerfuldeterrent, by showing our determination.THE&apos; CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER added thatthe conclusion recorded in paragraph 40 had been reached on the basis of existing estimates of expenditure which seemed likely to be exceeded.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR referring to paragraph 40 said that he regarded the control of price as essential and he asked why the Memorandum spoke of&quot;possibly also control of prices&quot;.SIS RICHARD HOPKINS explained that the matter had been expressed in this way for two reasons:    first,that this was a matter which was rather more in the sphere of the President of the Board of Trade than ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer;    second, that he believedthat control of prices would come somewhat later in time than the other methods of control suggested.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that whatever measures we adopted, it was clear that the strain on our financial strength was increasing,  and that--20-

JL eJ i.the point would ultimately come when we should heunable to carry on a long war.      There would,  therefore,come a moment which, on a balance of our financial strength and our strength in armaments was the best timefor war to break out.      It might be desirable toconsider whether at such a period we should apply strong pressure to Germany to relax the international tension.THE LORD CHANCELLOR, referring to paragraph 4-0,said that he thought that a measure which led to the stoppage of housebuilding or of the setting up of new industries would be a great shock to the public and hewas not satisfied that such a measure would reallyassist our armament programme or our financial strength.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that the purpose ofsuch a measure would be to secure that money which would otherwise be spent in, say, building new houses wasinvested in Government loans and used to meet the costof armaments.      This was what was being done in Germany.Reference was made to paragraph 25 of cp. 149 (39) in regard to the sale of foreign securitiesabroad.      Sir Richard Hopkins was asked whether thefigure of  200 millions of foreign securities, whichwe could requisition and sell, represented a maximum.SIR RICHARD said that he.thought it was.There were, no doubt, large holdings of sterlingsecurities in undertakings which operated aborad, but thequestion remained whether it would be possible to findsellers for such securities on any substantial scale.The view generally held was that there would be thegreatest difficulty in selling such securities in war.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether it would bepossible to borrow against such securities.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that the only likelylender was the United States Government.      Even if that

Government was prepared to accept such securities as security for a loan, they would only be entitled toobtain the proceeds of the security in sterling.      Theexchange difficulty - which was the pressing ground ofnon-payment of interest on the existing war debt - wouldthen remain.Reference was made to the suggestion inparagraph 47 that the process of acquiring stores ofthe various essential commodities should be carried further at the present time (in spite of the immediategold losses which that course involved) in order toavoid (a) enhanced prices and (b) difficulty of carriagein war.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thatthis matter had been under discussion since the Springand he rather thought that the Treasury had changed their view, and were not now disposed to agree to these transactions on any large scale.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that a paper would be corning before the Committee of ImperialDefence within a few days dealing with such purchases.He was convinced that this course was the right one.SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that he had not seenthis paper but for his part would be prepared torecommend acceptance of such purchases on a reasonablescale.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thatthese Memoranda had been circulated mainly for purposesof information and in order that the considerations setout therein might be borne in mind in framing future policy.      He assumed that the Chancellor did not ask forany specific conclusions to be recorded.THE CHANCELLOR agreed.

S.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,July 3, 1939.I. Introductory.THE main part of this note consists of an analysis of the present financialeffort of Germany as compared with that of this country.2. As, however, the question is often asked in general terms why thiscountry cannot at all times do what Germany does, it may be well to make one ortwo general observations on that subject.3. The present regime in Germany started in a period of great depressionwith quite a small national debt, and was in a position to use inflationary methodson a very large scale while merely taking up the slack in employment. Thecountry is now fully employed and as much of their borrowing has been andremains inflationary, they may be approaching the end of these resources and theadvantage in this one respect may lie in future on our side.4. The population is docile and ready to accept regulation. A completesystem of regimentation has been gradually built up with typical German industryuntil it permeates the whole economic machine. The system is said to be basedon discipline, but this discipline is enforced by the power of the party agents and by the fear of the concentration camp.5. Germany can and does impose upon the masses of the people much heaviertaxation than has been attempted in this country.6.   As Germany cannot expect in war to import from overseas, the policy has been to acquire great stocks of imported necessities, to produce at homesubstitutes for particular types of essential imports, though involving great[195171&apos; b
economic waste, and to acquire power over adjacent territories which can supplyGerman needs. The question of the means of payment for overseas imports inwar an ever present anxiety in our case scarcely arises in Germany. Wecannot be self-supporting even if we wish to. &apos;II. Note on the present financial effort of Germany and this country.1.   If not quite hopeless it would be an extremely difficult task to set out inany clear way the comparison between the financial effort made by Germany anda that of this country.   We should not really be comparing like with like, since i \there are profound differences between the economic systems of the two countries.The German economic system is determined by her internal political and socialsystem, which is entirely different from ours.2. Apart from this a great deal of the statistics necessary to make a comparison are not published in Germany, and so far as figures do get published in that country their propaganda aspect has no doubt been well considered inadvance.3. A third type of difficulty lies in the fact that the two currencies are not comparable. Sterling is only one value, whereas the different kinds of marks have all sorts of values. It is open to any writer who chooses to convert marks to  at the official rate of 11-9 to the  . Another author might choose 20 to the  ,and get all his figures different by nearly 70 per cent.To estimate the equivalent of marks in sterling for the purpose of thismemorandum we have the following index numbers of hourly wages : &apos;1929. Dec. 1938.Great Britain (100 in 1924)......        98-1 103-9Germany (100 in 1928)        ...      ...      105-5 84-1On the basis of 100 in 1929, the index numbers for December 1938 would therefore be for Great Britain 105 - 9 and for Germany 79 - 7. The German isto the British as 75 - 2 to 100. If the gold parity of 20 - 43 marks corresponded tomonetary equilibrium in 1929, the appropriate figure now would be 15-36 marks.Alternative comparisons based on the movement of prices since 1929 would givehigher figures. Such matters as the change in our fiscal system since 1929 tend to disturb all comparisons, and on the whole it is thought a fair rate for comparingincomes or taxes in the two countries would be 16 marks to  1. There is no realcertainty about the figure, but we do not know how to improve on it.4. As regards unofficial estimates of the position in Germany, the trouble is that there are so many of them and that they reach such conflicting results.5. Dealing with the matter in general terms, the position would appear tobe as follows : There can be no doubt that Germany has been spending absolutely a largersum and is still spending an absolutely larger sum on armaments than we are.This is what one would expect in view of the vastly greater size of her army.The fact that Germany has more money to spend so far must be due to one ormore of the following causes : a) she raises more by taxation;b) she spends less on civil government, leaving, therefore, a larger balanceavailable for defence;(c) she borrows more for defence purposes.No doubt all these things have been true in the past, but, broadly speaking, theTreasury would be inclined as regards the present to attach little importance tothe last two items and a great deal to the first.6. Assuming, indeed, that we succeed in carrying put the borrowingprogramme contemplated for this year, including that required to meet supple-men tary estimates, it may well be that on the point of borrowing we shallbe running ahead of Germany. As regards the cost of civil government, it mustbe borne in mind that with roughly the same kind of total national incomethe German population is to purs as about 5 to 3: She is notbarren of social services, of which, indeed, she was largely the&apos; pioneer,but   they   are   run   on   more   economical   lines   than   &quot;bur   own,   and
in particular a much larger proportion of the cost is fixed on the beneficiaries.German administration has by no means got the reputation for economy and theauthoritarian nature.of the Government rather implies an expensive administra-tion. Thus, while no doubt German civil government may be cheaper than oursper head,, it is prdma facie unlikely that in total it could be much cheaper, except as regards debt charges, where after six years of most lavish borrowing theannual charge cannot yet be much over  100 millions a year.7. This would leave the difference in the product of taxation as the sole ormain factor explaining the ability of Germany to spend larger sums on armamentsthan we do. There can be no doubt whatever, since the information comes fromall quarters, that in fact German taxation is higher than ours in many respects.They have, for instance, a 40 per cent, tax on the profits of companies on top ofthe ordinary income tax. Important also is the greater power they have of enforcing taxation.in the form of a subservient judiciary and the cruder methodsof the concentration camp for offenders.8. In comparing the yield of taxation in the two countries, however, thereis this to be borne in mind : Germany is really in this sphere, as in others, a year or so ahead of us. She has already achieved the almost complete abolition ofunemployment, whereas we are still a long way from that state of affairs. Inother words, while the yield of the taxation system in. Germany may be reachingits peak, it is certain that ours will not reach its peak for another year.9.   If it be asked what price Germany has paid for her success in this field,the answer is to be found in three or four directions.(i) The standard of living is much lower in Germany; as compared with \1929 German wage rates appear to be down by some 20 per cent.,whereas in our case wage rates are up by 6 per cent, since the same date. That is not to say that the Nazis have actually reduced wage rates, a statement which it would certainly be impossible to prove.The fact is that they seized power at a time of deep depression afterwage rates had been brought very low, and they have prevented any considerable recovery in those rates. The destruction of the TradeUnion machinery for securing wage increases would probably havebeen effective by itself, even without the direct State regulation ofwages.(ii) The cost of living in Germany has nominally fallen, but there has undoubtedly been a fall in real wages, and the tax burden on the jworking classes is now extremely heavy.   Likewise the standard of fliving of the middle and upper classes has been greatly depressed bythe extreme weight of taxation,(iii) In order to secure more money for defence other parts of the german economy, e.g., the railways, have been allowed to run down considerably !in efficiency owing to their inability to obtain funds for maintaining their equipment properly.  A similar state of things has not occurredyet in this country. - &apos;10. There is also, of course, the question how long Germany can continueto devote so much energy to armaments. Down to the time of Dr. Schachfsdisappearance Germany was pursuing a general economic policy which, in certain respects, could.be qualified as rather conservative. This appears no longer to be true. The recently published devices for paying for Government purchases in paper carrying taxation privileges in future years suggests an attempt to eattheir corn while it is green, but it is not clear that this is yet on a scale whichwould result in marked difficulties in raising taxes later on.. 11.   The above is the broad picture.   So far as it is possible to clothe it inthe form of statistics the attempt is made in the paragraphs which follow:12. There are two major difficulties in giving actual figures; viz., (a) nodetailed figures for State expenditure, whether On armaments or for civil purposeshave been published for several years, (b) only very incomplete figures for Stateborrowing are available. &apos; V&quot;:&apos;&apos;: :&apos;[r::r  13.   in-&apos; 1938-39 the reich received tax revenue of 17,091. million EM.( 1,106 millions) of which 2,000 million RM. ( 125 millions) was passed on to the &apos;States.  State and local taxation amounted to 4,900 million RM. ( 306,millions,).[19517j B2
Total taxation, reich, State and local was thus nearly 22,600 million-EM.*( 1,412 millions).The expenditure by the States and local authorities was 6,900 million EM.( 431 millions). What was the civil expenditure by the Reich, in addition to the2,000 million EM. granted to the States ? We only know that the corresponding-items for 1934 amounted to 5,590 million EM. ( 349 millions). We do not knowhow that figure may haVe varied, except that (1) the debt charge, which was500 million EM. in 1934, must surely have risen to 1,500 million EM., and(2) Austrian Civil expenditure has to be included. Perhaps the reich civil expenditure in 1938-39 was 7,500 million EM. ( 469 millions). Then total civil expenditure (reich, States, local) was 14,400t million EM. ( 900 millions),14. But we have also to allow for the fact that the contributions to theUnemployment Insurance were 1,600 million RM. ( 100 millions) in excess ofthe cost of unemployment relief. Such a surplus may appear later on in the formof State debt, but it is debt which does not have to be borrowed.15. The amount available for defence from borrowing is entirely obscure.Balogh, basing himself on results to October, considers that it may have reached11,000 million EM. for the year ( 688 millions). But some unknown part of this must have been borrowed for State financed investment (including partly thefour year plan investments), roads, canals, public buildings, &amp;c.The increase in the disclosed internal debt in the year 1938-39 was11,813 million EM. ( 738 millions), of which long term debt was,623 million EM. ( 477 millions). But we do not know how much of the longterm debt was new money and how much was funding of short term debt previouslyissued, the &quot; secret debt.&quot; The Germans decided at the beginning of 1938 to issueno more &quot;special &quot; bills. One would, naturally, presume that in such conditionsa good deal of the new long term debt was for funding, i.e., for providing moneyto pay off bills as they matured. Now the statistics of bills of all classes held by german banks show no decline but an increase of 5,400 million EM. betweenMarch 1938 and March 1939. A very considerable volume of special bills was,however, held outside the Banking system, and there is nothing to show these were not redeemed out of long term borrowing.On the whole the amount spent on defence out of borrowed money byGermany in 1938-39 is quite obscure. One is inclined to regard  600 millions(at 16 EM. to the  ) as the maximum. It may be a great deal lower. To call the figure  500 millions (i  100 millions) would allow for some funding andalso for some of the borrowing having been for non-defence purposes, but it is allquite speculative.16. We can now compare the German figures for 1938-39 with, say, ourown Defence arrangements for 1939-40 : United Kingdom.     Germany.As proposed      As guessed for1939-40. 1938-39.   i m.  m.

The figure for the yield of national revenue is the best attested of the lot, and if there is an error in the local revenue it would be balanced by acorresponding error in local expenditure.  The figures seem, to show that we are* c/. Balogh, International Affairs, March 1939, p. 232. He gives 22,000 million EM.,-f Balogh seems to make the civil expenditure in 1932 10,200 million EM., after allowing for say 1,000 million EM. spent on defence in that year. He carries this figure forward andmakes an allowance in the end of 2,000 to 4,000 million EM. for possible increases of local expenditure and also for reich borrowing for civil purposes. He does not refer specifically todebt charges or Austria.   Generally his figures seem far too low.$ These figures include a margin for supplementary estimates, but a preliminary examina-tion of the supplementaries threatened this July indicate a further great increase.
raising this year, say,  260 millions less than;Germany raised.last year. even so, as we have included our miscellaneous revenue while the German figures are for tax yield, the comparison is too favourable to us. The Nazi leaders have boastedof a further large rise in the yield of taxation this year-see paragraph 19 below.As regards the second item of profit on; unemployment insurance, we have nothing of the sort at present. Later on we may have. For:example, if theunemployed fell to 1,000,000, the Unemployment Fund might have, say, 30 millions a year more to invest.The figure for German civil expenditure is more doubtful than that oftaxation. If the  900 million figure is in error it is below the truth. It seems unlikely to the Treasury that the true figure could be above  1,000 millions.:The guess-work nature of the figure for German borrowing has been sufficiently brought out in paragraph 15 above.18. Nothing more can be claimed for the figures than that they confirm thegeneral impression that at the present time it is the heavier taxation in germany which is the important factor in enabling her to finance a bigger defence programme.19. It will be noticed that the above comparison is between the UnitedKingdom (1939/40) and Germany (1938/39). There are no available estimates for Germany (1939/40) except as regards Reich taxation. A Press report of a recent speech by Herr Reinhardt runs as follows :  &quot; Cost of Rearmament.In a speech to business men in Berlin to-day Herr Reinhardt, the StateSecretary at the Ministry of Finance, implicitly replied to criticisms of the taxation system.Herr Reinhardt said that the historic achievements of the Fiihrer,especially rearmament, and the &apos; Repatriation &apos; of Germans in Austria, theSudetenland, Bohemia, and Memel, had made even greater demands on Reichfinances than the preceding abolition of unemployment. Moreover, the securing and development of the vital rights of the Great German Reichwere only possible with strong armed forces. It had been said that the rearmament should have been spread over a greater number of years. &apos; Ibelieve that only a fool or an absolute enemy of the Reich would make thisassertion.&apos; Admittedly, the cost of rearmament would then have been lass and the cost of the western fortifications would not have arisen at all; on, the other hand, in all probability Germany would have had forced upon her/ last year a war which would have cost many times as much.In answer to the question frequently asked, &apos; Where is all the moneycoming from ? &apos; Herr Reinhardt pointed to the &apos; Constantly increasingfinancial strength of the Reich.&apos; Taxation revenue had risen from6,600,000,000 marks in 1932 to 17,700,000,000 m. in 1938 : in the current financial year it would probably rise to 22,000,000,000 m., and it would beeven higher in 1940. Five hundred million marks were obtained up to Marchof this year from the levy on Jewish fortunes.The method previously followed of financing the State&apos;s needs by short-or medium-term loans, which were afterwards converted into long-term loans,represented a charge on future tax revenue because the service and redemp-tion of the debt had to be met from taxation. Many milliards more could have been raised by loan, but the financial and political principle of NationalSocialism demanded other ways of financing deficits; also it was not desiredto close the capital market to private industry.In principle that part of the extraordinary expenditure of the Reichwhich could not be met from taxation would in future be covered only bythe issue of interest-bearing tax certificates. The tax certificates did not represent a further increase of the interest burden of the Reich but only a&apos; shifting &apos; of taxes which the Reich Budget was quite able to bear. As faras could be seen, the rising revenues of the Reich would render unnecessaryin 1940 the issue of interest-bearing tax certificates on the same scale as in1939.&quot;..,^Herr Reinhardt could only be giving estimates based on the experience oftwo or three months of the new financial year. But if, indeed,, the yield oftaxation for the Reich alone in 1939-40 will be 22 milliards, an increase of
4-3 milliards ( 269 millions) over 1938-39, the implications are staggering. Itis not so much that it gives them more to spend on armaments, because, as isobvious and as Reinhardt says, their borrowing must be coming down. But it means that they have over  880 millions a year for defence without borrowingagainst our  247 millions, and unless their Budget breaks down they can keep it up indefinitely. If the calculations are  100 millions or even  200 millionswrong an enormous disparity still remains between the United Kingdom and theGerman figures.20. The following is an analysis of German tax revenue for the year1938-39:-Income tax On wagesOn salaries ...Other...............Corporation tax ...Other direct and miscellaneous taxes ...Turnover tax     ...      ...      ...      ...Customs   ...Other  taxes  on   consumption   (includingtraffic tax)   ...      ...      ...Total       .........railwayMillions of Marks.6401,4513,2612,4081,5943,3571,8183,16217,691In the British tax system the proportion of income tax derived from wages is negligible. We may compare the whole British income tax and surtax with theGerman tax on incomes other than wages. The German tax on wages, togetherwith the turnover tax, customs and taxes on consumption, may then be comparedwith our indirect taxes.  The following comparison results : Germany (1938-39).Millions ofMarks.

Unfortunately, there is no reliable estimate of the british national income for comparison; perhaps it is  4,500 millions. The preliminary,estimate of the German national income for 1938 is 77 milliards. With Austriathe total is likely to be well above 80 milliards ( 5,000 millions).21. The most striking results of the above comparison of tax yields are(1) the very heavy burden on the working classes in Germany, (2) the heavyGerman corporation tax (40 per cent, of company profits), and (3) the relativelymodest yield of income tax and other direct taxes.The turnover tax, it is true, falls not only on the working classes, but onall incomes. But the same applies to customs and excise duties in both countries,and the income tax on wages in Germany is more definitely a working class impostthan the indirect taxes in Great Britain. Local taxation in Germany has been estimated at 5 milliards (nearly  300 millions), and compares with about 210 millions in Great Britain.  Contributions from employers and employed for  
health and unemployment insurance, &amp;g., amount in Germany to no less than5,273 milliards, or  330 millions (twelve months to June 1938). For GreatBritain in 1936 they were only  110 millions, and are probably still under  120millions.III. German Imports.22. The Treasury were asked for a note about the recent increase in Germanimports as shown by the tables compiled by Sir George Schuster and recently published in the &quot; Economist.&quot;These tables were tables of volume, and the increase is largely explained bythe lower cost of food and raw materials.The following table shows the imports in certain years in millions ofmarks : -19131929193319371938TotalImports.10,77013,4474,2045,4685,398Eaw materials and half-finishedgoods.6,2807,2052,4203,2952,890Food and drink.2,8083,8231,0821,4851,998Imports of raw materials and half-finished goods fell from over 7,000 million marks in 1929 to under 3,000 million marks in 1938. The world gold price index for 1938 is 45-4 per cent, of that for 1929. If that can be applied to german imports the 2,890 millions of marks of 1938 would buy as much as6,360 millions in 1929.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,July 3, 1939.

The War Chest.THE recent development of events particularly the growth of the defence programme and the persistent demand for loans and credits from foreigncountries: has added to the problem of finding money for defence a new anxietyas to our ability to defend the   and to continue to purchase vital necessitiesfrom abroad, both in&apos;present conditions if they continue, and, above all, in war.2. Ordinarily imports are paid for by exports or else by gold or the saleof foreign assets. When the balance of trade is adverse as it is now, bothincreased foreign purchases for defence and equally loans to foreign countriesinvolve within a brief space a loss of gold.3. The present policy is increasing the pressure on the exchange in threeways.Armaments made at home for ourselves involve the import of raw materials from abroad equal probably on average to 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, of the valueof the orders, and in these times possibly more.Armaments purchased from abroad absorb gold.Loans and credits to foreign countries, if expended on the purchase of goodsin this country, involve imports on the average of 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, ormore of the money so expended; if taken abroad, in the long run they add in&quot;whole to our gold losses.4. Fifteen months ago our gold stock was over  800 million. It lookedimposing, but, in fact, gave a rather misleading appearance of strength. It hadbeen accumulated in some considerable measure owing to the transfer to london of fugitive short money. In less than 15 months of international tension nearly40 per cent, of our gold stock has disappeared.5. The reasons for our gold loss of over  300 million in 15 months (only part of the figures published)  ifg  is follows : 6. The economic set-back in 1937 profoundly disturbed Avorld conditions,the effect being especially marked among the best customers of our export trade.7. A great deal of fugitive French money has returned to France; to that extent our loss is France&apos;s gain.8.   The balance Of our trade is adverse, but the essential point for sterlingis the aggregate balance of trade of the sterling bloc which banks in London.   It[19547] b
is estimated that for a period of 18 months to December last the sterling balancesheld in London by countries of the sterling bloc were falling at the rate of some 80 million a year.9. These economic factors leading to a depletion of our gold stocks havebeen reinforced by the effect of political conditions, A great deal of fugitivemoney in London has been transferred by foreigners to the United States or othersupposedly safe countries, and probably there is a small trickle of British invest-ments to the United States, though the amount is not significant.10.   War preparations have played a part and will play a much greater partin determining the fate of our gold reserves : Diversion of activities from peaceful enterprise to war preparation leads to a decline in exports, and the intensification of the defence plans leads to anincrease in imports, especially of raw materials, but in some cases also ofcompleted goods from the United States. -War preparation has come to includethe giving of loans or grants to foreign countries on a large scale.11. The limit of commercial export credits has recently been increased&apos; from 50 millions to  75 millions, and the amount of the credits actually granted hasincreased very greatly in recent months. Sound short-term commercial creditscertainly resulting in repayment in not more than two or three years are not sovery harmful, but medium and long-term credits are harmful, particularly ifrepayment is uncertain.Included in these credits are  10 millions for Russia, more than half of whichis unspent, and  10 millions for Turkey, of which  2 millions is already beingspent.12. It is unfortunate that at a time when we shall clearly have to cut downcapital expenditure in this country needed to maintain the standard of living weshould have committed ourselves to finance capital expenditure for the develop-ment and industrialisation of other countries.13. Apart from these commercial credits, there is a further  6 millions for turkey,  4 millions net for Czecho-Slovakia,  5 millions for China, a probable 30 millions for India (Army re-equipment).14. Existing commitments in respect of &quot; political export credits &quot; to various countries amount to  19 millions, plus interest, and suggestions from government Departments for new promises under this head to cover the cases ofPoland, New Zealand, Turkey, Roumania, &amp;c, and to give a margin for furtherapplications, bring the total to  60 millions, plus interest, which will appear ina Bill about to be introduced.15. The Polish Government, in fact, asked for  60 millions; New Zealandis in difficulties and needs new money both for defence and for other purposes;Roumania and Turkey are both asking for more.16. The following measures have been taken to protect the exchange. Thevalue of sterling has been let down from 5 dollars to 4-68. The embargo onforeign issues has been greatly tightened up. A very large bloc of gold has beentransferred from the Bank of England to the Exchange Equalisation account for use in active defence. Sweeping measures to discourage and impede specula-tion have been taken.17. Very little more could be done even with the most far-reaching powers.A further small depreciation of the   would be ineffective; a large depreciation,even if it were on balance desirable, is not at present practical politics.18. Up to the present the&apos; disadvantage of our gold loss has been largelypolitical.  It must discourage our friends and encourage the Axis Powers.If it continues swiftly it will soon become also a serious economic anxietyeven in peace. But the greatest anxiety is that it may gravely affect our stayingpower in war, Our gold stock, together with such.assets as we may be able to sellor mortgage in wartime to countries overseas, constitutes our sole war chest. H19. The amount of our requirements of foreign exchange in a war of longduration defies calculation. We shall require food and raw materials and maybearmaments in great quantities.   What exports we can sell, and to whom, to
offset the imports, is uncertain. It is uncertain, too, to what extent our allies will be financially dependent on us (though it is prima facie unlikely that russia would require financing in a new war to the extent that she did in the Great War).20. The only prudent conclusion is that we ought to preserve the largestwar chest possible. To-day that chest contains some  200 million of foreign securities which we could hope to sell or mortgage, and  500 million of goldrapidly diminishing.21. The contrast between this and our war-chest at the beginning of theGreat War is as follows.22. On the one hand our gold stock is for the present much in excess of thatin 1914.23. On the other hand, in 1914 by stopping foreign lending we could, other things being equal, improve our buying power by some  200 millions a year.To-day there is no foreign lending and our revenue account is  50 million a yearto the bad.24. In 1914 we recalled some  50 million short money invested abroad;to-day much short money invested in London can be withdrawn from us.25. In the Great War we requisitioned and sold abroad some  200 million of foreign securities apart from private sales abroad which were probablyconsiderable. To-day we can by requisitioning obtain  200 million of foreign securities and hope to sell these, but no more.26. In the Great War we did not need to attempt to sell blocks of sterlingsecurities. In the next war, though we could try to do so, the possibility of successon more than a very small scale is exceedingly doubtful.27. As regards foreign borrowing in war, the contrast with our position inthe Great War is as follows : 28. In the Great War we borrowed  250 million from private investorsabroad (mostly U.S.A.) all of which was repaid and we borrowed  840 million from the United States Government (not repaid). To-day under the Johnson Actwe cannot borrow in the United States either privately or from the Government.29. Nevertheless, unless, when the time comes the United States are pre-pared either to lend or to give us money as required, the prospects for a long war are becoming exceedingly grim.30. It has already been pointed out that it is impossible to frame estimates of the rate at which our resources in gold and foreign securities might be drawn on in the event of war. At the rate,  20 million a month, at which we have beenusing gold, our reserves would barely last three years and considering theincreased demands likely in war, this estimate of the period is very likely much too optimistic.II. Money for Defence.31. The Cabinet review of February, 1938, allotted for defence in 1939,1940 and 1941, roughly  1,000 million.This had grown by September 1938 to roughly  1,100 million.Subsequent additions, for most but not all of which rough estimates havebeen given by the Defence Departments, may be put broadly at  1,000 million.Present rough total for three years,  2,100 million.32.   A division between years may be guessed as follows :   million.1939       ...      ...      ......      ...      ...      750;    1940       ...............      ...      7001941..................      650[The figure now estimated to be required in 1939 exceeds by  120 million thefigure mentioned in the Budget speech in April.][19547] &quot; is 2
33. On the basis of existing taxation, allowing on an optimistic basis forestimated increases of yield and some favourable factors affecting the capital account, the balance of expenditure to be found somehow may be guessed asfollows : &apos;1939    ......       ......       ...        500 million or a little less1940    ...      ......      ......       360 million1941    ................        330 million or rather less34. In 1939, but not in subsequent years,  150 million or thereabouts can beborrowed on Treasury Bills, leaving, say,  350 million to be borrowed on long ormiddle term.35. The foregoing figures are far beyond anything that can be borrowed byordinary means without inflation.36. One remedy lies in increased taxation. The Cabinet note of April laston the growth of Civil Expenditure showed that between 1925 and 1938 the yield of increases in taxation amounting to  245 million enabled us to provide 153 million more for defence. In 1939  24 million new taxes were added, butthe additional amount for defence was lowered to  125 milllion.Additional taxation, totalling on a full-year basis some  280 million, has been secured by *Increasing income tax and supertax by roughly 40 per cent.Increasing tobacco duty by 40 per cent.Increasing estate duties by roughly 20 per cent.New oil duty at Qd. a gallon-New tariff duties.Many minor changes, including, e.g., 25 per cent, increase on privatemotor duties and much heavier increases of duties on commercial vehicles.37. There must be some limit to new increases of taxation in peace if anyelasticity is to be left over for war, when the yield of many customs and excise duties will cease or greatly fall and collection of direct taxes may in the initial stages be greatly delayed.     y38. Suppose by way of illustration that in the Budget of 1940 taxation is increased by  100 million (e.g., by a Budget of new taxes similar to the lastBudget, plus Is. extra on the income tax).The requisite borrowing would then be 1939 :  500 million, of which  150 million would be by Treasury Billsand  350 million on long or middle term.1940 :  260 million.1941 :  230 million or rather less.39. These figures, which take no account of concurrent requirements ofmoney for loans to foreigii-cauntries (and equally take&quot;no account of Dominionana&quot; municipal borrowings), are up to, if not beyond and in the case of thecurrent year are certainly beyond the limit of what can be borrowed out of savings by ordinary means.40.   In the course of time, therefore, and may be a short time, it is likelyto be necessary to contemplate a variety of controls, especially-Prohibition of new issues.Control of advances by Banks.Control of advances by Building Societies.aJj^I      Control of Companies&apos; dividends and investment of their reserves.f     I       Possibly also control of prices.These matters are accordingly being studied at the present time.41. It has so far been assumed that the programme would end in April1942. There must at best be an overlap. Even when the normal cost of main-tenance is reached, it is likely to require (including the service of the new debt)some  450 million per annum, a figure unattainable on anything resembling thepresent scale of taxation.
III. Conclusions.42. Apart from increased taxation, the following means of arresting thegeneral deterioration suggest themselves : 43. The primary need is to conserve our resources in gold and foreign exchange, which represent staying power in war,44. Inflation, with the gold losses it would involve (apart from its otherevils), must be avoided. Very heavy increases of taxation are in prospect, and inthe course of time general controls are likely to become necessary and the standardof living must be directly or indirectly affected.45. Purchases abroad of armaments must be avoided to the greatest extent possible. Further expenditure on armaments in this country cannot beundertaken without counting the cost in gold. Indeed, as there is a prospect ofthe continuance of the present armed peace, if not of the outbreak of war, finalityof expenditure (unless for overmastering reasons) should now be declared.46. If nevertheless substantial new expenditures are contemplated, theCabinet should be provided not only with estimates of cost, but so far as possible with estimates of the extra strain involved upon the exchanges.47. In any lengthy war there are types of food and of vital raw materials,the acquisition of which from overseas is essential to our continued existence.It is for consideration whether, bearing in mind the possible lack of means offoreign payment in war, the enhanced prices and the difficulty of carriage inwar and the possible losses at sea, the process of acquiring stores of suchessentials (now standing in the case of a variety of special minerals, &amp;c, requiredfor war at about six months&apos; war requirements), where they are durable and capable of safe storage, should not be carried further in spite of the immediategold losses which that course involves.48. Loans to foreign countries, specially loans not to be expended in thiscountry, must be restricted to the lowest possible limits. The point to be borne in mind here is that every new commitment of this character definitely reduces the period for which we shall be able to finance war.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,July 3, 1939.
