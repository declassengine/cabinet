THE INTER-national situation.Rus s ia.(previous reference:Cabinet 37(39), Con-clusion 1,)ER. 37(3^) 5.1. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said-thet the Cabinet would have seen the latesttelegram from Sir William Seeds (Telegram No. 165from Moscow) .    The French Government had been anxious that a reply should be sent to our ambassador   in Moscow on the previous evening,but he (the Foreign Secretary) had said that itwas necessary to wait until today.   He suggestedthat the present position of the negotiations should be considered at a Meeting of the ForeignPolicy Committee which would be held immediately on the conclusion of the Cabinet Meeting.Two main points emerged, from. Sir Villiara Seeds&apos;telegram.   The first was that the Russians did not like our formula, in regard to &quot;indirect aggress ion&quot;-,which they thought did not  cover enough ground,and were determined to adhere to their own formula.In our view, this formula would give the SovietGovernment a wide right of intervention in theinternal affairs of other countries, and we could,not justify acceptance of it.The second, point concerned Article 6.    TheSoviet Government still adhered to their viewthat while the Articles of the Political Agreement-would be initialled, they should not enter intoforce until a Military Agreement had been concluded.   The French had been anxious to concedethis point at once.    The Foreign Secretary&apos;ajviewwas that- he would be prepared to make a concession on this point in exchange for the Soviet Governmentaccepting our view on the definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot; to be included in Article 1.   He wouldalso be prepared to agree to a provision for     ____consultation in regard to cases which, in the view

of the Soviet Government, cjo^tri1ruted^In4irac.taggression but which were not covered by ourformula.The Foreign Secretary said that if theRussians wer* not prepared to accept an arrange-ment on the lines proposed, then the only alterna-tive to a complete breakdown of the negotiations would he the conclusion of a simple tripartitepact.    Tf the negotiations should, after all,fail, the Foreign Secretary said that this wouldnot cause him. veiy great anxiety, since he feltthat, whatever formal agreement was signed, theSoviet Government woul^ probably take such action as best suited them if war broke out.The Foreign Secretary added that he had had along talk with Wr Greenwood and. Dr. Dalton, towhom he had explained the position.   He found thatthey were entirely in accord with our attitude inregard to the definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot;.He was not, therefore, apprehensive of parliamentary criticism if we were to break with the Soviet-Government on this point.Asked as to the prospects of reaching agreement on the basis of a simple tripartite pact, theForeign Secretary said that he was rather disposed tothink that the Soviet Government were not very keenon concluding an agreement of any kind.In reply to questions, the Foreign secretary said that he thought there was some evidence thatGermany was trying to make matters as difficult for us as they could in our negotiations with theSoviet Union.    It seemed that discussions of some kind were proceeding between the German Government

1 O iand the Soviet Government.   It was impossible to assess their real value, but it seemed likely thatthese discussions related to industrial matters.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could, not bringhimself to believe that a real alliance between russia and Germany was possible.The Cabinet  (l) Took note of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs&apos; statement:(S) Agreed, that the lines of the replyto be sent to Sir William Seeds should,be settled at a Meeting of the ForeignPolicy Committee to be held immediately on the conclusion of the Cabinet Meeting,-3-

THE INTER-NAT TONALSITUATION(Conf d) .The position at Tientsin.(previous reference:Cabinet 3 7(39), Con-elusion 3 .)F.R.     (3^)4.2.  THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOR-MGN--AFFAIR&amp;sa.id that his colleagues would have seen therecent telegrams from Sir Robert Craigie, reportinghis discussions with the Japanese Minister forForeign Affairs (Telegrams Nos . 786 to 790&apos;from Tokyo),1together with the reply which had been sent tohim (Telegram No. 387).     It had been arranged that Sir Robert Craigie should, see Mr Arita again at 9 a.m. that morning.The Foreign Office melegram had been drafted in order to allow Sir Robert Craigie, who, hethought, had conducted the negotiations with considerable skill, some room for manoeuvre.In reply to a question, the Foreign secretary said, that he would take steps to make certain thatthe United States Government were aware of thegeneral lines on which we were acting..   He wasboun^ to say, however, that the attitude of theUnited States Government in this matter had notbeen very helpful,The Cabinet took note of theForeign Secretary&apos;s statement.-4-

INTERNATIONALiTUATION (CONT*L)(previous reference:Cabinet 37(39)Conclusion 2. )3. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that some information had been received tothe effect that Germany was &quot;soft pedalling&quot; inregard to Danzig.      It was difficult to know how much value should be attached to this information or what it denoted.      It was clear, however, thatour right course was to show a firm front,while not excluding the possibilities of adjustment.The Foreign Secretary invited attentionto a recent telegram from our Ambassador in Germany(Telegram No. 320 from Berlin) in which sir Nevile Henderson said that in his opinionfurther public warnings as to Danzig were undesirable.Reference was also made to a recent discussion betweenHerr von Dirksen and the Egyptian Ambassador inLondon (vide Despatch from Viscount Halifax toSir Miles Lampson, No. 792, dated 17th July.).The Cabinet took note of this statement.

POLAND.Proposals fora Cash Loan to.(previous reference:Cabinet 37 (39)Conclusion 9)4.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that it had been contemplated that a financial agreement would be signed the previous week, but atthe last moment the Poles had not been willing to sign, with the result that a rather difficult situation had arisen.     The Chancellor of theExchequer and he had spent the previous afternoon in further discussions with the Polish representative.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatwe \vere prepared to, take the very unusual step ofmaking a cash loan to Poland.     It was obvious thatwe must take steps to ensure that the money lentshould not be used iijt such a way as to damage our interests, which would, for example, be the case ifthe Poles were at once to convert sterling proceeds of the loan into dollars and place orders in theUnited States.     It was therefore reasonable toprovide for consultation between the French, Britishand Polish Governments as to the; methods of spendingthe proceeds of the loan.      The United States had adopted the same procedure when she had made loans to us in the last war.     He thought that the difficulty which had arisen was largely due to a difference ofopinion between the Polish Minister of Finance and his representative in this oouritry.     The French were incomplete agreement with us on the whole matter.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed out that ifwe were to make the loan to Poland, it would benecessary for Poland to reach agreement with us in thenear future, while there was still time for us to obtainthe necessary legislative authority from Parliament...The Cabinet took note of this statement.

jgS INTERNATIONALITUATION.Italian Relationswith Prance.(previous reference:Cabinet 33 (39)Conclusion 4).5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that Sir Eric Phipps had now spoken toM. Daladier on the subject of a possible French,approach to Signor Mussolini with a view toeffecting an improvement in Italian relationswith Fyance, and clearing up outstanding difficulties.M. Daladier had undertaken to consider the matterbut his response had not been very encouraging.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

TTHE international situation (CONT&apos;D)VRelations betv/eenprance and Spain.(previous reference:Cabinet 33 (39)Conclusion 5. )6.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that his colleagues would have seen from a recent telegram (No. 429 from San Sebastian) thatthere had been a last minute hitch over the handing-over of the gold from France to Spain, to which theFrench were now attaching conditions.      A telegram had been despatched to the French Government on theprevious night  (No.  350 Saving) urging them very strongly to reconsider their attitude in this matter.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

THE international situation (OONT&apos;D).Turkey.(Previous Reference;Cabinet 54(39),Conclusion 9).^.s^(3^)/o.7. THE SECRETLY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAERSsaid that his colleagues would have seen a recenttelegram from Turkey (No. 12, from Angora) fromwhich it appeared that the Turkish Governmentwere asking for financial assistance on a farlarger scale than we had contemplated.    the tone of the Turkish demands was somewhatdisconcerting, although he doubted if it wentso far as to make the conclusion of a political agreement dependent on our conceding theirmonetary demands.    The matter was further explained in a letter from the Ambassador which he proposedto circulate to the Cabinet.    He would probablyfind it necessary to ask the Cabinet for decisions on this matter before long.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

PALESTINE-8. THE SECR,:2PAHY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat the Permanent Mandates Commission had sent himReport of a draft of their report, whish took the form ofPermanent     .Mandates &quot;observations&quot;, followed by minutes of their privateC oramission.(previous discussions.       It was clear that four members ofReference:Cabinet 34(39J   the Commission thought that the Government&apos;s policy,Conclusion4), as set out in the White Paper, was not consistent with the Terms of the Mandate, while three memberstoek a contrary view.    The points at issue were notargued in the &quot;observations&quot;.   The arguments, as stated in the minutes, were not well expressed, andthe Secretary of State thought that a very strong casecould be made against the view of the four members who thought our policy inconsistent with the Termsof the Mandate.    ^on ^x-ample-?  ^hey^urged that we had since 1937 adopted a new interpretation of our obligations under the Mandate.    They had based them-selves, however, on a mis-quotation of our StatementOf Policy, made in 1937 (Cra3.* 5513).    The Permanent Man-dates Commission had asked far our comments on their draft &quot;observations&quot;,,    These were being prepared and wouldbe brought before the Cabinet Committee on Palestine.In the discussion which ensued, questions were asked as to what the position would be if theGouncil of the League of Nations failed to reach a unanimous decision on this point.    The Secretary ofState for the Colonies expressed the hope that,although a number of members of the Council mightnot be in agreement with our policy,  they might refrain

from voting against uscThe view was expressed that it would he desirable to obtain an opinion from the legal adviser to the Foreign Office as to what the positionwould be in the various situations which might arise when the matter came before the Council of theLeague.    This course was agreed to,A suggestion was also made that there was alikelihood that some members of the Council wouldbe actively canvassed by Jewish sympathisers beforethe Council meeting and that it would be desirablethat a diplomatic approach should be made to certain countries represented on the   Council, before thenext Council meeting.       The -Secretary of State forthe colonies said that this matter was under con-sideration and that material was being prepared foruse through the diplomatic channel0THE SECR..,T.uRY OP STaTE POR DOMINION affairs suggested that if   we commented fully on the permanent mandates Commissions draft &quot;observations&apos;&apos;, theresult might only be to enable them to strengthen the case which they had it in mind to submit to theCouncil of the League of Nations,    The Secretary ofState for the colonies said that the possibility ofnot sending any comments on the-Commissionfsobservations had occurred to him.    This possibility would be brought to the notice of the PalestineCommittee.Illegal THE SECRETARY OF alATE FOR THE COLONIESImmigration-said that he had authorised the High

Commissioner for Palestine to announce that therewould he no immigration quota for the six months from 1stOctober, 1939 to 31st March, 1940 on account of thelarge inflow of illegal immigrants.      This decisionfollowed from the statement in the White Paper that wecontemplated a total of 75,000 immigrants over a periodof five years, and that illegal immigrants would be deducted from this total.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat when the quota of 7,500 had been fixed for thecurrent period of six months, he had told the jewish agency that,  if they could produce evidence that itwould he possible for Palestine to receive a larger number, he would be prepared to consider a supplementaryquota.        No case for any addition to the quota of ,500 had been made to him-At the present time illegal immigrants wereentering Palestine in such large numbers as to make itImpossible to authorise a quota for the ensuing sixmonths.To a small extent the illegal immigrantsconsisted of persons who avoided our patrols, whichhad not yet reached their maximum efficiency.    For themost part, however,  the illegal immigrants consisted of persons who were intercepted by our patrols, butwhom it was in fact impossible to send away.      Manyof the illegal immigrants came from Germany, and itwas impossible to contemplate sending them back tothat country.        Others came from countries such asPoland, Roumania and Hungary, but had taken steps to destroy their papers    Since no proof could be obtained ofthe place from which they came,  there was no means ofdeporting them.

The continuance of illegal immigration on this scale was having a serious effect on Arab public,opinion.      The Arabs were coming to believe that ourWhite Paper policy was insincere and that we proposedto allow the Jews to circumvent that policy bybreaches of the law at which we connived.      It had,therefore, been necessary that a clear statement should he made which would reassure Arab opinion.  Sofar as the Arabs were concerned the High Commissioner^announcement had produced a wholly good effect.    Theeffect on the Jews was more doubtful.      If it wouldpersuade them that we were not prepared to agree toour policy being stultified its effect would be good.Again,illegal immigration did not secure the righttype or the right numbers of immigrants for theeconomic needs of the country.      It was therefore tohe hoped that the Jews would co-operate with us in a determined step to stop illegal immigration.On the other hand, the Jews might take theView that if there was to be no immigration exceptillegal immigration they had better encourageillegal immigration.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat the decisive consideration was that no party would have any confidence in our policy if we allowedthat policy to be destroyed by illegal immigration.      Drastic steps were, therefore,necessary to put a stop to it.    These steps comprised,fJrst

action in the countries from which the illegal immigrants came;    this would he taken inco-operation with the Foreign Office.Secondly, action in Palestine to deal withillegal immigrants on arrival.      There was,for example, the possibility that they mightbe kept in camps and not allowed to enterPalestine.      This matter would be brought before the Cabinet Committee on Palestine.The Cabinet:(l) Took note that the observations of the Permanent MandateCommission would be brought before the Cabinet Committee on palestine with a view to con-sideration of the terms of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments reply.(2) Invited the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to arrangefor the preparation of a Paper,setting out the various con-contingencies which might arise when the Report of the permanent mandates Commission on our policyin Palestine came before theCouncil of the League of Nations.(3) Invited the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for theColonies to arrange for diplomatic action to be taken, with a viewto obtaining support for ourPalestine policy when the mattercame before the Council of theLeague of Nations.(4) Took note that the position inregard to illegal immigration,and the action to be taken to diminish it, would be brought before the Cabinet Committee on palestine.(The First Lord of the Admiralty left theMeeting at this point.)

jhE MERCHANDISE        9. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum byfeRKS ACT, 1926.the President of the Board of Trade (CP. -154 (39))proposed amendment, in which he sought the authority of his colleagues fox1the preparation, and submission to the Committee of(previous reference: Home Affairs, of a short Bill to amend the MerchandiseCabinet 39(37), Con- Marks Act, 1926.elusion 22).Section 10 of that Act, which required an indication of origin to be applied to imported goods,provided that this indication should consist, at the option of the person applying it,  of either the word&quot;Foreign&quot; or &quot;Empire&quot;, as the case might be, or of adefinite indication of the country in which the goods were manufactured or produced.      The object of theproposed Bill was to remove the existing option to use the word &quot;Foreign&quot; or &quot;Empire&quot;, and to requiregoods covered by the Act to be marked with the nameof the country whence they originated.      There had been considerable pressure in favour of this change both inthe House of Commons and from other quarters and it hadalready been announced in the House of Commons that the option was to be removed.     Provisions would, of course,be included in the Bill to safeguard traders againstloss or undue inconvenience in connection with stocksmarked in accordance with the existing law, and to dealwith the obvious difficulties of marking blended goods.It was. stated in the Memorandum that theprincipal commercial, industrial and agricultural interests   had been consulted by the President of theBoai-d of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, and that, although some divergence ofopinion existed between manufacturing interests on theone hand and importers and merchants on the other, it&quot;was not anticipated that opposition to the change wouldbe very weighty.

THE PRESIDENT OP IHE BOARD OP TRADE said thatthere had been a movement for some tiae in favour of theremoval of the option referred to.^ and that he was satisfied that the change proposed had a sufficienthacking from public opinion to justify its being made.For the moment, he only asked for authority for the drafting of the Bill and for its submission to theCommittee of Home Affairs.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat if the option to use the word &quot;foreign&quot; or torequire the goods to be marked with the name of thecountry from whence they originated was to be removed,it was logical to take the same step in regard toEmpire goods.     Some apprehension was felt that this might prejudice the trade of some of the smallerand lesser known colonies.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thoughtthat this difficulty could be got over if the word&quot;Empire&quot; was prefixed to the name of the smaller orlesser known colonies.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that some time ago enquiries    had been addressedto the Dominion Governments on this matter.      He hopedthat it would not be necessary to introduce the bill before their replies had been received.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE saidthat early introduction of the Bill was not contemplated.The Cabinet authorised the President ofthe Board of Trade to prepare and submit to the Committee of Home Affairs ashort; Bill to amend the Merchandise MarksAct, 1926, on the lines indicated in his ____Memorandum,

0 o &quot;iL U iPREVENTIONOP VIOLENCE(TEMPORARY! ^PROVISIONS)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 35 (39)Conclusion 10. )10.      The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Home Secretary (H.A.. 31 (39)covering the draft Prevention of Violence (temporary provisions) Bill, the object of which was to preventthe commission in Great Britain of further acts of violence designed to influence public opinion or government policy with respect to Irish affairs:together with the following Conclusions thereon bythe Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.C. 17th Conclusions(39) Minute l):-&quot;(l)    That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should be invited to communicate the substance of the Bill to Mr. de valera with as little delay as practicable,in order that his comments may be obtained,if possible, before the Meeting of theCabinet on Wednesday next, July 19th.(3)    To recommend the Cabinet to authorisethe introduction forthwith in the Houseof Commons, with a view to its passage into law before the summer recess, ofthe Prevention of Violence (temporary provisions) Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A. 31 (39), subject to the alterations and modifications agreed upon in the course of the Commit tee&apos;s discussion,and to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable.,fTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat the preparation of this Bill had given rise toa number of novel and important points.It had been suggested in certain quartersthat the matter should be dealt with by proclaimingthe I.R.A. as an illegal organisation.      Thissuggestion, however, did not get over the difficultyof how membership of the organisation could be proved.Another suggestion was to rely on a visasystem between Great Britain and Ireland.     Oninvestigation, however, the conclusion had beenreached that a visa system would not be workableunless the effective co-operation of the Eire Policewas obtained.     It was thought that the prospects of

obtaining such co-operation would he diminished if wewere to set up a Visa Office in Dublin.Another proposal which had been considered wasto set up internment camps in this country.     It was recognised that, in the last resort, we might be driven to adopt this course.     It was clear, however, that&amp;GMF&amp;g e&amp;^m* internment camps was open to many weightyobjections.These alternatives having been discarded, ithad been decided to adopt the scheme on which the bill was based.     One of the main powers in the Bill, onwhich reliance was placed, was the power of expulsion andprohibition of entry in respect of -persons who had beenordinarily resident in Great Britain for less than10 years.      The Police would like to extend the limit of10 years, but it was clear that even with this limitthese powers would cover two-thirds of the suspectedpersons.      On the whole, it had been thought wise to restrict   these powers to persons who had been ordinarily resident here for less than 10 years.The second main power in the Bill was the powerto require suspects to register.      This power was not limited to persons who had been ordinarily residenthere for 10 years.,      The Police attached considerable importance to this power, which would give them some holdover suspected persons who could not be made the subjectof Expulsion or Prohibition Orders.

- 2-03Very c areful -consider ajxlonjaad--been^gi ven-*&quot;fcothe question whether it was wise to set. up anAppeal Tribunal either of an advisory or of a judicial..character.    The conclusion had beenreached that such a Tribunal would be either an obstacle to the authorities, or else be a piece ofhumbug, and that on the whole it was be-tter not toset up a Tribunal.    The Advisory Tribunal whichhad been set up to deal with the deportation of aliens had in fact served no useful purpose, andhad fallen into disuseoThe Bill was limited in scope.    Thus., it was for a period of two years only? and proposals toextend the provisions of the Bill to restrict the immigration.of labour into Scotland had beenresisted.The Home Secretary said that he had discussed tue matter with Mr. Greenwood andSir Archibald Sinclair..    In his talks he had notdisguised the extent of the powers asked for,and he had taken the line that the Bill was anessential Defence measure, which was necessary toput a stop to sabotage.    He had emphasised thefact that evidence showed that a further campaign of outrages was contemplated in which life wouldbe endangered.    Both Mr. Greenwood and Sir archibald sinclair had taken the proposal well, although theformer had said that he could not guarantee what,attitude his Party would adopt.A copy of the Bill had been shown by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs toMtVDulanty.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he had explained the Bill to Mr. Dulanty-,-who had not takon the matter tragically.    He had-19-

- asXedQjL^-^he^of this evil, namely, the partition of Ireland.    On thi.gno hopes had been held out to him.    A copy of the bill had been sent to Mr. De Valera.In the discussion which ensued, trie main point raised was the provision which limited the application ofExpulsion and Prohibition Orders to persons who had notbeen ordinarily resident in Great Britain during the last10 years.THE HOME SECRETARY agreed that this limitation madea gap in the logic of the Bill*      The question was ho?/ far it was wise to go0    Originally it had been proposed to have a limit of five-years a     This had been increased first to sevenand then to ten. years0 But it had been felt that itmight not be possible to adhere to this latter limit.    Aten years&apos; limit would enable some 50 or SO out of the80 people whom the Police regarded as dangerous, to beexpelled from this country.    lie proposed, as soon as the .Bill had been passed, to pick out those cases acong these50 or 60 on which we should be on the strongest ground withMr. De Valera, and to make the men in question the subjects of Expulsion Orders.    He attached a great deal of import&quot;-&apos;ance to getting Mr. De Valera&apos;s co-operation, and hethought that we were more likely to obtain it if we didnot ask him to receive in Eire persons whom he could claimhad had no connection with that country for a very longtime.    There was also the question of what view parliament would take if it was proposed to apply the expulsion pro- ..cedure to persons who had been resident in this country for very long periods and who would claim that they no longerhad any connection with Ireland.On the other. JbbmV the view was expressed thatit was difficult to justify the limitation of .Expulsion and Prohibition Orders to personsordinarily resident in this country for less than .

10 years, seeing that we were taking^ theline- -thatthe danger to which we were exposed was a very graveone and Justified the use of drastic powers.(The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs left the Cabinet at this point).THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was struckby the point that one-third of the suspected personshad been in this country for 10 years or more-This left a large gap.One suggestion made was that the     powers should apply to persons who had been ordinarily resident in Great Britain since the end of the War(say, 1918), or the establishment of the FreeState (1st April, 1922).      The view which met with most acceptance was that the figure of 1110&quot; in clause 1(2) and 1(4) should be raised to &quot;20&quot;, butthat, in making use of the powers of expulsion, care should be taken not to ask the Eire G-overnment toreceive persons whom they could, reasonably claimhad no connection with Eire.General agreement was expressed with theHome secretary view that internment was adesperate remedy and should not be adopted unlessevery other expedient failed.THE HOME SECRETARY explained,  in answer to questions, that at the outset he had been disposed to insert a provision for a visa system.   &quot; ThePolice -authorities, however, had been of the opinionthat such a system was not very likely to be effective.      Further, it would give rise to serious

Opposition in Northern Ireland.     He had thereforeoome to the conclusion that no provision shouldhe made for a visa system, at any rate at the outset.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER raised thequestion whether the limitation of Expulsion andProhibi tion Orders to persons who had not beenordinarily resident in Great Britain for a certainperiod,  should apply to (a) a period of 10 (now 20)years at the tfrae&quot; of the Secretary of State&apos;sexercise of his powers under the Act, or (b) to aperiod of 10 (now 20) years at the date of thepassing of the Bill.       Jt was generally felt thatthe latter alternative   was preferable, and that itmight be desirable to  move a Government amendment in Committee on the lines   indicated.After further   discussion,  the Cabinet(l)   approved the draft  ^Prevention of violence (Temporary&apos; Provisions) Billin the form annexed   to H.A.31(39),subject to the substitution of &quot;20&quot;years for &quot;10&quot; years in Clauses 1(2)and 1(4) i(2)   authorised the Home Secretary to!       introduce the Bill forthwith witha view to the Second Reading   and committee Stages of the Bill beingtaken in the ensuing week.

EXPORT CREDITSLEGISLATION.Assistance to yugoslavia.(previous reference:Cabinet 33(39)Conclusion 8. )13.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs reminded his colleagues that Prince Paul of Yugo-slavia was now on a visit to this country.     Hethought it important that action should he taken whichwould strengthen Prince Paul&apos;s influence in thepresent difficult international situation.      Up tothe present  1 million had been allocated to Yugo-slavia under Section 1 of the Export Guarantees Act,1939.      This could be used for defence requirementsother than lethal weapons.      In addition,   Yugoslaviahad been allotted  g- million of &quot;political&quot; creditsunder Section 4 of that Act.      He thought that PrincePaul would ask for further measures to assist Anglo-Yugoslav trade and also for an increase in politicalcredits, which could be used for armaments.As regards the former point he realised thatit would be difficult to take measures to increaseAnglo-Yugoslav trade.      He knew that the Presidentof the Board of Trade was at work on a number ofschemes including, for example, a scheme for encouraging-ing imports of timber.As regards political credits, he would like tohave authority to say to Prince Paul that we wereprepared to grant Yugoslavia a political credit of 1 million, making in all  1-g- millions, provided thatYugoslavia could put forward practical proposals fourthe utilisation of a credit of this, amount.Continuing, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that he also hoped itwould be possible to make a specific statement

to Yugoslavia as to the supply of aeroplanes fromthis country.     At a meeting of the Allied. Demands Sdb-fCommittee held the previous afternoon it had beenagreed that Yugoslavia could he supplied beforethe end of 1939 with 40 short-nosed Blenheimsand 12 Hurricanes.     He would be glad to be ableto make a statement to this effect to Prince Paul,and he would like to add that we hoped to be ableto make a further supply in, say, four or sixmonths1 time.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that hehad sent the Foreign Secretary a letter on thismatter.      In point of fact the Air Ministry couldo.-offer^little more than the figures the foreign secretary had mentioned.     The Air Ministry hadbeen dealing with very large foreign demands for aircraft in the past few months.     These demandscould only be met at some cost to our own security.He would discuss the matter further with the AirStaff and would suggest to the Foreign secretary the terms of a communication which might be madeto Prince Paul.The question was raised whether it waswise to supply armaments on a substantial scale to Yugoslavia with which we had no politicalagreements.The view expressed by the Foreign Secretary,and concurred in by the Cabinet, was that it was most desirable, on political grounds, to encourage

Ci L i.the Yugoslav Government.      It^wajs-^orisAcLered-thatif war ensued the people of Yugoslavia would fightthe Italians vigorously and energetically.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE, while not dissenting from the view that the amount ofpolitical credits given to Yugoslavia should beincreased to  1^ millions, asked the foreign secretary to include a word in his letter toPrince Paul as to the treatment of our own traders. ,It was clear that some interests in Yugoslavia were deliberately diverting trade to Germany.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) To authorise the increase of thetotal of political credits to bemade available to Yugoslavia from 5 million to  1^- millions, subjectto the conditions in (2) and (3) below.(2) To authorise the Foreign Secretaryto inform Prince Paul of Yugoslaviathat we were in a position to supplyarmaments to Yugoslavia up to atotal of approximately  1 million in 1939, and that political credits would be made available up to this amount.(3) That the Foreign Secretary shouldalso be authorised to informPrince Paul that we were prepared toexamine demands for the supply ofarmaments costing a further  500,000,and to grant a further politicalcredit to the extent that this provespossible.     The Foreign secretary would, no doubt, point out that while wewere anxious to meet such furtherdemands, it would be necessary toconsider how far we could do so without detriment to the needs of our ownServices and of our allies.(4) To invite the Secretary of Statefor Air to furnish the foreign secretary with the precise terms of a communication to Prince Paul as tothe aircraft supplies which could bemade available to Yugoslavia in thecourse of 1939.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.19th-4u*y, 1939.
