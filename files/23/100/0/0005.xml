le THE SECRETARY OP STATE P OR FOREIGN affairs said that his colleagues would hare seen $he recent telegrams, including Telegrams Nos0 155, 156 and 157from, and Telegrams Nos. 160, 161, 162 and 164 to,Sir William Seeds.     The latest stage of thenegotiations, which were becoming extremely involved,had been fully discussed by the Foreign PolicyCommittee on the previous day.     He thought that theCabinet would only wish to hear from him the main points at issue^The first point concerned the exclusion of holland and Switzerland from the list of guaranteedcountries.     The Foreign Policy Committee had reachedthe conclusion that there was little advantage to be gained from a suggestion which had been made thatHolland and Switzerland should be included in the listof guaranteed countries, but with a proviso thatmeant that the Russian guarantee did not extend tothese States until a pact of mutual assistance hadbeen concluded by Poland and Turkey with the soviet union.     It had been decided that the best plan was toagree to the exclusion of Holland and Switzerlandfrom the list of guaranteed countries, and to cover the case of these two countries by a provision for consultation.The second point at issue concerned the defini-tion of &quot;indirect aggression&quot;, and the questionwhether this definition should appear in:the pub-lished Treaty or in the secret protocol.     On theprevious Saturday M. Molotov had submitted a definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot; as a personalsuggestion.     On Monday he had withdrawn thissuggestion, and had substituted another formula

which appeared to the Foreign Policy Committee togive the Soviet Government a wide right of intervention in the internal affairs of othercountries, and on this ground to he open to graveobjection.,    The Foreign Policy Committee had reachedthe conclusion that if the latest formula submittedby the Soviet Government were to be amended soas to make it acceptable to us, the result woulddiffer very little from our o\m formula.   TheForeign Policy Committee had therefore decided thatwe should adhere to own formula.The third point at issue concerned anarticle suggested by the Soviet Government whereby,while the articles of the Political agreement would be initialled,they would not come intoactual operation until a Military Agreement hadbeen concludedc    The Foreign Policy Committee had reached the conclusion that, in the last resort, weshould be prepared to agree, that the Military andPolitical Agreements should come into operationsimultaneously, if we could obtain the acceptance by the Soviet Government of our views in regard to&quot;indirect aggression&quot;*The Foreign Secretary said that the FrenchGovernment had at first been disposed to takeexactly the opposite view to ourselves on theselast two issues.    They had not been disposed tooffer any strong resistance to the Russian proposals in regard to &quot;indirect aggression&quot;, but they had been strongly opposed to the proposals in regard toSimultaneous execution of the Military and Political

Agreements.    On second thoughts, however, theFrench Government had come round to our view thatthe Russian proposals in regard to &quot;indirect aggression&quot; were unacceptable.    They were still  .determined to resist the proposal that the Politicaland Military Agreements should only become operativesimultaneously and they had reached the -conclusionthat the time had come to take a firm line withthe Soviet representatives in the negotiations.The Foreign Secretary also drew attention toan important point in regard to the definition of&quot;indirect aggression&quot;a    The original proposal hadbeen that the phrase &quot;indirect aggression&quot; should appear in the published articles of the Treaty, butthat the definition of this phrase should appear ina secret   protocol    or supplementary letter.   Onreflection it had become clear that we were boundto be   asked     the   meaning of &quot;indirect aggression&quot;,and (that in the last resort it would prove impossible to keep the definition secret.    It wastherefore proposed that the definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot; set out in our latest formula, which inour view represented a perfectly defensibleattitude,  should appear not in the secret protocolbut in the published Treaty itself.The Foreign Secretary concluded by sayingthat   a telegram had been drafted to H.h. ambassador in Russia setting out these considerations.   this telegram also referred to the several points ofcardinal importance on which we had already madeconcessions, and stated that if the Soviet

Government were not prepared to accept the viewsset out in the telegram, it might he necessary forus to reconsider the whole position.In reply to a question, the Foreign secretary said that he was uncertain what interpretationshould he placed upon the attitude of the SovietGovernment.    Sir William Seeds was not too hopefulof the prospect of obtaining agreement on the basisof a simple tripartite pact.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, on the whole,he was disposed to take the view that the SovietGovernment intended to make an Agreement with us,but that they were probably in no hurry to do so.The Cabinet took note of the above statement, and authorised thedespatch to II. M. Ambassador at moscow of a telegram on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary.

jHB INTERNATIONAL   2. SHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSSITUATION (Contcg--- said that the previous evening he had had a long talkDanzig and Poland, with the Polish Ambassador who had just returned fromWarsaw.   A record would be circulated to his(previous reference: colleagues.Cabinet 35 (39)Conclusion 5) In brief, the Polish Ambassador said that/T/^. 3^ (3^)3.        he had found Warsaw calm.   Colonel Beck was determined not to provoke an issue with Germany overDanzig.   He thought    that rece::t gestures in Danzigdid not amount to very much, and were probably designedto provoke the Poles and to try their nerves.Colonel Beck had reached the conclusion that theright course was that Poland should not react seriouslyto these events.The Polish Ambassador had added that colonel beck was seeing whether he could discover oneperfectly clear breach of the Constitution byDanzig.     The Polish Ambassador had not been quite certain whether Colonel Beck would succeed in finding exactly what he wanted.    The foreign secretary was not sure that he had fully understoodwhat   Colonel Beck had in mind, but the PolishGovernment undertook to consult us before they took any action in this respect.     He understoodthat Colonel Beck had in mind that if any movewas made, it should be made in Danzig rather than inBerlin.     He did not rule out the possibility that conversations with Germany in regard to the Danzig7;-.-estion might prove to be possible, though not inthe immediate future.

The Foreign Secretary said that he had asked Count Raczynski whether the Polish Governmenthad been very much perturbed by our decision in regard to financial assistance.   He had repliedthat the reaction in Farsaw had not been so bad as hehad anticipated.     He gathered that Polish feelingshad been considerably relieved by the proposal to sendGeneral Ironside on a mission to Poland.     TheForeign Secretary said that there had been some discussion between the Ministers concerned as toGeneral Ironside&apos;s instructions.   He had reachedthe conclusion that it was impossible to draw aclearly defined line between the political andmilitary issues.    The main point of general ironside&apos;s mission would be that he should obtainbetter   information than we had hitherto beenable to obtain as to the directions in which MarshalSmigly-Rydz1 s mind was moving.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

flJIS INSSRHATIONALSITUATION (COKTD.)The position at Tientsin.(previous reference:Cabinet 35 (39)Conclusion 7).3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he could not yet say when thenegotiations at Tokyo would open.    Sir Robert Craigiehad suggested to the Japanese Minister for ForeignAffairs that the opening of the conversations- shouldhe postponed until the restriction on milk supplies to the British Concession at Tientsin had been removed.        He    felt that it must be for sir Robert Craigie to act as he thought best inthe light of his knowledge of the value which theJapanese would attach to the opening of negotiations.:1News had appeared in the Press that a british subject (Mr. House) had been stripped for thesecond time.    This news had not yet   been officially confirmed and the handling of thismatter had better be left to Sir Robert Craigie.There were also reports of continued discriminationsagainst British subjects at the barriers at tientsin, British subjects being subjected to considerable delays.Two days previously a telegraro. had been dispatched to Sir Robert Craigie (Telegram No. 561to Tokyo) setting out the situation generally asseen in London and asking him for his appreciation of the position.   A  telegram had also been dispatched to Washington asking whether theAmerican Government would be prepared to act with us, if and when currency questions were raised.
\
In reply to a question by the President Ofthe Board of trade the Foreign Secretary said thathe did not know what had become of the tiroposedwider statement on which Mr. Cordell Hull had been working some time ago.    He would enquire into thematter.In reply to the Secretary of State for India,the Foreign Secretary said that Colonel Spear wasto be tried not by court-martial but by a specialcourt which tried military personnel.    From a recent telegram it appeared that Sir Robert Craigiewas endeavouring to get in touch with Colonel Spearin order to make arrangements for his defence.The Cabinet took note of theForeign Secretary&apos;s statement.

INTERNATIONALITUATION   (Gojrtd)Italy *(previous reference:Cabinet 35 (39)Conclusion 5)4. TEE SECRETARY OP STATE FOA FOREIGN affairs referred to the suggestion which had been made atthe Meeting of the Cabinet referred to in the margin that a message in suitable terms should be conveyed from the Prime Minister to SignerMussolini through our Ambassador in Rome*.      sir percy   Loraine had seen Signor Mussolini and had formed the impression that he had been glad tosee   him and that his demeanour had. been less dourthan on previous occasions.     The Duce had expressed the opinion that there was no reason whythe Danzig question should give rise to a warprovided that it was recognised that Danzig was aGerman City and must be returned to Germany.     Hehad thrown out the suggestion that some kind of locarno arrangement should be concluded on theDanzig question.     Outwardly he had given full support to the German position.     The foreign secretary was satisfied however that the interviewhad been useful, from, the point of view of making ourposition clear and of encouraging Signor Mussolinito work behind the scenes.      It was of the utmost importance that the fact that this interviewhad taken place should not become known.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed with the need forsecrecy.     He attached the greatest importanceto making our point of view clear to signor mussolini since the latter was in a position inwhich he could certainly ensure that his viewsreached Herr Hitler&apos;s ears.     He thought that itwas significant that Signor Mussolini had said thathe must of course tell Herr Hitler the upshotOf his conversation with Sir Percy Lpraine.

Reference was made to the recentStatements which had been published in thePress in regard to the removal from the SouthTs^rol of foreign residents and of inhabitants of derman origin,,TUB PRIME MINISTER said that theinformation published in the Press, to theeffect that British subjects had been askedto move at 48 hours&apos;notice, and had been given no opportunity to move their property, suggestedvery high-handed action.     He thought that therewould be questions on this matter in parliament and he invited the Foreign Secretary to obtain further information as to the action actuallytaken and contemplated.     This was agreed to..In reply to a further question theFOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had no confirma--tion of reports appearing in the morning4 spapers to the effect that a German division had passed over the Brenner,

i. 51)UNITED STATESOP AMERICA.Amendment ofNeutralityLegislation.(previous reference cabinet 35 (39),Conclusion 8).5.        In reply to a question, THE foreign secretary said that, so far as he was able to judge, the position in regard to the amendmentof the Neutrality Legislation looked extremelyunfavourable.   This was, of course, unfortunateespecially in view of the fact that the UnitedStates Government had given as their reasonfor being unable to help us in several matters that to do so would prejudice the passage ofthe amending legislation.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

international situation.Egypt.(previous reference:Cabinet 30 (39)Conclusion 6)F.P..3Cj[3q)j.6, THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADEdrew attention to the recent telegram fromSir Miles Lampson (telegram No.  183 from Cairo),reporting an interview which he had had with king Farouk.      Not only had the King&apos;s attitudebeen somewhat disturbed,   but he had reported the presence o  200,000 Italian troops in Libya.It was pointed out that this figure of200,000 troops was very greatly in excess of theWar Office estimate of the number of Italian troopsin Libya,      It was thought that the figure of200,000 might be part of deliberate German or Italianpropaganda put about to disturb King Farouk&apos;mind,      The view was also expressed that our intelligence organisation in Egypt was greatly in need of improvement and that the Joint IntelligenceCommittee, the establishment of which had recentlybeen authorised, should be set up as a matter of urgency.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that Sir miles lampson was shortly coming home on leave and thathe would then discuss the whole question with him,including our intelligence organisation in Egypt. he also undertook to have an examination made into .theinformation at our disposal as to the number of italian troops in Libya.      If need be, a paper onthis matter would be circulated to the Cabinet.    Inthis connection he mentioned that it had beendecided, in the last few days, that a brigade ofBritish troops should be moved from Palestine to egypt.The Cabinet took, note of this statement.- 12 -

INTERNATIONAL ONAL   7. THE PRIME MINISTER said that-tlis-pro-ooaal whioifcSITUATION(Contd.) He had mentioned at the meeting of the Cabinet referredDefence to in the margin, to extend the naval exercises by-Preparedness;Naval making further ships available had been the subjectMeasures.of further consideration by the First Lord of the(previous reference:        Admiralty.     He (the Prime Minister) proposed to makeCabinet 35(39)Conclusion 6,    a statement on the matter in the House of Commons on the ensuing day.       The form of the reply had notbeen finally settled.     He thought that the rightplan was not to make too much of these measures atthe outset, but that they should gain increasing importance and interest as further information inregard to them became available.      The number ofships, apart from ships of the Home Fleet, which wouldtake part in the proposed concentration would beabout 130, and would include 3 capital ships, 16cruisers and over 50 destroyers.     This number ofships would be made up of (l) Reserve Fleet ships,(2) All ships    in Home Waters, other than Home Fleetships,  (3) H.M.S. Ramillies from the mediterranean fleet,     The concentration would take place inWeymouth Bay.     A suggestion had been made that HisMajesty The King should review the Fleet.The reasures proposed Involved the calling-upof 12,000 reservists.     The exercises would be spreadover August and September.     Following immediately upon the flights by squadrons of the Royal Air Forceover France, he thought that the announcement v/ould

have a considerable effect..     The reservists in question would be called up individually and they would be trained in the ships in which they would serve in theevent of war.In discussion, THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT asbsdwhether it was intended to compensate the NavalCharities for the loss which they would suffer as aresult of the cancellation of Navy Week?THE FIRST LORD said that the Naval Charitieshad considerable reserves.     Apart from the loss tothe Charities concerned, the cancellation of NavyWeek had many advantages.In reply to a question by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence, THE FIRST LORD OF THEADMIRALTY said that it would certainly be impressed upon-reservists that, although they were not being called out owing to an emergency, they were being called out for important national service.    the realisation of this position would be greatly facilitated if the fleet were to be reviewed by TheKing,The Cabinet authorised the PrimeMinister to make a statement in theHouse of Commons on the lines proposed.
r
FOREIGNAFFAIRS.Speeches by ministers.(previous reference ;Cabinet 15 (39)Conclusion 4)8.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that the foreign secretary&apos;s view, which he shared, was that thepresent international situation was best left tocool down, and that a reasonable solution of theDanzig problem should not be imxoossible if the temperature dropped.     He thought, therefore, thatit was desirable that Ministers should, so far aspossible, refrain from making speeches on international affairs in general, and on the Danzigquestion in particular for the present.     he appreciated that, for example, in speeches at bye-elections, it was inevitable that some reference should be made to foreign affairs, but even here he hoped the more controversial topics might be avoided.The Cabinet took note of this statement.It was agreed that Ministers should bring this matter to the notice of their parliamentary Secretaries.

POLAND. -propos als fora Cash Loan to(previous reference:Cabinet 34(39), Con-conclusion ion 9 *)9.    THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said, thatthe Polish Government had asked us not only forexport credits to enable them to buy armaments inthis country,, but also for a cash loan, which they required in order to purchase foreign war materials and to meet their budgetary difficulties causeff bytheir continued state of mobilisation.   -The grant of a ea.sh loan to Poland would be equivalent to a loss by this  country of gold.Nevertheless he had reached the conclusion thatwe should agree to make a. cash loan to Polandprovided that the French were prepared, to act with us in the matter.    mhe French had stated, that ifwe were prepared to lend  5 millions to the Poles0they would be prepared to lend 500 million Franc?(the equivalent of  5 millions) less an amount of270 million Francs which they ha^ already lent thisyear to Poland under the Rambouillet agreement.This offer ha^ been put to the Poles,  coupled witha suggestion or stipulation on the followingmatter.   An important reason why Poland was short of foreign exchange, and an important factor in poland&apos;s internal financial difficulties, was the over-valuation o^ the zloty.   We agreed, with theFrench in thinking that any credits granted to poland, should he used as a. basis for revision oftheir monetary policy.    If this was not done, anycredits granted would soon ^e used, up, and Poland&apos;financial situation would be as bad&apos;as ever.The Polish Government had not authorisedColonel Toe, who was in London, to discuss thismatter with us, and it appeared that they were likely to send another Delegation to London todiscuss  the question next week t

It was, of course, impossible to give any loan to Poland without Parliamentary sanction, and theParliamentary time-table made it essential that anagreement should be reached with the French and polish Governments in the course of that week.It was impossible to reach decisions with these governments in regard to Poland&apos;s monetary policyin the short time available.    It was therefore proposed to make an agreement for the creditsreferred to, but to provide that the money wouldnot be used without the agreement of the Frenchand British Governments.mhe Chancellor a.sked the Cabinet to authorise him to bring a Bill before the Committee of HomeAffairs, with a view to its introduction in theHouse of Commons without further reference to theCabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs referred to the visit of Mr Nash, the New ZealandFinance Minister.   He had hopes that he would reach an agreement with Mr Nash in the course ofthat afternoon, in which case Mr Nash would sailin the QUEEN MARY that evening.   He thought,however, that Mr Nash, who had been given to-understand that while we were granting export credits we were not gra.nting cash loans at this juncture, would be somewhat disturbed when heheard of the decision to grant a loan to Poland.-THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out-that the Dominion? enjoyed an important advantage in being able to come and make arrangements forthe issue o^ their loans&quot; on the London market.,. ........Further, their loans in general had the status of trustee Securities,    He also pointed out that thePolish loan was being-made jointly with the FrenchGovernment.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the decision togrant a loan to Poland rested on strategic ratherthan financial considerations, and that the end&apos;in view was ultimately in Few Zealand&apos;s own interest.THE SECR^ARY OP  STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, on the basis of information which hadrea.ched him, he thought it would be undesirable that the Polish Government should be pressed toohard to give effect to measures of devaluationin the immediate futuresThe Cabinet authorised the Chancellor of theExchequer -(l)  to conclude an agreement on thelines indicated for a, cash loan of  5 millions to Poland., on theunderstanding that the PolishGovernment take suitable stepsto improve their financial andeconomic position:fs)  to arrange for the submission tothe Conw.ittee op Home Affairs ofa Ej.ll authorising the above loan,and, subject to the approval ofthat Committee,  for the introductionof the Pill in the House of Commonswithout further reference to theCabinet.

CZECH 100   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byBALANCES.the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. -152 (39)), in(previous reference: -   which he described the position in respect of theCabinet 11(39), Con-     Czech balances held by the Bank of England as a resultelusion 2.)of the embargo placed on credits held in this country on Czecho-Slovak account, after the invasion of Czecho-Slovakia in March, 1939, by means of the Czecho-Slovakia(Restriction on Banking Accounts, etc.) Act.     Theseblocked assets were likely to amount to about  15-g-millions, out of which it was desired to obtain satis-faction of the Treasury claim in respect of the  millions lent to Czecho-Slovakia, and also to secure thetransfer to a Czech Refugee Fund administered by Britishtrustees,  of about  3f- millions, out of the free gift of  4 millions made to the Czecho-Slovak Government, tohelp refugees from Czechoslovakia arilpreviously administered by the Refugee institute in Prague.      There were alsoprivate cash claims amounting (as presented) to  3.8millions,  and private claims in respect of bonds,industrial participations, real estate, etc.The Memorandum then proceeded to discuss thedifficulties, both practical and Parliamentary, inherent in any attempt to settle these matters, either by negotiation with the German Government or by unilateral action, or by means of a combination of the two methods.Since it was impossible to reach an agreement with theGerman Government, which could be submitted for theapproval of Parliament before the Summer Recess, the -Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the best

solution was that an announcement might he made inthe House of Commons on the following lines:-&quot;That the assets blocked under the Czecho-Slovakia (Restrictions on Banking Accounts,etc.) Act, cannot remain blocked indefinitely;and we propose to work out a Scheme fordealing with those assets and in particular for a distribution in settlement of Britishclaims (including the repayment of theTreasury advance and the unblocking of thebalance of the money which Parliament madeavailable for Refugees).      In that connection it would- be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, under the authority of appropriatelegislation, to act unilaterally, but thereare certain practical reasons which make itdesirable that unilateral action should, ifpossible, be avoided, and that this scheme,more particularly as regards the handling ofthe Refugee problem and the assessment of claims, should be worked out in conjunctionwith the de facto authorities in Prague.    Itis therefore&apos; proposed to open discussions withthe German authorities, but the House ofCommons may rest assured that any scheme forthe distribution of the assets, whether broughtinto operation unilaterally or agreed upon,with the German authorities, will be made subject to the specific approval of parliament before being brought into operation.&quot;The Chancellor also proposed, in order to meetthe lack of funds for Refugees, likely to arise from a postponement of distribution of the blocked assetsuntil the autumn, the immediate presentation of a supplementary Estimate   which would probably requireto be promoted by the Home Office   designed to providethe necessary funds on a tempoarry basis until such time as the sums blocked in the Refugee account at theBank of England could be released, either under Legisla-tion or in accordance with the terms of any scheme agreedto by the Germans and approved by Parliament.      TheChancellor asked for the authority of his colleagues toproceed on the lines summarised above.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER drew attentionto the main points in his Memorandum.In paragraph 10 he had set out the mainobjections to acting unilaterally.      In paragraph 12onwards he had set out the objections to negotiating with the German Government.      To these might be addeda jBoint which had been made in the House of Commons theprevious day, namely, that if we negotiated with theGerman Government, this would involve disclosure tothat Government of-the fact that a number of ex-Czecho-slovalc subjects had been holding money in London.Many of them might well have concealed that fact,  andwould suffer for it if it became known.The Chancellor said that he had reached thegeneral conclusion that it was impossible at this stage to indicate   either that we would act unilaterally or thatwe would open negotiations with Germany.      The onlyeourse was therefore to make a rather temporisingstatement, and to offer the assurance that any schemefor distribution of the assets, whether brought intooperation unilaterally or by agreement with the GermanGovernment, would be submitted to Parliament before being brought into operation.The Chancellor added that he would have to makea statement in the House of Commons on this matter onThursday in reply to a Question.     He read out the termsof the proposed answer.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that this matter was an extremely difficult one.     Whatever coarse we took we should be exposed to criticism.     A furthercomplication was that the German Government had justinformed us that they would refuse an exequatur to ourConsul-General at Prague unless we recognised theGerman Protectorate over Bohemia and Moravia.     He thought- 21 -

that the following considerations were of importance.First, that there was a tussle in Germany between theextreme and more moderate advisers, and a flat refusal wouldbe a rebuff to the latter.     Secondly, that we did not want to take action which would increase the difficulties ofthose who were organising relief or settlement schemes forCzech refugees.     He could not suggest any improvements onthe Chancellor of the exchequers proposal.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER wished to make itclear that he did not believe that it ?/ould in fact bepossible to reach agreement with the German Government.Their main object was to secure foreign exchange.     Havingregard to what had happened in regard to the action takenby the Bank of International Settlements, it was impossibleto suppose that we could make a settlement which gave theGerman Government more foreign exchange.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY (Designate) thought thatthe fact that we were unlikely to reach an agreement withthe German Government would justify a somewhat firmerconclusion to the draft reply which the Chancellor had read out.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE suggested thatthe Chancellor might indicate in his reply that, subjectto the checking of the validity of the claims submitted,it was clear that the amount of those claims was in excessof the amount of Czech Balances in this country.     an assurance on these lines would, he thought, considerablyease the Parliamentary position.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER undertook to consult v/ith the Minister of Supply and the President ofthe Board of Trade in regard to the points raised by themin regard to the draft reply to be given on Thursday.While he agreed that claims based, for example, on theexistence of a deposit in a bank at Prague should be- 22 -

admitted as a claim &quot;against the Czech Balances in thiscountry., he did not feel that claims-based on compensation in respect of real estate in Bohemia shouldbe admitted.     He thought that if the claims were les6than the amount of the Czech Balances? a considerablevolume of opinion would be in favour of the Balanceremaining in a Suspense Account.After further discussion, the cabinet authorised the Chancellor of theExchequer to make a statement inthe House of Commons on the general lines proposed as summarised onpage 20 of these Minutes, bearing inmind the points raised in discussion in the Cabinet.

the interim Report--of CabinetCo3Mittee.(previous reference:Cabinet 1(39), Con-cTusion 5).lle  T/he Cabinet bad under consideration an InterimReport (CP, 151(39)) by the Cabinet Committee appointedat the Meeting referred to in the margin   &quot;to keep underreview questions arising out of the Refugee Problem andto report when necessary to the Cabinet.&quot;     The immediate question for consideration by the Cabinet was whether,in the light of the situation outlined therein. his majesty&apos;s Government should maintain the existing policyof not participating financially in the expenses ofrefugee settlement and emigration, or should indicate their willingness to depart from that policy, and participate on a basis proportionate to the amount ofprivate subscription,? if other Governments agreed andwere prepared to do likewise.      If the Cabinet decided toadopt the latter alternative, the Committee suggested -(a) That the Paymaster-General should make astatement at the forthcoming meetings ofthe London Intergovernmental Committeefor Refugees on the following lines&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Goveiroment are, for their part, examining the manner and extent towhich private subscription to an inter-national fund to assist in defraying theexpenses of overseas emigration of refugees might be encouraged by government participation, possibly on a basis propor-tionate to the amount of privatesubscription, and I would earnestly invitemy colleagues to lay these considerationsbefore their Governments and to communicatetheir viev/s to me without delay.     if other Governments arc prepared to agreeto this change of principle, and to co-operate in such participation. His Majecty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom willtake the initiative in proposing a schemefor the purpose, which I will circulatein the Autumn&quot;.(b) That Parliament should be informed of thesubstance of this statement at the same time by means of Question and Answer.(c) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldalso inform Mr. Lionel Rothschild whose schemefor the finance of refugee settlement wasunder consideration by the Cabinet Committee.If, however, it was decided to adopt the former

alternative, Mr. Lionel Rothschild&apos;s plan (whichcontemplated the raising of an international fund inthe principal countries represented on the EvianCommittee, the first issue, to he equivalent to  20millions, of which  5 millions would he raised inLondon could only he commended as an object forcharitable support.THE HOME SECRETARY in outlining the main points in the Report drew attention to the followingcons iderations: -First, that the funds of the voluntary organisations, many of which had provided substantialfunds, would,for the most part, be exhausted by theend of the year.    Secondly, that there were about40,000 refugees in this country as transmigrants.Thirdly, that, after lengthy discussion, the point hadbeen reached at which the German authorities had offered to set up a trust fund,the proceeds of which would beavailable to finance the emigration of refugees.Sir Herbert Emerson was satisfied that some   millions would be made available in this way.    Unless, however, ascheme was actually started, this offer would lapse.Fourthly, there were indications that the leading JeW*sin this country and in the United States would, co-operate in a scheme provided that such a scheme could be started.After very full discussion, he had reached the conclusionthat the Paymaster-General should be authorised to malcea cautious statement on the lines indicated in his memorandum and quoted on page 24 of these minutes.    Theessential point, was to secure the co-operation of theUnited States of America,    Consideration of the detailsof the scheme could be j)ostponed until the Autumn, but

&quot;unless the Paymaster-General- had discretion to ma.ce this statement now,, there was a danger that the other parties concerned would throw in their.hands.. TIED HOME SECRETARY added that he had had some discussion with Sir William V/iseman and a number of leading United Spates Citizens,    He thought that theywere prepared to make a genuine effort to get a bigscheme started.    Indeed, it might not be necessary thatthis country should make a grant towards the scheme,nevertheless, he asked that the Paymaster-General shouldhave discretion to make a statement on the lines proposed.(At this -point the First Lord of theAdmiralty left the meeting.)THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thereason for the present position was that a large numberof refugees had.been allowed to enter this country onthe assumption that they were transmigrants.    Hitherto,however, no ultimate destination had been found for themand they had therefore remained here.    If these persons were to continue in this country indefinitely, there wasa strong possibility that they would become dependenton public funds.    He therefore thought that it was inour own interests to offer to join in contributing tothe Rothschild fund if by doing so we could help tosecure that these people left this country.for their ultimate destinations,   V/e.must, however, make our offer to participate in the scheme subject to thefollowing conditions

Firsts that our contributions were in respectof emigration overseas.    Secondly,,, that this was not acase in whicn His Majesty&apos;s Government should give a lead../e should not go beyond saying that if others contributedwe Sixould be prepared to do likewise.    r.e did not altogether share the importance given in tne Report ofthe Committee to tiie German Government1 s offer.    He doubted whether we should get much value from this offer whichwas considerably hedged round by conditions.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR thought that the balanceof argument in the Report was against the making of astatement on the lines proposed.    He thought that itwould be very difficult to justify giving betterfacilities to foreign refugees than to our own people tosettle in the Empire.    Again, it was difficult to prefer the claims of foreign refugees to the claims of Britishsubjects in Newfoundland and in the overcrowded islands of the ,/est Indies.    Finally9 he was of opinion thatin a few months1 time we should be able to absorb these refugees in our own home markets.ThE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ThE COLONIES agreed with the home Secretary&apos;s view that if the settlementof refugees overseas was left to private enterprise9money would not be available to enable action to be taken on an adequate scale.    He was confirmed in this by experience of what had happened on a number of other occasions.    For example, it had been represented to us that if we were to make a statement as to the availability of land in British Guiana for settlement of refugees,money would be forthcoming from private sources.    But

in the event this had not happened.    He favoured theadoption of the course proposed by the Home Secretarysubject to two conditions; first, that other governments would Help; secondly^that Government contributions wouldbe proportionate to contributions from private sources.The aspect of the matter which caused him mostanxiety was the finding of places where the refugeescould settle.   He gave a survey of the position in theColonial Empire.In British Guianag it had been agreed that a smallexperimental settlement should be carried out and,provided this preliminary experiment was satisfactory, ithad been suggested that it would be possible to proceed ona much larger scale.    But^British Guiana could not at the-tftee-t o on tribute moro land than would our jrirtse for somescores of thousands of settlers.In Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland   a survey whichhad been carried out showed that there was room for500-700 settles    The cost per head was however very highand the Joint Consultative Committee for Refugees had asked that the Report of the Mission of Enquiry should not bepublished.Tanganyika had offered to receive refugees9 but nonewere willing to go to this territory.    There was also theconsideration that if Jewish refugees were sent toTanganyika5 Germany would probably obstruct the wholerefugee scheme.Kenya had taken some two or three hundred refugees and there was room in the colony for a comparatively smallsettlement scheme.Broadly s therefore s the Colonial Empire could onlycontribute very littles unless development proved possiblein British Guiana on a large scale.

17 3Palestine would, receive 75,000 Jewish emigrants in thenext five years, most of whom would he refugees.      Inregard to Australia, it had at one time been suggestedthat Australia should take 30,000 refugees over threeyears but the Australian Government had reduced this figure to 15,000.      In vie?; of the limited possibilitiesof the Empire^he thought that it was necessary that theUnited States of America and countries in South Americashould be pressed to share the burden with us.Minister of Labour, he thought that it was fair topoint out that we were proposing to collect large amounts of private capital which would be used to develop our colonial Empire.     Nevertheless there would be strong criticism that we were not doing enough for our ownBritish subjects who were living in Turkey and Greece;were not permitted to hold land or to engage in varioustrades, and who were virtually &quot;on the Dole&quot;.     The british council had been anxious that they should be moved   to kenya/.     The position of these Maltese British subjectswas now being investigated by an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee.     In regard to the West Indies, in many of the islands the surplus population could only be providedfor by being settled on the land.      Something had beendone in regard to Jamaica, but he felt    sure   that theforthcoming Report of the Royal Commission on the west indies would press for further action in this respect.The Secretary of State for the Colonies did not suggest that these considerations afforded ground for rejecting the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal.      He thought,In regard to the points mentioned by thepeople.He instanced the plight of maltese

however, that it should he recognised that if actiaawas taken on the lines recommended in the Reportthere would he an irresistible demand for takingsimilar action in regard to certain British subjects.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR DOMINION affairs wasindisposed to press Australia to increase the numberof refugees which she was willing to admit, unlesssoundings showed that there was some likelihood that she would be prepared to do so.      He thoiight that theadoption of these proposals would strengthen the handsof the critics who had pressed for a more energeticpolicy in regard to emigration but nevertheless he supported the Committee&apos;s Report.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  saidthat he supported the proposals in the Committee&apos;s Report.Belgium and Holland   two of the countries represented onthe Evian Committee - had accepted very large numbers of refugees on a temporary basis and were now alarmed atthe failure to find places in which these refugeescould settle.     He saw no way in which the dead-lockcould be broken down, except on the lines proposed.He also thought that the psycological effect on Jewishopinion of seeing even a small number of refugees goingtoverseas as settlers, would be very valuable.     Asregards the Colonial Secretary&apos;s survey of the possibili-ties of finding areas for settlement,    he thought thatthe adoption of the Home SecretaryTs proposals represented the, only way of getting countries to adopt a moresympathetic attitude to the problem.-SO-

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he assumed that any money which this country made availablefor settlement would be used for the settlement of refugees now in this country, rather than of those in belgium and Holland.THE HOME SECRETARY agreed $hat this should bemade a condition.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was a verydifficult question, but he had reached the conclusionthat the Home Secretary&apos;s recommendations should beadopted, provided it was clearly understood that itwas essential that the co-operation of the UnitedStates of America should be secured.     This co-operation would, he thought, go far to help us to meet criticism.THE HOME SECRETARY suggested that it would bedesirable that the Paymaster-General should discuss thematter with Mr. Myron Taylor, before the meeting of theInter-Governmental Committee, in order to ascertain whether it would be helpful if a statement on the lines proposed was made.      This was agreed to, and it was feltthat an approach, at this stage, should be made to Mr.Myron Taylor direct rather than officially through theForeign Office to Washington.The Cabinet -(i) authorised the Paymaster-General tomake a statement to the Inter-Departmental Committee at theirforthcoming meeting on the lines indicated in paragraph 19 of the Reportof the Committee on the Refugee Problemquoted on page 24 of these Conclusions.(ii) authorised the Paymaster-General totake preliminary soundings ofMr. Myron Taylor, before making theabove statement.

FOOD (defence plans)LEGISLATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 49(38), Con-clusion 8.)12. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (CP.-150(39)) in which he sought the approval of his colleagues for the preparation of a Bill (for introduction beforethe House rose, so that it might be consideredimmediately the House reassembled after the summer recess) with the following objects:-(l) To transfer the responsibility for theFood (Defence Plans) Department from thePresident of the Board of Trade to another minister:(2) To provide that Minister with certainstatutory powers over and above those at present available to him under theEssential Commodities Reserves Act.With reference to (l) above, the Chancellor ofthe Duchy recalled that the Prime Minister had announced in the House of Commons on the 6th Aprilthat he proposed to make arrangements whereby theresponsibility for the Food (Defence Plans)Department should be transferred from the Presidentof the Board of Trade to another Minister, and thathe (the Chancellor of the Duchy) had agreed to takeover this responsibility.      The Memorandum continuedthat it was desirable that the transference of ministerial responsibility should be regularised atthe earliest opportunity.      The existing arrangements could not be considered satisfactory, and until theposition of the Minister responsible for Food defence was regularised he could not be nominated as thecompetent authority in the draft Defence regulations or in the Orders made thereunder for the purposes offood control in time of emergency.

In regard to (2) above, the Chancellor of the duchy explained in his Memorandum the purposes forwhich additional powers were urgently required.     he considered, however, that the Bill should be drawn in wide terms, with a view to meeting anticipatedfuture needs.     He therefore asked that the Billshould provide for the following additional powers:-(a) to enable the Department to provide facilities for the storage of foodstuffs.(The present Act does not enable theDepartment to provide storage facilitiesdirectly except for the reserve stocks which they require);(b) to enable the Department to give assistanceto traders towards the improvement of storage facilities.    (The present Actenables the Department to give assistanceto traders towards the improvement of thefacilities for the storage of stocks asaugmented under the powers in the Act.The application of the powers in the Actto the improvement of the storage facilities of traders for existing commercial stocksis not free from doubt):(c) to enable compensation to be paid totraders for extra charges incurred as aresult of dispersal of stocks:(d) to enable cold storage accommodation tobe maintained or provided, sufficient tomeet the situation likely to arise intime of war:(e) to increase the capacity of processingplant for foodstuffs in the country,either by the erection of Governmentplant or the extension of commercialplant, as necessary to meet requirements in time of war.

In regard to the additional statutory powersasked for, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERexplained that a great deal had been done by voluntary agreement with the trade organisations concerned.     There were, however, certain problems which could not be dealt with without further powers.Of these, perhaps the most important concerned the dispersal of stocks.     The Committee of ImperialDefence had decided that shipping should, so far aspossible, be diverted in time of war to West coast ports.     The extent to which this could be donedepended, not mere3yupon port facilities, but alsoupon the extent to which depots were availablewithin reach of the ports.Si-noe hie Memorandum had been-prepared-,-^further matter^had been brought&apos;to his notice, namely,the camouflage of certain food producing centres.   he hoped, however, that this matter would prove to be covered by the Civil Defence Bill. UAS, c.^s&apos;,cUAfT^In the course of discussion it was suggestedthat the payment of compensation to traders for extra charges incurred as the result of the dispersal of stocks would be a dangerous precedent.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that a number .of organisations had agreed readily to locate their headquarters outside the vulnerable areas, and had not suggested that the Government should compensate themfor the expense incurred.     In general, the paymentof compensation for necessary adjustments to meetwar conditions was to be deprecated,.

(2) That the above authority should be withoutprejudice to the question whether it was necessaryto authorise the expenditure of public money in   /   ,respect-Of the, additional powers now sought/,cw(3) To postpone a decision in regard to the date of introduction of the Bill until it has been approvedby the Committee of Home Affairs.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY (Designate) said, that he was making certain payments to traders in order to induce them to keeplarger stocks than normal in store.   But it was felt that pay-men t in respect of additional stocks fell to he determined on different grounds.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER pointed out thatin time of war the stocks of food in question would all &quot;becomeGovernment property.    The risk to be guarded against was notmerely destruction from air bombardment, but the risk that owing to transport conditions, the goods could not be moved in time of war.   He thought that when payment was made for     *-stocks taken over, it would be right to have regard to any amount which had been expended in ameliorating the stocks or their location.   The question of what compensation, if any,should be paid in each case, would, of course, be a matter fordetermination in consultation with the Treasury.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOaRD OP TRADE suggested that thepowers in the Ministry of Supply Bin could be used to dealwith one urgent matter, namely,    plant for the hydrogenationof edible oils.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER undertook toexamine this suggestion.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) To authorise the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster to arrange for the drafting of a Bill -(a) to transfer the responsibility for the Pood(Defence Plans) Department from the Presidentof the Board of Trade to another Minister:(b) to provide the Minister in charge of the Pood(Defence Plans) Department with additionalstatutory powers, as summarised on page   33    ofthese Minutes:
