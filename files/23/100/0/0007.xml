ARRANGEMENTSlo    THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Meeting of&amp; RECESS^ tlie Cabinet on Wednesday, the 2nd August would he thelast Meeting of the Cabinet to be held before the^Reference:        Recess unless some question arose which required ailXtili if Special MeetingFRu-o&amp;q) &apos;3- was very difficult to give any definiteguidance as to the date when normal weekly Meetingsof the Cabinet would be resumed after the Recess,On the assumption, however, that matters continued on a normal footing, he thought that it would benecessary that the House of Commons should meet earlyin October? either In the first or second week.     Thiswould necessitate normal weekly Meetings of thef. -Cabinet being resumed at some date in September,     Heiwould notify the Cabinet^of the precise date as soon-as this was practicable0The Prime Minister said tha$-. if any untoward eventtook place in the Recess, the Cabinet would, of course,by summoned,    -In. ixny event he thought that it&apos;mightbe desirable that at some time during the Recess heshould ask those of his colleagues who were within reach of London to attend a Conference of Ministers,He would   not, however, propose to hold a Meeting of thefull Cabinet in the Recess unless some event of first importance arose.In discussion, the suggestion   that a Conferenceof Ministers should be held during the Recess was welcomed,This course would also, it was thought have a good effecton public confidence.     The view was also expressed thatthe demand that Parliament should meet from time to time during August and September had very little support,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR undertook toconsider a suggestion that aircraft should be made

available to bring Cabinet Ministers to London fromthe North of England or Scotland if a Meeting shouldbe summoned at short notice.The Cabinet took note of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.

2 j. sTHE INTER-national situation.Danzig.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(39), Oon-conclusion ion 3 .)2. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs reported certain information of a secret character which had reached him in regard to the German attitude as to Danzig.    This information confirmed theSecretary of State in the view he had previouslyexpressed, that the right  course was to show a firmfront and to work for a detente.(Further details of the information given are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of Cabinet Conclusions.)THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR DOMINION affairs referred to a suggestion which had been made by someof the Dominion High Commissioners in London that an endeavour should be made, using Signor Mussolini asan intermediary, to arrange a definite postponement of any attempt to settle the Danzig issue.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had. thought over this matter and had discussedit with the Prime Minister.   He had reached theconclusion that to make such a move at the presenttime would convey the impression that we were in astate of nervous apprehension as to Danzig and wanted.Signor Mussolini to get us out of a difficulty.The fact that M. Daladier&apos;s response had not beenvery encouraging to the approach which Sir EricPhipps had made to him on the question of effectingan improvement in Ita.li.an relations with France, was another reason for not making a further approach to signor Mussolini at the present, time.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he entirely agreed,with the Foreign secretary  s view that an approach on the lines indicated would be most undesirable atthe present time.A

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs undertook to inform the High. Commissionersfor Australia and South Africa, who had raised thematter, of the conclusion which had been reached inregard to it.The Cabinet took note of the statement made by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.-4-

99 fPOLAND.0   proposals fora Cash loan to.(previous reference: -Cabinet 58(39), Con-elusion 4. )3.    THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thatthe Polish Government had brought to an end thenegotiations on this matter.    It had been made quite clear to the representatives of the Polish Governmentthat we and the French were prepared to give Poland-help, subject to certain conditions.    We were notprepared, however, to give Poland gold which poland would store in vaults at Warsaw and make the basis for further expansion of her paper currency.The Chancellor said that, in an answer which hehad given to a Question in the House of Commons onthe previous day, he had referred to the offer tothe Polish Government of export credits to the amountof  8 millions, and he had done his best to make the reply in regard to the cash loan appear as innocuousas possible.    A full statement of the facts would, ofcourse, be somewhat encouraging to Germany.Reference was made to misleading statements whichhad appeared in certain newspapers that morning(the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;News-Chronicle&quot;) tothe effect that this country had refused to make a cash loan to Poland and had prevented Poland frompurchasing in other countries supplies which couldnot be obtained in this country.    The foreign secretary was invited to take such steps as were possible to correct this misleading impression.The view generally expressed was that it would haveto be made clear that the Polish Government had insisted on certain stipulations which H.M.  Governmenthad been unable to entertain.THE SECTETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs explained that a telegram had already been despatched to Warsaw to correct a misleading passage which .

had appeared in the Polish official statementrefusing a cash loan on the conditions offered by us.The Cabinet took note of these statements.

ilitaryission to.previous references cabinet 37(39), Con-clusion 2.)4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had had a long talk with General Ironsidewhich had left him with the impression that thePolish Government would not resort to military actionunless there was a definite military invasion ofPoland by the German Army,     He thought that thePolish Government would deal with incidents inDanzig by means of protests.     Generally, the attitudeof the Poles was calm.     Marshal Smigly-Rydz, howeveivappeared to take the view that German ambitions wereincompatible with the existence of a Polish State,and that war was inevitable.     The Marshal did not,however, expect war in August, and said that if wardid not break out in August it would not occur until january, when the ground would be frozen.The Cabinet took note of this statement.7 -s

THE INTERNATIONAL 5.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSSITUATION.--- said that his colleagues would have seen the longiRussiatelegram from Sir William Seeds (No.  170 from Moscow)(previous reporting his interview with M. Molotov on the reference: tireiCabinet 38 (39) 84*fch- July.      At this interview little had been saidConclusion 1. )about indirect aggression, but the Soviet Governmenthad been informed that we were prepared to acceptArticle VI and to agree to simultaneous entry intoforce of the political and military Agreements.      this had given great satisfaction to M. Molotov who had asked whether the military conversations could startat once.      On this point, Sir William Seeds and theFrench Ambassador had said they must obtain theinstructions of their Governments.M* Molotov&apos;s attitude had been that if wewere prepared to agree that military conversations should start at once, he did not think that the definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot; in Article 1 orthe other outstanding points would give rise toinsuperable difficulties.The Foreign Secretary said that he was nowin consultation with the French Government on theproposal that we should embark on military conversations with the Soviet Government as soon as military representatives could be made available forthis purpose, and on the assumption that a determined attempt would be made to conclude thenegotiations on the political agreement as soon aspossible.The Foreign Secretary said that it seemed,likely that willingness to start military conversations was regarded by the Russians as a test of our good faith.      He thought that the opening of  -

these conversations would have a good effect on world opinion, although he did not disguise his viewthat the Conversations would take a very long time.THE PRIME MINISTER invited attention to theremark made hy the Turkish President to a Journalistto the effect that negotiations with Russia would continue to drag on until we made it clear that wewere prepared to face the risk of a breakdown(Telegrain No.  203 from Alexandria. )Discussion ensued on the difficulties ofcarrying on military conversations with the SovietGovernment, more especially until a political pacthad been concluded.      It was pointed out that we should put ourselves in a very weak position if we gaveconfidential information to the Soviet government before we had concluded any pact with them.      Therewas general agreement with the view that our representatives should be instructed to proceed veryslowly with the conversations until a political pact hadbeen concluded.      In particular, it would be desirablethat we should not allow Russia to start the conversations by obtaining information as to our ownplans, but should rather endeavour to secure that theRussians let our representatives know   what theycould do to help e.g. Poland.      It was desirable toestablish closer relations between Russia and poland and efforts in this direction, which would be very valuable, would be likely to occupy some time.THE minister POR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCEreferred to the importance of representatives ofTurkey as well as Poland being brought into the military conversations at some stage.      He mentioned thepossibility that Turkey might be able to move large

forces from the Caucasus to her Western Frontiers.He agreed that the right way of starting themilitary conversations would he to ask Russiawhat action she proposed to take if war &quot;broke out.The Cabinet took note of the statement made by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.

yonTHE INTER-       60 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POREIGN AFFAIRS saidRATIONAL*situation        that the negotiations in Tokyo on the local Tientsin(Contdo)issues had started on Monday afternoon,,      The JapaneseThe position at Tientsin:   had formulated demands under three heads (Telegram No,The Tokyonegotiations.   860 from Tokyo),     First, control of anti-Japanese(previous        activities in the Concession;    secondly, currencyReference:38(39), Con-   questions;    thirdly, the proposal that we should handelusion 2).over the silver in the Concessions in Pekin and Tientsin.F.R.A-0(^)^&apos;7-These demands, which probably represented all that theJapanese hoped to obtain, were in accordance with thegeneral expectation.-,     Every endeavour would of course be made to assist Sir Robert Craigie In securing areduction of the Japanese demands.     A fact-findingSub-Committee, representing both the British and japanese Delegations, had been appointed (a) to reach agreement as to what was the existing procedure in theTientsin Concession for handing over criminals for trial,etc.,  (b) to reduce to writing the modifications of that procedure which the Japanese desired to see introduced,(Telegram No. 861 from Tokyo).The Foreign Secretary said that he would notconceal from his colleagues that the negotiations wouldbe very difficult, particularly in regard to currencymatters.      There was no doubt that on the currencyissues the United States ought to help us.      In reply toa   request from the State Department at Washington wehad explained our point of view to them, but it was clear that the United States Government did not wish tobe directly associated with us in the negotiations andthat their attitude was not likely to be very helpful,

Continuing,1 the Foreign Secretary said that the reception in China of the formula on general terms which had been agreed upon in Tokyo had been unfavourable,as had been expected.      The Chinese Ambassador, who hadbeen to see him, had expressed himself as greatlyapprehensive.     He, (the Foreign Secretary), had replied that he was not surprised at the attitude ofthe Chinese Ambassador since it was part of the Japaneseplan to make it appear that we were betraying China.He had urged Mr. Quo not to play the Japanese game.The telegrams from Shanghai, and from Chungkingreporting Chiang Kai Chek&apos;s attitude, had also been in which the same vein.     A message had been sent with theobject of reassuring Marshal Chiang Kai Chek as far as this was possible.The Foreign Secretary said that he was satisfiedthat the right course was to hold our position in theFar East and to take whatever action was possible to extricate ourselves from a difficult position.     He had had some discussion on the previous day with theJapanese Ambassador, who had expressed the view thatMr. Arita was experiencing great difficulties, but wasfinding his way round them.     The Foreign Secretary had told the Japanese Ambassador, who had been very friendly,that, provided the Japanese Government did not pressimpossible demands upon us, he hoped that means couldbe found for reducing the tension.Reference was made by the MINISTER OF transport to Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s telegram of the 20th July(No. 821 from Tokyo) in which he had proposed theintroduction of legislation permitting restrictions on imports from Japan.

9 9 Q j i-J the FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it was, ofcourse, possible that the mere introduction of legis-lation might have a good effect.      If this did not prove to be the case, however, we should then be exposed to strong pressure to make use of it;    and itwas essential to consider where such action would leadus.     He pointed out further that at an earlier stage,Sir Robert Craigie had not been in favour of economicretaliation unless the United States Government wereprepared to co-operate with us, and unless we wereprepared to use force.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE added thatthe general lines of the legislation which would be needed if it were decided to adopt the policy of retaliation, had been settled and that as a precautionarymeasure, steps were being taken to have a Bill drafted.The Cabinet took note of the statement bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

international situation (Oonfd)Egypt&apos;(previous reference:Cabinet 37 (39)Conclusion 6.)7. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Egyptian Prime Minister had expressed great pleasure at the proposedreinforcements from India, and was greatlyreassured as to the position.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER andTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR hoped that this opportunity would not he lost of securing that egypt fulfilled her obligations in regard to theprovision of barrack accommodation for our troops.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Egyptian Prime Minister was in badhealth and was not likely to continue much longer in office.The Cabinet took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.

SITUATION (Confd)Spain.(previous reference:Cabinet 33 (39)Conclusion 6.)8. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSctmy%*$&amp; 7i**** &quot;fitk^      W sC&amp;tU w?&apos;/^referred to a recent 41o spa1 toJwffgwws Sir MauricePeterson, who had expressed the view that theposition as regards Spain was by no meansunfavourable from the point of view of theinternational situation.     The Italians and germans were by no means popular.     The Spanish people were friendly to us, though our relations withthem suffered in some measure from theirirritation at the attitude adopted, by France.The internal position of Spain was somewhatchaotic, and the view was held that it was most unlikely that Spain would become involved in waragain for a very long time.THE CABINET took note of. this statement.- 15 -

9 9 9&amp; el k)INTERNATIONAL*gITUATION( cont&apos; d. )Attitude ofthe Press.(previous reference:Cabinet  20 (39)Conclusion 1)9. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLANDpointed out that in recent weeks the London, press had indulged in a number of stunts in connectionwith the international situation.    There had beenposters to the effect that there would bepeace during August because Germany willed it.On the previous day there had been a sensationalstory that Hitler was ill.    The effect ofthese announcements must be to make Germanythink that we were in a state of nervousapprehension.    German air manoeuvres wereto take place in North-West Germany and ifthese were written up it might result in increasing the tension.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said he thought the newspaper proprietors were open to persuasion on individual questions.    He instanced a seriesof articles on the Secret Service written forthe Evening Standard which were filled withundesirable matter, and which he had hopeswould not appear as a result of representations which he had made.    He thought, however, thatit would be more difficult to deal with thegeneral tendency for newspapers to be inflamatory.While emphasizing the difficulty of takingeffective action, the Foreign secretary undertook to consider whether any action was possible in the matter.The Cabinet took note of these statements.
\
SITUATION (Contd.)Turkey.(previous references cabinet 38(39)Conclusion 7.10.       In reply to a question, THE SECRETARY OFSTATE ::&apos;0R FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that the politicaldiscussions with Turkey were proceeding and thatthe Foreign Office took a hopeful view of theiroutcome.   He thought, however, that considerabledifficulty would he experienced in dealing withthe negotiations on financial subjects.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat if a limited sum of money could be madeavailable to cushion the compensation scheme,definite advantages would accrue to us from thecommercial point of view.THE SECRETARY 03?&apos; STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he hoped that when this matter came tobe considered it would be borne in mind that Turkey was a &quot;key&quot; Power and that it was essential to retainher friendship.THE CABINET took note of this statement.- 17 -

^Defense of.ablnet 34 (39)onolusion 3.)11. THE SECRETARY OF STA E FOR india reminded his colleagues that at the meeting of the cabinet referred to in the margin,it had been agreed that,while the Chatfield Report and the decisions reachedupon it should not be published as a whole, it wouldbe necessary to publish a carefully-worded despatch from himself to the Viceroy, which would contain asmuch of the Chatfield Report as it was decided shouldbe made public.     Since this procedure had been agreedupon, circumstances had arisen which made it desirablethat this despatch should be published as soon aspossible.     At the meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence held on 21st July (C.I.D. 367thMeeting) it had been decided that force &quot;Heron&quot;should be sent from India to Egypt and force &quot;Emu&quot;and two bomber squadrons from India to Singapore.The orders for the move of the first-named force had been issued and troop movements were taking plaeeIn India.     These troop movements were alreadygiving rise to speculation in the Press, where theyhad been linked up with the Report of Lord Chatfield1sCommittee.The Secretary of State said that a despatchhad been drafted and sent to the Treasury who, he gathered, concurred generally in its terms, subjectpossibly to minor drafting amendments, and it wouldbe sent that day to the Viceroy by air mail.     As,however, the Government of India as a whole had notyet seen the Chatfield Report, it was clear thatsome days must be allowed for consideration of thematter, and he thought that the earliest date on

which the despatch could &quot;be published would be^ the10th August.Another reason why it was desirable that thedespatch to the Viceroy on the Chatfield report should be published was that it was contemplate under the proposals in the Chatfield Report that ifthe forces held in India for her external defence were used outside India in an emergency affecting India&apos;external security, their ordinary maintenance charges should be borne by India, the apportionment of the extra charges between Imperial and Indian funds being agreed by the two Governments at the time.      It was desirable that this recommendation should be made known in India, since otherwise it would be claimed that Indian troops were being used for the Imperialpurposes of His Majesty&apos;s Government.      It would beseen, when the draft despatch was published, that india had received valuable consideration for the adoptionof this proposal in the shape of the increase in theGarran Grant and in the assistance to be afforded fromthe British Exchequer towards the capital cost of re-organising and modernising the forces in India.For these reasons the Secretary of State forIndia thought it desirable that the draft despatch to the Viceroy should be published as soon as possible.This course was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA then referredto the conclusion reached at the Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on the 21st July, namely, thatthe date of the despatch of force &quot;Emu&quot; and the two     .bomber squadrons from India to Singapore should be

left open pending the agreement of the. Government of india as to the principles which should govern the cost ofIndian troops when employed&quot;outside India in defence ofIndia&apos;s external commitments.  He thought that, if there wasa real militaryinecessity for this move, he should be,,authorised to arrange for this brigade and the two bomber squadrons to leave at once,    Otherwise it would not bepossible for them to leave until the middle ^o,f August,, inwhich event they would not reach Singapore until the ^ginningof September.      He felt no doubt that the Government ofIndia would accept the principle set out in the ChatfleldReport, to which he had already referred, that the normalcost of these troops should be charged against Indianrevenues.     He pointed out that Defence was a reservedsubject and that, if need be, steps could be taken toensure that this recommendation went through.In the light of this explanation, it was agreed,after some further discussion, that immediate orders shouldbe issued for the despatch of force &quot;Emu&quot; and two bomber squadrons from India to Singapore.The Cabinet agreed:(l)   To authorise the Secretary of State forIndia to publish a despatch   from himself to the Viceroy containing as much of the chatfield Report,and the decisions of theGovernment thereon, as it was desiredshould be made public:(2)   That, having regard to the assurance givenby the Secretary of State for India thatthe Government of India would be preparedto accept as a charge against the Indianrevenues the normal cost of the forces tobe despatched to Singapore (the apportionmentof the extra charges being aLmatter for agreementbetween the two Governments), orders shouldbe issued forthwith for the despatch of force&quot;Emu&quot; and two bomber squadrons from Indiato Singapore.

COORDINATIONP&apos;DEFENCEROGSAMHES:;previous reference:cabinet 3639), Con-conclusion 2),12.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Prime Minister (CP.-166 (39)) in which attention was drawn to the frequent submissions made, during thepreceding months, by the Defence Departments to theTreasury and the Cabinet for large and costlyadditions to the programmes previously authorised.It was clearly undesirable, from the financial pointof view, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldbe called upon to consider large demands from one service without knowledge that other large demandsmight before long be submitted to him by other services.     The need for considering the defence programmes as a whole was reinforced, moreover, ifthe matter were considered from the point of view ofavailability of labour supply and of industrial resources, por example, unless the Government were ina position to envisage the situation as a whole fromthe point of view of demands on labour and manufacturingresources, there was grave risk that any increases orextensions of existing programmes which might hereafterbe sanctioned would result in delaying progress onprojects previously authorised.To meet this situation, the Prime minister proposed that, if any of the Defence Departments, orthe Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Office, made new proposalsinvolving heavy demands on labour, manufacturing capacity or finance, over and above the demandsnecessitated by the programmes already authorised,those proposals should be considered by a Ministerial

Committees composed, as follows:-The Prime Minister (Chairman),The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(Deputy Chairman),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The three Service Ministers,The Minister of Supply,The Lord Privy Seal, andThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster(other Ministers being co-opted as necessary).The first task of this Committee would be to satisfy themselves whether any substantial demands likely tobe submitted in the near future by any of the service departments or for Civil Defence, involved calls on labour and manufacturing capacity beyond the resources which could be made available fon the Defence services or for Civil Defence,      In order to enable the ministerial Committee to obtain the necessary information for this purpose, the Prime minister proposed that an Inter-Departmental Committee shouldbe appointed, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, comprising official representatives of:-The Admiralty,The Air Ministry,The War Office,The Ministry of Supply,The Lord privy Sealfs Office,The Board of Trade,The Ministry of Labour,The Treasury,,When the Ministerial Committee had received the Reportof the Inter-Departmental Committee and had ascertainedwhether the programmes proposed were within theavailable production and labour resources, it would benecessary for it to consider the wider issues, namely,how the programmes which came before them should be

fitted into the &quot;balanced scheme of Defence, covering the whole range of our defence preparations, and taking into account our strategical needs and our financial strength.    Following the precedent of ordinaryMeetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence, thePrime Minister proposed that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should preside at Meetingsof the Committee when questions affecting labour supply and industrial capacity were under investigation,while the Prime Minister would preside when the widerissues were under discussion,,      The proposals in thePrime Minister&apos;s Memorandum were intended to belimited in the first instance to the needs of theimmediate situation, namely, proposals for new projects or additional acceleration which might bemade before the following March.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that this matter had arisen out of a discussion on certain Admiraltyproposals at the Committee of Imperial Defence.     he understood that certain proposals might shortly be coming forward from the Air Ministry which might make considerabledemands on our productive resources.     He thought these should be dealt with by the proposed Ministerial Committee.The Prime Minister explained that it would be important that the Minister of Labour and the Presidentof the Board of Trade should be able to assist theCommittee.     Again, the Foreign Secretary, while no doubthe could not spare the time to be a member of the Committee,might wish to attend on occasions.     It was with these considerations in mind that he (the Prime Minister) had proposed that there should be a power of co-opting other ministers as necessary.

THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said that in the preceding months three major defence problems had arisen, namely - (l) the extrarequirements for the Army which had been dealt with bya Committee with the Prime Minister in the Chair;(2) certain extra requirements for the Air Ministrywhich had been dealt with by the Secretary of Statedirect with the Chancellor of the Exchequer:    (3) various proposals from the Admiralty which had been consideredquite recently.     He strongly favoured consideration ofsuch additions to the programmes by the method proposed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR ashed how theproposed Committee would affect the working of theCommittee of Imperial Defence.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence, the three service Ministers and the Minister of Supply would berepresented on the Committee and it would be possibleto obtain the views of the three Chiefs of Staff on anystrategic issues, if this were desired.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he assumed that the phrases in the Memorandum whichreferred to the availability of labour supply and ofindustrial resources envisaged that it might benecessary to consider priorities not merely betweenthe needs of the Service Departments themselves butalso between those needs and the needs of civilianindustry.      It might well be that certain articles werebeing made for civil consumption which should not bemade at the present time.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that it would benecessary to consider the productive capacity of thecountry as a whole and to what extent new needs could bemade by encroaching on civil work.

THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY agreed with, theproposals which he thought would r,E et an importantrequirement. .Some discussion ensued as to the departments which should he represented on the Inter-departmentalCommittee suggested in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESexpressed the wish that his Department should herepresented.     He was anxious to ensure that agricultural needs were sufficiently taken into account in the siting of defence works or new factories.It was explained that this Committee would hemainly concerned with new programmes rather than anyparticular sites, hut it would be for the committee itself to determine whether a particular problem should be dealt with in general terms or by relationto the proposed siting of any particular factory ordefence establishment.In the course of discussion, it was suggestedthat the Ministry of Health and the Scottish office should also be represented.      It was finally agreed thatthe best way for dealing with this matter would be thatthe Chairman of the Committee should have the option toco-opt the representatives of other Departments as andwhen necessary.The Cabinet approved the proposals set outin the Prime Minister&apos;s Memorandum(CP. 166 (39)) for the establishment of a ministerial Committee (to be assisted by a departmental Committee) to deal with theco-ordination of defence programmes, subjectto the modification that the Chairman of theInter-departmental Committee should have theright to co^-opt representatives of otherDepartments as and when necessary.

&amp; s$CE BILLREGULA-S.rt ofnetittee.viouserence:inet 36), Con-sion 1.)13. - The Cabinet had under consideration the Report(C .P.-160 ( 39)) of the Cabinet Committee appointed atthe Meeting noted in the margin to examine the detailed arrangements for giving effect to the decision reached by the Cabinet on the 17th May, 1939,  (Cabinet 28 (39),Conclusion 8), that Defence Regulations should be heldready for issue before an actual outbreak of war, ifnecessary in advance of the passing of the emergency powers (Defence) Billo     At the end of their Report theCommittee (which had examined this matter with theassistance of the War Legislation Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence) summarised their recommenda-tions as follows:-&quot; (a) The enabling legislation providing statutory authority for the Defence Regulations shouldbe in the form of the Ernergency Powers(Defence) Bill attached as Appendix I to theReport, which should be introduced at the sametime as, or as soon as possible after, thefirst issue of Defence Regulations.(b) The Defence Regulations should be held in readiness in four codes:-(1) Code A, for issue at the onset of anemergency;(2) Code B, for issue as a supplement toCodeafter the outbreak of hostilities;(3) Code AB, for- issue after the outbreak ofhostilities if Code A had not alreadybeen issued; and(4) The Defence (Finance) Regulations, to beissued either before or after theoutbreak of hostilities, at the moment when financial polic3r required it.(c) The times for the issue of the various Codesof Regulations, and for the introduction into parliament of the Emergency Powers (Defence)Bill, should be matters for Cabinet decisionwhen an emergency threatened;    Code A mightbe required at the stage when evacuation ofthe civil population was ordered, or at the stage when the anti-aircraft defences were-fully manned.

(d) On the assumption that the above recommenda-tions were accepted, provision should bemade in the Government War Book&quot;for putting them into effect.(e) The numbering of the Regulations should bestereotyped for some time to comej    if regulation became unnecessary, a gapshould be left in the numbering and an indication given that the Regulation hadbeen cancelled.In the course of explaining the main points ofthe Report, THE HOME SECRETARY referred to theimportant suggestion made by the Lord chancellor at the Meeting of the Cabinet on the 17th May(Cabinet 28 (39), Conclusion 8) that a one-clauseBill should be passed in peace time conferring onThe King the prerogative right by Order in Councilto take such steps as might be necessary for the safety of the Realm if the risk of immediatehostilities was imminent.,    The conclusion reachedhad been that the objections to a short Bill, onthe lines proposed, were even greater than theobjections to the introduction in peace time of along Bill.   Briefly, the short Bill would be opento the same objections as a long Bill from the pointof view of public opinion, but it would not contain the detailed safeguards which would be set out inthe long Bill.    In any event, at the present junctureParliamentary time was not available to introduce aBill on the lines proposed, and for the present, atany rate, he thought it was essential to act onthe basis set out in the Report of the CabinetCommittee.The Committee had also reached the conclusionthat it was better that the Regulations should bemade by Order in Council, which would, be validatedsubsequently by the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act,

rather than that the Departments should take action without cover of any kind.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the Cabinet would appreciate that, as a Lord Chancellor and as a Judge,he could not approve  a procedure which was wholly illegal.He thought that only the most absolute neaessity could excuseThe King being advised&quot;to approve Orders in Council vfaLch wereultra vires .   While certain circumstances mightexeuse wholly illegal acts, they did not, in his view,justify them.The Lord Chancellor added that he could not agree that the short Bill,which he had himself drafted,was open to the objections which had been urgedagainst it.   He thought that it was a real defect in ourconstitution that if Parliament was ad journed or proroguedor if a dissolution had. taken place, there was no statutory authority enabling steps to be taken for the protection cf the realm in the event of an emergency.   While he agreedthat, for the time being, the course proposed, was theonly, one open to the Government, he hoped that afterthe Recess further consideration would be given toremedying this serious defect incur-cer^ituttanalprocedure.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said, that, while he had not had. the benefit of seeing the Bill drafted by the Lord Chancellor, he had alwaysbeen one of those who had taken the view that itwould be desirable to pass the Emergency Powers(Defence) Bill before an emergency took place.   Hewas in favour, therefore, o^ conferring upon the executive in peace e time,     powers to deal with the situa-tion which would, arise in an emergency, and he thoughtthat public opinion would now be ready to accept this step.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS doubted whether Parliament would view the matter In this light.He thought that the debate that afternoon on thePrevention of Violence ( Temporary Pro vis i-o-ns.) -bill might throw some light on this matter.THE SECRETARY&apos;OP STATE FOR AIR said, that hethought grave difficulty would he experienced in regardto the Defence Regulations which related to thePress, if the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill wasto be passed in time of peace.   He also reminded his colleagues that if an attempt were made to pass the 17ill into law in time of peace, there was therisk that the powers asked for might be made subjectto conditions or stipulations which would hamper theauthorities .THE CHANCELLOR OF ^E EXCHEQUER agreed thatthe Report of the Cabinet Committee should be approvesas the procedure to ^e adopted in the event of anemergency taking place in the near future.   For his part, he thought he would prefer to risk the possibility that it might ^e necessary to make Orders in Councilin advance of the passing of the Emergency Powers(Def once) Bill, rather than to attempt to confer uponthe Executive in time of peace the tremendous powers which that Bill contained..The Chancellor of the Exchequer also said, thata financial crisis might arise in advance of theoutbreak o* hostilities, and that immediate action might be necessary.   He therefore asked that heshould   be authorised to arrange for the issue, underthe authority of an Order in Council of the FinancialRegulations after consultation with the Prime Ministerand without-obtaining the prior sanction of the Cabinet.This course was agreed to.

The Cabinet agreed  To approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee on the Defence Bill and regulations, as summarised above,subject to the following points:-(a) That if a situation of great urgencyarose, the Chancellor of the exchequer should be authorised to arrange for theissue under the authority of an Order inCouncil of the Defence (Finance) Regulations,after consultation with the Prime Ministerbut without reference to the Cabinet.(b) That the adoption of this r ecommendatior.should not prejudice further considerationafter the Recess of the Lord Chancellor&apos;suggestion that a Bill should be passed, inGime of peace, to enable the Government ofthe day to make Orders for the safety ofthe Realm in the event of Parliament atthe time being adjourned, prorogued ordissolved.

14.        The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (C.P.-165(39)) in which he stated that, in conjunction withthe Minister of Supply and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, he had had under review theextent of the Government Reserves of Pood and RawMaterials, particularly with reference to the representations on this subject received from sir arthur Salter, M.P. and Mr. L.S. Amery, M.P.,and the Bulletin recently published by the Air RaidDefence League entitled &quot;Pood in War Time&quot;.     Theproposals put forward from these and other quarterswere, in effect, that the Government should at oncebring to this country the maximum quantity, for which shipping space could be found, of those foodstuffs and raw materials which would be required in timeof war. partly with a view to adding to our war reserves, but also with the object of saving shippingtonnage once hostilities had begun.     After describing the policy hitherto followed, the Memorandum statedthat in their review of the size of the Governmentreserves,the Ministers had considered to what extent they might wisely be increased so as to save shippingtonnage on the outbreak of hostilities.      The scopeof their review had been restricted to a short-rangepolicy, i*e., to what extent additional reserves ofraw materials and food, over and above those already authorised, could be purchased by the Ministry ofSupply and the Pood (Defence Plans) Departmentrespectively, to arrive in this country not later than the 15th October next;    but they consideredthat a careful review of our long-range storagepolicy should be made in the coming Autumn.

The Ministers summarised the result of their examination in two Annexes attached to theMemorandum.     Annex I contained a list of rawmaterials for which storage accommodation mightbe found, and of which additional Governmentreserves above those already authorised mightbe purchased without reduction of commercialstocks or undue interference with normal supplies.Annex II comprised a list of foodstuffs for whichstorage accommodation could be found in the UnitedKingdom, and of which Government reserves, over and above those already authorised, could be purchasedwithout reduction of commercial stocks.     TheMinisters considered that there was a good case for obtaining the additional reserves set out in theseannexes.     They accordingly recommended  &quot;(i) That approval should be given to theimmediate purchase of the supplies shownin the Annexes to their Memorandum (or so much of them as the Departmentsconcerned could, after further enquiries,arrange to be delivered to this country at a date not materially later than 15thOctober next), the total cost not to exceed for raw materials  15 millions,and for food supplies  5 millions;(ii)    That the Committee of Imperial defence should arrange for a further review tobe made of our long-term storage policy for both food supplies and raw materials in the early Autumn.&quot;

In the course of an Introductory statement,THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEexplained the main points in his Memorandum.He said that the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster now had more up-to-date information inregard to the sugar position.    The proposals setout in his Memorandum represented what could hedone on a short range policy.    These proposalsdid not constitute a final programme hut, if theCabinet approved them in principle, it would thenbe necessary for items to be discussed with theDepartments concerned, including the Treasury.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatif the purchases were to be made, they should be madeas quickly as possible as the markets were nowfavourable.    He had been informed that a proportionof the food now in storage in old warehouses,particularly at Bristol, was deteriorating rapidlyowing to infection by pests.    He asked that thefullest use should be made of- the scientists whowere now studying these pests.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that the wheat which was exposed to infectionby pests was that which had been bought from Roumaniaon grounds of high policy.    Broadly, our wheat reserves in this country were being turned over with very littleloss owing to deterioration,  although it was truethat there had been some loss in the Bristol warehouses.

l 5 0THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESstressed the importance of interdepartmental dis-cussions before the purchases were decided upon.For example, the proposed purchases of frozen meatwould have to be very carefully arranged if theywere not to have a disastrous affect on the marketwhen the stocks came to be turned over.    He alsourged that further consideration should be given to increasing reserves of normal animal feeding stuffs,especially those which would keep the dairy industrygoing in time of war.&apos; THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE, while in general agreement with the proposals in theMemorandum, thought that interdepartmental discussion would be necessary on a number of individual items.He questioned the inclusion of butter among the commodities to be bought for reserve,  on the grounds that butter would be a luxury in time of war andthat its transport occupied very little tonnage.Surely it would be better to concentrate on purchases of commodities which would last longer and whichoccupied more tonnage.    There was also the danger that by buying reserves quickly, the Government wouldbe competing with the normal importers and buyingstocks which would otherwise be imported in the normal course of trade.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said all these pointshad been in the mind of those who had framed theMemorandum.    He hoped that the proposals would re-ceive general approval.    He thought that it was

&apos;ij  JLimpossible to justify a position in which therewas empty storage in this country at a time ofinternational tensionsTHE CHANCELLOR CP THE DUCHY OP lancaster said that the conservation of shipping spacehad been one of the most important factors takeninto account in framing the proposals.     Sincethe Memorandum had been drafted, the positionin regard to sugar had been further investigated.It was now found that it would be possible topurchase 100,000 tons of raw sugar for deliveryin September and October.     This stock would beplaced temporarily in warehouses owned by Tateand Lyle and the British Sugar Corporation.It was true that most of this stock would comefrom Cuba and Java, but, while this was not attractivefrom the exchange point of view, the transactionwould only represent an anticipation of purchases from these countries since Tate and Lyle would beable to take over the stocks early in 1941and replace them by purchases from Empire countries.The question whether sugar could not be purchased from Mauritius was raised and theCHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER undertook to investigate this point.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH stressed the importance,from the health point of view, of reserves of animal .feeding stuffs, which would safeguard our milk supplies.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTERexplained that the difficulty was that there was insufficient storage capacity in this country at thepresent time for animal feeding stuffs.     He undertook to consider a suggestion that empty cotton millsmight be used for storage.THE SECRETARY OP STATS POR FOREIGN AFFAIRShoped that when these purchases were considered indetail, regard would be paid to the claims of countries in South East Europe which were politicallyof great importance to us.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hethought it would be generally agreed that the detailsin regard to the proposed purchases could not besettled in Cabinet.   He was prepared to agree thatgeneral approval should be given to the proposal thatthe reserves of raw materials and food supplies in thiscountry should be increased, on the lines which hadbeen indicated,  subject to each case being examined onits merits by the Departments concerned, includingthe Treasury.      In particular, the proposal topurchase large quantities of sugar $vhich he agreed should be included among the purchases which should be examined by Departments) would require specialinvestigation.     Another important point was whetherthe proposed purchases would involve a strain on the dollar exchange.      He instanced the proposedpurchases of lard from the United States.The Cabinet agreed -To approve in principle the proposal that immediate purchases of suppliesof raw materials and food stuffsshould be made on the general lines indicated in Annex I and Annex II tothe Memorandum appended to CP. 165(39) subject to the conditions -

(i) That the total cost should notexceed in the case of rawmaterials  15 million, and in thecase of food supplies  5 million.(ii) That the details of each of theproposed purchases should he thesubject of consideration by theDepartments concerned,includingthe Treasury.(iii) That the Committee of Imperial defence should arrange for a further review to be made of our long-term storage policy for both food supplies and raw materials, in theearly autumn.- 37 -

gPRESSEDAS&quot;,port ofpreviousHeference:Cabinet 60(38), Con-clusion 1515.       The Cabinet had under consideration a Noteby the Prime Minister (CP.-161 (3b)) regarding the Reportof the Depressed Areas Committee.    In the previousNovember, the Committee had decided that, an an interim measure, the Special Areas Acts should be continued for) another year by means of the Expiring Laws continuance bill, and that something should be done to meet theclaim that the Government ought no longer to confineassistance to the Special Areas as scheduled in the 1934Special Areas Act, but should assist the development ofnew industries in areas of heavy unemployment, whether in or outside the technical Special Areas.One of the methods which had proved of gratest value in the development of industry in Special Areas hadbeen the provision of loan facilities for the establishmentof new industries, and the Committee had accordingly decided that it would be desirable to introduce legislation to provide such facilities in areas of heavy unemployment, tohe defined not by a geographical schedule but by a seriesof conditions.    It had hardly seemed necessary to reportthis decision to the Cabinet, but action had been takento include the Special Areas Acts for one year in the expiring Laws Continuance Bill, and the Minister ofLabour had announced the Governments intention tointroduce legislation at an early date to provide loanfacilities.   On the 11th July the Chancellor of theExchequer had announced that the Bill was in course of preparation, that he hoped it might be possible tointroduce it before the House rose for the Summer Recess,and that, if there was general agreement, it might toepossible to carry the measure before the end of the session.

cs     V-iiince the Cabinet Committee had considered thematter, however,, the unemployment position had undergonea complete change, and if the matter were to be considerednow entirely on its merits, without regard to past pledges,it was doubtful whether such legislation would be justified.In view, however, of the pledges given, it was clear thatthe Bill should be introduced at the earliest possible date.   The Cabinet Committee had not had time to meet and consider the actual terms of the Bill, but it had approved the Joint proposals by the Minister of Labour and theSecretary of State for Scotland on which the Bill was founded.   The main provisions of the Bill (of which a copywas attached to the Prime Minister&apos;s Note) were as follows:-(i) The Treasury to be empowered up to March1942 to agree to make loans to new undertakings to be established in areas of heavy unemployment.The total sum to be available was not specified,but there was to be a limit of  200,000 for anyone loan.(ii) Loans were only to be made for industriesestablished in areas of heavy unemployment which were defined in 01;use 1 of the Bill.It would be noted that th^ Bill deliberatelymade no reference at all to the Special Areas,nor would the definition of &quot;areas&quot; include large cities such as Glasgow or Liverpool.(iii) In order that the Government may be assured thatapplications had local support and were not likely to conflict with existing industries inthe areas, it was provided .that the initiativeshould rest with a Local Development council which would be required to introduce the industryto a small Advisory Committee, appointed by theTreasury; if it thought the application meritedconsideration, the Committee would ascertain from the Ministry of Labour whether the areaproposed fell within the definition of an areaof heavy unemployment in the Bill.    If so, theAdvisory Committee would examine the merits ofthe application from an industrial and financialstandpoint.    The Treasury would not be empoweredto make any loan except upon the advice of thisCommittee.The Prime Minister accordingly recommended that -

(i) subject to consideration and approval by theCommittee of Home Affairs, the Bill shouldbe introduced before the House rose for the summer Recess:(ii) the Government should attempt to get the bill passed during the current Session.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed:-That the proposed Bill be introduced in the House of Commons -(i) before the Summer Recess;(ii) without further reference to the Cabinet,subject, however, to the approval of theHome Affairs Committee.- 40 -

hi o i16.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-164 (39))regarding the Claim for Spinsters&apos; Pensions, in whichit was recalled that, as a result of agitation by a body known as the Rational Spinsters&apos; PensionsAssociation, which had received considerable support in the House of Commons, it had been decided, earlyin 1938, to set up a Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. CT. Le Quesne, K.C, &quot;to examine and reporton the complaints which are made as to the positionof unmarried women under the Contributory PensionsActs and on the practical questions which would arise if the age at which Old Age Pensions under those Actsare payable to unmarried women were lowered&quot;.     TheCommittee had submitted their Report in March ofthe current year, and a summary of it was attached asan Appendix to the Memorandum.It was quite clear that the Committee hadnot endorsed any of the main contentions of thespinsters and their champions.     The NationalSpinsters&apos; Pensions Association were, however,actively pursuing their campaign, in spite of theReport of the Committee.-     A resolution concerningSpinsters1 Pensions had been tabled in the Houseof Commons in the name of 199 Members, pressing for revision of the amount and conditions of existingpensions and urging the Government to take into special consideration the claim of spinsters for pensionsat an earlier age.     The Government must,therefore,reach a decision on the merits of this claim.

Apart from the fact that the claims of theAssociation had been rejected by an independent committee, the initial cost of meeting them wouldbe about  4,400,000 a year.      The Chancelloragreed also with the view of the Committee that, ifit were decided at this cost to grant a pension tospinsters at 55, it would be impracticable to withholdit from other classes of insured women;   and, further,that the demand for pensions at 55 for the wives ofpensioner husbands would be almost impossible to resist.     These consequential extensions would increase the initial cost of the concession to some 14 millions a year.The Chancellor therefore recommended that, if and when the Government were asked for their iews about the claimcf the spinsters, they should say thatthe claim had been referred for consideration by anindependent and impartial Committee, which had cometo the conclusion that the Spinsters&apos; PensionsAssociation had failed to make their case;    thatthe Government were prepared in the main to acceptthe view of this Committee, and were not prepared tointroduce legislation to provide pensions forspinsters under more favourable conditions than nowoperated.     If pressed to express an opinionupon certain minor points in respect of which theReport was critical of the Government, it couldbe said that these were technical matters whichwould require careful consideration, but did notcall for airy immediate action.

iC eJ 9THE PRIME MINISTER referred/to the pro^oal-in.paragraph 5 of the Chancellor*s Memorandum-- that theGovernment should state that they had referred.thespinsters1 claim for consideration by an independent and impartial Committee, and that that Committee had come tothe conclusion that the Spinsters Pension association had failed to make their case.     In the meantime, theOpposition had put down a vote of censure on theGovernment for their refusal to provide the ways and meansId Age for the improvement and extension of Old Age Pensions,ensions.The claims in this matter had been skilfully worked upthroughout the country and the Labour Parts&apos;&quot; was nowputting forward a scheme for a pension of  1 per week to a man and 35/- to a married couple, the v/ife to be eligible to receive her pension on reaching the age of55 provided that her husband was over 65 and had retiredfrom work.      This scheme would involve an expenditure inthe neighbourhood of  80 or  90 millions a year.     Thesuperficial attractiveness of this scheme was obvious and interest in it was heightened by rumours of an impendinggeneral election.     The matter was now being activelycanvassed in the constituencies.       It was known that agitation in this matter had not confined itself tothe Labour and Liberal Opposition but had spread to someof the Government back-benchers.     A number of government supporters had committed themselves to the view that theGovernment should take some action on the matter.The Prime Minister said that he had taken these considerations into account in determining the line whichhe should take in replying to the Leader of the opposition in the debate on the ensuing day.     He proposed to speak on the following lines.     Pirst, that the Government hadevery sympathy with the hardships of the old people of

this country.      Secondly^ he proposed to set out whatthe Government had already done for the improvement of social services so as to show that their sympathy was ofa practical hind.      In the third place he would indicatethat the reason why he was not prepared to give an affirmative answer to the claims put forward was not fromany lack of sympathy for the old people of this countryhut because we had to consider our responsibilities inother directions.     In particular, we were in the middleof a rearmament programme which involved very heavy expenditure.      In this connection, the Prime minister proposed to make clear a point which he thought wasinsufficiently appreciated by Members of Parliamentgeneralise&quot;, namely, that from the financial point of view the most serious part of the defence programme was notthe immediate capital expenditure but the cost ofmaintenance of the expanded force when the rearmament programme was over.     He proposed to explain that onthe present level of taxation we could find some  250millions a year for the maintenance of the Defence Forces.When, however, the additions to those forces now inprogress had been completed, the annual cost ofmaintenance might be as much as  100 or  200 millions ayear over the figure now found out of taxation.      Thisheavy additional sum would also have to be found out oftaxation.     He thought that nothing less than a statement on these lines would convince the House of Commons of theimpracticability of adding a large sum to our pensionliabilities at the present time.The Prime Minister thought it would be desirableto add that, while it was clearly out of the question toassume any very large additional burden on account of improvements in pensions, it must not be inferred that itwas impossible to do anything by way of adjustment or- 44 -

improvement of the existing scheme.     Although therewere many calls fox* improvements in the social services,there seemed to be a general desire to concentrate onimprovements in old age pensions and the Government was disposed to follow this lead.      It was therefore proposedthat the Government should set up an enquiry to examinewhat was practicable in the way of improvement in old age pensions, subject to the condition that the exchequer could not shoulder any substantial additional burden.It would therefore appear that the extent of what couldbe done would depend largely on how far the workers and employers were prepared to pay additional contributions.It was therefore proposed to appoint an independent committee comprising representatives of employers and workers with some representatives of the general public and an impartial Chairman.     He would propose that aCommittee on these lines should be set up with instructionsto report in the Autumn.The Prime Minister said he would welcome the observations of his colleagues on the px^oposed lines ofhis speech.     He was satisfied that there would bedissatisfaction on the part of a considerable number ofGovernment followers if the Government were to refuse totake any action in the matter, and the result would be a somewhat damaging debate.The Prime Minister said that while he was not ofcourse committed to any specific improvements, there were two points which he thought merited serious consideration.The first was the case of a man of 65 who had a wife verymuch younger than himself.     Would It be possible toprovide that the wife would be eligible for old age pension on reaching the age of, say, 60?     The second point was that while most old age pensioners had some other

source of income, there were a number who had not, andwho nevertheless felt very reluctant to apply to thePublic Assistance Authorities.     While it would bedifficult to alter this position, there was no doubtthat a change in this respect would meet with general approval.     He thought this point might also be examined.In the course of discussion, the main -pointdealt with was the form of Committee proposed.     It was first suggested that it would be undesirable to have anindependent Committee and that it would be preferable toset up a Cabinet Committee.     A situation might arise in which it would be somewhat embarrassing to theGovernment to have appointed a Committee which mightnot have reported.     It was also urged that, while in normal circumstances there was much to be said forappointing a Committee with representatives of Employersand Workers, in the present case   the official representatives of the Workers were all committed tothe Labour Party Scheme and some other form of inquiry would be preferable.On the other hand, the view was expressed thatit would be unwise to say that a Committee of cabinet ministers was being appointed and that the right coursewould be to adopt some general phrase to the effect thatthe Government were arranging for the position to be reviewed.     It was also urged in favour of the adoptionof some such phrase as &quot;that the Government is enquiringinto the matter&quot; (rather than the appointment of anindependent Committee) that the condition mentioned bythe Prime Minister, namely, that the Exchequer could notshoulder any substantial burden, was not one which wouldbe capable of easy definition in formal terms ofreference.

In this connection, THE MINISTER OF HEALTH saidthat his Department had plans and proposals in a forward state.jWhile proposals could he put forward rapidly to persons whowere familiar with the general position, if an independent committee of Inquiry could he appointed, some time mightelapse before they were ready to deal with the matter.The second point dealt with in discussion was whether an amendment should be moved from the GovernmentBenches.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Chief Whipexpressed the view that this course was not desirable.On the other hand, the view was expressed that it would heawkward for many of the Government supporters to vote against the Labour Party&apos;s Motion in view of the undertakingsIwhich they had given, notwithstanding the fact that thePrime Minister&apos;s speech would make it clear that theGovernment had not refused to provide the necessary ways and means for some improvement of Old Age Pensions.     Thepossibility of a manuscript amendment to be handed in at about 6 or 7 o1clock in the evening was mooted and the PrimeMinister agreed to discuss this point further with the chief whip.The Cabinet approved the general lines ofthe Prime Minister&apos;s proposed speech, subjectto the following points raised in discussion -(l) that the Prime Minister should indicatethat it is the intention of the Governmentto undertake a review of the Old age pensions position, but should not use words which imply the setting up of anindependent Committee of Inquiry or of aCommittee of Ministers;(2) that the Prime Minister should discuss withthe Chief Whip the question whether amanuscript amendment should be handed herein after  his speech.

OAP ACCIDENTS,regulation of17.The Cabinet had unde3^--oc^si6Ve*^tlon^a Meraorandumby the Minister of Transport (C.P.-158(39)) on thesubject of Road Accidents and the Regulation ofCyclists.      In his Memorandum the Minister stated thatin 1936 his predecessor had drawn the attention of theTransport Advisory Council to the increase in the numberof pedal cycles in use on the roads, and to the largenumber of accidents in which pedal cyclists were involved, and had invited them to consider and report upon any further practicable measures which, in theCouncil&apos;s opinion, might be adopted for the better pro-tec tion of cyclists and other road users.      The council had reported in June, 1938, but in the meantime theHouse of Lords Select Committee on the Prevention of road Accidents had been set up, and it had not been thought desirable to take any action on the transport advisory Council&apos;s Report until the Report of the SelectCommittee had also been received.      The Minister&apos;spredecessor had answered a parliamentary Question tothis effect on 27th July, 1938,  (Official Report,Col. 3112),The Select Committee had reported at the end ofMarch and had made a large number of recommendationsaffecting cyclists.      The Minister was being strongly pressed to announce the Governmentrs decision in regardto this Report, but as it contained over two hundredrecommendations, he had announced that he would issue a commentary on the whole Report in the form of a white paper.      In this document he proposed to give reasonsfor the rejection of many of the Select Committee&apos;s

recommendations, and-a . statement---of&quot;--the measures to &quot;betaken to implement those which it was.decided to accept.The Minister then outlined the more importantrecommendations of the Select Committee concerningcyclists, adding his comments thereon.      In conclusion,the Minister expressed the wish subject to the viewsof his colleagues,  to include in his statement on theSelect Committee&apos;s Report an announcement that, after consideration of the Reports of the Transport AdvisoryCouncil and of the Select Committee, he proposed tomake regulations, under his existing powers, regardingbells and the number and nature of the brakes on pedalcycles, and to introduce legislation as soon as pos&amp;ibledealing with the following matters:-(l) Carriage by pedal cyclists of a form of identification disc,(2)  Introduction of a requirement that pedalcyclists must report accidents (on thelines of Section 22 of the Road traffic act,  1950).(S) Carriage of red rear lamps on pedal cycles.(4) Prohibition of the carrying of articles whichinterfered with the control of the cycleor the view of the road.(5) Compulsory use of cycle tracks where theywere satisfactory,,(6) Creation of the offence of carelessriding.In explaining the main points in his memorandum the MINISTER OP TRANSPORT said that the most difficultissue concerned the proposal to make compulsory the carriage of red rear lamps on pedal cycles.   Heoutlined the main arguments for and against thiseours e .The Minister said that since his memorandum had been drafted, he had. consulted the Law Offioersas to the proposal in paragraph 14 that the extinction

of a rear light should not be pleaded as an excuseor treated as contributory negligence if a cyclistwere run down.   The Law Officers had. advised that-this proposal was open to considerable objection,and thought that it would be much wiser to leave this aspect of the matter toy be dealt with on the^basis pfthe existing lav/,Continuing, the Minister said that he appreciated that this proposal might, give rise to serious opposition a.mong the Large body of cyclists, whonumbered 8 or 10 millions.   As aga.inst this, it mustbe pointed out that not only the Aliness committee but two other Inter-Departmental Committees, andthe Transport Advisory Council, had been in favour oithis proposa.1.   He also thought that opinion amongmotorists would be strongly in favour of this measure.   His reason for raising this matter at thepresent time was that he wa.s anxious to settlebefore the Pecess what conclusions should be reached in regard to the ma.in recommendations in the Al^nessReport.In the course of discussion the view was expressed, that it was not essential to deal with this very contentious matter at the present time, and thaton the whole the wisest course would be to deferdecisions on the questions raise? until after the recess.This course was agreed to.(The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the lord president of the Council left the Meeting at,this point.)

A/VA/EMOT 0 IRQUTjATED .fTHE INT3R-HATIONALSITUATION.Danzig.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(39), Con-clusion 3 .)MOST SECRET ADDENDUM TO ITEM 2 OFCABINET 59 (39).    26th JULYT 1939.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat Dr Burckhardt, the League of Nations commissioner in Danzig, had reported to him that he had recently had a discussion with Herr Forster, the Gauleiterof Danzig.   The latter had recently returned fromseeing Herr Hitler at Berehtesgaden, and reportedthat the German attitude in regard to Danzig was asfollows;   First, that Germany had not modified herclaims in regard to Danzig or the Corridor, asformulated in Herr Hitler&apos;s Reichstag speech.   Thiswas of interest, since previously it had. been implied that the terms then offered would no longer be accept-able.   Secondly, that nothing would be done on theGerman side to provoke a conflict.    Thirdly, thatthe question could wait, if necessary, until next year,or longer.   Fourthly, that the Senate would seek the help of the High Commissioner to smooth over difficul-ties between them and the Polish representatives,thus putting an end to a war of Notes.   Further, itwas indicated that if a detente could be brought about,all military measures now being taken in Danzig wouldbe stopped.It was of the utmost importance to maintainsecrecy as to these conversations.   We had thereforeinformed the Polish Government that we had information(the source of which we had not communicated to them)that the Germans were working for a detente, and that .it was of the utmost importance that they should directtheir endeavours to the same end.   We had also informedthem that we had. learned with regret of the recentfrontier incidents, and hoped that the Polish-1-

Government would handle them with the usual restraint and circumspection, and that they would not be deflect-ed by these incidents from the general policy of bringing about a detente.The Foreign Secretary said that generally theposition in regard to Danzig looked a bit steadier.It was, of course, difficult to know exactly whatvalue to attach to these latest statements in regardto the German attitude.   Did it mean that they were impressed by the firm attitude of the Peace Front?Was it a blind, to cover up their real motives?   Or didit mean that Germany was now directing her actionelsewhere?    In any case, however, it was clear thatthere could, be no possible harm in working for adetente at Danzig.
