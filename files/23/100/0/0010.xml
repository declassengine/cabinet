w the INTER-national situation.Danzig andGermany.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(39), Con-clusion 5).1.       THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had asked the Cabinet to meet again at short notice,not in order to invite them to take decisions, hutin order that they might be informed of the latest developments of the position.    This was particularly desirable in view of the meeting of both Houses ofParliament that afternoon.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS    said that his colleagues would have seen Herr Hitler&apos;s reply (Telegram Ho.  446).    TheForeign Secretary also referred to two recent telegrams from our Ambassador in Rome reporting the attitude of the Italian Government.    Certainparticulars in regard to these telegrams are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s standard file ofCabinet Conclusions. ATHE PRIME MINISTER referred to telegramNo.447 from Berlin, in which Sir Nevile Hendersonsaid that he had told the State Secretary at theGerman Foreign Office that the Prime Minister&apos;sletter and Herr Hitler&apos;s reply would not bepublished, and that it would scarcely be inaccordance with this promise if more than theminimum was said of their contents.    The PrimeMinister said that he had intended to read outthe text of the letters in the House of Commons,but that this was now obviously impossible.Nevertheless, he felt it would be necessary togive the gist of the letters.    This was all themore important since garbled versions of his ownletter were already current in Germany and theGerman people were being led to believe that

the letter contained threats only, with no constructive proposals.    This course was agreed to.The Prime Minister also agreed to a suggestionthat the text of the letters would probably have to bepublished in due course, but not at once.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRShoped that the Prime Minister would include in his speech a statement making it plain that it was notour intention to launch an attack on Germany unlessGermany herself started war.    He thought that this was important in view of the concluding passage of sir nevile Henderson&apos;s telegram No.443, in which he reportedHerr Hitler as saying that, if Great Britain tookfurther mobilisation measures, general mobilisationwould take place in Germany.   When Sir Nevile had asked whether this was a threat, Herr Hitler had replied - &quot;No, protection&quot;.    This point of view might seem fantastic to us, but not to public opinion inGermany.In the course of discussion reference wasmade to the fact that the Polish Ambassador to Germany,M. Lipski, had now returned to Berlin and had acceptedan invitation to shoot a stag in September with field marshal Goering.    It was suggested that, now thatM. Lipski had returned to Berlin, it might be possiblefor some negotiations to be started between Germanyand Poland in regard to minority questions, whichmight ease the tension.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSreplied that he had made a number of suggestions toM. Beck in the course of the last few days to the effect

that certain steps should he taken to deal withminority questions.    He thought it would he undesirable to press the suggestion further at the present stage,as this might involve some risk of loss of confidence in us by the Poles.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

3DTHE IIWEEiL^TIOlTALSITUATION (CONT&apos;D)Russia.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(39)Conclusion 3).2. THE SECRETARY OP STATE-FOR FOREIGN^.AFFAIRS said that he proposed to instruct sir William Seeds to ask M. Ivlolotoff whether in view of Article 4 of the terms of the russo--German Pact, the text of which was published that morning in the Press, M. Molotoffconsidered that Russia would be free to make arrangements with the French and British Governments,directed against Germany, in the event of Germanycommitting an act of aggression.     He thought we should be guided by the answer to thisquestion in deciding what action should be takenin regard to the Military Mission.  &quot; Action inthis matter would be taken in concert with theFrench.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in theHouse of Commons that afternoon he proposed tosay that we intended to reserve final judgment on the Russo-German Pact until we had had anopportunity of consulting with our French alliesas to the significance of whet had taken place.This., he thought, would afford an adequatereason for dealing somewhat lightly with thesubject at the present time.     He thoughts however,that he might add that it appeared to be contraryto good faith that, while we were corductingnegotiations with the Russians in all confidence,they should have been negotiating with Germanybehind our back.At a later stage in the meeting theForeign Secretary read out a telegram that had just been received from our Military Mission to

MoscoYif to the effect that they were proposing to leave Moscow at 10 o&apos;clock that night.The view was expressed that it would he desirable that Sir William Seeds should put the proposed question to M. Molotoffbefore the Mission actually left, althoughit was agreed that it was hard to see whatuseful purpose the Mission could now serve byremaining in Moecow.The Cabinet agreed with theaction proposed.

k 7THE ItfTERNATION&amp;ESITUATION (GONT&apos;D).-Policy in regardto Italy.(PreviousHeference:Cabinet 41(39)Conclusion 6).3. THE MINISTER POR CO-ORDINATION OPDEFENCE referred to the conclusion reached by theCabinet regarding the policy to be adopted towards Italy in the event of war breaking out and of Italy attempting to l^remain neutral.      TheCabinet had agreed that this matter should befurther considered by the Committee of ImperialDefence,  (D.P.(P) representation).     TheMinister said that the Chiefs of Staff had taken the opportunity of considering the question attheir meeting that morning.     The Chiefs ofStaff reaffirmed the views previously expressedin tliis matter, as set out in paragraph 8 of paper No. D.P.(P) 65.      As regards defence measures, the Chiefs of Staff thought that,while we should not neglect any measures whichcould be regarded as reasonable precautions tomeet the contingency of a hostile Italy, weshould not, on the other hand, adopt aprovocative attitude.The Minister also referred to a recenttelegram (No. 556) received from Paris fromwhich it appeared that the attitude of the FrenchGovernment in this matter coincided with our own.In these circumstances the Minister doubted ifthere was much to be gained by a further meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence at thepresent stage to consider this matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that it did not appear that there was now any point at issue which called for early decision.The Cabinet accepted the view thatthere was how no need for the matter to be reviewed by the Committee ofImperial Defence (D.P.(P) representation)as a matter of urgency.

ei the international situation (CONT^).Turkey.(previous reference:Cabinet 4l(39j,Conclusion 1.)4. Reference was made to Telegrarri No. 87from our Ambassador in Turkey, which had beenreceived the previous evening.      It was pointedout that this telegram referred to the economic pressure exercised by Germans&apos;&apos; and expressed the fear that this might lead Turkey to changeher foreign policy.In the course of discussion it waspointed out that the reference to economic pressure related to the proposal that Turkeyshould agree to cancel existing contracts forwar material with German firms, without claimingindemnity or enforcing penalties under the contracts.Reference was also made to the despatchof British war material to Turkey.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR saidthat the anti-aircraft guns for Turkey were now packed and ready for despatch, but there was at present no authority to despatch them.THE CHANCELLOR OP TEE EXCHEQUER saidthat he had communicated to the Foreign secretary the draft of a telegram to Angora dealing withthis matter.      While, as he had stated at theprevious meeting? he was anxious to cut out redtape, he thought it was essential to make sure that some arrangements for payment were made before the goods were despatched.      He hopedthat his proposals would meet the situation.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

DEFENCE MEASURES.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(39),Conclusion 6 andPage 1 of annex A.).5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR informed his colleagues that he had issued instructionsto call up Key Parties of all Coast Defence and anti-Aircraft Units immediately after the last meeting of the Cabinet. Instructions to callup tjie remainder of the Coast Defence and Anti-Air craft Units were now being issued, and mostof the personnel would be on duty that evening.The Cabinet took note ofthis statement.

FINANCIAL 6.       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referredMEASURES.to the announcement which had &quot;been made at 12 noon(previous reference:       that day that Bank Rate was being put up to 4 perCabinet 41(39), Con- cent. He also made a statement (a copy of which iselusion 7. )recorded on the Secretary&apos;s standard file of conclusions) in continuation of the statement madeat the meeting referred to in the margin.The Cabinet took note of the statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

iblFUTURE 1&apos;    THE PRIME MINISTER said that for theMEETINGSOF PARLIAMENT present the intention was that Parliament shouldAND OF THECABINET. adjourn until Thursday, 31st August, with power to recall it earlier should the situationso demand.    It was not practicable at the moment to fix the date of the next meeting of theCabinet.    In the meantime, his colleagues would no doubt remain available at short notice.The Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.,24th August, 1939.

NO CIRCULATION.MOST SECRET. CABINET 42(59) Item 6.FINANCIAL THE CHANCELLOR OP. THE EXCHEQUER said that measures.his colleagues would have seen the announcementmade at 12 noon that day that Bank Rate had been raised to 4 per cent.    This action has been taken asthe result of consultation late the previous evening,and was connected with the proposals in regard to our gold reserves which he had explained to his colleaguestwo days before.    It had been thought that the right course was to put up the Bank Rate that day.    the raising of the Bank Rate was a sign of our intentionto strengthen the pound by controlling the supply of credit and would do something to counteract any sense of weakness which might otherwise result when theExchange Fund ceased to operate.    Further, the raising of the Bank Rate would make it harder forspeculators to obtain money wherewith to speculateagainst sterling.    The steps which he had forecast on tuesday in regard to the Exchange Position wouldprobably be taken on the ensuing day (Friday).After a short discussion, the Cabinet took note and approved the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sstatement.

84th AugustT  1959ADDENDUM TO CABINET 42 (59),  CONCLUSION 1.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to two recent telegrams from our Ambassador-*       in Rome, Nos. 645 and 649, indicating the attitude ofthe Italian Government.    Copies of these two telegramsare attached.The Foreign Secretary said that after speaking to the Prime Minister he had telegraphed to Sir percy loraine to say that he did not think it was possiblefor His Majesty&apos;s Government to suggest to the PolishGovernment that they should negotiate with Germany onthe antecedent condition of the return of Danzig to the reich, unless  (a) The Polish Government could be assured that her independence and vital economicrights in Danzig would be secured:(b) That any arrangement so reached would beinternationally guaranteed.The Foreign Secretary said that he had asked sir Percy Loraine to express appreciation for signor mussolini&apos;s helpful attitude, and to indicate that ifSignor Mussolini could get Herr Hitler to agree to theseconditions there might be a possible basis for an approach to Poland.   At the same time, he thought itwas useless to make an approach to Poland unless theseconditions could be agreed to.The Cabinet expressed agreement with thecourse which had been adopted.

ft aSPECIAL DISTRIBUTION.DecypherSir P. Loraine.(Rome).23rd August, 1939.D.2.50 p.m.23rd August, 1939.R.56 p.m.23rd August, 1939.No.645.IMMEDIATE.Most -Secret.I sin now confident that Italy will not join with Germanyif Herr Hitler makes war.2.     It cannot be stressed too strongly that any suggestion in Parliament, press, radio etc., that we have reached this conclusion is calculated to wreck everything.3.     I nevertheless am of the opinion that our militaryauthorities can now base their dispositions for a war forced, onus by Germany, on the assumption of the Italians non-belligerency,but of course under seal of absolute secrecy.4.     It is vitally important that Signor Mussolini andCount Ciano should now have completely free hand and time toget out of their own mess in their own way.5.     Not repeated.

SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION AND CABINET,.Decyuher.    Sir p. Loraine (Rome).August 25rd 1959.D.   By Telephone. August 25rd 1959.R.    9.45 p.m. August 25rci 1959,.No. 649.MOST IMMEDIATE.SECRET.My telegram No. 643.I saw Count Ciano at 1.50 p.nu at bis request.   He told methat he had reported to Signor Mussolini my conversation with him of yesterday evening and had discussed the whole matter with theDuce.2.   He now wished to acquaint me for particular informationof the Prime Minister and Your Lordship with Signor Mussolini&apos;views.    Signor Mussolini wished us to understand that most absolutediscretion was necessary and begged this exchange of views solelybetween him and Your Lordship should be treated as highly[? grp. omtd.].   His position was clearly delicate as Italy wasall the same Germany&apos;s ally:   then there was the press:   andespecially if the French press winded anything we should he undone.[?Grp. omtd.] said we appreciated this situation and I assuredCount Ciano that he could rely on complete discretion at your end and on me to be wary with my colleagues,5.   Signor Mussolini wanted peace:   he was willing toco-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government in search for conditionsin which a peace by negotiation such as your message contemplatedcould

could be started.   Count Ciano added that he was very happyfor personal reasons to collaborate with me here.4.   In the Duce&apos;s opinion the situation was very graveindeed and had now reached a serious deadlock;;   and if - peacewas to be saved there was not a moment, to &quot;be lost.    So far h had made no communication to Berlin on lines of your message.He felt strongly however that only a new fact would enable him toact with any prospect of success in order [? grp. omtd.] deadlockand get things moving towards a peaceful solution.5.   The new fact which Bignor Mussolini had in mind as theonly one likely co serve this purpose was that Poland shouldfreely recognise right of German Free City to return to the Reich.Did His Majesty&apos;s Government think it possible to tender advice in this sense to Poland?   He himself felt it was [2 grps. undec.]that Herr Hitler would [grp. undec.] to Warsaw his acceptance of a negotiation and that unless he could hold out that much to herr hitler there was scant prospect of his being able to intervene with herr Hitler to any ^ood purpose.6.   If once a negotiation got started Signor Mussoliniundertook to use all his influence in Berlin towards obtaining a peaceful, fair and honourable settlement.7.    Signor Mussolini had specially noted wording of poiljtabout something to ensure loyal observance of agreements reached.He quite agrees that this, is necessary.   He would at the propermoment be willing to seek himself the most appropriate form of afull international guarantee against repudiation of any such agreements.

05.8.   Signor Mussolini thinks that if a negotiation can be gotunder way about Danzig it could and ought to he generalised and developed by a real peace conference to establish a stable anddurable situation which the conference of 1919 had failed to do.9.    I said I would at once transmit Signor Mussolini&apos;s ideasto you.    They were clearly very important and I knew the PrimeMinister and you would much appreciate Signor Mussolini&apos;swilling co-operationo    I., was myself happy to take note of themand it was not my intention to discuss them,    I nevertheless feltthat what Signor Mussolini suggested in paragraph 5 was difficultboth for His Majesty&apos;s Government and Poland.   There was no[grp. undec. ] for Poland:   and question of their non-political rights and interests in Danzig was [? left] in the air.10.    Coiait Ciano said that he hoped that the difficulty could he overcome:   for Signer Mussolini&apos;s definite feeling was that without that card to play he could not intervene effectively.   and meanwhile time pressed.    We had may be only to end of the week.
