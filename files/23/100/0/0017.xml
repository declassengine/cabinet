THE INTER-national situation.(Previous9 Reference.Cabinet 48 (39)Conclusion 1.)The Cabinet was called together at very short notice and a number of Ministers did notarrive until a considerable time after the pro-ceedings had started.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtthat all those present at the outset of the meeting,with the exception of the Foreign Secretary and theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence, had been present in his room in the House of Commons that afternoon.     He had little to add to what he thensaid as to the difficult position in which theGovernment had found themselves in the House and asto the reason which had led the Foreign Secretary .and himself to make an important departure in the statements which they had made from the line whichthe Cabinet had approved.The Prime Minister said that he recognised the strength of feeling shown in the House ofCommons, even among those who had been the mostloyal supporters of the Government.     It was dearlyneeessarj&apos;&apos; that a fresh effort should be made to correct the position, and he had taken immediate action to this end.     He and the Foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been havingfurther discussions with, the French Government.It appeared that the French General Staff had advised the French Government that an earlydeclaration of war would render them liable to attacks on their communications which they were not in aposition to resist, and might seriously endanger the concentration of their forces.     He had himselfspoken to M. Daladier on the telephone and had explained that there had been a painful scene in theHouse of Commons and that it would be impossible to

hold the position...i .,we,were-to ^continue to adhere-tothe line which M. Bonnet had told us that the FrenchGovernment intended to adopt.     The French Cabinet&apos;splan was that the two Ambassadors should together seek an appointment with Herr&apos; von Ribbentrop at 12 noon onthe following day (Sunday the 3rd September) and should inform him that they could not accept Count Ciano&apos;sproposals for a Conference, unless the position v/as firstrestored by the removal of German troops from Polish soil.The Ambassadors were to indicate that, if the GermanGovernment did not signify their acceptance of thisproposal, they would then deliver an ultimatum due to expire at about 8.0 or 9.0 p.m. on the same day (Sundaythe 3rd September).The Prime Minister had told M. Daladier that hecould not possibly accept this proposal, since it wouldbe impossible to hold the position in this country, andthat it v/as essential to deliver an ultimatum at an earlyhour.     He suggested delivery of the ultimatum at 8.0 a.m.,to expire at 12 noon.     M. Daladier had emphasised the strategic difficulties, and the advice given by his Staff,and had said that he would consider the matter and speak to the Prime Minister again at a later hour.The Prime Minister added that M. Corbin hadbeen present during this telephone conversation, and thatthe matter had been further discussed with him.It had then &quot;been decided that more pressuremust be put on the French Government, and that M. Bonnetshould be told that, if he could not accept our time forthe delivery and expiry of the ultimatum, we must ask himto consider the alternative of our Ambassador seeing Herrvon Ribbentrop alone, and of the French Ambassador going tosee Herr von Ribbentrop at a later hour in the morning,the assumption being that the French would take actionsimilar to ours, but some hours later.

The Foreign Secretary had sent a communicationin this sense to M. Bonnet.M. Bonnet had replied that the French Government-could not agree to the two Ambassadors visiting Herrvon Ribbentrop at 8.0 a.m.  on 3rd September.    He hadgravely deplored the suggestion that the British -Ambassador should see Herr von Ribbentrop separately from the French Ambassador, but had said that ifnecessary he would accept this conclusion regretfully,although it would have a bad effect on world opinion.The Prime Minister said that in the meantime the Chiefs of Staff had been assembled, and had beenasked to advise on the proposal that an announcement should be made at midnight that night (Snd/6rd September)that our Ambassador&apos; was to see Herr von Ribbentrop at8.0 a.m.  the next morning.    The Chiefs of Staff had advised that an announcement to this effect would make clear the purpose of the visit, and would give the Germansplenty of.time to anticipate our decision to declare war.It   was therefore to be deprecated.    The Chiefs of staff had indicated that they would like our Ambassador to seeHerr von Ribbentrop at, say, 2.0 a.m. , with an ultimatum to expire at,  say, 6.0 a.m.    Against this it must be pointed out that the long interval between the times atwhich we and the French took action would have a badpolitical effect.The Prime Minister said that, this being theposition, he had thought it right that the cabinet should meet and decide on the difficult situation whichhad arisen.

THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said that the Chiefs of Staff were afraid that any statement made to the Press at or about midnight(2nd/3rd September) would become known in Germany, withthe result that during the whole of the time between this announcement and the expiry of the ultimatum we should be liable to surprise attack by Germany.    They therefore thought that the right course was to shorten the time between any announcement which had to be made and thetime at which Sir Nevile Henderson would act.    In their view the essential point was to shorten the period of uncertainty between the delivery of the ultimatum and itsexpiry.    Subject to this, there was no vital differencefrom the point of view of the Chiefs of Staff betweenaction taken by Sir Nevile Henderson at 9.0 a.m.  or attwelve noon on Sunday, 3rd September.    It was important that advance information as to our intentions should not leak,out to the German Government before Sir Nevile Hendersondelivered the ultimatum.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in view of theadvice that had been given, he thought the right course was that no information should be given out on the wireless that night, but that a note might be allowed to appear in the stop-press columns of the Sunday morningpapers to the effect that the Prime Minister wouldhe in a position at twelve noon on Sunday to give the answer

which * speaking on evening of 2nd. September, he had said that he anticipated he would be able to give on 3rd September.He thought that when the statement \as made it would bevital to be in a position to tell the House of Commons thatthe ultimatum had expiredo     He therefore suggested that SirNevil.e   Henderson should be instructed to see Herr von ribbentrop at 9.0 aoiiio on the 3rd September, and to say that unless a reply was received by twelve noon a state of war would exist between England and Germany as from that hour.The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues thatit was still the French proposal to deliver an ultimatum attwelve noon on the 3rd September, expiring at 8 or 9 p.m.It was just possible that when the French Government becameaware of our decision, they might bring forward their timesa little, but he doubted whether they would do so.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat he was satisfied&apos;that action in this sense would satisfy the House of Commons.     He asked, however, as to its effecton the Polish Government, and inquired what communicationhad been made to the Polish Ambassador.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had seen thePolish Ambassador three times on Saturday 2nd September.The Polish Ambassador had  , been prefectly satisfied with ourposition, but had been very anxious and dissatisfied with the French position.  - A good deal

of lobbying had been going on, and the Polish ambassador had that evening asked him the direct question whether,ifthere&apos; was any difference of opinion between us and theFrench as to the date of delivery of an ultimatum,we wouldbe prepared to give an example to the French or whether we were only prepared to act in conjunction with them.      TheForeign Secretary had replied that wo should not fool ourselvesdebarred from acting before the French.      He added thatthe Polish Ambassador had said a good deal about the moral effect on the Pbles of delay on our part, and about theirexpectation that our intervention would lead to somediminution in the intensity of the German air attacks on poland.THE PRIME MINISTER then read out the latest telegramsummarising the position as to German attacks on Poland, whichwas to the effect that heavy attacks were being sustained.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat from the point of view of1 co-operation with the French,-the Chiefs of Staff viewed with some concern the proposal that we should act very much earlier than the French, andwere therefore disposed to agree that the ultimatumshould be delivered at 9.0 a.m., since action at thishour would be nearer to the hour at which the French would act6 -

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought thaton balance it was essential that the Prime Minister shouldhe able,when he mot the House at IS noon on Sunday, 3rdSeptembers to state the result of the delivery ofthe ultimatum.   On a technical point, while he thought thatG a.m. was a suitable hour for the interview, he doubted whether 12 noon was a suitable hour for the expiry ofthe ultimatum, since this might well leave the Prime minister in doubt as to the position up to, or at the very moment when he rose to speak.    He therefore suggested that the ultimatum should expire at 11 a.m.     He did not feel that,even for the sake of synchronisation with the French, weshould postpone our action any longer, since it was essential that the Prime Minister should be able to showthat definite &apos;action had been taken.General.agreement was expressed with this view.the SECRETARY OF STATE POR THE COLONIES said that on balance he was inclined to agree with the proposed time-table.But there was a contrary consideration which should have somethought.      There was great need for action which would bringthe nation together again.     He feared that, if no definite newscould be given to the Press, in time to appear in the papers on Sunday morning, the effect in prolonging doubt and suspicion of the Government would be unfortunate.     Prom that point ofview there was something to be said for getting into a positionin which the morning papers could say that Sir Nevile Hendersonhad been instructed to seek an interview at, say 3 o&apos;clock on sunday morning to present a warning to the Government whichexpired at, say, 6 o*clock a.m.- 7 -

TEE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said^that he shared the Colonial Secretaxs^^^iews, andwas afraid that the trouble might spread outside the.\Sunday press.THE SECRETARY CP STATE POR AIR pointed outthat the position would he restored ho;&apos; tne middleof the day?.;      THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR VAR suggested thatthe ultimatum might he delivered at 2 a.m., to expireat 6 a.m.    If this was done, the nev/s would overtake&apos; t ,!;:!:&quot;&apos;-:-.the &apos;news of the proceedings in Parliament on Saturdayafternoon.THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR FOREIGN affairs pointed out that this time-table would put us a very long way ahead of the French.    He thought it would bebetter to follow the time-table on which there hadalready been general agreement, by which Sir nevile henderson would see the German Foreign Minister at   and the ultimatum would expire at 11.    In that event,the Prime Minister, when speaking in tne House ofCommons, would be able to minimise the differences between the time at which we and the Frenchvsere taking action, and to say that at the very moment when hewas speaking the French Ambassador was making asimilar communication to the German Government.Our action and that of the French would appear to be almost a single act,   as to people being disheartenedbetween 9 and 11 on Sunday morning that might well- bethe case, but this would have to be endured.    Inany case the position would be restored when parliament met at 12 noon.   He thought that consideration might be^given to a statement being issued, which could

mzbe included in the stop press news in the Sundaypapers that Sir Nevile Henderson would meet Herrvon Ribbentrop at 9 a0m. , and that the PrimeMinister would make a statement in the House at noon.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCKY OP LANCASTERagreed with the time-table proposed, and thoughtthat the situation would be instantaneouslyrestored, by the statement which the prime minister would make in Parliament at noon on Sunday.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it wasnecessary in this matter to pay considerableregard to the French, who after all would bear the main part of the burden.     He thought that weshould regret it if we started a war with toov/ide a difference in the time of declaration of war.The discussion then turned again to thequestion whether anything should be included inthe stop press news, to the effect that Sir nevile henderson was having an interview with Herr von ribbentrop in the morning.      V/ould the Germanssuspect what such an announcement meant?THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thoughtthat the announcement,  to be of any value, wouldhave to say what the visit was about;    that,however, would bring about the result which theChiefs of Staff wished to avoid.      He thoughtthat It was necessary to face the fact that the sunday morning papers would give the Government abad press but their come-back would be all the stronger and would have an element of surprise.This view met with general approval.

THE PRIMS MINISTER asked his colleagueswhether any of them dissented from the view that sir Nevile Henderson should he instructed to seek an interview with Herr von Ribbentrop at   a.m., and to deliver an ultimatum to expireat 11 a.m.      This view was unanimously approvedby the Cabinet, and it was agreed that the cabinets decision should be communicated tothe French Government.It was also agreed that the Secretary ofState for the Dominions should be authorised tosend a communication to the Dominion PrimeMinisters at about 9 a. m. on Sunday, 3rdSeptember, informing them that-an ultima torn wasto be delivered.THE CABINET agreed   -(1) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to instruct sir Nevile Henderson to seek an interview with Herr von Ribbentropat 9 a.m.  on Sunday,  3rd Septembers(2) That at this interview Sir nevile henderson should inform theGerman Government that, unless theywere prepared to inform H.M.Government by 11 a. m.  that they accepted the proposals in our.communication of 1st September,(namely would give satisfactory assurances that they fcad suspendedall aggressive action against Poland,and were prepared promptly towithdraw their forces from Polis&amp;nterritory), a state of war wouldexist between Great Britain andGermany as from that hour.

Richmond Terraee, S.W.I.,^   3rd September, 1939.Note.Subsequent to the Cabinet Meeting, whichterminated at about 12.15 a.m. on Sunday, 3rdSeptember, the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary informed M.  Corbin of the decision reached by the Cabinet, namely that Sir nevile henderson would see the German Foreign Ministerat 9 a,m. on 3rd September and would inform him that unless he accepted the proposals in ourNote a state of war would exist from that hour.
