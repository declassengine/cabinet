PENSIONS PORMEMBERS OPPARLIAMENT.(previous reference!Cabinet 58(38), Con- &apos;elusion     )^0.1.       THE PRIME MINISTER reminded hiscolleagues that a resolution   in favourof pensions for Members of Parliament   hadbeen carried in the House of Commons onthe 2nd February, 1939.    In view of this resolution, he felt bound to bring in aBill to provide statutory authority forthe proposed annual deduction of  12 from members&apos; salaries.    He proposed, therefore,to introduce the Bill and to speak in favour ofit himself.   He thought, however, that theBill should be left to the free vote ofthe House and that, as on a recent occasion,the right course would be for UnderSecretaries and VJiips to be as free asBack Benchers to decide how they wouldvote, but that members of the cabinet should not vote against the Bill, although they need not feel bound to vote in favour ofit.   He hoped to introduce the bill before the Summer Recess.The Cabinet, approved thisproposal.

2. THE PRIME MINISTER reminded .his colleagues that, until the end. of the Session, Fridays were now taken for Government business.     On theprevious Friday, on a Division on the Ministry ofLabour Vote, the Government majority had fallen to18.     He hoped that his colleagues would, so far aspossible, arrange in future to work in their roomsin the House of Commons rather -hah in their offices on Fridays, so th&quot;t they could attendDivisions at short notice.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

COMPANYDIRECTOR-SHIPS.Tenure by ministers ofthe Crown,(previous reference:War Cabinet106, Con-conclusion ion 3 *)3 - -^E-^PRTtrE-minister said that the rule on thissubject, which had been laid, down by Sir Henry CampbellBannerman in March, 1906, was in the following terms :-&quot;All directorships held hy Ministers mustbe resigned, except in the case of honorarydirectorships, directorships in connectionwith philanthropic undertakings, anddirectorships in private companies&quot;.As his colleagues were aware, a number ofParliamentary Questions had recently been addressed tohim by Mr, D..N. Pritt, K.C. ,M.P.,  on this matter andhe had. invited Mr Pritt to submit his views in theform of a memorandum.    This he had done.It was evident that the term &quot;private companies&quot;,which had no statutory significance in 1906 and was probably used to cover Companies dealing wholly or mainly with family interests, now covered a. verymuch wider field.The Prime Minister said that he had reached theconclusion that some change was called for in regard,to Directorships of private companies.   He proposedto send to his  colleagues a. copy of a draft statement which had been prepared, setting out the change whichhe proposed should be made in the rule in regardto such Directorships.   He asked thatany Minister who would be embarrassed ^y the rule would let him know.   He also invited his cabinet colleagues to bring the statement to the notice ofUndei Secretaries in their Departments.   He would himself bring the statement to the notice of anyMinisters not  covered, by these arrangements.^he Cabinet, took no*e of this statement.

THE INT&quot;5R-national situation.-Russia.(previous reference !Cabinet 34(39), Con-elusion 2.)4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that his colleagues would-have seen ^elegramsNos. 150, 151 and 152, of the 4th July, 1939, fromSir William Seeds.The first point raised by these telegrams wasthat the Soviet Government had refused to agree tothe Inclusion of Holland and Switzerland in the secret list.   The wheel had. thus come full circlefrom, the early days of the negotiations, when russia had pressed for full reciprocity.The Foreign Secretary said that it was a curiousinstance of Soviet Governmental methods thatM. Molotov had stated that the People&apos;s Representa-tives had authorised the giving of guarantees inrespect of five countries, plus, the Baltic States^If, at a later date, Poland and. murkey made pactsof mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, those two countries could be dropped out of the number of third-party States, and their names replaced, on the list by those o^ Holland and Switzerland,t In form, the omission of Switzerland and theNetherlands from the countries in the secret listwas open to great objection.    On the facts as theyexisted today, however, this  course was perhaps not open to quite so much objection as raight appear atfirst sight,   ^hus, it could, well be argued that itwas of the first importa.nce to make some arrangement Eastern Europe which would ensure Russian support for Poland., a.nd. that any failure to achieve thiswould, a.ct as an encoura.gem.ent to Herr Hitler.In the view of the Foreign Policy Committeean even more important issue had. been raised, bymelegram No. 151 from Moscow, which defined &quot;indirect aggression&quot; as  &quot;an internal coup d&apos;et.ftt or a reversal

of policy in the interests of the aggressor&quot;.    It was unnecessary to stress the objections to this defini-tion and the difficulties which vjouI^ ensue therefrorr.The Foreign Policy Committee had been impressec&quot;by the need for urgent action and with the likelihood of further argument if new points were continuallyraised.   Th^jp had. therefore reached the conclusionthat the right course was that we should, submit tothe Soviet Government two definite alt ernatives, and.invite them to select one or the other.The first alternative was that the SovietGovernment should drop their definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot;, and. that we should, abandon our insist-ence on the inclusion of Switzerland, and Holland inthe secret protocol. Ne should, however, endeavourto incorporate in the Treaty a. provision for consulta-tion in the event of aggression against any Powersnot included, in the secret list, and we should alsoinclud.e a. provision for consultation to deal with cases of indirect aggression.mhe second, alternative was to fall ba.ck on a tripartite pact, together with provisions for consultation in regard to cases not cohered by sucha pact,If the second alternative was adopted, we shouldalso agree to further negotiations with a view to ex-tending the pact to other cases not covered by it.The Foreign Secretary said that he had. beenauthorise^ by the Foreign Policy Committee to prepare a draft telegram on these lines and to despatch it toMos cow as soon as it had been approved by the PrimeMinister and settle^ in consultation with the FrenchGovernment.

In the course of discussion, it was pointedout that it would appear that the exclusion of holland and Switzerland from the secret list of countries would    jenable Germany to avoid Russia being immediately involvedin a war which Germany started, by an attack on holland or Switzerland.      On the other hand, it was pointedout that if the list was kept secret, there would bean element of uncertainty in Herr hitler calculations.Again, it was felt, that it would be better that weshould reach an immediate agreement with Russia ratherthan allow the negotiations to drag on indefinitely.In reply to questions, the FOREIGN secretary said that he had very little information as to the realattitude of Russia in regard to the Treaty other thanthat which reached him in the Foreign Office telegrams.He did not anticipate that the result of the despatchof a telegram on the lines proposed would be that russia would break off negotiations altogether.      Ifthis happened, it would, he thought,  show that russia had never seriously intended to conclude a treaty with us.The Cabinet then considered the Sovietinsistence on the treaty covering cases of indirect aggression and on the proposed definition of suchaggression.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH asked what action we proposed to take if the new technique v/ere applied tothe Baltic States.      In his view, this point was- acrucial one in any arrangements to meet aggression.He asked how wide was the gap between the Britishand Soviet points of view on this matter.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that if anattempt was made to apply the new technique of indirect aggression to one of the Baltic countries, under theAnglo-French draft we should consult with Russia andif agreement so to do was reached, we should put the mechanism of mutual assistance into operation..     Underthe Russian draft, however, if Finland, for instance,signed a treaty with Germany which, in Russia&apos;s view,was unduly favourable to Germany, and if Russia tookaction in Finland which Germany regarded as Russianinterference, we might well find ourselves involved inwar.The view was generally expressed that the definition of indirect aggression proposed by theRussian Government was entirely unacceptable.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY added that in his view the methods by which the modern technique of indirect aggression could be applied were so various that it couldnot be satisfactorily covered by any single formula.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought there was acertain amount of suspicion between thetwo sides and, in particular, he thought that theRussians suspected that when we referred to &quot;consultations&quot;in the draft treaty, we intended to employ delayingtactics.After some further discussion, it was agreedthat there was no reason why the draft treaty should not provide for immediate consultation in regard to casesof indirect aggression although objection was seen toa rigid provision for consultation within, say, 3 or4 days.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that,in his view, the situation would be adequatels&apos;- met by a

simple Three-Power Pact..     Ke thought that theadditional provisions in the draft now under discussion were likely to involve us in all sorts of difficulties,more especially since he did not believe that the secretprotocol would be kept secret.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and several other members of the Foreign Policy Committee would inmany ways have preferred the conclusion of a simpleThree-Power Pact.     The conclusion reached had, however,been that if, after lengthy negotiations to obtain atreaty on a wider basis, we were now to send a telegram to the effect that we were only prepared to sign atreaty on the basis of a simple Three-Power Pact, weshould run the risk of putting ourselves in the wrongwith Russia.     It had therefore been thought better tosend a telegram putting forward two   alternatives.The Cabinet took note of the above statement and authorised the despatch to Moscow of atelegram on the lines approved by the ForeignPolicy Committee as indicated by the foreign secretary.

international situation (Cont*&amp;.)Danzig...and-Poland.(Previous Refer-ence:   Cabinet32(39) Conclu-sion 8),5. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that the Cabinet would be aware of the crop of rumours which had been current over the weekend to the effect that a coup at Danzigwas imminent.    It had been learned that anumber of these rumours were being freely-propagated by Herr Abbetz from Paris.   On1st July the French Government had wished usto join with them in issuing a formal government statement:    having regard, however, to thefact that these rumours were being propagated,toy an emissary of the German Government, theForeign Secretary had thought that the issueof such a statement might be playing theGerman game.    It had therefore been decidedto adopt a middle course.     No formalGovernment statement had been issued, but the newspapers had been given a certain amount ofinspired direction.The Foreign Secretary said that we hadnot yet had a firm reply to our telegram to Warsaw (No. 207), in which we had suggested that the moment had come when con-sultation should take place between the British,French and Polish Governments in order that the plans of the three Governments should become-ordinated in time.    Sir Howard Kennard had,said that Colonel Beck would find it difficultto be more specific as to the action he wouldtake in the event of an attempted coup at Danzig. IColonel Beck had always said that his action would be proportionate to the provocation ofjtHJWs&amp;j

At the same time if matters developed rapidly atDanzig it ivould he necessary for Poland to act quickly,unless she was to he at a serious military disadvantage.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that itv/as proposed to send a senior British General to poland to ascertain the Polish plans.      It had originally &quot;been proposed that both a French and a British General should go to Warsaw, but as there was already a French general there, this part of the plan was unnecessary.The Foreign Secretary added that he also intendedto seek an early interview with the German ambassador in London and to speak to him in much the same terms in regard to Danzig as Li. Bonnet had used to the german ambassador in Paris.The Foreign Secretary then said that the PrimeMinister had discussed with him the possibility ofF.R3j[3^)u^. making some communication to Signor Mussolini, giving him a plain intimation of the issues involved and of theconsequences if war ensued.     It was proposed to arrangefor a message, in suitable terms, to be conveyed from thePrime Minister to Signor Mussolini through our ambassador in RomeoThe Foreign Secretary said that he had also considered giving the Pope the outlines of a possible solution of the Danzig problem, but he had reached theconclusion that in the present atmosphere there was no opportunity for a settlement by negotiation.     The first point was to secure a detente.

8 2The Foreign Secretary invited the attention ofhis colleagues to Sir Neville Henderson&apos;s Telegram(No. 295 from Berlin) in which he reported that thePolish Ambassador had re-acted very quickly to thesuggestion that if anything was to he done it wasnecessary to deal direct with Herr Hitler.      This seemedto confirm Herr von Weizsacker&apos;s statement that there wez*esome indications that the Poles might be prepared tonegotiate on Danzig.The Foreign Secretary concluded by saying thatit was proposed to arrange for a clear statement to bemade in Parliament explaining the importance of Danzigand the main facts in regard to its position.    Sucha statement would have value in educating public opinion,both here and in the United States.     The statement would explain how serious would be the consequences ofan attempted coup and would indicate that in calmertimes negotiations might prove successful.     A draftof the statement had been sent to Colonel Beck.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that theBritish General to be sent to Poland would, of course,endeavour to obtain information as to Polish plansfrom Marshal Smigly-Rydz.    He thought however that instructions should also be given to the General asto the direction which we wished Polish plans to take.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that the general should not discuss political issues.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the general should ascertain what would be the most which Polandcould do if force was used in Danzig.

THE HOME SECRETARY stressed the importance ofgiving the General precise instructions* He suggestedthat the British General&apos;s discussions should coverPolish munitions and mobilisation.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE explainedthat Staff Conversations had already been held with thePoles, and that the Report of our representatives was nowbeing examined by the Chiefs of Staff.     He gave theCabinet particulars of some of the main facts which had emerged in these conversations,     (Paper No. C,O.S* 927).THE PRIME MIN73TER thought it was important thatthe British General&apos;s discussions with Marshal Smigly-Rydzshould not cut across the Staff Conversations, but shouldbe confined to the issue of what action the Poles proposedto take if a situation should develop at Danzig in whichthey were not prepared to acquisceo      It was important,that the General should receive precise directions.THE CABINET:(i) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary toconfer&apos;with the Secretary of Statefor War in regard to the despatchof a British General to Poland, andin particular to settle with theMinister for Co-ordihation of defence and the Secretary of State for War theterms of the instructions governing the course of his conversations to begiven to the General selected for thisMissions

IUT3SNATI0NAL 6. THE PRIME MINISTER said that a good dealgI&apos;:TI -TION. ( Contd.)Q had already heen clone to eliminate the risk that herr Hitler   might not realise that we were in defence Preparedness.earnest ahout the position at Danzig.     Neverthe-Waval Measures.less, he was not disinclined to take furtherF.R..3jlp,cl)&apos;] - action to add to the impression already created.It had already been arranged that the Fleet should undertake combined exercises with the Royal AirForce in August0     He had discussed with theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence and the FirstLord of the Admiralty the proposal that a further statement should presently be made, indicating thatit was intended to extend the scope of these com-bined exercises.     The First Lord was working out a plan whereby the exercises should be supplemented by making available further ships, including aconsiderable number of cruisers and destroyers,which would :.oin the Fleet after the August bank holiday.     This would result&apos;in a larger demonstra-tion of force and would also be very valuable if aserious crisis developed in August or September.These further ships could not be manned withoutcalling out reservists,     The scheme had not yetbeen finally completed.     He thoiight that anannouncement would not be necessary for some ten days.     Nevertheless, he would be glad if theCabinet would authorise the making of anannouncement in suitable terms if the situationrendered this course desirable before the nextweekly meeting of the cabinet

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said thatin the course of the next few days he proposedto announce that several squadrons were shortlyflying to Prance on a visit, and that a numberof flights over French territory would take place    jiiduring the next few weeks.Discussion turned to the question whetheraction or statements which tended to emphasise the critical   position in international affairsplayed into Germany&apos;s hands by fostering an atmosphere of constant tension.     The suggestion was also made that mobilisation of the Fleet wasa measure which it might be desirable to keep untilmatters were extremely seriously-S,,.It was agreed that this point of view was      jfione of great importance, and that it was necessaryto keep a balance between action which showedresolution, and action which might indicate that we were becoming apprehensive.     It waspointed out,however, that according to the plan described bythe Prime Minister, the announcement would be made some weeks before the event to which it related.Further, while the plan involved the calling-up&quot;of a certain number of reservists it fell very far short of mobilisation..The Cabinet approved in principle   the jjmaking of an announcement on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister, and agreed that if the situation shouldnecessitate an announcement on theselines, it might be made without further,reference to the Cabinet.

TS^5 inter--NATTONALf Confd.)^he position at Tientsin.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(39), Con-plus ion 1.)7. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had very little to say on this matter.There was a report in the Press, which he was not atpresent able to confirm, to the effect that thenegotiations at Tokyo would start on the ensuingday.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

8.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRin. reply to a question, said that he had little to add to the telegrams which had been received on thissubject.     He referred to a recent telegram fromSir Ronald Lindsay (Telegram No. 295 from Washington)which indicated that the Administration intended tocarry on the fight in the Senate, but that theprospects were not very encouraging as it had always been expected that the Senate would be less favourable than the House of Representatives.j1

EXPORT CREDITGUARANTEE SCHEME.Effect of theInternationalSituation.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(39), conclusion).9. THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat at the present time a good many credits con-tinued to be given in respect of exports toGermany and Italy, on the advice of the export guarantees Advisory Council.     The Council, however,was now somewhat apprehensive as to the   positionand he thought that, failing some guidance, theymight refuse to renew guarantees in respect of exports to Germany and Italy.     His view was thatit would be a pity if exports to Germany and Italyunder the Government scheme were to be brought toan end at the present time.     At the same time,the Government should not put pressure on theAdvisory Council to grant such credits against theirown judgment.     If the Cabinet agreed, he wouldlike authority to communicate &quot;with the AdvisoryCouncil on the lines indicated.     The result wouldXjrobably be that the Council would continue togrant credits in respect of exports to Germanyand Italy.General agreement was expressed with thissuggestion, and the President of the Boardof Trade was authorised to act accordingly.

(previous reference:Cabinet 1(39) Con-clusion 10).I.R.A. OUTRAGES,   10.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.-147 (39)) in which he urged the need for further powers to deal with the criminalconspiracy of the Irish Republican Army.     In his memorandum the Home Secretary described the organisationof the I.R.A. and reviewed the salient features of thelong campaign of outrages which had begun on the16th January with the object of forcing His Ma^estyfsGovernment to bring the partition of Ireland to anend.     These showed on the one hand the serious extentof the danger to life and property and on the otherhand the difficulties which prevented the effectivesuppression of the organisation without further drasticpowers.The most effective new weapon would be thepower to intern persons whom the Home   Secretary hadreasonable grounds for supposing to be engaged in the conspiracy, with a provision for some form of appealto an Advisory Committee,     There would probablybe Parliamentary objection, however, to the grant ofsuch a power in time of peace, involving, as it would,a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act.An alternative weapon would be the power to deport and exclude persons believed to be concerned Inthe conspiracy, with liability to a substantial termof imprisonment if an attempt were made to return tothis country.     Such a power would assist in thesolution of the real problem, which was to disorganisethe local control maintained by sectional organisers.

The existence of a power to deport might prove a powerful deterrent to any sympathisers who might hetempted to participate in the organisation.     Such a power, moreover, would he likely to command general support if its use were confined to the case ofpersons who were believed to have been resident inIreland and not to have been established more than &quot;X&quot;years in Great Britain, though it might be desirable,to avoid the appearance of discrimination against Eire,to make the power to remove applicable to all Britishsubjects not born in of established in Great britain for more than &quot;X&quot; years.     To fix &quot;X&quot; at four or fiveyears would cover a fair proportion of the principalorganisers, but the higher the figure, the more adequate it would be for Police purposes.     Provisionfor the constitution of an Advisory Committee to adviseIn individual cases might be made if it were consideredthat this would make the passage of a Bill through parliament easier.     The Home Secretary was convinced,however, that nothing short of internment or removalwas likely to be of any use to deal with a highlyorganised Secret Society which incited or ruthlesslyenforced fanatical obedience.,There was no doubt that the organisation was greatly feared by the Eire Government which had been obliged, in its own defence, to pass the offences against the State Act, under which it had proclaimedthe I.H*A. organisation to be illegal.     But whether that Government intended, or had the power, to arrestthe principal leaders remained to be seen.,   Mr. de valera had made it plain that he was not seeking powers

&quot;because of events outside Eire, and it might thereforebe that, so long as the organisation confined itselfto committing outrages in the United Kingdom, he did not propose to take any further practical steps beyond thepresent declaration of illegality*     In any event, any active steps of suppression in Eire might only compel theleaders to cross over to this country and intensifytheir present campaign,.The Memorandum continued that if the Cabinet wereprepared to agree to the principle of a Bill to conferpowers of deportation and exclusion, there remained thequestion whether such powers should relate only to Eire,or should include also Northern Ireland.     On this matter the Home Secretary proposed to consult with the Governmentof Northern Ireland.In conclusion, the Home Secretary asked for authority to prepare and submit to the Committee of HomeAffairs a Bill (not necessarily for immediate introduction)providing for the removal and exclusion of personsbelonging to the I.R.A., on the lines suggested in theMemorandum in order that a Bill might be ready, if therewere any new developments which called for additional powers *

THE HOME SECRETARY said that thesituation had become more serious in the last fewweeks.    At the outset the police had beenvery successful in combating these outrages, butthey were now.finding it very much harder to obtainthe evidence necessary to secure convictions.   Afterthe Piccadilly outrages the police had arresteda dozen men whom they felt sure were guiltypersons.    They had not, however, been able to securethe necessary evidence, and after two or three days they had had to let the men go.The Homo Secretary thought that it was essential that effective action should be taken assoon as possible and without waiting until furtheroutrages took place*    In his view, the onlyreally effective action would be to take emergency powers which would enable suspected persons to beinternedc    If his colleagues did not feel able toaccept this suggestion there remained thealternative of deportation.It might be argued that, failing some visasystem, there would be no means of checkingdeportees trying to return through the ports of entry from Ireland.    It was true that the absenceof any visa system created a gap, but he was satisfied that if the power of deportation was limited to citizens of Eire who had been resident in this country for less than five years, it-wouldenable the authorities to deport anything up to 100suspected persons who were strongly suspected ofbeing concerned in these outrages.    He had now reached the conclusion that it was necessary tointroduce legislation before the end of the  Session.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he hopedthat every other expedient would he explored beforethe policy of internment was decided upon.   Apartfrom the difficulty of commending such a policy to public opinion, an internment policy was, in his view, only suited to a temporary situation to whichit was hoped other measures of alleviation could beapplied.   He preferred the policy of expulsion, which,however, he thought would have to be accompanied by thepower to imprison prior to expulsion.   He thought thatit would be necessary to have some tribunal withadvisory powers whose recommendations would, in fact,be accepted.    In Bengal there had been an advisorytribunal of minor judges (not judges of High Courtstatus) whose reports had not been published.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he did not know what Mr.  de Valera&apos;sreactions would be to the action proposed.   Anofficial of the Dominions Office, who had recentlyvisited Dublin, reported that Mr. Walshe was apprehensive about the position and that there was now some possibility of co-operation between theBritish and Eire Authorities as regards personsproceeding from Eire to this country.   Mr. de valera had expressed much concern about the matter, buthitherto he had not been helpful in co-operating with us.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that the Eire Government had themselves passed a very drastic law which provided, inter alia, that powers of internment could be brought into operation by the issue of a proclamation by that Government.

He thought that at the appropriate stage., it wouldhe necessary to tell Mr. de Valera what action we proposed to take although he did not suggest that weshould consult with him in the matcer.THE PRIME minister .-R said that he was very anxious in regard to the situation.     It was only bya miracle that a serious loss of life had not occurred in the Piccadilly outrage.     He favoured, and he thoughtthat the Cabinet as a whole would favour, immediate legislation to deal with the situation,THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR SCOTLAND supported this point of view.     Though the. e had been no outragesamong the Irish population in the Glasgow neighbourhood,the police authorities in Glasgow favoured further powers.THE LORD PRIVY S .;AL referred to the Art 0JBriencase and pointed out what deportation, like internment,involved interference with the Habeas Corpus Act.The Cabinet agreed:(l) To authorise the Home Secretary toaraange for the immediate drafting ofa Bill, and for its submission to theHome Affairs Committee without further reference to the Cabinet:(2) The Bill shmld make provision for the arrest, deportation and exclusion fromthis country of persons belonging tothe Irish Republican Army:(3) That a communication should be made toMr. de Valera when the Bill is drafted in order that he should be given the chance of making his comments, but not of holding up the Bill:4(4) That the proposed Bill should beintroduced and passed into law before the recess.-,

2x.      The.Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(CP.-145 (39)) on the subject of War Risks insurance of Essential Commodities.   The Memorandum stated thatthe Board of Trade, in consultation with theInsurance interests, had now worked out a scheme onthe lines indicated by the Chancellor of theExchequer in his statement in the House of commons on the 31st January, namely, a scheme for theinsurance in war-time of all goods which, in theopinion of the Board of Trade, were essential tothe life of the community during war, including themaintenance of the export trade, and under which therewas no provision in peace but it was necessary forthe persons concerned to register at a nominal feesufficient to cover expenses.The President sought authority to submit aBill on this subject to the Committee of Eome Affairs,with a view &quot;to its introduction in Parliament forth-with.    In addition to the provisions relating tothe insurance of commodities, the proposed Bill would include the provisions required to enable theBoard of Trade tp operate the comprehensive schemefor marine war insurance, two parts of which had.already been put into operation, in advance oflegislation, with the approval of the Cabinet atthe Meetings mentioned in the margin.    It would also include the power to put into operation a scheme tocover goods in transit between ship and warehouse.After outlining the effect of the provisions relating to commodities, the President indicatedcertain important points of detail on which he ____considered that the scheme announced by the

Chancellor should be modified:-(i) that the scheme should be wide enough tocover practically all goods in trade,without attempting to distinguish betweencommodities considered to be essential for the community in war-time or those whichwere not;(ii) that the idea of compulsory insurance should be dropped;    with the corollarythat no trader who failed to takeadvantage of a voluntary scheme (coupled with a minimum premium based on the costof insuring, say,  100 worth of goods)would be entitled to receive ex gratiacompensation for the destruction of hisstock by enemy action under thecompensation scheme except to an amount which could be limited to  100;(iii) that in regard to the increased fee forlate registration, contemplated in theChancellor&apos;s statement, nothing but asum equivalent to an exceedingly heavyinsurance premium could act as an incentive to register in time of peace soas to be covered in time of war, and thatthe idea underlying the proposal was: sufficiently met by the fact that a traderwho had not registered in time of peace,would find himself without cover until apolicy could be issued to him.

THE PRESIDENT OP TEE BO,VRD OP TRADE drew attention to the three points in regard to which he proposed that the scheme announced by the chancellor ofthe Exchequer should be modified.     The third pointhad now been settled with the Treasury.     The main question at issue was whether the scheme should be on a compulsory or a voluntary basis.The President said that he agreed that ontheoretical grounds the arguments in favour of a compulsory scheme set out in the Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. 17 (39)) wereunanswerable.     In practice, however, a number of difficulties arose.     In the first place, the Chancellor1scheme had not provided for the inclusion of retailers.It had been urged in the Cabinet discussion thatretailers should be included.     In practice, however, itwas impossible to have a compulsory scheme which appliedto all retailers.      The Insurance Companies stated quitedefinitely that they could not work such a scheme.      Inhis view a compulsory scheme from which retailers were excluded was not desirable since such an exclusionwas not equitable and would give rise to difficultiesof definition.This line of argument led to the view that a compulsory scheme could only be proceeded with ifbusinesses were included in it by reference to some financial limit.     He thought that a provision on theselines would present a serious obstacle to the passageof the Bill at the present time.There was also the consideration that theauthorities of the House of Commons would regard a Billproviding for compulsory insurance as a taxation measure.The Bill would therefore have to be founded on a Ways and

Means Resolution, and would be tantamount to imposingtaxation without stating what the rate of- tax would be.This also presented serious difficulties.A further point was that, owing to fluctuations in price values, a business might be liable to the compulsory scheme one day and cease, to be liable on thenext day.     Again, when it had been established that aparticular business was within the limits of compulsory insurance,it would be difficult to check that the business was Insured for the right amount.The President said that he had therefore reachedthe conclusion that a compulsory scheme of insurancewas not in fact practicable.     Nevertheless, he thoughtthat a large proportion of the substantial firms would infact take advantage of a voluntary scheme, since therewas a growing recognition that there were very few places in this country which were safe from air attack.     Hethought also that the banks and financial houses would show unwillingness to finance commodities, wherever situated,unless those commodities were covered by the Governmentinsurance scheme.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that, while he appreciated the serious difficulties involved, hethought that a big question of principle was at stake.His conception of the underlying principle of the schemewas that it was imperative to ensure the supply of essential commodities to the people of this country inwar, and that the right method of securing this end was thatthe community as a whole should bear the risks, rather thanthat the matter should be dealt with on the basis ofdiffering risks for each area according to its vulnerability.The scheme had been worked out in general outline by a departmental Committee,  which had reached the conclusion thatthe right course was to have a compulsory scheme of insurance for essential commodities.-27-

As he understood the matter^ thePresident of the Board of Trade now proposedto have a voluntary scheme of insurance, hutat a flat rate applicable to the whole country.The difficulties of a Government scheme &quot;basedon a flat rate were, he thought, evident.The scheme would be attractive to firms indangerous areas, but would not be attractive to those in safer areas.     He thought that underthe President&apos;s scheme, instead of a free move-merit of commodities in war there would be an increasing tendency for firms not to insure, butto send their goods to what they believed to  &quot;bethe safer areas.     He felt sure that before longany voluntary scheme would have to be amended by offering varying rates according tothe degreeof vulnerability,.More generally, the Chancellor of theExchequer thought that in a war such as was envisaged, it would be necessary to adopt some ofthe methods of the totalitarian regimes and this applied particularly to the matter now under dis-jcussion.     He thought that many of the practicaldifficulties to which the President of the Boardof Trade had referred applied as much to a volun-tary as to a compulsory scheme.In regard to the retailers, the Chancellorof the Exchequer agreed that it would not   bepossible to have a scheme which covered thesmaller retailers, but he thought that it wouldbe necessary to proceed on the basis of includingretailers above a specified financial limit inany compulsory scheme.

THE LORD PRIVY - SEAL said that he was disturbed at the proposed departure from a compulsory scheme.   Herather doubted whether, if a voluntary scheme were adopted, it would in fact cover the great majority of stocks as the President of the Board of Trade anticipated.He was afraid that there might be an inducement totraders to keep stocks unduly short in the vunerable areas.    This would not be in the public interest.   Hethought that it was difficult to justify a flat ratein regard to a voluntary scheme, but that a flat rate was justifiable in regard to a compulsory scheme ofgeneral application which was not really an insurancescheme so much as a scheme of mutual indemnity.    Theadoption of this principle would also be of importancein regard to fixed property.    He agreed that in regardto Air Raid Precautions it had been necessary to limitstatutory obligations to firms in the vulnerable areas.Such a limitation was a weakness in the scheme, but onewhich was inevitable on practical grounds.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-(l) To remit the outstanding questions as summarised on pages 24 and 25 of these minutes to a Cabinet committee composed as follows:-The Lord President of the Council (Chairman).The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Privy Seal.The Secretary of State for Scotland.The President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.The Minister of Transport.(2) That the President of the Board of trade should have authority to submit a Bill,based on the Report of the above Committee,direct to the Committee of Home Affairswithout further reference to the Cabinet.

12. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP--146 (39)) inwhich he drew attention to the desirability of instituting some general survey of the various plans and measures which had already been devised withthe object of maintaining the economic life of thecountry in time of war.    A number of suggestions onthis subject had been received from various quarters,including the Prime Minister&apos;s Panel of Industrial-ists.    The Chancellor had considered the possibilityof setting up a Committee to watch over the progressin these matters, but had reached the conclusion thatit would be preferable to select an individual withthe necessary knowledge and experience, and to ask him to undertake a review of the plans and proposalsprepared by various Departments, in order to determine whether they were consistent with one another andwhether they covered the ground.    A review of this- kind would give an opportunity not only to assure allconcerned that the work so far done was on the rightlines, but it would also provide a means of securing that decisions which might have to be arrived at tomeet our more immediate difficulties were both right in themselves and not calculated to run counter towhat might have to be done in the event of a waremergency.    Such a review, in addition to showing up any defects or gaps, would no doubt result inrecommendations in general terms as to the lines onwhich those defects and gaps could be dealt with.The Chancellor proposed to invite Lord Stampto undertake this task at once, assisted byone or two economists and perhaps a prominentindustrialist,  all of whom should be familiar with government Departments and with the machinery ofGovernment.   Lord Stamp would also have at his-30-

disposal the services of a suitable Civil Servant(with Treasury experience, if possible), and ofthe Cabinet Secretariat..     The Chancellor addedthat the President of the Board of Trade and theLord Privy Seal were aware of these proposals and had indicated their agreement with them.After a short discussion the cabinet approved this proposal.

EXPORT GUARANTEE(No. 2) BILL.(previous references:Cabinet 33 (39),Conclusion 8, and cabinet 34 (39),Conclusion 9.)13.       The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(H.A.-29 (39)), covering the draft Export Guarantees(No. 2) Bill, the objects of v/hich were (a) to make provision for an increase of the limit   of  10millions in respect of non-commercial guaranteesgiven under Section 4 of the Export Guarantees Act,1939j    (b) to enable the Treasury to arrange finance for promissory notes, etc., guaranteed by the Boardof Trade at times when those notes could not bemarketed on advantageous terms;     together with thefollowing recommendation thereon by the Committeeof Home Affairs (H.A.C. 15th Conclusions (39),Minute 1):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the export guarantees (N.o. 2) Bill in the form ofthe draft annexed to H.A.-29 (39),subject to the amendments agreed upon in the course of the discxission (includingthe substitution of the new short title&apos;0verseas Trade Guarantees bill), andsubject also to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable.&quot;In the course of discussion, the JORD CHANCELLORexplained that he entertained some doubts as to thewords in Clause 1 (i) of the Bill &quot;for the purposeof establishing or of encouraging trade or anybranch of trade&quot;.     He felt some doubt whether someof the transactions which it was now proposed tocarry out in order to assist our allies or potentialallies wore, strictly speaking, within the termsof these words.     He thought, however, that thesituation was not open to objection provided the.

authorities concerned took the view that,although the transactions contemplated might berisky, there was nevertheless a prospect of Jflqpscr-ment.     He agreed also that it was difficult tosee how the point could be raised,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thatthe words referred to were the words which appeared in the present Export Credits Guarantees Actand it would be difficult to adopt a differentphrase in the present Bill.The Cabinet approved therecommendation of the Committeeof Home Affairs as summarised above.
