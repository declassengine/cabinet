THE INTER-J NATIONALI SITUATION.(Danzig andGermany.Considerationof HerrHitler1 s replyto the british   Government1 sj communication of 28th August.f(previous reference:Cabinet 45 (39)Conclusion 2. )I.      THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the cabinet would have seen the terms of Kerr Hitler&apos;s replydated the 30th August (Telegram No. 499 from Berlin)to our communication i.f the 28th August..      Inregard to the sentence towards the end of the replyin which it was stated that the Germans counted onthe arrival of a Polish emissary with full powers inBerlin on Wednesday, the 30th August, the foreign secretary said that a telegram had been sent to berlin at 2.0 a.m. to say that we would give carefulconsideration to the reply of the German Governmenton Wednesday, but that we could not arrange for a polish representative to arrive in Berlin on that day (Telegram No. 285 to Berlin).A telegram had also been sent to Rome earlyin the morning to indicate that we had it in mind tosuggest a military standstill to the German Government.A telegram had also been sent to Warsawsaying that, while we could not take the responsibilityof advising the Polish Government not to carry outfull mobilisation, we hoped that their measures would receive as little publicity as possible (TelegramNo. 330 to Warsaw).The Foreign Secretary then referred to thefirst summary of Herr Hitler&apos;s reply which had beenreceived before the arrival of the full text..(Telegram No. 498 from Berlin).     He had discussed this summary with the Prime Minister about midnight on the previous night and had begun the preparation ofa draft reply to what he had felt was a most un-satisfactory document.     On returning to the ForeignOffice, however, he had found that the text of thefull reply from Kerr Hitler was in process of being received.      On studying the full text, he had f^elt

and still felt that the summary had been misleading.Although the full text was open to several inter-interpretations, nevertheless he thought that the line weshould take in regard to it was fairly clear.     It mightbe that Herr Hitler was playing for time, or that he washoping to manoeuvre us into breaking off negotiations.The terms of Herr Hitler8s reply were somewhat bombastic,but he thought that, when stripped of its verbiage, itrevealed a man who was trying to extricate himself froma difficult position.     Thus, Herr Hitler accepteddiscussion with the Polish Government, but said that thediscussion must start at once in Berlin.     Agaixa, he accepted our proposal in regard to an internationalguarantee, but subject to the consent of the U.S.S.R.He had also stated that the German Government have neverhad any intention of touching Poland&apos;s vital interests or questioning the existence of an independent PolishState.The Foreign Secretary then gave his colleaguescertain information received from a special source as tothe course of negotiations.     This information is recorded on the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Cabinet-Ar-Conclusions.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought thatthe general line which our reply should take should be topin Herr Hitler down to the points in his reply in whichhe had met our point of view, and on other points toendeavour to safeguard the position of ourselves and ofour allies.     He thought that the action required v/as(l) to send a reply as soon as possible to the GermanGovernment,  (2) to send a telegram to Warsaw, and (3) tocommunicate the text of our reply to the French andItalian Governments.     The suggestion had also been made that the Prime Minister should send a personal message to herr Hitler, /he  /Wv^*- 2 -

The Foreign Secretary said that reports hadbeen received from various sources of anti-Governmentdemonstrations up and down Germany^ It was difficult to assess the value of these reports buthe thought that everything pointed to the line whichwe took being at once firm yet unprovocative.Information was also given as to the latestposition of the German troops.      In one quarter it hadbeen suggested that Germany now had 60 Divisions on herEastern Frontier and there had been a rumour that russia had strengthened her garrisons on the Polishfrontier.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that information which he had received indicated thatGermany had 46 Divisions on her Eastern Frontier and15 on her Western Frontier.     It was agreed, however, thatthese military concentrations afforded no validargument against further negotiations with the GermanGovernment.In the course of discussion, reference wasmade to the demand for the return of Danzig to the reich,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that this had been an essential feature in allthe German demands.

In reply to a question &quot;by the Minister ofSupply,     he said that he did not know whether the&quot;return of Danzig&quot; meant the return of the Cityonly or whether It   included the surroundingterritory.     On this we should maintain our general position, namely, that the criterion was whetherPoland&apos;s vital interests were affected.Reference was also made to reports ofatrocities which had been received.     As usualit seemed impossible to find out what amount ofcredence should be attached to these reports,THE MINISTER  OP SUPPLY said that the night before he had listened in to the German wire-less.      This had consisted of a succession of reports, with great wealth of detail, of attacks on persons of German race in Poland.     The Polishwireless had cited several instances of Germanpatrols which had been encountered 5 kilometreson the Polish side of the frontier.On the general question as to the inter-pretation to be placed upon the German offer, thequestion was asked whether the demand that thePolish Emissary with full powers should be atonce despatched to Berlin should be taken as showing that Germany intended to impose on thePolish representative the same sort of treatment as had been accorded to Dr. Schusnigg   and Dr.Hacha,

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that whilethat had been his first impression it had not been confirmed by further study of the document.     Hethought it was significant that while Herr Hitler&apos;reply started with some rather violent statements,the latter half contained a formal declaration.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thoughtthat the reply was what one would expect to receive from a man who felt obliged to put up a show ofmaintaining his own position and yet, at the same time,felt constrained to accept the points put to him.While he agreed that at first sight the letter was unsatisfactory, it did in fact contain an acceptanceof our points, though in a grudging and not very satisfactory way.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the most unsatisfactory thing in Herr Hitler&apos;s reply was thedemand that the Polish Emissary should go to berlin to-day.     This definitely represented part of the oldtechnique.     It was essential that we should make it quite clear that we were not going to yield on thispoint.The Cabinet then turned to consideration ofthe terms of the draft reply to be sent to the GermanGovernment, and of a draft telegram to Warsaw.Copies of the drafts were handed round, at the Meeting.

Draft reply The following were the main points madeto theGerman in discussion of the draft reply to the GermanGovernment.Government:-Paragraph 4.    It was stated in this paragraphthat the German Government accepted in principle the condition that any settlement should be madethe subject of an international guarantee.    did the terms of the German communication on thispoint - &quot;the existence of the Polish State in theform in which it would then continue to exist couldbe adequately safeguarded in the economic andpolitical sphere by means of internationalguarantees&quot; - constitute a complete acceptanceof our proposals?   The words underlined wereperhaps the most sinister in the communication.It was suggested that this point shouldbe borne in mind in connection with the terms ofparagraph 4 of our reply.The venue for the meeting of Representativesof the German and Polish Governments.    considerable discussion took place on this point.THE SEORETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that the question of holding a meeting on someneutral ground had been mooted, but that no definiteenquiry had as yet been made on this point.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it mightnot be desirable to include in the reply to theGerman Government any specific reference to thevenue.    He thought a position might well arise in which the Polish Government would say thatthey were prepared to send a representative to meet

The words underlined wereperhaps the most sinister in the communication.It was suggested that this point shouldbe borne in mind in connection with the terms ofparagraph 4 of our reply.The venue for the meeting of Representativesof the German and Polish Governments.    considerable discussion took, place on this point.THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that the question of holding a meeting on someneutral ground had been mooted, but that no definiteenquiry had as yet been made on this point.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it mightnot be desirable to include in the reply to theGerman Government any specific reference to thevenue.    He thought a position might well arise in which the Polish Government would say thatthey were prepared to send a representative to meet

the representatives of the German Government, hutthat they would not send a representative to Berlin.At a later stage in the Meeting, several members of the Cabinet said that they attachedconsiderable importance to the venue being on neutralground, and they thought it was important that weshould communicate our views on this matter to thei -German Government.    It was suggested that this mightbe done through informal channels.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs read out a telegram which had just been received fromSir H. Kennard (Telegram Ho. 360from Warsaw), inwhich he emphasised the importance of the meetingtaking place in a neutral country, or in Italy.Representation of the Polish Government in negotiations with the German Government. Herr Hitler*reply spoke of the despatch to Berlin of a Polishemissary with full powers.    The view was expressed that it was very important that arrangements should he made for the Polish Government to be adequatelyrepresented.   A suggestion was first made that an addition to paragraph 7 of the draft might be madeto deal with this point.Later in the discussion it was suggestedthat it was for the Polish Government to say how they wished to be represented in the negotiations withGermany, and that we should put ourselves in theposition of standing behind the Polish Governmentand getting them to indicate their views as to their requirements as to representation (and also as tovenue).    This view met with general approval.THE PRIME MINISTER said, and the cabinet agreed, that the views expressed in regard torepresentation and venue would be carefully considered, with a view to suitable amendments beingmade, -to- the draft reply to the German Government.

Paragraph 8.      The Cabinet noted thesuggestion that no military movements should takeplace during the negotiations.      It was explainedthat the stand-still proposed in this paragraph wouldbe for an indefinite and not for a specified period,since the latter would give rise to a dangerous timewhen the specified period came to an end.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA asked whetherit would be possible to go further and to suggest thatforces on both sides should be withdrawn for a reasonabledistance behind the frontiers.In discussion THE PRIME MINISTER said that he deprecated this suggestion, because he felt sure thatit would be rejected and he did not wish to get intoa dispute with the German Government on points of this nature.It was agreed that the sentence in paragraph 8which made reference to somewhat analogous circumstances in September last should be omitted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs referred to the \7ords &quot;vital interests&quot; in paragraph 2and to the words &quot;Polish vital interests and independence&quot; in paragraph 5.     As a matter of drafting,he wondered whether paragraph 5 could not be workedinto paragraph 2.Draft Telegram The Cabinet then considered the draft to Warsaw.telegram to Warsaw.     It was suggested that reference might be made in this telegram to the venue for themeeting of the representatives of the German and PolishGovernments.i THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs explained that he proposed to send M. Beck a copy ofour reply to the German Government.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR SCOTLAND suggestedthat in order to save time it might he desirable tosend a tele gran dealing with the question of venuebefore the reply to the German Government was despatchedTHE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs undertook to consider this suggestion.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thoughtthat it would be wise to give the Polish Government a considerably clearer indie ation, than v/as contained inthe draft telegram, of our sense of disapproval at the tone and substance of the German telegram if takenau pied de la lettre.     It should also be explained to the Polish Government that our policy was to piathe Germans down to the good points in their answerand to work for improvements on the points -which v/eireless satisfactory.     It v/as agreed that suitableamendments should be made on these lines.It was agreed that the conclusion ofparagraph 2 of this telegram should be modified inthe sense of indicating that the essential pointin the German reply was that the German Governmentwere prepared to negotiate.Paragraph h.     It v/as agreed that the words&quot;will see their way to do so immediately&quot; should be modified.The Cabinet approved the general linesof the draft telegrams to Berlin andWarsaw, and authorised the despatchof the telegrams, subject to thenecessary amendments being made onthe lines agreed in the discussion.

THE INTER-national situation(CONT*D.)Turkey.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(39), Con-clusion 4.2.      . THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR askedwhether the position in regard to Turkey could nowbe regarded as satisfactory, or whether there was any cause for anxiety.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he thought that the situation could nowbe regarded as satisfactory.The Cabinet took note of this statement.

THE INTER-national situation(CONT&apos;D. )The far east.(previous reference;Cabinet 41(39), Con-clusion 4. )3. THE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR AIR askedwhether the position in the Ear East was any clearer.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he had no definite information.    He had,however, had some discussion with the japanese ambassador, who had informed him that he might become the Foreign Secretary in the new JapaneseCabinet, and added that, if he were offered thatpost, he would wish to discuss the position with theForeign Secretary before reaching a decision.The Cabinet took note of this statement.- 11 -

PENCE 4.    THE PRIME&apos; MINISTER reminded his colleagues.      JASURES.thatj in the Debate in the House of Commons on thevacuation.previous day,, Mr. Greenwood had pressed that thepreviousReference: evacuation of children should take place at once.Cabinet 48 (*9)Conclusion 2* ) The Prime Minister thought that the moving spiritbehind this proposal was Mr. Herbert Morrison,  andthat Mr. Greenwood had perhaps spoken rather more strongly in favour of it than he had intended.    later in the evening of the previous day he had received aDeputation from the National Council of Labour, con-sisting of Sir Walter Citrine9 Mr. Herbert Morrison and mrs. Barbara Gould.    It was noticeable that Mr. herbert morrison had pressed the point far more strongly thanthe other two.The Prime Minister said that he had repliedsympathetically, but had pointed out the serious disadvantages of carrying out evacuation at this moment.   V/hile it wa3 easy to send the children away,it was by no means so easy to decide when they should return.    Again, people would put up with things in war which they would not tolerate in peace.   While he wasnot afraid of the effect on public opinion in thiscountry or elsewhere if a decision was announced tocarry out evacuation, he thought it would make it moredifficult to resist pressure  to allow business firms to leave London.       He had indicated that, in his view,the risks of air bombardment were not perhaps quite soImminent as the members of the Deputation thought.     There!;,was reason to think that Hcrr Hitler would not startoperations against us, but would wait for us to attack him. .,He thought that he had convinced Sir Walter Citrineand had half convinced Mrs. Gould, but had made little or no effect upon Mr. Herbert Morrison.   He had, however,  ,!said that the whole matter would be kept under careful review, and that the position might be affected by herr Hitier&quot;s reply.

The Prime Minister said that the French Governmenthad now started the evacuation of children, and he was disposed to think that there was a prima facie case for review of the decision not to start evacuation.     Ifsuch a decision was reached, however, it would be necessaryto exercise great care in the Press announcements made,and not in any way to relate the decision to Herr Hitler&apos;reply.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that if the order tocarry out evacuation was not given almost immediately,evacuation could not start until Friday.     The processwould take three days, and would,  indeed, spread into thefourth day.     Unless immediate orders were given, the scheme could not, therefore, be completed until Monday.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat it seemed to be assumed that we should have acertain amount of time to complete our Defence preparations,after an invasion of Poland by Germany.      It would clearlytoe necessary that we should concert with the French asto the time at which we should declare war on germany in this event.   To the extent to which the Frenchpreparations were in advance of our own, they would presumably be less disposed than we should be to delayissuing an ultimatum.THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR AIR said that he understood the Chiefs of Staff had considered this matter on the previous &apos;7.ayy and had decided for the present to makeBO recommendation for the immediate evacuation of children.THE HOME SECRETARY thought that it would beimpossible to delay the issue of an ultimatum if poland was invaded.In the course of discussion the view was expressed a

that it would he better to wait a day, and see whether asatisfactory reply was received in regard to the venuefor the meeting between representatives of the Polish and German Governments.,      It would be a grave responsibility to order evacuation immediately.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he would prefer to wait another day.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR tad THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR THE COLONIES expressed agreement with this view.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT pointed out that unless a decision was given by 2 p.m0 on any day. evacuationcould not from the point of view of transports becarried out on the ensuing day.After further discussion5 the Cabinet agreed -(l) Not to issue orders forthwith to set in motion the Government evacuation schemefor the civil population:(2) That the question of issuing orders to setthis scheme in motion should be kept under continuous review in the light of theinternational situation:(3) To authorise the Prime Minister to givethe necessary directions to set theevacuation scheme in motion in consultationwith the Ministers concerned5 when he considered that this was necessary.- 14 -

ARMY RECRUITMENT     5. The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumGS MOBILISATION.by the Secretary of State for War (CP.  I8h (39))on the subject of Recruiting for the Array on mobilisation, in which it was pointed out that,in view of the man power available in the RegularArmy, including Reservists and SupplementaryReservists,and in the Territorial Army, there wouldbe no need for large numbers of recruits at theoutbreak of war, except for certain tradesmen, andthat the Militia would be available for immediatereinforcements.The recruitment of a large number of volunteers, therefore, which was contemplated under existing plans,would be likely to cause considerableembarrassment and the Secretary of State for War,therefore, proposed that, except for special classesof tradesmen and semi-skilled labour to meetdeficiencies on the outbreak of war of a kind whichthe Militia could not meet, and possibly in NorthernIreland, voluntary recruitment for the Army should cease on the outbreak of war and that recruits shouldbe obtained throxigh the machinery of the NationalService (Armed Forces) Act.      It would still, ofcourse, be open to the Navy and Air Force to continuevoluntary recruitment.The Secretary of State for War asked for authority to make preparations on the above lines and to submit to those of his colleagues immediately concerned the text of an announcement on the subject which he suggested should be issued as soon as itwas clear that war was inevitable.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR explained the main points in his Paper which had been agreed with- - -the other Defence Ministers. -In discussion, the MINISTER OP LABOURexpressed the view that a decision to shut offvoluntary recruitment for the Army might haveundesirable psychological and political effects.    he also thought that the absence of voluntary recruitmentwould result in the Army failing to obtain theservices of a number of older men who would be valuableas noncommissioned officery or instructors, and that itwould not be dosirable to prevent recruitmentin the Army of older men who might lose their jobs inthe dislocation which would result on the outbreak ofwar.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR thought thatthe psychological point would be met by &quot;taking the names of the older men who wanted to volunteer andby, perhaps, arranging that a limited number of themmight be called up.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTERthought that while the principle set out in theSecretary of State for War&apos;s Paper should beaccepted, there might well be a good deal still tobe done in working out the scheme.     Further, thequestion of presentation was of great importance.He drew attention to the fact that under theSecretary of State for War&apos;s proposal the text of theannouncement should be submitted to those immediately concerned.

After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:(l) That the draft of the proposed announcement as to the policy to headopted in regard to voluntary recruitment on the outbreak of war should be considered by the followingMinistersThe Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster.       (Chairman).The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Privy Seal.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.The Minister of Labour.(2) That, in the event of failure to reach agreement, the matter should bereferred to the Prime Minister, orto the Cabinet,(3) That subject to any decision which maybe reached as a result of furtherconsideration of this matter by theMinisters referred to in (l) theNational Service (Arm^-Porces) Billshould be included in Category I ofWar Legislation.

9 Od 0TOTEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE and assistance.emergency legislation.6. The Cabinet had Id efore them a Memorandumby the Ministry of Labour (CP. 186 (39)) on thesubject of &quot;Emergency Legislation - UnemploymentInsurance and Unemployment Assistance&quot;,in which theMinister ashed for the authority of the Cabinet tointroduce,at the appropriate moment,Bills dealingwith these matters,which had been approved by theCommittee of Imperial Defence and were noted inthe Government War Boole.As regards Unemployment Insurance, it wasnecessary to table  power to modify the UnemploymentInsurance Scheme by regulations in certain respects,to provide for any necessary Financial adjustment andto obtain Parliamentary sanction for any increased expenditure out of monies provided by Parliament.As regards Unemployment Assistance, it wasnecessary to table  power to extend by regulationsthe scope of the Unemployment Assistance Scheme andto modify by regulations certain provisions of thescheme, to secure covering authority for allowancesmade otherwise than in compliance with the require-ments of the Act,and to obtain Parliamentary sanction for any increased expenditure out of monies providedby Parliament.It was pointed out that it would be necessaryto exercise the powers to be conferred by the Billsas soon as the Cabinet decided that the EvacuationScheme should be put into operation.After a short discussion the cabinet approved the proposals in the Ministerof Labour&apos;s Paper, summarised above.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.,30th August, 1939-

- MOST SECRET -(The following notes record what was saidat the Cabinet Meeting held on the 30thAugust (Cabinet 46 (39), Conclusion 1),relating to Mr D. the intermediary.)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidtha.t Mr &quot;D&quot; had seen Field Marshal Goering at midnight   Ion the previous night, and had returned to England that IImorning.    The Prime Minister and himself had had a talk Iwith him.   The main point which Mr &quot;D&quot; made was the remarkable effect of our reply in Berlin.   No quarrel    Iwas taken with the position we had taken up, and those pIwho were working for peace thought that it offered away out.    It was suggested that the atmosphere was rather like that of a nouveau-riche who found that he   ,1! was obtaining admission to the drawing-rooms of theGreat.    Field Marshal Goering, however, had been thrown into a state of almost hysterical anger bystories of Germans being shot.    But for our reply,war would have broken out on Tuesday morning.   That,together with our knowledge of German habits and methods, was the background against which we had toconsider the terms of our reply.Mr &quot;D&quot; had also said that the Germans felt thatin negotiations with the Poles they would, be facedwith unreasonable demands.    On the previous Thursdaythe Fuhrer had said that he meant to take back into germany all Polish territories which had been withinthe pre-war boundaries of Germany.   Field marshal goering, however, had persuaded him to limit thedemands to Danzig and the Corridor.   Field marshal goering was now discussing with Herr Hitler thefollowing as a basis of negotiation with the Poles:-Danzig to return to the Reich.   As to the Corridor,both sides should demobilise, and thereafter a

plebiscite to take place, on the Saar model.    If themajority went to Poland, Germany would be content witha corridor across the Corridor.    If the majority went to Germany, the Poles would be given two corridors,one to Danzig and one to Gdynia.   The reference tothe &quot;Saar model&quot; meant, presumably, that the Poleswho had been brought into the Corridor area since theWar would not be eligible to vote.    It was proposedthat the plebiscite should be under the control ofGreat Britain, Russia, or some neutral State.    It hadnot, however, yet been agreed that this should formthe basis of negotiations.At a later stage in the Meeting the foreign secretary read out a telegram which had. been receivedfrom Sir Howard Kennard, to x.he effect that the Polesthought that the basis of negotiations should be a compromise between the March demands and the status quo.The Polish view was that now that they had Prance andGreat Britain behind them, they could not concede infull demands which they had refused in March last.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this point of viewcovered the question of international guarantee.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,30th August, 1939 .
