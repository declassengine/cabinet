3-8THE INTER-national situation.The Positionin Tientsin,(previous reference:Cabinet 33(39), Con-clusion 3 .)The position at Swatow.1.    THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that his colleagues would have seen the Telegramfrom Sir Robert Craigie (No. 674 from Tokyo) setting out the text of the Communique which had. been agreed,with the Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs.The terms of the Communique, which would, be announced by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons that afternoon, were, he thought, satisfactory.    There were also indications that the local position at Tientsinwas improving.The Foreign Secretary also referred to a telegramfrom Sir Ronald. Lindsay (No. 283 from Washington)reporting that the feeling in Washington in regard tothe Far Eastern crisis was in strong support of the stand by His Majesty&apos;s Government, against Japan.The Foreign Secretary thought, that this was reassuring,and. sa.id that opinion in the United States would be strongly against our making any concessions to theJapanese on ti:.o dicier issues.The Foreign Secretary said that he had seen theAmerican Ambassador the previous afternoon.   A record of the conversation would be circulated, but it was clear that the American Government had. been using their influence discreetly in our favour.The Foreign Secretary said, that he had no recent information as to the position at Swatow.    The local representatives were taking such action as was within their power to prevent the imposition of unduerestrictions on the movements of British shipping,and at the same time to avoid, incidents .THE FIRST LORD OF ^HE ADMIRALS mentioned,  inthis  connection,  that, in ord.er to avoid the risk of incidents, it had been decided to hold up two ships at the bar.The Cabinet took note of thesesta.t ements *

THE INTER- 2,      THE SECRETARY OF&quot; SI-^IE, S03^Q3SSO^i..^SASJ(^RATIONAL.TUITION (Confd)   said that the Cabinet would have seen Sir WilliamRussia.r-eviousef erence:Cabinet 33 (39)Conclusion 1. )Seeds&apos; telegram (No. 137 from Moscow) reportingM, Molotov&apos;s answer to our latest proposals.      Itwas clear that there was now no likelihood that weshould he able to persuade M. Molotov to accept anarrangement based on two groups of States, and thatit would be necessary to make a further concession to M. Molotov&apos;s views if we were to reach agreement.The Foreign Policy Committee had considered thematter on Monday afternoon, and had reached theconclusion that it was necessary to take further steps to avoid a possible breakdown of the negotiations,and that, if need be, we must be prepared to acceptthe enumeration in the Treaty of the States coveredby  guarantees *The Foreign Secretary then read to hiscolleagues Telegram No0 151 to Moscow, containing the latest instructions to Sir William Seeds.     Assoon as these instructions had been agreed with theFrench Government, the proposals contained in them would be put to the Soviet Government.The Foreign Secretary thought that if we failed to reach agreement on the basis now proposed,there would be no possibility of reaching an agreementexcept on the basis of a simple tripartite pact.Some discussion ensued as to the circumstances in which we might become involved in war as a result of aggression against a Baltic State.      In this connectionattention was drawn to the terms of paragraph 6 of telegram No. 151 to Moscow.The Cabinet took note of the   foreign secretary&apos;s statement and approved theaction taken.

INDIA.The Defenceof.(previous reference:Cabinet 18(39), Con-elusion 8.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the question of the Defence of India:-(1) The Report of the Expert Committee,1938-39, presided over by LordChatfield (CP. 133(39)).(2) The Report of the Cabinet Committeeon the Defence of India (&quot;CP.  138(39))on the recommendations contained in theReport of the Expert Committee.The Summaries of Conclusions andRecommendations of the expert committee, and of the Cabinet Committee,are reproduced as Appendix I and appendix II respectively to these Minutes.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that in essence India&apos;s defence problemresulted from the fact that India had fallen behindin modernising hex1 military equipment and that itwas impossible for India to find the money requiredto bring it up to date.     At the same time, itwas vital that the Army and Air Force in India shouldhave the same equipment as was used by the Army andAir Force at home.The Secretary of State outlined the main points in the Pownall Report (Annex No. 2 to Paper No,CO.S. 737, itself attached as an Appendix to cp.  187 (38)) and in the two Reports (CP. 174(38)and CP. 187(38)) of the Cabinet Committee whichhad been presented to the Cabinet in the previousJuly.     One of the recommendations of the CabinetCommittee had been that a Committee of Inquiry should proceed to India&apos; to consider whether savings couldbe made in existing Indian Defence expenditure toset   against the cost of modernising the defence forces in India, and, in particular, to meet the

increased future maintenance charges involved inmodernisation and in improved conditions of service.The Secretary of State paid a tribute to the verythorough and clear Report which Lord Chatfield&apos;sCommittee had produced in so short a space of time.The secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that the reorganisation proposals in the chatfield Report had been fully considered by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.     The Committee onthe Defence of India under his chairmanship were satisfied that there was no alternative to theproposals in the Chatfield Report and accepted therassubject to the various points mentioned in theirReport.The following were the main points dealtwith in the course of the discussion:The principles THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEunderlying the chatfield Report   said that the witnesses before his Committee,(paragraphs 18and 13 of CP.       speaking under the condition that their words would138(39)).not be repeated, had shown anxiety that we shouldmake it known that we were not prepared to abandon the defence of India.      They realised that if this happened there would be internal disorder on alarge scale.     He was also impressed with theignorance on defence matters shown by Indians.At the present time, defence was a resex^ved subject,and could not be discussed.     It was in his viewessential that there should be more opportunityfor discussion on defence matters.It was pointed out, however, that the fitfstprinciple stated in paragraph 12, namely the ultimate responsibility of the British Government for theDefence of India, was expressed in terms which might

Qo*i.M* &quot; Lash.....A /kbe somewhat difficult to reconcile with previouspublished statements as to the constitutional position v/hen Federal Government had beenestablished.THE SECHETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said thatthe Chatfield Report and the Conclusions reachedupon it would not be published as such.     Hethought that it would be necessary to publish a carefully-worded despatch from himself to theViceroy which would contain as much of the chatfield Report as it was decided should be made public.Discussion then turned to the second principle on which the Report was based, namely, that india should bear some share in Joint responsibility forher external security.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA thought thatit was essential to make some broad statement ofDefence Policy, and of our reasons for it.In this connection reference v/as made to paragraph 14 of CP. 138(39) in which it was pointedout that the Viceroy held that a declaration tothis effect might lead to a major political crisis,but that he was prepared to face this risk if hewas assured of the support of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin any measures which he might find it necessary totake in this event.Some apprehension was expressed whether this undertaking was not expressed in verj- wide terms, andwhether it was expedient to take any action whichmight result in a major political crisis at thepresent time.  To this it was replied that the position inIndia was now relatively quiet.      The Viceroy would,no doubt, take an opportunity of sounding the ground- 5 -

disbandment of RegularUnits.(Paragraphs29 &amp; 30 ofC.P.138( 39)),The RoyalAir Forcein India,The BorderProblem.(Paragraphs31 to 34 of cp.138(39)).before making any announcement, and would report if hethought that the time was not propitious.    In any eventthere was no intention of making an early announcement.It was also suggested that if these principleswere announced as conditions attached to the verygenerous financial assistance to be afforded by theBritish Exchequer towards the cost of the modernisation of our Forces in India, the announcement as a whole wouldbe well received.In reply to the Secretary of State for &quot;War,the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that while theGovernment of India could not undertake to accept theupkeep of surplus Indian units beyond the period of afurther twelve months set out in the Report, he was prepared to agree that no steps should be taken to disband surplus Indian units without prior consultationwith the Secretary of State for War.-   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS,said that the Chatfield Committee had been much concerned about the differences of opinion onborder policy of responsible authorities in India.The Viceroy had been asked to report on a proposal that the frontier policy should be reviewed.    Hethought that   an   enquiry by a Committee with a chairman chosen from outside India might be necessary.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said that two important considerations were involvedin frontier policy: first whether the tribes should bedisarmed and, secondly, whether it was desirable thatthe present arrangements whereby the regular troopsheld the outer posts, supported by the scouts, shouldbe reversed.    One view held was that if the present policy was reversed, it would be possible to make more

use of air forces.    It was generally held, however,that while greater use of air forces would reduce theexpenditure incurred in military operations, it wouldnot enable us to manage with fewer troops.The Minister added, however, that what haddisturbed his Committee had been not so much the questionof the merits of the forward or close frontier policy,but the need for ensuring that whatever policy wasadopted was properly co-ordinated.    At the present time,there was no concerted plan of action or generally accepted view as to the proper method of giving effectto the frontier policy.    It was clearly wrong that so important a question should be in so grave a state of uncertainty.    The problem, however, was an Indianproblem which would have to be settled in India.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR supported thisview. His Department had been pressing for a solutionof the question for a number of years. He was anxious that there should be no farther delay, and he thoughtthat there was a possibility that some saving could beeffected by the adoption of some properly co-ordinatedand definite policy.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said thatthe Viceroy had had this matter under his personalconsideration ever since the Chatfield Committee had left India.    A preliminary appreciation of the problemhad now been prepared and was under consideration by asmall Expert Committee in India which had called forcomments from the various Departments concerned.

Number ofR.A.F.Squadrons.When the appreciation had been revised in the light ofthese comments, it would be forwarded to him (theSecretary of State) and he would submit it to theCabinet.   He therefore favoured no action until thisappreciation had been received.Several Ministers expressed the viewthat this matter should be proceeded with withoutdelay.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said that the number of R.A.F. Squadrons requiredfor local needs was one of the matters on which his committee had not been able to reach agreement,     he-^*r--r^epTe^eni?a^4ave^on-his Committee had thought that6 Bomber Squadrons should be provided for local defence purposes instead of 4-y&quot; It was clear,however, that India could not meet the maintenancecosts of her defence forces if the number of bomber Squadrons was increased from 4 to 6.    TheCommander-in-Chief in India, who was responsible forthe Indian war plan,said that his requirements didnot exceed 4 Bomber Squadrons.      He (the Minister)had thought that the only way to settle thematter was to invite the Commander-in-Chief tocome to London to discuss the matter with theCommittee of Imperial Defence.    It was right that this course should be adopted, since, if india was involved in war and it was found that 4Bomber Squadrons were not enough for local

defence purposes, calls would be made on theresources of this country.Financial THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSPoints.explained briefly the financial proposals.    The(Paragraphs36 to 48 of Chancellor of the Exchequer had agreed to provideCP. 138(39)).the whole capital cost of modernising the defence forces in India, estimated at  34.3 millions, ofwhich three-quarters would be a gift and one quarter a loan.    This offer was the subject ofcertain conditions set out in paragraphs 38 to 40of CP.  138 (39).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR referredto the statement in paragraph 39 in regard toresponsibility for any increased maintenance charges which might result from,  e.g. , improvementseffected in the conditions of service of theBritish soldier at home.    He had hoped that theReport would make more explicit India&apos;s liability to meet her share of the cost of any further improvement in amenities.In the course of discussion it was explained by the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA that india would, so far as she was able, meet hershare of any further increases in expendituredue to improvements in conditions of service.Nevertheless, it was impossible for the Governmentof India to undertake that they would never under any circumstances submit a clsim for some relief in  .respect of further increases in expenditure on accountof changes in conditions of service, or, alternatively

HigherDirection ofIndianDefence.(Paragraphsthat India would not say that if the cost of Britishtroops increased it would he necessary that india should employ fewer British troops.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggested thatthe paragraph, as at present worded in the Summary of recommendations to CP. 138 (39) (paragraph 57 (13)),did not perhaps fully bring out the real position, whichwas that, while a definite rule could not be laid down for all cases, the presumption was that India would pay any increased maintenance charges and that an exception to this rule would only be allowed in regard to some large additional claim which India was not able to meet.It was suggested that the position would beclearer if the words &quot;of principle&quot;, in line 8 onpage 13 of CP. 138 (39), were deleted.This was agreed to.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat the position of the Air Officer Commanding inrelation to the Commander-in-Chief was not in his opinion5h-56 of cp. 138 (39))   satisfactory.     At the same time, it was clear that theposition had greatly improved in the last two or threeyears and that more use was now being made of the air.He gave instances to show that reluctance to have recourse to air blockade was often due to the politicaland not to the military authorities.      This again was aquestion which he thought would have to be settled inIndia.      Having regard to the fact that the Armyrepresented 85 per cent, of India&apos;s total defence forces,it was clear that the Commander-in-chief must continueunder any system to occupy a rather dominating position.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR AIR said that all he asked was that the matter should be enquired into&quot;-without any undue delay.- 10 -

THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR DOMINION affairs said it had been suggested by the Secretary of Statefor Air that this matter should be investigated by theCabinet Committee on the Defence of India.     TheCommittee was prepared to investigate the matter,  if so directed.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that, in matters of this kind, the views of theViceroy and the Commander-in-Chief were of first importance.     He rather doubted,therefore, whether thematter could be settled by an inquiry in this country.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said thatthe Commander-in-Chief was not merely Commander-in-Chief of the Army, he was also   Minister ofDefence in the Government of India.     His constitutional position was therefore quite different from that ofthe Air Officer Commanding.      If the Cabinet wished the present system to be altered, he would, of course,ask the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief for an expression of their views.     His colleagues would,however, be aware that when Federation came into force,the constitutional position of the Commander-in-Chiefwould automatically be altered.     Was it v/orth while to alter a system now which -was due to be altered in a few years time?In the course of further discussion, itwas explained that there was no way in which the air officer Commanding or the Officer in Command of theIndian Navy could submit their views to the Viceroy,other than through the Commander-in-Chief, who had theright to veto the submission of papers by them.      Itwas pointed out that the Air Officer Commanding had aright of access to the Viceroy, if the Commander-in-Chief proposed to veto the submission of a paper which- 11 -

Cor-ordinationof defence&quot;between HisMajesty1sGovernment andthe Governmentof India,Position ofthe Princes,he had prepared.     The view was, however,expressed that this system was likely to lead tofriction.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the nextstep should be for the Viceroy to be consulted.The position as seen by the Cabinet should be explained to him, and he should be asked to say whether he thought that the matter should beenquired into now, or should wait until the position regarding the coming into force of Federation was somewhat clearer.     He should also be asked tostate his own views on the merits of the presentsystem.     He suggested that the Secretary of Statefor India, the Minister for Co-ordination of defence and the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs should consult as to the terms of the despatch to besent to the Viceroy.This course was agreed to.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that from what he had seen on his visit toIndia he was not altogether satisfied that steps had*in fact, been taken to set up a body corresponding to the Committee of Imperial Defence.It was agreed that the Secretary of Statefor India&apos; should enquire what steps had been takenin this directionTHE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that, although this matter was not mentionedin the Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report, he wished torefer to the grievances of the Princes that theywere not allowed to have sufficient arms with which to equip their Forces.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA aaidthat there were two sides to this question, since itwas not right to supply arms to the Princes if their forces were not capable of making proper use of them.The matter was constantly under investigation by theViceroyoTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that the chatfield Report was a landmark in military history.It made for greater flexibility and for co-operationbetween the Army at Home and the Army in India.Hitherto the number of troops that we kept in india had been a primary consideration-which had largelygoverned, the number of troops in this country.      Hethought that the Chatfield Report might lead to some alteration In the Oar&amp;weJl system and might enable usto retain forces here at full strengthsTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he thought it would be convenient that theCabinet Committee on the Defence of India should remain in being.     He suggested, however, that themost convenient course would be that the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence should now take overthe Chairmanshipo      He pointed out that he hadretained the Chairmanship of this Committee in orderthat the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence shouldnot be in the position of Chairman of the Committeewhich was considering his own Report.     He thought,however, that at the present juncture it would be convenient that the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence should new take over the Chairmanship.This was agreed to.

5 1lThe Cabinet:(1)   Approved the Report of the CabinetCommittee (CP. 138 (39)). on therecommendations contained in theReport of the Expert Committee(CP. 133 (39)), subject to the deletion of the words &quot;of principle&quot;in line 8 on page 13 of CP. 138 (39):(2)   Jfegre&amp;d that no steps should be taken to disband surplus Indian units without prior consultation with the Secretaryof State for War:(3)   Authorised the Secretary of State forIndia to arrange for the Commander-in-Chief in India to visit this country inthe autumn for discussions on defence matters:(k)   Authorised the Secretary of State forIndia, in consultation with the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs,to consult the Viceroy as to the higherdirection of Indian Defence, on the lines indicated in the Cabinet discussion:(5)   Invited the Secretary of State for Indiato enquire what steps had been taken toset up in India a body corresponding tothe Committee of Imperial Defence:(6)    Agreed that the Cabinet Committee on theDefence of India should continue in being to consider any further matters whichmight arise as a result of the communications now to be made to theGovernment of India, and that the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence should takeover the Chairmanship of the Committeefrom the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.- Ik -

PALESTINE. 4c THE SECRETARY OP STATS P03. THE COLONIES(Previous Reference: said that he had given the Permanent MandatesCabinet 29(39),Conclusion 5.) Commission at Geneva a general statement of theFfS. 3^(3^)^- considerations which the Government had had inmind in framing the policy set-out in the white paper on Palestine.    He had subsequentlyanswered questions for two-and-a-half days.   Thegeneral attitude of.the Permanent mandates commission had been friendly/ and generous inappreciation of the good work which the Administra-tion had carried out.   The members of theCommission also fully realised that, as a resultof our responsibilities in Palestine, we had a farwider knowledge of the situation than members ofthe Commission possessed and that our views mustcarry weight.    But, with the exception ofLord Hankey,  the members of the Commission had never been associated with responsibility in political matters and their views were, he was afraid, somewhat academic, and they had far too little appreciation of the situation which existed in Palestine.    Further, Jewish propagandahad been active at Geneva for a number of yearsand had had considerable effect.The Colonial Secretary said that hethought he had shaken the views of s^se^ai. membersof the Commission.    He feared, however, that weshould not get a majority report to the effectthat the White Paper policy was within theterms of the Mandate.   The present indications$ were that four members of the Commission would hold

that the policy was not within the terms of theMandate, while three held that it was within those terms *   He anticipated that the report would takethe line that the Commission were divided on this issue and would give the arguments on &quot;both sides.Whilst the report might not indicate that amajority of the Commission were disposed tothink that the White Paper policy was not withinthe terms of the Mandate, he thought that this fact might well become known.   The report wouldnot be published until the end of August, shortly before the meeting of the Council in September.The views of the Council would, of course, be far more important than the views of the permanent mandates Commission and he hoped that theCouncil might be persuaded to agree to ourproceeding with&apos;the policy set out in the white paper without any alteration in the terms of theMandate,    If this should not prove possible, weshould then have to invite the Council toconsider some alteration in the Mandate, but thispoint need not be considered for the present.In reply to a question, the colonial secretary said that the main point on which itappeared likely that the Commission would holdthat the White   Paper policy was not within theterms of the Mandate, was the prohibition of jewish immigration into Palestine after fiveyears, unless the Arabs acquiesced in such furtherimmigration.The Cabinet took note of this statement*

- 17 -MILK INDUSTRY   5. The Cabinet had under consideration theBILL.following documents relating to the Milk Industry(previous reference:       Bill:-Cabinet 32(39), Con- (l) A Joint Memorandum by the Minister of elusion 10.) Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretaryof State for Scotland (HeA.  26 (39)),covering the draft Milk Industry Bill, theprincipal objects of which were to make provision for Exchequer payments in respectof the production of quality milk; of thesale of milk at reduced prices to schoolchildren and to mothers and young children;and of the use of milk for the manufactureof butter and cheese: the proposals to cover the period from the 1st October, 1939, tothe 30th September, 1940i(2) The following conclusions and recommendationsthereon by the Committee of Home Affairs(H.A.G. 14th Conclusions (39)):-(i) that it was important that the continuationand other essential provisions of the milk Industry Bill should be passed into law before the summer recess, which,according to present arrangements, would begin on the 4th August, 1939:(ii) that i.n view of the volume of parliamentary business remaining to be transacted beforethe above date, it was desirable that thescope of the Bill should be less widethan in the present draft.In this connection it was pointed out,  inparticular, that it would be an advantage if the long title could be more narrowlydrawn.(iii) To recommend the Cabinet to give instructions for the omission of Clauses8 and 9, and of the Second Schedule, ofthe present draft Bill; and for thepreparation of a separate Bill (applyingonly to Scotland) embodying theprovisions of Clause 8 and of the second schedule, with a view to its intro-duction before the summer recess, and its passage into law as early as possible after that recess:(iv) To recommend the Cabinet to authorise&apos;theintroduction forthwith in the House ofCommons, with a view to its passage into law before the summer recess, of the milk Industry Bill in the form of thedraft annexed to H.A.  26 (39), subject(a) to the omissions indicated at(iii) above, and(b) to any drafting or other minor^alterations that may be foundnecessary or desirable:

(3) A note by the Minister of x-xgri culture andFisheries and the Secretary of State forScotland (&quot;CP.-139 (39)) submitting forthe approval of their colleagues, inaccordance with the Conclusion noted inthe margin, a re-draft (prepared inconsultation with die Minister of Health)of the statement to be made, on theintroduction of interim milk legislation during the currect session, as to theGovernment&apos;s attitude to long-term milkpolicy, including the question of milkdistribution costs.THE UIHISTER OF .JJRI CULTURE iiHD PI&amp;IiERIiiSexplained the main alterations which had been madein order to lighten the Bill, and to meet the viewsput forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury.    The draft statement to be made on theintroduction of interim milk legislation (CP.  139(59)) was not affected by t,iO alterations made in theBill,THE PRESIDENT uF THE BOARD OF TR.-DE said he had some drafting amendments to suggest whichhe would communicate to the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries.Some discussion took place whether the words&quot;in the present Bill, which is essentially an interim measure!!- in line 5 of the second paragraphof the draft statement should be omitted on thegrounds that the Tribunal of Enquiry (Evidence)Act could be made applicable by Resolutions of bothHouses of Parliament and did not involve newlegislative action,THE diisHCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, however,said that it would be difficult for him to agreeto any statement which made it clear that no

immediate action was going to be taken in regardto the cost of milk distribution, unless thestatement also made it clear that the position for the future was open.    He, therefore, favoured the retention of these wordSoThis was agreed to.THE SSGRLtARY OF-STAiU; FOR SCOTLAND said that clause S in the Bill as originally drafted hadbeen designed to empower the extension of milk marketing Schemes to certain az*eas in the Highlands^He was prepared to agree that this matter should be postponed.    He would like authority to bring in aBill to this efxect before the House of Commons rose,on the understanding that the Bill should not be passed before the Recess.    He was, however,considering whether it would, in fact, be necessary thatthe Bill should be introduced before the House rose.The Cabinet agreed:(l)    To approve the recommendations ofthe Home Affairs Commit tee inregard to the Milk Industry Bill,as set out above.(2)    To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to introduce, withoutfurther reference to the Home AffairsCommittee, a Bill extending the milk marketing Schemes to certain areasin the Highlands, on the understandingthat this Bill could not be passed into lav/ before the Recess.(5)    To approve the re-draft of theStatement submitted by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland onthe Long-term Milk Policy (CP.  139 &apos;(39)) to be made on the secondreading of the Interim Milk industry bill.

LAW REFORM(miscellaneous provisions)(SCOTLAND).ProposedAmendingLegislation.(previous reference:Cabinet 52(38), Con-clusion 5 and appendix II).6.       The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. 140(39)), in which he sought the authority of hiscolleagues for the preparation and submission tothe Committee of Home Affairs, of a Bill to amend the law of Scotland on a number of technicalpoints which had been examined by a Committee ofmembers of the legal professions acting at the requestof the Lord Advocate, and corresponding to theLaw Revision Committee, appointed by the LordChancellor, in England.    After setting out thematters proposed to be dealt with in the Bill, theMemorandum proceeded to point out that theintroduction of the Bill was desired merely with aview to circulation and publication, and theopportunity thereby afforded of obtaining the viewsof the legal profession and of others who might be interested.    It was not proposed that any attempt should be made to pass the Bill into law during thecurrent Session.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed -to authorise the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to introduce this Bill,on the understanding that the bill could not be passed into law Session,the current Session.

HONG-KONG. The Cabinet had under consideration a proposed Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theCompulsoryService Colonies (CP. Ih2 (39)) in which it was statedOrdinancesthat the Governor of Hong-Kong, with the strong support of the Naval Commander-in-Chief and theGeneral Officer Commanding and the unanimousapproval of the Executive Council, was anxious to enact as soon as possible legislation providingfor the application of compulsory service to allmedically fit male British subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 ordinarily resident in the Colony.The intention was, however, to call up under themeasure only British subjects of European descent.With the exception of men in certain &quot;key&quot;employment, persons so called up would be allocatedeither to naval, military or air service, or toessential non-combatant defence duties.       Thevolunteer forces in Hong-Kong were substantial and efficient but the local situation was such that adequate preparations to meet an emergency required the most complete arrangements for the training and allocation of all available British man-power in theColony.      The Admiralty and War Office strongly supported the proposed measure, and the ForeignOffice saw no objection to it in the presentCircumstances of the Far East.     The Secretary ofState therefore proposed, subject to the concurrence of his   colleagues,   to authorise the enactment ofthis measure in Hong-Kong without delay.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES-explained that the obligations of service would be rather similar to those undertaken by members of theTerritorial Forces and would not prevent the men called up from following their ordinary occupations.The course proposed was supported by all the Departmentsconcerned, but as a new principle was involved, he had thought it right to submit the matter to the Cabinet.The Cabinet approved the enactment of the proposedcompulsory Service Ordinancein Hong Kong.

LIVERPOOL.Provision dfVoluntarySenior Schools.(previous reference:cabinet 33(39), Con-clusien 9.)8. THE PRESIDEM1 OF THE BOARD OFEDUCATION said that the Bill which had beenapproved in. principle by the Cabinet at their previous meeting would be submitted to theHone Affairs Committee on the following Monday&apos;iHe asked that if the Home Affairs committee approved the Bill, it might be introducedforthwith, without   further reference to theCabinet.     This was especially important sincethe Bill was a hybrid one, the parliamentary procedure in regard to which was somewhatlengthy.     Negotiations were proceeding and he hoped that the Bill could be introduced after11.0 p.m. in the House of Commons,,The Cabinet authorised thePresident of the Board ofEducation to arx^ange for theintroduction of the Bill inquestion i.n .the House ofCommons without further reference to the Cabinet,subject, however, to theapproval of the Home AffairsCommittee.

EXPORT CREDITSLEGISLATION.Supply of arms to Turkey and poland.(previous reference cabinet 33(59)Conclusion 8).9. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER remindedbis colleagues that at the previous mee/fcisig theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had be.e&amp;invited to submit to him a statement indicating theamount of additional non-commercial credits wh^oh^.in his opinion,, should be granted to the countries concerned, and that this statement would be *considerad by Mm (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)and the colleagues who were associated with him in considering the financial position.     The foreign secretary had submitted such a statement.     Thetotal ^ssmmb was rather disturbing and amounted to 51 millions, or, if provision was made for interest on these long-term credits, a total of  80 millions.It had been evident that the most urgentpoint was to secure immediate decisions as to the credits to be made available to Turkey and Poland.A Report had been submitted by the Deputy Chiefs ofStaff which from the strategical point of view had placed Turkey extremely high and put Poland on a lower level.     The matter had been considered as fully as was possible on the material available,and certain conclusions had been reached as to theaction which he and his colleagues were prepar-ed toThere were, however, a number of pointsoutstanding which had not been discussed by theForeign Secretary or by the Service Ministers, andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer thought itdesirable that a meeting of the Ministers concerned should be held to examine the matter as soon aspossible.     It was explained that a Memorandum was- 2k -

being prepared for issue that afternoon setting outthe main  acts as   to   the demands made by turkey and Folandj so far as they had been ascertained.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he agreed with this course and he was most anxious that matters should be settledexpeditioualy.    He understood that a delegation from Greece had been here for six months withoutthe negotiations being finally concluded;, and hethought that it might be necessary to examine whether the machinery for dealing with thesecases could not be improved.     He did not.however, propose to enlarge on this matter further on the present occasion.The Cabinet agreed -That a meeting of the following ministers:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(or his representative).The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (or his representative).The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.The President of the Board of Trade.should be held at 6 p.m. that eveningin the House of Commons to consider what action should be taken in regard to thedemands for credits put forward by turkey and Poland.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,28th June, 19 &amp;9.

APPENDIX I.[CP. 133 (39).]SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF the expert COMMITTEE ON THE DEFENCE OF INDIA 1938-9,Constitutional and Political Aspects (Chapter 1).253. In considering the problem set before us in our terms of reference, ithas been essential for us to acquaint ourselves with the general political situationin India, and in particular, to endeavour to gauge the political tendencies thatseem likely to develop with the introduction of Federation, seeing that our recommendations, and the principles which govern them, involve a programmeextending over a number of years, and we assume that Federation will come into being within that period (paragraph 8).254. We have been impressed by the ignorance or blindness displayed in indian political circles as to the true facts of the position in regard to Defence,and by the necessity of educating Indian public opinion to a proper realisation of the strategic problems which govern the security of the country (paragraph 12).The growing cleavage between the great Hindu and Moslem communities has beenbrought prominently before us, and we stress its importance as a factor to beconsidered in determining the strength and organisation of the defence forces inIndia for Internal Security. The difference of outlook in defence matters betweenthe two communities is pronounced (paragraph 13). We have been speciallyimpressed by the general anxiety in the minds of so many of the witnesses wehave heard, both official and non-official, as to the future, and particularly asto whether the safeguards relating to Defence at the Federal Centre would be effective (paragraphs 16-19).255. We have been able to proceed on no other assumption than that asettled defence policy can and will be laid down in accordance with the principlethat the responsibility for the defence of India rests with the British Government,and that this responsibility will not be weakened whatever political pressure is brought to bear on the Government of India either before, or after the coming of,Federation. This assumption appears to us to be essential not only to thecontinuity of any plans based on our recommendations, but, indeed, to the making of defence plans of such a general and far-reaching nature as we have been called on to make (paragraph 19).Strategical appreciation (Chapter 2).256. We have reviewed the general strategical situation as regards theWestern Frontier, the other land frontiers of India, and the risk to Indians sea communications; and in Chapter 4 we have emphasised the importance to india of the great changes in the world situation that have developed in the last six years. While the old dangers to India&apos;s land frontiers remain latent, newrisks both as regards Japan&apos;s aggressive attitude and the changed Mediterraneansituation have arisen which seriously threaten her external security.257. We conclude that India&apos;s defence plans must provide not only forthe contingency of Afghan aggression and the possibility of assistance by great powers, coupled with widespread tribal disturbance, but also to an increasing extent for the protection of her sea communications in Eastern waters and the strategic points which are vital to their security (paragraph 31).The Western Frontier (Chapter 3).The general policy and its application (Chapter 3, Section 1).258. The measures taken to give effect to the present &quot; Forward Policy &quot;of the Government of India in the tribal areas of the Western Frontier have avery important bearing on the defence forces of India. We have therefore madethe widest survey that has been possible to us of the subject and have heardevidence on it from a large number of military and political officers.[19511] b
259. We are disturbed by the nature of the evidence we have received,indicating as it does the widest difference of view among important officials asto the merits or the purposes of the measures now in operation and as to thewisest methods of achieving the aim of the Forward Policy.260. We recommend that very early steps should be taken to review theFrontier Policy in its entirety with the object not only of clarifying the policy, butalso of defining the practical objectives to be aimed at and the methods by whichthey are to be reached (paragraph 47).The Employment of Air Forces (Chapter 3, sections 2 and 3).261. We have dealt at some length with the question of the employment ofair forces in the tribal areas on the Western Frontier as it has in the past beenthe subject of controversy. We found in the Royal Air Force, both in Londonand India, a feeling that the air resources at the disposal of the Government ofIndia had not always been employed in such a way as to secure the most advantageous effect by the most economical method (paragraph 50).262. We are satisfied that there has been a notable advance in understandingin the last few years as to the use of the air forces* and we draw attention to various measures which we hope will promote it still further. We have alsoascertained in evidence that it is the accepted policy to avoid offensive operations by land forces in circumstances which clearly indicate that the object in viewcan be obtained by air action alone (paragraphs 50-55).The three main methods of using Air Forces in a primary role(Chapter 3, Section 3).263. We describe the various methods of using air forces in a primary roleand make certain comments thereon (paragraphs 57-63).Principles governing the scales of the forces and the financial arrangements between the British and Indian Governments (Chapter26$. We wish to draw particular attention to Chapter 4 of our Report inwhich we have discussed fully the principles which in our opinion should govern the scales of the defence forces in India and the financial arrangements betweenthe British Government and the Government of India.t/We recommend: (i) That the broad lines of division between Indian and Imperialresponsibility for defence and the distinction between the &quot;minor&quot;and the &quot; major danger &quot; drawn in the Garran Tribunal report should no longer be applied to determine the respective liabilities ofthe two Governments (paragraph 69).(ii) That the external defence of India should be regarded as a joint responsibility of the two Governments and that the financial arrange-ments between them should be based on the principle that India should bear a share in the joint responsibility and that these arrangements should as far as is financially possible give effect to the principle(paragraph 69).(iii) That, in addition to the forces required for the local defence of India,forces should be maintained in India to assist in her external defence,and that these forces, although maintained by India for the purposesof the joint responsibility, should form an integral part of the forcesof India as a whole. We deprecate the use of a title such as &apos;&apos; ImperialReserve,&quot; implying as it does a distinction between Indian and imperial responsibilities which we wish to avoid in this connection(paragraph 71).* See note by Air Marshal Courtney appended to the Report.
That the defence plans of the two Governments should be co-ordinatedand merged in the general war plans which would prescribe the use and duties of the forces in India. We recognise that there may beoccasions as in the past when the Government of India may be ready and willing to make forces available for purposes going beyond the external defence of India (paragraphs 73 and 74).That in accordance with the principle of joint responsibility and havingregard to the strength and composition of the forces proposed, thesubsidy now paid by the British Government to India under theGarran Award might reasonably be continued at the higher level of 2,000,000 a year (paragraph 75).That if forces held in India for her external defence are used outsideIndia for that purpose their ordinary maintenance charges shouldcontinue to be borne by India; and the apportionment of the extracharges between Imperial and Indian funds should be agreed by thetwo Governments at the time, regard being had to all the circumstancesof the emergency (paragraph 75).War Plans.265. We recommend that the plans for the use of armed forces in the defenceof India in war should as a matter of course be the subject of the closestconsultation between the defence authorities in India and the Committee ofImperial Defence before the approval of the two Governments; and we areinformed that the Government of India would welcome the suggestion(paragraph 76).The reorganisation proposals (Chapter 5).266. We relate that in the summer of 1938 the Commander-in-Chief hadinitiated a new and comprehensive review of India&apos;s local defence requirements in respect of all three defence services. The results were placed before us inevidence and we have discussed them in close touch with the Commander-in-Chief,who has made several important modifications in his proposals as a result ofour joint consultations. The &quot; proposals &quot; to which we refer throughout therest of the Report are the proposals so modified (paragraphs 78 and 79).The reorganisation of the Army (Chapter 6).267. We recall that the Chiefs of Staff and the Cabinet Committee had stressed the importance of placing India&apos;s defence organisation on a moreup-to-date and satisfactory basis. We have regarded this as a mandate, as is indeed implied in our terms of reference (paragraph 84).268. At the outset we examined the possibility of organising the troopsin India into separate specialised bodies, and give our reasons for rejecting it(paragraphs 86 and 87).269. Our conclusion is that the whole of the troops in India should bemodernised on a practically uniform scale both on general grounds and becauseof the need for ensuring that the British forces in India are interchangeable withthose on the Imperial establishment (paragraphs 88 and 89). We consider thatif this work is not Undertaken India will be unable to play her proper part in defence and might well become a most embarrassing commitment in time of trouble (paragraph 251).270. The strategic assumption underlying the Commander-in-Chief&apos;proposal is that in an Empire war, unless the situation is particularly favourable,no large-scale offensive operations will be undertaken against the tribes on theIndian side of the Durand Line, or across it against Afghan troops and tribes.On this basis we recommend acceptance of the general purport of the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s proposals which is  (i) to assess the troops required as a safe minimum in war for the purely local defence of India on the assumption that the whole of these forces will be modernised;[19511] B 2(?)(vi)
(ii) to modernise them accordingly on a scale generally resembling that adopted for troops on the Imperial establishment;(iii) to distribute these modernised troops on a new basis;(iv) out of the surplus that will then remain to retain a number of troops which will be available for purposes other than purely local defence;(v) to modernise this number of troops on a somewhat higher scale than isproposed for the forces required for local defence;(vi) to deal with any balance that may still remain by withdrawing theBritish units and reducing the Indian units for which employmentcannot be provided in oversea garrisons (paragraphs 85 and 90).Proposed allotment of troops.271. The new categories which replace the former &quot; Field Army,&quot;&quot;Covering Troops&quot; and &quot;Internal Security Troops&quot; are &quot;Frontier defence troops,&quot; &quot; Internal Security Troops,&quot; &quot; Coast Defence Troops &quot; and &quot; TheGeneral Reserve.&quot; Their respective functions are briefly described in para-graph 92; the proposed allotment of troops to the new categories is given inparagraph 99; and that of the remaining surplus (see paragraph 270 (iv)above) in paragraph 100.We recommend that the proposed allotment of troops to the above categoriesshould be accepted (paragraph 107).Internal Security.272. We have given particular attention to the proposed strength of theInternal Security troops. At our request the proposals have been communicatedto the Provincial Governors, and we have been informed that they regard them as generally satisfactory. We accept the assurance of the Commander-in-Chiefthat the proposed allotment will provide an adequate minimum insurance againstthe &quot;worst contingency &quot; a world war accompanied by hostilities on the frontier and widespread civil unrest on the necessary assumption that we can rely on thecontinued loyalty of the Indian Army and need not contemplate any widespreaddisaffection among the police (paragraph 106).External Defence Troops.273. We have considered the suggestion of the General Staff in India for providing a reserve available for purposes other than the local defence of India;and we regard them as providing the requisite strength for what we term &quot; the external Defence Troops.&quot;On the hypothesis that the War Office may now ask for the withdrawal ofone British Cavalry regiment and two British Infantry battalions from India,in addition to those already withdrawn, we recommend that the Cavalry and infantry components of the External Defence troops should consist of 1 BritishCavalry regiment, and 3 British and 7 Indian Infantry battalions (para-graph 111).Withdrawal and reduction of units.274. On this hypothesis, the total number of British units to be withdrawnfrom India would be 1 Cavalry regiment, 3 Royal Horse Artillery batteries,1 Field Artillery regiment, 1 Medium Artillery regiment and 2 infantry battalions (paragraphs 112 and 113).275. A total of 3 Indian Cavalry regiments, 4 companies of Sappers and miners, and 14 Indian Infantry battalions would have to be reduced unless aswe hope would be possible employment can be found for them in oversea 4garrisons (paragraph 119). We conclude that the necessity for reductions mustbe faced and accepted, and that we have no option but to recommend accordingly(paragraph 120).
Equipment of the Local Defence Troops.276. We deal in Section 4 with the proposals for the equipment of thetroops required for local defence, and we recommend that, subject to certaincomments, they should be accepted (paragraph 123).277. We are of opinion that the composition proposed for a Cavalry brigadein the General Reserve might be further considered (paragraph 124).Suggestions for Economies.278. We note a number of measures in regard to which improvements oreconomies may be found possible when the scheme as a whole is further reviewed by the defence authorities in India (paragraph 126 and Appendix Y).Equipment of the External Defence Troops.279. We recommend approval of the somewhat higher scale of equipmentproposed for the External Defence troops (paragraph 137 and Appendix IV).Time-table of Modernisation.280. We recommend that the proposal to complete modernisation in S years should be accepted and that the time-table referred to in Section 5 should beadopted. We call particular attention to the need for placing early orders forthe equipment of the External Defence Troops whose requirements would be given priority (paragraph 143).Major savings effected by the modernisation proposals.281. We tabulate in Section 6 the major heads under which savings are tobe anticipated as the result of the reorganisation and modernisation proposals(paragraph 145).Office establishments.282. We deal in Section 8 with the possibilities of effecting economies inthe office establishments connected with the defence organisation (para-graphs 151-158).Conditions of service of British troops in India.283. We review in Section 9 the conditions of service of British troops inIndia, and conclude that they may be considered generally satisfactory, havingregard to Indian conditions, though the standard of barrack accommodationshould be brought up to date as funds become available. We discuss the questionof reducing the term of service in India to 4 years (paragraphs 159-163).The Strength of the Air Forces (Chapter 7).284. The question of the strength of the air forces required for the local defence of India has proved one of considerable difficulty. On reaching India,we found that the defence authorities had reconsidered the strategical plan forthe conduct of war with Afghanistan. They do not now regard as essential theproposal which the Chiefs of Staff had had before them for a vigorous and sustained air offensive against that country from the outset of the war. In viewof this change of plan the Commander-in-Chief considers that the minimum requirements for local defence would be satisfied by the provision of 4 bomber squadrons, 3 Army Co-operation squadrons and 1 Bomber Transport squadron,two of the Bomber squadrons having a primary role of Coast Defence, but being available on the Frontier if not needed or when no longer needed for coast defence(paragraphs 164-167).[19511] b 3
285. We have based our financial appreciation of the defence forces as awhole on these proposals of the Commander-in-Chief so far as local defence isconcerned, and on the provision of two further Bomber squadrons which werecommend as India&apos;s share of the joint responsibility for external defence(paragraphs 182 and 183).286. We have, however, been unable to reach agreement among ourselves on the number of Bomber squadrons which should be provided for local defence and our differing views are explained in paragraphs 169 and 170. We have pointed out that if, as we propose, all strategic plans affecting India are the subjectof early consultation between the Commander-in-Chief and the Committee ofImperial Defence, and if approval by the two Governments were given to an alteration of the plan after such consultation, some reconsideration of thestrength and composition of the forces might be required.287. We recommend that the proposed organisation and equipment of theair forces as explained in Chapter 7, Section 2, should be approved (para-graph 181).288. We recommend that the supply difficulty arising out of the longercycle of re-equipment adopted for Army Co-operation and Bomber transport aircraft should be investigated by the Defence Department in consultation withthe Air Minister at an early date (paragraph 175).289. We suggest that it should be confirmed that India&apos;s relatively smallrequirements of aircraft and engines in war can be met out of Air Ministryreserves (paragraph 177).Reorganisation of the Royal Indian Navy (Chapter 8).290. Our recommendations for the reorganisation of the Royal Indian Navyare set out in this Chapter. They are based on the agreement reached by theBritish and Indian Governments and announced in January 1938. Theprincipal recommendations to which we draw attention here are for theconstruction of four &quot; Bittern &quot; class escort vessels, the rearming of &quot; Indus &quot;and &quot; Hindustan &quot; and the completion of local naval defence measures. the detailed recommendations are summarised in paragraph 198.Coast Defence (Chapter 9). :,291. In addition to the provision of the two Bomber squadrons with adual role of Frontier duties and coast defence, we recommend the provision ofcoast defence and anti-aircraft artillery at the principal ports. We assume thatthe danger to the ports will probably disappear when commerce raiders have beenrounded up in the first few months of the war (paragraph 201) ; and we considerthat the provision of 6-inch guns on modern mountings should suffice to deterattempts to bombard the ports so long as the scale of attack is no higher thanthat of a cruiser or armed merchant vessel operating some thousands of milesfrom its base (paragraph 202). We recommend these measures as providing areasonable minimum insurance; and on that basis we do not propose that.2-inch guns, of which the cost would be very heavy, should be installed atBombay (paragraph 203). We recommend the provision of 3-inch anti-aircraft guns at the principal ports, and we assume that steps will be taken to ensurethe supply of the small number required from stocks available in the UnitedKingdom (paragraphs 209 and 210). We summarise our recommendations inparagraph 212.Ordnance Factories (Chapter 10).292. We discuss in this Chapter the proposals which were made by theGovernment of India to reorganise and expand their Ordnance Factories so asto make India as far as practicable self-sufficient in war in the supply ofmunitions. The policy underlying these proposals had already been consideredby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, who had advised its adoption.
293. We have examined the possibility of enlisting private enterprise toassist in the production of munitions in India, and we have also considered thealternative course to production in India of relying on purchase outside thecountry and the accumulation of large reserves.294. We recommend that the proposals of the defence authorities set outin paragraph 229 for the reorganisation and expansion of seven of the existingfactories and the construction of a new factory for the manufacture of T.N.T.should be adopted.295. We also recommend that consideration should be given to theco-ordination of these proposals with any similar plans that are contemplated in other parts of the Empire (paragraph 234).Finance (Chapter 11).296. The capital cost of our recommendations is necessarily extremelyconjectural, but on the most reliable estimates which are possible at the presenttime it will amount to over  30 millions. It does not appear to us that the funds to meet this expenditure can be found out of the resources at present availablein India (paragraph 250).297. If assistance could be given to India to enable her to meet the capital cost of reorganising and modernising her forces as we propose, it is estimatedthat the maintenance charges during the first five years after deducting theincreased annual contribution from His Majesty&apos;s Government of  2,000,000from the 1st April, 1939, would be within the level of the present provision for defence, provided no further improvements in the conditions of service of british forces were introduced which would involve a material increase of expenditure inIndia; and we see at present no reason why it should not be possible for Indiato remain self-supporting without any undue burden on her resources(paragraph 247).298. We regard it as axiomatic that with the help of such reasonablecontribution as His Majesty&apos;s Government may make towards the cost of India&apos;defence forces, so far as they are satisfying what we look upon as a joint responsibility of the two Governments, India should meet the whole maintenancecost of her forces out of her own resources (paragraph 248).(Signed) CHATFTELD.E.

APPENDIX II.[CP. 138 (39).]SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THECABINET COMMITTEE ON THE REPORT OOF THE expert committee ON THE DEFENCE OF INDIA.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.57. The conclusions and recommendations of the present Report may besummarised as follows :  (1) We are in agreement with principal conclusions which the ChatfieldCommittee have drawn, and with the principal recommendations which they have put forward for the re-organisation of India&apos;defence Forces; and we recommend the Cabinet to accept them(paragraph 101).The Principles on which the Re-organisation Proposals are based.(2) The first principle on which the re-organisation proposals are based isthat the responsibility for the Defence of India rests through theGovernor-General and the Secretary of State for India with theBritish Government; and that this responsibility will in no respect be weakened, whatever political pressure is brought to bear on theGovernment of India, either before or after the coming of Federation.We recommend that the Cabinet should make it clear that there willbe no departure from this fundamental principle (paragraph 12).(3) We also recommend the Cabinet to accept the second main principle onwhich the Chatfield Committee&apos;s re-organisation proposals are based,namely, the joint responsibility of the British and Indian Govern -ments for the external Defence of India (paragraphs 13 and 14).(4) We recommend that an assurance be conveyed to the Government of india that His Majesty&apos;s Government will support them in any measureswhich may become necessary in the event of a major political crisisoccurring in India as a result of the acceptance of the principle of joint responsibility (paragraph 14).(5) We endorse the Chatfield Committee&apos;s proposal for a comprehensive review of policy on the Western Frontier, but, pending the receipt ofa report from the Governor-General, which is expected at an earlydate, we can make no detailed recommendations as to how, and by whom, this review should be undertaken (paragraphs 15 to 19).The Military Aspects of the Proposals.The A rmy in India.(6) We submit for approval the detailed recommendations of the Chiefs ofStaff in connection with the Chatfield Committee&apos;s proposals for thestrength and distribution of the Army in India, including the external Defence Troops (paragraphs 23 to 26).(7) We submit for approval the detailed recommendations of the Chiefs ofStaff with regard to the British and Indian units declared surplusunder the Chatfield Committee&apos;s proposals. The Cabinet should be aware (a) that the whole of the British units declared surplus have left India and have been absorbed into the British establishment, and(b) that no disbandment of surplus Indian units will take place for afurther 12 months, the Government of India having accepted theirupkeep for this period as a charge on the Indian Defence Budget(paragraphs 27 to 30 and Annex),f The references in paragraph 57 are to earlier paragraphs in our present &quot;Report.
The Royal Air Force in India.(8) The Chatfield. Committee were unable to reach agreement as to thestrength of the air forces which should be maintained for I.ndia&apos;sLocal Defence requirements, and their financial appreciation is accordingly based on the strength recommended by the Commander-in-Chief in India. The Chiefs of Staff record the opinion that aminimum of two additional bomber squadrons is required for Local-Defence purposes, over and above the strength recommended by theCommander-in-Chief. The additional bomber squadrons could not inany event be supplied for some time, but we recommend that the Chiefsof Staff should give further consideration to this question in thecourse of their examination of the Indian War Plan (paragraph 31).(9) As regards the air forces which should be maintained in respect of the external Defence commitment, the allocation of two bomber squadronsrecommended in the Chatfield Report is regarded by the Chiefs ofStaff as not providing sufficiently for the air reinforcements requiredfor the Middle and Far East. We consider that the strength of thesereinforcements is a matter which the Secretary of State for Air should raise in the Committee of Imperial Defence (paragraphs 33 and 34).The Royal Indian Navy; the Coast Defence of India; the OrdnanceFactories.(10) We endorse the recommendations of the Chatfield Committee under theabove headings (paragraph 35).Finance.(11) Our inquiries confirm the view of the Chatfield Committee that it willnot be possible to raise any substantial amount of additional revenue for Defence purposes in India, during the period of re-equipment(paragraph 36).(12) Accordingly we see no alternative but to recommend that the capital costof the reorganisation proposals, estimated at  34-33 millions, shallbe provided by the Home Exchequer, stipulating at the same time thatany excess over the above figure will be borne by the Government ofIndia. Conclusion 17 below contains our recommendation on the extentto which this Home Exchequer assistance should be in the form of grant and loan respectively (paragraphs 37 and 38).(13) As regards maintenance charges, we agree with the Chatfield Committeein regarding it as axiomatic that, with the help of such reasonablecontribution as His Majesty&apos;s Government may make towards thecost of India&apos;s Defence Forces, so far as these are satisfying a joint responsibility, India should meet the whole maintenance cost of herforces out of her own resources. In our view there would be no case for further assistance from the Home Exchequer in respect of futuremaintenance charges resulting from the present reorganisationproposals; we would not, however, recommend that any hard and fastdecision of principle should be taken at the present time in respectof maintenance charges arising out of causes not directly connectedwith the proposed reorganisation, e.g., future improvements in theconditions of service of British troops in India (paragraphs 39 and 40).(14) The Government of India have informed us that they are prepared infuture, on the assumption that the Chatfield Report as a whole is accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, to meet the ordinarymaintenance charges which will arise in the event of the external defence troops being employed outside India in an emergency affectingIndia&apos;s external security (paragraph 41).(15) We submit for approval a proposed order of priority in the supply of warequipment and reserves, as between the Army at Home and the Armyin India (paragraphs 42 to 44).(16) We point out that exchange difficulties may occur in respect of purchases in America, e.g., of vehicles or machine tools (paragraph 45).
(17) We recommend that one-quarter of the sum of  34-33 millions, being. the estimated capital cost of the reorganisation proposals (see conclusion 12), should be advanced as a loan to India from the HomeExchequer, the remainder being a gift from His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. We consider that interest on the loan should be entirelyremitted during the first five years; and that after this period india should pay the service of the loan (interest and repayments of capital)out of her current resources (paragraphs 46 and 47).General.Co-ordination of Defence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of India.(18) We endorse the recommendations of the Chatfield Committee on theco-ordination of Defence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of India; and we note with satisfaction that a bodycorresponding to the Committee of Imperial Defence is being estab-lished in India (paragraphs 50 to 53).The Higher Direction of Indian Defence.(19) We suggest that we should be authorised to sit again for the purposeof reporting on the higher direction of Defence matters in India(paragraphs 54 to 56).Signed on behalf of the Committee:T. W. H. INSKIP, Chairman.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,June 23, 1939.
