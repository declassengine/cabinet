CABINET      48 (59).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet heldon SATURDAY,  2nd SEPTEMBER,  1939,  at 4.15 p.in.CONTENTS.Subject. Page.THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. 1.

THENATIONALSITUATION.(previous reference cabinet 47(39), Con-clusion 1.)1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that as he and $is-foreign secretary would have to make statements in Parliament very soon after the conclusion of the Cabinet, it would be a great-help if Sir Horace Wilson and Sir Alexander Cadogan,who would assist in drafting the statement could be present at -the Meeting of theCabinet.The Cabinet agreed to this  course,and Sir Horace Wilson and Sir Alex-ander Cadogan then entered theMeeting.THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he could best explain the position by readinga note which had been made of a telephone conversa-tion which he had had with Count Ciano and Sir PeroyLoraine.&quot;Count Ciano rang up Lord Halifax at 2.55p,m. to say that the Italian Government had informed the German Government that they stillthought it passible to call a conference with france, Great Britain and Poland, but thatthey must know first if Germany would be willing to accept.    The Italian Governmenthad not pressed the German Government, but had only informed them of their view.Sir Percy Loraine then came to the telephone and said that the Italian Government had instructed their Ambassador in Berlin thismorning to tell Herr von Ribbentrop purelyfor information and not as a proposal thatif Herr Hitler would suspend, hostilities and agree in principle to a conference on the lines proposed by the Duee, the Italian Governmentbelieved that Great Britain and France would participate and that Great Britain and france would, be able to bring Poland also.     TheItalian Ambassador had now reported that herr von Ribbentrop ha.d told, him that theFuhrer had taken note of the message, thathe would not be a.ga.ins t taking it into eon-sideration, but that he found himself in the - Npresence of two Notes, one English and oneFrench, of yesterday evening, the characterof which v/as not clear to him.    If theircharacter was that of an ultimatum, the Fuhrerwould take no proposal into consideration,and would naturally reply to the British andFrench Notes in a frankly negative sense.With Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;?3  consent theItaljts^&apos;Amb*eea^or-went immediately to see^$ir&quot;Nevile Henderson, who authorised him to&quot;&quot;declare that the British-Note of yesterdayevening did not have.-the character of an ultimatum. &quot;

The Foreign Secretary explained that Sir nevile henderson had been authorised to say that this message was not an ultime.turn, since we wanted himto refer hack to &quot;us on receiving the answer to it,in order that the time when we declared war might be arranged, in consultation with the French.&quot;Signor Attolico had informed Herr von ribbentrop accordingly, but the latterwished (a)  to have this confirmed throughRome and (b) to know whether Germany wouldhave time to consider the Duce&apos;s proposalfor example up to noon to-morrow.Sir Percy Loraine rear1 out over the telephone a further telegram from theItalian Ambassador in Berlin to the fol-low ing effe ct:&apos; I wish to make clear that the Fuhrerwas making ready to send a replythis corning to the British and FrenchNotes of yesterday evening, but thathe has not- done so and is not doing sopending receipt of the assurancessuggested, in my previous telegram.&apos;Count Oia.no then asked Sir Percy Loraineto let H.M.G. know that a. few minutes ago hehad telephoned to f. Bonnet explaining thesituation in the same way and had asked whatthe reply of the French Government was to herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s two points,   M. Eonnetsaid, that the French Government&apos;s reply to both points was affirmative.    Count. Cianowished to make clear to Lord Halifax that aconference in the view of the Italian Govern-ment  could only be summoned if there were animmediate armistice.Lord. Halifax said that he would at oncespeak to the Prime Minister, in view of thestatement just about to be made in Parlia-raent.   He felt, however, that the reaction of His Majesty s Government would be thatthe first step must be the withdrawal ofGerman troops from Polish soilc    Although hewas speaking personally, he felt sure that thatwould be the judgment of the British Cabinet.Sir Percy Loraine passed this on to Count Cie.no,who then said that he was afraid that thiswould be impossible, but that an armistice with a conference on the following day was,he thought, the maximum which the ItalianGovernment  could, get across Berlin,

Lord Halifax said that he would ring uplater in the afternoono      Count Ciano saidthat he was waiting for the French reply from M0 Daladier.      Count Ciano again saidthat he did not think it possible to obtainthe withdrawal of German troops, and lord halifax said that it would be very difficult for us to contemplate a conference with german troops on Polish soilo&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that, as a resultof the receipt of these messages, the statements whichthe Prime Minister and he had arranged to make in theHouses of Parliament had been postponed,.      immediately on receiving the message from Count Ciano he had returned to Ho. 10 Downing Street, and had had a conversation on the telephone with M. Bonnet.      He asked sir Alexander Cadogan to read to the Cabinet the Notehe had made of this conversation      The effect of this note was as follows:-M. Bonnet recalled a conversation he had had with Count Ciano0     Count Ciano thought that aconference, with Poland included in it, might stillbe possible but had enquired (l) whether the Notedelivered in Berlin the previous evening was of thenature of an ultimatum, and (2) whether theGerman Government would be allowed until midday,September 3rd, to reply.      As to (l), M. Bonnethad replied in the affirmative;    as to (2) he hadreserved his decision.      The Secretary of Statethen informed M. Bonnet that he had told count ciano, in reply to similar enquiries, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be likely to insist,as a first essential, on the withdrawal of german troops from Polish territory, a condition whichCount Ciano had thought it would be impossible forHerr Hitler to accept.      Mo Bonnet felt the same,. though he had agreed that insistence on this condition was highly desirable.      He (M. Bonnet)had added that, before embarking upon a war, itwas essential to convince public opinion that everypossibility of reaching a settlement had beenexplored^      The Secretary of State promised to letMo Bonnet have the final views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the questions at issue and on the time limit to be inserted in the eventual ultimatum.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, following on this conversation, he had had some discussion with the Prime Minister.    He thought it would help the Cabinet if he set out the conclusions which theyhad provisionally arrived at.    He had summarised these in the form of points to be made in the House of Commonst-first, that the communication which Sir nevile henderson had made to the German Government had beena final warning rather than an ultimatum.Secondly,  if the German Government asked forfurther time for consideration of their reply to ourcommunication, we should be prepared to allow them until 12 noon to-morrow for this purpose, subject totheir agreeing to an armistice.Thirdly, that the primary condition for anyconference would be that German troops should firstwithdraw from Polish soil.Fourthly, that while we still thought thatdirect negotiations between Poland and Germany would bethe best course, we were willing to see other Powersassociated in the discussions,  if this course was desired by the two countries.The Foreign Secretary added that he thoughtthat we might be prepared to consider an extension of thetime limit from 12 noon to-morrow to 12 midnight on 3rd/4th September, if this would facilitate considerationof a conference.In the discussion which ensued, it was generally agreed that it would be impossible to have any negotiations with Germany while German troopsremained on P0lish territory.

In this connection;, the PRIME MINISTERrecalled the words which had been used in the communication handed by our Ambassador to the GermanGovernment &quot;that unless the German Government areprepared to give His Majesty&apos;s Government satisfactory assurances that the German Government have suspendedall aggressive action against Poland and are preparedpromptly to withdraw their forces from Polishterritory. His&apos;Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom will without hesitation fulfil theitobligations to Poland&quot;0.After quoting this passage in the House ofCommons yesterday, he stated that he had described the document as a last warningsTHE HOME SECRETARY said that he thoughtthat this communication had been generally regardedas in the nature of an ultimatum, and that he.thought there would be tremendous risks in accepting any delaywhich might well have considerable reactions on public opinion,.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, in consideringthe hour to be fixed for the expiry of our ultimatum,,it should be borne in mind that, while he understoodthat the Chiefs of Staff were opposed to further delay,he had had a message from the French Government to theeffect that they did not want the ultimatum to expirefor another 48 hours.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that theChief of the Air Staff strongly opposed a further delay of 48 hours.    He understood that this view was basedpartly on purely military grounds,  and partly on the moral effect of redeeming our pledge to Poland with the&quot;minimum of delay,,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theNaval Staff did not attach very much importance to-5-

catching the Bremen.    On other grounds, however, they were opposed to any appreciable further delay and they were anxious tocarryout a reconnaissance to find out the latestposition of the German naval forces.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR said that theadvice given to him by the General Staff accorded with that given by the Chief of the Air Staff, although it should perhaps be stated that the Chiefs of Staff had not been aware of the proposals emanating from Count Ciano.    On the generalissue, he was strongly opposed to further delay which hethought might result in breaking the present unity in thecountry.    Public opinion here was strongly against ouryielding an inch.    If the Germans were prepared to considera standstill, it showed that they were weakening and thatwe should show the greatest possible strength,,    There wasalso the question that further delay might give units of theGerman Fleet some advantage.    Reports were also current of activities of Germans inside Poland.    He thought we should stand firmly on the statement which had been sent to theGerman Government on the previous night and insist on theimmediate withdrawal of German troops from.Poland.    He also thought it was likely that Italy was acting in collusion withGermany, and he instanced various troop movements which lentsupport for this view.    He therefore favoured giving Germanyuntil midnight 22B./ilt&amp; September to accept the proposal to with-drow her troops, otherwise we should regard ourselves as at war.The Dictators had made demand after demand and if we^were tohesitate now, we might well find ourselves faced with war ina year&apos;s time, but in the meantime we should have lostground by hesitation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR pointed out that,if Herr Hitler agreed to a standstill and to a withdrawal ofhis troops, it would mean a great loss of prestige andmight result in his downfall.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that itmust clearly he a condition of any conference that Herr Hitler agreed, not merely to an armistice hut to withdrawal of troops fromPolish soil.     He thought that there was noreason to believe that Herr Hitler would make concessions at the Conference if it tookplace.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADEraised the Question of Danzig, and said thatin addition to withdrawal from Polish soil,the status quo must be restored in Danzig.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was what he and the Foreign Secretary intended.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY of lancaster said that in any statement which wasmade it would be necessary to avoid putting forward proposals which involved an armistice,to be followed by a period in which arrangementsfor the Conference were discussed, beforeGerman troops had been withdrawn from Polishsoil.     He thought that any armistice mustbe followed immediately by withdrawal ofGerman troops from Polish soil.After some further discussion, THEPRIME MINISTER recapitulated the provisional conclusions which he and the Foreign secretary had reached as follows:    He said that they felt it was impossible to agree to Count Ciano&apos;suggestion that a Conference should take placewhile German troops were still on Polish soil,even If an armistice took place.     They had felt, and it waa clear that the Cabinet agreed,

that there should he no discussion of termsuntil Germany had left Polish soil.The second point was whether we should now say to Germany that she must indicate beforemidnight tonight her willingness to withdraw hertroops from Polish territory, and that, failingher acceptance, we should then declare war;   orwhether we should give Germany more time.Herr Hitler had asked that he might have untilIS noon tomorrow to consider the Duce&apos;s proposal.Under our suggestion there was no question of givingHcrr Hitler time to consider the Duce&apos;s proposal, sincewo insisted on acceptance by Germany of - the withdrawalof-German troops from. Polando     It was not very likely that Herr Hitler would accept this condition,and the point at issue was whether the time allowedhim to consider it should expire at midnight that night,at 12 noon tomorrow, or conceivably even later.In this connection, it was necessary to bear inmind that the French were asking for another 48 hours.Whatever conclusion was reached by the C binet that afternoon, it would be necessary to have further consultations with the French in order to agree our line of action with them.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that on military grounds he thought that itwas undesirable to allow Herr Hitler any longertime than until midnight September 2nd/3rd tomake up his mind.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies said that the Germans could make up their minds

;fiU LiX-c^tS s (a. ajlquickly enough   on occasions and had been known to ask other people to make up their minds in a very short time.7 He was opposed/  to allowing Herr Hitler any longer period thanuntil midnight on 2nd/3rd September.THE SECRETARY OR STATE POR AIR thoughtthat the communication to be made to theGerman Government should be to the effect thatif the German Government would indicate by 12midnight their willingness to withdraw their troops, we,, for our part, would be prepared toconsider a Conference of five Powers to considerthe questions at issue between Germany and Poland.In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he contemplated that,in the statement which he would have to make inthe House of Commons that afternoon, he would saythat we were not prepared to consider a Conferenceunless the German troops were withdrawn from Polishsoil.The question of the military situation in poland was then raised.     The Prime Minister readout a communication which had just been made tohim by the Polish Ambassador:-The Polish Ambassador has just calledand asked that the attached telegram which he has just received from hisGovernment should be communicatedimmediately to the Prime Minister.He was instructed by his Governmentto request the immediate fulfilment of British obligations to Poland andhe asked that he might have an urgent reply to his representation.- 9 -

The telegram referred to read as follows:-&quot;Battle to-day over the whole of thefront has increased in intensityand has acquired very seriouscharacter.     Our troops are opposingstrong resistance.     The whole ofGerman Air Force is engaged againstPoland.     Villages and factoriesbombarded.     The engagement ofGerman aircraft by allied forcesof greatest urgency.&quot;THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that the PolishAmbassador had spoken to him twice in the House ofCommons that afternoon to the effect that he wasvery disturbed at the attitude taken by M. Bonnetand at the delay in sending Germany an ultimatum.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR was against allowingGermany any further time to make fresh dispositionsby land or sea.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that each day, delay meant that the Poles werein a less favourable, and Germany in a more favourable,position.     If a Conference took place and Herr Hitlerdid not agree to reasonable terms, we should have lostvaluable time.     The effect on the morale of thecountry must also be considered.     From the military point of view there should be no delay beyondmidnight tonight.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSconcurred in the view that we should give Germany up&quot;to midnight tonight to decide whether she would withdraw her troops from Polish soil.- IP -

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought therewas generally agreement in the Cabinet on the two main points at issue.     First, that there should heno negotiation with Germany unless she was firstprepared to give an undertaking to withdraw hertroops from Poland and Danzig.     Secondly, that itwas undesirable to allow Germany longer than untilmidnight, 2nd/3rd September to make up her mind on. thosepoints.     A communication in this sense clearlyconstituted an ultimatum.     At the same time it was evident that the precise terms of the communication to be made to Germany and the statement to be madein Parliament that afternoon would, have to be settled in consultation with the French.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) To despatch a communication tothe German Government on the lines indicated in the discussion.(2) Authorise the Prime Minister, and foreign secretary to settle the terms ofthis communication, and of thestatrnents to be made in Parliamentthis afternoon, after consultationwith the French Government.Richmond Terrace, 3.W.I.,2nd September, 1939.
