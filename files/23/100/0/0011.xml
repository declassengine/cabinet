1,        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet wouldhave seen the telegrams from Sir Nevile Henderson(Nos.458 , 459, and)461 from Berlin) reporting the interviewflhich he had had with Herr Hitler,   He had thought itbrightthat the whole Cabinet should share the opportunity whichhe and the Foreign Secretary had had, of discussing thewhole position with Sir Nevile Henderson,After di scussi on with the Ambassador, theconclusion had been reached that it would be undesirable that we should send an answer to Herr Hitler that afternoon,since this might create the impression thatwe could he rushed.     It would be right that we shouldtake time to consider cur reply*    Before leaving BerlinSir Nevile had sent a note to Herr von Ribbentrop, to theeffect that discussion of the matter might take some timeand that it was by no means certain that he would he ableto return that night.     He had now sent a message to theeffect that the matter was being very carefully considered and that he hoped to return to Berlin some time tomorrowafternoon.     The Prime Minister said that he proposedlater in the Meeting to hand round to the Cabinet a draft reply.     He did not, however, suggest that the cabinet should reach any final decision on the draft that evening,but that they should meet again in the morning to considerthe matter finally before the Ambassador left for Berlinin the afternoon,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he felt sure that Sir Nevile Henderson would be willing to answer any questions which members of theCabinet wished to put to him.       Inform, Herr Hitler&apos;s

letter showed the not unfamiliar technique.       It was clearly one purpose of the letter to divide us ifpossible from the French and the Poles, and to try to make us realise that, in the new situation created by the Russo-German Pact, Poland&apos;s friends could do nothing to help her, and should therefore make no attemptto do -so.He thought that two conflicting desires were expressed in Herr Hitler&apos;s letter.     The first was his keen desire to settle the Polish question.     Thesecond, h s desire to avoid a quarrel with the BritishEmpire,     He referred more than once to the positionas it would exist when the Polish question had been settled, but he was careful not to say what kind of settlement he had in mind.     The Foreign secretary thought feat, on this matter, there ?/as some conflict between the written message and what Herr Hitler had said in conversation which might be evidence that hehad not quite made up his mind what form of settlementhe was prepared to accept.     The ultimate question was, of course, whether he wanted a settlement with poland on his own terms more than he wanted to avoidwar with Great Britain,     He (the Foreign Secretary)felt no confidence as to the answer to this question,In the course of the day, fairly precise information, from sources alleged to be reliable,had reached us to the effect that Germany intendedto march into Poland that night, or, according to laterreports, the next morning.     Every member of the cabinet could form as good a judgment as he could as to whetherthis was likely to happen.     He himself thought, however,

that for the German Government to arrange for our ambassador in Berlin to fly to this country with e .special ribssags ia a German, aeroplane was not consistent with such an intention.     Even if the matter was viewedin the most sinister light? and the object of Herr Hitler&apos;sletter was to get another peace offer on record, therewas no point in making such an offer and not affordingtime for a reply9       It might well be that the object in causing these reports to be circulated was to influence the substance of our reply, and to disposeus to concede what Herr Hitler wanted.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary referred to a message which he had received the previous night froma neutral person in touch with Field Marshal Goering,to the effect that our action of that day in signingthe AagloHPolish. Treaty was a dreadful action and was likely to precipitate a crisis0The Foreign Secretary said, in passing, that ithad been suggested to him that he should find an excuse for postponing signature.       He had felt that to do so would be to excite suspicion among our friends, and tomake the Germans feel that we were likely to give way to pressure.The Foreign Secretary said that other information was that the signature of the Polish Treaty had produced a considerable effect in Berlin, as showing our determination.       Perhaps, oiju a broad view, the effectof the signature of the Treaty at this juncture did not count much either way.

The Foreign Secretary said that the same neutralperson had asked him to send a message to Field MarshalG-peringo     A suitable message had been prepared and despatched and the neutral person had expressed himself asmuch gratified.The Foreign Secretary said that he had given a gooddeal of thought to the general line of the reply to theGerman Chancellor.    It would be necessary, he thought, onthe one hand to acknowledge the spirit in which the appealwas made and to say that we were anxious to see a peaceful settlement;    and on the other hand, that we had our obligations to Poland which we ware bound to honour.    the reply should point out that Herr Hitler2s letter did notexplain what basis of settlement of the polish questionhe had in mindo   We, for our part, hoped that the basisof settlement which he contemplated would be reasonable If asolution could be arrived at which had regard to Poland1svital interests, and was subject to an internationalguarantees    it would be one which we could recommend toPolando   For the rest, we might indicate that we woreprepared to give certain help in regard to the minorityquestion;      but that it was difficult for us to say muchin regard to other questions until we had more precise information..The Foreign Secretary said that he had seen theFrench and Polish Ambassadors on the previous day.   He had given them the gist of Herr Hitler&apos;s letter and of our proposed draft reply.   M. Corbin had said that the french had also received a communication from Herr Hitler, but insomewhat different terms.    Thus, the references to theBritish Empire were replaced by references to the Western Front&quot;and to Alsace-Lorraine.    The Polish Ambassador had

expressed no special views.   The French had &quot;been willing tosuggest to the Polish Government that they should make adirect approach to Berlin in regard to an exchange of popqi3.atipn *He understood that Sir Nevile Henderson thought that thiswould he useful.Sir Nevile Henderson then replied to questions put tohim by various members of the Cabinet.   Asked whether he considered that Herr Hitler still entertained any doubts onthe point that, if he invaded Poland, Great Britain wouldmake war upon Germany, Sir Nevile replied that no reasonableperson could now have any doubt on the subject.    He thoughtthat in making the proposals in his letter, Herr Hitlerprobably had in mind;    first, the Prime Minister&apos;s letter;and secondly, the almost unanimous vote in the House ofCommons.   Since that morning he was probably also influenced by the signature of the Anglo^Polish Treaty.    He thoughthowever that we must not rule out altogether the possibility that Herr Hitler might still hope that he could detach us fromthe Poles and get us to dishonour our obligations.Asked whether he&quot;thought that the letter representedan attempt to find a way out, Qiv Nevile said that he thoughtthat the letter might have been written partly with a viewto providing useful material for propaganda.    Thus, itmight enable Herr Hitler to say that he had made a magnificentoffer to this country, which had been rejected.     The german propaganda in regard to encirclement, which had been runningwith great effect fOr some three or four months, was not nowjsince the conclusion of the Russo-German alliance, as con-vincing as it had been and he might feel theneed of propaganda on other lines? Another

possibility was that Herr Hitler had never intended to push matter beyond the limits of bluff, and that hethought it was now time to look for a solution of thedifficulty without war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the points made in the letter had, he thought, been in HerrHitier&apos;s mind continuously, and had made theirappearance at intervals.      The basic idea was thatif Britain would leave Herr Hitler alone in his Sphere,(Eastern Europe), he would leave us alone.      His ideamight be that he was now getting near war, and thatif war came, his people would say that it was his ownfault, and that accordingly he ought to state hispoints more clearly than ever before.      If the offer was rejected no doubt It would be represented for propaganda purposes as having been a magnificent offer.All the time there might be at the back of his mind the idea that he might be able to persuade usto accept some solution of the Danzig and Corridorquestions and that he would thus get his own way withoutwar.SIR NEVILE HENDERSON agreed.     Herr Hitler had said to him at Berchtesgaden that he would prefer to gethis way without war.In reply to another question the Ambassadorsuggested that, however little faith one might have in Herr Hitler&apos;s promises, one might at least testthem out.Asked what was the least which Herr Hitler would accept without going to war, Sir Nevile Henderson saidthat Herr Hitler would claim that Danzig should be incorporated in East Prussia.     He would also

wish to include the whole of the Corridor in Germany,out he might, perhaps, he content with extra-territorial roads.    At the present time, however, themost pressing question was the minority question;    thistook precedence over Danzig and the Corridor, thesolution of which might perhaps he postponed.    IierrHitler claimed that there were 1-g- million Germans in poland.    The Poles said there were a million Poles inGermany, but Herr Hitler said there were 600,000,Asked as to the allegations regarding thepersecution of the German minority, Sir nevile henderson thought that 80^ of the reports now publishedwere an exaggeration, but that the remaining 20% weretrue.    The reports of minority troubles could for a time be kept out of the papers, but he doubted whether, without some drastic change, the question could ever be permanentlysettled.   As an example of the exaggeration of minorityquestions,    Herr   Hitler said    that there were 100,000persons of German race, but of Polish nationality, whowere now refugees in Germany.    The Polish Ambassadorsaid there were not more than 17,000 refugees^,Asked what advice the German General Staff had given Herr Hitler, Sir Nevile Henderson said that herr Hitler&apos;s military advisers would no.doubt favourwar with Poland alone.    If however it was clear thatGermany would thereby be involved, in a general war, hethought that the advice of the Gentian Generals wouldbe divided.    He agreed that the pact with Russia wasno doubt partly due to the influence of the Army, whosehistoric policy was an alliance between Germany and russia, and that the military probably enjoyed moreinfluence with Herr Hitler than any other section ofGerman opinion.

As regards the Russo-German alliance Sir Neviledoubted whether this had gone very far at the moment.Pw example he doubted whether there was any agreement to partition Poland.     At the same time it seemed likely that there was some big quid pro quo which did not form part of the published agreement.Sir Nevile Henderson mentioned that, when herr hitler had said to him that if general war broke outJapan would be the only gainer, he was probably influenced by the fact that just before his interview the japanese ambassador had protested strongly against the Russo-German alliance.     This had irritated Herr Hitler,who was a man of moods, and had caused him to make this statement.     He thought that there was a good deal ofindignation among the German people against the Russo-German alliance.     His own butler (a German) had saidto him with indignation that Germany had made anagreement with her one enemy.     Combined with this,however, there was a general sense of relief that thedanger of attack from the Russian Air Force waseliminated.     There was nothing in Berlin today tyindicate the likelihood of war.     He did not think,however, that if war broke out Herr Hitler wouldexperience any particular difficulty with his own people, at any rate for some time.     Nor did he thinkthat the Russo-German alliance would be likely to causeHerr Hitler difficulty, since the German people were soeasily led,A question was then asked as to what was the point at which Herr Hitler would fight, if his demands were notacceded to.Sir Nevile Henderson replied that he thought thatall along Herr Hitler had intended to start a war of nerves,and to see how much he could get without fighting.

9 &quot;7 5At the same time, if we got into a position inwhich neither side could give way, war would result.%t was, of course, particularly difficult forDictators to give way.Reference was made to the passage in Sir nevile henderson&apos;s telegram No. 459 which reported herr hitler as saying that he had no interest in makingGreat Britain break her word to Poland, and had no wishto be small-minded in any settlement with Poland.!i . SIR NEVILE HENDERSON said that there was an interesting point about this statement.     He had norecollection of Herr Hitler having used theseprecise words.     Subsequent to the interview,Herr Schmidt, the interpreter, who had been presenthad come to him and had given him various messages fromHerr von Ribbentrop, and had specifically drawn his attention to the fact that Herr Hitler had used thesewqrds.     He thought that it might well be the case thatijhese words were an addition to what had actually been said, and in effect formed a message from Herr von ribbentrop.It was agreed that this gave added significanceto these words.Reference was also made to the statement of herr Hitler, reported in telegram No. 462, that what-ever happened now, the fate of Poland world be settledbetween Germany and Russia,       It was explained thatthis statement had not been made as indicating any

intention on the part of Germany and russia to partition Poland, but rather as a general indication  that Germany was now so powerfulthat she could do what she wished.Asked whether it would be possible forHerr Hitler and Colonel Beck to negotiate amicablyat the present time, SIR NEVILE HENDERSON said hethought that this was so, though much depended onthe atmosphere.     He had told the Polish ambassador in Germany to see Field Marshal Goering, and totell him that Herr von Ribbentrop had ruined thelast negotiations between Poland and Germany.   he gathered that Herr von Ribbentrop had attemptedon that occasion to impose a diktat.     He hopedthat matters would be so arranged that, if nego-tiations started between Germany and Poland, therewOuld be no attempt at a German diktat.     sir nevile thought that the real value of our guarantee to Poland was to enable Poland to come to a negotiated settlement with Germany.There had been a good deal of talk of the demilitarisation of Danzig.     Herr Hitler had spoken of Danzig as a Free City, but Sir Nevile did not know what this was intended to convey.     It was true that Kerr Hitler had said that he would notrepeat the offer which he had made in March, but sir nevile thought that if something was done about the minority question Herr Hitler might still be per-persuaded to accept the offer which he had then made

in regard to Danzig and the Corridor.     the minority question was no new one, hut propaganda in regard to it had been shut down as the resultof the arrangement made between Marshal Pilsudskiand Herr Hitler in 1934.In reply to another question, Sir nevile henderson said that the general position was&quot;quite different from last year, when Herr hitler had entertained a great hatred of Dr. Benes andrefused to meet him.     He was quite well disposed towards Colonel Beck and M. Lipski.Reference was made to the Commissionswhich had been established in Czechoslovakia afterthe Munich settlement, and to the very stiffattitude which the German Government r*epresen-tatives had adopted on those Commissions,.     Askedwhether, if similar Commissions were now to beestablished to deal with German-Polish questions,the German attitude was likely to stiffen again,Sir Nevile Henderson said that there could be no guarantee that this would not happen..Reference was then made to the difficultyof opening direct negotiations between Poland andGermany, and to the difficult position which anyPolish negotiator sent to Germany would occupy.SIR NEVILE HENDERSON said that the PolishAmbassador in Berlin had seen no representativeof the German Government for the last four monthsuntil he had seen Field Marshal Goering quiterecently.     He had often advised himto see repre-sentatives of the German Government, but M*. Lipski

OOf 1d* 0 1had&quot; replied that he had nothing to say.     Hethought that the exchange of populations would hea favotirable point on which to open negotiations.Sir Nevile Henderson was asked whether hethought that the opening of direct negotiations between Poland and Germany would constitixte thegesture, referred to in telegram No, 459, whichmight avoid war,He replied that Herr Hitler&apos;s argumentwas that Britain had given a blank cheque to poland and that we had encoiiraged her to adopta thoroughly unreasonable attitude&amp;     If he wasin a position to say that we could arrange that thePolish Government wou.id enter into direct negotia-tions with Herr Hitler,  it might well make a con-siderable difference.In reply to a question as to what attitudethe Polish Government would take towards an exchange of populations, THE SECRETARY OP STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he had put this point tothe Polish Ambassador, who had not reacted unfavour-ably to it.     He had given the impression that hewould be glad to find a way out of the  yresentdifficulties, hat doubted whether one co^ild befoundoGeneral agreement was expressed with the viewthat the minority question formed a good basis on which to start negotiations.     It was pointedout that in negotiating an exchange of populations,each country could treat on level terms with theother, and that there need be no question of one country giving way to the other0

9 Q ^tji (j t-jIn further discussion it was suggested that itwould he desirable in the reply to Herr Hitler to takeadvantage of the phrase to which Herr Schmidt had drawnparticular attention, namely, that Herr Hitler had no interest inmaking Britain break h.r word, and had no wish to he email-minded in any settlement with PolandoSIR 3MVILS HENDERSON agreed, and said that he had referred to this phrase in a note which he had sent to herr von Ribbentrop that afternoon.It was also pointed out that disarmament was referredto in more definite terms in herr hitler&apos;s letter than on previous occasions.SIR NEVILE HENDERSON said that Herr Hitler had mentioned that he had read the Prime Minister1s and foreign secretary&apos;s recent speeches.At this stage the draft reply to Herr Hitler&apos;s letter was handed round to the Cabinet, and was read out by thePrime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER invited suggestions as to thedraft.     He said that he would be very glad to know whatimpression it made on those of his colleagues who, unlikehimself, came to it fresh.     In discussion the following suggestions were made.It was suggested that the tone of the openingparagraphs was somewhat too deferential, and appearedto treat Herr Hitler&apos;s suggestions with somewhat too muchrespect.   Generally, it was thought that the earlier partof the draft might be stiffened up.       A letter which wasfirm yet moderate in tone might have great effect on german public opinion.

It was also suggested that more prominence should .he given in the earlier part of the draft to our undertaking to Poland.     Again, it was thought that thedraft did not make enough of the need for direct negotiation on the minority question and proposed exchangeof populations-between Poland and Germany0In reply to this the FOREIGN SECRETARY said thatthis had been done deliberately, as in Sir Nevile Henderson&apos;view if this proposal was to have any chance of acceptanceit should come from the Polish Government.     The cabinet were informed that acting with the French, we had endeavoured in the course of the day to persuade theFrench to induce them to make a move in this direction.The question was raised whether it was intendedto consult the Poles before despatching our reply.   Itwas felt that this would lead to delay, and might put the Poles in a difficult position.   Colonel Beck mightbe unwilling to give a definite answer.    It was generally felt that we must take the responsibility for what was said in the letter, although this would pi ace limits   on what we could say.Two alterations to the order of paragraphs inthe letter were suggested.      The first was that paragraph3 suitably amended should be brought down after theend of paragraph 5.    The other was that paragraph 6broke the continuity of the argument represented byparagraphs 4, 5 and 7, and that it should come later on, perhaps after paragraph 9o

Reference was also made to the statement inparagraph 3 of the draft letter that Eis Majesty&apos;aGovernment would he prepared to accept the proposals outlined in the Fuehrer&apos;s offer, possibly with someadditions, as a basis of negotiation.    It was pointedout that one of these proposals concerned herr hitler*6Colonial demands and that it was undesirable to uselanguage which might be interpreted as implying thatwe accepted such a demand as a basis for negotiation.It wae suggested that the words &quot;subject fordiscussion&quot; might be substituted for the words &quot;basis for negotiation&quot;, and perhaps some less definite top!for &quot;acaepted&quot;.It was also suggested that it would be desirableto modify, the draft in such a way as to suggest thatwe appreciated the urgency of reaching a settlement ofsome, at least, of the problems involved, in order tolessen the :,existing state of tension.It was also suggested that it was undesirable to use the phrase &quot;general lines of an offer&quot; inparagraph 2.\Reference was made to the language of paragraph, dealing with minorities.    It was thought that thisparagraph, in particular the concluding section,referred to minority problems in terms of too greatmutuality, and that this was likely to arouse resent-ment on the part of Herr Hitler.    The view was also expressed that it was undesirable to give theimpression that we were lecturing Poland in this matter.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed his gratitude to his colleagues for their criticisms.It was agreed that the Prime Minister,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the

Chancellor4 of the Exchequer should he invited toprepare a revised draft, which would he consideredby the Cabinet at a meeting to be held at 10.30 a.m.on Sunday, 27th August,      It was agreed that copiesof the revised draft should be available to themembers of the Cabinet at 10.0 a.m.S in the TreasuryBoard Room.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSAttitude of        gave an account of the attitude of the Dominionsthe Dominions.and their High Commissioners.      The prime Minister ofAustralia and the Acting Prime Minister of NewZealand had both indicated their support of theattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government.     Mr. mackenzie king had said that he could make no public statement untilParliament reassembledy. but that if we were involve! in war,his Cabinet is uranimous in its decision to fight, As regardsSouth Africa, General Smuts said that he thought that circumstances would be too strong for $ nesal     &apos;Hertzog, and that he would have to summon Parliament,in which case he (General.Smuts) would press for adefinite decision between belligerency or neutralityand hoped to be able to carry his colleagues with him in deciding for belligerency.The Secretary of State said that in the courseof the day he had seen the High Commissioners, who,subject to one or two minor points, had taken the viewthat notwithstanding certain impertinenoe s in Herr Hitler&apos;note we   should send a reply to it in as generous terrasas possible.at The time of the Cabinet Meeting was subsequentlypostponed until 3.0   p0m,

Mr. te (/ater had thought that hisGovernment would favour making an effort tosecure a comprehensive settlement.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs then read out a telegram which &quot;the Union HighCommissioner   had just received from General Hertzog,and had shown to him.Broadly, the gist of the attitude of theHigh Commissioners was that we should make use of herr Hitler*s letter to endeavour to secure a discussion of what we should regard as a reasonable all round. All the High Commissioners were inagreement with this view, and had asked that thePrime Minister should he informed of what they had said.     Mr. Massey had, however, made it clear thathe was only expressing his personal views.The Cabinet took note of  this  statement.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINIONAFFAIRS also referred to a proposal by Mr. mackenzie king that H.M. the KING should be invited to send a letter to Herr Hitler.     This suggestion met with no favour.

DEFENCE 2.      Discussion took place in regard to aMEASURES. onumber ox defence measures.Suggestedintroduction The Cabinet were informed of a suggestion of the precautionary that it might be desirable to introduce the stage.Precautionary Stage,, subject to a proviso thatany measures which.could be regarded as of aprovocative character should not be sanctioned,and that no undue publicity should be given toany further steps taken.The view generally expressed was that departments had already, subject to perhaps a few exceptions, given effect to the steps which they regarded as necessary,  in present circumstances,and that it was undesirable to put the PrecautionaryStage into operation at this juncture.It was true that the War Book had been drawn up on the assumption that effect could bemore easily given to pre-arranged war measuresif the Precautionary Stage were formallyinstituted, since this provided the signal for the wholesale institution of a number of measuressimultaneously.

general grounds, to take this step.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCEreferred to an important Report which had beenprepared by the Chiefs of Staff (CCS.  966) dealingwith the preparation of a Declaration of War.    Themain points which emerged from this Report were thatif an ultimatum was not to be issued until all essential war preparations had been completed, the earliest date for the ultimatum would be Thursday, 31st August.    Thisassumed that action was taken which enabled evacuationto start by Monday the 28th.Army THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that heMobilisation.was prepared to accept the Prime Minister&apos;s decision that the time had not come for the mobilisation of theRegular Army Reserve.    He was, however, very anxious to embody the Territorial Field Army, further personnel tromwhich were urgently required for specific duties.In discussion, it was pointed out-that thiswould mean the embodiment of 300,000 men.In the course of discussion the PRIME MIMSf^Hsuggested that the Secretary of State for War should beauthorised to call for a further 35,000 men of theTerritorial Army, as volunteers, to carry out thevarious duties for which further personnel were immediately required.Postal and This course was agreed to.telegraph censorship.
