I.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinetmet under the gravest possible conditions.      Theevent against which we had fought so long and soearnestly had come upon us.     But our conscienceswere clear, and there should be no possible questionnow where our duty lay*THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the position was still confused in many respects, but the main lines were clear.     In thelast two days the principal obstacle to progress hadbeen the difficulty of establishing contact betweenthe Germans and the Poles.     On the previous nighta telegram had been sent to the Polish Governmentsaying that we hoped that they would instruct their^Ambassador in Berlin to see Herr von Ribbentrop.      Itwas not quite clear what action had actually beentaken, though it appeared that Herr von Ribbentrophad sent for Mo LipskicAll this, however, was rather ancienthistory.      The Cabinet would now have seen theannouncement of the German Government which had appeared in the Press that morning.     Since then,reports had been received of the invasion of Poland.The Cabinet would also have seen a copy of herr hitler&apos;s proclamation,   and also of Herr Flarster^proclamation announcing the annexation of Danzig tothe Reich,The Polish Ambassador had called to see theForeign Secretary that morning, and had said that hehad had information that German troops had crossed thefrontier at a number of places.     There were alsoreports of the bombing of various Polish towns.   He(the Polish Ambassador) had expressed the opinion- 1 -

that circumstances had arisen v/hich called for the implementation of our guaranteeo      He (the foreign secretary) had replied that, provided the facts were as stated, he did not suppose that we should differ from the Polish Ambassador&apos;s conclusionoThe Foreign Secretary said that he had thenrung up the German Charge d&apos;Affaires and told him of the reports which had been received, namely, thatthe German troops had crossed the frontier, and of the bombing of Polish towns,     He had asked the GermanCharge d!Affaires whether he had any information to convey to the Foreign Secretary, or any message fromthe German Government,     He had added that the situationappeared to be a very serious one;    that the cabinet would be meeting shortly;    and that any further communication would be made by Sir Nevile Hendersonto the German Government, and the German Charged&apos;Affaires informed.The German Charge d&apos;Affaires had rung up a quarter of an hour ago saying that he had had a message from the News Department in Berlin that it was nottrue that Warsaw and other cities had been bombed.He had. also referred to an observation in Herr Hitler1sspeech to the effect that there was shooting going onfrom the Polish side and that they (the Germans) wereshooting back.The Foreign Secretary also informed theCabinet of a telephone message he had received fromthe American Ambassador in London to the effect thathe had had a telegram in regard to the bombing ofWarsaw, and indicating great satisfaction with our attitude.

Later in the meeting, various messages wereread out, which appeared to indicate that the reportsof the bombing of Warsaw, at any rate, were premature.The Foreign Secretary also referred to twoconversations which he had had with Count Giano onthe previous day, although these were now of perhapshistorical interest only.     The first message had beenthat Signor Mussolini v/as very anxious to help, butwanted some new fact on which to approach the Fiihrer.He had asked whether the Poles were willing to say thatthey would agree to the return of Danzig to the Eeichand to negotiate on other matters.     After speaking tothe Prime Minister, he (the Foreign Secretary) loadreplied that Danzig was the kernel of the matter, andthat he did not feel that it would be possible to make anyprogress on the basis suggested.   As he saw the matter, thereal point v/as to get the German Government to agreeto negotiations.Count Ciano had then rung up a second time andhad proposed that a general Conference should be heldon the 4th September to discuss all questions arisingout of the Treaty of Versailles which gave rise to difficulties.     This matter had been discussed v/ith theFrench Government, and it had been agreed that, while itv/ould be impossible to accept the idea of negotiationunder an open threat of force, it v/as undesirable to showany unwillingness to agree to negotiations under morefavourable conditions.     Tills suggestion had howeverthen been overtaken by the course of events.The Foreign Secretary also read out to hiscolleagues telegram Ho. 737 from Rome, in which sir percy Loraine recorded a statement made by Count Ciano,under the seal of secrecy, as to Italy&apos;s attitude.       __

In the course of discussion, it was pointed outthat was at present no very definite information asto what hostile action had taken place in Poland and that it was desirable not to take any irrevocable action until wehad some greater assurance on this pointo    It waspointed out that Herr Hitler was at present making a speech which was being broadcast and further particulars of this speech would be available before the end of theCabinet meeting.    A telegram had also been received fromSir Nevile Henderson indicating that after Herr Hitler&apos;sspeech in the Reichstag there might be some furtherpeace effort on Herr Hitler&apos;s part.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at a later stage in the proceedings it would be necessary to consider theterms of the communication to be sent to the GermanGovernment.    He thought that it would be convenient ifthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence could at thisstage give the Cabinet the views of the Chiefs of staff as to whether it was desirable that this communication,should contain a time limit.THE MINISTER POR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that he had discussed this matter very brieflybefore the meeting of the Cabinet with his Servicecolleague b, the Lord Privy Seal and the Chiefs of Staff.The process of evacuation of the civil population had just started, and, looking at the matter from that point of view, it was obviously desirable that thereshould be a further delay before we sent a communicationin the nature of an ultimatum.   Apart from this point,which was not of determining importance, the general view of the Chiefs of Staff was set out in a paper(CCS. 966 Revise) which they had prepared a few days

previously.    Broadly, their view was that, once an ultimatum had been despatched, immediate action mightbe taken by the potential enemy.    In principle, therefore,the period between the despatch and the expiry of the ultimatum, which was one of uncertainty, should be asshort as possible.The Foreign Office representative had thoughtthat the period should be not less than 6 hours. In 1914the periodhad been 4 hours.  In the view of the Chiefs of Staff ,from the air point of view, it was desirable, if an ultimatum witha time limit was despatched,  that the ultimatum shouldexpire at midnight, although from the Naval point ofview this was not an ideal arrangement.The Chiefs of Staff had also considered whether there was any particular advantage in delaybefore the issue of an ultimatum.    Their general feeling had been that, if we reached the conclusion that circumstances had arisen in which we were bound to implement our guarantee, the right course would be thatwe should despatch to Germany a communication in thenature of an ultimatum without any undue delay.At this point the Cabinet adjourned discussionof the nature of the communication to be sent to theGerman Government, and considered various Defence Measures(See Conclusion 2 below).Later the Cabinet resumed discussion of the communication to be made to the German Government,Copies of a draft prepared were circulated to theCabinet.The question was asked whether the information which had been received as to hostile actions was sufficiently definite to justify the despatch of a communication on the lines of the draft.    TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs read extracts

from Herr Hitler&apos;s speech, which made it clear that onHerr Hitler&apos;s own statement Germany v/as now invadingPoland.The Foreign Secretary proposed the followingalteration of the final sentence in the draftcommunication, which read:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly notify the German Government that unless they canimmediately satisfy His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat these reports are unfounded, or, inthe alternative, are prepared to give his Majesty&apos;s Government satisfactory assurances that aggression against Polandhas been stopped and that the German troops will be promptly withdrawn from Poland,His Majesty&apos;s Government will withouthesitation fulfil their obligations to poland.&quot;This amendment met with general approval.The Foreign Secretary added that he hadreceived a communication from the French Government tothe effect that they wished to declare war before we did.    The reason given for this was said to be publicopinion in France, since the French Government were anxious not to appear to be dragged into war by us.It was agreed that while the French might reasonably claim that we should not declare war before they did, the right course would be that the French and ourselves should declare war at the same time.Some discussion ensued whether the draft shouldbe amended to state specifically that we had been invited by the Poles to fulfil our guarantee to thenwThe general feeling was that an amendment in this sensewas unnecessary and would not be an improvement.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then read to his colleagues a message which had been receivedby Sir Alexander Cadogan from Mr. D----. , speakingfrom Berlin.    The message was to the effect that1 he

supposed that we had heard that fighting had brokenout, and that, according to the information in Berlin,this had resulted from the Boles having blown up abridge.    Herr Hitler had declared that he did not want to start a world war, and wanted direct negotiationswith Great Britain.Mr. D.v.suggested that he should fly back atonce from Berlin with Sir G. Ogilvie-Porbes as a lastminute attempt to avert the catastrophe.    Mr. D....had said that we would ring up again at 1,15.After discussion, it was agreed that the replyto be sent by telephone to Mr. D.... should be stiff,and should stress the fact that the only way in which a world war could be stopped would be if the German troopsleft Polish territory and hostilities were suspended.Ho hope should be held out that we should act as mediatorsbetween Germany and Poland.The question whether a time limit should beinserted in the communication to Germany was againreferred to.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that it waspossible that the Germans might take aggressive actionon the receipt of this telegram.    Although it was unlikely that they would start an air attack on thiscountry, they might start an attack on our merchantshipping and ships of war.It was pointed out that it was important toascertain the French attitude in regard to this matter.The view generally held was that the insertion of a time limit gave a false sense of security, and should be omitted.    The real question at issue was when the draft telegram should be despatched.    On this we should actin consultation with the French Government.

The question was raised whether it was possibleto avoid a formal declaration of war, in view of the UnitedStates of America&apos;s probable attitude under the NeutralityAct.    It was agreed that this point should be borne inmind, but the view generally held was that a declarationof war. was the right course.THE PRIME MINISTER proposed, and the cabinet agreed, that the communication as amended should be sentoff as soon as agreement had been reached with the French.It was desirable that the despatch of the telegram shouldtake place at about 5 p.m. , in order that the fact thata communication had been despatched should be announced in Parliament.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs proposed, and it was agreed, that he should be authorisedto inform the Dominions in regard to the despatch of this communication to the German Government.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when the communication was sent to the German Government he thoughtour Ambassador should have instructions firstly to askwhen he might expect to receive a reply, and secondly, ifthe reply was unfavourable, whether he should then ask forhis passport.    The view was expressed that our ambassador should be instructed to ask for a reply, but that thequestion of the procedure to be adopted in this matter wasone for discussion with the French governments the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretarywere authorised to take such action as they thought fit in this matter,-8-

DEFENCE 2. THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence measures.said that at   a   meeting of the Defence PreparednessCommittee summoned very hurriedly that morningDepartments had been authorised to put the PrecautionaryStage into force, subject to one or two matters whichhad been reserved for decision by the Cabinet.Mobilization  Decisions taken that morning included the completionMeasures.of the mobilization of the whole of the Army (includingthe Territorial Array) and the Royal Air Force by proclamation and of the Royal Navy with the exceptionof the Royal Naval Special Reserve.       These steps would be implemented and the necessary Orders inCouncil would be approved at a meeting of the privy council to be held that morning.One of the main points to be settled was whetherthe warning telegram sent out on the institution of warning the Precautionary Stage should include Germans&apos;- only.Telegram.Reference to     or Germany and Italy, as potential enemies.     ThisItaly.matter was to some extent affected by the telegram fromSir Percy Lo^aine which the Foreign Secretary had just read.The Cabinet were informed that telegrams hadbeen sent to all Commanders-in-Chief abroad as to theaction which they should take in the event of thereceipt of a warning telegram specifying both Germanyand Italy as potential enemies.      The view v/as expressed by the Foreign Secretary and the HomeSecretary that it was desirable not to stopprecautionary measures in the Mediterranean,

At the same time, it was felt that it would he desirableto avoid any action which would be regarded as undulyprovocative to Italy,      In particular, it would be undesirable to take drastic action in regard to people of Italian nationality in Colonies such asMalta,  although it was appreciated that there mightbe particular instances of persons of Italiannationality employed in vulnerable points where some action might be required.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed thatthe warning telegram should include both Germanyand Italy as potential enemies, on the basis thatwhile Germany was specified as an enemy without qualification, it should be explained that Italy1sposition was not yet publicly defined;    that it seemed likely that her position would he one of neutrality   and while it was necessary to guard against possible surprise attach, action should not beembarked on which would be regarded as undulyprovocative, such .as, for example, the internment of civilians, except in special cases.THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR DOMINION affairs thought it would be necessary to inform the DominionGovernments of the gist of Sir Percy Lorainefstelegram No. 737 from Rome.     It was agreed that thisshould be done.Defence of It was agreed that the second stage the Suez Canal.of the Suez Canal Defence Plan should be put intooperation.Institution After hearing a statement from the Chancellorof Food Control.of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Cabinet authorised theChancellor to take the following steps:-

(i)    To constitute and set up Pood Control Committees.(ii)    To take over the control of the distributionof staple commodities.(iii)    To decentralise Smithfield and Billingsgate.(iv)    To issue orders fixing maximum prices for a number of important commodities.With regard to the last item, the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster pointed out that the ProvisionExchanges would probably pass a stand-still Resolutionthat afternoon, as they had done in the previous Septemberif he invited them to do so.     He proposed to invite themto act in this way.Issue of Broad- The importance was emphasised of keeping broad-cast Messageand. Control of casting going on the widest possible basis as long asRadioTransmission,   possible.      On the other hand., it was felt that it wouldbe undesirable to run the risk of delaying synchronisationafter we had made a communication to Germany in the natureof an ultimatum.The Cabinet agreed to confirm the decisionalready taken by the Defence PreparednessCommittee at their Second Meeting, by whichthe Secretary of State for Air had been authorised to order synchronisation when he considered that this was necessary, inconsultation with the Lord Privy Seal.Advanced Air It was agreed that steps should be taken to sendStriking Force.the Advanced Air Striking Force to France forthwith.The first It was agreed that arrangements should be made forcontingentof the the first contingent of the Field Force to proceed toField Force.France forthwith.     Ho announcement should of course bemade in regard to either of these measures.Brief references were made to a number of other measures, such as the establishment of a Ministry ofEconomic Warfare, the institution of coal control and offood contx^ol and motor spirit rationing, which were ready to be put into operation imniiediately after theoutbreak of war.

Evacuation.Meeting ofParliamentand EmergencyBills.sSee note on nextpage.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether it waspossible to expedite the process of evacuation.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL explained that theevacuation scheme had been very carefully organised and that there was no alternative between adhering tothe arrangements which had been made or allowingpeople to proceed in a wholly unorganised way.The Cabinet took note of thisstatementsTHE PRIME MINISTER said that arrangements had been made for Parliament to meet at 6 p.m, that evening.     He was proposing to arrange for thepublication forthwith of the correspondence which hadtaken place with the German and Polish Governments.In particular, he wanted to bring out the point thatwhile the Polish Government had been prepared toagree to our proposal for a military standstill, theGerman Government had made no answer on this point.The Prime Minister said it was also proposed .to ask Parliament to pass about seventeen EmergencyBills through all their stages that evening.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explainedthat the procedure proposed was to table an EmergencyResolution, and, as a first step, to pass a Vote of credit for  500 millions.     This would be followed bythe Consolidated Fund Bill.The second part of the Emergency Resolutionwould be framed with a view to passing the othersixteen Emergency Bills which were regarded as of first priority, and which should be passed into law beforethe outbreak of hostilities.The Chancellor pointed out that this listof Bills included the Compensation Bill.35   He thoughtthat it might possibly be found necessary to deferthis Bill until the ensuing day.The Cabinet agreed to the procedureproposal,- 12

Bank Holiday THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said and exchange control. that the view now held was that it would he desirable that the Bank holiday, which it was planned to declare on the outbreak of war, shouldbe on Monday, the 4th September,     This decision was dependent upon the date on which the exchange control Regulations were made.The Chancellor explained that no freshlegislative authority was required for either ofthese two measuresoThe Cabinet authorised the Chancellorof the Exchequer to ta3.ce the necessary action in regard to these two matters.56     The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesmay wish to raise at a later date theform of the tribunal to be establised for assessing the value of agricultural land for compensation purposes.- 13 -

ATTITUDE OP 3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had hadDOMINIONS.a communication from Mr. de Valera last night.     TheGerman Minister had told Mr. de Valera that if war&quot;broke out Germany was anxious to respect the neutrality of Eire.     Mr. de Valera had replied that his policy was to maintain the neutrality of Eire hut he had it was understood added that Eire would not Pifcourse9 tolerate any German activities5 includingpropagandas on Eire soil.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR DOMINION affairs said that it had been contemplated that we should ask Eire at the least to break off diplomatic relations with Germanys if we became involved in war.Mr. Dulanty had informed him that he thought that ina week Eire would come in on our side as a resultof attacks on shipping.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the momentthere was no action to be taken9 but he thought the Cabinet should be aware of the position.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had hada talk with Mr. Mackenzie King when he was in CanadaMr. Mackenzie King had asked him to tell the Cabinet.and in particulars the Prime Minister thats owing tothe attitude of certain of his colleagues9 it was notpossible for him to make any further announcement ofCanada1s attitude until war had broken out, but that canada would be in it with us.     He also said that hehad had discussions with a large number of people inthe United States5 who all took the view that theUnited States would be in the war sooner or laters andthat nobody could say how soon they would be in.The Cabinet took note of this statement.- 14 -

THE CABINET.    4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he felt sure thatit was in the minds of his colleagues that, if warcame, it would be necessary to make some alterations in cabinet arrangements.     He had no doubt that the right course was to set up a War Cabinet at once on the model of the War Cabinet established in the last war,and this was the course he intended to follow.The Prime Minister added that it might be necessaryto make certain other alterations in the Cabinet.     he asked whether he might assume that his colleagues wereprepared to place their resignations collectively in his hands.     The Prime Minister&apos;s colleagues intimated thatthey willingly agreed with the course proposed.The Prime Minister then asked his colleagues to be good enough to Inform their  Under Secretaries that hewould be glad if they also would be good enough toplace their resignations at his disposal.THE CABINET agreed to this course.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.1st September, 1939.
