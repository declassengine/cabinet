is 9 3THE PRIME MINISTER and THE SECRETARY OP STATEPOR FOREIGN affairs gave the Cabinet information asto certain further developments in regard to thenegotiations with Germany..     These particulars are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard Pile of cabinet conclusions.^THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN APPAIRSsaid that he had had a telephone message thatafiternoon from Count Ciano.     The latter had saidthat he was very grateful for Sir Percy Loraine*message informing him of the communication which wehad received from Herr Hitler.     The Foreign secretary said that he gathered that the Italian Governmenthad been informed of this communication directly byGermany, but were nevertheless deeply appreciativeof our attitude in keeping closely in touch with them at the present time.      Count Ciano had added that signor Mussolini was very strongly of opinion thatwe should not refuse to start discussions withGermany.     The fact that those discussions were going on would, at any rate, gain   time, and the Duceattached considerable importance to this.     Count Gianohad expressed his satisfaction at co-operation with us.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was strongly in agreement with Count Ciano&apos;s view that it was desirable that we should work to gain time.     He wasalso impressed by the fact that if time v/as given,world opinion gathered force, and that after activenegotiations with a view to maintaining peace had continued for a long time, it was harder for any government to take action which would result in warbreaking out.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he hadreceived information about lunch time to the effectthat opinion among the German Staff appeared tobe divided at the moment and that the position inBerlin at the present time was somewhat confused.It would appear that the firm attitude that we had adopted had had a considerable effect.     It wasimpossible to say what part Italian advice had playedin the present state of affairs.Reference was made to the fact that Herr hitler had stated that he had made an offer of peace, and tothe fact that an official statement had been made inBerlin to the effect that Herr Hitler&apos;s communication to the British Government contained proposals fora settlement of the Polish question.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Herr Hitler&apos;sways of thought were perhaps hardly comprehensibleexcept to those who had had contact with him.     Hethought that Herr Hitler had an extraordinary habit of concentrating for a time on one matter, to thecomplete exclusion of everything else.     At the timewhen his communication to this country had beenprepared, his mind had been wholly concentrated onthe question of relations between this country andGermany, and he had almost entirely forgotten aboutthe Polish problem, which had been pushed out of his mind.The Prime Minister said that he thought thatthis was a genuine idiosyncrasy rather thandeliberate craftiness.

SIR REVILE HENDERSON confirmed that hisdiscussion with Herr Hitler had been all about good relations with England, and nothing was said aboutPoland, as to which he. had observed that we must,of course, know what terms Germany proposed to Poland.It was agreed that it would be necessary tomake a communication to the Press that evening whichshould indicate that the reports as to the contents of Herr Hitler1 s communication were completelyunauthorised and quite misleading.     It was generally agreed that it would be better to make a communication on these lines rather than to say definitely that herr Hitler&apos;s message did not oon.t-s.iJ-i. -the terms -of?,asettlement of the Polish question.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explainedthat in the half hour before the Cabinet meeting was held he had taken the opportunity to go throughthe draft reply with some of his colleagues andhad obtained a number of comments on the earlierparagraphs which he would communicate later to thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary.In discussion attention was drawn to thesuggestion in paragraphs 4 and 5 that the PolishGovernment should enter into direct discussionwith the German Government on the diff erencesbetween them, and in particular on the minoritiesquestion.    In this connection attention was drawn to Telegram No. 575 from Paris reporting that M. Bonnet had heard by telephone from theFrench Ambassador in Berlin that Herr hitler had replied in the negative to M. Daladier1sproposal that Germany and Poland should beginnegotiations.   Reference was also made to astatement on the tape that Herr Hitler (or Hera?von Ribbentrop) had asked M. Lipski to see him and that the latter had refused.   It was agreedthat this point would need to be cleared up before the draft of these two paragraphs was finally agreed.Another point made in regard to the draft reply was that it would be desirable to include in it some rather more specific   suggestions asto the action to be taken In the immediatefuture, to relieve tension between Germany and poland.

Since, according to present plans Sir nevile henderson would not return to Berlin until thefollowing days it was agreed that it was undesirable to attempt to settle the terras ofthe draft finally at the present meeting.It was also agreed that Cabinet ministers should send to the Chancellor of the exchequer that evening their comments on the revised draft reply.Some discussion took place whether theproposal that Sir Nevile Henderson should not return to G-QS?ma.,Wuntil the next day involvedany risk.   After discussion it was generally agreed that, in the light of the suggestions which had reached us from various quarters, theright course was that Sir Nevile should not return to Germnay until Monday, 28th August.At the same time it was felt that it would heundesirable to allow room for undue speculationas to the date of Sir Nevile Henderson&apos;s returnand that a communique should be issued to thePress that evening explaining that the replyto Herr Hitler&apos;s communication was being carefully considered, and that it was expected that sir Nevile would return to Germany tomorrow^28th August, taking the Government1s reply withMirkThis was agreed to.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR said thatsuggestions were being made to the effect that thePolish Corridor and Polish rights in Danzig should bemade the subject of a general international guarantee.If an international guarantee was given to Poland and she became dependent upon that for her security ratherthan upon the guarantee of this country and Prance,Poland would no longer be in a position to afford us anyreciprocal help.     We should lose our hold on the East,and an attack upon the West by Germany would be facilitated.       The Secretary of State thought it was ft?the utmost importance that this aspect of the matter should be borne in mind.It v/as agreed that a meeting of the cabinet should be held on Monday, 28th August, at 12 noon atwhich the final draft of the reply to Herr Hitler wouldbe considered.The Cabinet(l)   took note of the statement madeby the Foreign Secretary.(2)   invited the Foreign Secretary toarrange the issue of a communiqueto the Press that evening on thelines agreed by the Cabinet.(3)   agreed that any comments on the revised draft reply should be sentto the Chancellor of the exchequer that evening.(4)   agreed to give further considerationto the revised draft reply at ameeting of the Cabinet to be held onMonday, 28th August, at 12 noon.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.27th August, 1939.

MOST1 SECRET -(The following notes record what was saidat the Cabinet Meeting held on the 27thAugust (Cabinet 44 (39)) relating toMr &quot;D&quot;, the intermediary.   These notescover statements made at intervalsthroughout the Meeting.)At the outset of the Meeting THE PRIME minister asked the Foreign Secretary to inform his  colleagues asto what had taken place through the negotiations  carriedon by Mr &quot;D&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS reminded his colleagues that at the previous Meeting he had informedthem that he had received a message from a neutral whowas in touch with Field Marshal Goering and who wasreturning to Germany on 26th August.   He had consulted the Prime Minister, and had jotted down on paper a suitablereply to send to Field Marshal Goering through Mr &quot;D&quot;.They had thought that it was essential to gain time, andthey had asked Mr &quot;D&quot; to inform the Field Marshal that we wanted to see a settlement reached, and. that we would-give Herr Hitler&apos;s communication the most careful consider-ation.   He had added that we were not clear as to whatHerr Hitler&apos;s letter meant in certain important particu-lars, as to which no doubt Sir Nevile Henderson wouldadvise.   Meantime it was essential that the position onthe frontiers and in regard, to minorities should bequietened, down.   We would exercise our influence on thePoles, and we hoped, that Field Marshal Goering would do what he could to exercise a restraining influence on theother side.About midnight on Saturday/Sunday, a telephone message had been received from Mr &quot;D&quot; that he had seen the Field Marshal, who was pleased with the message.-.&quot;A      . K- &apos; ;At the outset the Germans had. been shocked at the signing    I-i- - i

ty u of the Polish Treaty on the 25th August, hut now, afterthe receipt of this message, they felt that there wasno immediate urgency for Sir Nevile Henderson&apos;s return.Mr &quot;D&quot; had said that he was returning that-morning witha message from Herr Hitler and Field Marshal Goering.He had reached Croydon at 2.30, and had rml^&amp; a shortrecord, of his interview with Herr Hitler and Field marshal goering.The Foreign Secretary read this record to theCabinet.    The record of the interview seemed to make itclear that Field Marshal Goering had definitely re-established his influence with Herr Hitler.    It was alsoevident that Mr &quot;D&quot; had been left with the impression that Herr Hitler had made definite peace proposals inregard to Danzig and the Corridor.   Herr Hitler had saidthat he was very anxious to meet two or three british representatives, who could speak German fluently, inorder to discuss terms with them.The Foreign Secretary said that he and the PrimeMinister had made it clear to Mr &quot;D1f that it v/as not practicable for us to start discussions with germany on a number of diverse topics affecting Anglo-german relations, while all the time there was one possibility that Germany might any day invade Poland and that weshould be at war with Germany.   He had also impressed upon him that it was necessary that there should bedirect discussions between Germany and Poland, and thatfor this purpose&apos;confidence was wanted.   For the rest,we were anxious to reach a settlement with Germany.It had been arranged that a series of rough notes, making some of these essential points, should be prepared bySir Alexander Cadogan, and, after approval by the Prime-Minister and himself, should be handed to Mr &quot;D&quot;, wnowas to return with them to Germany that night.   The object

of this procedure was that Mr &quot;D&quot; might act as a fore-runner and prepare the way for the full British replywhieh would be sent by Sir Nevile Henderson on the ensuing day.Details were then given of Mr nD&quot;.   He was aSwede who had. lived in this  country for ten years but had previously lived in Germany.   He was on terms of close personal friendship with Field Marshal Goering,who frequently stayed with him in Sweden.   Some weeks ago he had. seen the Field. Marshal and. had persuaded, him that it was a great misfortune that he did not understand the British point of view.   As a result it had beenarranged that six British men of good standing should meet Field Marshal Goering and talk to him frankly. !This had. been done about the 10th August.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not seen mr &quot;D&quot; until that morning.   He was not a man who camevery quickly to the point, and he often spent time in discussing unimportant details.   He was not, perhaps,a man who saw fundamea tal points quickly.   Nevertheless,he was a useful person, since he had the confidence ofField Marshal Goering.The Prime Minister then gave details of certain points which had. emerged in the discussion between mr &quot;D&quot; and Herr Hitler and Field. Marshal Goering.A good deal of the talk was concerned with the questionwhether some English person who could, talk German should,go over at once to discuss matters with representativesof the German Government.    The matters whieh it wassuggested should be discussed, were Anglo-German questions.:Mr &quot;D&quot; had asked, how the Polish question was to besettled.   Herr Hitler had. thought that this question should best be discussed between the British Governmentand Poland, but Mr &quot;D&quot; had seen that in practice this

was impossible.   Mr &quot;D&quot; bad. answered, a question which herr Hitler had put to him, as to the reasons for thedifficulties between this country and Germany, by sayingthat tnis country had no confidence in Herr Hitler.The Prime Minister said that he had asked Mr &quot;D&quot;whether he had any indication of the terms which herr hitler would ask for a settlement of the Polish question.Mr &quot;D&quot; had. said No;    but added that he thought that herr Hitler would wish Danzig to. return to the Reich,but that he would, give the Poles a free port.   He thoughtalso that Herr Hitler would ask for the return of the corridor to Germany, but that a new Polish corridor toGdynia would be granted.The Prime Minister said that he had. told Mr &quot;D&quot;that if these were the German terms he could see no prospect of a settlement, and that the Poles would fightrather than surrender the Corridor.   He thought that themost the Poles  could concede would be Danzig, subjectto the retention of special Polish rights and extra-territorial roads for Germany across the Corridor,subject to an international guarantee.The Prime Minister called attention to the factthat Herr Hitler had made no reference to the proposal in his (the Prime Minister&apos;s)  letter for an internationalguarantee by all the Powers of the settlement to bereached in regard, to Poland.   He thought it was quite possible that Herr Hitler had never noticed this refer-ence, as his mind was concentrated on other matters.The only way to get Herr Hitler to understand thingswas that they should, be discussed with him by somebodywho was accustomed to talk to him, such as Field marshal goering.    The use of Mr &quot;D&quot; was that he was an inter-   ^intermediary who could talk to the Field Marshal, who, inhis turn,  could put points to Herr Hitler.    He agreed-4-

that the points which Mr &quot;D&quot; was to put to Field marshal goering and. Herr Hitler should be confined to a fewsimple points, such as that we could not deal withAnglo-German relations until the Polish question had\ been settled;    that in our view it was essential thatdirect negotiations should take place between Germanyand Poland, and. that any agreement should be guaranteed by the Great Powers?    and that while we desired a settle-ment with Germany, we would certainly not fail to carryout our obligations to Poland.   He thought that it was desirable that the despatch of our reply to Herr Hitlershould, be deferred, until the ensuing day, when Mr &quot;D&quot;would fly back to this  country.In reply to the Home Secretary,,THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that the Polish government did not know about Mr &quot;D&quot;.   Although he appreciated therisk of suspicion arising if negotiations were carriedon through a secret intermediary without the knowledgeof the Polish Government, he thought it was essentialto maintain absolute secrecy as to these negotiations.THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR AIR called, attentionto the fact that Field Marshal Goering had said that although Herr Hitler was a very great man, he was not avery great negotiator.   He thought that Field marshal goering would like to be entrusted with the negotiation of a settlement.SIR NEVILE HENDERSON agreed that when the negotia-tions were nea.r the point of agreement, Field marshal goering would, like to come to London to deal with the concluding stages.Later in the Meeting THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR -FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that Mr &quot;D&quot; had given him tounderstand that he thought that it was now appreciatedin Berlin that if Germany invaded Poland&quot;we should go-5-

to war with. Germany.    This had not been the case threemonths ago.The Foreign Secretary asked the Prime minister if he expected to obtain any new material from Mr &quot;D&quot;after his return the next day.THE PRIME MINISTER replied in the negative.Nevertheless, he thought it would be wise to wait and see whether Mr &quot;D&quot; made any report.    If not, the reply which had been prepared should be sent.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he was rather afraid that the issue might be somewhatconfused as the result of these rather informal and secret communications.   He thought it was desirable tomake it clear that Mr &quot;D&quot;, when he went to Berlin tonight-,went not to carry our answer, but rather to prepare theway for our main communication.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed generally with this  course.The Cabinet took note of the above statements in regard to the informalnegotiations with the German Govern-ment with Mr &quot;D&quot; as an intermediary.Ri richmond T err a ce, S .W. 1,27th August, 1939 .
