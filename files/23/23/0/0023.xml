(1)   With reference to Cabinet 60 (20) Minute 6, ;THE PRIME MIHI3TEH, as a matter of urgency, stated that   -   :a. question had arisen in regard-to the disarmament ofGermany.     Prussia had to a considerable extent carriedout the disarmament provided for in -the Treaty of Ver-sailles and the. Sps Agreements, but Bavaria had not done so, and had retained a large number of rifles and machineguna for the Einmhnorwehr, as a safeguard against a recrudescence of communism.A telegram dated December 26th had..JWT7i&quot;T)een^recei&apos;Ted.---&apos;^from Lord Kilmarnock (Berlin) notifying that the military control Commission had received, a fresh note from-the^GermasrGovernment on the question of the Einwohnerwehr, and hadforwarded recommendations to the Council of Ambassadorsthat the following demands should be made in reply1.    That within a fortnight of the receipt bythe. German Government of the reply by the Councilof Ambassadors all machine guns and half therifles In the herds of the Einwohrorwehr shouldbe surrendered.2, - That half of the remainder of the rifles shouldbe surrendered mithin another month.3.   That within a further month all rifles shouldbe surrendered.Lord Kilmarnock had pointed out, as Lord DJAherror had urged before ,:. that a very serious crisis would be preci-pitated if the Council of Ambassadors adapted the- above recommendations. -  If threats were made, the question would arise as to whether the Allies were prepared toenforce them.The Cabinet felt that this might in the immediate
future involve a decision of the very first magnitudeVand that preliminary enquiries for information hearing onthe decision ought at once to &quot;be initiated.In this connection the attention of the cabinet was invited to a&apos;despatch from Lord D&apos;Abernon (Berlin)dated December 7th, circulated by the Foreign office,covering some Kotes on a Visit to Bavaria, dated December by Major-General Neill Kaloolm.     Calient features of theseNotes were an increase in the Binwohnerwehr in Beveria byabout 70,000 men since the Spa Conference, and an impression that many people in Bavaria would be glad to accept a compromise.The attention of the Cabinet was also.oalled toa speech recently delivered by M. le Fevre, the lateFrench Minister of War, which showed that he had resignedon this very question.later on in the Meeting of the Cabinet, SIR EYRECROVtS attended and made a statement to the following effect.     The German Government maintained that they havedone their &quot;best to carry out the provisions of the protocol of Spa in regard to disarmaments     They claimed to have&apos;&apos;been fairly successful, everywhere except in East Prussiaand BsvarisoAs regards East Prussia they stated that they hadbeen confronted with exceptional difficultj.ee owing to thegreat influx of Russians- at the time of - the Bolshevistadvance-on Warsaw, end their subsequent defeat by lieBoles, which had resulted in great numbers of Russianscrossing the frontier, with the necessity of retainingconsiderable,local forces for the purpose of disarmingthem.     They apprehended the possibility of a freshBolshevist attack on Poland with the recurrence of similary
incidents and consequently asked that they should not bopressed to disarm East Prussia too quickly.    In Bavariathey explained that there was considerable apprehension ofa recrudescence of the Bolshevist movement, which led tothe establishment there of a Red Republic in 1919.    Theattitude of the Bavarian Government was that they wouldnot disarm the Einwohnerwehr while the Communists stillwere in possession of arms.    Both the people and the Govern-ment o^ that country said in effect, &quot;You can come andoccupy our country and maintain order there if you wish,but we cannot disarm the Einwohnerwehr, while the danger of bolshevism exists&quot;.    The Military Commission of Controlhad sent a Note on December 11th, in which they had pushedaside the excuses of the Germans and had insisted on the fulfilment of the Protocol of Spa.    On Christmas Eve theGerman Ambassador had called at the Foreign Office and had informed them that he was expecting a further reply from thGerman Government on this question of disarmament.    Up to now the Foreign Office had not received it.    They did not know whether the Note referred to by the German ambassador was identical with the Note referred to in Lord Kilmarnock&apos;&apos;telegram of December 25th, but an yet they had not receivedthis, either.    Meanwhile the Council of Ambassadors inParis had decided that the military Representatives at versailles should be called upon to draw up a Report on thepresent state of disarmament in Germany, which would beavailable ^or the Governments, who ought to whw- some deci-sion before January 10th.,  the date fixed by -the ProfOpolof the Spa Conference for the reduction of one German army to 1*0,000 men.    Sir Pyre Crowe had been in &quot;telephonescommunication with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, who had suggested that the Cabinet should wait-a day or two before taking a decision, in order that the
text of -^German--Go wrnmen-^ might hebefore them, and in order that&apos; they might heve the-opinicraof lord; 3)*Ahernoa- who wee- due in London 033 December 29th,and that meanwhile; they should obtain the opinion of theChief of the Imperial, General Staff on the &quot;mill taryaspects of the question.      Sir Eyre Crews added that theCouncil of ambassadors had. referred the whole question of disarmament to the. Governments.On the facts before them there was 390 difference of opinion in the Cabinet that the disarmament of Sermonysatisfactorilyhad bean carried ouy so far, particularly as regards the handing over and destruction of artillery, and that theaxisteace of a certain number of machine, guns and rifl.es,even though a technical violation of the fresty of Yer-sallles and the Protocol of Spa, did not in itselfconstitute a daBgea?0    We sfoould therefore endeavour to induce our Allies to adopt a similar view and to avoidtbreats of action, each as the occupation of the wu.hr,sarrisd outwhioh/mgKt preeipitats- a very serious crisis and involveoonseouepoes- that it was impossible to foresee.$HES CABIHET agreed -(a) 3?hat the Secretary of State for War shouldtafee immediate steps to warn the British.**     Jtepresentctlvo cn uhe Versailles Councilnot to agree to recommend say extreme measure^h&amp;lag. tc.io3n towards Germany.ib ) $hat the Secretary of State for War shouldbefore Thursday ne.wt, circnlate a considered opinion of -the 0- a.

(*) wltfc. re1M**m*e to cabinet 7* (2$), efinofcdston S     3 9 PLjosed the: Prime Minister, &amp;s-a matter of urgency, communicated t*jalief his colleagues the results of certain conversations he had?jnd; .  -had with Sir Allan Smith and Mr Arthur Henderson during theChris tunas holiday on the subject of Unemployment.   Sir AllanSmith had suggested to him that a voluntary fund should heraised by a levy on employers and employed of ld. in the  ,the proceeds of which should be devoted to the alleviationof unemployment, which Sir Allan Smith anticipated wouldbecome worse during the coming months.   Mr-Arthur Hendersonhad then been consulted about the proposal, which was entirely new to hiia.   Mr Henderson&apos;s first comment had been thst thosewho had made provision for unemployment by means of contributions-tienc extended ever years would decline to make a now contri-butisn for the benefit of those who had been less provident.Sir Allan Smith and Mr Arthur Henderson had then been askedto confer on this subject, and, after prolonged consultationduring the whole of Sunday last, had reported that the scheme would be of no value unless it was made compulsrry.    Otherwise,great numbers of trade unionists would decline to contribute,including the miners, who bud no present fear of unemployment\the engineers, who had their own scheme;    domestic servants,and others.   Unless all these classes participated, a voluntaryscheme would inevitably break down.   Sir Allan Smith and MrArthur Henderson had therefore suggested that the scheme should be compulsory and that the State she-aid co-operate,with a view to the formation of a great national fund for therelief of distress.    They-had suggested that a Committee shoulbe appointed to Investigate the question, to be composed halfof employers and half of employed, with a Cabinet minister in the Chair.During the meeting the Prime Minister received fromSir Allan Smith the following&apos;suggested Terms of Reference:-&quot;To. consider and report within a monthas to  (I) The causes of the present unemployment:(3) Whether-  in order to cope with the
o 9 n06 (distress arising from unemployment, a fundv should be established on the basis of e.*m-pulsory contribuf-ions over and above those provided by the Unemployment Insurance Act,1020, such contributions being made by allclasses of the community other than thoseunemployed:(3) If no, in what manner should the fund beraised and administered, and in what formshould .     it be applied in the case of those for whose benefit it is provided.As a preliminary observation, the Cabinet generally agreed that, if the enquiry was undertaken at all, the firstitem cf the Terms of Reference should be amended in some such direction as the following draft&quot;(1) The extent and probable duration anddevelopment of the present unemployment&quot;.The question of the establishment of aspecial Enquiry was adjourned for furthercons ideration0INFORMATION \ ) In the course of the previous discussion the suggestion as TO EXTENT .I OP UI-IBMPL3Y-&apos; was made that a circular should be sent out to the Lord Mayors&apos; KIT ISLOCALITIES and Mayors of all towns, asking for information as to the ex- 1AD MEASUREST6 DFAL WITH   tent of unemployment in their respective areas, and theIT.measures which were being undertaken .t* cope with it.   Itwas pointed out that information as to the extent cf unem-ployment was available in the Ministry of Lab ur. and therewas same evidence to show that Lord St. DavidsT Committee hadtaken steps to ascertain the measures already undertaken to cope with It.The Cabinet invited the Minister of Labourand the Minister of Health, after enquiryfrom Lord St. Davids;  Committee&apos;, to supply the Cabinet with information as above.
1* SS!S?i?;T   ^ mtb ^ermae to Cabinet 52 (80), Conclusion 5, theHfflfclN SCOTLAND. Cabinet had under consideration the Final Report of theLand Settlement Committee on the land settlement of ex-Servicemen in Scotland (Paper 0.P.-3243), and were informed that theCommittee bad estimated that if land settlement in Scotland was to proceed on the existing basis, a total capital expendi-ture of at least  18,000,00C to settle the civilian mud ox-Service claims would have to be contemplated.    If the economiserecommended in the Report were adopted, the problem could be disposed of at an estimated capital cost of between  13,000,000and  14,000,000.    The Committee, realising that it was not practicable to find capital moneys of this amount at thepresent time, had agreed to recommend that further sums of 333,000 and  750,000, making in all  1,083,000, should bemade available for land settlement during the financial year1921-22^ the moneys tc be devoted to the provision of equip-ment, and the economies indicated in the Report to be putinto operation;   the whole situation to be again reviewed inIS months&apos; time in the light of the progress made in thainterval.    Reservations to the Report had been made by theSecretary fcr Scotland, with special reference to paragraph20. which recommended a drasfim alteration in the method of administering land Settlement in Scotland, and to paragraph31, which recommended that loans for the purchase of stockshould be limited, as in England, to a sum not exceeding 50per cent, of the valuo of the stock to be purchased,   and thatloans in that proportion should only be&apos; granted in exceptional circumstances.In the course of the discussion the Cabinet were remind-ed of the pledges which had been- given to the ex-Service menat recruiting meetings, and also prior to, and in the course of,,the. Ceneral Election of 1918*Comment was made on the very slow progress attained todate, and it was urged that, the difficulties might be solved
by prwM:Lng-the..ex^ land, and materials withwhich to erect their own houses, etc.   It was also suggestedthat expenditure on land settlement should not be charged to. a particular year, but that the money should be raised bymeans of an issue of Land Stock.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the finance-ial position would not be bettered by a Cabinet decision thatthe requisite&quot; i&amp;kais should be borrowed in the market0   the counties and Btwxexpal Authorities were borrowing in themarket for housing, and next Session the Exchequer would befarced to borrow also for housing and road purposes.   It vaerecordingly preferable to meet the    calls for land settlementout of revenue.   With regard to the Report, he had informed the Secretary&apos; for Scotland that he was prepared to acquiesce in the recommendations, subject to, the following conditionsl**(i) !That it was clearly understood that theExchequer was not committed to the pro-vision of further capital moneys in ayear&apos;s time:(ii) That an announcement was made to theeffect that &quot;die government accepted and intended, to enforce the economiesrecommended in the Report:(ill) That men participating in land seizuresshould bo&quot; debarred from benefiting underthe scheme:(iv) That the scheme should be confined to ex-Servioe men: . .and in the S*cr^tary for Scotland&apos;s reservation on organisation, on condition:-    - v That t1lQ present Chairman of the Board ofAgriculture for Scotland should be retiredon pension:(Sri) That henceforward agricultural services InScotland should be borne on the Vote, andthat the Agriculture (Scotland) Pond shouldbe reserved exclusively for land settlementpurposes.^Ths Secretary for Scotland informed the Cabinet thatthe recommendations contained in the Report merely touchedthe fringe of the subject and could not. be regarded as inany way providing a final solution.   As an instalment,however, he welcomed-them.    After emphasizing the nature 61the pledges which had been given to the ex-Serviee men,
3 3 the informed the Cabinet that the administration  . for whichhe was responsible   criticised in the Report had been inexistence since 1911 and had worked&apos; satisfactorily.   Notmerely would any change require legislation, but &amp; change would in itself he a reflection on the Board of agriculture for Scotland.   The present system had the entire approvalof Sir A, Rose, the Director of Land Settlement,After some further discussion it was agreed -That the Prime Minister, the Secretaryfor Scotland and the President of theBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries,should as soon as possible see Sir R,Wright, Sir R, Srigg and Sir A. Rose,with a view to ascertaining whetherland settlement in both england and scotland could not be cheapened andexpedited by the offer to applicantsof bare land plus facilities for   .erecting their ownaccommodation, etc:That,pending this interview, furtherconsideration of the Report should be postponed.(a)(b)
3 31ffi-SATIOM Wlth reference to Gab^et 63. (SO), Conclusion 10, the$MISTERING- Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the home department.Secretary (Paper C.P.-2269),, setting out fully the reasonsfor the view that the Home Office should be the Departmentto which should be assigned the responsibility for dealingwith questions of Workmen&apos;s Compensation,The Cabinet were informed that a decision on the ques-tion of the administering Department was required in orderthat steps might be taken to draft a Bill for Cabinet consid-eration on the lines of the recommendations contained in theReport of the Departmental Committee on the subject.   It was-pointed out that not only would the Bill be a most controver-sial one, but that the subject of workmen&apos;s compensation, beingolosely connected with that of National Health Insurance, itwould be most difficult to make drastic alterations to theformer without serious reactions cn the latter.The Cabinet were reminded by the Lord Privy Seal that -by arrangement with the Prime Minister he had given a pledgein Parliament that legislation next year should, be reduced toan absolute minimum., ana that if possible there should be noAutumn Session.    He wished,, therefore,  fo impress upon hiscolleagues the importance of refraining from bringing forwardBills other than Bills of vital necessity, and to.draw attention to a rule that the Government could take no responsibility for Bills introduced by Departments two monthsafter the commencement of next Session-.After some further discussion, in the course of whichit appeared that the Cabinet were generally of opinion thatin the near is:tare       .it would be undesirable to undertake a controversial measuresuch as was now under consideration, it was agreed -To eostpone indefinitely the further con-sideration of the question raised in theHome Secretary&apos;s Memorandum (Paper2269) ,
(6) The Cabinet, had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Food Controller (Paper CP.-2267) ashing for a decision as.to the maintenance, after the closing of the Ministry ofFood, of the following ancillary services which had been undertaken either by Cabinet direction or at the requestof other Departments of State;    and also a Mote by theSecretary to the Cabinet (Paper CP.-2319) dealing with the suggested continuance of statistical returns relating to food-supplies(i) TEE MABJTEMCB OP AN EMERGENCY AND road transport ORGANISATION IN SKELETON FORMTHROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, CONTROLLED BY a nucleus HEADQUARTERS STAFF IN TOUCH fflTHFOOD SUPPLIES.The Cabinet were reminded that the Supply and transport committee had recommended that if the nucleus organisation was to be maintained, it should be of the character recom-mended by tha Pood Controller, the cost or maintenance beingestimated at  85,000 a year, which would cover both head-quarters and provincial staffs.It sraa pointed out that, apart from the question of a nucleus organic ation there was also the question of the stocks of flour now held against an emergency by the vtheatCommission throughout the country.It was agreed - .(i) That the Food Controller should at onestake all necessary steps to dispose ofthese emergency stocks, and(ii)That consideration of the question ofa nucleus organisation should be deferred until the Minister of Transport couldbe present.(il) STATISTICAL RETURNS OP STOCKS 0? FOOD-STUFFS AND SUPPLIES OF HOME 1CILLPD MEATFURNISHED TO THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE.It was agreed -That the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Food Controller should settle the ques-tion of the retention of the staff on the bus isthat these returns should be maintained.-
(iii) THE LAS TALMAS AGREEMENT.The Cabinet were informed that this Agreement had origin-ally been made in order to protect the British government from the monopoly of the American packers.    The Agreementensured a supply of meat for the Army and some surplus forthe civilian population outside the stocks controlled bythe packers, and there were substantial reasons why the ar-rangement should be&amp;llowed to continue, at any rate for afew years.It was agreed  That the President of the Board of trade should circulate a Memorandum on thesubject to the Cabinet.(iv) THE RETENTION 6F THE ORDERS AFFECTINGLIOJJOR PRICES AND DESCRIPTION, AND OPAN ORGANISATION FOR ENFORCEMENT.tIt was agreed -That no decision on this print could bereached until the Cabinet had decided onthe policy to be adopted in the case ofthe Licensing Bill.(v) CATERING SERVICE FOR THE ROYAL PARESDURING THE SUMMER SEASON.It was agreedThat steps should be taken at the earliestpossible date to transfer this service toan outside contractor, who might be approachedwith a view to taking over the plant andequipment at a valuation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S3&apos;.!,.OAocmVhA^ Sna 100,0.
