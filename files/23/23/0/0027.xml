(1) With reference to Cabinet 77 (2?) Conclusion 6, the Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that on the previous day he and some of his colleagues had had a discussion with Sir John Anderson and Generals Macready, Strickland, Boyd and Tudor.

They had asked for an extension of the area of Martial Law to the four counties of Clare, Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford. This was desired for administrative reasons, in order that the whole of the command might be included in one area.

Evidence was placed before the Cabinet indicating that Nationalist and Irish opinion generally would welcome this. The suggestion was made that discipline would be improved, and regrettable incidents by the forces of the crown would be less frequent, if this course were adopted.
