This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.77THE CABINET.THE IRISH SITUATION.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I would ask that a meeting of the Cabinet or a Conference of Ministers should takeplace next week on the situation in Ireland.1. Very strong representations are being made to me by the military authorities that reprisals within certain strictly defined limits should be authorized by the Govern-ment and regulated by responsible officers of not less than Divisional rank. Complaintis made that the troops are getting out of control, taking the law into their own hands,and that besides clumsy and indiscriminate destruction, actual looting and thieving aswell as drunkenness and gross disorder are occurring. In consequence of this, a numberof courts-martial are being held upon soldiers, yet the position of the troops, alwaysliable to be murdered by the Sinn Feiners, is such that it will not be possible to restraintheir anger when outrages occur in their neighbourhood. I do not consider that thepresent Government attitude on reprisals can be maintained much longer. It is notfair on .the troops, it is not fair on the officers who command them. Although thespirit of the Army is absolutely loyal and very hostile to the Irish rebels, there is nodoubt that service in Ireland is intensely unpopular. I have repeated requests fromofficers of middle and senior rank to be allowed to retire or to be transferred. When a post is vacant in Ireland, sometimes six or seven officers refuse it in turn. This is not because these men are not resolute and loyal, but because they feel themselves to be ina false position.It is for consideration whether a policy of reprisals within strict limits and understrict control in certain districts, in which it should be declared that conditions approxi-mating to a state of war exist, would not he right at the present time. It is thoughtby many that such a policy would be less discreditable and more effective than what isnow going on. The recent formidable increase in outrages in particular districts affordsan opportunity for a review of the position. I cannot feel it right to punish the troopswhen, goaded in the most brutal manner and finding no redress, they take action ontheir own account. If they were to remain absolutely passive, they would becomecompletely demoralized and the effectiveness of the military force would be destroyed.On the other hand, when these responsibilities are thrown upon privates, serjeants andlieutenants, many foolish and wrong things will be done which cannot be passed overby higher authority.I ask that this matter shall be formally and definitely considered by the Cabinet,in order that the excesses of the troops may be controlled and the discipline of theArmy maintained.2. I am advised that a system of identity cards, which every male in ireland would have to take out and produce whenever required, would be a most decisive stepagainst the Sinn Fein organization. 1 am advised that this measure is practicable. Itwas applied without the slightest difficulty in the districts occupied by our armies onthe Rhine. A wanted man who is on the run dare not apply to the police or the militaryauthorities for such a card, and would not get one without having his case and conductsearchingly investigated. On the other hand, a system of sweeps and roundings up in large areas would reveal those who had not taken out their tickets, and consequentlylead to the arrest of many men now being sought in vain. This system might beapplied in some districts first.3. I consider that a system of passports should be introduced between GreatBritain and Ireland. There is no reason why the Irish desperadoes should be permitted to transfer their operations over here at any moment they think fit, or come over here for rest and peace whenever the hunt gets too hot for them in Ireland.-4. I am advised that the methods by which the importation of arms and explosives into Ireland is now checked are extremely defective, and that there is no guarantee that considerable quantities are not passing in.I conclude by repeating my request that these matters may be considered at anearly date.w. s. c.The War Office,3rd November, 1920.(b20/4-16)   100   11/20   h&amp;S, Ltd   8685wo
