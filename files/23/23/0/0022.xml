(1)  Attention was called, an a -matdrex-Hrf^aimrency, tos*&apos;-*-ro-t telegram Ho.5hl3&apos;Iel, of December 23, 1920, sent bythe &quot;Var Office to the General Officer Oorr.iandin.fj in Meso-potamia, to: give effeot to the recent Conclusion in regardto Mesopotamia (Finance Committee, 30th Meeting, conclusion (b).It was suggested that this telegram, and. particularlyjparagraph S, went considerably beyond the abo^e Conclusion.In the absence of the Secretary of State for -Var theCabinet agreed not to discuss the matter, but it was sug-gested that the Secretary of State for dar had probablyused his discretion in stating the case to the GeneralOfficer Commanding in the manner he thought best calculated to sfinmlate information from him as to the time and cost,&quot;but it was agreed that it did net embody the decision ofthe Cabinet.    Such decision had not yet been reached, andno action could be taken until an answer had been received.It was also agreed that this telegram ought to betreated both here and in Mesopotamia with extreme secrecy.
(&amp;; The Pohihrt   &apos; had under consideration- a ^noranduram by the Minister of Labour (Paper O.P,-S342) in which atten-tien was drawn tc tho steps taken by the Cabinet since october to deal with the proble:. of Unemploy ent.   reference was made to the slow progress that had been made in certaindl r^r-di ons.In his Memorandum the Minister of Labour also proposedcertain alterations in the policy which had been laid down bythe Cabinet in pursuance of the Report of the Cabinet Committeeon Unemployment:-(i) That Lord St. David&apos;a Committee should beauthorised to make grants *or the repair and maintenance of roads other than readsfor which the Ministry of Transport wereprepared to give assistance:(ii) That the contribution&quot; of S.P per cent.which lord St. David&apos;s Committee were empoweredto grant in aid. of schemes undertaken byLocal Authorities .for the relief of tin era-ployment was inadequate, particularly in poor areas where the unemployed were.   segregated, and that the contribution should be increased.(iii) &quot;^hat further, provision should be wade forthe employment of women:(iv) That, in the event of the training grantof  5 per head not being accepted by theBuilding Trade Unions, the original pro--posal to set up a special scheme on com-pensation against the risk of unemployment,to which the Covernment would contribute,should be adopted.The Coblnet       agreed  (a) That the question of authorising grants from Lord St. Davids&apos;  Committee on roadwork should be brought up for consider a-tion at a later date, alien that Co:- mitteehad made a review -of the while   situationand cere in a position to make a recommend-ation 01i the point:(b) That, in view of the fact that the total amount o^ the schemes which could beundertaken by local Authorities was some BO,000,000,,    it was not. desirable thatthe&apos;percentage of the Government&apos;1 contri-bntion to &apos;he Local Authorities in aid ofany particular so he.ee should exceed SO percent:%) To request the Minister of Labour, theMinister of:Health and the Minister ofTransport, tc give instructions to such the officials as cere in contact with.
Local Authorities to s: phasize in theirdealings with the latter that the Gov-ern-ment cannot increase the proportion of 30 /per cent:(d) That no further steps should he taken toprovide against the unemployment of women,but that emphasis should be laid, whenever possible, upon the great demand for womenfor domestic service:(e) To adhere to the original decision c-f.the Oabihei &apos; (Cabinet      (BO), Conclusion    ),by which a so home of compensation to coverth--   risk of unempfLoyn.ent . ,^hH-^iiii^i&quot;Cn     &quot; to of ex-Service men to the  &quot;Aiding Tradeswas rejected. .($)- In considering the steps which had been taken to-relieve ur*e.rrployrcent, .the Cabinet      had under review thedecisions of the Cabinet regarding short - time In industry generally and in Government Factories.The view was expressed that steps should be taken ftto urge on Local Authorities and employers generally thenecessity, as far as possible, of putting those employed bythem on short time, in order that employment might be rivento the greatest number of people in tire present emergency.A suggestion was made that a circular letter shouldbe sent from the Ministry of Health to Local Authorities,and from the Board of Trade to Employers0    Alternatively,it was held that a circular issued by the Cabinet and pub-lishod in the Press would have more effect.. It was also suggested that a letter might be addressed to trie Chairmanof the Federation of: British Industries and of the Associatioof Chambers of Commerce.,&apos;, and that there might be a specialappeal to Trade Unions, with,, possibly, a Conference cfTrade Unions and employers of labour on the question.The Gcblh^f-       requested  The Committee on Unemployment to considerthe above suggestions and to report thereonin the course&quot;&quot;of the following week..,       (&amp;)- with reference to Cabinet 67 (20),. Conclusion 4,the Qr&amp;&amp;x*$      had under consideration the following resolu-tier, prepared: by the- Uiiempko-ymient. Committee for eonsiderati^;
by the Chine t (P.P.-2311)&quot;Tlvt the Government Dep rteents   dminis-tering Indust-riel est -blishments,    men-ls,n tion..l factories, dockyards, etc., shouldbe instructed to pies their employees en. short time, with a view- to preventingfurther discharges and  hsorbine es manyis possible of those already dischargedend &quot;so  -llevi :tin&apos;, the unemployment oroblemin their tre:.a.&quot;The Cchinet :.--greed - To approve the resolution and to authoriseits circul. .tion to  :.,11 Departments concerned.(5) The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty stated thatthe Admiralty had under consideration the request of theCabinet contained in Cabinet 66 (20), Conclusion 4, to theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, to consider the advisabilityef introducing short time in Government dockyards, and- were endeavouring to meet the wishes of the Cabinet in the matter.In this connection attention was drawn to a further meeting of the Cabinet (Cabinet 69 (20)  ), at which the, &apos; ( Cabine t       ?, 0&apos;/ Lin 4(a))  .Cabinet re-affirmed their Conclusion /that, with a view toabsorption of unemployed labour, the industrial establishments of the Government controlled by the Admiralty and the darOffice should be placed on short time.Attention was drown to the fact that&apos; some 50,000 menwere now employed in Admiralty Dockyards as compared with42,000 in 1914.Admiral Power, Director of Dockyards, explained that,on the one hand, some 0,000.   en were employed on mercantileconstruction in competition with commercial firms.    Thereason it was necessary to employ so large- a number on imer&amp;lwork was due to the increase in the number, size and eomplex-ity of the auxiliary vessels of the Fleet?-   for example,minelayers, oil tankers and mine-sweepers, which had notbeen in existence &quot;before the v-&apos;ar.It was pointed out that the Admiralty had statedtheir intention to make a reduction of 8,000 men by March
Admiral Power explained that on that date 8.000 men would be taken off Naval Votes, but it was hoped to absorbthem in mercantile sbripbuimvdijig, the cost of which would be recovered on the sale of the vessels under construction.The year&apos;s programme for refitting work in the dockyardswould occupy the &quot;hole twelve months with the men now em-ployed.Admiral Power also explained that proposals were nowunder consideration for closing down Haulbowline and PembrokeDockyards, and for modifying the arrangements at Chatham.It, was suggested that, rather than do this, it wouldhe better to put the men on short time in order to save money,to avoid diacharging men, and, if possible, to take on more men.Admiral Power pointed out that one of the great diffi-eultiea in connection with taking^ on mc e men was that allthe men who had bean discharged were unskilled, for whom itwen Id be difficult, to find employment.Mr Mensforth, the ])director-Ueneral of Factories, Wariffice, stated that at the moment there were at Woolwich2^000 men more than in 1914;    at Bnfield the same number as in1914 ^ and at -,/althani rather less.   It would be quite possibleto put Woolwich on short time, though it weuld undoubtedlyresult in a loss of efficiency.    Of 15,600 men in employment,aocie 5,000 were pivotal,&apos;but by cutting down the workinghegrrs of tho-remaining 6,oOC by 25 per cent., it would bepossible to bring in a further 2,000.Attention w&amp;f? drawn to the fact that the surplusindustrial staff   of the War Office over 1914 was 14,000.Mr Metis forth explained that this included the wholeIndustrial area covering th- staff of the Master-General ofthe Ordnance mi the Qjuartermast rr-Cteneral, many of whom wereabsfttfc to he discharged^ and some of   horn-it was hoped toftbaorb into Y^,oIwieh 3n place of temporary civilians who
* - were being discharged from the latter.The Cabinet agreed. -To request the Admiralty and the War Officeto prepare &amp; report, for consideration bythe cabinet in the following week of the steps they propose to take respectively tocarry out the instruction that short time should be introduced in Industrig1Establishments referred to in Min. 4. above.RELANI). (6)        With reference tc Cabinet 74, Conclusion 1, thePrime Minister notified the Cabinet of a letter signed byMr. Arthur Henderson and Mr. adamson on behalf of the LabourCommission which was wording for peace in Ireland, suggeat-ing preliminary measures with a view to a truce, and a verbalcommunication from Archbishop Clune.     The latter was to theeffect that, after interviews with various Irish Leaders,the only onehe had found Michael Collins/with whom effective businessceuld be done.   The latter desired peace, but the mainobstacle was the handing over of arms which Sinn Fein object-ed to and the fact that Collins was the organiser of murder.,The Archbishop was now asking whether this condition wouldbe seceded to and in the contrary event, whether it was worthwhile for him to remain in this country.The Cabinet were- informed that some arms were beingsurrendered in some quantities although data was not avail-gblfe as to the proportion they were to the total.     Stresswas laid on the importance of   doing nothing to cheek the surrender of arms at a time when the forces of the Crownhad at last definitely established the upper hand.Strong views on the other hand were expressed inthe sense that the Cabinet should not lightly reject any measures, even the suspension of the surrender of arms,calculated to lead to an alleviation of the situation, inwhich some deplorable and indefensible incidents had uhquesi-ionably occurred and might pave the way to peace,&apos;The w
The general view of the Cabinet was that the surrender of arms could not bo suspended, but that it wouldbe advisable if possible that Archbishop Clune should not leave this country.Mr. Philip  err was instructed by the prime-Minister to see the Archbishop, and if he thought it wouldbe useful to arrange an interview between him ana the primeMinister.     On the wider question the Cabinet were invitedto consider whether, in view of the fact that Sinn Fein was rapidly being discredited in Ireland it would not be wiser to postpone any further approached towards Sinn Fein untilthe Government of Ireland Act hod been brought intooperation, the date of which should be accelerated.It was reougnised that this involved two greatfurtherrisks,     First the possibility of/compromising incidentswhich might even attain such gravity as to bring on un the intervention of the United States of America, and secondary,the danger of differences between the military and police forces.It was generally recognised that a decision on thepoint depended on the view taken of the possibility of abona fide election to the Southern parliament taking placeearly next year, and that tee character of such an electionwould be very largely determined by the conduct in themeantime cf the military and police forces in Ireland.The Cabinet agreed -That the following should be summoned to fttter3 a sleeting of the Cabinetnext Wednesday :-The Ccmm&amp;rMler-in-Chief,the Forces in Ireland.Sir John Anderson.General Tudor.Qptit-rsl Strickland,General Boyd.
