IRELAND.

Overtures by Sinn Feln.

(2) With reference to Cabinet 65 (20), Conclusion 2, the Prime Minister invited the attention of the Cabinet, as a Latter of urgency, to two communications , both at which had been published in the newspapers, from more or

less responsible Irish quarters, in favour of approaches to a peaceful settlement of affairs in Ireland.

The first communication was a telegram from Father Michael O&apos;Flanagan, of Roscommon, who has been the Acting President of the Sinn Fein Organisation since the imprisonment of Mr Griffith, in the following terms:

"You state that you are willing to make peace at once without waiting for Christmas. Ireland also is willing. What first step do you propose?".

There was no evidence to show whether it was a purely personal telegram, or sent on behalf of the Sinn Fein organisation. Father O&apos;Flanagan was, however, in a position of nominal authority, and the latter interpretation seemed more probable, more particularly in view of the second communication. This was a resolution passed by the Galway. County Council, in which, after an expression of regrets over the existing conditions in Ireland,&apos; occurred the following proposal:-

"We therefore, as adherents of Dail Eireann, request that b?dy  to appoint three delegates who will have power to arrange a truce and preliminary terms of peace, so that a? and may be brought to the unfortunate strife by a peace honourable ? both countries.

We, therefore, as adherents of Dail Eireann, request that body to appoint three delegrates for the purpose of negotiating a truce.

we further request that the British Government appoint three delegates  who will have power to arrange a truce and preliminary&apos; terms of peace, so that an end may be brought to the unfortunate strife by a peace honourable to both countries.

We consider that the initiative lies with the British Government, who should withdraw the ban on the meeting of Dail Eireann for the purpose of appointing delegates, etc."

This resolution had been sent to the Prime Minister; Dail Eireann  and others.

It was pointed out that the first paragraph of the
Galway County Council&apos;s resolution was the first cession on which a Sinn Fein County had conde?ed the  Sinn Fein  policy of murder and outrage.

The Prime Minister stated that he had received a further private letter from the Chief Secretary, from Dublin, in which he reported that the military authorities in Ireland wished to extend to the whole of Ireland the policy of some form of martial law, which the Cabinet had sanctioned for a district in the South West of Ireland. Sir Hamar  Greenwood&apos;s letter further stated that there was a good deal of movement among Sinn Feiners in the direction of approaches towards peace, and indicated his view that, by standing firm, the Government could get what they wanted.

There was general agreement that both the above communications required an answer.

The questions to be answered were summed up as follows ?

(i)Should the Government withdraw the ?an on the meeting of Dail Eireann?

(ii) In the event of an affirmative answer to (i)? should an amnesty he refused to two or three of the leaders against whom evidence of instigation of or complicity in crime is forthcoming?

In the discussion on these questions it was explained that Dail Eireann is a body composed of all the Sinn Feiners elected to the present House of Commons. It claims to include other Irish M.P&apos;c, but this claim is not admitted.

The general trend of the discussion was in favour of withdrawing the ban on bail Eireann, provid ? that an under-taking was given by the Acting President that when it assembled a motion would be proposed ord?ring the cessation of th? murder campaign.  In favour cf admitting to it even those most pr?inently associated with the recent crimes, it was urged that there was little prospect cf capturing these persons, and that consequently little would he lost by permitting all members of Dail Eireann to attend. On the other hand, it was pointed out that, in view of the intense
resentment against such persons, It would be extremely diffi-cult   lor the Government to safeguard them.     On the whole, the trend of opinion veered.in favour of coupling the removal ofthe   ban on bail Eireann by an announcement that the Governmentcould not undertake not to bring to justice certain personsconnected with recent crimes.It was generally agreed, however, that the presenceof the   Chief Secretary for Ireland was Indispensable to adecision on this question,,The Secretary was Instructed to Inform theChief Secretary for Ireland that the cabinet would be glad if he could return at once toLondon, with a view to a discussion at theCabinet on the following afternoon,GEMISTAN. (3) With reference to&quot;Cabinet 52 (SO), Conclusion 4 (d),The Cabinet were invited by tire Secretary of State for Indiato express their opinion as to the expediency of sending a mission from the Government of India to Cabul,In this connection they Mad before them a series of telegrams which had passed between the Secretary of State andthe Viceroy (notably CP. 1996, CP.2031, CP.2178 and cp.2209), as well as others received shortly before themeeting, which were   read by the Secretary of State for India,The posltien, as presented bo the Cabinet, may be summed   up as follows:On 4th May, 1919, British territory in the KhyberPass was occupied by Afghan troops and a. state of warensued.       On 15th May the Government of India submitted proposals for an advance on-Jalalabadj and as the result of a discussion at the Imperial War Cabinet permission was given on 17th May for the Indian Government to   order the advance on Jalalabad..     In the Interval- Mes on 16th May - theAfghan Commander-in-Chief had opened overtures for an armistice, and the British advance was not ordered.
On 20th May the Amir made a formal request for cessation of hostilities which was granted.  Negotiations for peace were then entered upon at Rawal  ?indi  and on 8th  August 1919 a Treaty of Peace was signed, the fourth Article of which hold the way open for the negotiation of a Treaty of Friendship after a probationary interval of six months. the behaviour of the Afghans during the probationary period was not satisfactory.

On 9th  December the Amir wrote to the Viceroy expressing a desire to initiate discussions which might end in a Treaty of Friendship but tho Viceroy, drawing attention to the unsatisfactory behaviour of tho Afghans since the conclusion of peace, replied by offering a discussion limited to an examination of obstacles to good relations in order to clear away misunderstandings and prepare a firm foundation for negotiations of a Treaty of Friendship.

This offer was accepted and discussions followed at the Muss?ric Conference,(14th April - 30thJuly 1920) conducted on the Indian side by Mr. Dobbs the present Foreign Secretary  to the Government of India with a considerable measure of success. In the course of the conference the Afghan delegates expressed themselves willing and empowered to proceed to the conclusion of a treaty of Friendship; but these overtures were not accepted. At the conclusion of the Conference tho Afghan delegates were presented with a written statement of the terms on which the Government of India would be prepared to negotiate for a Treaty of Friendship.

On 6th October 1920 tho Amir addressed the Viceroy suggesting that negotiations be undertaken to conclude a treaty of Friendship, and that to this end a British misson should visit Kabul; a hint was thrown out that Mr. Dobbs presence as head of the Mission would be welcome.


Before a reply could be formulated we learnedfrom a secret but reliable source that the Amir had concluded a treaty with Soviet Russia containingclauses (e.g, the establishment of Bolshevikconsulates near   the Indian frontier) clearlydirected a gainst ourselves,.After consultation with the India office the Viceroy replied to the Amir that.the Treatyof Peace (8th Aug. 1919) had provided for timedespatch of an Afghan Mission to India to negotiate a. treaty of friendship there: that nevertheless Inview of the Amir&apos;s express wishes HMM.G. wereprepared to send their own envoy to Kabul, had theynot in the interval learned of the conclusion of atreaty between Afghanistan and Russia whereby theBolsheviks had stipulated for the location of theirconsulates at Ghazui and Kandahar in return for asubsidy0     As a condition precedent for the despatchof a British Mission the Amir was asked to state the precise - terms of his agreement with the Bolsheviks.The Amir replied on 16th November ina friendly letter in which Me ridiculed theidea that Consulates should be established in returnfor a subsidy, and stated that any RussianConsulates in Afghanistan must conform to Internationalusage, that the    question of establishing RussianConsulates at Ghasui end Kandahar had not been finally settled and that in any case they would not beestablished for the purpose of causing Barm orcreating mischief in Indian territory.     The letterdid not, however, comply with the Viceroy&apos;s request for a statement of the precise terms of-the Amir&apos;aagreement with the Bolsheviks.
The view of the Government of India was that we should beunablo to extract any further details of the Treaty from theAmeer, and that a Mission should be sent to Cabul to establishfriendly relations.     The Secretary of State fbr India was disposed to agree with the Indian Government, but he found his&apos;views werenot shared by the experts in his own Office, or-by Lord Curzon.whom, owing to his exceptional knowledge of&apos;the East, he was accus-accustomed to consult on matters of Afghan policy, a nd with whom henearly always found himself In agreement.     In the .circ.umatane.es3and as, owing to the Conference with the French and ItalianGovernmentsj he had not been able to bring the matter before theCabinet, he had telegraphed the various objections to theViceroy, who had replied In detail adhering to the view already expressed by the Government cf India.In the subsequent discussion, It was pointed out thatthere was already at Cabul a Bolshevist Mission and a turkish nationalist Mission.     In these circumstances, the IndianMission at Cabul would not be in an enviable position.     Accord-&apos;ing to the habits of the Afghans, It would be subjected to .daily rebuffs and Indignities, and every possible attempt,would be made to play it off against the Bolshevist and. Turkish-Nationalist Missions-.     This would be a humiliating position for the representatives of the Government of India, with all its great prestige in the East,     The Mission would feel&apos;boundto reach an agreement, for failure would&quot; be almost tantamount to a fresh outbreak of war.     Hence it would have to takewhat conditions it could get-.     There was a risk that the afghans might succeed In obtaining a subsidy from us whenthey were also receiving subsidies from the Bolsheviks and turkish Nationalists.     Doubts -fiere even expressed as towhether the lives of the- members of the Mission would besecure in Cabul In the existing conditions of an Anti-Britishparty, stimulated by the Bolshevist and Turkish Missions,
41Stress was laid on the danger- from the establishmentof Bolshevist Consular posts at Ohazni and Kandahar, whichcould have no other object than the pro?notlon of propaganda in India.     &quot;The suggestion was made that the right course was to play for time and, without refusing to send a mission to Cabul,, to Insist on a frank reply to our enquiries inregard to the arrangements concluded between the Ameer and soviet Russia as an-indispensable preliminary.&apos;    Above all,we must endeavour to avoid war with Afghanistan, for which wewere prepared neither financially nor from the point of viewof public opinion,.On the other hand, the suggestionw as made that a refusal by the Ameer to give us a frank reply would be tanta-amount to /break ing off of negotiations no less than a failure to reach an agreement at Cabul.      If nothing was done to counteract the Influence of the Bolshevist and turkish nationalist Missions at Cabul, there was no knowing whatdecision miaht be taken.       These Missions might be com-posed of clever and unscrupulous agents, but the Govern-ment of India had at their disposal persons of greaterability and experience, who had only recently conductednegotiations successfully with the Afghans, and had more permanent and substantial advantages to offer to theAmeer.     Tho latter was probably sufficiently shrewd torealise that an annual subsidy of 16 lakhs of rupees fromthe Government of India would be far better-secured than anything he was likely to receive from the Bolsheviks orfrom Nationalist Turkey.On a review of the considerations summarised above,the Cabinet, while inclining towards the plan of endeavouringto obtain from the Ameer a frank answer in regard to his
arrangements with the Bolsheviks as a preliminary tosending the Mission -to Cabul, felt that the argumentswere so nearly balanced that they ought not to takethtU&apos;-.. responsibility of over-ruling the strongly expressed opinions of the Government cf India.     in reaching this conclusion the Cabinet took into account the discouraging effect on the men on the spot of being over-ruled In a matter of policy to which they had givenso much consideration, and on which they were possessed of the fullest local knowledge,The Cabinet therefore sgreed -That the Secretary of State for India should telegraph a summary of the discussion to theGovernment of India, and should inform themthat, while inclining themselves to the policyof obtaining from the Ameer a frank statement -as to the   particulars of his arrangements with Soviet Russia aa a preliminary to sending a Mission to Cabul, the Cabinet -would not   takethe responsibility of over-ruling the considered opinion of the men on the spot.I UNEMPLOYMENT, (4) With reference to Cabinet 49 (20), ConclusionHousing 2, Cabinet 51 (20), Conclusion 4, and Cabinet 55 (20),Scheme sand Conclusion 3, the Cabinet had before them the following Dilution,documents:-(a)   Second Interim Report of Committee(Paper C .P.-2145).&apos;. -A Memorandum by the First Commissioner*        of Works (Paper CP,-2162),A Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (Paper CP.-2181).A Memorandum by Sir Li YiOrthiiaetonEvans (Paper C .P.-2095).A Memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (Paper CP.-2195).(b) Third Interim Report of Committee(Paper C.P.-2202).(c) Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (Paper CP.-2235).
The Ohair/an of the Cabinet Committee, in presenting theSecond and Third Interim Reports, reviewed the position ofthe Unemployment problem.    The number of the unemployed hadrapidly increased during the last three months and was aon-tinning to- do si.    The Cabinet, on October 14, 1930, had approved the Committee&apos;s First Interim Report, which dealtchiefly with arterial and main roads, and work on these was proceeding.    The Committee&apos;s Second Interim. Report dealtmainly with schemes for absorbing some- *f the unemployed on housing Schemes.   Negotiations with the Building Trade unions had been-proceeding -far eighteen months, with very barrenresults,    A scheme for recruiting adult apprentices in returnfor concessions for &quot;wet time&quot; had been negotiated., but it was doubtful whether in fact any such apprentices had been taken*n, and the employers were trying to recede from their.-offer to pay.;5$ per cent. for time lost owing to had weather. -&quot; TheCabin-t Committee had examined 11ring-fence&quot;^schemes for building 10,000 houses in the London district, where the men employed -would be drawn exclusively from the ranks of ex-service men, who would be taught by selected skilled opera-- fives.    These schemes, it was estimated, could absorb 5C,000trainees, who would become skilled in due course, and 7.5.,-OOQ-attendant unskilled men.    When this proposal was submitted tothe -Trade Unions they had ask d for substantial compensationagainst -the-unemployment which might fellow the dilution oftheir trade.   To met this demand, a mapVrity of the Committeenow put before -the. Cabinet two alternative proposal s4 thesecond of which.,was the less objectionable to the othermembers of the Commdtt.ee, but to both of which they were opposed.    The first alternative offer-d to compensate thebricklayers, plasterers, slaters and tilers, to the extent towhich, as a result of the introduction of ex-Service men, theaverage rate&apos;of unemployment for ten years from January, 1921,is in excess of a certain stated unemployment rate, based on
pre-war experience.    The second alternative contemplated thecreation of a reser-e fund, to meet additional unemployment,to be built up out of extra membership,contributions made tothe Unions by the dilutees  (Paper CP,-2145, page 4).    Inthis, second ease the Government would in effect be paying the extra contribution by adding it to the dilutees&apos; wage,  andthe sum thus obtained would be available for the general purposes of the Unions,,In reaching a decision on these proposals .the cabinet considered chiefly nfteso much the practical difficulties inthe way e,f the adoption of either, as the important principle which was raised by both.    Was the Government to admit theclaim, by Trade Unions   which did not in any case representall the men in the trade -  to prohibit men to undertake workwhich they could not themselves perform, except on condition that &quot;the.; State guaranteed the Union members aa inst unsmploy-mont for a period of years?    To admit this principle would bet* strengthen the Trade Union in their eeclusiveness and want of adaptability to rapidly changing industrial conditions, andthe claim would be. certain to be made by other Unions who hadtaken on ex-Service men.It was pointed out,  en the other hand,  that the Govern.^ment was asking the Unions not only to dilute their ranks withpotential competitors, hut also to teach men ignorant of thetrade to: become competitors&apos;, in trades., which before tho war were notorious for the high percentage of unemployment, andwhich raihht became so&quot; again after the house-building bo emceased.    Was it unreasonable that the&apos;Unicns should seek toprotect their funds against this new liability?    Further,however anti-social the rules   guarding &quot;the entry intc tradesmay.&apos;be, they, had in fact the support of long tradition and   .frequent recognition by the Government.    The Treasury Agree-ment of IP 16 was an example of such recognition of restrictive practices.    On the other hand, it was held that the analogy of the Treesury Agreement was hot a sound one, as its primary
object was to safeguard the positions on their return of menwho&apos;had gone to the Front to fight, and for whom the men left a     behind: were in the position of trustees.In considering the general principle, the Cabinet were reminded that in the event of refusal by the Unions to assistthe &quot;ring-fence&quot; schemes, the task would fall to the Officeof Works, acting for the Government and through the LocalAuthorities, and-it might very well be that the Local Authori-ties, especially where the Labour&apos;Party was predominant, would refuse to co-operate with the Office of Works in employingnon-Union labour.The Cabinet agreed --(a) That the two alternative proposals putforward In the Second Interim report should be rejected;(b) That no offer on these or-similar lines should be made to the Trade Unions. but&quot;ring-fence&quot; schemes should be immediatelyproceeded with, ex-Service men put to workupon them, and trainers obtained on such terms as would Induce them to join.     TheTrade Unions should first be informed and asked to co-operatet(c) That the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment&apos;&apos;       should consider whether or not to proceed further with the negotiations for the absorp-tion of adult apprentices, and shouldconsideralso any f&amp;other details consequent upon (a)and (b) above.(The Mlnisber of Health and the First Commissioner ofWorks wish to record their dissent from the above conclusions).Finance of The Cabinet considered the financial recommendations ofRing-FenoeSchemes.    the Committee consequence upon the acceleration of the building programme (Paper C.P.-214.5, Page 6), and. agreed to their proposals in the following amended form;-(a) That tho Treasury should undertake to finance the London County Council and ether Author!-ties on condition of their borrowing the addi-tional 4jr millions required; which it was estimated would be spent within 12 months when-ever called upon to do so by Sir Harry Goschen&apos;sCommittee :(b) That an assurance be given to the.EdmontonLocal District Council that the money requiredfor the acceleration of their building pro-gramme would be forthcoming either through a.special issue of the Middlesex. County CouncilHousing Stock or otherwise., the Treasury-advancing the money meanwhile on the same    *condition.&apos; - - -   -
In considering the Committee&apos;s recommiendation that 2,000men should he employed by the Admiralty at a cost of  200,000&amp; to scrape and paint ships (Paper 0.F.-S145, page 7), theCabinet were reminded that the Admiralty were employing onthe )r industrial staff 16,000 more men than before the War;the War Office 17,000, and the Ministry of Munitions and AirMinistry 13,000, and that the Finance Committee were engagedin trying to reduce the expenditure on the Fighting Services.The Cabinet agreed --*be asked toThat the First Lord Should/consider the advisability of putting the regular em-ployees of the Dockyards on short time,with a view to alleviating the unemployedproblem in the Dockyard towns.nUnemployment        The Cabinet postponed the consideration of the sectionsIt Woolwichini National   %  the Committee-&apos; s Report dealing with National Factories,factories.but agreed  That the Secretary of State fcr War shouldbe ask-d to  consider the advisability of putting employees in National Factories on short time, with a view to alleviating theunemployment problem in their areas.State-aided(migration.The Cabinet concurred in the following recommendationsof the Committee for encouraging Overseas Settlement as a means of relieving abnormal unemployment (Paper 0.P,- 145,page S) :-(a) That the time for receiving applications from ex-Service men a nd women &quot;or freepassages should be extended &quot;vor one year:(b) That grants in aid cf settlement within theI   Empire should be placed at th   disposal ofthe Overseas Settle:, ent Conmittee,insofar as they may.prove to be required, at a ratenot exceeding  50,00.; a. month from: January 1,1921, to March 31, 1921, with preference to ex-Service men:(a) That the Colonial Office, after negotiation with the&quot; Dominions, should formulate a schemeforof assisted emigration on a largesubmission to the Cabinet,,.scale-nird Interimkmcrt.The Cabinet postponed the consideration of theThird Interim Report of the Co- wit tee on Une,-plcyment (Paper C.P.-2202) - and of a Me crandumby the Minister of Labour,, proposing the do- -pointment of a Departmental UnemploymentCommittee (Pap^-r 0 .P,-223r5)...

fef R^!JfT^S     (2)   The Sectary of State for ftar raised, as a matterol urgency, the terrible and destitute condition of the hordeof refugees from the Crimea, now concentrated in the Constan-tinooln area   consequent on General Vrangel&apos;s collapse.   Allreports agreed that these people were in a most desperatesituation,  crowded, without food, in hastily improvisedcamps, or still on board ship, exposed to great risks of an outbreak of pestilence.    The French were rendering assistance and had dealt with about 40,000.    The Americans were also stated to be helping un to the limits of their capacity onthe spot,,   Mr Churchill stated that on the previous Monday hehad sent a telegram to the General Officer Commanding, inwhich, after repeating the decision of the Cabinet to avoid any re-equipment of General vVrangal, he had informed him thathe was not debarred from giving such assistance as he couldon the grounds of humanity,   Mr Churchill no^S asked that theGeneral Officer Command.ing, Constantinople,, might be allowedto spend up to  20,000 on the work of relief.The Conference agreed  (a) To approve th- action already taken bythe Secretary of State for *ar, as sum-marised above:(b) To anprove in principle? the further pro-posal of the Secretary of State for war that the General Officer Commanding, Oon-stantinople, should he authorising ?d to spendup to  20,000 in relieving destitute civilianrefugees, particularly women and children,and the sick and wound&apos;d,  on the clear1 understanding that thev* should be nosemblance of &quot;-participation in any steps for the re-equipment or re*formation -,ofGeneral %rangel&apos;s forces :(c) That the Prime Minister, in the course ofthe negotiations with th--- Russian TradeDeletion, should raise the question ofthese and other Russian refugees, witha vie--- to tlyir repatriation to Russia.
JHE SITUATION       (3) Arising out of the forgoing discussion, th- Chan-cellor of the Exchequer called attention to the fact thatthe British Government were almost alone in rendering- assist--ance to various bodies of rr fugees in different parts of teeworld.    In addition to the maintenance of refugees in Egypt,Mesopotamia and lemnos, we had spent large sums in settlingrefugees in Serbia, where we had had to guarantee the SerbianGovernment against loss.    He was about to circulate a Memoran-dum to the Cabinet dealing with the position of Austria, whichthe Reparation Commission reported to be hopeless.    The Corn-mission itself had no resources out o f which to sustain Aus-tria, and the matter was therefore being referred by them tothe various Governments.    In the opinion of the Chancellorof the Exchequer the time had come when His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment must, in the interests of the people at home, resistthese constant appeals to assume external financial burdensthe greater proportion of which our Allies endeavoured to throw upon this country.The Conference toot note of, and gen-rallyendorsed these views.

That the Finance Committee should assembleat an early date to r -view the wholefinancial situation o,? the country, withspecial, reference to the menace of gravetrade depression:(b) That the President of the Board of Tradeand the First Gomimlssirner Of Works shouldbe added to tho Committee.

The subject had been fully examined by a DepartmentalCommittee appointed by the Home Secretary (Gmd.1037), andthe Committee had approved tin- continuance of the two-shift system for an experimental period of five years.    The HomeAffairs Committee r* commended to the Cabinet that steps shouldbe taken to secure the passage of amendments in the report stage of the women, Young Persons and Children&apos;s employment bill, for the purpose of carrying out the recommendationsof the Departmental Committee.. , .The Conference concurred in the rocom-mendation of the Home Affairs Committee,

(7)  With reference to H.A.C. Conclusion 78, Minute 1, the Conference had under consideration the question whether the unexpended balances of the proceeds of taxes on motor vehicles should be surrendered unto the Exchequer at the end of each year, or should be allowed to accumulate  in the hands of the Ministry of Transport from year to year. It was maintained that this procedure would establish the principle of a private purse owned by Government Departments  which would, not be liable to be called on to meet the general ?eeds of the nation. The Conference were, however, informed that the question of principle had been settled in 1999 and that, in the opinion cf the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it was not possible to administer the head Fund  efficiently unless the proceeds of the motor vehicle  ? were allowed to accumulate in ? hands of the Ministry of Transport, who would then be able to elaborate Schemes which would operate for several years at a time.

Attention was drawn to the length of the Bill. It was urged that, as the Bill would have to he passed into law before the end of the present year, it should, be ?tionally reduced in size in order to allay Parliamentary, criticism as far as possible.

The Committee agreed :-

(l) To approve the principle that the unexpended balances of the proceeds of taxes on motor vehicles should not be surrendered unto the Exchequer, but should accumulate to the credit of the Road Fund.

(2)That the Minister of Transport should scrutinise the Bill very carefully with a view to reducing it to the smallest possible proportions and- eliminating all provisions which were not immediately essential.

(3) That the Minister of Transport should have authority to introduce the Bill after all possible reductions had been made in it, into Parliament?

1. The Committee had under consideration a note by theMinister of Transport (C.P.-2122) covering the draft of a Bill, withthe object of establishing the necessary administrative arrangementsfor the collection of the taxes on motor-cars imposed by section 13of &quot; The Finance Act, 1920.&apos;;It was explained that during the debates on the Finance Bill ithad been made clear that all money produced by the taxes to be imposed on motor vehicles would be applied towards the improve-ment and development of roads. The Bill provides for the levyingand collection of taxes by County Councils. The proceeds of the taxes are to be paid into the Exchequer, and, subject to the paymentof certain expenses and specifically assigned revenues, are to he paid out of the Consolidated Fund to the credit of the Boad Fundestablished by the Bill, to take the place of the existing Develop-ment and Boad Improvement Grant.Attention was directed to the principle of the Bill that theunexpended balances of the motor vehicle taxes should be permitted to accumulate in the. hands of the Ministry of Transport from yearto year, and should not be surrendered to the Exchequer at the endof each financial year. It was explained that this proposal had beenagreed between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Transport. It was suggested that the Treasury had not agreedto more than that the proceeds of the taxes should be applied toroads only, and the balance (if any) in hand annually should fall intothe Exchequer.   On the other hand, it was pointed out: (1.) That the Treasury, who were represented at the meeting bySir Hardman Lever, had agreed to the Bill; and(2.) The old Boad Fund was a self-contained fund.The Committee accordingly proceeded to examine the details ofthe Bill on the assumption that the Cabinet would approve theprinciple that the unexpended balances should not be surrenderedeach year. It was explained that under &quot; The Finance Act, 1920,&quot;the duties in respect of motor traffic had been completely alteredfrom a tax on petrol to a tax on vehicles, which would come intooperation on the 1st January. As the result of the recommendationsof a Committee, upon which motorists were strongly represented, ithad been decided to authorise advances from the Boad Fund to theCounty Councils or other highway authorities for the maintenanceof existing roads in addition to the advances permitted under &quot; TheDevelopment and Boad Improvement Funds Act, 1909,&quot; for theconstruction of new roads and the improvement of existing roads.The remainder of the Bill is devoted to provisions for securinguniformity and economy in the licensing of motor vehicles. Theprinciple followed was to change the form of licences from a personallicence to a licence on a vehicle, applicable only to the vehicle inrespect of which it is issued and transferable with that vehicle.Specimens of a tablet were exhibited to the Committee, to be fixed in a prominent position on motor vehicles, containing particulars ofthe licence, which, in conjunction with a registration book identifyingthe owner of the vehicle, would establish the licensing and registra-tion of that vehicle. One effect of this proposal would be to make itdifficult for the traffic in stolen motor-cars to continue.The Parliamentary Counsel was requested to amend the words&quot; receive the proper amount &quot; in order to make them more specific.It was explained that the effect of the definition of &quot; weightunladen&quot; of any vehicle as laid down in this clause might, by increasing the unladen weight of vehicles, bring a vehicle into ahigher grade for taxation purposes than under the existing law, andtherefore be regarded as an increase of taxation requiring a &quot; ways and means&quot;   resolution.     The   Parliamentary  Secretary  to the
Ministry of Transport undertook to consult the Public Bill Office onthe point.was directed to the provision that proceedings forthis subsection for the use of vehicles without a clause 13 (1). Attentionpenalty under licence might be brought at any time within a period of three years from the date of the tune the offence was committed. It was pointedout that under the existing law the period was six months only.It was explained on behalf of the Ministry of Transport that theperiod of three years was modelled on the Income Tax Acts.Clause 13 (4). Attention   was directed  to the provision that all penaltiesrecovered under the Act should be paid into the Exchequer, and thence, under Clause 2 (l) and (3), into the Boad Fund. It waspointed out that fines for oiiences by motorists were at present paidto the credit of the local authorities in which the offences are committed. It was stated that the principles of the Bill had beenagreed with the County Councils&apos; Association, but they had notbeen consulted on this provision, and would probably object.The Committee agreed -To approve the clauses of the Bill, subject to the approval bythe Cabinet of the principle that the unexpended balances of the proceeds of taxes on motor vehicles should not be surrendered into the Exchequer, but should accumulate inthe hands of the Ministry of Transport to the credit of theBoad Fund.Electricity SupplyBill.2. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C.P.-2123) covering the draft of a Bill(Electricity Supply No. 2 Bill) to amend &quot; The Electricity SupplyAct, 1919.&quot;The Committee decided To adjourn consideration of the matter until a complete copyof the Bill had been circulated containing the amendmentsagreed with the Treasury, which it had not been possible toinclude in the print before the Committee.Employment of&quot;Women.3. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C.P.-2124) covering a Beport by a Depart-mental Committee on the shift system of employment of women andchildren.It was explained in the Memorandum that in the Women,Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill now before theHouse of Commons a clause had been inserted to provide for thecontinuance of the arrangement made during the war, under emergency Orders, permitting the employment of women by shifts,each shift averaging not more than eight hours per day. Thetrade unions were hostile to the proposal, arid a motion to deletethe clause had been carried against the Government in Committee,and in consequence the Home Secretary had appointed an Inter-departmental Committee to consider the whole question. that committee, after hearing evidence, had reported unanimously thatthere should be power in the Home Office to make orders allowing the employment of women and young persons on a two-shift systembetween 6 A.M. and 10 p.m., this power not extending to persons under 16 years of age, and being limited in the first instance to aperiod of five years with a view to reconsideration in the light of experience. It was hoped that the modifications of the original proposal would remove some of the opposition. The shift system had great economic advantage in securing increased production
without an increase of overhead charges and also secured theemployment of a much larger number of women than would otherwise be possible. Opinion in the House of Commons wassharply divided, and whatever course were taken would meet with strong opposition. The question before the Home Affairs Committeewas whether steps should be taken in the Report stage to carryout the recommendations of the Departmental Committee. TheCommittee were much impressed by the importance of the proposals in relation to the avoidance of unemployment, and after some discussion agreed That the Home Secretary should take steps to secure thepassage of amendments in the Report stage of the Women,Young Persons and Children (Employment Bill), for thepurpose of carrying out the recommendations of theDepartmental Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W. 1,November 23, 1920.o
