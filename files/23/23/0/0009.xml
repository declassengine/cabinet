D, With reference to Cabinet 59 A. the attention of theCabinet was drawn to the recent outrage near Cork, whichpartook of a more definitely military character than itspredecessors.   In these circumstances it had been suggestedthat an experiment should be made in this particular dis-trict in the application of something in the nature of mart-ial law.   Actions If taken at all, would be in the directionof a Proclamation ordering the surrender of arms and uni-forms in this district to some named person$ possibly the parish priest, and naming a date after which anyone foundin this district with arms or uniforms.in his possessionwould be treated as a rebel.Che Prime Minister reported that the Chief Secretary,after a preliminary Conference with him and afterwards withthe Secretary of State for lax and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, at which certain military details&apos; had beendiscussed, had left for Ireland to confer with the localoiirll and military authorities.   It was not improbable, there-fore, that a definite request for authority to take action inthis direction might be received from him during the day.After some interesting details from several points ofview had been given to the Cabinet of the experience of mart-ial law: in South Africa, and stress had been laid on.:th^sel-ection of a sufficiently large area for the application of \martial law* and on the importance of impressing on the mil-itary authorities that the powers should only be entrusted toexperienced Officers, the Cabinet agreed--&quot;   &apos;That the Prime Minister should he author-ised to telegraph to the Chief Secretary   .in the sense that, subject to the resultof his discussion with the Ideal civil andmilitary authorities, the Cabinet approved the proposal that martial law should he ap-plied in such particular .areas &apos;as lie might consider it necessary.s.
