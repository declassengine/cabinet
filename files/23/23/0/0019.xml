Owing to the bad state of trade,a number of these who had been expected to qualify would be unable to meet the requirement of the Act that contributionsmust be paid in respect cf employment in each, of four weeks before a workman became entitled to receive benefits    strong representations had been made to the Minister of Labour thatthis rule should be waived in present circumstances.    It hadbeen estimated by the Ministry of Labour that the cost ofwaiving the rule, on certain assumptions set forth in the memoranda, would be about  1,000,000, which sum would fallon the funds accumulated in the Unemployment Insurance Fund,and would neither be a fresh burden on the Treasury nor impose a greater charge upon the -Fund than had been allowed for in" the actuarial calculations.The Cabinet agreed  That the proposal should be accepted., subjectto the conditions set out in the Ajjj^0.-i:.z.:j&apos;  and that the concession should be announced in the House of Commons in the course if. ^the Debate on Unemployment on the following day.
