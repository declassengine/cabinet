TREATY OF VERSAILLES.



The Disarmament of Germany.



(1) With reference to Cabinet 75 (20), Conclusion 1, the Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the disarmament of Germany:-

Note from Dr Simon to President of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control (Paper C.P.-2370),

Copy of a Letter from the Secretary, War Office, the Under-Secretary of State. Foreign Office (Paper C.P.-2371),

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (Paper C.P.-2376).

After full discussion, and after hearing the views of Lord D&apos;Abemen and Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson on certain aspects of the question, the Cabinet, in accordance with the general policy indicated in the Conclusions of the previous discussion, agreed -

(a) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make representations to the French Government to the effect that instructions should be given to General Nellet that he should not send to the German Government notes of a drastic character with important political reactions, without first obtaining the consent of the Allied Governments, through the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris:

(b) That the Secretary of State for War should arrange for instructions to be issued to General Bingham that he should not acquiesce in drastic notes of this character being sent to the German Government without first obtaining the consent of the War Office, which would enable the Secretary of State for War to bring the matter before the Cabinet if he deemed it necessary:

(c) That, while a final decision as to the reply to be sent to the German Government could not be reached pending the report of the Versailles Council on the present state of disarmament of Germany, the general lines of our attitude should be somewhat, as follows:-

To accept the proposal of the German Government to complete the general disarmament by the end of February, 1923: to insist on a plan for the progressive reduction at specified dates of the ?avarian Einwehnerwehr: to accept the proposal of the German Government that the date for the completion of disarmament of East Prussia should be postponed until the 


situation between Poland and SovietRussia is clearer, but3 as scon aspossible, to insist on a programmeof progressive reduction here also:-(d) That, after the receipt of the report of the Military Council at, Versailles &apos; theSecretary cf State f..r War, in consul ta-ticn -with the Prime Minister if necessaryshould consider the expediency of issuingthe Note itself, or a corpranigue&apos;, in orderto reassure public opinion&quot;in&quot;this countryand to remove. current misapprehensionsas to any possibility cf aggressive action by Germany.JEER STEESXA^     (2) Arlning -out of the previous discussion, the Cabineti9 Plebis-     considered the question of the forthcoming plebiscite initflt &apos;,r;,-T--1J sbUpper Silesia, and attention was drawn to-^he/attilniaB-orf-iiha.French &quot;President of the Commissionand more particularly to the difficulty -which had-arisen as the result of his refusal, as well as that ef theFrench Government, to expel a M, Korfanty, who had taken action in the Polish interests, which would unquestionablyhave led t* the expulsion of any person wha had adopted a,   corresponding attitude in the German interest.-After consulting the Chief cf the Imperial GeneralStaff, whs deprecated the despatch of British troops fromthe Rhine to the Silesian plebLscitory area cn the ground thatit would deplete the reserves of British forces there at atimw mfasn we had been obliged to reduce the forces in Great ,Britain by the despatch ef troops to Ireland, but admitted that it eould be done as an extreme measure, the cabinet agreed   - Jin .&apos;l/p.p.e.v bi^eiuaThat, in.order to secure the adoption/offair conditions for the plebiscite,,theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should be authorised, as a last resort,to state that the British Government wouldbe willing to send a force not exceeding4 battalions (of SCO men each) from theArmy of Occupation of the rhine to rein-force the Allied Amy of Occupation inSilesia until the ? completion ofthe plebiscite.   While this force would come under the general control of thePresident of the Plebiscite Commission,arrangements should be made that the localcommand in the area in ffhich it was employ-ed should be entrusted to a British officer.
FORjp&amp;K Ff^iuYa    (5)    The consideration of the two previous questionsFrance tod gave rise to &amp; general discussion of our foreign policy,Germany.more particularly in relation to Prance and Germany, andas t^ the best means %t securing mutually friendly and stable relationsNo Conclusions were reached.
M^ABJW-     (4) ,Vith reference^o. ^binet 7C-(SC)t Conclusion 1, iexdDCftbemcn-dnfarmed the Cabinet cf the progress made to date by the. Conference of Experts at Brussels on the subject ofGerman Reparation.    The Conference was being conducted on verybusinesslike linos, and had got away from words and phrasesand was concentrating on figures.    The policy was to treatGermany very much like a bank would treat an old client in aprecaricus financial position, and the German experts as a wholehad shown themselves reasonable and willing to explore thewhole field.   A series of searching questions on the subjectof the German Budget had   been put to the German experts, buttherejiad not yet been time to examine the various replies.The Conference would re-assemble in the middle of January,and there seemed every prospect of some conclusions being reached for consideration at the subsequent Geneva meeting.Lord D&apos;Abe-men was hopeful of getting the Boulogne terms, minusIS per cent, 20 per cent, cr SD per cent.The Cabinet were reminded that Germany was showing a disposition to give as much reparation in kind as passible,and that in effect this policy amounted to giving Prance acertain priority in much the same way as Great Britain had,at an early stage, obtained priority in the matter *f Germanshipse   If it ultimately turned out that most of the reparation payments took the form of supplying Prance with coal and other raw materials, and work in her devastated districts, theeffect would be to create a large German credit in French hands and Great Britain and any other interested Allies would be obliged to have recourse to Prance for their shares of repara-tion, which, in the circumstances, it would be impossible toexact.   In any case, it was clear that France could make nocash payments on this account to the other Allies for at least two or three years, and it might be necessary to stipulate that any cash payments by Germany in respect of reparation   .
.-   - Ths Cabinet generally - agreed that It would be better foreign-matter Britain to take depreciated Marks than to have to rely upon a claim, against France,,The Cabinet &quot;ere then reminded of a proposal for theimposition of an Export Duty on German exports, payable inthe Currency of the consignee country, the Duty to be credited tc the Reparation Account.    Such a Duty mould belarery easy to collect, and would be favoured by public opinionjn this country..  So far as was known^ no serious obection had been raised in Germany to the proposal, though the dis-eussion at Brassels had proceeded en the basis that the duty would be paid in Marks and not in the currency of the con-sign ee country.The Cabinet were informed that, insofar as a Duty of this character prevented the export of German goods, it would tendto perpetuate the collapsed Exchange.   Reference was also madeto a similar proposal,under which large German syndicatesof the value would credit to the Reparation Account 20 per cent./of their&apos;  foreign exports.Lord D&apos;Abemon stated that the Germand were anxious that,as part of the general settlement, some concession should bemade to them in the matter of the return of a portion of theiimercantile marine, and also that some more economical arrange-ment should be reached respecting the cost of the Army ofOccupation.With regard to the latter, the Cabinet were reminded thatthe high cost&apos;per head was due to the excessive charges madefor the American troops.    Great Britain mas - quite prepared tobring her costs down to the French scale if .the americans would do the same.   For Great Britain to reduce her charges to the French scale, leaving the Americans1 as at present, waS^ut rf the question. But any relief obtained by a general reduction would in effect be making a present to Belgiumr&quot;Atng tc herpriority for repar-.t1.-r. up&apos; tc &apos;  1C0,CC0,CCC.The Cabinet took note of lord^Aherhon&apos;s report.
j/.rMPrTTTS FOR        (5)   In connection with the above disou&amp;location on Repara-i^hman fris-;:IFRS. tion, .reference was made to the fact that a sum of  750,000had to be handed by Great Britain to Germany in respect ofpayments due to individual Geman.prisoners, and it wassuggested that this payment shmuld in some way or other bebrought into the Reparation Account.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that thepayments were made under one of the Hague Conventions. thathe understood that the French Government had made their pay-ments t* Germany, and that there was no power under theTreaty of Versailles or otherwise to withhold money due to private persons0The Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellr r of the exchequer should make further enquiry, with aview to seeing whether any arrange-ment was possible whioh would obviatea cash payment being made to germany in respect of this service.
^StogN referencs t0 Gabi&quot;et 72 (20), Conclusion 4,0 advantage was taken of the presence of Lord DfAbernon andSir John Bradbury for a short discussion on the&quot; question of austrian Reparation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat certain proposals had been received from the FrenchGovernment for dealing with the serious financial situationin Austria.    These proposals amounted in effect to conferringmore extensive powers of control on the Reparation Commission,the creation of a special Bank of issue, and the giving offive years&apos; credit on Austria, either from Governments or frominternational banks.It was  tinted out that, in the absence of some pfovi-sion, there was every prospect that within the next few monthsAustria would in all probability -break tip, and that there wouldbe a general scramble among the neighbouring States for herremains.   Moreover, Vienna had long been the- banking centre ofSouthern Central .Europe, and any collapse on a large scalemust have widespread effects.The French proposals did not commend themselves to theCabinet, and it was generally agreed that a reply should besent to the French to the effect that it appeared to HisMajesty&apos;s Government that the scheme recently approved by theLeague of Rations at their Geneva meeting offered a better .reachinery for dealing with the situation in Austria than thatafforded by the Reparation Commission, and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be glad&apos;to learn how far the French.&apos; Governmentwould be prepared to go in freeing the assets of Austria from existing liens to the Allies, in order to facilitate such ascheme.In the event of franco agreeing with Great Britain to free the Austrian assets 1 in the manner proposed, it was thought probable that Italy, which was very directly concernedin the financial stability of Austria, would come into line.
]j0^LHTM^m       (?) With reference to Appendix IU(1), tho Cabinet wereReply from      informed &quot;that.....tixr-BmergerKr/&quot;-G.Qggpltt98 of..the..National Fodsra-the BuildingTrades Unions ..t ion of Building Trade Operatives had met on December 29tinto consider the Government scheme for the &quot;augmentation&quot; oflabour in the building industry, and had reported the propos-als to a full meeting of the Executives of the affiliatedUnions which was being held in London today, December 30th.It was hoped that some reply would be received from theExecutive   to lay before the meeting of the Cabinet on the morning of Friday, December 31st.
flLI^of       ^ r8ferenCO t0 0abinet 77 (20K Conclusion 5, theUNEMPLOYMBN T. Cabinet had under consideration Memoranda by the Minister -of-(a) Short        Labour (Paper C.P.-2375) and the Civil Lord of the AdmiraltyTime m &apos; Jthe Pock- (Paper CP.-2381), dealing with Short Time in the Dockyardsyards. &apos; J       *from which it appeared that at a meeting of the AdmiraltyIndustrial Council, held on December 29th, the scheme devisedby the Admiralty, as set out in the memoranda in question, hadbeen accepted by the Trade Union side of the Council, troughwith some considerable demur.The Cabinet approved the action taken bythe Admiralty in this matter, and requested the Civil Lord to convey to the Trade union side of the Admiralty Industrial Council theCabinetfs appreciation of their action in accepting the scheme in question.Short Time at The Cabinet were informed of the great difficulties of woolwich-.applying a short-time system at Woolwich.    This could only bedone by the adoption of the three-shift system, and in anycase it would be necessary to keep pivotal men and the estab-lishment staff on full time.   Woolwich -already had&apos;more menthan were needed, end it would be a serious matter to have totake on outside unskilled labour.    It was pointed out, on theother hand, that the primary object of the Unemployment Com-mittee was not to take on more new men at Woolwich, but toprevent discharges and, if possible, provide employment forthe 2,000 ex Arsenal employees who had been discharged inthe last few months.In the course of further discussion the Prime minister made a special appeal to Sir James Stevenson to assist inthe solution of this difficulty, and it was agreed -
ft&apos;Thati under the general authority ofthe Secretary of State for War, sir james Stevenson should have discretion to make such arrangements at Woolwichas would stop discharges and provide employment tor as many of the ex Arsenalunemployed men as the general position at woolwieh justified.&apos;i) Short Time The Minister cf Transport explained to the Cabineten the Rail-ways. the present position as regards employment en the railways,from which it appeared that, as regards the shop-men, shorttiros would have tc be worked in any ease, owing to the factthat the arrears of repairs were being, rapidly overtaken.The shops could absorb their own   unemployed, but could do no more.   With regard to the traffic workers, practically no over-time was being worked, save in special cases wherea man could not get back to his station without over-time.It was impracticable to give unskilled unemployed the Sundayduty which could only be carried out by the regular employees.It was agreed  That the Minister of Transport should arrange with the Railway Companies to mitigate the situation by absorbing as many of their unemployed workmen aspracticable.

appendix      I..LETTER TO EMPLOYERSbyPRE PRESIDENT P.F., TEB BOARD OF TRADE.In view of the depression of trade which prevails inmany places at the present time, the Government are anxious that the existing volume of work should be shared to the widest extent possible among the whole body of the wage-earning classes,,In some industries the practice of working short time   withthe object of providing employment for a larger number of people, is well-established;    in others the nature of theindustry may make any such arrangement difficult;   but theGovernment feel that much can be done by employers ingeneral to alleviate distress by distributing the existingopportunities for employment among as many as possible ofhheir employees, so that the largest numbers may be enabled to earn a portion of their usual wages.A system of short time may enable employers not only to spread their work for a longer time over the existing numberof their employees, but also to give employment to some whohave already been discharged,..The Government therefore ash that all employers should consider at once what re-arrangements can be made to givepartial employment to the maximum number of workpeople.   Itwill probably be found in many cases that the question can best be approached in consultation with the Trades Unionconcerned,, on whose co-operation the Government feel confi-dent they can rely0It is hoped that no time will be lost in taking the necessary -sary steps.   The Government are proposing the application ofthis principle in the Royal Dockyards and other Naval Fstab-lishments, and have planned to do all that Government can do to provide in various ways for those who are out of work, butthey look to employers and their workpeople to do what^they canto keep the number of wholly unemployed as low as possible.
APPENPIX    ,11.PRESS&quot;The Cabinet has decided that as far as possible all theindustrial establishments of the Government shall be placedfri sh^rt time in order to provide employment for the greatest possible number of workpeople, both to avoid further reductions in the establishment and to  absorb some of those whose employ-ment has been terminated,,    The Government are also askingemployers of labour throughout tho country (including LocalAuthorities as well as commercial undertakings) to take asimilar course rather than to reduce the number employed bydismissals.An appeal is being made to the Trade Unions to co-operate in this endeavour to tide over the period of trade depression.It is hoped by this means to spread the amount of -work avail-able over the largest number of people and thereby not onlyavoid further discbarges but also to make it possible for someof those who have been paid cff to be re-engaged.

LETTER from the Winter nf Labour to theBUIIDIM TRADES OPERATIVES.I have received your request of December I7ih. that theproposals of the Government should be/communicated in writingrather than at a Conference, as I proposed to you on December15th, . I therefore send you the : proposals of the Government,.1. The arrears in suitable housing accommodation, due inpart to the reduction in building before the s7ar, and gravelyaggravated by the total cessation of building during the War,constitute a serious hardship, particularly upon the workingclasses themselves.    The situation is accentuated by the factthat the number of skilled men in the Building Trades.is very considerably less than before the War, so that not only isthe number less than would be needed to meet the normalbuilding requirements of the country, but it is wholly inade-quate to overtake the very large volume of arrears with whichthe oountry is confronted.    Side by side with these undoubtedfacts there are tens of thousands of young. active ex-Servicemen,to whom the country rests under the most profound obliga-tion, ready and willing to engage-upoe productive work, askingwork and not charity, and finding themselves without theopportunity of earning that decent subsistence to which their services to the country in the hour of its necessity soabundantly entitle them.2. The Government is of opinion, therefore, that the absorp-tion into the Industry of a large body of ex-Service men asadult apprentices or trainees with a view to becoming skilledcraftsmen should be commenced forthwith.    The numbers to be absorbed should be on the basis of one in five calculated onthe number of skilled.men in the whole industry, but theproportion must vary in different trades.   Tho highest per-centoges should be applied to the three branches of theindustry where the need is greatest, namely, Bricklayers,Slaters&apos; a^d Tilers, and Plasterersand the minimum numberof men thus admitted to the skilled crafts, for housing pur-poses shall be not less than&apos; SO^OCO,   The proportions to beadmitted in the various crafts above specified will be .arranged with the Minister of Labour,.    3, In return for an undertaking to admit and train theseex-Servic6 men, the Government is prepared to make a TrainingGrant of  5 per head to the Unions for each man admitted tothe Trade Unions concerned and trained in any of the trades irthe Building Industry,   This grant will be paid as followsi-flS on admission to training,, 5 at the completion of the training.Men actually appointed as instructors of the new entrantswill be rated stnd paid as leading hands * -4* The Government accept the principle of a guaranteedrate of pay oh housing operations for time lost owing to wetand inclement weather,&quot; sublet to the Trade Unions accepting the augmentation set out in -paragraph-8? . and.are prepared tcprovide for the application on Housing Schemes of this principle on the following basis&quot;, viz.:-
&quot;In the case of a man employed, or standing by to work on a job when called upon., for &quot;afull week-, the payment for time lost throughstress of weather shall be 50 per cent., in&quot;respect of time lost up to 22 hours per week.In the case of time lost in excess of 22hours.., the hours lost over and above 22 hoursshall be paid for at tho rate of 75 per cent,of the tire rate&quot;e5, Trie Government appreciate the anxiety with whichBuilding Trade Operatives view the prospect of considerableadditions to the membership of their craft.    In the years immediately before the War, and mainly in consequence of thereduction in the number of houses built, as described in thefirst paragraph of this letter, the Building Trades were subject to frequent and grave periods of unemployment, with allthe hardships entailed to the families of the workers.    Havingregard, however, to the great arrears of Building  &apos;-ork through-out the country -- arrears which must be made good at theearliest possible opportunity -  and to the admitted shortage in the number of skilled men in the Building /Trades as corn-pared with the pre-ear days, the Government are of opinionthat no risk of unemployment is involved in their proposals.If, however, their confidence is not shared by the Unions,it is within the power of the industry as a whole to provide against this oontihgeney.    An amended Unemployment InsuranceAct has been placed upon the Statute Book this year.   ThatAct provides a Benefit of 15/- a week which, if the TradeUnion cares to become the agency for administration, becomesat least 20/- a week by an additional contribution of atleast 5/- a week from Trade Union Funds9The Training Grants mentioned in Paragraph S above wouldpro^id^ -a substantial foundation for any addition which theUnions may desire to make to the provision under the Insur-ance Aet06.1 shall be glad if you will place this communicationbefore your Executive;    and, in view of the pressing urgency of the matter, the Government desires me to ask for a replyby the end of the year.
