IRELAND0With reference to Cabinet 77 (80), Conclusion 6, Generaldacready. General Strickland, General Boyd,h General Tudorand Sir John Anderson attended the Conference to express their opinions regarding the present state of affairs inIreland,General Strickland, Commanding the Cork area where martial law had been proclaimed, stated that he had not yet receivedany report regarding the number of arms which had been surrender-dered.   The last day on which they could be handed in wasDecember 37th.   His opinion was that the loyalisIs would fallin with the order, but that the majority of the extremistswould bury their arms.    As time went on the military might beable to ascertain where these arms had been buried.    referring to the raid by the Police at a dance in Limerick, where 138men had been captured and 5 armed sentries who were standingoutside the hall had been shot. General Strickland said that so far he had only received a telegraphic report of what had happened from the Brigadier in charge.   As far as he couldascertain there were no women present at the dance, and inall probability it was in reality a conference for/future operations.    All those captured, were now in prison.General Macready said that, generally speaking, the situa-tion, from a military point of view, was improving.    the internment camps were going on satisfactorily, although therewas rather a shortage of accommodation.   He was convinced that.ieverything was satisfactory in the Cork area, and he had now made an application to the Castle for an extension of themartial law area.   He would&apos; like Kilkenny, Glare, Waterford andWexford all under martial law.   It would not be necessary toapply martial law to its full effect, but it,helped themilitary in their work and was welcomed in many cases by theinhabitants.General Tudor said that from the Police point of view theposition had improved..   There were now plenty of men to hold Jthe Police barracks.   IS Auxiliary Companies were now formed,-1-
and the transport situation was much improved.    Further, he hoped to have 80 armoured cars by the end of January.    Themortal of the Police during the last six months had made amarked advance.   Six months ago the Police were living behindsandbags and wire entanglements, they were boycotted, andlife was altogether intolerable;    but now things were quite different and they could move about freely, and with theexception of ambushes they were practically out of danger.Some discussion then took place regarding co-operationbetween the Military and the Police.    It was stated that/asaregards discipline and administration, the Police in themartial law area were under General Strickland.   As for easesof indiscipline which were tried before a military court-martial, a sentence of dismissal would be carried out byGeneral Tudor, and a capital charge would come under GeneralStrickland,   In answer to a question, it was stated thatGeneral Strickland had the power to order the Royal irish constabulary out of his area should he consider it necessary.Operations General Strickland was responsible for, though hehad a District Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary onhis Staff,    The Police, however, acted on their own initiativeif they received special information, the area being a verylarge one.General Strickland stated that so far there had been nofriction between the two Forces, and at the present moment he saw no likelihood of it.    If friction did arise, it would onlybe through lack of discipline.   General Strickland added thatno-eae f :11fsueTl^^General.Some discussion then followed regarding the arrest by theMilitary or Police authorities, without reference- to theChief Secretary, of people of political importance.The Prime Minister said that if a man like Arthur Griffith,who was well known, was arrested, it at once became &amp; politic-al event, and in the whole history of Ireland an arrest of
that kind had not keen made without the sanction of theChief Secretary.   One of the difficulties in connection withMartial law was that it meant the passing of the adminiatratiorout of the hands of those&apos;responsible to Parliament.    Thereshould be greater co-ordination between military and politicaloffices.General Boyd stated that Arthur Griffith was arrested onhas order.    He did not consult the Chief Secretary becausethe latter was not there.    He had, however, asked the Under-Seeretary, in the event of there being murders in Dublin, ifhe could arrest the leading members of Dail Eireann.    he added that if the arrest of Arthur Griffith had not takenplace there might have been murders.   As there was a good dealof anger amongst the regimental officers at that time hethought it advisable to arrest some of the leading men afterwhat had happened,Mr Churchill interposed that it was fair to remember thatno reprisals had taken place after the Dublin murders.The Prime Minister said that important arrests of that kind should be taken on the responsibility of the Cabinet.In decisions which had a political complexion the chief secretary should be consulted.    If, however, a man was guilty of actual crime and there was a prltna facie, case on a criminalcharge, that was a very different thing.The Prime Minister then said that all kinds of attempts hadbeen made at obtaining a truce, and when tho Cabinet came toconsider the policy of such a course they would have to bearin mind the possibility of an Incident happening which mightcreate unpleasantness with the United States, where feeling was dangerous.    The Cork incident and the murder of the Canoncame near to such a state of affairs.   Those were the kind of incidents that drove a country like the United States to do something beyond discretion.   If there was a chance of patch-ing up some kind of truce, were General Strickland and GeneralTudor confident that they could keep their men in hand?
3 ft 1ei1 (  1He (the Prime Minister) was afraid that there had been a gooddeal of drunkenness amongst the &quot;Black and Tans1&apos;.General Tudor admitted that drink was the problem withthe Auxiliary Divisions, but his Commanding Officers were ofthe&apos;opinion that they were new getting the men under bettercontrol.   Discipline generally, however,Macroom,after the outrage there, there had been notrouble at all.The discussion then passed to the Report of the Enquiry intothe Cork burnings, and it was stated that the Report would find that these burnings were carried out partly by the AuxiliaryPolice.   As regards the firing of the Town Hall, there wascircumstantial evidence against, four men of the Royal irish constabulary.    The opinion was expressed that the effect of publishing the Report if Parliament was sitting would be dis-astrous to the Government&apos;s whole policy in Ireland.The Chief Secretary said that he had read the whole report and not only a telegraphic version, and must say that GeneralStrickland had made a judicial commentary on the facts.Putting the case at its worst, members cf the *K&quot; Company ofthe Auxiliary Corps had set fire to three different shops as areprisal,   Another part of the Reporestated that the spread of the conflagration was due to the inadequacy of the fire brigade arrangements.General Tudor said, regarding the finding of the Report,that he thought it went into the discipline of the AuxiliaryCompany rather unnecessarily,/and that the.Report reflectedon him,, inasmuch as after the massacre at Mao room he had sent another platoon of Black and Tans to replace that whichhad been massacred.   This platoon was an experienced one, andreinforcements had to be sent down and no other reserves wereavailable.General Strickland said that, considering the state of thecountry and that 16 Black and Tans had been massacred, thecircumstances were enough to try the discipline of the best
troops.    Had he been in General Tudor1s place he would have asked for military assistance.Reference was then made to the discipline of the Army, andGeneral Macready said that he had made it clear that he wouldbreak any officer who was mixed up in reprisals;    this, not for the sake of Ireland, but for the sake of the Army.    he did not think it was possible to have the Police more disci-plinedj    they had no code to work under, and the officers werenot the standard of men who eou3d   enforce discipline.   the divisional Commissioners in the Police were of the rank &apos;&amp; Brigadier, and he knew from experience how difficult it wasto find a Brigadier in the Army suitable for the kind of work required in Ireland.The Prime Minister asked if a military officer (found&apos; aaagtin the martial law district a number of Policemen behavingnin an improper way, would the officer interfere with them?General Strickland replied that if the officer was in muftihe could not dofeuch, but if in uniform he would take steps andhave them put under arrest.General Tudor said that he thought the discipline of thePolice, considering the strain put upon them, was really good.Men who came into the Police Force said that the discipline in it was stricter than in the Army, and anyone who had seen the Black and Tans on parade must admit that their disciplinewas very fine;    they were entirely under the control of their officers.   At the present moment, perhaps, there were not as many non-commissioned officers as were necessary, but this wasbeing remedied.The Prime Minister hoped that General Tudor would realise the importance of preventing such incidents as would add tothe difficulties of the Government, and asked that GeneralTudor would investigate and deal strongly with any case ofindiscipline.   He put this to General Tudor not because he did not appreciate the fine work which he and the men underhim had done, but in order to try and prevent further
incidents of the kind.The Prime Minister then said that there were two questionsof a semi-political character which he would like to put toGeneral ifeeready and the other officers.   As was known,conversations in regard to a truce had been going on, and itwas suggested that there should be a cessation of strife,without, however, any arrangement as to final terms. Whatwas General wacready&apos;s opinion regarding a truce without the surrender of arms by the Sinn Peiners as a condition of sucha truce, end was it worth while having a truce of that kind?General Macready said that, regarding the surrender ofarms, he presumed that his opinion was that of a GeneralOfficer Commanding who was responsible for the safety of hismen.    Prom that point of view, if there was a cessation ofoutrages on the part of the Sinn Peiners for a month, therewould equally be a cessation by the military of raiding.   Tiedanger with troops was that it was always difficult to keep them on the alert for something that might happen.    If it wasadvisable from a political appointed of view that such a truceUb-should take place, the risk of effect? on the Army might beminimised, and a truce would not, in his opinion, have anyye ry g re at d rawba cks.The Prime Minister said that he did not know that such a truce would necessarily lead to a settlement, but it might lead to the abandonment of lawlessness. The question was whether General Ifecready thought he could step lawlessnesswithout a surrender of arms?   Michael Collins bad said that be could not get his men to surrender their arms even if hetried.   If the Sinn Peiners were to stop murdering, what could the military stop in return?General Macready said they could stop raiding, searchingand arresting persons other than those against whom therewas a definite charge.   By stopping these things, however,the Intelligence machinery would go slower and slower, andif the campaign against the Sinn Feiners was over resumed
the military would find themselves at a disadvantage, as the extremists would have had time to put up a new organisation.The Prime Minister asked if the Sinn Feiners realised thatthey had made a miscalculation?General Soyd said that in his opinion the extreme na^tvwas determined to go on, and he would not like to say thatthey knew they were beaten.    Our policy had been very effect -ive, and if there was a truce now the time would be used bythe murder party to re-organise themselves, and they wouldcertainly regard a truce as a sign of weakness. . The Govern-ment would certainly be the losers if the campaign was resumed&apos;&apos;.Sir John Anderson said that when this question was raised,some time ago he was of the opinion that the success of anattack on Sinn Fein depended on the break-up of their central organisation.   At Sinn Fein headquarters there was no doubtthat they were now badly disorganised, and if there was a truce it. would have the effect of enabling them tc re-establistjtheir central organisation.    This would be a great misfortuneHe was not at all convinced that it was possible to get a truce observed by the other side,- a condition of which wasthat they did not resume activities which were to be suspendedlAnother point which the military had not mentioned was theefforts of Sinn Fein to undermine local government, and theExecutive were now beating them on this,   lie thought, however,that everything depended on the line it was possible to getthe Church to take.    If, during a lull, the Roman Catholichierarchy came out in strong condemnation of murder and out-rage , he thought that a truce would be worth while.   As forthe attitude of the leaders, tt4a was that they would fightuntil they dropped.   They would not admit that they werebeaten.   They were men who were kept going by despair, andthe forlorn hope that there would be reactions in thiscountry.Mr Bonar law said that there were two things a trucemight result in:   first, it might have a discouraging effect
on our troops;   and, second, the Sinn Feiners might use thelull for intense propaganda.in this country regarding thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Ireland.The question arose as to whether, during a truce, it wouldbe possible to arrest people like Michael Collins, and theopinion was expressed that if this -was done the other side would accuse the Government of breaking the trace.General Tudor, asked for his opinion, said he agreed withGeneral Boyd and Sir John Anderson.   The interval would un-doubtedly be used by the Sinn Feiners to re-establish theirsystem of communication throughout the country.    If murdererswere still to be arrested it would not be possible to have a truce.The Prime Minister then asked,if there was no truce, how long they thought it would be before the extremist gang of the sinn Peiners was entirely broken?   The Horne Rule Act might come into operation any time in February, and the North was anxious to get it working at once..  It would be very awkwardto do this, however, without putting It into operation in theSouth as well.    Sinn Pein was against the Act, and he wouldlike the opinion cf the Military Officers as to what would happen If there was an election in the South of Ireland, say,in February and March:   would there be any intimidation?General B6*cready said he thought that if an election washeld in February or March there would be a general boycottat the point cf the pistol, on the word of Michael Collins. -The Prime Minister observed that if Michael Collins couldatop three million people using their vote, it did not saymuch for the success of the policy His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas ne* pursuing.General Maeready said that he thought the terror would be broken if martial law was spread all over the country.General Strickland was of opinion that there would bedefinite and- decisive results in four months&apos; time.   asked if there would be sufficient terrorism to prevent voters from
voting and candidates from standing, General Stricklandreplied in the negative.General Tudor said that he thought that,in his area, in four months&apos; time&apos;the terror would be broken if there was notruce.   The great hope of the extremists was a change ofpolicy.General Boyd said he thought that four months was not too optimistic a prophecy, speaking for Dublin, Heath and Wicklow.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that in hisopinion a truce would be absolutely fatal.    There was one party in Ireland which no-one had yet mentioned, and thatwas the decent peasant, who was nearly on the Government side,but if there was a truce would go over again bo the sinn feiners.   He thought that perhaps in six months&apos; time, if-military law was applied to the whole of Ireland, 80 per cent,or 00 per cent, of the people would be on the side of theGovernment.There was then a short discussion regarding the extensionof martial law to Kilkenny, Clare, Water ford and Wexford,but the Prime Minister said that he would first like to see how it worked in the Cork area.The discussion was then adjourned to4 p.m. on the following day, Thursday,December 30th.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,. December 39, 1920.
