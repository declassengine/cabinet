AK.IA&amp;ISTAN. (1) kith     fere nee to Cabinet 66 (20), Conclusion 3,the Cabinet agreed that  If the Secretary of State &quot;&quot;or Indiarequired further authority or consult-ation on points of detail in giving effect to the Government&apos; a policy arsregards Afghanistan, he should referdirect to the Fri e Minister, whowould use his discretion as to whetherthe -ratter was of sufficient irrport-ance to bo brought before the Cabinet.
t .HE&quot;&apos; AftRI-TOLTURE   (2) With reference t* the Conclusions of a Conference cfILL.Ministers, held on May 19, 1920 (Paper C.P.-1313), tho cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor ef the exchequer-quer.(Paper d*.PV-2247) and a Memorandum by th- Secretary forScotland (Papbr G0Vh-Z2 Z) dealing with.the .Governmentrsliability under the Agriculture Sill now before the Houseof L&amp;rds, .The Chancellor ef the Exchequer,  in his Memorandum,directed the attention of the Cabinet.tn the liability whichrn.ight.be incurred under the Bill in respect of the guaranteedminimum prices for wheat, and especially f^r tats, in thelight of the present tendency of prices.    The guaranteedQtT minimum price for oata for the standard year 1919 was 42s,3d.por statutory quarter.    This price was subject to adjustment in each year, according as the cost of production moved up on down.    It was estimated by the Treasury that the guaranteedprifte for 1921   the first year in which the guaranteeoperates      was likely to be net less than 51/- per statutoryquarter.    If, as new seemed probable, the price of oats fell10/- a quarter below the. guaranteed price, the exchequer wouldbe call d upon to pay in 1922-23 to the farmers, on the basisof the 1919 acreage, about  12,000^000^ and this might rise to l5se00,0GD if the prospect of the subsidy induced farmers totransfer land from wheat to oats.     In tho case of wheat, ifthe guaranteed price for 1921 were round about BO/&apos;-- per quarter, the Exchequer might be involved in a subsidy efabout  60,00.0-OOG a year. -The Cabinet were reminded that the main object of theGovernment&apos;s policy had been to increase the supplies of f--odproduced at home, but that, owing to the disproportionaterates at which the cereals were guaranteed, the net result might in fact be to diminish the amount cf wheat grown.It was pointed but * on the other hand, that the
minimum prices, coupled with tho control of cultivation, andthat it was impossible at this stage to retreat fror; thosespecific pledges.    Further, the prices, in the AgricultureBill were based upen the findings n.f the Royal Corliss ionen Agriculture, whs had examined a number *f expert witnesseson the subject.&apos;   Consequently, any departure from the prices would be regarded as a serious breach of faith by the farming community.    The wheat which would he harvested in 19,81 hadalready been sown, with the exception *f next year&apos;s springwheat, which would not be more than about 5 per cent, ff thet*tal crop and could only affect the subsidy for oats to theextent of about  200,000.    Further., the Ministry of Agricul-and the Board of Agriculture for Beetlandture/contested the estimate of 51/- advanced by the Treasury.In their opinion the cost of production would be substantially less, and might net differ ouch from that for 1920, owing tothe fall in the price of manures and seeds.At this stage the Cabinet hearl the views of&quot;Mr Paul,if the Oheat Commission, on the probable course of wheatprices in 1021 and their effect upon the amount of Governmentsubsidies.    In Mr Paul&apos;s opinion it was improbable that thecourse of wheat prices would involve the Government in thepayment of a subsidy:   but in the ease of oats it was highly-probable that a subsidy would be required.    English eatscould niw be bought at about 50/- per customary quarter, andthe ?rice might very well fall to SO/- or 35/-.    In the easeof wheat, he thought -the Ivwost point would be reached early next yearBThe&apos;Cabinet wore reminded that the Agriculture bill was concerned not only with guaranteed prices but with security for the farmers and with the exercise of controlover cultivation by the State, and that It was quite pos-sible that the Bill, before it reached its final stages,would be very much mutilated.    In that eventuality it mightbe necessary for the Cabinet to review their attitude notonly to the Clauses dealing with guaranteed prices, but to
the rest -0** the Bill.    It was, -therefore, undesirable troach a definite conclusion on *ne element in - the fillwithout regard to the fate-of the Bill as a whole.The Cabinet agreed    - \To postpone the cons!^ oration of the guaranteed orices spe- ified in theBill until the attituie o^ the Lor isand the Commons to tie Bill as awh^le had become clearer.(3) Arising out of tl.e preceding discussion,  the atten-tibn -0f the Cabinet was drawn to an Amendment which hadbeen proposed in the Prase o^ Lords, the Ybject of whichwas to exclude Ireland from the operations of the Agricul-ture Bill,    It was pointed out that if the Home Rule Billbecame lav:, TPis Majesty&apos;s Government would be unable toexercise direct control over cultivation in Ireland, whileif Ireland remained in the Agriculture Bill the imperial exchequer would have to provide any necessary subsidy.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Agriculture shouldtake the line that while the Governmentwould prefer the Agriculture Bill u-e itstood9 they would net resist an AraerKbentexcluding Ireland from its operations.
(4) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War on the prevision of shipping forthe movement of prisoners in Ireland (Paper C.P.-2266) .The Cabinet were info mod that over 1,000 leading members **f the Sinn Fein organisation had been interned,with beneficent results on the state       order in Ireland.The Irish gaola were now full, and an internment camp hadbeen arranged in Ulster.    It was essential that large numbersfrh&amp;uld %e moved thither by sea.    There was a strong objectionte; the use of merchant ships, owing to the rish of mutinyairing the Intei&apos;ned persons, and strikes among the crews.The Secretary of State for War and the Chief Secretaryfor Ireland pressed strongly that the Admiralty should allowmen-of-war to be utilised.The Cabinet were then informed that the admiralty had been appro ached **n the subject on December 10th, and had at once given the necessary ins ructions to the officers concerned to render ev^ry possible.assistance.   Severalwarships were now available.The Cabinet took note of the intentionef the Admiralty to render every possi-blo assistance.
iSPPlfflJ (5) With reference to Cabinet 63 (20), Conclusion 3   theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Shipping Con-troller (Paper C.P,-2106)  raising the question of whether we should exercise *ur right under paragraph 5 of Annex III,Af Part VIII hf the Peace Treaty t/compel Germany to buildmerchant ships in German yards for the account of the allied and Associated Governments in the five years after the cominginto force of the Treaty.    The British share of the first year&apos;a building would be about 100,000 tons gross.    In theview of the Shipping Controller, His Majesty&apos;s Government:,if it were necessary for the Allies as a whole- to make anycencesslan to Germany in the matter of shipping reparation,should forego the right to have ships built In Germany.,    Onthe other hand, if it were likely that the French and Italianswould insist rn a strict enforcement of the Treaty, then HisMajesty&apos;s Government ought to press for the British share oftonnage *In the course of the discussion it was pointed outthat there was at present more than an ample supply of british shipping to meet current demands, or any dec-anas likely to bewade in the near future.   It was also suggested that thematter was one which might conveniently be discussed at thaConference which it was proposed to hold, at Geneva afterthe Brussels Conference.The Cabinet agreed --That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should communicate with the FrenchGovern: ant, with a view to ascertainingtheir views on the d-sirability or otherwise of exorcising the rights of the Allies inrespect **.f the building/)ships by theGermans under the Treaty,/
(6) The Cabinet agreed or., the. following arrangements formeetincrg of the Cabinet or Conferences of&apos;Ministers asregards future business:-Friday..December ,17thv 11-5Q a,m, : -(1) The Condition of Austria.(2) Our American Debt.(3) Mes o po tamia.(4) Unemployment  (if time permits)*  .Monday, December 20th,  12 Noon:--(l) The King&apos;S Speech.(2) Unemployment (if not dealt with on Friday)Tuesday-., December gJ3t,  1.1-30 arm. :-Cabinet Committee on Finance, toconsider Army and Air Estimates,-    1921-22.(?) With, reference to Conclusion 1 of a Conference ofMinisters held at 9 p.m. on December 15,  1920,  the Cabinetfurther considered the situation which would arise if the amendments of the House of Lords, dealing wxth the SuspensoryClause and the Appointed Day, were accepted, and were inform-ed of the result of the negotiations which, had taken place since the Conference held on the previous evening.A suggestion was put forward that in the event of thefirst election of the Southern Parliament proving abortiveand Crown ColOny government being set up,  there should notbe held a second election without a Resolution of bothHouses of the Imperial Parliament.The Cabinet agreed  That, in view of the Government&apos;s willingness to make concessions in regard to  (a)  the Senates,fb)  the Surtax,(c) the bi-cameral Parliament,it-was undesirable at this stage to make further concessions in regard to the Lords&apos;&apos;Amendments to the Suspensory Clause and theAppointed Day.
