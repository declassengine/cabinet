(1)        0***&quot;.t hadbsfcr. ther, tho following. Papers onthe subject of Government Land Valuation:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of state or v^ar and minister of Munitions (Pap*rlAemoranda by the Chancellor of theT&apos;xch quer (Papers 0.1.-2223 andC.P.-2302).lord Peel stated that the Secretary of State for War,who was unable to be present, had intended to circulate aMemorandum dealing with the Chancellor of the ExchequersMemoranda, but had been unable to do so before the meetingof the Cabinet.    In the view of the -var Office,  the work of valuation and of buying and selling factories, buildings and land, oumht to be concentrated in one Department,    That De-partment oubhi not to be the Inland Revenue Department   but should preferably be the Of-rice of -orbs.    There was net onlythe&quot; immediate problem of clearing up the arrears due to the&quot;Var, but there was beyond that the permanent problem of valuation of property and negotiation for purchase and sale.Th^ problems raised by the bar would take at least three years to settle.-    In the view of the War Office- it was desirds lethat the work of valuation should be done by an impartial body which was not interested in raising money by taxation fromthe properties valued.Sir Howard Frank, the Chairman of the Disposals Hoard,concurred generallv in the views put forward by Lord Peel,and urged that it was impracticable to assign the work of valuation to one Department and the work of purchase and sale to another.    The work should be concentrated under one Ministerfor in that way it would be more economically done, and itwould be possible to retain the services of experienced surveysors who had boon assisting the Lands Directorate&apos; hitherto,but who objected to being transfsrr-d to the Inland RevenueValuation Department, against which there was strong profes-sional prejudice.    The work still outstanding, involved
milllon9 0f mone^ ar&apos;d raised many legal. difficulties which,in the. opinion of-some, might delay its completion for aslong as ten years, though he himself hoped it might be finished in a much shorter period.(Sir Howard Frank, having stated his vie-sand Mr B.H.Coles, Comptroller of Lands;    &apos;withdrew.) . &apos;In the course o^ the discussion which followed, highappreciation was expressed of the work which had been doneby the Inland Revenue Valuation Department on behalf of theMinistry of Health, the Cffi.ee of Works and other Government-Departments, and it was held to be very undesirable to dis--turb the organisation now in being.    On the other hand, inview of the growing responsibility of the State for landedproperty, and the alleged defects in the present administra-tiwn of Crown lands, it was thought that further investigation into these questions was advisable.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That all valuation work for the Government(except that connected with certain wartransactions) should be concentrated in one department and that that Department shouldbe the Inland Revenuei as recommended bythe Committee on Mational Expenditure,the Public Accounts Committee, the FirstLord of the Admiralty, the Minister ofHealth, the First Commissioner of Works-,and others %(b) That the Inland Revenue should not beresponsible for purchase and sale ormanagement of lands, etc&quot;.(c) That the Prime Minister should appoint aCommittee to examine the question of con-cent rating in one Department all government purchases and sales of land and buildings and the management of the estates of tneCrown and Government property.
Cabinet considered, as a matter of urgency; the presentposition of the Russian tirade negotiations, in view of anundertaking which had been given that no Agreement would be concluded without the House of Commons having an opportunityto discuss its terms.The President of the Board of Trade said that, onaccount of the approaching prorogation of Parliament, he proposed to make a statement that afternoon in the House ofCommons, outlining the course of the trade negotiations withthe Soviet Government,    He proposed to deal ^ith three orfour of the main points-which had been at issue.    The easier- of the negotiations had been the comrmirLic-ati^n--made- by HisMajesty&apos;-s Government on June 20th, -   M. Krassih had objected,ganda.     to a detailed reference being made to the ooxmtrios in whichthe folsheviks were alleged to be carrying on propaganda.   Wehad mentioned Afghanistan,  India, Persia and the Caucasus ascountries where hostile propaganda must be abandoned,   M.Krassin had disputed our right to include the Caucasus, onthe ground that it was a part of the former Russian Empire,and he (Sir Robert Horne),  after consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, did net intend tooress *or sped fie mention of the Caucasus.   With regard todebts, the Government&apos;s policy had been to postpone thegeneral question, to be determined at a subsequent PeaceConference, but to insist on the Soviet Government recognisingcertain types of debts at once.    The phrase used in the &quot;JulyAgreement&quot; had been * &quot;That the Soviet Government, in return for acorresponding undertaking from the BritishGovernment,&quot; agrees to recognise in principlethat it is liable to pay compensation to private citizens who have supplied goods or services to Russia for which they have notbeen paid&quot;.An attempt had been made to get U. Kraasin to accept a merecomplete definition of Soviet obligations, but he had refused&quot;
to deparb from.....td^rigi^ : The-mattsr was &quot;a  &apos;Somewhat academic one,,and there iouid.be no settlement..ofdebts until the meeting of the Political Conference.    In his*wn &apos;3ir ^bert Home&apos;3) view, the original phraaa.waa,OTra-SovietCient. The only means which the/Government at presentpossessed for making payment for goods obtained here wasgold.    If gold came to this country it would be arrested byPrltish creditors, and the matter would be taken to theCourts.    This danger; in hi. Krassin&apos;s view, would make tradeimpossible.    He therefore asked that we should pass legisla-tion making it impossible for British creditors to attach the gold.    In the view of the Law Officers  (in which sir robert Home concurred) the conclusion of the Trade agreement would be tantamount to recognising the Soviet Government as ade fact?1, Government,, and that would have a very important bearing on the view taken by the Courts. . In any case we coulcnot agree to interfere with the Courts in the way proposedby **. Krassih.    Further&apos;, M. Krassin demanded the right tore-export Russian gold received into this country.    At preserrgeld was bought at the Mint price of about 85/-, whereas thehigherworld price was about 40/-yper ounce.     In the view of theTreasury and of the Bank of England it was important to main-tain complete control over the export of gold.    On the. otherhand, it would probably be difficult at present to secure a market for Russian gold outside Europe.    In any case, he didnot intend to refer&apos;to this point of licences for gold in his statement that afternoon.    The President of the Board of Tradecontinuing, said there were other minor matters involved int*v* Agreement, such as the setting, up of the ordinary agencies of trade, the exchange of documents, and so forth. &quot;He as memfor the authority of the Cabinet to make a statement on the , ;jlines which he had indicated.
In the- -KJ-o-ur&amp;e-of-&quot;ihe^disestur^^ence was made to the Conclusions arrived at by the Cabinet onNovember 26, 1020 (Cabinet 64 (20), Conclusion 3)&apos;, and parti-cularly to the covering letter which was to be handed to M.Krassln on the exchange of documents concluding any agreement reached.The President of the hoard of Trade stated that&apos;he andLord Curzon had not been able to meet to draft the covering&apos;letter, and,as agreement had not yet been reached,- the time had not come for handing such, a letter to Oh Krassln.-   In thenegotiations which had proceeded, and particularly at a Confer-ence held on the previous evening between Mj Krassin and thePrime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal, the interpretationput upon the Agreement by the Cabinet had been made perfectlyplain,,The view was expressed that at present the conclusionof an Agree;;:ent was improbable-,, and the Cabinet were unani-meusly of opinion that if the negotiations broke down it was desirable they should fail on an issue like hostile propaganda,which could be popularly understood, rather than on more tech-nieal questions affecting the payment of debts and the sale ofgold.The Cabinet authorised the President of theBoard of Trade to make a statement in theHouse of Commons on these lines.
(3) The Cabinet concurred in the proposal wade by thePrime Minister that Ministers should be available for cabinet Meetings up to the end of next week, in view of theimportant and urgent character of certain outstanding problora,such as Ireland and Unemployment.    After that date it waahoped that there might be an adjournment for a few weeks.It was arranged that there should be ameeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence on Thursday morning, December23rd, at 11-30, and a meeting of theCabinet on Thursday afternoon at 4 p.ns. ,after which there would be an adjourn-inent until tbm- following Tuesday.CO^RRHCRS (4) The Cabinet took note of the Conclusions of theOP MINISTERS;following Conferences of Ministers(a) Conference of Ministers held on December15, 1920, at 11-50 a,m.(1) Housing.

HOUSING RING FENCE SCHEMES.



1. Sir L. Worthington-Evans as Chairman of the Unemployment Committee stated to the Conference that he had been asked by that Committee to refer back for further consideration the decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet 66 (20) Conclusion 4) that no offer of a Government contribution is aid of unemployment insurance should be made to the Building Trade Unions, but that ring fence schemes should be immediately procceded with ex-service men put to work upon them and trainers obtained on such terms as would induce them to join.

At a meeting of the Unemployment Committee following on the above decision the Minister of Health had called attention to the fact that the ring fence schemes would have to be put into operation by Local Authorities and that none of the Local Authorities would agree to putting ex-service men on housing work without the consent of Trade Unions. Representatives both o the L.C.C. and the Corporation of the City of London had been subsequently interviewed in order to see whether anything could be done. No definite reply had been given by the L.C.C. but it was probable that the scheme could only be passed through the Council with difficulty. On the other hand the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the City Corporation had stated that his Committee would agree to starting a ring fence scheme at Ilford for 2,000 houses, and that there would be no difficulty with the contractor.

It was pointed out on the other hand that if the contractor realised that he was the only one to undertake work on this basis he might not be ready to do it.

Sir L. Worthington-Evans also reported that certain proposals had been made by Mr. Easton, the Chairman of the Federation of Building Employers which he had made after consultation with some 20 of the leading builders of the country.

 
Mr. Easton had pointed out that the employers wanted a scheme of bonus on output, while on the other hand the Government wanted to the admission of ex-Service men into the building trade. The Government would be unable to fight the Unions without the assistance of the employers since there was enough work other than housing to absorb the whole trade. On the other hand the employers would be unable to make a stand without the assistance of the Government, who, with their housing programme, were the largest employers of building labour.

it was accordingly proposed that the Government should join hands with the building employers on an offer to the men of -

(1) A scheme of bonus on output over and above the standard rate of wages;

(2) the admission of ex-service man on building work all over the country in a proportion to be agreed;

(3) a special scheme under the Unemployment Insurance Act involving additional contributions of 6d. per man from the employers and 6d. from each workman which would produce an additional 15/- a w? unemployment benefit making 30/- in all.

It was proposed that the Government and the employers should make a stand on this offer and face a strike if such were inevitable.

It was pointed out to the Conferences that to insist upon a scheme of bonus on output would add to the difficulty of the Government by evoking strong opposition from the Trade Unions, that negotiations for bonus on output in the engineering trades wore now in progress, and that if a definite issue were raised on this in the building trade a Trade Union Congress would be summoned at once and a Resolution passed putting a step to any negotiations for bonus on output in any trade whatever. On the other hand it was suggested that as the minders had accepted payment by results and the engineers were discussing it, there was no reason why the building trade should not also discuss it, particularly as the Trade Unions were no longer in so Strong      
 a position as they had been.

At this stage attention was drawn to a letter from a representative builder (C.P.2294) to the effect that if the Government&apos;s scheme were to include a bonus on output a large number of the building employers would not stand firm and that it would be better to make a stand on the question of dilution. On the other hand it was urged that the employers did not want dilution since it involves the use of inexperienced labour and they would refuse to pay an extra insurance contribution unless they were compensated by some form of payment by results.

It was pointed out that the House of Commons were becoming very impatient at the delay and that a definite answer must be given to a question to be asked the same day by Sir William Davison.

"To ask the Minister of Labour, whether the negotiations with the building Trades Unions which have been in progress for the past 16 months to allow dilution so that at least 50,500 unemployed ex-service men may be employed in the building of urgently needed houses for the working classes have been completed; whether there are at least 65,000? fewer skilled men in the building industry than there were in 1914; and whether he will assure the House that, in the event of an agreement not being arrived at between the Government and the Trades Unions before the House rises, the Government will themselves take such stops as may be necessary to secure the employment of these men in the building of houses, especially having regard to the prevailing distress which is being occasioned by their prolonged unemployment by reason of trade union regulations which they have been unable to comply with owing to the fact that they were fighting for their Country".

The Conference felt that if the Local Authorities were unwilling to make a stand all the Government could do would be to express their willingness we help them to the best of their ability. The Government could not fight on bonus on output, they were not in a position to build themselves and all they would do was to support the Local Authorities.

The Minister of Labour, the Minister of Health, the Secretary for Scotland and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour thereupon withdrew to draft a suitable reply. Upon their return after some further discussion the Conference agreed to the following reply:-


I agree with, my Honourable Priend that in this veryurgent matrter-discussion has been long protracted,and that in view of the very serious unemployment,especially amongst ex-service men, tho natter must now be brought to a final conclusions   We aretherefore asking representatives of tho building trade Operatives to meet us on Monday next when woshall lay before them the definite end finalproposals of tho GrOvernmont*     Until we hoar theresult of that mooting I prefer not to say what action the Government will take in tho event ofrefusal.   But tho Government have come to thoconclusion that ne further delay in this matter ispossible^
2.     With reference to Cabinet 69(20), Conclusion 1,tho Conference considered certain - recommendations by the Committee on Unemployment f br the members to be appointed to the proposed Committee to advisetho Treasury on tho allocation of grants in aid oflocal Authorities for the relief of unemployment.The Conference agreed(1) That subject to the approval ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequeran announcement should be made intho House cf Commons that theChancellor of the Exchequer isprepared to give assistance toLocal authorities on well con-side rod schemes for dealing with unemployment and has decided toappoint a Committee to advise himthereon.-(2)    That the Chancellor of  the exchequer be recommended to invitethe following gentlemen to serve on the Committee:Lord St.  Davids, -or failing himLord Shaw., Chairman. -Mr, Frederics Palmer,ivlr. Pyhue-Sir Jh, Ferguson.Mr. Norman, 1*0 .0.Sir Thomas Monro.Mr.  J,Mb Bell, or mr..

Kenya Colony and Kenya Protectorate.It was -stated that a difference had arisen between theColonial office and the India Office regarding the treat-tee nt of Indians in this territory.    Since the war theColonial office had adopted a policy of segregation of indians, and heavy restrictions were imposed on them withregard to the ownership of promises and land.   Further,the Indians had been assigned an inferior political statusinasmuch as they had only two representatives on thelegislative council when the non-official -.1 Europe-mshid eleven.    It was oontended that since the war the(.position of Indians in the Frapire had deteriorated.In feet,   the treatment that they received now in terri-tcry recently owned by Germany was much worse than underthe Germwne.    The claims made by the Government of india on behalf of the Indian community in Kenya were (l) thatthe policy of race segregation should be abandoned.    Itwas a policy of disastrous interference in the vitaleconomic interests of the relatively large Indianc-ommunity on racial grounds and its adoption en these grounds was not only a new departure but was at variance with the traditional policy of the Imperial Government,and (2) that the Indian Community should be reassured asto its political security by declaration that the policycf the Imperial Government contemplated their ultimateattainment of     status cf political equality withEuropeans.On the other hand it was stated that a policy of absolute equality between Indians and white- settlers in east Africa was v-holly    Impracticable.   Purther,  thatin comparing the conditions of Asiatics and &quot;urcpeana
no reference had been made to the 5,000,000 native population which greatly out-numbered white and Indiansput together and who had no political status whatever.The attitude of the Colonial Office towards Indians hadnot suddenly become more oppressive - in fact the contrarywas the case.     Regarding the nember of Indian, representa-Ives on the Legislative Council, it was pointed outthat the numberof representatives was really of minor importance as the Legislative Council would do nothingagainst the wish of the Imperial Government, and theIndian representatives had as much chance as the whitesof making their views known.     With regard to the policyof segregation, Indians were free to go anywhere inthe whole country except in two respects,     There was   acertain Highland area which was alone suitable for whitesto live in, from which Indians were excluded but it wasnot known that- they had ever expressed any real wish to gothere j and in the towns there was an. Indian quarter and a white quarter.     This policy was not new since the warnInasfar as there had been any change recently it was ratherin favour of the   Indians,Tire Conference were reminded that the Indians ofIndia had put over 1,000,000 men Into the field duringthe war and had helped to conquer German ita^t Africa,We had -stated that we wished them to help the Empire,but the moment they desired, to take part in the trade ofthe Empire they were given notice that.they were notwanted,   ouch a position was difficult to maintain andwas an indefensible one before the whole&apos; of our EasternEmpire.     The position would   have to be reconsidered;.The Secretary of State for the Colonieswas requested bo consider the whole policy as regards the treatment of Indians Indifferent parts of the   Empire find toprepare a Memcranchun for the Cabinetgiving his views.

Consequentlyif the present Bill passed the House of Commons weshould be legislating for the Self-Goveining DominionsThe Secretary of State for the Coloniesproposed that a clause excluding the Dominions shouldbo inserted in the Bill.The Conference v/ere reminded that legislation of the character proposed might not at all bo suited to the conditions of India and that in any case before such legislation there should be consultation withthe Government of India.The Conference agreed that the BillShould be amended so as to exclude........... the...So If-Governing Dominions and0   ---     India /    its scope, and thoAttorney Geneiei urdcrtock tointroduce the am.endm.ent in the Houseof Commons.

It was also to Include the Lord Chancellorof Ireland, the Lord hay or of Dublin and. the Lord Mayorof Cord; as ex off icio Senators.It was stated that the Senate as proposed for theSouth would give seme protection to a Protestantminority, but such protection would be greatly strong-,thened if the 17 Senators to be nominated by the lord lieutenant were nominated by him on the advice of theBritish Ministers.     A-s the Bill stood, the lord lieutenant would nominate Senators or the advice ofhis Irish Ministers,After some discussion the Conference agreedTo accept the Lords&apos; Amendments regardingthe Senates for Northern and southern ireland, but that the Senate for NorthernIreland should be   elected by proportionalre pre sentaiion,(b) The Lords&apos; amendment with regard to theconstitution of the Council,of Ireland provided thathti-j c   mom.Dors,    theeach Parliament should
