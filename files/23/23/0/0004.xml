He reported captures,inthe house of the Chief of Staff of the Republican Army, of documents incriminating&apos; this official (who is now a fugitiveof connection with most serious crimes.    These it wan pro-posed to publish, after careful examination.The general tenor of the Chief secretary informs-tion was&apos; confirmed by other information, notably from theSouth and West of Ireland, where there are distinct signs that public opinion is turning against the railwayman whorefuse to carry military personnel and stores.Some indications were given to the- Cabinet of anabatement in the extreme&apos;demands of the Sinn Feiners.It was made clear that the Government had not departed from. their attitude of willingness to listen to any proposals from tho Sinn Fein leaders.MEMORIAL (o) With reference to Cabinet 59 (20), Conclusion 1,  .SERVICESCN NOVEMBER   the Cabinet placed on record their high appreciation of the -11th.organisation of the J/jemorial Services on November 11th, and took note of the remarkable success achieved. &apos; The PrimeMinister, on behalf of his colleagues, expressed the

Mr R.A.L. Fisher, who had taken his place at ameeting of the Council of the League of Nations on November14th, had now telegraphed that the French contingent was enits way to Vilna, and had urgently asked that the Britisharrangements might be expedited.    He therefore hoped thatthe natter might be pressed on with.The Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and War-stated that the matter was in hand, but that certain prelim-inary information had to be obtained.The Cabinet approved the provisionaldecision which had already been takenby the Prime Minister, that the troops should be sent; and the Secretary ofState for war undertook to expedite thearrangements for their despatch.TRADE RELATIONS    (6) With reference to Cabinet 53 (20), Conclusion 2,WITH RUSSIA.the Cabinet had before them the following documents relating
PageCabinet 61 (EO)Secretary&apos;s -Notes of a Meeting of theCabinet held November 17th 1920Sir Robert Home:    I wish to deal with thematter from the commercial aspect which is important.Prom the political point of view whatever we do weshall be as&apos;sailed.    The situation before thenegotiations with the Russian Delegation, say, atthe beginning of June, was that all export of goodswas prohibited.     The San Remo Conference said thatwe were to take off the embargo.    We did not.    It wasagreed by the Cabinet that to do so would be to takeoff the lever we had on Russia for getting other things we wanted, e.g., conditions in the Trade agreement:    (a) we should get the prisoners out of Russiabecause they were being badly treated, (b) we shouldinduce the Russians to give up hostile propaganda. ..Accordingly we have kept on the embargo on exportbut it has not been worth much.    It does not prohibitexport to Reyal.     On the Other hand the best Britishtraders will not export to Reval.    Our position would,be easier if we had decided only to take off the embargo.    If we do not now. complete the trade agree-ment no trade will take place.    On June 30th, afternegotiations with Krassin, we telegraphed memorandato Ghieherin incorporating conditions as to prisoners,propaganda, og$nggents to be free from molestation,and communieatyto be kept immune:    arrangements as to bringing gold Tnto this country.    If we do not carryout the terms of that agreement there will be anappearance of bad faith.    Provided they fulfil theconditions, we shall be guilty of bad faith if we dfcnot carry out the memorandum&apos;.    The Russians areprepared to put large orders in. this country and many, of the contracts are in an advanced state.    TheRussians are prepared to put down  10 million goldas security of trade to be done.     There will not bemuch reciprocal trade for some time because ,o&apos;fdefective rolling stock.    We shall have to start on abasis of gold.    It is, therefore, of the greatest importance to start trade from the commercial pointof view and because of the menace of unemployment,of the liklihood that during this winter the slumpwill last for a considerable time.     Traders say theyhave never known the textile trade so bad esjjeciallyin woollen goods, &quot;^he effects of the Mackinley ta/riffwere not nearly so bad.as now.     If we do not make the jjagreement (a):we&apos;shall lose trade to other countries; &apos;Jjin Germany Dr Simons talks of delivering millions of marks worth of trade to Russia.    She means tohave a big market there.    (b) Other countries are doing their best to get trade.    Reval is full of american agents and there have been shipments ofRussian gold to the U.S.A.Mr Chamberlain: The American banks have refusedto handle the Russian gold and in the mean time thatgold cannot find a market. !Sir Robert Home:    I feel strongly the only way we shall fight Bolshevism is by trade.    It thrivesbest in uncivilised conditions.     The longer Trotsky
keeps the terror up the longer he keeps up Bolshevism.-  Ourhankers are against the trading agreement unless on the basis that Russia agrees to pay all debts due by the Russian Govern-ment or nationals to Great Britain,-whatever the nature of the&apos;debt.    We had that point of view before-us in June.    Erassinmade it plaip that it was impossible to get them to recogniseall these debts.     It would have to be argued out in a peace treaty.   . We pressed him and he got immediate recognitionof cases in which goods had been supplied or services rendered tthis Russian Government or the previous one.    We accepted thatin the draft memorandum sent them.    We are morally bound bythat.    It has been published.     It does not mean that there isno possibility of getting the other debts paid:    that is leftto negotiations.    If we do not start trade we will never getthe debts paid.    The question arise-s of how payment is to bemade before the exchange of commodities.    Russia has rmmedabout  40 million of gold.Mr Churchill:&apos;        30 or  40 million.Sir Robert Horne:    The traders here won&apos;t start trading unless they are secure-&apos;  of payment., Traders would take risk ofarrest of gold provided the British Government does not come in.    The Attorney General dbes not think it can be arrested.Therefore we can say that we will not take or encourage actioh.There are bars of gold in neutral hands, e.g., at Copenhagen.Lord Colwyn has entered into a contract for the sale of rubbertyres and it is going on, the gold being deposited in Denmark.I think Mr Chamberlainfavoured dealing with gold in that waybut it restricts trade and is against our country.    Our tradinicommunity as a whole want to. resume trade though no doubtthere will be protests from concessionaires.Mr Balfour:    Is it agreed that we are bound in honour?Sir Robert Horne:    I think we are in good faith bound.Mr Bonar law:-   Consider the answers we have given in the Houseof Commons.Mr Churchill:    We have negotiated with a view to an agreement.The Prime Minister:    We are bound to enter into a trade agreement on the basis&apos; of July 1st - bound in honour if we canagree to details.Lord Curzon:    I do not dispute the propositions of the Boardof Trade.   My criticism is not devoted to the economic pointof view of the agreement but to the conditions of the agreement.They were subject to conditions which we have laid down repeat-Iedly as fundamental (a) complete repatriation of nationals,(b) cessation by Russia of hostile propaganda and the movementsagainst Great Britain in the East..    These conditions we havetwice since repeated.   Let us make sure that they fulfil their side.      (Lord curzon then summarised his memorandum C?P. 2099)The Russian menace in the East v.is incomparably greater than anything else that has happened in my time to the BritishEmpire.Lord Curzon then referred to the Prime Minister&apos;s Answer inthe House of Commons of November 8th and he proceeded toexamine the degree to which the assurances given by the russians had been carried out.     First as to prisoners.     We knew fromthe the advice that Chicherin had been giving to Krassin thatthe Russians had been trying to trick us.The Prime Minister interposed that the telegram simply meant that Chicherin wanted to be sure of getting Babushkin.
I W.C.&apos; Poem 2.File No.Page97Lord Curzon, continuing:    Babushkin has got across the frontier.We have over 100 British not yet returned.     We have that onthe authority of Major Wining, a Siberian prisoner who has reached Helsingfbrs.    He says there is a considerable numberof prisoners in Moscow.      And the authority of Mrs Frome whohas been in Petrograd looking after our nationals there whosays that were are 75 prisoners in Petrograd.     We cannotassume that the Soviet Government know of all these.     There maybe some who are dead; there may be some who do not want to comeback but it is certain that there are prisoners there now,names of theThe Prime Minister:    Were the/76 on Mrs Prome&apos;s list aad-w-e^etfeeee-H&amp;sies supplied to Mameneff?Lord Curzon:     Yes, we gave the list to Kameneff.The Prime Minister:    I understood yesterday that these 76 were a new find.&apos;Lord Curzon.said that he had wired about them,     &quot;As topropaganda why am I concerned about this?     Because e  thewhole of the evidence that from Moscow to Tashrent conspiraciesworked by Bolshevik agents and paid for by Bolshevik goldare going on.     let us assume the agreement concluded.     What is going to happen?     They do not intend to desist from propaganda.The purport and pith of their Government is propaganda through-out the&quot; world.    You conclude an agreement with them.     The samebusiness will go on at Teheran, Baku, Enzeli, Bokhara, etc.You will be in the midst of negotiations here which you cannotbreak off.    You will find that after the trading agreement all this will go on just the same.    What they want is a politicaldiscussion with ourselves.    Are we going to invite a Bolshevikdelegation here to go through all these details about the East?Bolshevik Government.    There isThe Prime Minister did onceAre we prepared to meet a politicalall round?   In my opinion weshould be very cautious at signing the trade agreement becausethe two conditions have not been loyally acted upon.That means recognition of thesomething to be said for that,suggest that sort of thing,delegation here to make peaceMr Chamberlain said he agreed generally with Lord Curzon andraised the issue: were the conditions to take effect after,the signing of the agreement.The Prime Minister said there were two or three things that U-Z.ought not to hage done.Mr Chamberlain:     The only case where we acted in the contrarysense.was when the Prussians broke faith about Poland.The Prime Minister:     We acted as though the agreement were notin operation or as if it were suspended.     We unloaded riflesat lahtkigwith our own troops.   We organised a military mission to Poland and invited the Prench to co-operate.    If this agree-ment were in operation we had no business to do these things.These were either a suspension of the agreement or a breach ofthe agreement or an assumption that the agreement was not inforce.   The Russians saysyou must&quot;take one interpretation orthe other and not interpret it either way as it suits you.    Theonly way; in which we can justify ourselves is that the agreement was not in force and their case is that there has been no agreement.Wt.46,439-51. 7500.&apos;12/16. Gtp.133.

Lord Curzon referred to a telegram of the previous day whichimplied that the Soviet Government held us as bound by theagreement in connection with Wrangel and that we had violatedour assurances.      (It was-pointed out that Wrangel had been dealt with separately from the main agreement.)The Lord Chancellor:     This a point of law and interpretationand the Prime Minister is right.Sir Eric Geddes:      It was put clearly to us when we senttroops to Dantzig.Lord Curzon:    I want the two conditions made effective before we sign the agreement.Mr Bonar La?/:     I agree with Horne:   we have been playing with!this Russian situation too long.   You cannot go on talking and]not&apos; conclude an agreement.    We are in for bad unemployment.There is some business to betgot in this way.    If we make no agreement the effect on the public mind of the imaginaryvolume of trade which would never take place, but which theythink would take place if there were an agreement, would bevery bad.    As to propaganda - it is a small part of the dangerf.They are forming an alliance with kemal - if that goes on theagreement will be broken.    If we make no agreement we shallhave no leverage against the political hostility of Russia.We would then be inviting them to carry on hostilities.We shall have power to stop the agreement.    Our traders wouldnot send goods except against payment in London.    If they goon with Kemal we will stop the agreement.    We shall have  armore chance of exercising pressure on Russia after an agreemBift.I agree with Home that Bolshevism will come to an end undercivilised conditions.    There are conflicting elements within,the Soviet Government and a party that loathes &apos;ae trade agreement.    It is our business to consider what is our inter-est.    What is the use of our saying that we won&apos;t do tradebecause we cannot get the old debts paid?     Trade will be done]as long as they have gold.    1 do not like the form of thedraft agreement that some debts will be recognised now and sonJ(not.    It is a pity it was put that way.    It would have been better to have a provisional arrangement.    Llewelyn Smith putsthe view clearly.    Our view ought to be to reserve the ultimatedebts for a treaty.    We have been shilly-shallying for twoyears.     We shall lose the chance of political influence and do it at the expense of losing some trade.The Prime Minister:     I am in entire agreement with Horneand Bonar Law.    This iH a policy ?/e adopted a year ago.    Itwas agreed to by Prance and Italy.    I have deferred a good desfto the feelings o^ some of my colleagues and I must now make up my mind.    It is a decision of the first magnitude-.    If we take a wrong turning it will be^responsibility which we shallregret.   If we allow our judgment to be deflected by naturalrepugnance the people of this country will visit it on us.There has been too mucla considering all this as conferring aboon on Bolshevik Russia.    Our hatred leads us to say wewould rather hurt ourselves than do them good.     But we haveprimarily got to consider our interests for we are in for abad time.    I have seen a good many business man and they haverather frightened me about the next 18 months.    Bonar Law andmet Rylands, the Chairman of the Federation of BritishIndustries, and he was not in a position to challenge the view]taken by business men.      There are no orders coming in.Customers won&apos;t buy.     We may have the worst period ofunemployment any of us have known.     The Russians are prepared!to p.ay -down-in gold and you won&apos;t -buy.    We trade with cannibaTin the Solomon Islands.    Within the last few days an offerhas-been made to the British Government for  10 million worthon condition that the drder.shall be put in this country hutI must not give details.    I am appalled by the accuracy of
W.C.&apos;Form 2.Page&quot;b It i&apos;sthe information in the newspapers to-day about -eur meeting.In the case of this offer payment will he made by british firms.    If we refuse it it will leak out that we turned it down because of Persia and Tashrent and because we hate theBolsheviks at a time when we are voting  4 or  5 millions for the-unemployed.     Of the  10 million, half of it would bewages.    This will be said over and over again and will add tothe public discontent.       When at Lucerne I. got a documentfrom Dr Simons.     He said he had an offer of 600 million gold marks worth of orders from Russia which he coulddistribute through Germany.    He was anxious we should finance the operation and he asked if he could come to British marketsI saw the Chancellor&apos;of the Exchequer and we agreed we couldnot help to find work in Germany.    That will become known.Mr Chamberlain;It has broken down.The Prime Minister:     Because they were unable to finance it.The gold is passing to Sweden and there they are giving orders.Germany, Sweden and the U.S.A. will be getting orders and weshall be denounced for refusing to sanction the trade agreementDr Macnamara:Donation.We are Spending  5 millions on the Out-of-work  the Prime Minister:    That makes  10 million in all.    As topropaganda, Curzon says we must have an undertaking thatpropaganda has ceased.    Even with the best will in the worldwith Bolshevik outbreaks you will not be able to restrain it.As long as there is a pamphlet published in India our officials who are violently anti-Bolshevik, will hold that the conditions have not been fulfilled.      Our officials would have helpedWrangel if they had had. their way.    It is no use saying that ifsix months hence there is no propaganda you will enter into anagreement.     By that time you will be In the depths of trade depression and you will be forced to make a trade agreement.Our manufacturers are in favour.    The financiers naturallywant their Bonds.     I don&apos;t blame them.     But the pressure fromthe Midlands is all the other way.    ISr epilte of a lot of news-paper propaganda here there has been no response to the campaign to prevent trade with Russia.    It was tried in theHouse of Commons but with no success.     When I mentioned thepossibility of our going to war to support Poland a shudderpassed through the House and those who were clamouring against bolshevism immediately shewed the-white feather.    I hope youwill allow Home to negotiate on the basis of the draft agree-ment of July 1st.    If we try to enlarge it we are departing from it.    It was circulated at the time.    If we make conditionsprecedent it will mean that we are not prepared to trade while there is a Soviet Government.    I have heard predic/tions aboutthe fall of the Soviet Government for the last two years.Denikin, Judenitch, Wrangel, all have collapsed but I cannot see any immediate prospect of the collapse of the SovietGovernment.The discussion wasthe following day.adjourned until(tyS&apos; Wt45&apos;!!?-li: moo. 12/16.
