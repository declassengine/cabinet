0Galrir^et r^43e^ore them the. f oIJuTwlngj doeinneists :-Third Interim Report of the CabinetOormmittee (Paper G.P.-2202) .A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour(Paper G.Pj,-2233j,A Memorandum by the Minister&apos;of Health(Paper 0.P.-SC77J.The Cabinet were reminded that they had already taken.decisions in regard to various aspects of Unemployment   e.g.Arterial Roads,, Housing4 Emigration, Part Time, etc.    Todaythey were askui to consider proposals in regard to districts in which unemployment was not adequately covered by these schemes.    For these, the following alternative scher.es hadbeen made by the Cabinet CHi.im.ittee:-       EE(i) To encourage local Authorities-to undertakeworks of public-utility in. their districts,and to assist with Parliamentary grants inthe case of approved schemes to the extentcf the. extra cost due to the use of unem-ployed labour:-  (ii) To rely an the machinery provided by.theUnemployed Workmen Act, 19Q5, viz., theestablis-hmeht in the affected areas cfcentral unemployed bodies and local Els-tress Committees; - with the function of preparing registers of unemployed and setting up relief&apos;works - the cost over. ,:&quot;  the value of the work done being met byI a Parliamentary grant, -with such voluntary-contributions as may be obtainable.It was explained that the above prpp.ps.als were not entirely alternative, insomuch as in some districts therewould be no works of public utility to be.undertaken, andthe question arose as to whether in such areas the second-alternative -should not be adopted. ..In considering these proposals the Cabinet were reminded that in no previous year had more than  308,000been devoted by the State to unemploy ent.    The present-proposals would amount almost to a blank cheque- to LocalAuthorities.    The State would in practice have to advance alar-pe wart of the-&apos;&apos;capital expenditure involved.    To raise thenecessary funds from the money market was net feasible,  8ft&amp;.the condition of our national finances did not justify it.
.oFrom a financial point of view, therefore,- the Chancellor of the? Exchequer urged two points of principle:-(i) That$ the Cabin-.t should incur no indefiniteliability, and spr-m definite limit for theexpenditure of the Central Unemployed Sodyshe - Id he fixed: J(ii) That work started as relief eork should bepaid for as relief work   and,  since thelabour employed thereon&apos;would be definitelyof lower-efficiency, at rates of pay belowTrade Union rates,Ther-&apos; was general agreement with the first principle, but with regard to the second it was-strongly pressed that itwas impossible to induce&apos; Local Authorities to undertake work at rates pf pay below Trade Union rates.    The attempthad broken down dn the ease of the arterial reads, in regardto whichthe Cabinet had decided that for the first four months,, while learning their work, men ;should only receive75 per cent, of Trade Union rates (Cabinet 54 (20), Conclu-sion 4).    This decision the Cabinet had subsequently rescind-ed (Cabinet 59 (20), Appendix VIII (l) )..&apos;   The only feasibleplan was to pay full rates for a limited number qf daysThere eas somc discussion in regard to the central body to administer Unemployed Funds,  and a number of sug-gestioris mere made.    It was generally agreed that theauthorities . constitut ed under the Act of 19C5 were&apos; not suitable, and that no- Cabinet Minister should be a memberof any Central Body set up to allocate grants-in-aid of localrelief works.The conclusions of the Cabinet may be summarised asfollows:-(a) To accept the first but not the secondproposal&apos; contained in the Third Reportof the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment,viz,, -to encourage Local Authorities toundertake works of public utility intheir districts:(b) A sum of  3,, GOG,000 should be allocated to this purpose:(c) A Central Committee should be established-or the administration of the fund and theco-ordination and approval of schemes cfLocal Authorities:
(d) Sir Laming vsorthington Evan:!, in consulta-tion with the Cabinet Committee on Unenploy-ment,- should advise the Cabinet .as to the composition of the Central Body:(e) To accept the principle of Trade Unionrates,  combined with - short - time.v/SSlBLE-SCHEME    (2) In the course of the precedinp; discussion,  reference of LONG CREDIT.was made to alternative means of finding employment, whichhad suggested - themselves as the.result of conversations between certain members of the Government .and prominentbankers.    The broad outline of these schemes war, that theGovernment should risk a certain sun, for the insurance ofbanksv which right then finance some of the industries now on short time, such as the-textile industry., thereby enabling them to give long credit to customers in countries which wishto - buy but,  o^inpr to exchange and other financial difficulties-ties, are not in a position to pay, and thus give mere em-ploy me nt oThe Cabinet were informed that the bankers in question had undertaken to submit a schemm which, so far as members were in a position to judge from the general indicationsgiven, met with general commendation^The President of the Board of Tradeundertook to hasten the- preparationof this scheme.fiitionalstories.(5) with reference to Cabinet 67 (20)., Conclusion 4 (a),the Cabin-;, t further considered the Second Interim Report ofthe Cabinet CoTlttee on Unemployment (Taper G.P.-2145), andthe following documents a Memorandum by Sir L. Earthing ton Evans(Paper CpIm-2C95) ,A Memo ran da-   by the Minister o^ Transport(Paper C.P.-2196).-The Cabinet reaffirmed th- ir Conclusionthat, with a vie1&apos;.&apos; to the absorption of-unemployed labour,in their areas, theindustrial establishments of the Govern-ment controlled by the Admiralty and thegar 0&apos;&quot;fice should be placed on short time.They adjourned the consideration of thefuture of Woolwich and simil-r factoriesuntil the policy of short-time had beenput into opem:to.on,
oUlSKPLOYMENT.       (4) The Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Uner-plcrymentnegotiations   reported that Rene progress had. boon na.de in ascertainingwith TradeUnionsthe viees of Local Authorities with regard to &quot;ring-fence&quot;schemes, and that he would report mere fully On--the matter in th^ course&apos; or a few days. ..
ft(5) With reference, to Cabinet 67 (2c), Conclusion 1, theCabinet had before them the following documents on thesubject of our policy in Mesopotamia as affected by militaryand. financial considerations:-A Memorandum by the Secretary oe Statefor War (Paper C.P.-2275J,.A Telegram from the High Commissioner,Baghdad, dated December 8, 1020(Paper C.P.-2B89).Tko Cabinet were informed that the High Coumissioneresestimate of the troops which would be required after March 511921, in order to hold the area at present occupied, was 2Divisions and a Cavalry Brigade, with troops on the line rhfo ommuni cat ions, but exclusive of troops in North West Persia.The General Staffs estimate, which tool; into account thelatest information as to the menace of external aggression,was for a ferae of 3 Divisions and 6 Cavalry Regiments,exclusive or troops in Persia.    Before the Cabinet Meeting,the 7/ar Office had made a hasty cor nutation of the cvst ofthe farmer, which amounted,very approximately, to  25,000,000a year.    The estimate for the garrison as calculated by theGeneral Staff was in the region of  30,000,000.    The suggest-iwn was made that, as either sum. was greatly in excess ofwhat we could afford to pay, the alternative proposal indi-cated in the General Staffs Memorandum, should be adapted,viz., to withdraw fro: north Persia,. Mosul and Baghdad, to aline covering Basra and. the Anglo-Persian oilfieldsfor thedefence of 1hieh about one Division would suffice, at a costnot exceeding  8,000,000 per annum.   In this connection the^*n*?ral St*** -.vere quoted as bring o* opinion that mesopotamia and horth Persia w^re of no importar.ce from the point of viewof the defence of India, and that from that point of view the expenditure of a fraction of t e cost would yield betterresults     if spent on strategical railways and improvingconditions in India..
.0 The Cabinet were informed that a very large consensus. of military ana Governmental opinion on the spot held that th.retirement to the lin- proposed by the General Staff would   alany Kite in the event of attach, require as large a force asis required to hold the present area of occupation.The Cabinet were also informed that if this policy were adopted the British Mandate would be destroyed, thelocal Arab Government would disappear and its local levieswould never be raised;    and the Turks, possibly in collusionwith the Bolsheviks^ would enter into the vacuum thus created.The Cabinet were reminded that in any event the with-drawal could not be commenced until the Spring, as the forces must be maintained, even as far up-country as Mosul, to cover the withdrawal of tho forces in North Persia,    Hence, animmediate decision was not very urgent.On the other hand^ it was essential to the Secretaryof State for War to knew the general policy of the Governmenton the question^ not with a view to announcing that policy,but to guide him in the general line he should take up in theforthcoming Debate on the Army Supplementary Estimate onDecember 15th.The Cabinet adjourned the question, witha view to its continuance the same after-noon at&apos; 5-30, when the Secretary was instructed to summon Sir Arnold vVilsonand General-Radcliffe to attend.9     $ .   *     *     *      *2, Whitehall hardens, S.&apos;w. 1,
