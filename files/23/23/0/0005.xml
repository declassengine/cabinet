DISCLOSURES IN ? PERSONAL MEMOIRS.

(1) The attention of the Cabinet was invited to a Parliamentary Question addressed to the Prime Minister by Major-General Sir Newton Moore, drawing attention to disclosures of vital and confidential Government business in recently published memoirs, and asking whether the Government proposed to take any steps.

Attention was called in particular to the publication in such memoirs of official telegrams and Cabinet documents without any permission being obtained. In some cases unpublished confidential documents existed which actually contradicted statements that had been published.

It was stated that the practice sanctioned by custom was that personal documents should not be used without the authority of the writer,  and no State document should be published without the permission of the official custodian.

The Cabinet were reminded that the Cabinet itself was a Committee of the Privy Council, and that the permission of the King was required for the publication of its proceedings.

The Cabinet left it to the discretion of the Prime Minister to reply on the lines of the discussion summarised above.

LEAKAGE OF CABINET SECRETS.

(2) With reference to Cabinet 55 (20), Conclusion 6, arising out of the previous discussion attention was called to a scandalous instance of leakage, in editions of the Press issued comparatively early in the afternoon of the previous day, of information regarding the discussion of the cabinet held on the ?  on the subject of Russia, some indication having been given (even of the views expressed by individual ? at the ?.

It was pointed out that the Minutes of the Meeting on this subject ? under the instructions or the, Prime Minister deliberately ? drafted so as to reveal no details of the views taken by members of the Cabinet, and that they had not been circulated until after the partial disclosures had appeared in the afternoon papers.
There was general agreement that the utmost reticencemust in future be observed about what had passed at Cabinetq M--.etJ.ng3.BE WORTH (3) With reference&apos; to Cabinet 59 (20), Conclusion 4    the?R3La RIFI^S;.atMn4^ 6n o* the Cabinet, was drawn to a Qu-sticn in Parlia-merit asking for information a3 to whether a subsidy had been paid fro.   &quot;ritiah snurcea for the Cossack Division in Persia,and the draft Reply which stated that half the subsidy was paid fron- March, 1918, to May, 1920, from Imperial funds.It was explained that the reply given in the draftAnswer was correct and referred to past expenditure, whichhad been shared by the Indian Government. The most recentdevelopment had followed the ignominious failure of theCossack Division before the Bolsheviks, as the result ofwhich it had been found necessary %o dismiss Colonel Star-ossel3ki and the other Russian officers, of the Division whohad nro^&quot;d cowardly and Incompetent.    The policy of  withdraw--ing the British force from Persia next Spring rendered neceo-s-ary the establishment of soc-e efficient Persian force forthe maintenance of order.   It had consequently been decidedto utilise, for the re-organisation of the Cos such Division,the British officers who had been sent to Teheran to re-organise the Persian Array, but whoso activities had been postponed owing to the delay of the Mejliss in ratifying theAnglo-Persian Agreement.    This would involve us in a future expenditure, but it was hoped to r-cover this from thePersian Government if and when the Agreement was ratified.This was considered to be the cheapest way of extricatingthA **r!Msh *orc*8 T&quot;ror&apos;- North Persia.   It was furtherindicated that there   as some prospect of providing the comof th? North Persian force by a reduction in the SouthPersia Rifles.The Oabinot agr-&apos;-:dThat, in reply to Mr James Brown&apos;s Question,it was sufficient to state the cost &quot;of the-2-   &apos;
British subsidy paid to the South PersiaKitleg sine-, the conclusion of th&quot; - aradding that the Indian Government had &quot;made a similar contribution,(4) -*!t* re^ronoo to Cabinet 61 (20), Conclusion 6,th&quot; Cabin-t resumed thir discussion on the question of there opening or Trading - Relations with Hussia.After a full discussion on ev*ry aspect of the ques-tion, the Cabinet agreed^ by a considerable majority(a) That the President.of the Board of trade should be authorised to conclude a TradingAgreement with Russia on the general linesof the exchange of Notes of June and July,1920, cormonly referred to as &quot;the July Agr- e-m,ent&quot;, subject to the amendments of principleindicated in these Conclusions (P.0;* Paper207569):(b) That the Agree.1.:ent should be drawn up onthe understanding that tee conditions ac-cepted as a basis of the Agreement, and set forth in the British Mote of June 30,1920, should not have to be fulfilledprior to the conclusion o&quot;&apos; the- TradingAgreement* except that the Agreement shouldnot actually be signed until the Governmentare satisfied that the release of the wholeof the. British prisoners is assured:(c) That the said conditions should be defi-initely re-stated in the Trading Agreement,and that a stipulation should be includedin the Trading Agreement to the effect that,in the event of either party failing to fulfil it, the other party would be entitledto denounce it:(d) That the attention Of the Russian government or its representative should be drawn, either in the Agreement itself or in a covering com-wunication to the Russian representatives,to any sp oially important respects in which,in accordance -ith the terms of the Agreement,the Bolsheviks Exist alter their present pro-cedure or policy, e,g., to annul their treaty with Afghanistan,  to desist from co-operationwith Mustapha gemal^ and frog hostilities orpropaaanda in Persia, India, etc.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,&quot;-  in communication with the Secretary of Statefor India-and the Secretary of  Sta-te  &quot;or  .ar,and oth r Departments as necessary, to coim-iu-communicate with the President of the Board of Thadeon these points&quot;.(e) That the alternative draft of Article 84attached to th - dra&apos;t Trading Agreementset forth in the document circulated by thePresi^rf of the Boa:d of Trade (Payer c.P.-2 086), should be adopted in preference to the-original dra.-rt:
(.t) That Article 9 o   the Draft Agreement should-he r^-examined by the Board of Trade   inconsultation with the Treasury, and,&quot;-ifnecessary,.re-drafted so as toVroiect th,einterests of the British Government, onthe one hand, while, on the other,  doing nothing to disturb the legal position ofRussian gold,, securities and commodities:(g) That the Trading Agreement should be sodrawn as not to vary our present goldpolicy or interfere with the regulationsrestricting the export of gold:&quot;(h) That the President of the Board of trade should circulate the Agreement to theCabinet in its final draft form:(1) That the Prime Minister, in ansvWr to aQuestion in the house of Commons , to beput that afternoon, should announce thatthe Cabinet have decided that a draft agreement to carry out the July arrange-ment for trade with Russia should beprepared, which it was hoped would heready for presentation to  the RussianGovernment in a few daysIt was generally understood that theconclusion of a Trading Agreement onthese lines would not be assumed to hamper the discretion of ministers in public statements regarding the bolshevist system of Government.1iTREATY OF (5) With reference to Cabinet 60 (20) , Conclusion 6, the&apos;JVRRSAILIHS(Article 21?). Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary covering aJRight to In-   letter from the Army Council on the subject of th- right toSvestigationsI in Germany.     investigation of armaments in Germany under Article 213 ofthe Treaty of Versailles (Paper CP.-2094).This Note recalled that on Novmber 10th. the cabinet had approved proposals grut forward by the British (Naval,Millta-y and Air) &quot;Oel^eetion that th&apos; Commission of Laves ti-gation. for ensuring that Germany does not attempt to evadeher obligations as regards disarmament, after the disbandmenrof the Inter-Allied Commissions of Control, should include(i). A President from among the members of thePermanent Advisory Commission of the Leagueof Nations:- (it) The local Attaches and such other membersof the Permanent Advisory Commission asthe Council may direct:(iii) Additional technical members.&apos;.to be askedfor when required by the Council for suchGovernments as they decide.
The letter from the Army Council,attached to the Note,urged that local Attaches should not. be members of the Commis-location of Inv stigation, on the ground that Military Attachesshould be in close touch and on good torn s with the dar Officeand other military authorities of the country to which theywere accredited, a position which was hardly consistent withthat o-* n n^wb-r 0-&quot; a Commission for extorting information from an unwilling Govern&apos;.- ent.The Cabinet were informed that the Admiralty were inagreement with the dar Office view, hut that the Air ministry had not the same objections, sin?&quot; the British Air Attache&quot;in Berlin would, not find any Military Ai    Service with whichit would be necessary for him to keep on good terms.In the course of the discussion on this question, at-tention was called to the increasing cost of the League ofNations and the lack of control on its expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated that he wouldprobably take action to raise the whole ,of this question.A opr &quot;h ens ions wero expressed that a- decision to dis-pense with the use of Attaches for this purpose might resultin the addition, by the League of Nations, of permanent estab-lishments to re. lace the;; .The Cabinet agreed  (a) To revise their former decision:(b) That the British members of the PermanentAdvisory Commission should be informed thatthey should not agree to the employment oflocal Attaches at Berlin foe the purposeproposed:(c) That the Secretary of the Cabinet should,communicate &quot;this decision to h.r Wisher:(d) That ,r Pish r and the : ritish members ofthe Permanent Advisory Go: -mission of theLeague of Nations should be notified at the8r*i time that, in any alternative arrange-ment th-1 - as enter d into, the utmost regard should be had to &quot;conomy, and that additionalpermanent charges on th* funds of the Leagueof Nitions should,, as far ar/possible, be avoided.,:.-BOUR COteMlS-     (6) The Cabinet agreed -SIGN OP ENQUIRY s    ^    . .IB IRBLANB.

\Y:C. P6rm 2.File No.(lit ^ItiSCabinet 62 (20)November 18th 1920.The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the russian trade Agreement.Mr Churchill said the Cabinet were not committed.Six weeks ago the question had been one of firing out Kameneff andKrassin because of their bad faith.     He then read portions ofMr Wise&apos;s paper of Jan.; 7th 1920 when there was a hope of getting food and commodities for the world.   &quot; At that -timethe Prime Minister would have preferred goods to gold becauseof the educative value of the process on the peasants, butthis had not been allowed.    They have only gold and diamonds.The Co-operatives have been absorbed by the Bolsheviks. Thereis no corn in view.     Part of the gold belongs to the RoumanianState Treasury.    The U.S.A. won&apos;t handle the gold. Many people in this country believe it is their&apos;s.     The scale of theproposed- transactions is petty compared with the bulk of british trade.   - The  10 millions is not big enough to alter appreciablythe economic situation in Russia and will only bolster up theBolshevik Government and their military organisation.    they want cloth and boots to equip their army.    Next, the  5 million is less than a -g-d in the   of our national wages bill.    Next,ought we to give special formal countenance to the BolshevikGovernment in advance of Prance and U.S9A?     A Coalition Govern-ment ought not to give countenance to communism.    I object tohelping them out of the difficulties which they have made for themselves by their communism.     It would be far better to saythat there shall be no blockade and that anyone might trade athis own risk except in military material.    As to the agreementwe should not turn it down but we ought to make sure that theyhave given evidence of good will and ceased hostilities in theEast.    The alliance with Xemal/ought to be dissolved in advance.We ought to get the rest of the prisoners away.    If we removedthe embargo on trading we could then answer any questions of apolitical character. &apos;&apos;Minister said&quot;the difference between my view andig iS on the question whether you make it a conditionthe agreement that all abuses should stop.     I sayagreement and conditions Qf^trade - you break themops.&apos;    I do not challenge/the proportion of trade the public will exaggerate what you will get ifThe PrimeMr Churchillprecedent offHere is theand trade stis small but you stop it.- -JThe Prime Minister then referred to an interview with RobertWilliamsAon the relation of unemployment to Russian trade.Lord Curzon:     Our prohibition of exports is valuelessbecause it is inoperative.Sir Robert Horne:    Our decent traders won&apos;t go behind the back of the Government, nor will the Russians trade except withan agreement.     The Prench were not actually trading but tradeis free with the U.S.A. There is some evidence of Russian&apos;goldhaving been shipped to Prance.Mr Chamberlain:     Let me know the evidence for that.Mr Churchill read lac report to the effect that the PrenchGovernment had no transactions with the Russians.
Mr Balfour:     How far is it true that you are nowproposing&apos; to do for Russia what you would not do to others?The Prime Minister:     We have consuls in the U.S.A.protecting our&apos; trade.     We would not want this &quot; agreement ifwe were at peace with Russia.     It is a substitute for that.Mr Balfour; then referred to the propaganda in the East.&quot;If you are going to wait for all abuses to be removed it ishopeless but suppose we said we will make the agreement on condition that the Russians shew good faith by doing some ofthe big things, namely, Kemal, Afghanistan Treaty, and the attack on Persia?The Prime Minister:     There are Bolsheviks in Persiafor whom the Soviets are not responsible.      (He then read a portion of the agreement where the Russians undertook to refrom hostile action.)       This agreement of July is the basis for the trade agreement.     We have agreed in principle tothis and have put off month after month and done nothing.    i suggest that we go into the agreement by which,weeare bothbound. -Mr Montagu:     There exists an agreement signed byMustapha Kemal and the Bolsheviks, and one signed with the amir of Afghanistan against India.      Vifould they not have to repudiate this before concluding an agreement?The Prime Minister:    We can say that from henceforththere will be no hostile action.     You can name all the places.     If you delay the winter will pass without an agreeement.     The Bolsheviks deny the agreement with Kemal. Theymay tell us it is a lie.      Our Foreign Office takes reports from our agents and says the Bolsehviks are Interfering.Meanwhile trade is going from bad to worse.    I do not believe in this story about Mustapha Kemala -   The Bolsheviks do not know the extent to which the Turks are playing a double game.The Russians disapprove of the advance of Zeligowski on VilnacjLord Curzon:     Take Persia.    It is a question of a bolshevik force of 3,000 to 5,000 in occupation of the portsfighting the Cossack brigade.    There is no doubt about it.The Prime Minister:    I think it is a rising of Bolshevistwithin the countries.    If you say you will not trade untilyou get all this put right you will get endless arguments.I would enter into the trade agreement, take the risk and sayif you break this the trade is gone and the burden rests with you.Lord Curzon:    Take Afghanistan.    I come down with myevidence that they are breaking the agreement.The Prime Minister:    You would say when concluding theagreement &quot;unless we are satisfied that propaganda is dis-continued trade will stop.  .  We shall judge the facts.ramLord Curzon:England..They will ask then for a mission toThe Prime Minister:    Take Afghanistan.    You ccme hereafter ratification of the agreement.    The, Poreign Office is.natisfied that the Russians are breaking the agreement.    give them time to communicate with their agi^ents, then, if propag-anda does not cease within a specified time, the tradeagr e em ent s t troops .Lord Curzon:    I shall be here in six weeks,give a trading agreement, long to live.I do hot
W&apos;&apos;.C. &apos;Form 2.PageMr Bonar Law:    We can specifically mention cases where thereis hostile action.Mr Montagu:    There is a Treaty under which Moscow, pays a subsidy to the Amir and pays agents to stir up action on theAfghan borders.The Prime Minister:    You can refer to hostile action in specific cases.    I am not here as an advocate of Bolshevism.I am trying to present Bolshevism in this country.Mr Balfour:    The Bolsheviks may break their word.    Sow theyhave every motive for doing so*Mr Chamberlain:    My position is very close to Curzon!sand Churchill?s.    I would much prefer to say we sweep downall barriers and let them trade at their own risk.    It wouldbe a condition of allowing people to trade that the prisonersshould be released.    I would prefer not to make an agreementbut we cannot take that line after the intervention of theLord Chancellor yesterday.    We must therefore have an agreement.Then certain features become important.The Prime Minister:   May we take it that the principle of concluding a trading agreement is accepted?Lord Birkenhead:    Yes-with great difficulty^    I agree.Lord CurzPn:    I want conditions precedent.Mr Montagu:    I agree with Curzon.Mr Churchill:     I should like a discussion on the conditions^,I have not accepted the P.M.!s ruling.Lord Curzon:Maf-^feamteerlain.     Long agrees with me.    I have a letter from him.   -Mr Chamberlain:    I feel bound ex officio to call attentionto my clientele,the financiers&apos;, the accepting houses.    The greatfinancial houses are wholly opposed-to this agreement.      Thereis a letter from them to the P.M.  (CP,1917)       They object toan agreement which picks out particular debts for recognition,and by implication suggests they are in a different categoryfrom other debts.Mr Bonar Law referred to the amended draft of Sir HubertLlewelyn Smith (CP,2086).      We advanced a large sum to theRussian Banks.     It has been seized by the Soviets.    You getacknowledgement from the Russian Government which makes ourposition worse than if we made no agreement.    The original paper(i,e., end of June) refers to debts and the Cabinet was responsible for it. &apos; -Mr Chamberlain:    I saw Mr Wise sometime ago and discussed this agreement.     The interview arose out of a complaint that hewas not keeping the Treasury informed and protecting our interestI raised the question of the meaning, of &quot;services rendered&quot;.  ,Sir Hubert Llewelyn Smith has drawn an alternative clause whichI prefer to the original and I hope it will be taken.    As togold and jewels the Attorney General has taken one view butleading counsel have given the banks a contrary view.I am told that claims will be asserted in the Courts to seizegold or minerals or other property of the Rnssian Government(17,368). WUG.489-51. 7500. 12/10. Gp.133. A.&amp;E.W.
on the ground that it belongs to the claimants.    If thathappens we and the Bank of England are interested.      TheBank of England ought to join pro:   forma as interested parties in the cold storage Bills which the Governmentguaranteed.Mr Chamberlain then referred to the words &quot;take and encouraging^in the draft agreement and said that at the Committee ithad been agreed to omit these&apos;words and substitute &quot;initiateaction&apos;.    &quot;The reason why gold is not coming here is fear ofseizure.     We should give no guarantee against seizure butwe do not allow, gold to be exported.     They want to re-exporat the world price.     If it comes here they get the Mintprice of 85/- as against the world price of 120/-.    I circulated to the Cabinet in June a paper by Mr Blackettstating that gold finds it difficult to get a?;ay exceptthrough London.    Recentlyb 300,000 pounds of! Swedish goldhas been sold to the Bank at the Mint price.&apos;&quot;   The swedish government had tried to sell it to the jewellers.    Eor thepurpose of our currency policy and to avoid a declaration that our notes are incontrovertible - which they are -it is essential to maintain prohibition of export of gold.The bars which have come here from Sweden are identifiableas English gold.  Mo douijt the Swedes are getting the equivalent in Russian Go;d of what they have shipped to us.What are the Russians selling the gold to Sweden for?   Eitheis outright and the Swedes are stuck with a loss or the swedes will credit them with the equivalent realised andthus the Russians will bear the loss.     The Board of trade should realise that the draft agreement does not oblige usto vary any regulation of that kind or to alter our goldpolicy or licenses of exports.Sir Robert Horne:    The agreement does not vary our policy,krassin was asking for the world price but the Bartersyndicate refused.    Traders are willing to goron in spiteof the gold policy.Mr Chamberlain: Can&apos; you take Sir Hubert Llewelyn Smith&apos;sclaueS?Sir Robert Horne: Yes, it is my clause. So far as theRussians go it does not matter but the comfort of our owntraders is the point. It leaves the British Governmentfree to ride in on the back of others who will take action.The traders are not going to take the risk if the BritishGovernment is going to be a party to aa action. It is aquestion of the psychology of the traders.Mr Chamberlain:    Should we be precluded from coming herein after  action has been taken by others and had been sueeess-ful? .Sir Robert Horne:    We can discuss this fg&amp;m-with theTreasury and get a form of words.Mr,Churchill:   . There is no question of overriding claimsor geving special protection to this gold?f&quot;e&apos;&quot;&apos; m.v.&apos;-&apos;.-.-      . aLord Birkenhead&apos;:    Ho question - it is purely/JLegal matter.Mr Churchill:    Signing this agreement in no way alters thegeneral position we have taken up as jtothe Bolsheviks,namely, that Ministers shall be free to point out the odiouscharacter of their regime.    It seems to me you are on thehigh road to embrace Bolshevism.    I am going to keep offthat and denounce them on all possible occasions.Lord Curzon referred to the question of the prisoners.   -04t of the total number of prisoners given either toChicherin direct or through Reval or krassin we have got
W:0. Form 2.PageFile No.out - British subjects 183, the number not got out of the list sent 210.     This includes 76 through Mrs Proom.The whole lot were put up to chicherin.      We have said wewould not sign the agreement until we got the prisoners.The Prime Minister: Here we are beginning again conditionsprecedent.     We may find that many are dead.Lord Curzon:    Those who can be identified as living.Mr Chamberlain:    We have said &quot;known prisoners.jilThe Prime Minister:    If the Cabinet said in process ofbeing brought forward&apos;.      Get that condition satisfied.It will take time to get the agreement, perhaps 6 ?/eeks.Sir Robert Horne:    People are looking to get the prisonersaway.Mr Churchill:    Statements have been made about them.The Prime Minister:    Horne and the Departments concerned should draft the agreement and shew it again to the Cabinet.Curzon, Churcill and MiNLher can put up something to Horne,Sir Robert Horne:    We will mention Kemal, Persia and afghanistan in the document which goes out with the agreement.The Cabinet decided that Sir Robert Horneshould circulate the draft agreement.November 18th 1920

THE LEAGUE01; &apos; NATIONSMEETING at brussels.INTER&quot;-ALL IE DAND ANGLO-&apos; AMERICANDEBTS.THE STATUSCP EGYPT.(1)  The Prime Minister, on behalf of his colleaguescongratulated and thanked Mr Balfour on the singularlysuccessful way in which he had represented British inter-eats at the recent meeting of the Council of the Leagueof Nations at Brussels,  and more particularly in connectionwith the question of the Court of International Justice.(2) With reference to Cabinet 30 (20), Conclusion 2,the Chancellor of tho Exchequer stated that the questionof Inter-Allied and Anglo-Ar.american debts had now becomeurgent* and&apos;ho had asked that it might be placed on theAgenda for that day.

A P P E N p I x.LORD MILF3E said that ho had been occupied for practicallyeleven months in considering the question of Egypt.    for four months it had taken up practically his whole time, andfor seven months the greater part of it.   Ke thought thateveryone would admit that if Egypt were a friendly and alliedcountry which was decently governed and able to stand on itsown feet, and if it were prepared to give us of its own- accorda strategic base at all times and to place its harbours,railways, and othsrbieans of communication at our service notonly in time of war but even in time of peace, it would bebetter, from the purely British point of view, than if Egyptwere to be a British Possession, kept in subjection by forceand requiring in time of peace a large permanent garrison.He-foresaw considerable danger if the present situation wereb connallowed to continue, h-ct it should &apos;*/   * a reproduction ofthat in Southern and Western Ireland. &apos;*       - It was rapidlymoving that way, and quite needlessly so.    The quarrel withthe Iris? people was really a secular one, whereas in Egyptthe trouble was really a new one and was, in his opinion,due to remedial causes.   He saw no reason why, with goodstatesmanship and patience, we should not get on the sametolerable terns with the Egyptians as we were twenty yearspreviously.    Even now there w s no very bad feeling amongstthe greater number of people in Egypt towards the British.The Fellahin did not really carequestion ,       &apos;        &apos;   .^ ., , .$bout any political /and this was even true of tho Fe&amp;lahinin the large towns.    In fact, it might be said that 9.0 percent, of the people in Egypt did not take very nfcoh Interestone way or the; other, and he was quite sure that a very largenumber of them did not know what the extremists were fightingfor.   To put it broadly,, the Fellah     neither loved nor hatedus, and,as he had always been governed by some-body, he was --1-
quite prepared tc acquiesce in being governed by us, so longas b.p- not bis water and his crops were not interfered with,and provided he v:as not stirred up against us by the socialsuperiors of his own race, and especially by the reiijioun/It might bo asked, in these circumstances, what was the causeof the outbreaks which tc^k place in Egypt last year?    Thesewtsre, in his (Lord Miner&apos;s) opinion, due to temporary causes,Th^yvswas largely-, due..h      things which went wrong in the government of thecountry during the War, when many of the best administratorswere ta&amp;en away;    also to the hardships which had to beendured in many cases, and to the re^Wisx Waning Vf/i%DoblmAll this had paused bad feeling.    The point he wished to emphasize, however, was that the Pellahin could be worked up against us by their social superiors;    and if we were to havepeace in Egypt and avoid having to maintain that peace bymartial law, it was not sufficient to have 9J per cent, ofready to ;,equiacc &apos; in our presence.  if lc-Pt alon^the people / It was essential to gem some of theremaining 10 per cent. - that was, the educated and semi-educated classes  - en fro--G^sfesfee our side.    This he consider-ed essential, for if we had some of the la per cent, on oursido they could make opinion and we could afford to leave therest.    In the years gone by we always had some of the middle and semi-educated classes who were favourable to british rule, and it had been the greatest shock to him, when hevisit&quot;d Egypt, to find out what a change had taken place inthe country.    The Nationalist movement had only begun about15 years ago, and it had been growing eve r since.    There wasl^o, of course, the unrest caused by the War and its inevit-. u.e results .He was not, however, going to labouthis point, as itrnvopid bo dealt with fully in the final report of his Commission;   but he did want to emphasize the -
strength of the spirit of Egyptian, l^tlon^lls^fh^ch/^^^u.the 10 p-r cent, of the population to which he was referring.Many men dreaded at heart the withdrawal of. British influencefrom Egypt, hut no man was prepared to stand up publicly and say that ho was in favour of ^protectorateno man was prepared to stand up and say that&quot; cor.pl - te independence&quot;he did not want . ./ If anybody was evensuspected of favouring in any way British rule, he was immp--dlately hauled over the coals and at once made to toe tholine and make a public confession of his orthodoxy.    the sultan himself had said once to Mm (Lord Milner) when he&apos;was -talking of his^weakness and unpopularity, that he c.guld.b*the most popular ran in Egypt on the following day if he.followed the example of the Princes and agreed with theirmanifesto.    It would thus be seen that we were up against--a..solid phalanx of Egyptian opinion, and in his (lord Milner&apos;s)view, if we were to keep any control over the country other--wise than by martial law we must break up the 10 per cent&quot;, ofthe more educated classes and g--.t some of them on our side.,-wen if, in order to do so, if was necessary to make some-oori-siderable sacrifices.    In the opinion of the      Idssion ofwhich he was Chairman, it would be possible to re-establishgenuine co-operation between the British and Egyptians inthe government of Egypt by giving to the latter, who forwo had professed to b-&apos;1 training toforty -ears past / &apos; govern themselves-,..tho same independent status which we contemplated giving tothe much less civilised Arabs in MasopeJaraia after a muchshorter period of tutelage,    He noticed that the Secretaryof State for India had suggested that his,    jgjiasicn had been.bargaining with the Egyptian extremists.    This was not so.Adly Pasha was essentially a moderate, and was not at allanti-British:   he had been more instrumental in bringing.. ab ou t/jo nv e rs a^x ons /^han: W no the r man in Egypt, and had &apos;.in his (lord Milnerhs) opinion the best political head in
that country.   All the men with whom the/h^d been carryingon conversations belonged to the old Hist-&apos;/Cmma, a partyfavoured, and it might almost be said created, by Lord Oromer.Zaghlul bins elf was one of Lord Grower1s men.    The Hlsb-el-Om.ua party used to be at daggers drawn with the Hisb9-/Watani,which was really the anti-British party.    The mistakes whichSgyrrt ianahad been made by us had led the /to think that be meant to destroy.entirely their nationality and their individualityas a people, and to swallow them up in the. British Empire.This feeling had brought the two parties together, and all nonjoined in the cry of &quot;No Protectorate&quot; and &quot;Long live eora-plete independence&quot;:,    As always happened in such combinations, .the extremists got the upper hand, but the deep underlyingdifference was still there.    On the one hand there ware thosewho neither thought they could do without us nor wanted to try, and who knew that if left to themselves they would fallunder some other much lass lenient domination, These menstill wanted to lean upon the British, Put not as subjects.They wanted to be able to hold their heads up in Egypt andwho wer&quot;g really anti-Britishnot to appear less patriotic, than, the extreme men /    he himself had bean one cf those who had recommended, after thenot       EgyptianWar,, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should/receive nmDelega-tion in London,  but he now realised that the refusal had done a good deal of harm anc/had given colour in Egypt to the idea that we not only wanted a Protectorate but that our intention     jrwas to absorb Egypt entirely into the British Empire.LORN CURZON pointed out that His MajestymS Government had never declined to receive Egyptian Ministers, but that theywere not prepared to receive Zaghlul, who was the leader ofthe party which was working against British rule.    TheMinisters had refused to oo--e without Zaghlul, and the pro-posed journey to London accordingly fell through.LORD MILNr&apos;R, continuing, said that the main effort of his mission had been directed towards finding a settlement -which, alike in form and in substance, would allow that-1-
section of the more educated Egyptian   classes which wasnot irreconcilable again to become-e our friends.    It wasnecessary to take into account the self-respect and nationalself-consciousness of the  egypt^Wr, one might say,tbaisccnoeit:.   and that was why the term &quot;Ei-lateral Agreement-had been used, as it implied the frank recognition of theirnationality, of th-ir having retained or regained a place oftheir own &quot;in the san&quot;,  their relation to us being that of allies, not subjects or fellow-citisena.    Throughout thediscussions phraseology and face-saving had played an enormouspart, a?? the      Kission realised that they were dealing withOrientals and with children, very clever and potentially verynaughty children, but also people who, once they were con-vineed of our sincerity and real good will towards them, were very manageable.    Some doubt had boon expressed as to whatwith whom the Missian had dealt aflW&amp;fextent the     Egyptians/represented Egyptian ^pinion, &apos; Therewas no question that they had evt-ry conceivable credentialthat unofficial emissaries could have.    Ther-- was practically no public body in Egypt which had not passed     resolutionssaying that Zaghlul represented their views, and there wasnof a &quot;ci&apos;0A raismi on Mr- oth-r side.    This was, however, whenZaghlul and his colleagues were supposed to advocate theextreme national demand.    The real question was how they wouldbe received when, they went back to Egypt to advocate the per-manent maintenance of a British Army in Egypt and the penman- jjent concentration of the exceptional rights of foreigners inBritish bands, typified by the dropping of the famous predi-cate &quot;complete&quot; from the formula &quot;independence&quot;&apos;.    So far ashe (Lord Milner) could make out, however, thoir .proposalsswept the board .    It. did not follow.     * that this feeling would continue, but he thought it reasonable to saythat the dominant feeling of hostility against the Britishin ^gypt had bf*n broken.   The old fissure was once moreapparent, and it was wider than ever.    &quot;Entente&quot; res the&apos;order of the -My,    nd for Mio eer ent the party of &quot;Entente&quot;
had completely got the upper head.     The practical question, was whetherthe price which the Kiaslon was prepared to recommend Great Britain\o pay for this separation of tho sheep from the goafs was too high.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire had quite clearly pointedout its weak points.     It had always heon made perfectly clear to the egyptians with whom hi3 (Lord riilnor&apos;o) mission had been dealing,that Hiu !.[njooty&apos;s Govornmicnt wore not commit tod in any way, althoughho personally and his colleagues wore committed to advocating a oottlo-mciat on the lines laid down in their memorandum of August last.THE PRIliB LINISTER said ho would like Lord milnbr to give a picture of what he thought would bo achieved under his proposals.     He wondered whether the Egyptians would bo prepared to take advice now in the same way as they did twenty years ago, for it must bo remembered that atthat time the situation was very different.     For example, tho egyptian government could not got any money, whereas now they probably would think that they could raise a loan just as well as anyone olsc.LORD MILKER said that his idea was that, under -Ills scheme, thesituation would revert to what it was twenty or &quot;thirty years ago, whentho British Government had much Ion,- actual powor iii Egypt but muchgroator influence.     Under the present arrangement tho. want of oo-operation between British and Egyptians threatened to bring thingsentirely to a standstill, and he thought wc would get much greatererficioncy   if wo gave up direct-control and relied more on influence.&apos;He did not thin]-; that anyone doubted for a moment that the egyptians would have to have come foreign help, and that they would preferBritish to any other.     But they certainly wanted groator freedom to run their domestic affairs on their own lines.     V:hon  he had beenin Egypt previously, wc confined our direct action to finance andirrigation.     It was a later and much more doubtful development when we began to take charge of all branches of administration especially the interior.
A short discussion then ensued regarding the system whichhad been in vogue in Prrypt in years gone by,  during whichit was pointed out that pis Majesty&apos;a Government exercised avery great control, in no far as they only allowed those ministers to be appointed who were prepared to carry out apolicy in accord with the British point of vicwi    The point was also raised as to what extent it would be necessary, underthe proposals for the Egyptian Government to take the advice of the British officials in Egypt,  and as to whether, if they wanted an engineer or a man to ran the railways, it would bepossible to insist on their employing British officials andnot prench or American; and,  again,  as to whether,  if they wanted officers for the Egyptian Army,   they might not saythat the French knew much more about military matters thanthe British and that they wanted to employ French officers,LORD MILNER explained that, under the general lines of thescheme as already outlined,  this was not expressly barred,,  butit certainly would not be in accordance with the,spirit of theAgreement that British officials should be replaced by otherforeigners.   He believed that the Egyptians would readily agreeto give a pledge to that effect.LORE CURZON,  in reply to a question by the prime Minister,explained the system of control over Native states in india as regards their military forces and the employment of foreignofficials.   He suggested that in the case of Egypt the best way would surely be to lay down certain conditions, and ex-pressly to state that if foreign officers were required theycould only be appointed with the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,MR, BONAR LAW asked if anyone could say what views were held by British officials, at present serving in Egypt, on lord Milner*s proposals.   He would like to know,  for example,was opinion unanimous that they would not work?
LORD ALLENBY said that he thought opinion was unanimousthat something in the nature of Lord Milner&apos;s scheme wouldhe quite workable, but he would like to point out that thisview was held before the scheme provided for representation in &quot;oreic&quot; countries, and he thought most of the british officials in Egypt would be very shy of this provision.LORD MILNER said he did not thinkthat the system under which an Egyptian Minister hadcontrol, with British Civil Servants working under him,would not work,    Egypt remained overshadowed by Britishpo^er,  and he believed they were much better disposed to usthan to anyone else.    There was also the question of theaccessibility of Egypt by sea, and with our sea power we. could do practically what we liked strategically.   Moreover, by her own act we were to have a permanent base in Egypt.   As regardsit must be rembrbierbd that under th*9 cronosed scheme the possibility of foreign intrigues in Egypt,/Q&amp;q ^asto have an Alliance with us, and with us only.Mr BONAR LAW thought that, with good will on the part ofthe Egyptians, the proposed scheme might work, but if not,it appeared to him to be hopeless.   He very much doubted 4 th.  fourteen foreign Powers who had Capitulatery rights would be willing to agree to the proposals.    He did not think.**or a moment that if the British Government were in theplacrt o^ one of th-se power they would do so.Some discussion then ensued,  during which considerable doubt was expressed as to how,,under the proposed scheme, itwould be possible to prevent the French or any other foreign power from.intriguing in Egypt and gradually strengtheningth^ir position.The question v.-as also discussed as to the extent to whichHis Majesty&apos;a Govern1., ent would be responsible for providingtroops for the maintenance of internal order in Egypt andthe protection of the property of foreigners in the case ofthe Egyptian Army proving unreliable.
It v:as. alG^oirrt^-ou^^^ nev-r be- -exactly--what it was in years gone by, and that, after allthat had passed, the present and future High commissioners in Egypt could never hold the same position as Lord Cromerhad in the past.LORD MILKER said that there was only one thing which he still intend- d- to say when certain questions had been asked.He had been very careful to impress on the Egyptian Delegationthat he vas talking qua Mission, and could not speak for theGovernment any mo-a than the Egyptian del-gates could speakfor the Egyptian Government.    He was of opinion that his.Mis-sion was committed to reporting in favour of some scheme onthe lines indicated in their Interim Report, but His Majesty&apos;sGovernment wore, of course, not committed in any way.   Hishope, hoover, was that they right see fit to approve, withcertain reservations, r- lotions with the Egyptian Governmenton the lines contemplated, rather than on the lines of the relationship of a Colony or Protectorate to the Home Govern-ment.   The next step would have to be to appoint representa-tives on both sides to draw up some formal document.   &apos; Sarah ^.i&quot;beTreaty when drafted would have  to/^^mitted to the EgyptianAssembly.    Regarding reservations, he had looked through Lord,Curzon&apos;s remarks, and he thought most of his proposals were quite in accordance with the spirit of the scheme.    Therewere, however, one or two of them which, if adopted, mightupset it altogether.    Regarding the military forces, to beretained in Egypt, and the keeping open of our lines of com-munication to tho.East,&apos; he did not think that this had beenvery clearly expressed in the Memorandum.    The basis of thewhole thing was an Alliance in which we guaranteed Egyptianindependence and the sending of an Army to protect Egyeo  it need be;    in return for this we demanded a valuable quid pro.   -qUo. namely, that in war all her local resources should beplaced at our -disposal;   and, further, that we should have apermanent military base in Egypt. &apos; . .
Rega rding.the point raised by Lord Our-aon in connec tion* with officers other than British serving in the Egyptian Army, he did notthink that anyone had ever contemplated that any but british officers should be employed.    It was merely a question ofthe form in which the Agreement should be drawn up.    Itmight be made a general principle that any foreigner employ-ed in the Public Service&apos;&apos; in Egypt mast be a Britisher, or-Ise appointed wdth the consent of the British Government.He did not think a stipulation of this sort would entirelyupset the agreement, and it would be possible to get them toagree to it..A short discussion then trek place with regard to the best means of further considering the question, during which itwas pointed out that, as the hauling down of the British Flagin Egypt and turning Egypt into an Independent State was avery serious proposal, it was desirable that the general principles should be decided before the. details were dis-cussed.The Conference agreed to adjourn thediscussion until the morning of Thursdayn**xt, November 4.-th,Vhitehal 1 Ca gardens , 3.

With reference to-Cabinet 59 (go), Appendix IY (2), thequestion before the Conference  was that of Second Chambersfor the Northern and Southern Irish Parliaments.    The Con-feronce were reminded of the following statements made bymr Walter Long on Hay 18, 1920, in the House of Commons&quot;In the view of the Government, if you areto ha^e a Second Chamber in the southern parliament, you must obviously have aSecond Chamber equally in the NorthernParliament.    If you are to accept theprinciple that there is to be protection for minorities by s^n,e provision in this bill, and if that is to take the form ofa Second Charber,  it must apply to theBill as a whole, and not be limited onlyto one part of it.    V,&apos;hat the government propose to do now is definitely to acceptthe principle of the Second Chamber forthe two Irish Parliaments, both in southern and in Northern Ireland&quot;.&quot;The Government undertake, between now andReport, to place on the Paper a definitesphere for the constitution of the second chamber in both Southern and NorthernIreland&apos;&apos;.It now transpired that Sir Edward Carson and the UlsterMembers were strongly opposed to a Second Chamber for theNorthern Parliament, and would use the whole weight of their opposition to endeavour to defeat the proposal.It was stated that the reasons  for a Second Chamber toprotect minorities were no less strong now than they hadbeen in the past.At fiist there was a general kind of agree-:.ent that itwas undesirable to have a Second Chamber for the southern parliament and not for the Northern.The alternatives before tho Conference were, therefore,as follows(i)  To disregard the opposition of.Ulsterand to set up a Second Chamber for theNorth-rn as well as for the southern parliament:(ii) no&apos; drop the proposal for Second Chambersaltogether.After considerable discussion and a short adjournment,the following proposal was made:-That provision should be included inthe Bill that the Council of Ireland,
which was a common meeting ground of re-preservatives both of the&quot; Northern and southern Parliaments, should have...theduty of drawing up a scheve for theestablishment of Second Chambers in bothareas for the protection of minori-ties.    This&quot; scheme should then be remitted to the Ncrthr-m and Southern Parliamentsand should be subject to their approval.If either did not approve the schemethere would be no Second Chambers.It was pointed out that this proposal had the -merit thatit gave room for a bargain between the two parties for thepurpose of providing for the minorities in the North andS ou th res em- c tiv ply.An alternative suggestion was that Second Chambers shouldbe set up for a period of five years and should be continuedthereafter unless the Imperial Parliament decided otherwise.There was then some discussion as to the Second schedule of Paper CP.-2050, containing proposals  for a Senate ofNorthern Ireland, which were severely criticised on theground that there was not sufficient protection for there1igious mino ri ty.The discussion then reverted to the first alternative scheme outlined above.    It was suggested that this night be modified by permitting the South of Ireland to have its ownSecond Chamber irrespective of the decision taken by theNorth.    In this  connection it was pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that the South would decide for aSecond Chamber except as part of a bargain providing for theprot-ction of the Catholic minority in the North.    It wasthe incentive: of the protecting of minorities/in the other part o^ Ireland which would actuate both North and South -toagree upon a scheme of Second Chambers.In the course of this discussion it transpired that theBill made no provision for the summoning of the Council ofIreland.After some further discussion it. was agreed  (a) ^hat provision should be made in the Billf(,r thfi summoning of the Council of ireland by the Lord Lieutenant:
(b)   That tho Council shall hava tha duty of preparing a scheme for the establishmentof second Chambers suitable for theNorthern&apos;and Southern ParliamentsI which need not be identical.(a)   That tho sohome should ba subject to theapproval of tha northern and. Southern,Parliaments.(d)   That, in the event of amendments beingproposed by either the northern orSouthsrn Parliamentsit should bepossible to brint, tho question e^ainbefore tho Council of Ireland, whichshould bo the bargaining body.Z V/hitshall gardens, S.W.I.3rd Hovambor, 19 0.

i Dtt.M.OMATICnvi^UESENTA(1)   With reference to War Cabinet 631, Conclusion 1,tqjt at TEE   arising out of a Question in Parliament, it was agreedVAx iC All that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have authority to retain the British Diplomatic representative at the Vatican*LEAGUE CF) 1 NATIONS.I QuestionsI in Parlia-I rnc-int inI regard tcI the BrusselsI Councils(2)   The attention of the Conference was called toa series of Questions addressed to the Prime minister on subjects discussed at the recent meeting of tho Councilof the League of Nations,It was agreed  That -lr.Balfour should deal with theseQuestions on the basis of making theresolutions of the Council and thepertinent Memoranda available for members of Parliament at the earliestpossible moment.THE STATUS OF     (3)     The Conference resumed the discussion on theS EGYPT.status cf Egypt, initiated at the meeting held onNovember 1st.After Lord Milner had made some importantcorrections in the draft summary attsched to the Con-elusions of the previous meeting, the discxission wasresumedQIn regard to the proposal that Egypt should enjoy the right to representation in foreign countries,apprehensions were expressed that this would give too great an opportunity for anti-British Intrigues byPowers with interests or traditional ambitions in EgyptoL-c,rd Milnor made if clear that the omission ofthis provision would1be contrary to the spirit and lettercf the scheme, and t?iat no scheme which omitted it couldbe carried through any representative Egyptian assembly *It was pointed out, however, that british control over Egyptian foreign relations was safeguardedin groat measure by tho provision&quot;that Egypt should enter into no agreement with a foreign Power which was   &apos;prejudicial to British interestssIt was explained that the Egyptians attached gref
importance to representation on the League of Nations andon International Conferences on all questions, technical orotherwise.   This was one of the reasons for the insertion of the provision under discussion.The trend of the discussion was in the direction, thatsome alternative must be found to our present position inEgypt, the maintenance of which required the presence of elarge military force, and this even though,  as foreshadowedby the Secretary of State for War, considerable reductions in the present force of 15,000 to 16,000 men might provepracticable,    he question for consideration was whetherLcrcl MilnerJs proposed alternative was the best possible.This led to considerable discussion on the military aspects, and the question was asked as to how the size ofthe garrison would compare on the alternative assumptions  (i)    that the present state of affairs continued,and(ii)    that the proposals of Lord Milner&apos;s Commis-sion were adopted and received only a mod-erate degree of general acceptance by theEgyptian people.Field-Marshal Lord Allenby stated that, under the Corn-mission^ proposals, the British forces at Ismalia (whereLord Milner suggested they would be stationed) would be atthe Egyotlans since their water-aupply would be at the mercy ofthe mercy of/Cairo which must be considered the heart ofEgypt from a military point of view.    He laid great stress,therefore, on the maintenance of a British forse in Cairo.If no British troops were kept there, he felt certain that foreign nations, Including the Americans, would probablyinsist on the provision of Legation Guards.    Otherwise,the High Commissioner and other Europeans in Cairo would beat the mercy of any seditious movement.Questioned as to his views on the scheme as a whole,Lord Allenby (who was due to leave for Egypt on the following day) stated that he.did not like the manner in which negotiations
\- it ^had been.-carried, out with Zaghlul, who is our enemy,instead of with the Egyptian Government.   He felt, however,that we were now to a considerable extent committed tothe scheme, a view which did not meet with unanimous con-currence in the Conference .   Lord Allenby attached greatimportance to a future procedure supporting our friendsinstead of trying vainly to conciliate our enemies.   among our friends are the present Egyptian Ministry, who wouldthen In all probability give us their loyal support in theexecution of the scheme.   At the present time the Egyptianswere coming to realise that they were receiving fair-playfrom the British, both In internal and in foreign affairs.Unless, however, they received a large measure of autonomy,they would consider that they had been betrayed, as, eventhough wrongly, they regarded Lord Milner as a plenipotentiary.Lord Allenby attached great importance to the fact that theBritish Government had guaranteed to uphold the Sultan andhis dynasty.   This committed them to some degree of inter-ference in the affairs of Egypt.    In his experience the sultan, though unpopular, was a shrewd man and an. honestman, who would support us if we supported him.    If we failedto give such support, we should, earn the contempt of our enemies and the hostility of our friends.    He urged that anyarmy of occupation must be 5ritish.   The conduct of theIndian troops had been unexceptionable,* but the Egyptiansdislikod the long-continued presence of coloured troops.Subject to these remarks, Lord Allenby was not opposed toLord Milner&apos;s proposals, as a basis for consideration inconsultation with a representative Egyptian Delegation tobe nominated by the Sultan; but he regarded as essential theretention for the present of troops in Cairo.The question was then discussed as to whether theproposed British force was sufficient to enable us to maintainthe dynasty. .
The Frlme Minister, with.the agreement of his colleagues,impressed on Lord Allenby that he ahould make it clear inEgypt that the British Government was not finally committed to the scheme.   Egypt was not bound by the adherence ofZaghlul and his colleagues to the proposals, and knew thatshe was perfectly free to examine them and to suggest amend-ments .    The position of the British Government was preciselysimilar; it was merely in process cf examining and considering,a scheme presented to them only in the form of a summary bythe Commission which had drawn it up.    The Prime minister made it&apos; clear that the question cf whether the Governmentwould exercise Its freedom was a question cf policy to beconsidered later.Lord Allenby made it perfectly clear that he would bsobliged, in conversation with the Sultan, to enter into thequestion in some detail.This ltd to a discussion as to the nature of the Dele-gation, representing all shades of Egyptian opinion, which itwas proposed,, as the next step, should be sent by the egyptian government to London.   It was pointed out that it was ssoeontialto make clear to this Delegation whether it was todiscussdetails of a scheme already accepted in principle, ormerely to reopen the whole question.Lord Milner pointed out that, notwithstanding the boycott of his Mission in Egypt, it had in the end succeeded in eliciting the attitude of all shades of Egyptian opinion.i-t was generally agreed that no decision could be taken at the moment as to the precise purpose of the proposedDelegation.   The procedure should be somewhat as follows :-(a) Consideration by the Cabinet of lord milner s Report ;(b) A decision by the Cabinet on thequestion of policy;
(c)    If that decision v/ere of a character to render such procedure desirable, the reception of a Delegation,  appointed bythe Egyptian Government,  to discussthe details of the British Government&apos;sd eci si oh .Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.,November 4, 1920.

2&quot; 1. With reference to Home Affairs Committee 75, Minute 4, theCommittee had again under consideration the Wireless Telegraphy (and Visual Signalling Bill (C.P.-1593). The Committee had already approved the Bill as a whole, which gives powers to the Postmaster-General to secure control of wireless telegraphy installations soas to reduce interference with communications to a minimum. BySection 3 (3) of &quot; The Wireless Telegraph Act, 1904,&quot; there waspower by Order in Council to apply that Act to all British shipswhen on the high seas, and from this the Colonial Office desired to exempt ships registered in the Dominions by the amendmentsreferred to at the last meeting of the Committee : &quot; &apos; The Wireless Telegraph Act, 1904,&apos; as amended by theBill under consideration, should not extend to the British ships or British aircraft registered in the self-governing dominions of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia (including for thispurpose the territory of Papua and Norfolk Island), theDominion of New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and newfoundland, while outside the British Islands and theterritorial waters abutting on the coast thereof.&quot;The Solicitor-General observed that the vessels referred to inthe Colonial Office amendment would remain British vessels, andacquired considerable status thereby. It would be unfortunate thata vessel registered in one of the Dominions should be enabled, whenonly 4 or 5 miles from Great Britain, to interfere with wirelesscommunications with this country without our being able to resort to the powers contained in the Bill. He therefore suggested the alteration proposed in his observations (Memorandum by the solicitor-General, 17.D 40-2), that the power should be exercised over Dominion ships, except when within the territorial waters ofthe Dominion in question.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade (sir. Lloyd Greaine) stated that in all recent Merchant Shipping Actswe had legislated to take control of Dominion ships only when inBritish ports, and the proposed Colonial Office amendment wastherefore in accordance with the tendency of modern legislation.The Solicitor-General suggested that the application of theBoard of Trade regulations was not a parallel case. The powers over wireless telegraphy were to be used in an emergency in a stateof some peril.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the powers of theprincipal Act were of general application, and did not arise only inan emergency. (Section 1 (1) and Section 3 (3) &quot; Wireless TelegraphAct, 1904.&quot;)Sir Henry Lambert on behalf of the Colonial Office stated thatthe Act of 1904 was an anachronism. It had never been enforcedagainst the Dominions, and it would not be possible to enforce it.The Order in Council applying the Act to British ships on the high seas in February 1908; made persons on board ships registeredoutside the British Islands exempt if the ships were equipped witha wireless telegraph installation, licensed by the Dominion or Colonyin which it was registered. In substance, therefore, the Act had never been applied to ships registered in the Dominions. At aConference with the Dominion Governments in 1907, the ImperialGovernment had deliberately abandoned the claim to legislate forDominion ships, and a number of Acts had since been passed inwhich this was clearly recognised. Similarly, in the case of theAir Navigation Bill now before Parliament, Dominion aircraft wereexempted ; objection had in fact been taken by the canadian government on the ground that the Bill as first drafted was legis-lating for Dominion aircraft. The policy pursued by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment under modern conditions in all such cases was to ask the Dominion Governments to pass legislation on similar lines, a request with which they were generally quite ready to comply.wireless telegraphy andVisual SignallingBill.
Any attempt to claim a position long ago abandoned would merely,when discovered, evoke protests from the Dominions in face ofwhich the claim would have to be dropped.The suggestion was put to the Committee that if the wireless telegraph Act was not applicable to ships registered in theDominions, it would be possible for a body of Sinn Feiners, or otherevilly-disposed persons, to charter a ship registered in one of theDominions, bring it to the English Channel, and then proceed tojam all wireless communications with this country, and we shouldhave no legal power to restrain them.It was pointed out to the Committee that acceptance of theColonial Office amendment in practice meant the abrogation of aprovision of an Act of the Imperial Parliament of 1904, and involved the acceptance by Parliament of the principle that the imperial parliament could not legislate for Dominion shipping.The Committee were generally agreed that a point of con-stitutional importance of such magnitude was raised, that thematter must be considered by the Cabinet.The Committee accordingly decided : To request Sir Henry Lambert to provide the Chairmanwith a memorandum setting out the Colonial Office view for presentation to the Cabinet.Jsle of Man 2. The Committee had  under consideration a note by the(Customs) Bill.        Financial Secretary to the Treasury (C.P.-2055) covering a draftof a Bill to amend the law with respect to customs in the isle of Man.The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill and to authorise its introduction into Parliament.Public Works Loan 3. The Committee had under consideration a note by theBill. Chancellor of the Exchequer (O.P.-1985) covering the draft of aBill to grant money for the purpose of certain local loans out of theLocal Loans Fund, and for other purposes relating to local loans.The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill and to authorise its introduction into Parliament.Unemployment 4. With reference to Home Affairs Committee 75, Minute 3,Relief Works Bill     the Committee had under consideration the further draft of a Bill(Acquisition of        to authorise Government  Departments and  local  authorities toacquire land for the purpose of carrying out thereon works ofpublic utility with a view to finding immediate employment forunemployed persons.It was explained that the Bill had been redrafted on the linesdirected by the Committee at their last meeting so as to vest theMinistry of Transport or other appropriate Departments with powers of acquiring land by compulsion analogous to those of theMinistry of Health in respect of land required for housing.The Bill did not authorise the acquisition of land for any purpose for which land could not already be acquired compulsorily(clause 1 (c)), that is to say, its main object was to simplify andaccelerate procedure by enabling the Ministry of Transport to make use of the same procedure as that adopted by the Ministry of Healthunder &quot; The Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890,&quot; and laterActs relating thereto, including &quot; The Housing Act, 1919,&quot; whichdispensed during a period of two years from the passing of thatAct with, the necessity for a local enquiry into proposals for theacquisition of land against the wishes of the owner thereof.The Committee considered whether it was desirable to retainclause 1 (b), which would enable the Ministry of Transport to
dispense with such local enquiry during a period of two years fromthe passing of the Bill under consideration instead of two years from the passing of &quot; The Housing Act, 1919.&quot;After some discussion the Committee were of opinion that clause 1 (6) should be omitted, in view of the fact that the land tobe acquired for the arterial road schemes of the Ministry ofTransport would be acquired during the next few months, and thatit was undesirable to ask Parliament to consent to a further extension of the somewhat arbitrary methods which had been necessary under war legislation and on which the Courts hadseverely commented.The Committee accordingly agreed- To approve the draft Bill, subject to the omission of clause 1 (b), and to authorise its introduction into Parliamentforthwith by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofTransport.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,November 5, 1920.

had a greater chance of development under private enterprise than if undertaken by the State. This applied especially at the present moment when the chancellor of the Exchequer was not likely to be able to assist the Post Office to any great extent if they undertook the work.

On the other hand it was pointed out that the Government already possessed two Wireless Stations and were in contract for another, so that they were in a favourable position for commencing a wireless service with 

European countries. With regard to grants from the Exchequer, it was stated that the Post Office could carry on without any very big additional expenditure for some little time to come.

Attention was drawn to the fact that arrangements had been made with certain foreign governments not to give any concessions to private wireless companies without prior consultation with the Government concerned and it was agreed that this question should be considered before any licences were granted to private companies.

The Conference agreed, subject to the Post Master General also expressing his approval.

(a) that subject to a definite and a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at with the Marconi Co. regarding all the Company&apos;s oustanding claims against His Majesty&apos;s Government, and to a satisfactory understanding as to the future use of Marcend patents, the Company should be granted licences to erect the necessary stations in the United Kingdom to conduct wireless traffic with foreign countries: but that in no circumstances were they to be given a monopoly.

(b) that, subject to the Post Master General cencurring in the conclusion,  in (a) above, endeavours should be made to negotiate an agreement with the Marconi Company.

(c) that the Secretary to the General Post Office should inform Lord Milner as soon as possible what arrangements (if any) had been made with the governments of foreign countries as regards not granting concessions to private companies without prier consultation with the government concerned.
