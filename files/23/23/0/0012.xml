vflficiAX BX- (1)    Arising out of a ^sjra^siou-at-.^^on Finance on the previous evening,, the Cabinet had underconsideration certain Draft Resolutions on Economy, whichhad been prepared with a view to their being announced bytha Chancellor of th&quot; Exchequer in his speech in the debate on national Expenditure in the House of Commons on Thursday,December 9th.After considerable discussion, .th;- Draft resolutions were approved by the Cabinet, subject to certain altera-tions and modifications..   The Resolutions as approved byfK-&apos; Cabinet ar&quot;       follows:-
p E C R E T. DRAFT RESOLUTIONS ON ECONOMY. J 4(Approved by the Cabinet, December 8th, 1950),In pursuance of their policy of reducing national expenditure the Cabinet are acting upon the following principles In preparing tha Budget for the financialyear 1921-28General (1)     Whilst recognising that there are many reformsthat are In themselves desirable in order toimprove conditions in the United Kingdom, theCabinetj having regard to the exceptionally heavy taxation      the inevitable consequenceof the War      the high cost of material, and thetrade reaction that has set in and the emergency measures thereby required to mitigate the hard-ships of unemployment, consider that to theextent that such reforms Involve further burdensupon the Exchequer or the Rates the time is notopportune for Initiating them or putting them Intooperation..     It is an instruction, therefore;, to allspending Departments that, except with fresh cabinet authority, schemes involving expenditure not yet inoperation are to remain in abeyance.     This general principle applies to all spending Departments butexception must be made for such temporary measuresa*s   are neceasary for dealing with the special problem of unemployment,l&apos;he sums which can be saved by the abovemeans would not, in the aggregate, amount to avery substantial figure, even if all these reformswere completely arrested and the only methodof effecting savings on a considerable scale .v,is in the War Departmentse.1.
Winding.      (2)     The Ministries of Munitions, Shipping &quot;and Food &quot;willcertain both be wound up this financial year and any outstandingDepartmentscreated &quot;    functions will be discharged by other Ministers,duringtrie 5ar.(3)     The Cabinet are convinced of the necessity ofMilitary     curtailing military expenditure to the utmost extentSxpendjllure, compatible with the fulfilment of our Imperialobligations and national safety.     The principal field for economy is in the Hear and Middle Ease, and theposition In these regions is being fully explored witha view to further and drastic reductions of&apos;expenditure the moment the situation permits.&apos;Tire Government of Persia has already been,notified of our intention to withdraw the last of theBritish forces from that country in the coming springsThe force in Palestine is already In course of reduction.In Mesopotamia, the aim of the British Governmenthas always been to develop the resources of this region, to set up an Arab Government and to replace the Imperial forces by an Arab Army,       Inaccordance with this policy the forces there hadalready been reduced from 222,000 men, at the time.of -the;Armistice, to 79,000 men by July, 1920, andwere in process of further rapid reduction, whenthe outbreak of a serious rebellion, fomented from outside Mesopotamia, necessitated their reinforcement.Even if the Government had decided to withdraw from mesopotamia and. leave tho country to its fate it Isby no means certain that this cource was possibleas a military operation, certainly it was notpossible without heavy losses in life and stores.There was therefore no choice but- to reinforce&apos; thegarrison and suppress the rebellion.     This task has. 1- *8*i-
been almost accomplished, and simultaneously with the suppression oi&apos; the remnants of the rebellion, Sir percy cox,  the High Coirrnissloner, is aotively engaged inthe creation of an Arab grate and the provisionalGovernment. lj:.- pressing forward the creation of an ArabArmy, which will provide a substitute for the british forces,     Te hope that, within a reasonable time, an arab Government will have taken over the administration and defence, the Imperial forces will have been reducedto &amp; small nucleus garrison, and Mesopotamia, a country with great potential resources, will be self-supporting,,(4) While determined to maintain the Navy at a standardof strength which shall adequately secure the safety ofthe Empire and its maritime communications, the cabinet before sanctioning a programme of new construction are bound to satisfy themselves that the lessons cf the war have been definitely ascertained, more particularly as .regards the place aid usefulness of the capital ship in future Naval operation;;,- and the Admiralty welcome this decision -They have, therefore, decided/that the Committee ofImperial Defence shall Institute at 01139 an exhaustiveinvestigation into the whole quest/ion of naval strengthas affected by the latest developments of naval warfare,They will present no programme of capital ship construe-tion to Parliament until the results of this enquiryhave been considered.(5)    The utmost economy will be enforced in theadministration of the Air Programme, and the positionand functions of the Royal Air Force will be examined in relation to the Navy and. Army.Whitehall Gardens, S.RVDecember 8th 1920.
(2) In th- course of tha&quot;precede diff^doubt was generally felt as to the necessity for maintaining the present large military forces in Palestine.    It -as repre-sented that, in the view of the Imperial General Staff, these forces had been required to uoot a possible Arab revolt,- ora co. bination bcteoen the Arabs and Mustapha Kenal.    these forces v;ere now being reduced.    In this connection it waspointed out that, according to the most recent information,the country was very quiet, and the relations between the feusand the Moharanedans better than they had. been for many years.It was succr-st-ftd that, instead o^ hoe-ping large forces at theexpens? o* the Exchequer, an,  arrangement should be made withthe righ Oo/wmissioner under which the Exchequer should rrakehim a grant-in-aid for military expenditure of, say, 2,000,0,00 or  3,000,000 per annum.    On the other hand, itwas pointed out that the military situation in Palestine couldnot very w?ll be settled without reference to the military position in Egypt, and that it was desirable to have a reasonedstatement of the present military position in Palestine fromthe Office.. COHu-andihg the troops in that country.It was - agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should eo..ieuni^ate. with SirHerbert Samel, warning Mm of the viewso^ the Cabinet, and intiratj ng that itwould probably be necessary to insist ona drastic reduction o    the -forces nowstationed in Palestine:(b) That the Secretary of State &quot;or War should circulate a survey of the rilitary situa-tion in Palestine, with a reason-d state, out as to the strength of the garrison center-.-plated.
(3) During the discussion on National Expenditure, it wassuggested by the Secretary for Scotland that there should bea fresh Enquiry into local ta-ation.The Chancellor V&quot; the Exchequer said that he wo3Hdd^ca-te any n- Enquiry in the- cas - of England.    Such an enquiry would rarely give rise to scheme  f0., thrusting the burdens now borne by the ratepayers on to the taxpayers.    he realised, however,  that the problem in Scotland  was different.It was agreedThat the Secjr-tary -&apos;or Scotland should circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandumon the question of, an Enquiry intolocal Taxation in Scotland.(4) With reference to Cabinet 66 (20), Conclusion 4,&apos;5   the Cabinet further considered the suggestion that unem-ploywent nilght be relieved in certain areas by placing theindustrial establishments of the Government on short time,as was usually done by the textile trades of the country.It was stated,  on behalf of the Admiral!\-    that atthe end of the winter it was proposed to discharge 8,000men v&apos;ho were now employed on civilian contracts, and thatif unemployed men wore now taken on temporarily there wouldbe difficulty in discharging then, lat-xr on.The Cabinet were impressed with r.he importance ofthe Government setting an example in this matter to.LocalAuthorities and private employers.&apos;nhe Cabinet agrsed  (a) To accept the principle of short timefor Government dockyards, arsenalsand national factories:(b) To ask Sir L, f/orthlngton Bvans,1 inconsultation with the Cabinet Commit-two on Unemploy ent, to draft a reso-lution for consideration by the cabinet for aivinn effect to the principle of short time.....as a moans of absorbing someof the unemployed&apos;:(c) To ask the Minister of Health to coh-sider the possibility of applying thesame orinciple to men ei ployed on theconstruction of sewers and roads in preparation fo r Housing Schemes.
-VITIATIONSBIIINIKGif- lT)Z UN1 on *(6) Attention was called to a question to be asked by Sir */.Davison in the House of Commons that after-Pirli&amp;wentary noon on the progress of negotiations for diluting theQuestions.Building Trade Unions with unemployed ex-service men.The Cabinet agreed  :-That the Minister of Labour should replystating that the Government hope to meetrepresentatives of the Building CraftUnions next we sic and asking Sir ir/,Davisonto repeat his question in a week&apos;s time,and should promise that,  in any ease., theGovernment&apos;s policy would be laid beforethe House before the Adjournment.$EMPLOYMENT.Third InterimEeport.(6) The consideration of the Third Interim Reportof the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment (paper C.P.-2202) was postponed.g Whitehall Gardens, S.vv.l.December 8, 1920.
