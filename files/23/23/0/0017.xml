(1) With reference to Conclusion 2 of a Conference ofMinisters held on December 15, 1980, the Prime minister informed the Cabinet that Lord St. Davids had expressed his willingness to take the Chair at the new Committee on Unem-pl&amp;yment.After a short- discussion in regard to the membershipef the Cemmittee^ it was ngreod -Te add General Lord Byng as a representa-tive of the ex-Service men to the Committee,the full eorapositien of which will be asfellpwsLord St. Davids (Chairman),Mr Frederick. Palmer,Mr P.J, bybus?Mr JoMn Bell,Sir Je Ferguson,Sir Thomas Munro, -Mr Ro0. Norman,General Lord Byng.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to make the formal appointments forthwith,and to nominate, a Secretary, in order thatthe Committee might get to work at once,(2) The Cabinet had a short dieeussion in regard to thestatement tc be made by tho Minister of Labour in regardte the establishment of the new Committee, a draft of whichhad been circulated before the mooting (Paper C.P.-2S15).The Cabinet agreed - That the Minister of Labour should rakethe fo11owing announc oment:-&quot;   1 -The Government has decided to appoint a Committee, under, the Chairmanship ofLord St* Davids, at whose dispositionthey will ask- Parliament to place a suraof  3,000,000 for the purpose of assist-ing Local Authorities in carrying outapproved schemes cf useful work, etherthan work on Roads and on Rousing Schemes,for which special arrangements have b^enor may be made.The selection of the schemes to be assisted and the amount, of the assistanceto be given in any particular case willbe decided by the Committee, who will be instructed, in coming to a decision, to observe the following general prrnciples:-(1) The expenditure is not to-.exceed atotal of  3,000,000.&apos; -1-   . m. m
(2) Works will bo approved-cndy in^rreaarTirhe^^.the existence of serious unomployi ent whichis not otherwise provided for is&quot;certified by the Ministry of Labour.(3)  Preference in eaplftywnt must Ve given tounemployed ex-Service r.en.(a)  x-he grant must not in any case exceed 30per cent, of the wages bill o - unemployedmen taken on for work.(5) The works must be such as are approved bythe appropriate Department of the Govern-rent as suitable works of public utility.Any application for assistance   by theLocal Authority should be addressed inthe first instance to the Secretary ofthe Committee.    The names of the Committeewill be published at a later date, togetherwith particulars of the detailed arrangements to be made by Local Authorities *theblic An- (3)   While the advantages of/wide publicity in the Saturdaylineament.and Sunday Press which a statement made on a Friday wouldyreceive were not lost sight of, it was generally agreed  That it would be advisable to introduce theabove announcement as part of a general statement on Unemployment, ar opportunityfor which would arise on Tuesday next,December 21st.
wipn rorerenco to Cabinet 66 (SO), Appendix I (3),the Cabinet had bvforv thsiri th- following documents in regardto the condition of Austria:-A Memorandum by the Chonc- smaller o^ thoFxch-quor (Paper CP.-2159),Note of Int-rview between Mr Chamberlain,Sir II, Levlck and Sir W, Good&quot; (Pao^-rC.P.-2157),A M-morrnduro by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP,-8276),A Telegram from kr Lindloy to the Socre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs;. No.431O-p December 16, 1920.The evidence before the Cabinet was to the effect thatAustria was on the verge of&apos;complete economic collapse, andin the absence of some assistance would probably fall into astate of dissolution.    This might lead to either the whole ora part linking itself to Germany, a contingency which theFrench viewed with the utmost misgivings, but on which nodecided views were expressed at the Cabinet.It was generally felt that if Austria were to be helped the only satisfactory method mould be one which would graduallyre-establish permanent economic stability in Austria,    On this line of thought proposals were made somewhat on the lines sug-^estmd in a recent discussion on Unemployment (Cabinet 69(20), Conclusions 1 &amp; 2) for at one stroke reducing unemploy-mont in this country and enabling Austria and other parts of central Europe to re-establish economic equilibrium by somescheme of insurance which would enable the bankers to give long-credits 8(TTrP chancellor-smaller of the Fx chequer handed theSecretary, for circulation, a Memorandum bySir Villiam Goode, bearing, on those aspectsof the question,)The Cabinet were inforred of certain successful comrcer-cial operations which had been launched in Austria in thecourse of the last twelve months.   We had been able to su plyAustria with raw materials in return for manufactured goods to be deli^pred to us over a long period.    It should be pos-sible to extend this system of long credits not only by meansof raw mat-rials but by means o* an insurance scheme by whichthe bulk of the risk would be taken by the banks and traders;^
2i 5 5but some portion of the risk would be borne in co-operationwith them by the Government.It was pointed out that Prance and Italy were verydirectly concerned in the future of Austria, and that theymight be prepared to modify their rights of reparation insuch a way as to assist Austrian credit.    It was suggestedthat the initiative in coring to the aid of Austria ought tobe taken by France, and that we right ascertain what measures,If any, she might be prepared to recommend.    Failure to dealvigorously with the economic and financial situation might precipitate raest serious political disorganisation not onlyin Austria but in the neighbouring States.The Cabinet agreed(a) That it was not possible to make any furthermonetary contribution to the Govern- -ent ofAustria:(b) That the unexpended portion of the ReliefLoan (about-  1,100,000) already credited to austria should be used to assist in stimu-lating trade with Austria, if possible, bymoans of the insurance scheme which wasunder consideration by the President ofthe Board of Trade:(c) That the Minister of Munitions, in con-sultation with the Treasury, in disposingo^ surplus stores to Central Europe shouldbe authorised to grant long credits,provided doine so did not involve aspecial Vote of Parliament:(d) That the 800,000 barrels ef pickled herrings,which had been purchased by th. . Governmentand were now in the hands of the English and scottish Fishery Departments, should be declared surplus and transferred to thoDisposals Board&apos; for export to the courmtries of Central &apos;rurope so far as was found practicable.
AFRICANthe Cabinet had before them the fellow!(5) rVith referenoe t* Cabinet 59 (2(20), Conclusionrig documents in regardto our AmericanDebt;A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer, covering a Memorandum byMr Biackett (Taper CP.-1259),Memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Papers CP,-2214 &amp; 2214-A),A Telogram from Sir Auckland Gedde3(Foreign Office telegram No.835, datedDece her 15, 1920) .The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat the United States of America had   the right to insist or:the conversion of our eight debt into a lone debt. sineeey?ry certificate bore on it a statement to the effect thatthis would he done on the lemand ef the United States Treasury.They had made such demands, and up to the present we had notcomplied.    &apos;:e had, therefore, failed to fulfil our obliga-tions.    There was reason to believe that the present adrainis-tration would, in all probability, make some demand upon us.This was confirmed by a tele.gram Just received from theBritish Ambassador in Washington, which was read to themeeting.    It&apos; had- at onte time been hoped that the new Bepubli-can Administration might treat us more favourably, but theabove telegram did not support this view.    It was not pro-bable that the United States of America would demand thewhole debt, ;&quot;hich was not a possibility for us to pay.    Infact. It was not anticipated that a refusal of such a demand would permanently damage our credit.    The United States ofAmerica urstee more likely to demand the funding of the debt and the payment of back Interest, amounting at present toabout  BO,000,000.    This, though highly inconvenient andcalculated to depress our credit, was not beyond our powers.The suggestion was made that, in the event of such ademand, we should at once pass on to France our demand,couched in identical terras,  for an equivalent payment, or at least -for a proportionate payment of their debt to us, which would bring home to the general public in the United States ofAmerica that the&quot; debt was net solely a question between :America and. Great Britain, I
Strong views w^ra.expressed ^ureg-ard to the unusual      ^ icharacter       this demand on. us from a nation -which,load.^arirjb----oipated in the general advantage of the victory derived bythe Allies--from the credits given by us, and yet was building a fleet which placed our whole naval position in jeopardy.It was suggested that once we had admitted the principle ofou::.. obligation to pay, we would for Jh:   future be at theirmercy whenever they chose to make a further demand.    It wouldbe better to adopt the line that this debt, owing to the pecu-liar circurstanees in which it had been incurred, had no rela-tion to an ordinary commercial debt.    Our best course, there-fore, would be to refuse to meet the Am rican demand., ine of our difficulties in adopting the course proposedabov0 was pointed out to be that the Prench certificates fortheir debt to us did not bear on them the undertaking of con-version which was carried by the certificates of our debt to tie United States of America,Lord Inverforth, who had just returned from the UnitedStates       America, expressed the view that it was out of thequestion for us to think of defaulting on our debt.    He ad-vised that the debt should be funded, which,he thought,wouldhave a stabilising effect on the financial situation.    his views were strongly supported by Sir Alfred eond,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave theCabinet evidence which,indicated that the attitude of the new government was likely to be less rather than more favourable to us than that of the present administration.    There was,therefore, no reason for delaying coming to terns.While the general view was that the demand was aselfish act, insomuch as the debt hadbeen incurred for reasons fro-  which the United States ofAmerica had benefited, and that it would almost inevitablyrecoil upon themselves and result in a restriction of their      [;trade, the Cabinet felt that it was out of the question
to repudiate our debt, which would be tantamount to filing a petition in bankruptcy.The Cabinet therefore agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for foreign affaire,  in communication with the Chan-oellor of the ^exchequer, should telegraph to the British Ambassador in washington to the offset that an expert was being-sent out at once to -Washington to eon-elude an arrangement:(b) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer should invite Lord Chalmers to conduct the n-egotia-tions, and should give him his instructions,which should include dir otiers to do histest to obtain as lone a respite as possible before the debt was placed on the market.FLINCH (6) Arising out of the previous discussion there wasITALIANg TO US.     considerable discussion as to whether, as a corollary tothe decision to meet the American demands-, we should our-selves make a similar demand on France.It v-;aa pointed out, among other ob^ ntions,  that sucha course would at cnee depress the Continental Exchangesstill further, and render our expert trade more difficultthan ever.It was explained, however, that the suggestion hadbeen made rather as a means of putting pressure on theUnited States cf America than as a proposal, right initseff,  to be put practically in operation.vhe question - as recognised to be one of considerablemagnitude, and it was adjourned for further considerationif any member of the Cabinet should desire to raise it.*
2^qM Hj t&apos;gOPOTMIA, (7) With reference to Cabinet 70 (20), Conclusion 1, tire&amp; Cabinet approved the two attached telegrams, in regard to future policy in Mesopotamia, from the Secretary of Statefor India to the High Commissioner, and from, the Secretaryof State for war to the General Officer Commanding,  respec-tively (Appendices I and II), notifying them that, although no decision had been taken, the general view evinced at theCabinet had been that the expenditure involved in the con-thnued retention of the area of   occupation could not be faced, and that they should prepare plans for a withdrawal to a line co-ering Basra and the Persian oilfields immedi--ately after the withdrawal of our forces from Northern Persia.It was generally agreed that the latter force couldnot be withdrawn before the Spring, even if it were physicallypossible, without bad faith towards Persia.The above decision was taken without prejudice tothe final decision of the Cabinet in regard to Mesopotamia,which would be taken after the officers mentioned above had had an opportunity., if they thought fit, to present more modest proposals.
lllSMPL^YJ^ENTo       (8) with reference to Cabinet^tiationfl   Cabinet had before th--   a draft of a statement v;hm oh -it walib Buildingfade Opera- proposed to place be for the representatives of the Buildingives.Trades Operativeo on December 20, 1920, regarding the absorp-tion of ex-Service roen in house-building operations (paper c.P.-3212)oThe Minister of Labour read to the Cabinet a letter which had h^en received from the Secretary of the building trade Operatives, to the effect that inasmuch as the dele-gates sent to meet the Minister of Labour at the Conferenceon December 20th would not have plenary powers, time wouldbe gained if the Government sent their proposals at theearliest possible moment to tho Executives of the Unions,&quot;The Cabinet wore informed that, as the result offurther enquiries, it had become clear that very littleco-operation on the part of the Local Authorities or of thebuilding contractors eould be counted upon in the event ofthe negotiations of the Government with the Trade Unionsfalling through,,   Friction with the Local Authorities mightlend to sympathetic strikes8 She contractors were making good profits and had abundant contracts in addition to their work on housing.    It was not desirable that the Governmentshould be manoeuvred, into a position of fighting the employ-ers&apos; battles for them, -There iyas some further discussion of the original proposals for a Government guarantee to meet unemploymentabove that of a standard&apos;year.    It was held that if theseproposals were put for-ard and rejected by the men, as theywere likely to be, the Government would be in a much betterfighting position,,.   On the other hand, it was urged that 1&apos;once the Government conceded the -principle of a guaranteethero wouie bw a d--mand &quot;or its extension to oth r trades in which dilution was taking place.-   Further,, if once theoffer were ead-v and if Its&apos; rejection issued In a strike.
it would be open to the men at the end of the strike to fallback on the Government&apos;a offer.A*ter ^nr-th^r discussion the Cabinet ar-r-&apos; - d  (a) That th   draft cironlat d by th-   minister rof Labour should b-   r vis- d, and that itshould contain a d firrit-   und rtaking ontin. part of th&apos;  Gov governments. nt to assist asuppl- rmntary sch n;   in th-- building trad-sprovid d th&apos; mast-rs and men co-op-rat din hearing th   main burden of such sch::&apos;-:&apos;:(b) That th&quot; r vis d draft should b    submittedlet-r in th- day to th-   Prim- minister-r.(9) Th&apos;i Cabin t took not-   of tho following Conclusionsof a Conf r no . of minister -rs, h id on Friday, Dooembmr 10,1920,  at 12-30 p,m.:-(1)  hi-:; Turkish Tr aty.(2) D--control of Bacon,,(?,) Pm-port of Sugar and &apos;,;&apos;-fheatCoirmitit,(Ann appendix III),and in r sard to (5) approved-d th-   proposalmad--- that th&apos;  pending n negotiations for apurchase of 200,000 tons of sugar by th-Sugar Cormrission -as not to b   stay -d but should b    eompl t d in aocordane   withth&apos;. authority giv n by th .

TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY OF STATE TO HIGH COMMISSIONER DAGHDAD, Dated December 17, 1920.

Clear the line.

Private. Your private telegram of ?th December which please show Haldane if you have not done so. The War Office estimates that your proposals will cost about £25,000,000 in the next financial year and that no immediate hope of a speedy financial relief is anticipated. This is apart from any deficit on civil working which I hope will be avoided. In the House of Commons Wednesday no-one suggested the abandonment of our mandate or complete withdrawal from Mesopotamia.

On the other hand the proposal is made by War Office and is under consideration that we should withdraw to Basra with a frontier Ahwaz, Kurna, Nasirieh, or some such line. The suggestion is that in this position one could be secure with a division and that you could hold this without abandoning the mandate over the whole territory already defined including the Mosul vilayet leaving the Arab Government at Baghdad to administer the territory. If you have any observations to offer on this scheme, I should be glad to have them, or alternatively will you try to devise a scheme which would be no more expensive.

SETURKISHTY *S-OONTROLBACON.(1) The attention of the Conference was called to a tele-gram from the Viceroy of India to the Secretary of State,quoting the following telegram published by the &quot;BombayChronicle&quot; ri&quot;Prance and Italy are ureing revision of turkish Treaty and restoration of Thraceand Smyrna to Turkey.    Lord Curzon, whorepresents Drit ish&quot;no no onforalst c one c ience;is opposing frantically and is determined to destroy the Moslem Empire and nation&quot;.The Secretary of State for India reported that, as requested by the Viceroy, ho had, by arrangement with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs., telegraphed a dementiof this mal ibious rumour..(2) With reference to Cabinet 15 (20), Conclusion 1, theConference had under consideration the following documentsrelative to the de-control of imported bacon:-Memorandum by the Pood Controller(Paper CP.-2159).,Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies  (Paper CP.-2250),Memorandum by the Food Controller(Paper CP.-2270)..The Conference were informed that an immediate decisioron the question of the continuance of control mas required todeal with the situation which would arise in the next two orthree months., When large supplies of new bacon would be comininto the market and would compete with the stocks of bacon,valued at about  7,^500,000. held by the Ministry of Food,which had. been bought - at prices higher than those which wouldhave to be paid for the coming supplies.    Immediate de-contrcwould mean that the Ministry of Food would be left with large stocks of stale bacon, which could &quot;only be disposed ofgradually and at an estimated loss of  750,000..    On theOther hand., i/ control was continued, as proposed by theMinister Of Food in Pap-r CP..-2270, until February 28th, itwould be possible to liquidate the old stocks by making anarrangement with the distributing agents.-1-
in C.Pf-.2250With regard to the question raised/by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, the Minister of Pood explained thatthe entire Canadian output had been acquired by the Ministryup to the end of December, 1920, and that as approximately two months rust elapse for Canadian bacon to be cured and toreach this country, his proposal would mean that there wouldbe a free market for Canadian bacon killed as from January 1,1921.Some discussion took place as to the financial effect of postponing de-control, and it transpired that, while theprice of bacon would probably fall in any case during the spring o^ 1921, it was almost certain that in the Summer of1921 the price might rise by an additional 8d. per pound as aresult of the removal of control.It was urged that as the consumer had had the advantages of cheap bacon for a considerable time, the taxpayer should now be considered.The Conference agreed  That the Ministry of Food should forthwithapproach the distributing agents with aview to Leaking am arrangement with the agentson the basis of the earliest possible abolition -tion of control, the cessation of Governmentbuying, and the agents taking over theMinistry&apos;s stocks;   failing a satisfactory arrangement being reached on these lines,the Ministry of Pood to be at liberty tocontinue its control of the importation0^ bacon until February 28i 1921.
(?) With reference to Cabinet 65 (20), Conclusion 8, theConference had under consideration the Final Report of theCabinet Committee (Taper 0.P.-2216) appointed to enquire intothe present position as to sugar and wheat.It was agreed  (a) To approve the recommendations containedin the Report in question   subject to stepsbeing taken to secure that the contemplatedreductions of the selling price of stacksin hand were made as slowly as possible,  andthat in this matter the Wheat and SugarCommissions should lag as long aspossible behind the market:(b) That no immediate reduction should be madein the price of flour.2, Whitehall Gardens, S..1.1,December 10, 1920.
