(1)  With reference, to Cabinet 89  (20), Appendix II, theattention of the- Cabinet was called to&apos; the importance ofexpndr tlhm the provision&apos;of armoured ears for Ireland..The Secretary of State for far undertook to give bis personal attention to thematter and to give the Prime Minister afull Memorandum on the-subject, which wouldshew that good progress was being made.INTELLIGENCE (2) A suggestion was made to the effect that large rewardsshould be offered for information as to&apos;Sinn Pein emissariesand activities in this country.. .Such information was more likely to be forthcoming now than after the Sinn Feiners mighthave established some degree of terror among timid people.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that good results were anticipated from the recent raid on documents in London,    The names of persons already incriminated by a preliminary examination were mentioned, -.(S) With reference to Cabinet 63 (20), Conclusion 5, theHome Secretary stated that-he had received a joint applicationfrom the Chief Constables of Lancashire &apos; Liverpool, Birkenhead.,Wallasey, and rootle, requesting him to take steps to extend the existing prohibition so as to&apos;prevent Archbishop Mannixfrom visiting Liverpool, the Boroughs of Birkenhead, Bootle,Wallasey, and the Hundred of&apos;West Derby.The Cabinet authorised the Home Secretary to take the necessary action to give effect to this request.
(4) With reference to Cabinet 60 (so). Conclusion- 4,the Cabinet had before the.-: a Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade covering a Draft Bill with the objectof safeguarding the Dye-making industry against the serious and rapidly incr-asine -o-vpetition o? german:  (Paper CP.-8191).In the course of a full discussion, the very definitepledges made in the House of Connors on may 15   1018, wereread to the Cabinet.    The Cabinet were reminded that on that&apos;occasion it had been mentioned that the proposals of theGovernment had beer, based on the recommendations of a CabinetCommittee of the previous Government, and that no seriousParliamentary opposition had been offered.Considerable stress was -laid on the importance of protecting the interests of the industries dependent on dyes,,-cn the inferiority of the present British dyes, on theimportance o* pressing on with their technical improvementif they are to bo State aided, and on the difficulty (owingto the smallnesa of the British demand)  in developing a greatdye industry unless the- vast dye market of the Far Bast couldfoe captured.Having regard to the- categorical nature of the pledges given, the importance of the undertakings established on the(strength of these pledges, the considerable measure of agree-government in the proposed Bill both among the dye-rakers and dyeusers, and the iaperftumm- of this indue try from a nationalpoint of view, including that of national defence, whichrsndersd urgent an oarly start in its development, theCabinet agreed  --That the President of the Board of trade should have authority to introduce theDye stuffs (Imports Regulation) Bill inthe House of Commons at an early date.
5) With reference to Cabinet 47 (20), Conclusion 2,the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the minister -.,- of Transport, dealing with Railway Revenue and expenditure(Paper C,P..-2130) ,  .The Memorandum stated -that the recent Coal - Strike--had upset all previous estimates of railway finance, andthat it was now calculated provisionally that the loss cfrevenue due to the Strike and its consequential effectswould be about  6,000,000.    In addition, the disturbedstats of Ireland had adversely affected the revenue to theestimated extent of  2,000,000 for the seven months endingFebruary 38&apos;-, 1*21.    If would therefore be necessary, in orderto produce equilibrium, to find  10,000,000 in the current financial year.    This might be done either by putting up therates of passenger and freight traffic, or by a supplementary estimate,The Cabinet carefully considered these alternatives,and concurred in the vieev of the Ministry of Transport thatit was most undesirable to- dislocate trade by increasingrailway rates so soon after the recent advance, especially as it was very doubtful whether the traffic could bear theadditional burden.The attention of the Cabinet was directed to the extremely unsatisfactory character of the Agreements whichhad been concluded with the Railway Companies in the early days of the Var, and to the Enquiry info these agreements which was now being conducted by Lord Oeivyrg 3 DepartmentalCommittee on Railway Agreements.    A suggest!on. was made thatit might be possible to spread the loss dun to the Strike,and Its repayment, over into the next financial year;   but such an arrangement would involve an extension of - government control beyond the date now fixed for its termination, and.to such extension there were very serious objections.With reference to&apos; the case of Ireland, it was explained that the Agreement with the Irish, Railways was concluded quite separately from that with, the British . .
Railway Companies, and that it would he possible to adopta different policy.    The Government had insisted that therailway servants should carry military traffic, and ontheir fall wave to do so they had been dismissed, with theresult that a number cf the Irirth Railways were not payingtheir working expenses and were gradually coming to a standstill.    The Ministry of Transport were advised that legislation would be necessary to terminate the Government&apos;aguarantee of net receipts to the Irish Railways,    If thatrrvarant^e were removed, it would still be possible for theChief Secretary for Ireland to use the legal- powers hepossessed to control the railways,The Cabinet agreed - (a) That it was undesirable that the lossdue to -the recent Coal Strike and theIrish Railway dislocation should bemet by a Supplementary Estimate for 10,000,000 if it could be avoided,and that the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer and th- Minister of transport should examine whether it were possi-ule to dispense with such provision forthe present, pending the Report of LordColwyn&apos;s Departmental Committee on railway Agreements:(b) That the Minis tar of Transport should- further examine the Irish problem., with-a vi0&quot;-&apos; to devising measures for gettingrid o^ the Government guarantee at theearliest possible opportunity.UNEMPLOYMENT,        (0) The Cabinet agreed  ^o consider the problem of unemployment at a Meeting to be held on Monday after-noon next, December 6, 1980.
