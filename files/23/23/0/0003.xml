(1) With reference to Cabinet 49 (20), Conclusion 3, the-Prime Minister read telegrams dated November 10, 3.920, fromthe Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, communi-cated by the Admiralty, in which it was stated that general wrangel&apos;s forces had evacuated the Perekop position and had fallen back on a second and last defensive line about fivemiles to&apos;the Southward.    If his men were to fight, general wrangel could hold, but otherwise Sevastopol would fall within a week of the line being broken.    The French hadofficially asked to begin at once the evacuation of the civilians, whose number was reported to be 80,000, and tosend tugs &quot;&quot;or tho removal of the Russian ships.    The french admiral had asked for British assistance.The Cabinet agreed --(a) That the British Government should not undertake any action for the evacuation of refugees other than those of british nationality or for the removal of ships under General Wrangel in Black Sea ports.(The Secretary of State for War(Mr Churchill) asked that hisprotest might be recorded apainstthis decision., which, in his view;,might probably result in a ft^pja^e,of-the civilian s &quot;in the. Crimea.) p(b) That the British policy should be that of strict neutrality which should on no ac-count be compromised.(c) that, in the unavoidable absence of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the Secretary should invite his attentionto these decisions, with a view to a communication being made to the FrenchGovernment, if he thinks fit.(The&apos; -first Lord &apos;of ..the ..J^*L?J!Q.&amp;U-^-9-3?3.a not,present at tlaemMeet-lr^:- asked- vdigiQ .aJ.a ncvoaemight&quot;ba aVsoc^-ated -with the Secretary ofr^tate for War&apos;.s. protest.)
(2) The Minister of Transport stated that he was later in the day to meet a number of Chalrmon of RailwayCompanies and he ?rould like the direction of the Cabineton the question of the composition of the DistrictBoards of Managements     The Cabinet&apos; were reminded thatwhen the question of the future of tho Railways wasunder consideration (Cabinet 33 (20) Minute 6) tho cabinet had given their general approval to the proposal to groupthe Railways of the country into five or six large groups8Over each of the groups thero would bfe a Beardof Management and it had been suggested that each board should be composed of 21 members, 12 of whom would represent the Shareholders who would thus be in a majority,.There would be 9 representatives of the employees^ 3 ofwhom would be administrative officers and 6 workmenelected by the workmen from among those employed by theRailways of the groups     Conversations on this basishad taken place with the General Secretary of the NationalUnion of Railwaymen and in the Fhite Paper (Cmd0 787) pre-sented to Parliament the foilcwing Indication of theGovernmentss policy had been made public&quot;Each of the grouped railways will require aBoard of Management, and in order to secureefficiency and uniformity, and avoid undue cost.,the number of members composing the Board should   *be limited to probably 210     The composition ofthe Board Is considered to be of the greatest importance, and whilst in the past the directors of Railway Companies have all been appointed by the shareholders., the Government ere of opinion that thetime has arrived when the workers     both officials and manual workers - should ha/ e some voice in management,&quot;Since the Cabinet decision and the publicationof the White Paper negotiations have proceeded betweenthe Ministry of Transport and the representatives of theRailway Shareholders and Traders, and these negotiations had shown these bodies  to be strongly opposed to theInclusion of representatives of the workmen on the
District Boards.     They were willing that the workmenshould act on Advisory Committees hut that they shouldnot participate directly in management, as it was feared that if this principle were conceded in the case of railways a demand for its extension to other industries would follow.     They were unwilling to admit that anadequate case for differentiation could be made out inthe case of Railways where ordinary free competitiondid not operate.In the course of the discussion It was generally agreed that considerable opposition would be offered in the House of Commons to the adoption of the principleof direct representation of w orkmen on the DistrictBoards, that it would be impossible to deal with thematter in the House this Session, and -that -the applicationof the principle needed further examination.The Cabinet agreed :--(1)   That the Minister of Transport should give no indication of any weakening onthe part of the Government in regardto the principle of the direct repre-sentation of rworkmen on the boards of Management.(2)   That tho matter should be further considered by the Cabinet afterinformation had been obtained bythe Ministry of Labour and theMinistry of Transport in relationto schemes which were being pubforward in France and Italy for givingworkmen a s,haro in the mai^gomont ofi industry.
(3) The Cabinet briefly discussed the position of the: Home Rule Bill, which /as down for Third Reading that afternoon in the House of Cordons.    In view of it beingArmistice Day, it was hoped to avoid, as far as possible,an acrimonious Debate,, and some indication of his willing-ness to do this had been given by Mr Asquith to the PrimeMinister.It was gem-rally agreed  That the Prime Minister,  in his speech,should emphasize the very great lengthsto which His Majesty&apos;s Government had gone in the Bill in the direction of granting effective self-government tothe. Irish people.(4)  The attention of the Cabinet was called to theserious position 6i the British Dye Industry, and particu-larly of the Dyes Corporation, which had been launchedduring the .-ar on the distinct understanding that it wouldbe protected by the Government for ten years by the prohibi-tion of the import of German dyes except under Licence bythe Board of Trade.Owing to a legal decision by Mr Justice Sankey, ithad not been possible to exercise this prohibition, andGerman dyes were coding into this country in large quanti-ties.    The British Dyes Corporation had not yet developed the necessary skill to compete with the German manufacturers,who had the advantage of a favourable Exchange.    In conse-quence of this,, the British Company was in a very serious financial position,, and it was suggested that the DyeIndustry ought to be dealt with separately and at once,,and that the Board of. Trade should be authorised to prohibit the importation of German dyes which compete, directly withthose : ade in this country,, and should only license thosewhich were not as yet produced here.In the course of the discussion it emerged, thatan adequate supply of cheap dyes was of vital importance
in the Textile Printing Trade in Lancashire, and that manydye usera believed that the British Corporation was far frobeing efficiently managed.The President of the Board of Trade said that a subsidy would not meet the case, and the Chancellor of theExchequer expressed his inability to agree to a subsidy.The Cabinet were reminded that very definite pledgeswere given at the last Election, not only in relation tothis industry but to bey industries generally, and thatthese pledges would have to be redeemed.The Cabinet agreed  That, in the first instance, the subject should be examined in detail by theCabinet OoMuittee on Expenditureft who should report to a full meeting of theCabinet,REFORM OP THE       (5) The Cabinet agreed -HOUSE OP LORDS. that the Prime Minister should set upa small CorcmitteePto examine thevarious proposals which had been putforward for the reform of the Houseof Lords.The Secretary was requested to circulate the Report of Lord Bryce&apos;s Committee onthe subject. ^Since the Meeting, the PrimeMinister&quot;has approved of thefo blew being G o rmmi 11 e e: -Lord Curzon (in the Chair),Mr Balfour,Lord Birkenhead,Mr 0 ha mb e r1ai n,Mr Churchill,Mr Fisher,Sir Gordon Hewart.Mr R.B. Howorth (Secretary)
(6) The Cabinet had before them a letter fromthe Admiralty to the --Secretary, Cabinet, covering a Memorandum by the British (Naval, Military ^nH^j\jjcXRepresentatives on the Permanent advisory commission-of the League of Nations, together with aNote by. the Secretary, Cabinet (B.E. u Paper No. 35).The Memorandum pointed out that tho Inter-allied commission of Control will disappear as soon as germany has carried out the Disarmament Clause ofthe Treaty of Versailles,     It will be necessary,however, to mahe provision for carrying out the investigations authorised by Article 213 with theobject ef making sure that Germany does not later onattempt, to evade her obligatiens as regardsDi earmasieffiit *Tho question, therefore, arose as to the natureof the machinery to he provided for the executionof these duties of investigation,The Cabinet approved the proposals putforward by the British (Naval, Military-and Air)Delegation that the Commission of Investigationshould include -(a) A President from among the members of thePermanent Advisory Commission of theLeague of Nat ions.(b) The local attaches and such other membersof the Permanent Advisory Commission asthe Council may direct.(c) Additional.technical members to be ashedfor when required by The Council forsuch Governments as they decide.
