(1)&apos; (a)... With reference to-Cabinet 57 (20), Conclusion 4,the Cabinet r^ero informed, that the [sense of both. Rouses ofParliament had been definitely in favour of nailing as muchaccommodation aa possible, both at the Cenotaph and in theAbbey, available for the-&quot; bereaved relatives of nen-vho had fallen in the-war, and&apos; that Members. of Parliament were willing- to forego the privilege of being present in eitherplace, in the interests of-the bereaved.The Cabinet -^ere agreed that this should not .be held to exclude Members- of -Parliament -iho had thefeiSelveslost sons -or brother? In. the.War,- and .that for these aboutISO pincf*a -should-be retained -In the Choir of the Abbey:    if;his space was not sufficient, the Members should ballpt.-(b)&apos;It - was-explained to. the. Cabinet that the arrangements had-provided for a. procession of-800 men, draxm from theNaval,.Military and Air Forces9 to follow the body of thenameless warrior-from- Victoria Station to ConstitutionalKill,, along, the Mall,, to the - Cenotaph, whence they would proceed to- the Abbey and-be accpEi&amp;odated in the Nave.    Thequestion had&apos;been raised whether these 800 places shouldnot be allocated^ to bereaved relatives, inasmuch as therepresentatives of the fighting forces would have taken a-conspicuous part in the ceremony right up to the entrance to the Abbey,.The Cabinet agreedThat a small proportion only (e.g., 100 ofthe 800) should participate in the &quot;service in the Abbey   this smaller number toinclude representatives of Private soldiers,sailors and airraen..MEMORIAL.

FID(2) With reference to Cabinet 30 (20), Conclusion S, theC:abi;-t Had before the*  the follo-iu-: documents :-A Note by the Chancellor of the exchequer covering correspondenee with      RathbonV &apos;(Paper CP.-1302):$ Note by the Secretary. Ca.bin.nt, cn-^rinp? p&apos;1^&apos;. fro&quot; &apos;3ir and  &apos;:1^-&apos;-,i Mdms (PaperA 3ct-* by tfe Secretary:, Cabinet.  (PaJer0.-2037). V .It was explained that the- subjort aros-.- at this stageon a telegram -fror., His .Majesty&apos; a Ambassador at Washington(No-. 717, dated October 2?, 1Q2C) suggesting that the twoTreasuries should resure the negotiations which had been interrupted in June last, when it hud been agreed that thePrime Minister-should address a communication direct to thePresident of the United States.    To this ccmrcunication, which on Colonel House&apos;a advice,had been   included in a private letter or a general character, no reply had been received.It was clear that in many quarters in the United States theBritish sugg-stion that all Inter-Allied indebtedness shouldbe cancelled was regarded, as a selfish proposal put forward to get rid of a bad debt to us by writing off pur debt to theUnited States, which it was assumed we could pay.    It had further b^r suggested that it would be easier for us to cone-to a satisfactory settlement with the present democratic government than with the new Republican Government.    It wasnot easy to reconcile the campaign utterances of Mr Harding.On the one hand.lie had said that it would be short-sightedpolicy on the part of the- United States to cripple the pur-chasi^f power o^ T^rrope, while - on the other hand he had sug-gested that the British debt to the United States ougt to befunded by ceans o&apos; negotiable bonds which would be sold to-American investors.    By this means the United States would beable to redeem their own obligations and put British bonds inthe hands of American citizens.    It was to this proposal theCabinet had objected in June last.    The American legal posi-tion, as stated by themselves, was that the United States&apos;qpve&apos;rnsaent   /- bad nc
power to postpone the pay, ent of interest by us except aspart of a funding operation.    Under such an agreei ent weshould give the;, negotiable bonds with fixed maturity   andwith a sinking-fund attached- thereto.    The American Govern-uent were anxious not to take the matter to Congress, and itwas to our interest that, they should not do so.    On the dtheihand, \-f nothing wer* done we were liable at any time to be confronted with a demand for interest now due for the past year and a half, and for the accruing interest.    7/e had wait-ed for several months for a reply fro-. President Wilson tothe Prime Minister^ privats letter.    There was no certainty that the President had seen the letter, owing to his ill-health..   It also appeared *rons the telegrams that Sir auckland geddes had not seen the letter.It was generally agreed that the action of the cabinet must largely be determined by an estimate of th-- attitxidelikely to be taken by the Democratic Government before theyquitted office, and by the Republicans on entering office;^her^ was no ground, it was held, for assuming that the republicans would be core harsh towards this country thanthe Democrats.    Mr Harding&apos;s victory was a defeat of the anti-3ritish elements whose support had been sought byGovernor Cox.    On the whole, the Cabinet were inclined tothe view that it was desirable to await developments in thepolitical situation at Washington.Expression was given to the view that we should refuseto enter into a compact to- pay o\m: debt to the United Statesif at the same time the United States contemplated cancellingthe indebtedness of our Allies.It was pointed out that the situation&quot; was complicated-by the f**ct that when the United States car-e into the War they took over certain market obligations of ours, and we hadsurrogated certain collateral securities borrowed by us here.These securities we were bound to return to the owners in Karcl
1922, but the&apos;United States would not release th*m except as part of a funding operation..The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State Cor ForeignAffairs should write a private letter tpSir Auckland Geddes, covering a cop\- ofthe Prime Minister1s letter to President&apos;3;ilson:    that Sir Auckland Geddes shouldbe asked to find out uno rfieially whetherthe President had seen the letter, and what action (if any) had been taken upon it.Sir Auckland Geddes should be informedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government did not wish to raise the natter at the present stage, and that in the view of the Cabinetthy proposal to put negotiable bonds onthe market was very undesirable and would prevent the fulfilment of the hopes ex-pressed in the concluding paragraph ofthe Prime Minister&apos;a letter.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to circulate copies of a communi-cation which ho had recently received from.Sir Auckland Geddos, dealing with the polit-ical outlook in the United States.IE PERSIANSITUATION.THE &quot;BISMARCK&quot;.    (3) The Cabinet agreed  &quot;to postpone th&apos;ft consideration of the caseof the &quot;BISMARCK&quot; until certain informa-tion had been obtained by the ShippingController.(4) The Cabinet considered the present political andmilitary situation in Persia, in the light of recent tele-grams which had been received from the British Representa-tive at Teheran, and by the War Office from General Ironside ,(Foreign Office telegrams Noa. 703, 711, 716, 718).The Cabinet were reminded that vhen the subject was last discussed it was hoped to assemble the Meills and to persuade it to ratify the Anglo-Persian Agreement.    Thishope was bas-&apos;d en the loyalty of the then Persian Prime Min-ist^r, ^lahir^d-Dowleh.    He had failed us and had resignedon account 0* our having insisted on the dismissal of ColonelStaros3el3ki, who had proved a coward and had been discoveredguilty of embezzlement and engaged in secret propaganda against the British.   The p3a ce of Mushir-ed-Dowleh had beentaken by our nominee, Sipahdar.    The Me ills had been summoned,-4-
and although the Assembly was not complete, -the majority ofthe members had been chosen,    Tlie probability now was thatthe new Prime Minister would ask for&apos;.time to prepare theMejlis for the ratification of the Agreement, and in themeantime would ask for further grants of m^ney.On the military side,, the Cabinet were reminded that whereas at the moment the Bolsheviks were engaged in crushingwrangel, once this had been done Bolshevik ;&quot;orees would be released   which could he let loose in Persia and involve our forces there in great danger..   It was now too late, duringthe present winter, -to withdraw our T&quot;orce*    In this connec-tien attention was called to a telegram, which had been s entby the War Office to the General Officer Commanding Mesopo-tatwia, making it clear that the Army Council were not pre-par&apos;--d to endorse any guarantee of the safety of the PersianCapital, and emphasizing that care must be taken to refrain from any commitments that ,-ould present the complete vvith-drawal of Horper Force - should it be considered desirableto adopt such a&apos;course..After reviewing the whole position, the Cabinet agreed(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should communicate to His majesty&apos;^Representative at Teheran the vie&quot;/ of theCabinet that the Mejlis must be summoned,the elections completed, and the Anglo-Persian Agreement submitted to it and pro-,nounced upon before the end of this year;and should state the strong belief of theCabinet that Parliament would not be will-.ing to keep the Norper Force in Persiabeyond rmxt Spring:(b) That, subject to the necessary arrangements with the Persian Government,, the organisa-tipn of the Cossack Brigade should betaken up bv the British military Mission..
JELOUKAEE OP (5) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a QuestionIt-he black sea,which was bein^ put to the Lord Privy Seal in the House ofCommons that afternoon, dealing with the alleged blockade of the Black Sea against Soviet Russia, by the British Navy,and to an Answer prepared by the Foreign Office, which seemedto support the view that there was a definite limitation ofcommercial traffic and not simply a limitation of armsdestined for our enemies1 . a policy which went beyond thatapproved by the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  -That further explanations should beobtained from the Admiralty of thepolicy which was in fact being pursued.IRISH BUTTER (6) The Cabinet had before them the following documentsnoKFROPon tha subject o^ Irish Butter Controla Memorandum by the Food Controller(paper cp,-SO05) :a Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP.-2043).The Cabinet agreed  That the Ministry of Food should exercise their powers of regulating exports of &quot;cumberfrom Ireland, for the purpose of enforcing the agreement made to maintain a reserve of Irish butter for the coming -interat the prices agreed upon.It was also agreed  That a price limit should :. e put uponbutter sold in Ireland.- o-

Hate for MrLjBelt[our^gn^8ignpr (Pittoni1 a Heaoluticmentitled &quot;The League and International Trusts&quot;.le Signor Tittoni invites the Council of the League to placeon the Agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly the qiiestioioJof giving effect to the provision of Article S3 (e) of the Covenantwhich prescribes certain aotion with a view to the equitable treat-ment of the commerce of States mexabers of the Leagues     In doing so he endeavours to commit the Council to expressing a definite opinion in advance, to the effect that the above provision is violated by&quot;monopolies in raw materials essential to the life of all nationa&quot;,and by &quot;the exploitation of nations by great international Capitalisttrusts&quot;o2. It is not of course known why the Italian representativethinks it desirable and opportune to initiate a debate at the first and most critical meeting of the Assembly on two subjects most like-ly to&apos; raise heated coi troversy and to lead to dissensions within theLeague.     But a guess may be hasarded that Signor Tittenl&apos;s object is to raise a discussion on the present Coal export policy of theUnited Kingdom - of which the Italians have frequently complained -and to give satisfaction to Italian oarbour and Socialist opinion.Whatever be the object it would be most unfortunate if theAssemby were to be involved in any such intricate and delicate dis-cussions, for whioh it IS difficult to Imagine any Body less suited.3. As however the provisions of Article 23(e) of the Covenantare invoked by Signor Tittoni to justify the disoussion which he proposes,&apos; it ie necessary to examine how far the Article in questiongives legitimate support to the proposals. The wording of the relevant part of the Article is asfollows&quot;Subject to and in accordance with the provisions ofInternational/
international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon3 H H3K HE italy S3Sthe Members of the League(e)     will make provision to Beoure and maintain freedomof communications and of transit and equitable treatment for the commerce of all members of the League.   In thisconnection the special necessities of the regionsdevastated during the war of 1914 - 1918 shall bo borne in mind&quot;.It will be oeen that the obligation intended by the Article is to conclude International Conventions (so far as the ground is not already covered by existing Conventions) providing for (1) freeoommunioations and transit, and   (2) equitable treatment for theocHimaroe of all members of the League.5. The history of the Article is briefly as followsPresident WilsonPs &quot;third point&quot; provided for the establishmentof equality of trade conditions and the removal of economicbarriers.     In the earlior stages of the Peace Conference hopeswore entertained by some at least of the Delegations that generalCovenants dealing specifically with those two matters might be framed during the Conference and embodied (liko the League ofNations and Labour Covenants) in the Peace Treaties themselves.Ultimately this was found impracticable owing to   (a) the divergencyof interests among the Allies on important points   (b) the short time available, and the urgent need of oompleting the Economicand Communications Sections of the Treaties so far as related to the obligations to be imposed on.the Enemy Countries before taking up tho more thorny questions of tho mutual obligations to be undertaken by the Allies inter jse.,    (o) the volte f aooof the American Delegation which gradually discovered&apos;that theacceptance of such Conventions as part of the Treaties of Peacewould, involve the United States in inconvenient obligations whichhad not boon foreseen when the &quot;Fourteen Points&quot; were drafted.Eventually the course adopted&apos; by general consent was to impose on all States members of the League of Nations the obligations of the Article    quoted above, or in other words to affirm thogeneral/
general principle of such Convontiens, and to postpone their actualjB(ae^ta^.tdx^ paaaa .,flondl.tlon-c should, obtain-;6, A3 regards the first group of subjects, i.e. free oormun-ioations and transit,   vet ion in already being taken by the league in compliance with the Article.     Four draft Conventions have beenprepared for consideration by a special Committee which in factconsisted mainly of the same individuals who formed the Ports,&quot;Waterways and Railways Commission of the Peace Conference, with afew neutral representatives added.     The Assembly of the Leaguewill be invited at its newt meeting to constitute a special conference for the consideration of the e drafts.7. Mo corresponding action has yet been taken with regardto &quot;eruitable treatment of Commerce&quot;, but there have been verysound reasons for the delay, ana on all ground-, it is highly desir-able to carry the Transit and Coramiini cat ions negotiation to afurther stage before embarking on the far more delicate and con-controversial task of attempting to frame an International&apos;commercial treaty.The Transit and Communications Conventions raise fewpoints of hi.gh no1icy or acute controversy.     The auoetions dealtwith by them, though very important, are rather technical thanpolitical, and the main princimlee on which the? are founded are,for the moot part, in, conformity - with the existing practice of themore enlightened nations.     Moreover these cuestions are not onlyripe for treatment, but urgently require immediate action owing tothe transit difficulties arising out of the re-caeting of the mapof the -&quot;orId under the fence Treatie  . .The experience gained i&quot;* preparing and completing this group of Conventions will be invaluable when the far more difficult^task of negotiating Commercial Conventions .i s eventually undertaken.It is clear however that preoont conditions are e:.;tromely.impropitiouo.
unprvpitioun for the immediate starting ^fWwvmr Arrwla.1 ,wg^gyrt-in+AsvnfC,.am^ ^&quot;^he^^ Lec^pie^xr Nat ione-.     The ftcono^&quot; &quot;b\Ate of the world is still entirely abnormal, and until much more substantial progress has been made towards the restoration of normal poaoe conditions it will be very difficult to obtain ahatmosphere in which permanent economic relations can be properlyconsidered in their right perspective, apart from, the distortingeffect of the urgent and special problems of tho transition period,Even in Article 23 of the Covenant a special reservation for thedevastated Countries had to be accented, and any general code for regulating general commercial relations would, as things stand,be certain to be plastered over with reservations and exceptionsof all kinds to meet the present abnormal conditions, which would go far to nullify its value,8. It is therefore the view of the Board of Trade that itIs desirable if possible to delay any steps under Article 23 (e)towards framing an International Convention dealing with commercial relations, until at least another year has elapsed.     The Board ofTrade are also of opinion that whan the moment arrives when thematter can be profitably taken up, the action taken shouldoertainly not be initiated by a debate in the Assembly of theLeague on the merits of particular economic questions of a controversial character, such as would result from the adoptionof Signor Tittoni&apos;s-resolution.     Nor would the reference of thequestion to a Committee of experts constituted ad hoc (the procedure which was. adopted with considerable advantage in the much simplercase of the Transit and ObmmunlbatiCns Conventions) be of any&apos;practical service in the present cose, since the main difficultiesbo be overcome are not technical but political, and can only beprofitably discussed by the responsible ministers of the variousStatics meeting in conference,9f For this reason the Board of Trade take the view that thefirst step towards the desired object which can usefully be takenis the constitution under the auspices of the League of Nations
of a standing Conference of the; Ministers of the various Stakesmembers of the League who are\ responsible for Commerce and Indus-try, with power to send a duly authorised representative in caseof unavoidable absence,i     This Conference would of course be anone efficient organ for the purpose if it wore possible to con^sas.is possible, this Is impracticable, the same object can be attained by the constitution of a small Sub-Committee of theConference to prepare drafts for consideration by the main body.10.     The Board of Trade are further of opinion that the Con-fcreii.ee here suggested would be the most useful form of organ!sa-tion which the League of Nations could set up to consider in thefirst place the other economic problems with which the Leaguehas to deal, eg. the eventual revision of some of the Economicterms of-the Peacti Treaties contemplated under Article (280)of the German Treaty, the annual reports of the various Mandatorieon economic matters within Mandated territories, the mode ofgiving effect to the economic obligations of the various states under Article (16) of the Covenant (Economic blockade of offendingpowers) &amp;c.,&amp;c.11.     The Board of Trade would therefore favour immediate action with a view to the establishment, of such a Conference/with periodic (but not too frequent) meetings, and they would support any proposal for this purpose that may be submitted to thenext meeting of the Assembly, Pgovit-ed^that^^the.....resolution settingup the Conference.......is in entirely general terms, and does not referexplicitly to any of the matters specified in Signor Tittonirsproposal.     It could then be safely left to the Conference itselfto initiate for the consideration of the Supreme Authority of theLeague such proposals for international action as the responsiblefine membership to thc Ministers of the Princlpal^Statcaj, but if,Ministers/
;  nistore of who:n tlio Conference would bo composed considerpracticable and timely.12. Tea sum up: our view as regards procedure is that(a) Siginor Tittoni fs proposal to take immediate action under that port of tho Article 23 (c) of the Covenantwhich refer:] tc the equitable treatment of thoCommerce of Members of the League is premature owingto the unsettled and abnormal economic conditionsstill prevailing,(b)It would serve no useful purpose, and would be extremely undesirable to make the Assembly of theLeague, 6specially at its first meeting, the scene of a debate on controversial Economic cues-tions,(c) It is desirable to move tho Assembly of tho League to constitute a standing Conference of the Pinasterscharged with Trade and Industry (with power incase of unavoidable absence to send a duly authorisedrepresentative) to meet from time to time and toadvise tho League as to the best means of dischargingthe various economic duties which are imposed onthe League of Potions under tho Peace settlement.(d)If such a Conference in constituted the Board ofTrade consider that the British representative should take the line that the time is not yet ripe,for attempting to negotiate an InternationalCa-iBiicrclal Convention.(e)It would naturally be competent for tho Italian re-pro sGntativc on the Conference to put forward prc-posals   for the regulation or prohibition of injury-ious monopolies or international trusts, and of asis suggested above the Conference consists solelyof the competent Pinisters in the various States
advised by their own expert officers any such proposals would be properly explored with s fullsense of responsibility,(f) The Board oi Trade would bt; strongly opposed tothe establishment by the League of Nations of any committee or organisation other than that suggested above, to deal with International Economic questions.13.       Tunning, from the question of procedure to the substance of the questions raised by Signor Tittoni it should not be for-gotten that in the most favourable circumstoricesit would be amatter of extreme difficulty to draft an International commercial agreement to which (say) the United Kingdom, Prance and the UnitedStates, with their widely differing commercial policies would all be prepared to subscribe - (to say nothing of British Dominionssuch as Australia), end which would still possess some element of value.    Yet an agreement which left out any one of these three Countries would practically be of little utility;    Toattempt such a negotiation at s moment when the Unl/oed States isnot even a member of the League, end France is entirely pre-occupied by the difficulties of her recovery from the effects of the war would be to court failure.   At the -^aris Conference,the British Empire Delegation after prolonged discussions werenot able to agree unanimously. among, themselves on the terms ofa Convention to  establish equal trade conditions.    A copy of thedraft prepared by the Economic Section is attached for reference,(mar.ted A), but It was never submitted to the Allies.    probably the chances of general approval of such a draft now are less thanthey were at Paris.14.       Finally, it may be observed that this draft, ,even ifgenerally adopted;   would not have met either of Signor Tittoni&apos;special points, and indeed It seems a straining of the language of the Covenant to regard such matters as the regulation ofmonopolies and trusts .as covered by so general an expressionas the equitable treatment of the commerce of foreign States,unless of course the State itself administers or grants special
powers to such monopolies and trusts and thus becomes res-possible for their actions.15.       The regulation of International Combinations may become a matter which requires the attention of the League of Hations,but it will be a matter of extreme difficulty and complexityand it is futile to discuss it until the various Countries haveteken the preliminary steps to deal with their own domestictrusts.    So far as the United Kingdom is concerned a Bill forthis purpose has recently been drafted, and Is attached(marked B) .    Ithas not how ever i been Introduced^ into^ theBouse of Commons, and is therefore, a confidential draft.The proper course is manifestly for each country to deal withits own Trust problem, so far as is possible- within its ownpowers, alter which, If experience shews that there Is a fieldstill uncovered which can only be covered by international action, the necessary negotiations can be initiated under the auspices of the League of Lstions.   But there should be nomistake as to the difficulty of international action raid thesmti-11 prospect of success without a degree of interference with private enterprise, which most progressive Commercial countries would find Intolerable.16.       The other question mentioned by Signor Tittoni viz:-the existence of monopolies of essential materials is of courseclosely connected with that of trusts and combinations,    itraises however also the question of restriction of export byexport prohibitions or duties contrived so as to retain &quot;hatother Countries may regard as sn undue proportion of output for the needs of the country of production.    It is under this head that the present Coal policy of the United Kingdom may beattached.   As regards the whole question of a policy of con-serve t ion of resources by means of duties or other restrictionson Export,  we cannot fail to understand, and to s considerable extent to sympathise with, the anxiety with which States lessfortunately placed than the British Empire with regard to
essential materials look upon every step which has to them theappearance of an attempt to reserve Imperial resources forBritish use, and to make a^eess to these resources by otherCountries more difficult.   The whole subject Is a thorny one and needs further careful exploration from the point of viewof Imperial Policy, before we could profitably discuss it -with Foreign States.-9

-DISABILITY PENSIONS COMMITTEE.Third Report.1*     The Disability Pensions Committee submit thefollowing&apos; further report dealing withA. Pensions and Allowances of widows, children and dependants of Warrant Officers, Non-Coraaissionnd Officersand men of the Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Marines,and of Petty Officers and men of th** Royal Wavy, whosedeaths accttr after the war and sre not attributable tf,service in the war;   and b. pensions and Allowances of widows, children -nddependants of officers whose deaths occur after the war andare not attributable to service in the war.The Committee hope to present at an early date afinal report dealing with the retired pay of officers whoretire after the war on account of disabilities notattributable to the war, including the subject of woundpensions.A.     Widows., Children and Dependants sf warrant officers, Son-Commissioned Officers and Men, etc.2.     Widows&apos; Pensions.(a)   Entitlement.The Committee are agreed that it is no longer possible to retain the old Army rula limiting pensions to widows formerly on, the married establishment.    They have considered proposals to grant pensions (ga) to all widows,and (b) to those who during the soldier&quot;s life wereeligiblo for separation allowance or marriage allowance.It is understood that all wives will be eligible formarriage allowance when the soldier or sailer has attaineda certain ago (26 in the Army and 25 in the Navy),The Committee have considered whether a similarlimitation should be applied to widows&apos; pension, but anthe whole they are against making this distinction.    the exclusion of any widew would be contrary to the principlesof
of tho Workman11 s CompensAtion Act.   Moreover as theCommittee are recommending certain provision for dependantsand the widow if excluded from a widows&apos; pension must atleast he reckoned as a dependant, the difference in costbetween theproposals is not great.     The Committee therefororecommend (a).The Committee recommend that in general the rules for entitlement should not bo mors favourable than thoseprescribed under the pre-war Warrants, without specificTreasury sanction.    Under pre-war Warrants the widows pensionwas given in cases of death in action, or death from woundsor injuries received in the performance of military duty,and death from disease, contracted or commenced on active service.    The Committee now recommend that there should bea slight extension as regards injuries and a restriction as regards deaths from disease and that pension should begranted in all cases in which it is proved that death is directly attributable to the conditions of service, i.e.,the rule will be the samo as in the ease of disabled men.(Ts)   Rate of Pension.Under the pre-war Warrants the basic rate of widows pension was 5/- a week to which additions were madein respect of rank.     The practice of the war Warrants on theother hand, is to give one half of the maxinnim disabilitypension at the rate appropriate to the rank, to a widow under40 years of age and without children and two-thirds of themaximum disability pension to a widow over 40 years of age crwith children.   The war-rates applied, however, to widows ofmen serving compulsorily under the Military Service Aots, andwere necessarily formulated on more generous lines than thosewhich apply to peaae-time conditions and to purely voluntary service.After careful consideration the Committee havedecided to r icommend a minimum basic rate of 10/G a week.This
This rate Is to apply to a widsw without children and Is tobe subject to inc. ease in respect of dependent children, age or iniiraiity.The Oommlfctae recommend the following scale?-A widow not over 40 yaara of sg*and without childrenA widow ever 40 years of age or with children10/6 a week17/6 &quot;     &quot;A widow over 60 years of ago 20/- &quot;     &quot;The Co.TjaiHe6 recommend in addition the grant toa widovi, under 40 years of ago and without children, of apension at tho higher rats 17/64* s week) in caseswhere thsre is satisfactory medical evi&amp;anoa that she is unable to earn0(0 ^   Rank Additions.The Committee propose ths following weekly additions to be made to the widows! pension In respect of ths rank ofthe deceased soldidrtArmy Hank-Navy Hank.Air PorefianktWo eklyAddition,Warrant Officer(Glass I)Warrant OfficerClass II andKoCC, Class I(for pension)Marine warrant officer Class IINidiOftGlasB IIH.C.-.0-.

But widows of&quot;Warrant Officers Class I will be treated, as heretofore,as officers&apos;-widows.In view of the pressure now being raised by ex-service organisations for resumption of pension in case of need, the Ministry of Pensions would prefer the adoption inthe oaso of men of the rule now applicable to officers&quot;widows, vie. no gratuity on remarriage but resumption ofpension on second widowhood, in case of need.3.     Children^ Allowances&apos;The Committee recommend an addition to the widow1ss.pension of an allowance of 5./.- u week for each child.   Th$conditions of award to be generally those prescribed in thepre-war regulations, subject to the adoption of the maximumage of 16 in all casos for purposes of award and with the samerules as to exceptional continuance beyond that ago as in the warrant of the 5th December 1919.4.     Motherless Children.The Committee recommend a pension of 10s. a week for aach motherless child of a sailor, soldier or airman,whcsa widow, had she been alive, would have been eligible fora pension under the recommendations of the Committee.5.     Other Dependants.No provision was made in the pre-war warrantsfor the grant of any compensation to the dependants, otherthan widows and children, of sailors and soldiers whosedoaths were attributable te: service, apart from certaingratuities in the oase of the Navy.   The War Warrants domake such provision.
Conaiderahle diversity cf opinion existb.an&amp;ng-the representatives of the different departments on thoquestions whether any such provision should he made in thepost-war warrants, and if st,, to what extant and on what conditions.    The views of the majority of the Committee!may bo summarised, -(a) there should he provision for dependants;(b) need, relationship, proof of dependence should all be necessary conditions to any grant;fc)   where any grant is made under paragraphs 2 to4 above to a widow, and/or a child or ohildren,any claim of ether dependants of the sameman must bo regarded as barred;(d)    the total provision for dependants must in no case oxoeod 10s. a week save in the special case referred to in par a,graph 6 (b) below inwhich case the limit is 12s.6d.Proof cf dopendence means proof of dependence at timeof doath.    The Ministry of pensions disagrees with the limita-tion of proof of dependence to dependence at the timo of death;the main reason for the grant of pension being that of need,actual dependence at the date of death should net bo insisted on, if the circumstances of the family have so changed since then,  (e.g. by the death of the breadwinner) that it Isprobable that the soldier, had he lived, would then have contributed to the support of the family.6.     The only dependants who should be recognised areparents and brothers and sisters.Parents.fa)    If the man died in ciroumstanoes such that had he left a widow she would have received an attributable pension,his parent or parents may be granted a pension of 7s,6d. aweek (10a. if there are t..* parents) provided that,(1) they are in pecuniary need,  (2) they were largely dependent/
6-dependent on the man, and (3) the man did not leave a widow or child.(b) On the parents,  or one of the parents, attaining the a;?c of *0,  or if one of them is seriously incapacitatedby ill health, the pension may be increased by 2/6 per week.Brothers and Sisters.(c) If the man died in circumstances such that, haihe left a widow, she mould have received an attributablepension, his brothers or sisters under 1? years of age maysbe granted subject to the collective limit cf 10/-, allowances as if they were the children of the soldier, provided that(i) they ars in pecuniary need,  (2) they were largely dependenton the man, and  (&apos;6) the man did not leave a widow, child    -or pensionable parentiThe allowance may be continued, over the age of16 in the same circumstances as in the case of children.7 *     Warrant Officers, Class I (Army ^ and,,. Air , go roe).The Committee recommendthat ordinary-widow&apos;s pension and children&apos;s allowance should remain payable under the conditions of Article723 of the lay Warrant of 1914 but the rates will bealteredfrom  20 to  30 per annum for the widow andfrom  5 to  10 per annum for each chili.
B.   Widows, Children and Dependant, of Off leer a.8.     Under the pre-war warrants there were threedifferent scales of pension, for officers&apos; widows:- viz.ordinary, intermediate and highest.       Where the highestscale was allowed (officer killed in actien or died cfwounds received in action within 7 years of having beenwounded) a gratuity was also paid ranging from  100 to the widow of a second lieutenant to  3,500 to the widow of aField Marshal.      A further complication has resulted from the fact that during the war pensions on the highest(in lieu of the intermediate) scale but without gratuityhave been paid to widows of officers whs die from illnessdirectly traceable ts fatigue privation or exposure or inconsequence of injuries received in the performance ofmilitary duty other than death in action or from woundsreceived in action.       There are thus at the present timefour different types of awards.       As the Hoyal Warrantof 2nd July 1920 distinguishes in the case of the highestand intermediate pensions, between widows with childrenor over 40 and widows without children and under 40, thereare in effect seven different scales-The Committee are decidedly of opinion that itf&quot;is undesirable to continue so complex a scheme asa &quot;permanent arrangements       They do not consider that in postwar conditions there is sufficient reason, in the case cfofficers&apos; widows, for distinguishing between widows with children or over 40 and widows without children and under 40.Moreover the existing war scheme Is difficult to administerand involves ondlesa disputes and appeals.       The Committeeare in favour of merging the highest and intermediatescales of pensions in attributable cases.If &apos;
If thoy had a free hand in the matter, the committee would not recommend the continuance of the systemof granting gratuities in addition to pension to widowsin the special case of officers killed in action.In the actual circumstanoos they arc, however, unable torecommend that these gratuities should be abolished.Apart from the opposition which would be raised en. grounds of tradition and sentiment, the Committee have to face the position that, if the gratuities &quot;wero abolished, itwould almost certainly bs necessary to increase theattributable seal a cf pensiciis, as compensation, probablytc a degree which would raise them too much above thointermediate rates for the great war.       But while thoyconsider that&apos;tha gratuities should remain, the Committeewould limit them in future, if possiblo, to cases of deathin action and from wounds received in action.       certain questions arising on this will require further detailed consideration by the Departments concerned, for example the Committee think that the Treasury and the Air ministry should consider whether it is any longer necessary toinclude in those cases In which gratuity iS-J&amp;flid the caseof a widow of an officer who is killed or dies of injurysustained on flying duty or while being carried cn duty in aircraft under proper authority.The amount of the gratuities up to the rank ofColonel inclusive should remain approximately as at present,but the - o^trcmeij Doigh rates for widows of General officers are susceptible of some modification.Assuming
Assuming the retention of gratuities on these terms, the Committee have considered what scale would be appropriate as an 1 attributable &apos; scale&apos; , and have decidedto reeommend that the highest&apos; Scale in Article 654of the Pay Warrant be adopted, with the modification of raising the Subaltern&apos;s widow from  80 uO  &apos;J0 and gradingthe Generals&apos; Widows. This plan will secure an advano cin rates t^those widows who would formerly have received an interned!ate pension or less, while ensuring in general thatthosewho would have been eligible for the highest, receive notlass pension than under existing pro-war regulatisns.One difficulty, however, has had to be considered.The proposed rates 10r widows of Ool*.nel, Lieutenant Colonel,Major and Captain are slightly higher than those in the great war intermediate scale for widows under 40 and withoutdepeniUftt children.     The Committee consider it very undesirable to revise the ^reat War rates again, and theythink the difference can be justified on the following-grounds - (l)    the new rato is to include highest cases aswell as intermediate, and to apply to widows over 40 an;&apos;,with children as well as to those undej     - and without children; (8) the Great War widows on reaching the ago of 40will attain rates in excess of those now proposed for post-war oases;    (o) many of the Great VLr widows of ^gularOfficers are eligible for alternative pensions higher thaneither of the flat rate scales in question;    (4) the proposedscale will apply to strictly attributable cases only, whereastha Creat War scale Is applicable also to casos of aggravation.Should it provo, contrary to the expectation ofthe Committee, that th is position cannot be defended inpractice, and should the war rates of the few widowsconcerned ba raised to level of the proposed post warattributable
attributable rates, the Committee are advised by theMinistry ef Pensions that the cost will be, allowing for the fact that at least half the war widows will be &apos;eligible for Alternative Pension,  1,500 per annum.9.     The Committee -therefore recommend the followingclassification:-(l)    Ordinary peusior.:   non attributable death, Includingcases of retired officers,fii)   Attributable pension: death due to wounds,injuries, or disease directlyattributable the conditions ofservice.(ill)   Attributable pension:   hilled in action or dies ofplus gratuity,; ?-. v &apos; - woimds reoaived in jotioa.In all cases the present rule as to death withinseven years of the casualty as a condition to an  Wt.rd willbo maintained *10.

HE G( ?ERN&amp;HlT With reference to Cabinet 37 (20), Appendix &quot;I (3)P IRELAND^LL,(t the Conference discussed the desirability of making certainamendment3 in the Government of Ireland Dill as regardsfinance.    The suggestion was that both the Northern and southern Parliaments should receive complete financialautonomy, and that the contribution to Imperial services in its p-esent form should be dropped, and, instead, that each portion of Ireland should assume liability for a defi-nite portion of the National Debt and should be left tocontribute voluntarily to all other Imperial expenditurewhatever1 sum its Parliament might thin]&apos;, fit.In support of this proposal it was stated that therewas a great advantage in pursuing this course and cf putting forward a financial scheme which would be accepted by thetwo Irish Parliaments.   The Bill as it stood at presefapjiti**  .though not ungenerous, could be made more liberal as regardsfinance.    A further defect of the present Pill was thaMimv.^-&apos;there was too much British intervention in Irish affairavand the collection fcy English officials o&apos;f Customs, E&amp;dlseand Income Tax. would act as an irritant.    It was centeredthat the Government should have the courage of its convic-tlons, and say that this new solution was put forward inthe belief that it would settle the question, that nofurther concession could possibly be made, and that the giving of complete financial autonomy to both Parliamentswas the Government&apos;s limit in the way of concession.Further^ this plan would have the support of, and would strengthen, all moderate opinion in Ireland.   An additionalargument put forward in support cf the new- scheme was thatthe Government was in need of all the strength and backingit could obtain from public opinion in breaking up the murder gang, and doubt was expressed whether such support would be forthcoming if it was considered that the Governmenthad not gone far enough in the way of financial concession.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it would be a mistake at this stage to make any great concessions, eapeci-ally when the prospects- of getting anything in return were so small.   Nothing would be left with which to negotiate ifthe Irish adopted a conciliatory attitude.    The giving of customs, Excise and Income Tax meant a great deal, and ifthis were done Ireland could not remain an integral part ofthe United Kingdom.    The scheme put forward was not compatible with her so remaining.    She could either support us or not,as she chose.    The test to apply was whether you could give to other parts of the United Kingdom that which you were giving to Ireland, and it was obvious that it, would be impos-sible to do so.    The retention of Customs was always regardedas a sign of unity.    Take the cases where there were otherFederal, systems   Germany and the United States of America.Bavaria was independent, had a separate King and a separatearmy;    but they had not- got Customs.    It was, in fact, thefirst thing they gave up as a symbol of unity to the german empire.    The United States did not give Customs and Excise toits Federal States.   At one time the States had had thelevying of Income Tax, and one of the greatest politicalstruggles in the United States had been with the object ofobtaining Federal control of Income Tax, which had been foundabsolutely essential in order to raise money for defence.We, who had control of Income Tax, were now talking of givingit up.    That would be to let Ireland off financially.    Thatwas not the Home Rule on which he had been, brought up.  M-f.Customs had to be conceded in order to obtain peace, it mightbe considered;   but he would only consider it if it wasimpossible to get other terms.    Sinn Fein would have to come forward and bargain.    But the Government had already saidthat they were prepared to cone to an agreement.    By giving up Customs, Excise and Income Tax we should get nothing inreturn from. Sinn Fein.    By giving up these three things we
delivered the key of the whole position to Sinn Fein;   theywould collect the taxes and would refuse to pay their contri-bution to the Imperial exchequer.   What should we do then?Try and get Customs, Excise and Income Tax back again?    once the machinery -for collecting these taxes had been handed overit would be impossible to get it back.Continuing, TBJ- PRIMS MINISTER said that he was all forjustice for Ireland, but at the earn---- time it. must be remem-bered that justice was due to England, Scotland and Wales,who had made greater sacrifices in the War than Ireland-.This country would have to bear the extra burden of thefinancial concessions proposed, and there would be in Irelandcheap whiskey, cheap tobacco   everything cheap;    and herepeople would be staggering under their burdens.    Such a stateof affairs would be intolerable and unjustifiable.    Anotherreason was that Sinn ?ein would, not accept such concessions,for it w?a abundantly clear that they meant to have complete independence, and would not take anything less.   We had got agreat inheritance, and in a moment of despair must not barterit away in order to get &quot;Peace In our time, 0 lord&quot;!    Ke waslooking forward to using Customs, Excise and Income Tax as a means of reducing Ireland.    Ulster meant to work this Bill.As for the South, she would use it and the proposed conces-aions to extort some-thing -further.   If we retained thesetax/---s the Sinn Feiners were at our mercy,   He had asked Sirlaming Worthihgton Pvans&apos; some time ago to work out how muchof the revenue of Ireland would remain in our hards if weheld only the ports, and he had worked it out at something like three-quarters.    He himself was in favour of holdingthe ports until a guarantee of some kind was forthcoming.To the counties in the South which declared a Republic hewould say:    &quot;You must pay your Old Age Pensions, Insurances,&apos;etc., etc.&quot;   Such a course was not without precedent.   the roman Empire had constantly to do this kind of thing in -Sicily.   If we gave up Customs, Excise and Ircoue Tax without
getting anything in return, it would be the worst piece ofbusiness which this Government had *ver done, and he couldnot face the position.    Such taxes ought to be Imperial taxes,and it was unsound in principle to part with these things.lie was still a Gladstonian Home Ruler, and wished to keepIreland as an integral part cf the United Kingdom, and thatwas why he hoped that the present Bill would be proceeded with,    mhe Bill was a good and generous one, and under itit would be possible to keep the United Kingdom, which was asmall country, together in sore sort of unity and enable itto face the future;.   He would stand by the Bill until some-one with real authority in Ireland appeared with whom it waspossible to negotiate.THP F&apos;IMF MINISTER added that he would like the Farlla-mentary Draughtsman to consider to what extent under the Billit was possible for the Imperial Government to retain controlof certain parts of Southern Ireland, whilst leaving the SinnFein Parliament to govern the rest, and also to what extent it was possible to. govern the retained areas as we chose.mp.pi Centre nee avreed  -That no change of principle should be madein tho Financial Clauses of the Governmentof Ireland Bill.Whitehall Gardens, S.S.1,October 13, 19SC.

The Bill itselfhad provided that the Joint.Exchequer Board should review it after tho end of two years.In o^der to meet this criticism, it was agreed,subject to the consent of the Chancellor of theExchequer(a) That the Joint Exchequer Board, when considering anat the ^-rish contributionto Imperial Expenditure is to be afterthe first two.years, should also beempowered to review tho figure of18 millions now estimated as the fairIrish contribution towards Imperial .expenditure and shoud ascertain whetherit had in practice proved to be just.If the amount of the. contribution was found..to be too large, the excessshould, be returned to the Governmentsconcerned.(b) That a Clause to this effect should boinserted in the .oill.
The provision   (4).     It was pointed out that the Northern Parlia-of ParliamentHouses and        ment would ho under a great disadvantage as comparedGovernmentOffices. with the Southern Parliament insomuch as within thearea of its jurisdiction there were no suitablebuildings available for use as Government Offices.In Dublin Government Offices already existed, but a parliament House would have to be found for theSouthern Parliament,Subject to the consent of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, it was agreedThat a deduction should be made fromthe Irish contribution of 18 millionstowards the Imperial expenditure in thefirst two years in order to provide such sums as the Joint Exchequer Board may deem necessary for the provision of Parliamentbuildings and Government Offices for theIrish Parliaments and Executives,(5).    It was generally agreed that the aboveprovisions would give effect to the Chief Secretary&apos;astatement in his speech on October 13 at Belfast, tothe effect that the Government were prepared to enlarge the whole Bill in tho most generous way possible to make complete and final settlement of the Irish question.SIS L. v-ORTHIiIGTOH EVAN3 undertook to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel    jlth a view to the drafting of the Clauses to carry out the aboveoinclusions.nO   c  *   *   9 toWhitehall Gardens, S.W.1.17th October, 1920c

MftklftTBa-^ (1) With reTex^mw**to^UkMjiet  8^tl^^^fVrprce had before them the following documents   &apos;relating to the present position of Mandates:-A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, covering Revised drafts of Mandates (Paper CP.-1896):-A Letter fron  the Foreign Office to theSecretary to the Cabinet (Paper L.N.C.-6):A Letter from the Foreign Office to theSecretary to the Cabinet (Paper L.H.C.-7):A Letter from the President of the Councilof the League of Nations to the PrimeMinister (Paper L.N.C.-S):A Draft &quot;One-Clause&apos;: Mandate (Paper L.N.C-10).A&quot; Mandates.. The Conference were informed that it was most desir-able that the British Mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine,and  the French Mandate for Syria, should be in substantiallyIdentical terms.    The Mesopotamian Mandate had been&apos;held upfor Sir Percy Cox&apos;s views, which had just been received, and-from which it appeared.that Sir Percy Cox generally favoured the Revised Draft and thought that its publication would serve a useful purpose.    It was now proposed to submit the threeMandates in question at the earliest possible date to theCouncil of thr- League of Nations direct.    This course wouldprobably avoid difficulties which Japan might raise if, ashad been originally indended, the Mandates were submitted tothe Allied Powers for approval before being brought beforethe League.Attention v*aa drawn to the somewhat rigid character 1of the Revised Draft Mandates (Paper CP.-1896) and to thefact that they imposed duties and obligations on theMandatoryof a nature which might unduly fetter liberty of action andprove unworkable in practice.    In particular, it was pointedout that it would not be open to Gxeat Britain to raise Arabtroops for the general defence of the Empire, even if theArabs were willin- to fight outside Mesopotamia.     It wasalso thought very desirable that Great Britain should retain the right to p^^mmd a claim to be reimbursed her heavy

In these c jroomubao-oosit was suggested that it might ho preferable to submit to theI segue a provisional Mandate in &quot;vo-guo and general terms,such as the &quot;Ono-Clcruso&quot; Draft of L.U.C. 10, which night bosuperseded by a more elaborate document when experience had shown tho extent to which it wa s   necessary or desirable tortho Mandatory to try to restrict her liberty of action ino or tain definite directions.On the other hand, it was pointed out that thoLeague and public opinion had boon awaiting formal documentsfor a long time.       Tho Council of tho League would not accept a Ono-Clauss Mandate, and as the Government was&quot;pledged In any case to an elaborate document in tho caso ofPalestine it would bo most difficult to defend r. totally different typo of document for Syria and Mescpctamiai       Thomilitary and trading provisions ox the He3opotamion I-Jfcndatohad boon drafted with particular reference to. the Syrian!:Iandato, which should bo in identical terns*It was generally felt that tho Syrian Mandate wouldprobably in any case be interpreted by the French to moottheir own requirements $ end that it was desirable to insertwords enabling tho Mandatory, wit   tho consent of tho LocalGovernment, to employ local troops raised in Mesopotamia and palestine for purposes other than the maintenance of order and the defence of tho respective territories^ &apos;In the course of further.discuss ion, the Conference -woro informed that the latest reports about Mesopotamia^ oilwere not encouraging, and It was generally agrerod that&apos;thoonly hopo of recovering some part of our heavy expenditure would be in tho event of tho oil fields being successfullyosploitod.        It was probably out of tho question, howovor,to look for recoupment of purely military expenditure priorto tho armistice.
(a) To approve the Draft Revised. Mandatesfor Palestine and lAeso^p-o-t^amia (FacerC.P.-1G96) subject to modification inthe following particularst-(i) The insertion, in the appropriateArticles of the Mandates for Meso-potamia and Palestine, of provisionsenabling the Mandatory, with theconsent of the Local Government,  to employ local forces otherwise than for the maintenance of order and thedefence of the mandated territories:. (ii) The addition to Clause 14 of theMesopotamian Mandate, and Clause20 of the Palestine Mandate, of aprovision enabling Great britain to claim to be reimbursed for herexpenditure in maintaining law an*iorder since the Armistice, and also.the value *f railway, irrigation andother plant handed over to the Meso-potamian and Palestine Governmentsrespectively.(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign .Affairs should inform the French Govern-ment of the modifications which the cabinet had decided to introduce into the Mesopota-mian and Palestinian Mandates, with a view*j similar amendments being introduced intethe Syrian Mandate:(c) That in the event of the French Governmentagreeing; to these modifications, the       . /Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should communicate with Mr Balfour, in brussels, so that in collaboration with&apos; M, Bourgeois the three Mandates in ques--   tion might be laid before the Council of*he League on an early date.2*or tho reasons subsequently stated la CP.2013the Secretary of State for -India tissoatod from tho aboveconclusion giving general approval to the revised draft
rne^O*m arence took note that the Ms&quot; and^bT MandaTeir -had been allocated as follows:-German Fa3t Africa.....^-^--^-^^^Gr^arlr&apos;!^West Africa (Togoland andOameroons) Great Britain-and Prance,German South-Yvest Africa .........Union of South Africa.German Possessions in PacificSouth of the Equator (exceptSamoa and Nauru)  .................Commonwealth ofAustralia.Nauru............................British Empire.S am o a............................New Z e a land, &apos;German Islands North ofthe Eciuatt^r ......................

These bound-?,ries have been settled in agreansnt with the Belgian andFrench Governments respectively.The Conference agree a -*-That the facts as to the allocation of&quot;B* and &quot;C&quot; Mandates should be communi-communicated to the League of Nations,  togetherwith the information &quot;hat these territories^are being actually administered by theMandatory Powers pending the definitesettlement of the terms of the Mandates,
C0NSTTTUTI9N        (g) The Conference had before them a Memorandu-  bv theCP PERMANENT &apos;COMMISSION or^?.^T*ets.ry of State far the Colonies (Pacer L.N.0.-9) &quot;relativeCONTROL UI\TaLT\.ARTICLE 22 0? to the proposals of the Secretary-General of the Leasue ofTHE COVENANT. &apos; a &apos;Nations for a Permanent Commission of Control under Article-22, para. 0of.. the Covenant.It was pointed cut that this paragraph provides fcr aPermanent commissioners si an t: receive and examine the annual reports of the Mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the Mandates.    Thedraft scheme drawn up by the Secretary-General provides fora Commission of Control of 15 members, 7 of whom will represent-sent the Mandataries and 0, who will be nominated by etherGovernments and eh sen by the Assembly, will not.The Conference were informed that the Dominions had as yet had nc opportunity-of considering the proposals,- towhich they might object, not only because of the Mandatories&apos;minority representation, but because the view might be taken that the. pro posed-,-Ocirimiss ion of Control goos altogether beywiAthe scope and purpose of Article 22 of the Covenant.The Conference agreed  That the Council of the League should beinformed that His Majesty&apos;s Government wasnot in a position to accept the proposals contained in the draft scheme for the organ-isation of the Commission of Control untilthe Dominions had had full opportunity of considering those pro poo ale- and statingtheir views upon them.
FUTUR   STATUS (3)    The Conference had. before the   a Note by theOP ARMENIA.Secretary to the Cabinet (Paper C.p .-1-92B)  covering a copyof a letter from the Secretary-General to the League ofNations, transmittinr a resolution respecting- cting the future status of Armenia, which had been adopted by the Council ofthe League, and also a Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP.-3970) drawing attention to  the decisionof the Supreme Council at San Remo on April 36, 1930, thatthe Allied Powers were unable to assist Armenia otherwise than by the despatch      arm? and munitions, and stating thathe was strongly opposed to committing Great Britain to participation in an international guarantee of any Loan,whether for Armenia or for any other of the countries whichwould at once be encouraged to make similar demands.It   -as agreed  That Great Britain should not of for toparticipate in any financial guarantee to be given to Armenia by the membersof the League of Nations, and thatobjection should be taken to any such proposal being submitted by the Councilto the -Assembly of the League.
PERMANENTOOU^-T CF IN-TFRNATICNALJUSTICC(4) With reference to Cabinet 5? (20), Conclusion 11, theConference had before ther the following documents relatinnto the draft scheme for the institution of a permanent Courtof International Justice, proposed by a Commission set up bythe League of Nations,  to be considered this week by theCouncil of the League, as provided for in Article 14 of theCovenant:-A Note by the Secretary to the Cabinet,covering a copy of a letter from the&quot;Act-in? Secretary-General of the Leagueof Nations (Paper 0,P.-1039):A Note by the Secretary to the Cabinet,covering a copy of a letter fro-.!, theForeign Office (Paper CP.-1902):A Memorandum by the Attorney-General(Paper CP.-1905):A Memorandum by the Lord I resident of theCouncil (Paper C.P.-1986):A Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor andthe Law Officers (Paper CP.-1962):A Memorandum by the Secretary-Generalof the League of Nations  (Paper CP.-1974).The following objections were urged against the draft a cheme:-(i) The scheme is compulsory:    that is to say, itjroes %r beyond Article 14 of the Covenant,which, only contemplates a scheme for a 6&apos;otirtto hear disputes which the parties theretomay voluntarily submit to its jurisdiction.(ii) The scheme is detrimental to us as a Sea Power,since it would enable predominantly Land Powersto build, up a Code of international Law which&apos; would fetter the exercise of our seapower.     Unless precautions were taken toprevent its application being made ret.ro-speetiv-&apos;&apos;, it would even enable appeal to bemad&quot; against th - decision of our Prise courts in the late War.(iii) Even if it was generally recognised that decisions of the Court in particular easesdid not constitute future precedents,  the factthat the Court had giver-, a decision might seriously hamper Great Britain in a futurewar and strengthen the position o;&apos; neutralStates against her.There was general agreement .that the scheme, asit stood,was highly detrimental to,pur national interests
and could not be accepted, and the question resolved itselfinto one of procedure.   The following arguments vere advanced(1)  The British Government had never undertaken to-accept any particular scheme, and could not be bound by the action of the British represent-tive or. the Drafting Committee, who had been selected,not by the British Government, but bythe League, of Nations.(2) The British Government was entitled to have timeto discuss the question with the Dominions.In this connection, however, it was pointed outthat there had been ample time for such consult-ation, and that to use this particular argument,having regard to the fact that the Empire hadsix. votes in the Assembly, was not politic.(S) The United States of America are still outsidethe League, and consequently outside the scheme.There was,  therefore, a risk that one Code ofInternational Law might grow up or one side ofthe Atlantic and another Code on the other.This would vitiate the whole scheme ab initlo.It was then pointed out that, since, sooner or laterGreat Britain would have to define her attitude towards thewhole question, it might be best to state bluntly that, as a nation entirely depend-mt on sea power, we reserved full discretion regarding the submission of maritime questions to the jurisdiction of an International Court.    The decisions ofthat Court might go far to destroy the offensive value of theBritish Fleet.    The Blockade was the most tremendous weaponever forged, and to&apos; a certain extent it involved the denial of justice to Neutrals.   Even if Great Britain could not be forced into an arbitration, it was clear that our positionwould be prejudicially affected if, as was likely, we were forced hereafter into action which was notoriously in defiance of decisions cou to by the International Court.T*he Conference were reminded that the Anglo-Saxon mindhad more regard to the value of precedents than the Continent-al mind, and that the distinguished persons who. framed thescheme had no practical experience of the difficulties which arose out of legal disputes between States.    It was suggestedthat the whole scheme should be referred back to the drafting committee to exolcre the practical difficulties, and that the
best solution might be found in having an international court sitting in Chambers, with special expert Judges ad hocdealing with different matters, such as maritime business,1 ehour d? soutns    etc.In this connection the Conference were reminded ofthe danger which might arise through the League of Nationspropounding plans which no individual Government would beprepared to endorse.    The League of Nations Secretariatshould be a Post Office between the League and the various governments, and should not of its own accord initiate action.Otherwise the Governments might find that they were notmasters in their own houses.The Conference generally agreed  (a) That the scheme was unacceptable from aBritish point of view:(b) That the compulsory aspects of the-scheme should be resisted:(c) That delay should be insisted, on, on thecrcund that the scheme could not be putinto operation without the co-operationof the United States of America.-9-
jpfllAtf&quot;1 AN3^ (5) The-HCorreFrrmc-eJ^-erf&quot;&apos;the-attitude to be adopted by the British representative-- -. -on the Council of the League of Nations in relation to the. dispute between Poland and Lithuania.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat he was not satisfied that the Polish Government hadconnived at the occupation of Vilna, and pointed out thatafter the British and French ministers had made jointrepresentations on the subject to the Polish Governmentthe latter had definitely repudiated in the Diet the actionof General Zeligcwski.    Subsequently, Marshal Pilsudshi hadentirely associated himself with Zeligowski&apos;s troops and hadnxpr^ssod his intention to resign and throw in his lot withhis compatriots.    This attitude could not he disregarded&apos;, asPilsudshi was still a power to be reckoned with in Poland.As - a result of Lithuanian remonstrances, the League ofNations had taken up the matter, and M. Bourgeois was vigor-ouoly insisting on the evacuation of Vilna,    The French plan was .j,o get. rid of Pilsudski, to exact a definite pledge of4^good behaviour from tho Polish Government, and then leavethe questions of the evacuation of Vilna and the -future of;3?elis.h-Tiit.h^.n an.-relations to be settled by the League ofNations.    It might be possibility&quot; to solve the Vilna difficultyby means of a plebiscite, and negotiations  for a unionbet^^n Poland and Lithuania were not wholly out of thequestion.Cn the other hand, it was urged that whatever line the Polish Government might take, it- was unlikely that thePolish people would disavow the act of the army.    If itappeared, in the course of the next few days, that thePolish troops at Vilna werr b-uLng reinforced or sustainedfrom Poland, it would b.* clear that Poland was defying theAllies and the League of Nations.   The proper course wouldthen be to turn her out of the League -and-decline - any longer&apos;-&apos;to preserve her territorial integrity.
It, was generally ^p-^fpmlsed that in this matter it wasmest desirable to act in close co-operation with the FrenchGovernment, and. in this connection it was pointed out thatid&amp; Bourgeois, although not a Minister, was in the closeconfidence of his Government and in that of Ivi. Millerand.It was agreed  That Mr Balfour should have full authorityto deal, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, with the Polish-Lithuanian cuestion.
pE ECONOMIC (6) The Ccnferer.ee had before them a Note by the &apos; Seere-fcRGAiilSATIOKr EmE GUE tar*y t0 the Cabinet (Paper CP.-1968) covering a Memorandumon the Economic Organisation cf the league of Nations, whichhad been prepared by the Board of Trade.In this He; memorandum it was urged that the characterof the economic questions to be dealt with called for aConference o. Committee of Ministers of the various Statesresponsible for dealing with Trade and Industry, assisted,i* and when thought necessary, by expert advisers, but thatthe Conference or Committee should not comprise Irresponsibleindividuals selected ad hojj,., how ever competent or eminent.The Committee or Conference should not deal with Economic and finance questions, but should be concerned exclusively with commercial and Economic questions.    If necessary, a separateCommittee should be established to deal with Finance questions,leaving any adjustments of overlap to mutual discussion and.Joint Committees.   The Economic Conference or Committee should deal with questions on Trade,   Industry and Shipping, exolud-ing Finance, Labour, and Transit and Communications, otherthan Merchant Shipping, and should, in the first instance,eonsid*r tha stops to be taken to five effect to the variouseconomic obligations imposed on the League tinder the treaties of Peace, so far as they fall withfn the scope of the Confer-ence m Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that theTreasury entirely concurred in the vie!&quot;S expressed in theBoard o-r ^rade Memorandum.The Conference took note of, and approved,the recommendations contained in the &apos;ioardof Trade Memorandum.

The Conference had under consider iloh In connectionwith the Coal Strike the question of tho continuance of thoguaranteed standard nook for railwayman which was raised bytho finisten of Transport as a matter of urgency.     Under thoagreement with the railwnymen after the Railway Strike lastyear tho Railway ?;ane^ors had agrocd to a guaranteed week of48 hours, tart append d to this was a condition-that in theevent of a strike affecting the work of my &quot;grade either generally or In any district the question of suspending theoperation of the guaranteed week should be referred to thoJoint Committee of Managers and  enror.entotives of the men.Upon the reduction of trains in consequence of the Coal Strikeit would not be possible to find full employment for all those at present employed by tho Railway Companies, and it wasApart from the possibility of continuing the guaranteed weeknecessary to determine what should be done, / &quot;the government might -(1)    suspend the guaranteed week and nay time andovertime according to the number of hours worked;(S)   discharge a sufficient number of men to enablethe Companies to keep the whole of the restfully employedj(5)   postpone a decision on the natter until after the debate in Parliament on the following (Tuesday)afternoon.It was pointed out that the Joint Committee would meeton the following (Tuesday) morning arid the railwaymen1 s leadersno doubt boned to have      decision to put before the meetingof delegates on &quot;odnesday, October.20th, and if the guaranteedweek were refused it was quite likely that tho mooting would recommend a strike.     To keep all men on the standard week would involve the railways iii an additional cost of  500,000a week, 1        .  which could- not be covered by tho nor;railway rates and would fall as a direct lQ&amp;s upon twoJk:chequO-r lThe opinion- was expressed that it would be very difficultto keep the railway^railwaymen at work if a decision on the matter
were postponed., and that Mr. Cramp, who probably nan ted astrike, would be able to carry tho day at the delegate&apos;smeeting on m-dnesday, and that, therefore, tho cohtir nanceof the guaranteed week should be promised.     On the otherhand it was pointed out that thin voriel be a very great sign of weakness and that if the principle were agreed in the,case of the railwayman it could not be refused in other employments.The general view was that as tho coal situation was tobe donated in the House of Commons on the following afternoon and the general situation with, regard to the Coal strike had not yet had time to develop it would not be possible toplace a definite offer before tho railwayman the next morning.The Committee, therefore, agreedThat the Railway Managers should boinstructed to say that It would boimpossible to make a definite arrange-mont until after the Debate in theHouse of Commons and the further development of tho Coal Strike;should ask the men to say what they thought would be a fair arrangementjand should propose a further meetingof the Joint Committen to bo held on saturday, October SSrd,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.*&apos;.l.19th October 1920,

-&quot;3JJNEMPL-OYMSNT.       (1) The Conference had boon summoned at short notice,with refer.nee to Cabinet 55 (20), Conclusion ^3&apos;f or. ageneral discussion on the subject of unemployment, withspecial reference to the attitude to be taken up by Minis-&apos;- terc in the&quot; forthcoming Debate in Parliament.&quot;It was generally agreed that the question should be reviewed from the v/idest point of view, including, apartfrom the ad, hoc relief measures, every provision that hasbeen made for dealing with the problem of ex-Service men ,as shown in a Memorandum prepared by the Chancellor of theexchequer, which was circulated to the meeting (Gee, Appendix)e.e., Gratuities, Out rf-Work Donation, Resettlement Grants,the Industrial Training of Disabled Men, Interrupted Appren-&apos; ticeships, Land Settlement, Overseas Settlement, EducationalTraining.It was agreedThat the Minister of Labour should confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the&apos;Minister of Health, the Minister of Trans-port and other Ministers, in regard to theaspects of his review of the. problem ofUnemployment more especially concerningthem, and that those Ministers should hold themselves in readiness to take part in the Debate.1-
H8USING(2) The attention of the Conference was drawn to a Memo-randum circulated by the Minister of &quot;ealth to the Committeeon Unemployment (Paper 0.U.-47) in which it was stated thatif the proposals for building houses by ex-Service men wereto proceed expeditiously it wag estimated that a further 4,500,000 of capital would be required for the constructionef 10, 000 h ruses in London, and a similar provision in theProvine esaIt was stated that the additional expenditure did notarise *ut af the extra cost of employing unskilled labour,estimated by the Ministry of Health at  350 per house, but was due to the acceleration of the Housing Programme.    Thebuilding of a larger number of houses in the current year than had been originally contemplated would necessitateadditional borrowing by the Local Authorities,JHB BUILDING (3) The attention of the Conference was called to theTRADE. &apos; &apos;danger of making too strong an attack up*m the Building Trade.It was suggested that while the facts should be stated inthe House of Cacmons, that nothing had yet emerged fromnegotiations with the building industry for the admission of ex-Service men, which had been carried on since July, 1919,and that they had refused to admit disabled men who had been trained by the Ministry of Labour, Ministers should be careful in their speeches to avoid a deliberate attack atthis juncture, in order that the policy of the Governmentin relation to the coal/ strike might not be interpreted as&apos; ageneral attack upon Trade Unionism.    It was felt that thefacts in themselves were sufficiently convincing to.thepublic, who might be left to draw ftu&amp;p jrn conclusions,ILLEGAL (4) The Conference had under consideration a MemorandumDRILLINGIN SCOTLAND,    by the Secretary for Scotland (Paper C0P.-1978) on illegaldrilling in Scotland, covering a Memorandum by the lord advocate, in which it was stated that ex-Service men, somefew thousands in number, were being enrolled in Sinn Pein
organisations in Scotland for the purpose of drilling,particularly in and aroundLanarkshire.    It was also be-relieved that the Orangemen in Lanarkshire, who numbered somethousands, were also drilling.    The drillings had been going on for some months, but no. active steps had been taken toprevent or prohibit them,    The instructions of the cabinet were requested as to whether the offenders should be prose-cuted, and, If so,&apos;whether proceedings should be taken underthe Defence of the Realm Act or under an Act 60 George iii and 1 George IV, Cap. 1, which declared that meetings fortraining in the use of arms or military exercises withoutthe authority of the Sovereign, the lord Lieutenant or twoJustices of the Peace, were punishable on conviction bypenal servitude for the instructor and fine and imprisonmentup to two years for those attending the meeting.The attention of the Conference was called to thefact that the Police Forces in Scotland might not be adequate to deal with the situation which would arise if arrests weremade 0It was generally felt that the drilling referred towas a complete defiance of the law, and was particularly .dangerous at a time of industrial unrest, and must be stopped.It had been allowed in Ireland, with the result that it had increased to such an extent that it could not be controlled,and 1* now allowed in England and Scotland could only leadto disaster.The.suggestion was made that a nominal penalty shouldbe asked for in the first proceedings, by way of warning.The Conference agreed  (a) That the Home Secretary in England, andthe Secretary for Scotland, should beauthorised to arrange for the institu-tion of prosecutions under the Act60 George III and 1 George IV, Cap. 1,for illegal drilling!(b)That the Home Secretary and the Secre-tary for Scotland should arrange withthe Secretary of State for flar for theprovision of such troops as would benecessary to guard against resistance in the case of arrests.
government - (5) With reference to Cabinet 54 (SO)    Conclusion 3ISMPLCYEFS * &apos;^g^7pIf;RT the Conference had under consideration a Memorandum by theChancellor o^ the Exchequer (paper CP.-1977) on government employees and the Right to Strike, fr&apos;q?a which it appeared that the meeting of the Shipbuilding Trades Joint council had received with extreme disfavour the Cabinet decisionabove referred to on Strikes in the Civil Service, had stated their disbelief that it was anything - more than a treasury decree, and had demanded the names of the Ministerswhe subscribed to the decision.    The Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to instruct the Government representa-tives on the Joint Council to say that the matter-had beenconsidered by the Cabinet in the first place, who nowadhered to their decision, and that they might add,if they felt it desirable, that a Cabinet decision is a decisionof the whole Cabinet, for which all its members bear an equal responsibility.    Finally, rather than allow thedestruction of Whitleyism at this stage, or&apos;the resort todrastic action, they should invite the Staff side of theJoint Council to seek an interview with the Prime Ministerand other members of the Cabinet.It was stated that such a meeting could not takeplace until after the Coal Strike was settled.The Conference agreed  To approve the proposals of the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 21, 1920,

(1)   With reference to Cabinet 54-(EC), Conclusion 4,by whicJb. it was decided that the wages paid on, relief work for the unemployed &apos;should, during &amp; probationaryperiod of four months, be only 75 per cent, of thostandard district rate for vsork of tho same Kind, theConference bed under consideration an extract from theMinuted of a moating of the Unemployment Committee (C.U.7th Minutes, (8)), from which it appeared tnst greatdifficulty was anticipated in carrying out the decisionof the Cabinet *The Conference also had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (C.U.49) and a Memorandum bySir Henry Maybury (C.U.53) on the same subject.It was explained, on behalf of the Ministryof Transport, that in trie course of the negotiationsfor the contributions by Local authorities to thoschemes of road construction v;hieh were being under-taken &quot;the Local authorities had boon willing to con-tributo much more liberally then h--d boon anticipated,and in such circumstances the Ministry of transport had been under tho impression that the decision to limit we6s-:. to 75 per cent, of tho district&apos; ratebecame of small importance, particularly in view of theserious objection that would be taken to such a proposal by Local Authorities in every r.sxt of tho country.    Inconsequence of this, no/formal notification of tho,ages limit hea been made to them.The Conference were informed that all the other conditlolaid down by the Committee on Unemployment with regard to the selection for employment of unemployed men were being observed- Some discussion took neico *s to the effect or*&quot;&apos;adecision to pay full standard rates on the proposals to employ unemployed e-*-Service men on the   SousingSchemes, but it was pointed out that it was possibleto maintain a distinction in thia case end pay men
engaged on building work at lower rates during aperiod of apprenticeship, on the ground teat at theend of their time they v,ould be skilled craftsmenand qualified for the full wages of their craft.After hearing all the arguments, the conference were of opinion that it would be impossible to maintaintho Cabinet decision, particularly in view of the factthat no Local Authority would agree to employ men at less than the standard district rate, end that the men employed on road schemes would be working on the sameor similar jobs as men receiving the full rate ofwa&amp;es engaged on the ordinary work of the localAuthorities.The Conference accordingly agreed to recommend to the Cabinet -(a) That the decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet54 (20), Conclusion 4)/to pay only 75 percent, of the district rate on xoad work forthe unemployed during a probationary periodof four months should be reversed, and thatthe full standard district rate of wages-should be paid on schemes being undertaken by the Ministry of Transport for tho con-struction of arterial roads:Co) That the above decision must not beregarded as a precedent in future cases,having been taken in the special circum-stancss of the particular work, and thatthe Cabinet must not be taken as committed   ,to pay full Trade Union rates on relief work for the unemployed if at a laterdata schemes of relief on a largo scalobecame necessary.(2)    The attention of the Conference was called to the cae$ of a young man, aged 18 years and 9 months,who had been sentenced to death by a Court-martialfo- taming part in an attack on military in Ireland.He was to be hanged on the following Monday, and anappeal for mercy had been received by Mr. Devlin ontho ground of youth.
It was pointed out tn the Conference that three soldiershad boon murdered in the raid in question, that the prisonerhad been founo    ith a revolver, which had bech fired, in his hand,with one bullet in the barrel and two more in. the.magazine, and that It was precisely young and irresponsiblemen of this type who were the main cause of the presentdisturbances in Ireland.The Conference agreed :-That they could not recommend any eommu-tatior. of the death penalty.GERPJ (S)     The Chancellor oi the Exchequer stated that, afterjHAIIOjAIiS1IPROPSKTY.       consultation with the Foreign Office t. nd the Board of Tr^de.he had that day answered a Question In the House ofCommons in regard to the announcement by the Governmentof their intention not to exercise their rights under paragraph 18 of Annex II to  -rt VIII of the Treaty of&quot;Versailles to seize the property of German nationals inthis country In tha case of voluntary default by germany in respect&quot; of hor reps ration obligations.The Confer once concurred in the policy laid down, by the Chancellor of the Bx-chequer in his reply.2, Whitehall Gardens, 3..M.,October 28, 19SO.

wireless telegraphy andVisual SignallingBill.1. The Committee had under consideration a memorandum \jthe Postmaster-General (CP.-1953) covering the draft of a Bill toamend and make permanent the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1904,by which the Postmaster-General has power to control wireless telegraph installations in the United Kingdom. The intention&apos; ofthe Bill, which embodies the recommendations of an [nter-Depart-mental Committee, is to secure proper control of wireless telegraphinstallations so as to reduce interference, with communication to aminimum. It was stated on behalf of the Colonial Gffice that the insertion of a clause was desired to ensure that the Hill should notapply to ships or aircraft registered in the Dominions when outsideBritish territorial waters. Sir Henry Lambert, on behalf of theSecretary of State for the Colonies, read to the Committee the draftof a clause which had been prepared for this purpose (see Appendix).The Committee decided That the draft clause should be circulated and considered bythe Committee at their next meeting.Some discussion took place on clause 8 of the Bill, which givespower to the Postmaster-General during an emergency to control the possession and use of apparatus for wireless telegraphy or visual signaling in order to avoid the delay which might otherwise beentailed in obtaining the necessary legislative authority. some criticism was made of the wide terms in which the clause was drafted :&quot; When in the opinion of the Secretary of State an emergencyhas arisen in which it is expedient for the public service,&quot; &amp;c, &amp;c.It was suggested, on the one hand, that words should be insertedto define the emergency contemplated, and that the clause as draftedwas too vague to meet with acceptance in the House of Commons.On the other hand, the view was held that it would be impossible to define an emergency with precision, and that the better coursewould be to insert words analogous to those contained in theEmergency Powers Bill now before Parliament to secure that theHome Secretary or the Postmaster-General should report toParliament within a stated time after an emergency had been declared. It was stated, on behalf of the Air Ministry, that it wasvery important to have power to check interference with wirelesscommunication in a time of crisis, although so grave an emergency asthat contemplated in the Emergency Powers Bill had not actuallyarisen. It was also slated that in the opinion of the Admiralty itwould be unwise to limit the power of the Postmaster-General bydenning the kind of emergency contemplated.The Committee agreed To request the Parliamentary Counsel to prepare a clause forconsideration at their next meeting on Friday, the 29thOctober, on the lines of the provision in the emergency powers Bill (a.) Defining the kind of emergency during which itwas contemplated the powers in clause 8 of theBill should be exercised.(b.) Requiring the Secretary of State to report toParliament within a stated time after declaringan emergency.Washington Con-vention on theemployment ofWomen before andafter Childbirth.&apos; 2. The Committee had under consideration a memorandum bythe Minister of Health (CP. 1919) on the draft Convention of theInternational Labour Conference at Washington concerning theemployment of women before and after childbirth. It was stated inthe memorandum that the Minister of Health, while sympathising
with the motives animating the Washington Conference in framing the Convention, was of opinion that the best course would be for theGovernment to decline to adhere to it under the option provided by article 405 of the Peace Treaty, basing his decision on the ground of the provision already made for maternity benefit, sickness benefit,maternity and child-welfare centres and similar institutions; the true line of advance being the systematic expansion and developmentof our present policy as experience dictates and finance permits.The Committee agreed (1.) To approve the course proposed by the Minister of Health.(2.) To request the Minister of Health in making arrangementsfor the communication of this policy to the InternationalLabour Office to confer with the Ministry of Labour as tothe procedure to be adoptedLiquor Control 3. The Committee had under consideration a memorandum by(Temporary Pro- the President of the Board of Education (C.P.-1964.) coveringvision) Bill. alternative drafts of a Bill  to make temporary provision withrespect to the continuance of the Liquor Control Regulationspending the introduction of permanent legislation. The memorandum was accompanied by a statement by Sir John Pedder, the ActingChairman of the Central Control Board. (Liquor Traffic), in whichit was pointed out that unless fresh Parliamentary sanction were obtained the present control of the liquor traffic was in danger of breaking down. Both draft Bills had as their essential features(1) to bring the power of liquor control surviving from the warinto proper constitutional responsibility to Parliament; (2) toenable those powers to be exercised in every part of the country without the artificial limits imposed by the war conditions underwhich they originated. The difference between the drafts was that draft &quot;A.&quot; continued the Central Control Board under a parliamentary Chairman, while draft &quot;B&quot; vested its powers and- duties in the Home Secretary ; or, alternatively, the Home secretary in respect of England and Wales, and the Secretary for scotland in respect of Scotland. Some discussion took place as to the relativeadvantages of the two drafts. The general view of the Committeewas that both on grounds of constitutional theory and for political reasons it would be preferable to abolish the Central Control Boardand to transfer its authority to the Home Secretary and the Secretaryfor Scotland respectively, following the lines of draft &quot; B.&quot; It was explained that the working organisation of the Central control board could be transferred to the Home Office without difficulty,and there would be no need to set up a new staff. So far as concerns Scotland, the same staff could be made responsible to theSecretary for Scotland in respect of Scotch business. The question was raised whether it would be advisable to insert in the Billprovision for advisory committees for England and Wales, but theCommittee were of opinion that while an amendment to this effectmight be accepted if the point were raised during the debate inthe House of Commons, it was unnecessary to provide for it in theBill as introduced.It was explained to the Committee that the details of the draftBill would require to be further elaborated before it was ready for introduction.The Committee agreed (1.) To approve draft &quot; B &quot; of the alternative Bills submitted.(2.) To request the Parliamentary Counsel to draw the Bill insuch a form that could, if necessary, be renewed from year to year under the Expiring Laws Continuance Act.
r(3.) That the Bill as finally drafted should be referred top/ 3Chairman for his approval ; but need not be brought back to the Committee.(4.) That  the  Bill  should be introduced in the House ofCommons by the Chairman or the Home Secretary, thematter to be settled between them.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.October 27, 1920.APPENDIX.The Principal Act as amended by this Act shall not extend to British ships or british aircraft registered in the self-governing Dominions, that is to say the dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia (including for this purpose the territory ofPapua and Norfolk Island), the Dominion of. New Zealand, the Union of SouthAfrica and Newfoundland, while outside the British islands and the territories abuttingon the coast thereof.o

1.       With reference to H*A*C, 73rd Minutes, Co :c1ul ion[public.E3ALTH 3, the Committee had before them a memorandum (C.P.20I4)!(!UB3ECUX0SIS)BILL. by the Minister of Health covering a revised draft of th*Public Health (Tubarculo^ie) Bill,   from this memo ranit appeared that the Ministry of Health had, as directed by the previous minute of the Committee, consulted theTreasury on the outstanding point in ro^ard to thefinancial measures referred to in Clause 5 of the Bill.Tho Scottish Office had also been consulted on the Billgenerally, and s clause had been inserted providing forthe application of certain parts of the Bill teScotland.&apos;with regard to the bu^estion made on the previous discussion that tho Ministry of Health should examinea propos-X that oecaaion should be talceft by means afthe Bill to abolish the machinery of insurance committees, the Committee wore Informed that althoughsanatorium benefit would be discontinued, insurance committees would still have important duties %&amp;- dis*charge, more particularly in ro^ard to the provisionof medical benefit for insured persons.     It wastherefore considered impracticable to abolish themachinery of Insurance Committees by means of thepresent Bill.The committee  agreedTo sanction the introduction oftho Public Health (Tuberculosis) bill into Parliament at an early datoaWDJKMBH^S 8.   The Committee had before them the following papersMemorandum by the Home Secretary covering report of a Departmental Committee(CP.1746) on the Isf relating toWorkmen1 s Compenaatiw.
lieiaoranda by tho Minister of Health(C.P*1768, and C.P,1914).Memo rand urn by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C.P.1780)In view of the fact that the Chairman *&apos;s prewas required in the Hotue of Com ons during the? debate on tho Hone Mule 3111, tho Committee agreedTo postpone consideration of wortoen&apos;ecompensation until a further meetingwhen the Chairman could be proacut.3.     The Commit too had under consideration s moinoraadumby the Parliamentary Draughtsman (CP. 2011) covering the draft of a 3111 to authorise Government departments and Local Authorities to enter upon and acquire landfor the purpose of carrying out thereon works of publicutility, with a view to providing immediate employment for unemployed persons.Tho Committee were of opinion that the powerscontained   in the Bill which would enable GovernmentDepartments when undertake rig relief work for theunemployed - e.g., the ministry of Transport inconnection   ith the new schemes for road construction -to enter upon lend ami acquire it eompulsorlly without giving the owner any opportunity to be hoary, was toodrastic to be accepted by Parliament,It v.-ss oUggostod that all thst was required was that the ministry of Transport or other GovernmentDepartment concerned with the provision of v;prk for therelief of the unemployed should be endowed with similarpowers to those onjoyed by the ministry of Health inrespect of the compulsory acquisition of land.for housing
viz.,  the power to confirm an order made by a LocalAuthority,  puttin- in force the provisions of the LandClauses Acts in respect of certain specified land,  theowner being given notice before the order was confirmedand having an opportunity to make objection.    The LocalAuthority under section 10 of the Housing and Town planning act is able to enter on the lane before compensation ispai d.It was suggested that in practice the Ministry ofHealth found that as a result of the powers acquired bythe pousinand Town planning Acts 1900-1919, the averagetime required for the compulsory acquisition of land was only 4 weeks fro., the making of an Orcer by a LocalAuthority.The Co mm i 11 e e a ;r e e d : -That tho Draft &quot;ill should be referred back to the parliamentary Counsel to be re-drafted on the basis of vesting the Ministryof Transport or other appropriate depart-ments with powers of compulsorily acquiringland analogous to those of the Ministry ofHealth in reppect of lana acquired forhousin %4.     With reference to Home Affairs Committee, Minute 74,Conclusion (1) the. committee had under considerationcertain proposed amendments to the wireless Telegraphy andVisual signalling Bill, viz., a note by the secretary(l7/p/4o)  oovering tho draft of a clause prepared by theColonial Office; the ahlici tor-dene ral&apos; 3 observationsthereon, and a re-draft of Clause 8 submitted, by parliamentary counsel in accordance with the instructions of the Confrd11e e abb ve referred to.(a) The Colonial office amendment proposed that :-The wireless Telegraphy Act, 19q4 as amended by the Bill under consideration should not extend to British Ships or British aircraft
re ristered in the self-governing Dominions,that is to say, the Dominion of Canada, theCommonwealth of Australia (inducing forthis purpose the territory of Papua andNorfolk Island)  the Dominion of New zealand the Union of south Africa and Newfoundland,while outside the British islands and theterritorial abutting on the Coast thereof.The Solicitor-General in his Tferaorandum suggested thatthe last tv:o lines should bt amended by substituting forthe words &quot;out sice the British Islands and the territorialabutting on the coast thereof.&quot; - &quot;while within theterritorial waters abutting on the coasts of the saidDominion3.&quot;Sir Henry Lambert on behalf of the Colonial Officestated that the solicitor-Central *s amendment if adoptedwould involve a breach of constitutional practice whichhad prevailed since 1908, that the Imperial Governmentwould not pass legislation applying to ships registered in the Dominions.    It was pointed out on the other hand,that the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904, which it was pro-posed to amend by the- Bill under consideration in factapplied to ship3 registered in the Dominions.    It wascontended.on the other hand that the Act had never beenenforced in respect of Dominion ships and that as the wireless Telegraphy Act, 19o4, which had hitherto beenrenewed from year to year was to be made permanent by theproposed Bill; the constitutional point must be takenfully into consideration.The Committee were of opinionThat in view of the absence of theChairman and the solicitor-General thematter should be adjourned for fullerconsideration at a later meeting.(b)   The committee considered the re-draft of Clause 8(17/d/4q/1) in which an endeavour was made to define more precisely the nature of the emergency in which the post-master-General might exercise his powers to control the possession and use of wireless apparatus.The committee agreed :-
(l) That Clause 0 should stand as originally drafted, J(2) That there should he added, theretosub-section 2 of the redraft, which requires that any rules made underthe Clause shall he laid beforeparliament as soon as may be,  thatthe words in brackets in sub-section of the re-draft should be omittedand that sub-section 3 relatingto the extent of the penalty for a breach of the rules should also beadded to the Clause .Vfoltehall Gardens, s.Y/.29th October, 1920-
