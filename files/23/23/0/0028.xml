future Policy The--Cabinet Tere-inforr-ied by the Secretary of State foz376as regardsMesopotamia^ War. that at the moment the military position in Mesopotar. ia.(.. might be regarded as secure.    The Arab rebellion bad been definitely broken, and 35,000 rifles, of which 10,COG weremodern rifles,, had been surrendered,    The forces in Persiawere to be withdrawn in the Spring, as soon as the passeswere open, but until this withdrawal had been effected itwas not possible to begin any withdrawal of troops from theMosul vilayet.    &quot;Phis meant that if the Cabinet came to theconclusion that the major part of Mesopotamia should be evae-uated and only the Basra vilayet held, the withdrawal wouldtake place next summer in the hot weather, at a time whenit was more than probable that we should be attached by theArabs,  the Turks and possibly by the Bolsheviks.    In this event the withdrawal wonId undoubtedly be considerably delayedand at the earliest could not be completed before March, 1923.On the basis of unhampered withdraw:-.1 he estimated military expenditure in Mesopotamia in the financial year 1921-22 at from  2-0,000,00C to  22,000,000.    It would be very difficultto get this money from the House of Commons,  and if the evacuated-ation was interrupted by hostile elements the resulting addi-tional expense would be very heavy.    There were two alterna-tive policies.(i) The Cabinet might decide to get back as&apos;quickly as possible to the Basra line, *regardless of the political consideration-tions and of the anarchy and chaos inHorthern Mesopotamia which would inevit-ably follow a withdrawal of this kind.If this policy were adopted it would be necessary to take measures to secure that the local rmilita:ties zealously acquiesced in tho Cabinet-decision.(ii) If tha Cabinet recoiled from tho drastic,policy outlined in (i) above, and itsconsequences,  then the only alternative was to create at once a Department the ministerial head of which should be- responsible for the policy and for ob-tainlngthe money to carry,out that policy.
Future Policy The -Cabinet&apos; -m3re-d.trform.6d bv the Secretary of State for 1as regardsMesopotamia.   War. that at. the moment the military position in Mesopotamiamight be regarded as secure.    The Arab rebellion had been definitely broken, and 35,000 rifles, of which 10,000 weremodern rifles4. had been surrendered.    The forces in Persiawere to be withdrawn in the Spring, as soon as the passeswere open, but until this withdrawal had been effected itwas not possible to begin any withdrawal of troops from theMosul vilayet.    This meant that if the Cabinet came to theconclusion that the major part of Mesopotamia should be eyae-uated and only the Basra vilayet held, the withdrawal wouldtake place next summer in the hot weather, at a time whenit was more than probable that we should be attacked by theArabs,  the Turks and possibly by the Bolsheviks.    In this event the withdrawal would undoubtedly be considerably delay?and at the earliest could not be completed before March, 1923On the basis of unhampered withdraw:! he estimated military expenditure in Mesopotamia in the financial year 1921-22 at from  20,000,000 to  22,000,000.    It would be very difficultto get this money from the House of Commons, and if the evacuation was interrupted by hostile elements the resulting addi-tional expense would be very heavy.    There were two alterna-tive policies:- .(i) The Cabinet might decide to get back as quickly as possible to the Basra line, *regardless of the political considera-tions and of the anarchy and chaos innorthern Mesopotamia which would inevit-ably follow a&quot;withdrawal of this kind.If this policy were adopted it would be necessary to take measures to secure that&apos;the local military and civil author1ties zealously acquiesced in tho Cabinet&apos;s decision.(ii) If the Cabinet recoiled from tho drastic ,policy outlined in (i)  abo^e, and. itsconsecuences,  then the only alternative was to create at oriee a department the ministerial head of which should be- responsible for the policy and tor oh-tainingtho mee-ey fo carry out that police-.
-Hitherto &apos;the-arrangements -in this r-spect had been most unsatisfactory.    The War Office had had to carry on Armyvot^s and defend hea-y expenditure in respect of policiesdirected by other Departments.    By adapting/&apos;/&quot;&quot;it -might, .andprobably would, be possible to secure .a. cheaper Administra-tion..  -At any rate, the ne-.v Department could view the situa-tlo:n as a whole and take action accordingly.    On the whole,he was disposed to favour the second alternative.In the course of the discussion which followed the state-ment by the Secretary of State for War, it was represented that the adoption of the first alternative, namely, a retire-ment to the Basra line, would be a grave political blunder.In this connection special reference was made to the Reply-given by. the Pri e Minister to Mr Asquith irvthe House cfCommons on June 23, 192C, quoted in Paper C.P.-23G.0, and itwas suggested that there was a third alternative, namely, areduction of military commitments in - two years time, afterthe new Arab Government had been set up and after successfulnegotiations with the Turks had resulted in a stable Peacewith Turkey.-  It was represented that Great Britain could notstop at Basra, and, indeed, had no moral right to stop there.It would be wrong to seize Mesopotamia&apos;s only port and leavethe whole hinterland to ruin and anarchy.In this connection the Cabinet were referred to a tele-gram dated December 27, 1920, from Sir Percy Cox, reproduced in Paper CP.-2379, in the fourth paragraph of which it wassuggested that if the Wmir Feisal became King of Mesopotamiahis advent would serve to satisfy national sentiment for ayear or two and to keep the country contented, in which casethe Army of Occupation might be reduced to ^n^Javision forthe Baghdad and Mosul vilayets, and one Brigade distributed between Amara, Kama, Kfasiriyah and Basra.It was pointed out that if Peisal was made King withthe assent o&quot;r tho Arabs., the most serious danger of disturb-ahce fromv3yria and other Arab territories would be removed.
The trouble, in Mesopotamia came mainly from outside, and if the countries around Were pacified, Mesopotamia would probablysettle down and would then be comparatively easy to administer.In this connection reference was made to a recent telegram fro?Colonel Stokes, at Tiflis,  indicating the terms which theTurkish Nationalists were alleged to be read,; to accept inreturn for peace.    These terms included the return to Turkeyof Smyrna, Constantinople to be Turkish but under some for;; efAllied control, and no surrender of any&apos;of the Turkish property -vinees without a plebiscite of the inhabitants.i&amp;s Depart- Jit this- point the Cabinet decided to discuss the questioniient foraddle East-   ef a new Department for Middle Eastern Affairs, and to returnern Affairs.-later to the&apos; question of the withdrawal from Mesopotamia.It was represented that it would be highly desirable toplace the whole of the territories in the Middle East, inwhich Great Britain was closely interested, under one control.This control would cover Constantinople, Persia, Mesopotamia,the Persian Gulf, Aden, Arabia, Palestine, and Egypt,    The best solution might be to have a completely new Department under anew Minister, but this was in any case ruled out by Parlia-mentary and other objections.    The alternative was to set upa new sub-Department of either the Foreign office or theColonial Office, under an Under-Secrotary responsible to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs or the Secretary efState for the Colonies, as the case might be.    This new Sub-Department would have to -reeru.it its staff specially.The discussion revealed a difference of opinion as towhether the new Sab-Department should bo placed under theColonial Office or,&apos;/the Foreign Office.    In &quot;favour of theColonial Office it was urged that the work of administrationwculd be similar in character to that which the ColonialOffice was already accAistoined to do and which it had donesuccessfully in the past.    fn the other hand, it was urged
that tha - Collar frfflee--had^lready&quot;as.much to&quot; do a.s. if    ^could manage; and that while territories under the &quot;B&quot; am*C* !5andates could be administer-a like ordinary british colonies, and Protectorates, countries like Mesopotamia and palestine, under the &quot;A&quot; Mandate, were in a different posi-    1tier.In favour cf the new Sub-Department being placed under theForeign Office, it was pointed cut that a large part of them the Middle Eastwork/was already being done by that Department (notably thisanplied to Egypt, Persia, Constantinople and Arabia);    thatit was most undesirable to treat the problem otherwise than as a whole;    and that there -ouldfce most serious difficultiesIn Egypt if, say, a suggestion were to be made that theresponsibility for Egyptian affairs was to be transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.    Cn the otherhand, it was contended that it was net the business of theForeign Office to undertake administration., that if it did so its diplomacy would tend to get out of focus, andthere would be a tendency to Concentrate on the business which.-affected the territories for the administration of which theForeign Office was responsible.    The outlook and temperamentof administrators arid diplomats were quits different,  and itwas represented that to place Palestine and Mesopotamia underForeign Pffioe administration would be to court failure anddisaster.,.After some further discussion, the Cabinet resumed theconsideration of the question of the evacuation of Mesopotamia,when it was generally agreed that seme further information from Sir Percy Cox on&apos; tho subject of his telegram of December27th was desirable.In this connection, the Cabinet were warned by the&apos;Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the placing cf /tho Emir Feis.al on the throne o? Mesopotamia would certainly involve Croat Britain in trouble with France, who would regard it as a challenge to hsr position in Syria.
He reminded the Cabinet that the French Government hadalready intimated that, they would.regard British supportof Peisal in Mesopotamia as an unfriendly act.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That responsibility for the whole ofthe administration of the mandatary     .-territ ories of Mesopotamia/^uld&quot; olT^concentrated in a single Department,* which should bear on its financialj Votes the whole of the expenses bothI Civil and Military:(b) That, as a counsel of perfection, thebest plan would be the establishmentof a new Ministry for the purpose, butthat at the present time this proposal would not be acceptable to Parliament:(c.)  (By a majority! That the new department should be sot up as a branch of theColonial Office, which should be given some new title, such as the&quot;department for Colonies&apos;and Mandated Territories&quot;:(d) That the. Secretary of State for theColonies, in consultation with the headsof tho other Departments concerned(Foreign Office, India Office, war Office,and Treasury)  should appoint an Inter-departmental Committee to work out details,;including the date of the transfer:(e) That, in the meantime, the responsibility should remain as at present:(f) That, with a view to a decision as to our general polio;-; in Mesopotamia, the Sec re-tar y of State&quot; for India should send atelegram to the High Commissioner of Maso-potamia in some such terms as the following:-&quot;The suggestion in your telegram -Jo. (R) 124 S-of 27th December that Sheroef Feisal should become King at once is under consideration,Cabinet would like to have further detailsas to. how far his candidature would beli acceptable to the various elements of pep-&apos; uDation, both Arab and non-Arab,- includinginhabitants of Baghdad and other citizen.es.Would he be likely to be elected by notables?We understand that if he wero so sleeted and supported by British Government, you would expect to be able to reduce total Army ofOccupation, to one division and one brigadewithin. 12 months of el-ction&quot;.  *

(1) With reference to Cabinet &amp;l   -Minute-6,   ihe Confer-eno** considered a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour cnCuo-&apos;f-yvhrk Donation and Unemployment Insurance (paper cp.-20S6).    The Memorandum pointed out that the extensionof Cut-of-Worh Donation at SO/- a week frr ex-Servioe mencome;! to an end this week, ana the Unemployment Insurance Actcomes into force.    The Act made no provision for the largenumber of ox-Service men belonging to trades not previouslyinsured who may still bo unemployed.    Tn meet this Jituaticr.the Memorandum indicated two possible couraee:    either toextend the present Donation for a further period,, or topass a short Act amending the Unemployment Insurance Actand increase the benefit under that Act forthwith to 30/-and fix a higher rate of Contributions from employers and workmen, to be paid as seen as the necessary administrative-......&quot;j.arrangements could be made.    The Amending Act shuild also provide a special benefit to ex-Sarviee men enabling themto receive SO/- a week for a maximum of 15 weeks betweenthe date when it is passed and the beginning of July next.On behalf of the second crarse it was urged by the Minis-try of Labour that it had the advantage ef absorbing thespecial class of ex-Service men into the insured poyula-   .tion of the country,, ant that the cost of the increasedben^+dts in the interim period might fairly fall on the accumulated balance of the Unemployment Purid, inasmuch as that Pun:! had grown largely owing to good employmentduring the War and to the operation of the Out-of-WcrkDonation since the WainThere were, however, in tho opinion of the Conference,Important Parliamentary objections to the proposal toamend an Act which had not yet come into force, and tcamend it in a direction which had b- en advocated in aCommittee of the House of Oormcns and strenuously resisted by the Cabinet only a few months ago.
The  ^ inference agreed  (a) To a further extension of Cut-of-workDonation under the sane conditions asat present, fcr a period of 15 weeks, to end on March 31, 1921:(b) That in announcing the decision,.theMinister of Labour should state that thereafter whatever provision is foundnecessary for unemployment would be made through the Unemployment Insurance Act.(2) With reference to the 7th Minutes of the HomeA-^airs Committee, the Conference had before them a Memo-randum by the Minister of Labour dealing with the Pair wages resolution passed by the House of Commons in 1909 (paper c,P.-2016).    Repeated representations had been made by theTrade Union Congress that the resolution should be extendedso as tc embrace firms who, while paying fair wages forwork done on Government contracts, were alleged not to bepaying fair rates on their private work.    When the matter was considered by the Home Affairs Committee the extensionwas generally supported, and it was believed that the contracting Departments of the Gov-&apos; rnraent would offer no opposition.The Conference agreed  .(a) To r-commend that the Cabinet should issiieinstructions that Government ContractingDepartments should exclude from the listof approved extractors, firms which havebeen shown to the satisfaction of the De-partments concerned not to observe theprinciples of the Resolution as regardsrates of wages or hours of labour in respectef either Government work or private work:(b) That no Parliamentary announcement wasnecessary.OBTAINING (3) With reference to bar Cabinet 586, Conclusion 3, thefUPPLIES BY?AMILTES CP Conference had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord ofAVAL CFFIC-3RS AND MEN.    the Admiralty (Paper CP.-1910) suggesting that permissionshould be given to the families of officers and men of theRoyal Navy to purchase provisions from the Navy and ArmyCanteen Poard.1UR WAGES SOLUTION,o
It was explained, on behalf of the War Office, that early in the now year, the Naval, Army and Air Force Insti-tutea organisation -.ould tabs the place of the existingCanteen Hoard, and it was undesirable to make any change ofpolicy at the moment,    Tho War Office h -d received very strong representations from Chambers of Commerce and Munici- -municipalities protesting against the extension of Governmenttrading by the Fighting Services,The Conference agreed  To adjourn the question until Sir laming worthington Evans and the Food Controllercould be present.Whitehall Gardens, S..V.1,November 4, 1920.

informed   by the Secretary of State for War that in thecourse of the   next week he would find himself obliged toIntroduce In the   House of Commons a supplementary estimate (allowing a margin of safety of .84,000,000 or 5,000,000) of  35,000,000 or  34,000,000.     The actualestimated deficiency was  45,000,000, but by usingsavings which had materialised on several sub-heads ofthe Vote he was able to bring the gross figure down tothe amount named.     The Supplementary Estimate, the amountof which   was greater than anything within his experience,was in the main due to expenditure in Mesopotamia,   this additional expenditure had largely been incurred on behalfof the Indian Government, but other Departments, such asthe Foreign Office, were also affected,     The War office had been obliged to borrow troops from India, which india was most reluctant to lend and for which she charged veryhighly.     He   wished to emphasise the difficulties which inevitably arose when Departments like the War office had to bear on their Votes the cost of policies over whichthey had no control.     In his own case, the War Office was called, upon to provide funds for the development ofPalestine and Mesopotamia, and, to a lesser degree, Egypt0While the War Office was prepared to find troops if andwhen necessary, he wished to urge that the cost of theseventures in the Hear East should be debited to the Vote of.the Department the Minister in charge of which was respon-sible&apos; for the policy and could effectively control theexpenditure.Proceeding further into detail, the Secretary ofState for War mentioned the following Mesopotamian items &apos;included in the Supplementary Estimate m-PersiaStoresRe-r c conditions t i oni ng ofrailway Stock&quot;itji 1SuTFLEMEHIARY With reference &quot;to the meeting of the Finance CommitteeARMY ESTIMATES.,held.-nnThursd.a3r, July 22nd, 1920, the Conference were 33,000,006, 2,000,000, 1,600,000,
Itemo of this kind, particularly the&apos;-last.-named item, should 0 10in his view, have been charged to the Mesopotamlan Budget andnot debited against Army Funds.     In reply to his request forproposals for reducing the hesopotamian garrison, GeneralHaldane had supplied his&apos; views on the situation very fully in telegram 18/J/S3, circulated to the Cabinet on December1st, 1920.The Conference were reminded that the origin, of thearrangements in Mesopotamia which had resulted in throwingthe cost of the administration on to War Office funds, wasthat, pending the conferring on Great Britain of the mandate for Mesopotamia, tire only justification for our being in thecountry was that of Military occupation.It was represented, that the system which enabled one department to incur expenditure -which the Minister in chargeof another Department had tc bear on his Vote, was from financial and Parliamentary points of view, vicious and difficult to justify.     On the other hand it was pointedout that as soon, as a situation had been taken over by theMllItary....ArMfa()x:i..tlss,. the latter claimed to. decide questionsof the -highest mUmuermance -on purely military grounds wit] outreference to the Civil Authority or to the Department thatwas responsible for policy.For Instance, reference was made to the permission whichhad been given for women and children to proceed to mesopotamia and for the establishment by the Gesssral Officer Commandingon his own responsibility and at great expense, of a HillStation at Karind, in Persia.The Secretary of State for War then passed on to a detailed comparison of the new Estimate with the Estimateoriginally submitted by him to his colleagues 12 monthspreviously, and the Estimate as subsequently cut down after discussion in the Finance Committee of the Cabinet, whichlatter wa3 ultimately submitted to Parliament.     the comparative figures are contained in the statement attacl 3dto these Minutes (See Appendix L),    It should be observedthat the net amount of the Supplementary Estimate was
 29,000,000, to which, however, it would he wise to add 4,000,000 or  5,000,000 for emergencies, making the totalSupplementary  30,000,000 or  34,000,000,     In connectionwith the figures., the Secretary of State pointed out thathe had latl   his plans on the basis of having a large force for police purposes., rather than a large army containingmany semi-trained units.     It wee necessary to proceed withrecruiting because of the heavy wastage which would take placenext year.     Compared with Mesopotamia, Ireland was a smallaffair, and only accounted for an additional  1,000,000.Broadly speaking, we had only lost in Ireland one-tenth ofthe men, end Ireland had only cost one-tenth of the moneyexpended in Mesopotamia,&apos;    With regard to Constantinople, theactual cost was   estimated at  3^000,000 against  2,800,000taken in the Estimate,     As regards Egypt, the estimated&apos;figure seemed likely to be realised, but there would be no substantial excess.     In regard to Palestine the cost wouldbe  5,730,000 as against the revised estimate of  4,350,000,Comment was made:., on the heavy expenditure in Palestine,and it was representedr-thal-^hi^-was am clear ease where theheavy costs were due Vo&quot;Military requirements and were notimposed on the military by the civilian authorities,, It was pointed out that a substantial portion of the supplementary Estimate of  33,000,000 or  34,000,000 was required to satisfy payments for serviseo rendered by otherDepartments      for example, a sum cf over  3,000,000 wouldbe payable to. the Ministry of Shipping Vote for re-condition-ing vessels used as military transports   and it was suggestedthat items of this character, which did not involve actualcash payments, should not be included in the Supplementary.It was pointed out, however, that if the expenditure was not shown on the War Office Vote it would be necessary for theother Department, e,ga, the Ministry of S?aipping, to take a supplementary Estimate,After some further discussion, the Chancellor of theExchequer agreed to make enquiries into certain payments
which had been specifically referred to, namely, a payment to the German Government in respect of the mages of german prisoners in England, and the cost of re-conditioningrailway material in Mesopotamia,     &quot;If necessary,Sir Warren Fisher would himself investigate the matter withthe War Office officials, with a view to seeing whetheritems of this character could not be dealt with in some other way so as to relieve the War Office Vote from undue chargesupon it.The &quot;d&amp;ssa&amp;asion then passed to the political aspectsof the quoe&amp;ioiis ..at..i.s&amp;&amp;a*. and the. view was generally accepted that the   House of Commons would only grant the supplementary Estimate on receiving an assurance that this represented the end of the heavy military expenditure,particularly in the &quot;Near East,     Criticism of the Government1 expenditure was becoming every day more insistent, particularly from the GovernmentJsu own supporters, and it was clear thatthe   country would demand that the permanent military expenditure of the future should be vigorously reduced.This was especially the case as regards Mesopotamia and persia, and it was represented that the country would favour a policy under which the Army would be withdrawn from persia and Mesopotamia, the government of Mesopotamia In futurebeing entrusted to the Arab Admlnlstration, helped by nativelevies   and a   small British force.     As regards Persia, theConference were reminded of the decision already taken towithdraw the British forces still in that country in the spring, as soon as the passes were open (Cabinet 59 (20),Conclusion 4),The Conference agreed That the Secretary of State for War should base Ms Estimates on the assumption thatall British forces would be withdrawn from persia as soon as the passes were open nextyear. uAs regards Mesopotamia, the. suggestion was again made that in future it would suffice to limit the area which was       .occupied and administered by Great Britain,     In th &amp;s
connection the Conference were informed that Jagaar Pasha,tho new Minister ef Defence in the Arab Administraion, estimatedthat Mesopotarmia would require a smaller permanent garrisontlian in Turkish times.     He proposed to raise a defence force for this purpose by means of a quota from each vilayet)probably by compulsory services the Conference were also informed that Sir Percy Comwas pressing on rapidly with the development of an ArabAdministration, and had already replaced half the british political Officers by Arabs.It was represented that Mesopotamia could only headministered economically if the hostility of the Kemmlistswas disarmed, and that if the   policy of the British Governmentwas tc continue to quarrel with Mestapha Kemal it would benecessary either to clear out of Mesopotamia altogether orto hold it in force.     A combination of the Bolsheviks andthe Kemallsts would be most dangerous, whereas by negotiating with Kemal, who was stated to he anxious for a settlement,it   would he possible to extricate the troops without difficulty and to run the country in future on the lines whichhad been suggested^The Conference were asked not to sanction any statement about a reduction of the Mesopotamia^ garrison withoutSir Percy Cox being first consulted.     They were reminded that the recent outbreak in Mesopotamia had-only been possibleowing to the widespread belief among the natives that we wereabandoning the country,.     It must, therefore, be made clearthat our Intention was to replace the British and indian troops by native levies..The Conference were also Informed that the evidenceshowed that the Turks were behind the recent ourbreak, whichhad been-largely engineered from without.     In view of possible - threats, to Mesopotamia next year from Bolshevist
and Kemallst forces, it was urged that the date on which theactual withdrawal could be effected depended on the natureof the progress made with any negotiations opened with mustapha Kemal.The Conference agreed -That a telegram should be sent to sir percy Cox (See Appendix tl) to the effectthat the growing demand at home forretrenchment made it necessary to reconsider the Mesopotamian policy, and asking him foran estimate of the smallest number of troops,British and Indian, which It would be necessaryto retain In Mesopotamia during the financialyear 1921-22, and what further reductions couldbe made in the following years: further, would it be possible to concentrate for the presentand re-establish our position In outlyingdistricts as the Arab Array developed.(As the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for India,had to leave the Conference, it was decidedto adjourn, further consideration of thequestions raised to a meeting to be held at12-15 p,m. on the following day, December 2nd,1920 )91 O M M o sOvQe 9 6 9 &amp; 9 Q2, Whitehall &quot;Gardens, S,W,December 1st, 1920,

I am very reluctant to trouble you with financial difficulties in Jai&amp;at of your other urgent pra-occupatiors.     But situation here is really serious in viewof universal and often unreasoning demand for economy in alldirections and I foresee great difficulty in csouringcontinued support for our Mesopotamian policy either from parliament or from my colleagues in the Cabinet unless can hold cut to them some assured prospect of progressiveretrenchment.     It would greatly assist mo if you couldestimate roughly what is smallest purposes-ber cf troops Britishand Indian with which you thpnk it would bo possible to carryon during next financial year provided general conditionsdo not appreciably deteriorate, and what further reductionscan be made each succeeding year0     You need not be afraid that you will bo held Irrevocably to your estimate howevercircumstances may alter.     I shall at all times do my best to see that your requirements a-a properly supplied,    Butit is essential that I should be able to state at present justice what is absolute minimum of military force requiredfor Mesopotamia supposing all goes well and you are in com-plete civil and military control., he, minimum without vdiiohit would be useless for us to stay in the country or perseverewith policy of nursing Arab Stats through its non-age.     would it be possible to concentrate for the present and re-establishour position in outlying districts as the native army developsi,      Mesopotamia

LAND SETTLE- With reference to Cabinet 78 (20), Conclusion 5,MENT OF EX-SERVICE -MEN       the Prime Minister explained that he wished to see theD(pC0TLAND.officials concerned with the administration of Land Settle-ment In Scotland, for the purpose of exploring thepossibility of hastening the fulfilment of the pledgesthat had been given to men who had volunteered in the war that thoy would be settled on the land on their return.It was pointed out that even If the proposals Inthe Land Settlement Committee&apos;s Report were adopted, only ,000 out of a waiting list cf 5,000 ex-Service applicantswould be given land, and It was impossible to ask theremainder to wait indefinitely.The first proposal discussed was a grant of lend on&quot;prairie&quot; t^rms, with a small money grant.      It was ex-plained that this had already been attempted, but the response wag practically nil, the men had nowhere to live,,and the minimum expenditure possible was  500 for awooden heus&quot; and steading with a further grant of  500for building a proper house, the total cost includingfencing, water and equipment being  1,300 on a holding of40 to 50 acres, the size of the average holding.      Incertain districts 10 acres were regarded as feasible forintensive cultivation, but there was nothing between10 and 40 acres.     On the other hand, in England and wales the average siad was 13 acres, holdings varying from 2 or3 acres to 30 acres, or even 50 acres.     With  1,300 forbuildings and equipment, and  650 for land, the averagecapital cost for each holding was  2,000, and the return,in the form of rent, would be only 2 per cent, while theGovernment fould not borrow at less than 6-g per cent,with an additional ^ per cent for sinking-fund.The Prime Minister wsb of opinion that such asystem was bad and&apos;-an.econeraicm It was so slow that itcould not have any appreciable effect en the characterof the population, it involved a dead loss to thecommunity, and was of a very speculative nature.
Tie siiyyjested that the Belgian system of holdings of from  to 5 acres,, worked by men v;hc were engagedIn other occupations, some of them working in the towns, wouldbo quicker and more satisfactory.      It was no use reducing expenditure on the present system;    they must devise someother system involving more modest proposals and settling alarger number of people, in order to get valuo for their money.The Chancellor cf tho Exchequer pointed out that the government would have groat difficulty in facing a comparison between the expenditure on land settlement in England and scotland, If Scotland, already having had nearly the wholeof its proportionate share according to population, were totake a   largely increased share, and   if at the same time theexpenditure per holding In Scotland were so much higher,The Secretary for Scotland stated that tho pledges given   were not territorial but absolute, and that anar*:ii^ont   based on   tho   usual      prorortion did not apply.80&quot;He stated   that the history of land settlement in Scotland was quite different   from, that in England the holding of50 acres or thereby dating back   as far as   1886.     It wouldbo extremely difficult to break off   a system to which thepeople had become   accustomed.     Already the position, wasmenacing, and there had been frequent end extensive raids.Reference was also made to the Danish system, which hadbeen very   successful..    It was. contended that the naturalconditions in Denmark wore analogous to those.in Scotland,and that an effort should   be   made to   concentrate settlement in Scotland In the neighbourhood of the towns, where, owingto tho proximity of - a market, intensive cultivation waspossible.Sir Robert Greig stated  t hat the only wry in which itwould bo possible   to Impose a system of holdings of smallsizd would be to offer holdings of 10 acres on condition that the   applicant5s name would be removed from the listif the offer were not accepted.
It mi agreedThat the Secretary- for Scotland should confer with the officials of the scottish office,and endeavour to devise a systembetter adapted, on the one hand, to theneed-for acceleration, and, on the other,to the difficulty of incurring large capital expenditure in present financial conditions, and that the natter should.befurther.discussed with the Prime minister on tho following Tuesday, Jenuary 4th, 1901.2, tfhitehall, Gardens   S.W.4th January^ 1921 *
