(1) In continuation of the discussion begun at their morning meeting (Cabinet 69 (20) , Conclusion 5), the Cabinet heard the views of Sir Arnold Wilson in ?egard to our policy in Mesopotamia as affected by Military considerations.

Sir Arnold Wilson considered that the proposal to retire to a line covering Basra and the Anglo-Persian Oilfields would cost almost as much as th? retention of Mosul and Bagh-? since these regions would very soon come under definitely hostile influences. The tribue in the Basra region were closely connected with those in the Baghdad and Mosul villayets. Consequently, th? situation would he reproduced which we encountered in 1915, when the Turks threatened our flank at Shaiba and very  nearly succeeded in ejecting us. Our difficulties  arose largely from the great length and vulnerability of our communications. On the Tigris these had never been seriously threatened, owing to the memory of the crushing defeats of Turks and Arabs inflicted by General  Maude. our main difficulties had been encountered on tho Euphrates, where neither our armies nor, for that matter, the Turks had ever operated. Asked as to the policy he would recommend should financial considerations preclude the continued occupation of Baghdad and Mosul, Sir Arnold ?ilson advised a withdrawal. In the first instance he would retire to the Amara - Nasiriyah  line covering Basra and the Persian oilfields. He strongly advocated dredging the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab to 30 ft., in order to admit large warships and merchant ships, thus rend ring possible the co-operation of the Navy as far as Kurna.  Lord Incheape and Sir Charles Gr enway

had already promised to undertake this work, subject  to certain guarantees.

Sir Arnold Wilson was then asked  whether it would not be possible to adopt a course similar to that taken for the protection of the Persian Oil fields, which had been accomplished  by payments to the Bakhtiari tribe.    He explained that the conditions were, different. The Bakhtiari had a


certain traditional attachment to the central Persia- Govern-i:,entr. but the tribes of R-sopotahia --re actuated by no cor-resooodr rjr allegiance to any central authority..&apos;  The inhabi-tants of hosopotamia, Sir Arnold   -ilson stated, unfortunatelyshowed ho strong feeling in favour of   n Arab Government.    he himself, rather as a last resort, had advised a trial of the emir Peisal for the purpose or forming   n Arab Government.The difficulty was that Peisal was not only a Sunni but afor-el-neri    ^he Sunnia, though forming only one-third of theArab population, the remainder b^-ing Shiahe, constituted thewest vigorous and advanced elements, but it was doubtful if- the Emir Peisal world secure the support of the Kurds, whowere Sunnis and numbered about 400,COO in the mandatory area.On the whole, Sir Arnold Wilson considered that the populationo* Mesopotamia preferred British to Turkish administration,but they would prefer the latter to the chaos which would inevitably supervene in this area if neither British nor Turkswere in control.The Cabinet gen-rally felt that the r.^-establishmentof Turkish, rule would be a most deplorable sequel to our great and successful campaign in this area.In Sir Arnold ^ilson&apos;s view, the proposed withdrawal tothe line covering Basra (where th&quot;  population desired a continuance cr British administration), and the Persian Oil- ifields, would have a disastrous effect on our position asmandatory, and we should at once lose all authority in theevacuated ro/?ions.    We could only recover this position bymeans of a f-wwfh expedition on the same scale as before,meanwhile, our national honour would have Suffer d irreparabledamage by our failure to keep our word.In r-- ply to a question as to whether,  from a materialpoint of view, it was in the interests of the British empirethat the ^rit^sh taxpayer should continue to pay the enormousprice involved in holding on to the whole ar-a of Mesopotar ia.Sir Arnold   -ilson replied in the affirmative,- He e-plained
that hs took ;th13 view because of the immense undevelopedpotentialities of Mesopotamia in raw materials, moreespecially cotton, oil and cereals.   Mesopotamia would beable to support the burden of the debt incurred in retain-ing it, if the oil provesd a success.    Otherwise, not.    Hesubsequently added that its retention presented greatimportance from the point of view of our prestige in theEast.    Its evacuation would increase our difficulties inIndia and Egypt,  and would not be helpful to Australia,which could not view with equanimity any weakening of theBritish position in the region of Asia, through and acrosswhich our eastward communications by sea and by land mustpas s.It was suggested, however; that the experience ofthe War, and particularly the evacuation of Gallipoli, hadshowr the forecasts of the best-informed people to be wrongas regards the less of prestige consequent on a withdrawal.Sir Arnold   -ilson informed the Cabinet that service inMesopotamia was not unpopular among Indian troops.    He hadbeen assured by Sir //; Marshall,  at Foona, that there were three volunteers for every vacancyiThe apparent inconsistency of this with recent tele-grams from India was explained by the Secretary of State forIndia.    Service in Mesopotamia was net unpopular to the-indTvidual:   what &quot;-as unpopular in India amongst .Indianpoliticians was the use ef the Indian Army in Mesopotamia..Sir Arnold Tilson commented that the Mohammedans ofIndia desired the return of the Turks.Asked as to what he would do if he were required, as chief Representative of His MajestyTs Government, to runMesopotamia on a military expenditure of  10,000,000 a year,Sir Arnold    ilson said he would devote 07,000,000 to Britishand Indian troops,  3,000,003 to Arab levies and similar for-cbs.    and retire forthwith to the line Anara - Nasiriyah.Eventually he thought he would be forced back to the line
Anapa - Eurna, if not to toa, as it was in has viewinevitable that Baghdad,.-.once evacuated by us, should fall into the hands of a Power hostile to us,    Basra would become.eeMesopotamia irredenta. ,. .equestioned as to why the murks, after all theircatastrophic debate and after losing a great proportion oftheir armament, should still be eo formidable as to be ableto force us to recede in this manner, Sir Arnold Wilsonstated that nearly all the persons capable of serving asofficials were of Turkish nationality.    It was very difficultto find sufficient Arab officials, although posts had been offered to practically all educated Arabs.    In reply tofurther questions he explained that he v/as assuming a con-nee t ion between Turkey and Bolshevist Russia.    lie did notthink that the Turks, in the event of their return, wouldrevenge themselves to any great extent on those inhabitantswho had been associated with British rule, as the latter hadusually been careful to keep in with both sides.Sir Arnold Wilson stated that a plebiscite was shortly to be held for the election of representatives,  to be chosenunder an electoral law which had been ready when he leftMesopotamia.    The electors, however, would, he judged froeprevious experience, be intimidated by extremists.He thought that, if ordered now, a year would berequired for the evacuation of Mesopotamia.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff made a roughcalculation, to the effect th&amp;t a withdrawal, if orderednow and begun in April, would occupy at least until Septem-beig    He anticipated that,  in order to prevent a disasterin withdrawing, it might be necessary to retain the rein-foreements sent from&apos; India during the   recent rebellion..The military authorities required/as much notice as possi-ble in the event of withdrawal.-   It might prove a dangerous and delicate -operation, and should be kept secret as longas possible.    He estimated the force to hold the
Naairiyah - Amara - Ah&apos;.?a2 line at one Division, costing very&apos;approximately  8,000,000 a year.Sir Arnold    ilson was clear that, even if friendly relations were established with the Turks,  it would, not bepossible to hold the area at present occupied at a cost of 10,000,.000 a year of military expenditure.An important point arising out of Si?&apos; Arnold  -ilson&apos;sr^-arks, which were to some extent confirmed by informationrecently received by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,was that, in favourable circumstances, it might be possibleto withdraw our forces from North-west Persia without waiting for the Spring.(Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson.  Sir ArnoldrZilspn. and General Cobbe then withdrew.)The Cabinet agreed  (a) That it was not possible, without furtherconsideration,., to reach a decision on theyGovernment&apos;a future policy in Mesopotamia:(b) That the Secretary of State for War, inthe Debate on the Ar y Supplementary Es-timates on December 15ths should resistdemands for any declaration of policybeyond that which had been already made.(2) With reference to Cabinet 68 (20), Conclusion 2, theCabinet discussed further developments arising out of the tentative overtures by Sinn Fein.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that on saturday, December 11th, he had seen Archbishop Glume, whobad laid down certain conditions on which he would go toIreland and discuss matters with certain Sinn Fein leaders.The Prime Minister had toll  him to impress on the Sinn Feinersthat it was useless for them to hope to achieve their objectby force.   A telegram had now been received from the IrishGovernment to.the effect that the result of the Archbishop&apos; a conversation with Mr Arthur Griffith and Mr John MacHeill wasthat they considered a month&apos;s truce to be absolutely essential.
A telegram was&apos; read from Father 0&apos;Flanagan in the sense that before goinr; farther he xiust have facilities tocommunicate with Mr de Yalera and Mr Arthur Griffith,  endingWith an appeal for a seasonable abatement of rutual anirosltv.It was explained that no difficulty would be imposed on Father     Flanagan seeing Mr Arthur Griffith   or in cablingto Mr de Yalera, though there ms general agreement that thelatter, who had publicly approved the recent murders in Dublinshould not be permitted to return to this country.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) &quot;&quot;gnat a reply should b--- sent to Father0&apos;Flanagan that the cables were open and there was nothing to prevent himc off-muni eating by cable. Ho obstaclewould be raised to Father 0&apos;Flanagancommunicating with Mr Arthur Griffith:(b) That the drafting of the letter shouldbe left to the Prime Minister and theChief Secretary for Ireland:(c) That Sir John Anderson should give a-verbal reply to Archbishop Clune, In. the sense o^ the following al.de-memorandum.ue,which contained the substance of thePrime Minister&apos;s verbal remarks to the archbishop:-(1) All arms, ammunition, uniforr:isexplosives,  in area under martial law to be surrendered to the Gov-. ernment.(2)  All arms in rest of Ireland to be handed over to safe custody of Gov-ernment, no distinction to be madebete-pen rest of Ireland and Ulster.   ,(3) Sinn Fein to order cessation of allviolence.    So-called reprisals, etc,would stop automatically if n-u deeand arson and outrages ceased.    Ho.executions to take place withouttrial by Court Martial.(4) Sinn Fein Members of Parliament(except specified list) to beallowed to assemble.(S) With reference to Cabinet 69  (20), Conclusion 5, theSecretary of State for v,ar stated that, he had found, afterconsultation with the Surveyor-eensral of Supply, &apos; that there-were important objections to putting in force the Cabinet Con-elusion with regard to short time at   oolwich   objections which did not apply in the same degree to other national factories,    He therefore proposed to raise the matter again at the Cabinet, -6-

i/ith reference to Conclusion 10 of a Conference ofMinisters held on November 25,  1920, the Conference hudbefore them the First and Second Reports *of the Emergency Committee (Papers CP.-2167 and CP. 2183 respoctively).In the Second Report it was stated that, when consideringthe question of the protection of the Houses of Parliament^the Police Authorities said that they couM not guarantee the absolute protection of the Chambers in both Housesunless the public was exeludod from all the galleries, withthe exception of the Ambassadors.&apos;-; Distinguished Strangers1and Special Galleries.    Short of this someiehat drastic steptho following alternative precautions were suggested:-fa) The searching of all persons admitted to Public Galleries and Committee Rooms:f b) To exclude all women from the products of the IIou.ee.. and to &amp;dmit men only tothe Public Galleries *The Police stated.that the searching of women presented great difficulties, a rid unless the search was . thorough it would be useless, and a thorough search would entail great inconve-nienoe to the individuals concerned.:    Tho Police authorities were in favour of closing the Galleries altogether.The general feeling of the Conference was that itwould, be very unsafe to keep the Galleries open, owing tothe impossibility of guaranteeing the safety of Members.The Conference were informed that the recent outragesat Liverpool and the attempt at 1&apos;insbury showed that the sinn Peiners had definitely decided to carry their war ofoutrage inte England../-that the Sinn Peiners were known tobe manufacturing bombs,  and, further,, that during theCoal Strike 30,000 detonators were stolen in Scotland,The Conference agreed  That the Speaker should, make an announcement in the following terms that afternoon-&quot;After consultation with the ChiefComivssioner of Police, I am s&amp;tis-fiod that it is desirable to closeall Galleries to which the public have access.
Tho Secretary of State for foreign affairs undertook to communicate with the LordGreat Chamberlain regarding similar pre-cautions to be taken in the Hou-:e of Lords.Whlteb a 11 Gp r dens, B. \y. l.November 29, 1920*

From internal evidence it was clear that the disclosures had been obtained from French sources.

It was generally agreed that there was no particular objection in approaching the "Daily Telegraph" on the subject. If one newspaper refused to act on such revelations, another and less friendly or discreet newspaper would do so.

The Conference agreed :-

(a) That the question should be raised at the re-assembly of the Conference next Thursday;

(b) That Lord Curzon should use his discretion to speak to the French Ambassador on the subject.

2 3 u(1) With reference to Cabinet 59 (20), -Appendix V (S),the Conference bad before them&quot; two documents on the subjectof Armenian-(i) A telegram from If, Eymans. the Presidentcf the Council of the League of nations,ashing whether the British Government 4would be d&quot;isposed, either alone or con-jointly with other nations,  to undertakeen behalf of the League of Nations the humanitarian mission of stepping hostill-ties between Arcenia and the Eenialists(Paper 0.F.-219S):(ii) A telegram from Mr Fisher, from Geneva,stating that E, Viviani and Lord robert cecil were attempting to rush Armenia intothe League of Nations,, that he ana mr balfour doubt-d tho advisability of this;but that, when the question was consideredby the Assembly, the admission of Armeniamight be carried by nations which wou&amp;dhot raise a finger to assist the cause ofArmenia.in regard to (i) the Conference were informed that president Wilson was reported in the Press to have acceptedthe invitation of the Council to mediate between Armeniaand the. Eemalists, on the understanding that there was noquestion of utilising American forces.    Spain and Brazilwere reported to have made friendly but non-committalreplies.It was pointed out that events were moving rapidly in these regions, and that Armenia., with scant resources,with little apparent capacity to defend herself and almostcut off from the outside world, was ground between theTurkish Nationalists and the Bolshevist Russians, whotb^sel^es appe?r-d to be rapidly drifting into a stateof hostilities.    In/these circumstances Armenia wouldprobably make her own terns, or have terms forced on her.It was generally felt that. in view of our immensepreoccupations elsewhere, it would not be desirable forGreat Britain to volunteer to undertake this intervention. .In regard to the admission of Armenia to the Leagueof Nations, it-was-pointed out that admission hud been refused to other nations, such as the Baltic States,which were in many respects better qualified than Armenia  &apos;
for admission.   The admission of other Trana-OaucasianStates had been refused on the ground that their houndailetwere as yet unsettled.   Yet the Armenian boundaries1   pendlrPresident Wilson&apos;s decision, mere still undefined.    It was further pointed out that the admission of Armenia to theLeague would, under Article 10 of the Covenant,  involve anundertaking to respect and preserve as against external aggression its territorial integrity and existing political independence.   Undertaking obligations that it would be incapable of fulfilling would weaken the League.while the Conference generally agreed with Mr Balfouand Mr Fisher that it was undesirable for Armenia to be ad-mltted to the League, it was felt, equally strongly, thatfor the British Government to adopt an isolated attitude of opposition, when other nations were unanimously in favour oadmission, would create a very disagreeable position from apolitical point of view.After considerable discussion, the Conference agreed(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should prepare a telegram, to besent by the Prime Minister to the Presidentof the Council of the League of Nations,observing that the President of the UnitedStates has expressed his willingness to mediate with a view to ending hostilities,and pointing out that we are not clear asto the extent to which the Armenians mayhave anticipated this action by negotiating with the Turks or theEolsheviks,    In any ( ,case, His Eajesty&apos; s Government inferrable toaccept any independent Mission, but will give every moral and diplomatic support to anyefforts made by President Wilson:(b) &quot;That the question of the admission of Armeniato the League of Nations should be raised that afternoon at the Conference with the Frenchand Italian Governments.
(2)    The Chancellor of tho Exchequer stated that alittle time ago a letter had been received from corralLance ehire Authorities asking that the Ministry ofHealth ard the Prime Minister should receive aDeputation regarding Old Age Pensions.     Owing to an unfortunate mistake in the Treasury, the request hadbeen refused without consultation with the Prime.Minister or himself.     This ref.-ly had somewhatirritated those   responsible for asking that theDeputation might be received,,     The Chancellor of theExchequer added that he was prepared to receive theDeputation if pressed, but chat he proposed, if the cabinet agreed, to refuse their proposal; which wasthat Old Age Pensions should be paid to everyone on reaching the age of 70*The Conference concurred in the reply theChancellor of the Exchequer proposed to make.
(3)With reference to Cabinet 63 (20),ece AwD   .DDF&apos;- EASTERN     Conclusion 1, the Conference had before them thefollowing documents dealing with the question of theGovernment&apos;s foreign policy in the Middle Easts -Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (Paper C.P*-2165).memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper C P0-2193)Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign andPolitical Department;  dated November 23rd,1920,  (Paper CP.-2164).Telegram from Viceroy^ dated November- 2nd,1920 (Paper CPa-2209)memorandum by the Secretary cf Stste forIndia (Paper C*P,-2210)oIt was argued that it was Impossible to maintain?ur&apos; present position except on a basis of friendly relations with Turkeys,     Owing to the expense andother difficulties connected with&apos;both white and indian trosps,  it could not be contemplated that theywould be maintained at their present strength for a prolonged period.     An &quot;opportunity has now arisen, owingto the results of the Greek elections, for us to lightenour- burdens in the Middle East by arriving at under-stendings with the Turks and making the conditions ofthe Treaty of Sevres less heavy on theme     As a resultof our policy in this part of the world, an unnatural&apos;Alliance had sprung up between the Turks and theBolsheviksjj though there were now signs of its breaking,and the question prose now as to which side the BritishGovernment should lean...A considerable measure of agreement was expressed with the view that the possibility of handing backSmyrna to the uncontrolled rule of the Turks by theAllies could not be entertained,, though there was somesympathy expressed with the suggestion that it might -be turned into an autonomous area under the suzeraintyof the Turks.
It was generally agreed that the question would haveto he reviewed in the event of the Greeks failing ts maintain their position in that area.     This led to the point as tothe desirability of making a revision now of the Treaty of sevres, or of waiting until such time as certain clauses Ofthe Treaty were not carried Into effect or for any reasonbroke down.     &apos;xhe advantages of entering Into direct negotia--tions with Mustapha    Kbmal were discussed,-  and the conference were informed of steps which were being taken at Constanti-nople, and which met with general approval.     On the otherhand, strong -emphasis was laid on the fact that the treaty with Turkey had been signed by the Allies, Italy in facthaving ratified It, and that the Turks were being pressed todo so.     Within the next two years the Tre&amp;ty might breakdown at some point owing to the new situation in Greece, andit would be preferable to await -events rather than to initiatea revision of the Treaty at the present moment,     Also, toundertake now the task of revising the Treaty would involvea re-opening of a number of difficult questions, which forthe present at any rate had been adjusted.The trend of the discussion showed general agreementwith the following conclusion t-That His- Majesty&apos;s Government should ccn-tinue to press the Turks to ratify the Treaty   ,of Sevres,  and should resist attempts to modify the Treaty directly and at once,     In the eventof the subsequent non--fulfilment of certainterms of the Treaty, the opportunity should betaken to reconsider the situation which wouldthen arise, In a light more favourable to turkey.Note by the Secretary/

2 o g.   GREECE AND MIDDLE EASTERN POLICY.Note by tho Secretary of State for War regardingConclusion (5) of the Conclusions of a Conferenceof Ministers held on Thursday. 2nd December, 1920.I consider that tho account of the discussion on this subject does not fairly represent the opinions expressed.     I stated my own views and those of theGeneral Staff, but I thought, that they were in themain in accordance with those of the Lord Privy Seal,the Chancellor ef the Exchequer and the secretaries of State for India and the Colonies.     Those views were that we should make a definite change in our policy in the direction ef procuring a real peace withthe Moslem world and so relieving ourselves of the disastrous reaction both military and financial towhich our anti-Turk policy has exposed us In the SdddleEast and in Indian     However,, speaking only for myself,I repudiate the suggestion in the third paragraph that&quot;there was unanimous agreement with the view that thepossibility of handing back Smyrna to the Turks by theAllies could not be entertained&quot;,.        On the contrary,   ,1 am convinced- that the restoration of Turkish sovereigntyor suzerainty over the Smyrna Province is an indispensablestep to the pacification of the Middle East.      It isquite true that like others I hold that effectiveadministrative protection must be secured to the christian population; and I am sure that there are several ways in which this could be afforded withoutdepriving the Turks of their Suzerainty.     The statement in the Report that &quot;there was some sympathy expressed with the suggestion that it might be turned into an autonomous area&quot; is not to raj&quot; recollection borne outby the facts.      I do not remember anyone suggestingthis solution for Smyrna, though it was mentioned inregard, to Thrace *
E 3 ?With regard to the Treaty of Sevres,  I certainlythought the general opinion was that this instrumentwould have to he modified, hut that it might be better to modify it by an amending instrument rather than byabandoning the Treaty.     The discussion on this point was unhappily vep3&apos;&quot; much curtailed0The sentence &quot;It was felt that sooner or laterit might possibly be desirable to enter into directxnegotiations with Mustapha Kernel&apos;1 Is.  in my opinion,a complete understatement of the general view.     ThePrime Minister himself said he was in favour of entering into negotiations with Mustapha Kemal, and the foreign secretary declared that efforts were how actually beingmade to open such negotiations.     Certainly the general conclusion ?ras that they were necessary and desirable,It would appear to be very injurious that such anincomplete account should be circulated to Members ofthe Cabinet .r.ho did not hear the discussion^ and Irequest that this Memorandum may be sent to any ministers who have received It,s(Intd) WoSoC.ICth December, 1920,2cThe original draft has been amended in this respect,(Intd) MuPcAeH.11=12,20.

Hodrew particular attention to the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War, CP. 2203, setting forth the probability that the French would mahe more ready use than His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of the reciprocal freedom for the employment oftroops raised in their Mandatory area, and pointing outthat a French column was at the present moment on the move to Beir-es-nor, and that the French Administration in Syriawas shoeing indications of interference on the Eorth-Eastfrontier of Palestine.After a short, discussion, the Conference agreedthat these considerations did not introduce any new factor which had not been before the Cabinet when it dis-cussed the question, and that the previous decision of theCabinet should be up-held.     They felt that it would boinexpedient for the British Government to tie its hands asregards the possible raising of troops in the Mandatedareas for some great national emergency, which might arise in the future, if the Mandated. Governments should consent.Moreover, as the French had already put in&apos;their Mandate tothe league of Rations we should be placed at a disadvantageif our Mandate did not include the same privileges in thisrespect,
The Conference agreedThat the Secretary of State for Foreignif fairs should authorise Mr. Balfour tocommunicate the revised Mandates for mesopotamia and Palestine to the Leagueof Nations.j^lhitehall gardens,3rd December, 19SO.

2Electricity Supply 1. With reference to H.A.C.-78, Conclusion 2, the Committed(No. 2) Bill. jia(j Defore them a note by the Secretary to the Cabinet covering a revised draft Ball to deal with the supply of electricity (C.P.-2163).The question was raised whether it was necessary to introduce this bill in view of the congestion of Parliamentary business and theopposition to measures which seemed likely to extend the borrowing&apos;powers of public bodies. It was, however, explained to theCommittee that the Government had undertaken to introduce a newElectricity Supply Bill which would contain the provisions deletedby the House of Lords from the Act of 1919. Such a Bill had been introduced earlier in the session, but owing to the great oppositionto some of its provisions it had not been proceeded with. Thepresent Bill was considered to be almost non-controversial. It wasshorter than the previous Bill, and was designed to give the ElectricityCommissioners essential powers to enable them to undertake their work of establishing Joint Electricity Authorities.It was pointed out to the Committee that the House ofCommons was much more critical at the present time of financial proposals than it was a year ago, but the Committee were assured that the present Bill involved no charge on the public funds, andthat its financial provisions were mainly confined to giving theElectricity Commissioners power to authorise the Joint Electricity-Authorities to borrow. Without these powers the Joint electricity authorities would be unable to function. It was urged that, while there seemed to be no chance of passing the Bill through Parlia-ment before Christmas, the Bill should be introduced and printedas soon as possible. Electrical undertakers complained that the firstBill which had been introduced earlier in the session was still hanging-over their heads. They feared its compulsory powers, and theintroduction of the present Bill, which did not contain such powers,would reassure municipalities. It was, therefore, necessary that thepresent Bill should be introduced immediately in order to allayhostility.The Committee agreed To sanction the introduction into Parliament of theElectricity (Supply) (No. 2; Bill (C.P.-2163), subject to the amendments referred to in the subsequent minutes beingmade in it.The Committee then proceeded to consider the Bill clause by clause.Clause 1. This clause represents Clause 12 of the Electricity(Supply) (No. 1) Bill in a somewhat altered form, and has beenagreed with the Treasury.The Committee agreed To approve Clause 1 of the Bill.Clause 2. It was explained that this clause, which relates tothe postponement of sinking funds, affected only new- works and did not involve the postponement of existing sinking funds. Theclause had been approved by the Treasury and the Ministry of Health.The Committee agreed That Clause 2 should be redrafted so as to make it clearthat the clause referred to newr works, and did not enable anysinking fund established under the Acts of 1882 to 1919 beforethe passing of the Bill toabe suspended.Clause 3. The Committee approved this clause as drafted.Clause 4. It was explained to the Committee that this clausewas entirely permissive and was designed to enable the constituentbodies of a Joint Electricity Authority to lend money and give other financial assistance to the Authority. It was maintained that suchconstituent bodies could very often raise money more cheaply thanthe Association itself could.
With regard to sub-section 2, lines 26 to 29 of the clause, itwas suggested that the precedent in the Act of 1909 (Section 21)should be specifically referred to.The Committee agreed That with the above amendment Clause   4  should beaccepted.Clause 5. It was explained to the Committee that this clausewas new. Section 29 of the Act of 1919 provided that theElectricity Commissioners should apportion the excess of estimatedexpense in each financial year over estimated receipts among thejoint electricity authorities and authorised undertakers within theUnited Kingdom, the object being to throw the cost of the ElectricityCommission on the undertakers. The section provided, however,that during the first two years after the passing of the Act the excess should be paid out of public funds, and repaid subsequentlywith interest to the Treasury by equal annual instalments. Sub-section (1) of Clause 5 of the present Bill was designed to make clear what exactly was meant by the period of two years. Theclause had been approved by the Treasury.The Committee agreed to approve Clause 5 as drafted.Clauses G, 7, 8 and 9. The Committee were informed that these clauses were old and did not require fresh consideration.Clause 1.0- This clause is an extension of Clause 22 of theprincipal Act which deals with wayieaves. The present clause is designed to, secure the right of wayieaves to retain existing electriclines subject to the conditions of Section 22 of the principal Act.Clauses 11 and 12. The Committee were informed that these were old clauses.Clause 13. This clause provides that over a term of years to be approved by the Electricity Commissioners the prices charged for electricity shall be such as to render the Authority supporting.The Committee agreed to accept Clause 13.Clause 14. This clause enables the maximum prices to be revisedat intervals of three years instead of five years, as required by&quot; The Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act, 1899.&quot;The Committee agreed to accept Clause 14, subject to thesubstitution of the phrase &quot; mutatis mutandis &quot; for the phrase&quot; subject to the necessary modifications.&quot;Clause 15. The opinion was expressed that it would be undesirable at so early a date to alter the provisions of the principalAct in regard to enquiries.The Committee agreed that Clause 15 should be deletedfrom the Bill.Clause 16. It was explained to the Committee that Section 18of the principal Act gives to the Ministry of Transport power toconstruct interim works pending the establishment of Joint electricity authorities. Clause 16 of the present Bill fixed&apos;the time duringwhich payment for such works would have to be made by the joint electricity Authorities. The clause was particularly desired by the yorkshire authorities.The Committee agreed to sanction Clause 16.Clause 17. It was explained to the Committee that this clauseenabled surplus supplies of electricity generated by railway or tram
companies to be used for commercial purposes when such supplies would not compete with those of statutory undertakers. ( jThe Committee agreed to approve Clause 17.Clause 18. The Committee considered that this clause as draftedwas ambiguous, and might be held to preclude companies from payingsubscriptious to the funds of electrical associations.The Committee agreed that Clause 18 should be deletedfrom the Bill.Glauses 19-24. The Committee approved these clauses as drafted.Postage on Lettersof Soldiers and sailors serving abroad.   (C.P.-2114.)2. With reference to Conclusion 3 of a conference of ministers held on the 21st July, 1920, the Committee had uuder consideration a Memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C.P.-2114) regardingthe postage of letters of soldiers and sailors serving abroad. Inthis Memorandum it was suggested that members of the forces inBritish dominions and possessions should pay the ordinary civilianrate for letters to this country.The Committee agreed (1.) That members of the forces serving in British dominionsand possessions should pay the ordinary civilian rate forletters to this country.(2.) That no special arrangement should be made to establish adifferent rate for heavier letters posted by sailors.Police pensions bill.   (CP.-2137.)3. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (C.P.-2137) covering a Draft Bill to consolidate the law relating to Police Pensions in England, Scotland and Wales,and to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee on police Service presided over by Lord Desborough. The main recommendations of the Committee were that standard pensionscales should be fixed for all police forces in Great Britain in lieu of&quot;the variety of scales at present existing and the different and less favourable scales prescribed for the Scottish police. Under the new scale the period of service to qualify for maximum pension would befixed at thirty years as against twenty-six years for England andWales and thirty-four years for Scotland. The Bill also provides fora new scale of pensions for men injured on duty and a slight increaseof widows&apos; pensions.It was considered that the Bill would allay agitation in theScottish police, who are pressing for the immediate adoption of the pension scales recommended by the Desborough Committee. It was explained that there were certain matters of detail in the Billregarding which it would be desirable that the Treasury, the IrishTreasury and the Irish Office should be consulted.The Committee agreed To sanction the introduction of the Police Pensions Bill(C.P.-2137) into Parliament, subject to prior agreement being reached between the Home Office, the Treasury, the IrishTreasury and the Irish Office about certain matters of detail.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 30, 1920.o
