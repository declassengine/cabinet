1. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the situation.in Greece, arising out of the decisive defeat of M. Venizelosst the polls, and the consequent possibility of s return efpossibleSiny Constentine.     The/reaction   of this situation on theTurkish Treaty, which is still unratified, was recognised tobe very important, end the Cabinet generally felt that it war:of great importance that Great Britain and prance shouldconcert their policy in this matter.     The Cabinet were inform-ed that M. Berthelot might be coming to London shortly, endthst M. Leygues, the Preach prime Minister, had expressed his willingness tc come to London in ten days or so.While recognising that the question could not be properly discussed in the absence (through indisposition) ofthe Secretary of Stste for Foreign Affairs, the Cabinetgenerally agreed  Thst occasion should be taken to concert our policy with the Prench Government within a shorter space of time than ten days.      Theyleft to the Prime Minister and the Secretaryof Stste for Foreign Affairs full discretion to make such arrangements as they might thinkbest for concerting our policy with the FrenchCove rumen t.
&quot;SHIPPING 3.       In the sbsence^of&quot; the President of the Board ofSBPABAtTOFS^&quot;&quot;&apos; &quot;Trade v Minister of Labour and Shipping-Controller, theCabinet, after a preliminary discussion, found it&quot;.   impossible to reach a decision on the subject of Shipping&apos;Peperations.fTHE DIYOKCS   2.     TE3 lord CHABGBLLOK drew the attention of the Cabinetto the importance of pushing on, as soon as possible, withthe Divorce Bill in tho House of Commons.     The House ofLords had devoted no less than three weeks to this measure,which had been based or. the report of   ft   Royal commission appointed several years ago on Mr.Asquith&apos;s advice.madeThe proposal was/that certain portions of the bill now before the House of Commons, which were practicallynon-contentious, might be passed into law without further delay.In view of the feet that several important measureshad had to bo dropped on the ground that it had not beenSeemed right to ask Parliament in an Autumn Session to dealwith any business that was not practically essential, theCabinet felt that it would be inadvisable to proceed withthe Divorce Bill this session.The Lord Chancellor undertook to communicate this decision to Members of the House of Lordswho were pressing for the Bill to be proceeded with.
POLAND.

Despatch of Stores and Supply of Clothing.

(4) With reference to Cabinet 52 (20) Conclusion 6, the Cabinet had before them Memoranda furnished by the War Office on the following subjects:-

The Despatch cf Certain Military Stores to Poland (C.P.1866):

The Supply of Clothing and Boots to Poland (C.P.1868):

In the former Memorandum the General Staff recommended that Polish shipping agents should be permitted to remove the residue of certain stores, equipment and munitions, which had been granted to Poland as a free gift.

In the latter the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had urged that Cabinet approval should be given to the principle of supplying to Poland on payment through the French authorities such items of clothing and equipment as we can spare.

Having regard to the complete change in the situation in Poland since the original gift was made, and since the Memoranda were written, and having regard, more particularly, to the dubious incident of the occupation of Vilna by Polish troops under General Zeligowski, the Cabinet agreed -

(a) In regard to the gift that the polish authorities should not be permitted to remove the stores for the present, though the Army Council should be at liberty to raise the question again should they think fit after the situation at Vilna has been satisfactorily cleared up:

(b) The Polish Government should be permitted to purchase spare British Stores from the British Government on the distinct understanding that the transaction is carried out on purely commercial lines, and that they pay cash. They should also be permitted to purchase through commercial houses.
T3FUSBERGEN. (6)   With reference to War Cabinet 441, Minute 9, Sir&quot;Lamington Worthixigtnn Evans reported to the Cabinet that hehad been, informed that Herr Hugo Stinnes &quot;ras endeavouring to buy the coal and other deposits in Spitzbergen, which wereunderstood to he not only of v-ry considerable value butalso easily accessible.    He was Informed that a Britishgroup was prepared to forestall Herr Stinnes if they weregiven an indication that the Government considered thisdesirable from a national point of view-The Cabinet were reminded that an opportunity had arisen during the War for acquiring properties in Spitzber-gen practically free of cost, but that the matter had notbeen followed up.The Cabinet agreed  -   To authorise the President of the Boardof Trade to inform the British group con-c era 3d that the Government would regard the acquisition by a British commercialgroup of mining rights in Spitzbergenas advantageous from a national point ofview. BISHOPi ii X -a tf 5T^1 t&amp;L-jr e forenc e to. Cabinet 44, (20), Conclusion 1, tho Gab-Inot had before then a latter.from Mr. Adam son, Chairman of theLabour Party, addressed to the prime Minister, in which he urged that the Government should reconsider their decision to forbid Xrchhishop Hannir to visit Ireland3   and a Memo, by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty    (CP. 087).The Cabinet were of or-in ion that, at tho present time,while tho campaign of murder in Ireland was still continuing,it would not bo in the public interest to permit frchbiehepMannis to&apos; visit Ireland, although it might be possible to re-consider this decision after tho Home Pule Bill had boon passed into law, If the murder campaign by that time should have ceased.It was agreed  That the reply to Mr.  damson should be intho sense that the Government wore unableto reconsider their policy,
(?) With, reference to Cabinet 2 (20), Minute 3,  the cabinet had before thorn a Memorandum by the Chancellor of tho Exchequer,rocomraending the   abolition of the Supreme Economic Council( CP,-2108).Tho Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that as tho re-salt of the British Government1 s attitude no meetings of thoSupreme Economic Council had taken place for several months,and the business of tho Council had beon conducted by an Sxecu-tive Committoo.    The League of Nations had now appointed aCommission to consider its own economic organisation and the usefulness of tho Supreme Economic Council appeared to have come to an end.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be asked to instruct the British Ambassador in Paris to urge-,st tho Council of A&amp;brssedors, that thoSupreme Economic Council should now be dissolved.(b) That tho President of the Board of trade should bear this decision in mind in case it might be necessary to retain temporarily in London any foreign experts of the SupremoEconomic Council in connection with tho neg-negotiations with the Russian Trade Delegation.O
(8) (a)   With reference to Cabinet 22 (20), Conclusion 1,the Cabinet hod before them a Memorandum by the Food Con-troller (Paper CP.2033)&apos; and a Memorandum by the Chairmencf the Sugar Commission (Paper CP.2049) dealing with the question of the cessation of the operations of the RoyalCommission on Sugar Supplies end of the domestic rationing of sugar.It was explained that the essential facts in thehome situation were a shortage of supply, and a tendency onthe part ox consumers to restrict their consumption ratherthan pay higher prices than those now ruling.In the view of the advisers of tho Ministry ofFood, the unwillingness of consumers to pay more was asufficient barrier to any serious advance in prices in theevent of de-control.     Be-control was desirable in theinterests of economy.     The Ministry of Food expenses cfadministration last year were  2, 00,000, this year  1,500 , CCOand next year the estimate was  500,000.    This estimate is based on the assumption that sugar will shortly be de-controlled.      There was, however, another end difficultaspect of the question   the position of the sugar refiners,whose operations had been controlled by the Governmentthroughout the war, end who were desirous that tho sugar commission should, continue to purchase and import raw sugaron their behalf for an indefinite period.     In support ofthis, they advanced tho difficulty of obtaining adequateworking capital and ,t.be grave objection to taking overpurchases on a falling market.      The pre-war price of rawsugar was 15/-, as compared with 35/- and 40/- today, endtha sugar refiners anticipated a fall to 20/-.      In pre-war days they were able to import sugar from the Continentin three days, but now it took six or seven weeks to bring a cargo from Java.     The result was that several cargoeswere on the seas simultaneously, and they had to be financedin Java.     In those circumstances the Sugar Commission andtns refiners proposed that, while the Government removed
domestic restrictions on price and consumption, the Sugara.--&apos;       Commission should continue to purchase raw sugar.It was tile opinion of the Ministry of food that some limited assistance to refiners was justified, and that the precise way of renderihor this assistance oe yet to be invest-igated.In the course of tho discussion it was suggested thatit might he possible to dispose of the Government stocks of sugar through the agency of the sugar refiners, and to allow them to repay the money thus obtained, on easy terms, say,over 12 or 18 months instead of the much shorter time norms1-ly required.    This, it was estimated, would be equivalent togranting them a credit of about  20,000,000.HE POSITION (b)..In connection with the. foregoing discussion on Sugarf MEAT.Supplies j the attention of the Cabinet was called, to the pres-ent position of.Wheat.    Up to a few days ago the Wheat Corn-mission were selling wheat to the millers at nearly the world price, but the recent rapid fall In the world price raised thequestion of the price at which we should continue to supply the millers.    Ought the Treasury to draw on the unexpendedportion of the Subsidy to bear the loss due to the fall- in price-, and thus give the advantage to the consumer at theexpense of the taxpayer, or ought the loss to be put direct-ly on the price of the loaf?   The opinion was expressed thatthe loss ought not to fall upon the Treasury.The Cabinet agreed  fa) That the Minister of Pood should beauthorised to remove all restrictionson the price and consumption of sugarin this country at an-early date, andthat he should have discretion to take such steps as he thought necessary to -give effect to this decision, and as tothe form in which he should announce itto the public-:

St.-       Hill (Secretary).(i) To examine the present //heatposition, with special referenceto the price at which wheat shallbe sold to the millers, flour tothe baxers, and bread to the eon-sumers:(ii) To examine the policy to be fol-lowed in regard to the purchaseof sugar and the position of the sugar refiners,and to report upon both ,.iioat and sugar to the Cabinet.
