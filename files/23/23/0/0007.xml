With reference to H.A.C.-75, Minute 2, the Committeeompensation. resumed  consideration of the recommendations contained in theReport of the Departmental Committee on the law relating toworkmen&apos;s compensation. The Home Secretary stated that he wished for authority to draft a Bill based on the Committee&apos;sproposals, and particularly on those relating to (1) compulsory insurance, (2) rates of benefit, (3) the appointment of the Commis-sioner and (4) the Department in which the Commissioner should beemployed.[4877]
compulsory insurance.The Departmental Committee were agreed that State insurance&apos;was impracticable. The system of compulsory insurance propWedwould, in conjunction with the agreement made with the AccidentOffices Association, enable 70 per cent, of the premiums to be devotedto benefits as against only 48 per cent, under the present arrange-ments, with an estimated saving to employers of 1,250,OOOL to1,500,000a per annum. The County Court judges and others con-cerned with the administration of the present law were strongly infavour of a compulsory system for the protection of the employeeagainst the employer who was unable to pay any compensation and(more frequently) the employer who could only make a partial andinadequate payment. If compulsory insurance is not adopted, thescheme of pensions for children would probably have to be abandoned and the 70 per cent, agreement with the Insurance Companiesmodified in their favour. No opposition was forthcoming from theEmployers1 Associations. It was out of the question to combine thepresent system of compensation with National Health Insurance, andthe pledges given made the early introduction of legislation most desirable.On the other hand, the Committee were reminded of theobjections to a compulsory system set out in pp. 77-79 of the Report.The system wotild require a very large and expensive organisation,and the proposal that the insurance societies should collect the costof administration, from the employers involved a novel principle.There would be serious objection to compulsory insurance withprofit-making companies, and the provisions for enabling largeemployers &quot;to contract out&quot; in practice made the scheme a com-pulsory one for the poor man.It was generally thought that the scheme could be moreconveniently discussed by the Committee if incorporated in a Bill,and it was agreed- That the Bill to be drafted for the. Committee&apos;s consideration. should contain provisions for compulsory insurance on thedistinct understanding that the Committee was in no waypledged by this procedure to the compulsory principle.Benefits: &quot;Death.&quot; The Committee were informed that in cases of death the widow&apos;compensation would be 2501., while separate provision would bemade for children in the form of weekly allowances, which wouldbe provided by a &quot;flat&quot; payment of 500/. into a Central fund under Government control in every case where a child under 15 was left.   The maximum liability in case of death would be 800Z.Objection was raised to the proposals on the ground of seriousreaction on Health Insurance, and some discussion took place as to.the adequacy of the &quot; flat&quot; 500L rate, from which it transpired thatthat figure would only be sufficient so long as 5 per cent, and higherinterest is obtainable. If Government credit improves, or if thecost of administration exceeds the margin of interest, the 500Z.might have to be increased. In any case a triennial revaluation ofthe whole scheme was contemplated, and the 500Z. would be subjectto variation on the results brought out. At the request of theCommittee the Home Secretary agreed To endeavour to furnish the Committee with an estimate of thecost of administering the scheme. In this connection itwas suggested that the experience of the Special GrantsCommittee of the Ministry of Pensions might behelnful.JLNote.  Since the meeting Sir A. Watson has re-examined his original calculations, and has come to the conclusion thata small sum, not exceeding 5 per cent, of the whole, mightbe taken for administration out of the 500L capital, the500Z. being thus divided : 4751. for benefits and 25/. for adminsitrative expenses.
capacity.&quot; In cases of incapacity it was proposed to give two-thirds wagesuh instead of half wages as at present, and to raise the 20s. weeklymaximum (35s. with the &quot; war &quot; increase) to 60s. weekly. It waspointed out that it was dangerous to base a permanent schemeof compensation on present high rates of wages, and that theseproposals would have to be compared with the awards given to thetotally disabled ex-service man who, if not bedridden, gets 40s.a-week. Unless it was possible to differentiate between the two classes of case, the pensions would have to be raised at an annual cost of 2O,OOO,O0OL The members of the Committee present, otherthan the Home Secretary, thought that the 60s. maximum was too high, and it was agreed That the rates of benefit proposed in section 7 of the HomeSecretary&apos;s Memorandum (C.P.-1746) should be incor-porated in the draft Bill on the understanding that theCommittee were in no way pledged by this procedure to approval of the rates in question.Administering Considerable discussion took place on the suggestion that theDepartment. Home Office should be the Department in which the commissioner and his staff should be employed. It was represented that as underthe scheme the State would be indirectly interested in restoration ofthe injured to health, the Ministry of Health should be the respon-sible Department. Many of the functions to be assigned to theCommissioner were similar in character to those now undertaken bythe Insurance Department of the Ministry. The Minister of Healththought that while the medical and treatment functions should be assigned to his Department, the judicial and administrative work,apart from that of treatment, should remain in the Home Office.The dangers of overlap were emphasised. The Home Secretarypointed out that it was not proposed in the Bill to deal withtreatment (which, he agreed, was a matter for the Ministry ofHealth) beyond making provision for the payment of the cost by the employers. After he had indicated that if the Home office was not to administer the Act he could not be responsible fordrafting the Bill, the Committee agreed That the question of the Department responsible for workmen&apos;compensation in future should be referred to the cabinet for decision.Bee Disease Bill. 2. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture covering a draft Bill providing for theprevention of the introduction and spread of pests and diseasesaffecting bees (C.P.-2020).It was explained that the bee population of the country had gone down very considerably owing to the prevalence of variousdiseases, and an organised effort was being made to improve theposition by the introduction of queen bees from Italy, but further powers to regulate the importation and to enforce measures of disintegration-fection of infected hives were necessary. It would be quite possiblefor this country to produce all the honey it required given a healthy beepopulation. In 1918 we had imported honey to the value of 2,500,0001.,much of which was inferior to what could be produced at horne.The Committee gave their general approval1 to the introductionof the Bill in the House of Lords subject to the omission of clause 5 (registration of bee-keepers), and to the modification of clause 6 (local authorities), which shouldbe altered so as to make the obligation of the localauthorities permissive and not compulsory.
