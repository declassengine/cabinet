1 *    The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Economy Proposals to belaid before Parliament:-Report of the Cabinet Committee onEconomy (Paper No. CP. 208 (31));A Memorandum by the First Lcrd of theAdmiralty (Paper No. CP. 210 (31)),calling attention to certain para-graphs in papers of the precedingGovernment (Papers- Nos. N.E.  (31) 22and N.E.  (31) 34), dealing withdockyard wages and naval pay and pensions;A Memorandum by the Minister of health and the Minister of Labour (Paper No.CP. 211  (31)), on the subject of thepossible use of the Public assistance authorities in assessing the amountspayable by the Ministry of Labour toinsured persons not entitled to ordinary benefit.The Prime Minister said that, for theconsideration of this question,, he had instructed the Secretary to invite to the Cabinet those ministers whose Departments were especiallyaffected by the proposals of the EconomyCommittee.
2.    Arising out of a consideration of theproposed economies in expenditure on Education inEngland and Wales,  the Cabinet discussed at some length the date at which the scheme of economieswas to be brought into operation.It was explained that, so far as theBoard of Education was concerned, the questionof the date was governed by the contracts of the teachers.      These contracts, which were entered/into, not by the State but by the Local EducationAuthorities (to whom the State pays a percentagegrant), provided, in the event of a change in conditions, for notice which varied from one month to six.      The Burnham Scale, on which the ratesof pay were based, was a contractual obligation,enforceable in a Court of Law, which made itimpossible to abrogate the rates summarily.     an alteration in the conditions of contracts wouldrequire a good deal of negotiation.      such negotiations were far more likely to result in adurable settlement if they could be dealt with asa whole,  that is to say,  if the date of operationof the economies, so far as the teachers were concerned,  could be postponed until April 1st.The President of the Board of Educationintimated that some small economies could beeffected in the current financial year if thedate of commencement was fixed at January 1st, 1932*but this would involve great administrativeconfusion, and he could not recommend it, particu-larly in view of the relatively small economies
that could be realised in the present financialyear.      January 1 st was the earliest date atwhich economies could begin to operate, andhe emphasised that on a long view there weregreat advantages in commencing all the new contracts on the same date.The postponement of the date forcommencement of economies until January 1st,and still more until April 1st, in the case ofthe Board of Education, was found to presentoverwhelming objections from the point of viewof the scheme of economies as a whole.     from the political and psychological aspect theCabinet felt strongly that in the present gravenational emergency it was important to put thescheme into operation at the earliest date and,as far as possible, as a whole.     The FightingServices hoped to be able to begin theireconomies on pay,  cost of living, and pensionsfrom October 1st, provided that the cabinet took a decision without delay, but the ministers concerned advised that the personnel affectedcould only be induced to accept the reductionsinvolved if assured that it was essential tothe salvation of the country and provided thatequal sacrifices were made by all branches ofthe public service.      This latter considerationapplied equally to the police forces.      the exemption of one branch of the publicservice was calculated greatly to increase thedifficulty of securing acceptance in other branches.     The Cabinet felt also that the moral right of the Fighting Services and the
Police to regard their conditions of pay and pensions as a contract,  even though it was notenforceable in a Court of Law, was not inferior tothat of the teachers.Various suggestions were made as to how the difficulties of the President of the Board ofEducation might be overcome.      One such suggestion was to make the teachers&apos;  cuts in some wayretrospective.      Thus, as a condition of their new contracts, they might have to make up thebalance next year,  or they might be given the option, either of accepting voluntarily the reductionin their- salaries at once, or of foregoing later ona corresponding amount.      Political objections tothis course were pointed out.     Another suggestion was that all branches of the public serviceincurring cuts in salaries, wages or pay, includingteachers, might be given a note stating the amountdue to them on their present scale,  together with thesum to be deducted owing to the present financialemergency.      By this means the money would beobtained at once;    there would be no question ofa breach of contract;    and time would be gained for negotiations for a more permanent settlement.      this latter course, however, was found to be open to considerable objections.      For example, it would greatly increase the difficulties of giving any degree of permanence to the reductions even in thecase of classes of public servants who arenotoriously over-paid, and would lead to demands forre-instatement of the original amount.      Theproposal was rejected.
The President of the Board of Education,while emphasising the great difficulties involved in upsetting existing legislation and contracts without having time to conduct thenecessary negotiations,  (in which connection he instanced the complication of the voluntary schools), undertook to do his best to meetthe desire of the Gabinet that teachers&apos; economiesshould be on the same basis as those affectingthe Fighting Services and the Police,  (notwith-standing the difference in the contractualrelation of teachers to the State), and shouldtake effect as from October 1st.      The PrimeMinister said that the Gabinet fully appreciated the difficulties of the President of the Boardof Education, and would do their best to assist them in carrying out their decision.The Cabinet agreed:-That the date at which economies in salaries, pay and pensions should begin to operate shouldbe October   1st, 1951.(NOTE:-   For Conclusions arising outof the above discussionaffecting the Fighting Services,see Conclusion J).
3.    Subject to the remarks of the President ofthe Board of Education summarised above as to thedifficulty of realising extensive economies inthe year T-9;5&apos;1 *  the Cabinet agreed  That Local Authorities shouldbe informed that, as from 1st October, grants will be calculated on a gross total for teachers&apos; salaries, with a deduction of 1ffi from thepresent level;    and that thepresent 6o  grant shall bereduced to ^Of-, but the grantregulations to be adjusted toensure that this reduction doesnot involve a transfer of charge to rates.    Deficiency grant tobe terminated.    Growth of Millionsexpenditure next year to be cut down.  9.if
O&amp;TIONfLAND).eviouserence:inet 43(31),lclusion 2(B) ,&amp; (c)).If.    The Secretary of State for Scotland explainedthat the Burnham Scale did not apply in Scotland,where teachers T salaries were governed by aNational Minimum Scale.     At the last computationit had been ascertained that the amounts paidin the aggregate exceeded the national minimumby  875*000*      Recently some cuts had been made ,e.g. 10$ at Glasgow.      In these circumstancesan all-round cut of 15$ was impracticable.      Ifmade it would result in a great discrepancy in pay of teachers in Scotland as compared with england.    Nevertheless he was prepared to acceptthe recommendations of the Committee on Economy.He would have to undertake negotiations with theEducation Authorities in Scotland at once in orderto work out the application of the scheme.The Cabinet approved the following recommendation of the Cabinet Committee:-Education (Scotland).11/80 of saving in Englandand Wales  million-3
5.    The chancellor of the Exchequer reportedthat when recommending that the reduction of 250,000 in the grants to the Universities,which had been adopted by the late Government,should not take place, the Gabinet Committee onEconomy had been under the impression that thewhole of the amount was already allocated tocontracts running for five years ahead.     Ithad since been ascertained that a sum of 150,000 had not been allocated in this manner.The Cabinet agreed  As regards University grants to impose a reduction of.... 150,000.
6.    The Home Secretary stated that he had net the  Police Council and had discussed with them the economy proposals.      He was to meet themagain later in the week.      He was not confident that the negotiations could be completed in timefor the economies to begin quite as early asOctober 1st.      The police, like the FightingServices,  could only be induced to accept the cutsin pay and pensions provided that it was necesaaryto the salvation of the country, and provided thatall branches of the public service made equivalentsacrifices.      The police were paid to the extentof half by the State and half by the LocalAuthorities.      Consequently the Police council made the point that other municipal servants suchas street scavengers, who are well paid,  shouldreceive corresponding reductions, a matter which,he suggested, should be considered by the Ministerof Health.    The Police Council had also enquired,-with reference to the proposed reductions in public pensions, whether other branches of thepublic service were to receive correspondingreductions.Questions were asked as to the preciseeffect of the economies on the national and local expenditure and the Home Secretary undertook tomake further enquiries. %The Cabinet approved the following recommendation of the Cabinet CommitteePolice.   millions in pay(l2-g$ cut/in. two instalments        \ .5
hIGHPING- 7.     The first part of the  consideration given toCES.economies proposed for the Fighting Services took placeiouspence:       during discussion of the date at which the scheme ofPt?    . * o    economies is to begin to take effect.  (Minute 1).ight of An important point that arose incidentally to thatarp.c on&apos;    discussion was as to whether the &quot;other ranks&quot; of thebion ofate. Fighting Services, on the reduction of pay and pensions,1* should have the right of claiming their release from theircontract to serve and taking their discharges.     officers are normally allowed to resign at any time, but couldtechnically be held to serve.     The First Lord of theAdmiralty made it clear that, so far as the Navy was concerned, the effect of permitting men to leave the service would be disastrous, as the ratings most likely to takeadvantage of the concession would be the Chief PettyOfficers and Petty Officers and the older and more exper-experienced men from whom the Petty Officers were usuallyselected for promotion.     Great numbers might take theirdischarge, with the result that suitable men for these keypositions would not be available, and the consequent damage to the efficiency Of the Service would be incalculable.The Secretary of State for War  (although less insistentthan the First Lord of the Admiralty) and the Secretary ofState for Air accepted for the Army and Royal Air Forcerespectively that permission to terminate engagementsshould not be adopted as a sequel to the cuts in pay.ADMIRALTYDockyard Wages.     The First Lord of the Admiralty intimated that, subject to some slight necessary adjustments, he was prepared to accept the recommendation of the May Committeefor a 2/-s. cut in Dockyard Wages.     But the intention ofthe Admiralty, after consultation with the Ministry ofI
Labour, was to proceed through the usual channel of negotiation with the competent body.     This would mean in practice that, failing agreement, resort would haveto be had to Arbitration.     This course, however, theFirst Lord explained was not likely to result In an adverse award.The Cabinet approved this course.The Fleet.     The First Lord of the Admiralty warned theCabinet, and asked them to place it. on record, that theft.       Navy had in recent years been cut to the bone and hadtyll      been &quot;living on its fatT&apos; without replacement.     Thebuilding programme was drawn up on the assumption thatthere would be no great war for ten years, an assumption?;hich (as he had learned during his membership of theThree-Party Committee on Disarmament) was no longer validon a logical interpretation of the Foreign office memorandum on the subject.      Personnel was reduced to apoint where the day-to-day requirements of the fleet were difficult to meet.     Stores were depleted.     Repairs to ships were seriously in arrears.      It was due to theBoard of Admiralty and to himself to state that the Navywas, even novj and apart from the economies, not capableof carrying out its tasks if a major war should break out.Nevertheless the gravity of the financial situationrendered economy indispenable, and risks must be run to save the State.     The only way In which the  2,000,000economies, over and above those recommended by the Committeeon National Economy could be realised, was by postponinguntil October 1952 the ships that were to have been laiddown.on the last day of the present financial year.That economy could not be repeated in a future year.
9 OIf the financial position improved the situation could still be retrieved before 1936, the year when it was important to reach our national standard.     Meanwhilealternative economies would be sought for with a view to avoiding so long a postponement of the commencement ofthe building programme, but he was not sanguine on thispoint.The First Lord further pointed out that the build-Ing programme included no provision for the frustrationof the programme of the London Naval Treaty, which seemed likely to arise owing to the failure of France andItaly to come to terms.     There was every prospect thatwe should enter the Disarmament Conference with ourweaknesses fully disclosed and in a bad position tonegotiate.Subject to the above remarks the First Lord of theAdmiralty accepted the proposals of the Cabinet Committeeon Economy.THE WAR office the Secretary of State for War said that the ArmyCouncil are asked for two separate contributions to the economy programme of the Government.-(i) A sum equal to the total of the economiesrecommended by the May Committee, viz:-  1,693,000.This reduction is expected to be permanent.     The ArmyCouncil had already, in a letter to the Treasury of14th August, pledged themselves to make this contribu-&quot;tion, but had asked to be allowed a little latitude asregards the precise amount of the cuts on Research,Education, Inspection, Works, etc., provided that they find equivalent savings of, say,  100,000, elsewhere.
To give full effect, to the May Report on Research and inspection might involve the discharge of severalhundreds of employees.(ii) An additional sum of  2,000,000 for the year1932/3 which was, it was understood, in the nature of atemporary sacrifice.     Among the steps by which this could be achieved he mentioned a suspension of all camps and training ( 1,000,000) and the bringing of ReservePay Into line with the present cost of living ( 500,000).Certain classes, e.g. Policemen who are Army Reservists,would be hit twice.     Similar action in regard to other classes would yield  120,000.     The Army Council askedfor a little longer time for consideration of how tomake up the remaining  400,000, but pledged themselvesto respond in full to the demand for the double sacrifice of  1,693,000 *  2,000,000,  it being understood that this may Involve the discharge of perhaps 250 men from theRoyal Ammunition and Pilling Factory.The Prime Minister urged that every effort should bemade to avoid the discharge of men in view of the extentof probable unemployment during the winter.AIR MINISTRY.The Secretary of State for Air reported that, given some latitude as to the method, the Air Ministry would find means to meet the reduced claim for  500,000.     Hewarned the Cabinet that this Involved such expedientsas temporarily reducing the intake of short servicepilots for training, of aircraft apprentices for Halt on and of aircraft hands In the less skilled trade groups.These were postponements that could only take effect forone year.     It also involved using machines that, other-wise, would have been scrapped.
9 r.rWhile sharing the misgivings of the Ministers atthe head of the three Fighting Services as to the graveeffects of the economies on the efficiency of these services, the Cabinet felt that In the present financialemergency there was no alternative but to adopt them,and agreed:-(a) To approve the following recommendation ofthe Cabinet Committee on Economy - &quot;Recommen-dations of the May Committee were  4.1 million.In addition,  the Admiralty will save  2 millionnext year by postponement of commencement ofbuilding programme, the War Office  2 million,In ways not specified&quot;,   (but see above) &quot;andAir Ministry       million&apos; .millions8.6(b) That permission   oshould not be granted to &quot;other ranks1&apos;as a sequel to reductions in pay, cost ofliving and pensions, to  claim release fromtheir contract to serve and to take theirdischarge.(Note:   Officers are normally allowed to resign at any time, but couldtechnically be held to serve).(c) To take note of the warning of the FirstLord of the Admiralty as to the risks incurred by these decisions.(d) To take note of and approve the Intentionof the Board of Admiralty, in carrying out thereduction In Dockyard Wages, to proceed throughF.R. the usual channel of negotiation with theSof^fe competent body, involving, in the event of a* failure to reach agreement, resort to arbitra-t ion.(e) To urge the Service Ministers to do their utmost to avoid or limit discharge of workers.(Note:     For the decision as to Airships see followingMinute).
8.    The Secretary of State for Air reported thatit would be impossible for the Air Ministry tooUS achieve the full economies asked of them if theence:: ^ 28&apos; present airship policy was maintained.      Thelon-,n 2j.). alternative policy, which he would greatly regretto adopt, would involve the scrapping of theW- Airship R. 100,  the Cardington Royal Airship Works,and, what was even more serious,  the airshippersonnel.     He gave the Cabinet full particulars.The Cabinet were reminded that a greatdeal of scepticism existed in the country at large as  to the value of airships.      The continuation ofthe present policy at a time when sacrifices werebeing imposed all round would be exposed to heavycriticism.While greatly regretting the necessity of changing the policy,  the Cabinet agreed  (a) To adopt the   first  alternative policy that was submitted to theHouse of Commons by the PrimeMinister on 12fth May, 1 931 ;NOTE:- An extract from the PrimeMinister&apos;s speech in the Houseof Commons is given below:-&quot;If the first alternative were adopted, we should destroy, ordispose of in some way or other,the airship R.. 100, which is nowin our possession.     We shouldsell, or turn to other uses, whichare not easy to find I may say,or, at any rate, we should changecompletely the character and theutility of the Cardington RoyalAirship Works.      We should haveto make arrangements for termina-ting our responsibility for ourbases in Egypt and elsewhere.    Ina word, we should have to give upall interest in airship develop-ment, except in so far as we mighthave a secretariat, a recordingdepartment with files of informa-tion acquired from foreign experience.We might have information, but we-15-
should have no initiative.We should be in the position ofbeing able to give information to this Committee or this Houseabout what somebody else isdoing, but we should be takingno part ourselves in the pioneer-ing work of discovering whetherairships have a future or not..The cost of that has been estimated at something like 20,000 a year,  the greater partconsisting of docketed informa-tion and books of facts.&quot;(b) That an expert nucleus should beretained by the Air Ministry, inorder to watch developments inairships, meteorology,  etc., and,to enable touch to be kept withexperiments and developments abroad,efforts should be made from time totime to attach members of the experts staff to the relevantGerman and American organisations.
9.    The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinet thathe,  in company with one of his colleagues, would see representatives of the press the same evening,in order to explain that vast programmes of economy and taxation could not be produced within a few hours;    that piecemeal announcements could not bemade, and that the policy as a whole could not bemade public in anticipation of the meeting ofParliament.
MINISTRY OPHEALTHECONOMIES.en.(previous reference:Cabinet 43(31),Conclusion 2,(A) &amp; (K)).(previous reference:Cabinet 36(31),Conclusion l) .10.    The Cabinet next began to discuss economiesby the Ministry of Health, and more particularlycertain points on which the Minister had promised to the Gabinet Committee to make further enquiries.The Minis ter of Health said he hoped to be able to realise the recommendation of theCabinet Committee on Economy in favour of economies to the extent of  1.25 millioias, andpossibly a little more.Rural Housing Act.By postponing, work on the recent rural housing Act,  the Minister thought that economiescould be achieved to the extent of  200,000 ina full year.      This would involve giving immediatenotice to the Advisory Committee and to Sir TudorWalters and the Rural District councils association.     A decision was urgent as theAdvisory Committee for Scotland was due to meeton Thursday, September Jrd.      He thought it wouldalso be advisable to insert some mention in the economy Bill as to the suspension, although infact it could be achieved by administrative action.Some apparent discrepancy was noticedbetween figures given by the Minister and those given to the late Cabinet by his predecessor, asto the numbers of men likely to be employeddirectly or indirectly by the operation of theAct,  if retained.The subject was adjourned until thefollowing day, and the Minister of health and the Secretary to the Cabinet&apos;-were asked to look into the question of thefigures.
if)Prolongation of Insurance Act.The Minister of Health reported thateconomies could be realised by allowing the prolongation of Insurance Act to lapse, and bydropping the Exchequer grant in aid to the approved Societies central fund.      New legislation would also be avoided by this proposal.      Thissuggestion was discussed, and the Prime Ministerinvited the Minister of Health to consider, inthe light of the discussion, whether it was worth while to press this proposal.The subject was adjourned untilthe meeting on the following day.Transfer from the Pensions Account of the national health Insurance funds of the health insurancepart of the contributions payable in respect ofpersons in employment over the age of 6*5.On the recommendation of the Minister ofHealth,   the Cabinet agreed  That the health insurance part of thecontributions payable invrespect ofpersons in employment, over the ageof 65, should, as from the 1st January,1      1928? be transferred from the PensionsC*d\t&amp; tHvwiC j -    Account/of the National Health Insurance-Lj1 Hncro .National Health Insurance. The Doctors&apos; CapitationRate.The Minister of Health reported that he hoped that the doctors could be persuadedvoluntarily to accept a capitation rate of 8/-instead of 9/-.     Legislation would be requiredin order to provide that the benefit of thereduction should accrue to the Exchequer and notto the Approved Societies.-1 9-
previous reference:cabinet 36(51),lonclusion 9).Maternity and Specialist Services.The Minister of Health,  in reply to aquestion, stated that the policy of his predecessoron Maternity and Specialist Services still requiredmuch time for negotiation, and for the momentthere was no question of expenditure or economy.
iZNEXT MEETING OP 11 .
