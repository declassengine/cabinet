UploymentRation to0St of Living.previous reference erence:rabinet 55(Si), Con-fusion 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP.-250 (31)) pointing outthat in the debates on the Economy Bill stress hasbeen laid on the fact that the cut in UnemploymentBenefit had been justified by the Prime minister on the ground of the fall in the cost of living,and that the question had been pressed, and would arise in debate the same afternoon, whether, if thecost of living rises, the rate of benefit will be correspondingly increased.   He proposed to reply onthe following, lines:-&quot;There has not up to the presentbeen any increase in the cost ofliving, and the question is there-fore a purely hypothetical one.But, leaving this aside, it isnecessary to bear in mind that thecost of living is not the onlyfactor to be taken into account.The reduction of Benefit was not made only because the cost of livinghas fallen, though the fall in thecost of living mitigates the effectof the reduction.    There is another and very important reason, and thatis that the Fund will not carryBenefits on the present scale withoutrecourse to borrowing   which it is absolutely imperative to stop   or without such an increase of contri-butions as would be quite unjustifiablein relation to the resources of thosewho have to pay these contributionswhile they are at work&quot;.The Cabinet approved that theMinister of Labour should takethe above line in the Debate.
2.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP.-245 (51)) circulatingfor the approval of the Cabinet a draft of the Orderin Council to be made under the Economy Act altering the rates of Unemployment Insurance contributions and benefit.The Cabinet considered that this was a matter for the Minister of Labour to settle, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who reportedthat the Treasury had agreed in the draft Order.
ECONOMIES .Salaries of judges .(previous reference:Gabinet 50(31), Con-clusion 11.)f.ft.3,     The Gabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (CP.-346 (31)) pressing for are-consideration of the 20 per cent, cut in the judges&apos; salaries.The suggestion was made that reductions ofthis kind might be made easier of acceptance ifsalaries were accompanied by a statement setting forth the amount of the basic salary together with theamount of the emergency cut.      It was suggested,however, that the income tax might be affected by adopting this method.      The Chancellor of theExchequer undertook to look into the proposal.The Cabinet were unable to vary their previous decision in favour of a reduction of 20$in the salaries of Judges, and suggested that theLord Chancellor might see the Judges, explain thecircumstances, and point out that the new scale of salaries had been adopted to meet an emergency and wasnot to be regarded as permanent and final.-3-
IRISH FREESTATE.Appeals to thejudicial Com-njittee of the privy Council.(previous reference:Cabinet      2&amp;(SI), Con-clusion St)4.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (CP.-241 (31)) attachinga draft Motion for carrying over the London passenger transport Bill until the next Session of Parliament:together with an Opinion from Parliamentary Counselto the effect that an Order in the terms of thedraft Motion would enable the Bill to be resumedat the stage which it has now reached, notwithstand-ing that the dissolution of Parliament intervened,and stating the grounds for this Opinion.   Attachedalso was a similar Motion adopted in 1903 in the case of the Port of London (Hybrid) Bill, on whichthe Draft Motion for carrying over the london passenger Transport Bill was founded.The Cabinet were reminded that at the end ofthe last Parliament a carry forward was allowed inthe case of the London Traffic Bills promoted bythe London County Council and the Undergroundgroup.     These were strictly private Bills, but infact remarkably analogous to the London passenger transport Bill.The Cabinet agreed that  (a) The Minister of Transport shouldhave authority to introduce the draftMotion attached to CP. 2ki  (31) forcarrying over the London passenger transport Bill until the next Sessionof Parliament, provided that the speaker&apos;s Counsel was satisfied thatthis course was in order;(b).The Minister of Transport should place himself in communication withthe Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury on the subject.a
