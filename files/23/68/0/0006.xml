1 .    Sir Ernest Harvey,  the Deputy Governor ofthe Bank of England, and Mr. Peacock, werepresent by invitation to inform the Cabinet as tothe present and prospective financial situation.The view of the bankers was that opinion abroadwould be greatly influenced by the kind ofreception that the Government&apos;s measures weregiven by British public opinion.     A summaryof the proceedings is placed on record with thestandard copy of the Cabinet Minutes.
2.    The First Lord of the Admiralty asked,as a matter of urgency,  to consult the Cabineton a matter which,  though of secondary importance,might affect a question of policy extending beyondthe Services.After the meeting of the Cabinet at whicheconomies by the Fighting Services had beendiscussed, the three Service Ministers had agreedto appoint a Liaison Committee in order to effect co-ordination in Service economies.      Onematter which had come before the Committee wasthe proposal   of the May Committee for areduction in clothing allowances.      He was informedthat the naval clothing allowance was paid in cash to personnel of the Fleet, and that it waspossible that a prudent man could save somethingout of&apos; it, after providing the necessary clothing.It had, therefore, come to be regarded almost as an addition to pay, and if it were cut thereduction would be regarded as a second reductionin pay.The First Lord of the Admiralty was advised by his Department that it would be lessunpopular to make a cut in the allowance payable in lieu of the grog ration.      The application ofthe cut to this item would actually produce alarger saving than a cut in the clothing allowance.It had been ascertained from the Liaison Committeethat the other Services had no objection.Since the question bordered on temperance,however, the First. Lord had felt that the Cabinet
ought to know what he proposed.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the First Lord of the Admiralty,and authorised him to make a saving on the allowance in lieu of grog rather than on clothing.-3-
3.     The Cabinet were informed in connection withthe Conclusion referred to in the margin that theCabinet Committee on.the National Economy Bill had considered the first draft of the Bill at the meeting that morning, and had adopted a number of amendments?/hich had been Incorporated in a revise of the Bill,copies of which were handed round at the Meeting ofthe Cabinet  (CP. 218(31) Revise).     The Cabinet were informed that it was proposed that the draft Billshould be further examined by a Conference of those ministers whose Departments would, be in any wayaffected by its provisions.The attention of the Cabinet was particularlyinvited to the period of time after the commencementof the Act within which Orders In Council could bemade.     The Cabinet Committee had provisionallyInserted one month.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefact that under the Bill, as drafted, Orders inCouncil once made In pursuance of its provisions,could not be amended or altered except by legislation passed through Parliament In the ordinary way.     Therewas no provision in the Bill under which the Orderscould be amended or altered or revoked by subsequentOrders in Council.     In the course of discussion itwas pointed out that a new Government desiringhereafter to modify the economy policy of the present government would be unable to do so unless the Houseof Lords was willing to pass their amending legislation,and that this aspect of the Bill would be severely criticised.     On the other hand, emphasis was laid onthe vital importance of Insuring continuance of policy
with regard to the economies if public confidencewas to be re-established, and reference was also made to the great difficulties of finding anyworkable alternative to the procedure contemplated in the Bill as at present drafted.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the period of one month in Clause I (i), provided that on examination the Ministers concernedwith the various Orders in council were satisfied that this gave themsufficient time.(b) To give general approval to the DraftBill, attached to CP. 218(21), subjectto the procedure mentioned below.(c) That the Secretary to the Cabinet should circulate the Draft Bill and a covering letter from Parliamentary Counsel to ministers who should subject it tocareful examination.(d) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should instruct the Treasury, inconsultation with all GovernmentDepartments concerned in economy, toprepare a draft of a White Paper to be presented to Parliament simultaneously with the Economy Bill.     The white paper should Include administrative economies as well as those requiringlegislative sanction.(e) That the Bill with any proposed amend-ments and the Draft White Paper shouldbe examined by a Conference of Ministers,composed as follows:-The Prime minister the Chancellor of the exchequer the Home secretary the Minister of health the Secretary of State for scotland the President of the Board ofEducationThe Minister of Agriculture andFisheriesThe Minister of labour the Minister of Transport.The Financial Secretary to theTreasury.

SECRETSECRETARY*S NOTES OF A CONVERSATION between sir ERNEST HARVEY AND MR.PEACOCK and members OF THE CABINET ONTHURSDAY,  SEPTEMBER 3RD1951 AT 5 P.M.The Prime Minister asked if the Deputy governor of the Bank would he willing to tell the Cabinet something ofthe financial situation in order that the Cabinet might be ina position to judge the probable outlook and whether there was any way in which they could render assistance.     He felt thatthe policy must be considered on the long view.Sir Ernest Harvey said that since the announcementof the formation of the present Government the position hadsomewhat improved and withdraraLs of foreign exchange haddiminished.     Such withdrawals, however, were still larger thanthe Bank cared to see and reasons for this were difficult to assess.     The withdrawals varied much from day to day:    one day the demand would be principally for dollars with smalldemands for francs, whilst the next day the position would be reversed.     The previous day had been bad in this respect;nearly  2 millions of foreign exchange had been lost.     To-dayup to midday the position had been rather better and with-withdrawals more moderate.     He had considered the possibility ofsome of the withdrawals by Paris having been made to providefunds for investment in the British loan in France and arrange-ments had. been made with Paris to try and check such operations,Only to-day it had been brought to his notice that a Frenchfirm had widely circularized the City, offering to obtainparticipations in the loan on behalf of British investors, and steps had at once been taken to stop this.      He was informed
by the Bank of Prance that the public issue was going well.For example, the Bank of France for the benefit of its owncustomers had itself taken a moderate participation in theloan and they reported that the whole amount had already been applied for twice over.     He believed that other French bankswere also receiving substantial demands for the loan.The precise reasons for the demands for foreign exchange were very difficult to determine.     There were fourpossible reasons, the first being foreign lack of confidence.It must be understood, however, that this is not solely due toapprehensions regarding the ultimate security of sterling.Many foreign countries, including even such countries asHolland and Switzerland, were also disturbed regarding theirown positions and were desiring to keep them as liquid aspossible.     Holland had been one of the largest withdrawers ofgold but he had learned from the Chairman of the NetherlandsBank that little of the gold so withdrawn had reached his bank.It was either being held by other banks or had passed intoprivate hoards-.      In Switzerland the situation was somewhat different.     In recent years It had been one of the principalcentres for the deposit of foreign money owing to the supposedstability and safety of the country. There was, for example,much French money in Switzerland and recent developments showed that even the Franch banking position was not in all respectssound.     The Swiss therefore were disturbed as to the results which might follow from nervousness in other countries whichmight wish to withdraw money deposited In Switzerland.     Evenin America the position is not viewed with confidence and some difficulty had arisen on that account in securing the recentcredit.     The amount originally suggested to them had beenlarger than that eventually secured.     The cause of thedifficulty was nervousness on account of the American bankingposition.     The eastern banks had more money locked up in
Germany than had London whilst in the middle-west,  owing tobad economic conditions, the banks were in a very frozen state.Thus the foreign lack of confidence must be regarded as notsolely due to apprehensions as to the position of sterling butalso to apprehensions regarding the Internal positions of thosecountries.The second possible reason was a flight from the poundby British people, but he had been unable to secure any evidencethat this had recently been on any large scale and he knev/ ofcases where orders placed with this object had subsequently been cancelled.The third possible reason was withdrawals to meet theordinary commitments of trade and commerce which usually areat their heaviest in the Autumn, and as forward dollars havebeen difficult to obtain traders may have had to cover themselves by the purchase of spot dollars.The fourth reason, which many people appeared to thinkmight be of importance, was the probable growth of demands to meet an increasing adverse balance of trade.Amongst so many possible reasons it was impossible toapportion relative degrees of importance, and they made itdifficult to estimate what was likely to happen during thenext? few months.      If demands to meet the balance of trade were a steadily growing factor it might absorb a large part of thebalance still available.Prior to the granting of the new credits the Bank, havingexhausted its own credit with the Federal Reserve Bank, had had to borrow dollars against gold temporarily earmarked atthe Bank of England.     $30 million had therefore been drawn on account of the new credit.     Out of this the dollars advancedhad been repaid and the gold released, and the rest of the
amount drawn was held as a balance to meet further requirements.This had been done in order to avoid a too constant recourse to the new credit, owing to the number of the participants inthe credit, but at the present rate of demand the balance inhand did not seem likely to last very long.     Nothing had upto the. present been drawn on the new credit in Paris where theBank still had a balance of about  300,000 available out of itsown Gredit, but this balance would soon be absorbed by commit-ments already entered into.     As already mentioned,  2 millionhad been withdrawn on the previous day and on that day, Thursday,up to midday drawings had amounted to about 100,000 in dollarsand 300,000 in francs.     Demands, however, were apt to beheaviest towards the end of the day and these withdrawals mustnot therefore be relied upon as any indication that the total for the day would be substantially less than that of theprevious day.Since the beginning of the trouble,the Bank had lostnearly  130 million, of which  35 million had been In gold. 50 million had been supplied by the Bank&apos;s credits,  somerecourse had been made to the new credit in New York as mentioned above,  and the balance had consisted of the Bank&apos;sown reserves of foreign exchange which it has been their normal practice for some time* past to maintain.     After thesewithdrawals of  130 million there remained available about 73-74 million of the new credits.     The future course of eventsdepended largely upon the attitude of the British publictowards the Governments proposals.     ,If the proposals were suchas to restore an attitude of confidence at home, foreignersmight in turn regain more confidence in the safety of london as a centre in which to deposit money.     It is necessary,however, to bear in mind the tendency of foreign countries tohoard money in times of diff ioa lty, especially when they havedoubts regarding their own domestic position.
The Deputy Governor of the Bank then referred tothe Stock market position.     There had been substantial falls in the prices of Government funds on the previous Friday,Monday and Tuesday, and it had appeared probable that a similarfall would take place on Wednesday.     He had therefore dis-cussed the position with the Government Broker and had suggested that if the latter, while disclaiming any specialknowledge, were to express in the market a purely personal opinion that it was unlikely that the taxation proposals ofthe Government would include special discrimination against any particular form of security or for a scheme of compulsoryconversion, it might have some useful effect.     The GovernmentBroker acted on this suggestion and although,   as the deputy governor had Independent reason to know, the Broker had been most careful to make it clear that he was expressing a purelypersonal opinion, the effect had been instantaneous and market prices immediately responded.     That morning in consequence,he thought, of the favourable tone of the Press, there appearedto be a distinct improvement in market sentiment.     Thereeven arose the risk that the rise in Stocks might become toorapid and lead to a sharp, reaction.     That day government stocks had risen almost at one bound a full Yf0 , and he therefore thought it well to apply a brake in order to securethat the rise should be more gradual and steady and appearto be more due to increasing satisfaction with the Govern-menfs attitude.As regards the probable course of exchange, it wasvery difficult to express any opinion as this would depend largely on political developments, as to which cabinet ministers were better able to form an opinion that he was.There were some who thought that the Bank should have reliedmore on its old weapons, that it should have allowed gold to be exported/
freely, have raised the Bank Rate, have restricted credit, andso  forth.      Their foreign friends, however, had advisedstrongly and unanimously against this course.      The crisis hadbeen one of confidence and in such cases people were less concerned about securing the margin of interest than of safeguarding capital.      The advice which the Bank had receivedappeared to be governed by a desire to avoid any course whichmight stimulate the lack of confidence and militate against thesuccess of the French public issue.When the Bank negotiated their credits amountingto  50 million they had to give an undertaking that, failingother means of repayment,  the credits would be repaid in gold.These undertakings amounted in effect to a lien on a portion oftheir existing gold holding and reduced their actual freeholding to little more than  80 million,  or about the equivalent of the new Government credits.      These latter credits, however,run for a year, and it is hoped that it may be possible to dealwi&apos;-h them within that period by some means other than the actualshipment of gold.      In the case of the Bank&apos;s credits,  thoughfixed at the outset for three months,  there was a tacitunderstanding that they would be renewable for a further similarperiod.The Deputy Governor desired to make it clear thatin the arrangement of the credits the Bank had received nothing but the greatest possible help from the authorities abroad.    Ashe had explained,  the Americans had had to bear inmind possible future difficulties of their own.      In the case of Paris, every kind of assistance had been given, and recent weeks hadmanifested a marked improvement in their willingness .to co-oper-ate.    Monsieur Moret had promised to do everything in his powerto assist and it was,   the Deputy Governor believed, known to theGovernment that Monsieur Flandin had also been extremely helpfuland had impressed upon the French Press the extent to which the
interests of France might be affected by any difficulties inGreat Britain.The Governor of the Netherlands Bank had recentlyvisited him and had described the state of nervousness which existed in Holland.     He had said that he feared that he mightbe urged to withdraw from London the whole of the Bank&apos;s fundsat present deposited there amounting to about  11 million.With a view to avoiding this he made the somewhat extraordinaryrequest that he might be furnished with an undertaking in writingby the Bank of England to pay these funds in gold on-demand if and when requested.     The Deputy Governor had stated in reply that whilst the funds in question could be withdrawn in goldimmediately if desired, the Bank of England could not earmarkgold to meet a possible demand at some future date and thus makethe Netherlands Bank a preferred creditor in the London market.The Deputy Governor had told him confidentially of the creditswhich were being arranged in Paris and New York, and on thecompletion of the negotiations had sent him a telegram reporting the definite conclusion of the arrangement.    Since that date the Dutch exchange had moved in favour of London and was now well above the gold point, and he hoped therefore that something-might have been accomplished towards allaying the extremenervousness in that quarter.      As he had said before, however,future prospects must,  in his view, depend upon the course ofpolitical developments here.In reply to a question, Sir Ernest Harvey saidthathe thought that a programme giving total results similar to thosewhich had been indicated to him by the late Government and including the points which he himself had then indicated as desirable for the satisfaction of foreign holders of sterling,would prove adequate unless it should appear later that such a programme was likely to lead to interminable political wrangle.
If the measures were passed rapidly the results should be good,always assuming that they were not followed by a rapid worseningin the position of the balance of trade.In reply to a request for his opinion as to whetherit would be wise or unwise to mention in Parliamentary debate the estimated figure of the adverse balance of trade,  the deputy Governor said that he was inclined to favour a merestatement that the balance of trade was deteriorating withoutquoting any actual figure.Mr.  Peacook agreed that it would be better to state the position in general terms,  especially as there was apossible large margin of error in any calculation on the subject.The Deputy Governor, in reply to questions,mentioned that the currencies of many foreign countries aresecured to only a limited extent on gold, and in some cases notat all on gold but mostly on foreign gold exchange andespecially on sterling.      Such countries therefore wereapprehensive lest their reserves might depreciate in the eventof a collapse of sterling and the value of their own currenciesthus be upset.Asked as to the probable effect abroad of theannouncement of a General Election, Sir Ernest said that if itwere to be thought that the result of such an Election mightjeopardise the measures contemplated for dealing with thesituation, foreign opinion might be greatly disturbed.If it should appear that there was a real determination in thecountry to make the necssary financial readjustments no harmmight result.Mr. Peacock in this connection expressed the viewthat the talk of the present Government remaining in officemerely for m period of a few weeks had been rather disturbing.If the country were aroused to a determination to rectify thefinancial position it would probably make a considerable
difference in foreign feeling.      The pound sterling was the foundation of finance all over the world and any upset in sterling would probably be a great shock to people abroad.    Theyhad a heartfelt goodwill, based largely on self-interest, towardsthe maintenance of sterling.At this point some conversation took place as to theimportance of taking all possible measures to form a soundpublic opinion, and the Prime Minister suggested that the Bankof England might help by seeing the chief Editors of theprincipal newspapers and not merely the Financial Editors, whosearticles were little read by the general public.      It was important that the papers should appreciate the relationship between the Government&apos;s measures and the maintenance of thefinancial position, and the importance to the latter of agood reception of the Government programme, especially in regardto its effect on the minds of foreigners.      It would also be helpful to give a hint that in present conditions some increasein taxation was inevitable.     Any steps of this kind should betaken by the Bank not later than Monday.Sir Ernest Harvey said that he and Mr. Peacock hadalready spent some time that day considering that question andthat the Prime Minister might rely on them to help in any way that might be possible.Mr. Snowden emphasised the importance of preparing the public mind in a general way for a considerable increase in taxation.      It should be explained that such increase wasunavoidable but would be accompanied by very large economies.Mr. Chamberlain said that a contrast was likely tobe drawn between the economies proposed by the Government andthose recommended by the May Committee which amounted to 96,500*000.      It was important to remember, however,  that outof  66 million of economies on Unemployment Insurance proposedby the May Committee.  22 million were not really an economy
but merely a transfer of charges from the taxpayer to theratepayer.      It would be very important when the Government&apos;seconomies were announced that this fact should be borne inmind and impressed on the public.Some conversation then took place as to theimportance of broadcasting, and it was suggested that personslike Mr. Hartley Withers and Sir Walter Layton might be induced to broadcast on such subjects as the effect of the collapse of sterling.      Lord d&apos;Abernon might be particularly useful if hewould give some account of his experiences of the effects of inflation in Germany.      Soimeone might also speak on the effects of the collapse of the Australian currency.The Prime Minister in conclusion thanked Sir ErnestHarvey and Mr. Peacock for their assistance.      He recalled thatsome attacks had been made on the handling of the situation by the Bank and that part of the attack against the Governmentwas that they had been too amenable to pressure from the Banks.This is due to the fact that there were millions of people who did not realise the seriousness of the crisis which theGovernment had had to face.      A little later when times werequieter he thought it would be well that the Bank of england should be prepared to meet these charges and to make some statement as to the principles which had guided them in dealingwith the general financial situation.

J06Balmoral Castle.28th August, 1931.My dear Prime Minister,The King told me to go and see the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on Tuesday and to discuss with him In. whatway His Majesty should participate in the movement for thereduction of national expenditure.      I told the Chancellorthat the King was willing to consider any proposal, no matter how drastic, but I was to explain that, after thewar, when, owing to the increased cost of living and the depreciation in the purchasing power of the pound, the civil list was found to be totally inadequate, His Majesty refusedto have recourse to Parliament and ask for an increase in theCivil List.     The King decided to carry out drastic economies and as a temporary measure to borrow  100,000 from the duchy of Lancaster.      It is therefore clear that any further reduction on a large scale will entail a fundamental changein the State functions which have hitherto been associatedwith the Monarchy.      It would involve the selling of thehorses and scrapping of the carriages used in the processionfor the Opening of Parliament;    it might entail the abolitionof the Gentlemen-at-Arms and the Be&amp;featers.     All theseeconomies would really fall on the public more than on theKing, and His Majesty therefore hesitated to suggest a 20$reduction in the Civil List.     The King, however, had come tothe conclusion that 10% would be quite possible, althoughit would no doubt entail the diminution of Court entertainments.I told the Chancellor that His Majesty thought that,instead of expressing it in terms of percentage,  it would be wiser to say that he had decided to surrender  50,000 a year from the Civil List.     The Chancellor said that he quite
agreed with. His Majesty in thinking that it would bea mistake to attempt to surrender so much as 20%, underthe special circumstances which I had referred to, andhe was of opinion that if the King said he was willingto give up  50,000 during this financial crisis thatwould have a very good effect in the country and would undoubtedly help as an example to others.I asked the Chancellor when this announcement should be made, and he thought that probably you would prefer to wait until Parliament met before making any such statement.     His Majesty, however, is of opinion that whileit would never do to be premature,  it would be a mistake togive the impression that he had been forced unwillingly togive up this sum after hearing of the voluntary sacrificeswhich have been made by Cabinet Ministers and others.The King therefore would like to leave it entirely in yourhands as to when the announcement should be made.     Ofcourse if you could not find a suitable opportunity forannouncing this in any speech which you would make in thenext fortnight or so, the statement could be made in theform of a letter written by me to yourself which couldbe published.Yours sincerely,(Sd.) P. PONS0NBY.jFhe Rt.Hon. James Ramsay MacDonald, M.P.-2-P.S.     The Members of the Royal Family are also anxious to surrender a proportionate amount of the grants which they receive from Parliament.     The members and servants of theRoyal Household also wish to participate in the movement andare prepared to accept a scheme by which a certain percent-age of their salaries and wages will be reduced.     Thesetwo items will be in addition to the  50,000 which theKing has surrendered.
