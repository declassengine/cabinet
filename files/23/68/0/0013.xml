The Prime Minister, who had been detainedby an official engagement at Chequers and who arrivedsomewhat late,  informed the Cabinet in the course ofthe Meeting that on the evening of Friday, September18th, he had had to return to London from Chequersshortly after his arrival there, in order to meetrepresentatives of the Bank of England, who had reported a very serious situation owing to the eon-tinned heavy withdrawals from London.   On the following day the Bank of England had made formal applicationto be relieved of their obligation to sell gold underthe provisions of the Gold Standard Act, 1925.    It hadbeen necessary for him to take action expeditiouslyand with the utmost secrecy, and there had not been time to summon a Meeting of the full Cabinet.The Cabinet recognised the circumstances in which the Prime Minister had had toact on their behalf.ess Notice.2. While awaiting the arrival of the PrimeMinister his colleagues discussed informally a draftPress Notice which was circulated to them under instructions from the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Appendix I) ,   Their suggestions were endorsed, by thePrime Minister, and after his arrival other alterationswere made.The Cabinet agreed --(a) That the following modifications shouldbe made in the original draft (Appendix I):-Page 2, Line 8:    For the words &quot;parliament is considering the necessary legis-lation&quot; put &quot;Parliament is passing the necessary legislation&quot;.Page 3: For the first three lines, &quot;HisMajesty&apos;s Government are well aware that the present step is bound to have serious conse-quences both at home and abroad&quot;put &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have-arrived at their decision with thegreatest reluctance&quot;.(NQTEt    This suggestion, which at once
commended itself to the Cabinet,was received during the Meetingfrom the Treasury, who had beenin communication with the deputy governor of the Bank of England.)Page 3, Lines 5 and 6:    For the words&quot;seem bent on liquidating their foreign assets in a. spirit ofpanic&quot; put &quot;have, been liquidatingtheir sterling assets regardless of their intrinsic worth&quot; .Page 3, Line 7:    For &quot;the economy ofthis country&quot; put &quot;the finaneialposition of this country&quot;.Page 3, Lines 9 and 10:    For the words&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have secured, at the cost of painfulsacrifices. a balanced Budget&quot;,put &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare securing a balanced Budget&quot;.(b) To approve the draft Press Notice, subjectto the above amendments.(A copy of the Press Notice asactually issued is attached inAppendix II.)(c) That copies of the Press Notice shouldbe distributed to representatives of thePress, who were to be seen by the PrimeMinister, with whom were associated theLord. President of the Council, theChancellor of the Exchequer and theHome Secretary, immediately after theMeeting of the Cabinet^ and that a copyshould be sent to India.3. The Cabinet had before them a draft- of theGold Standard Bill, 1931, the object of which was to suspend the operation of Sub-section (2) of Section Oneof the Gold Standard Act, 1925, and for purposesconnected therewith.The Bill was examined by members of the cabinet before the arrival of the Prime Minister..The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thatall the necessary action had been taken to alter theOrder of Business of the House of Commons on thefollowing day in order to permit the passing ofthis urgent Bill through all its stages. arrangements had also been made for summoning the House of Lords
elegrams toepres entativesbroad and tohe Dominions .broadcastingfor the same purpose.    Pending the passing of the bill the Bank of England was covered by a letter from theTreasury dated September 19, 19 31.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the draft of the GoldStandard Bill, 1931, for submission to Parliament on the following day:(b) (Adopted later in the Meeting) Thatthe following names should be .placedon the back of the Bill:-4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that a telegram had been prepared for immediate despatch to British diplomatic representatives abroad and to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions.5. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had had under consideration the question fitbroadcasting by wireless a statement of a steadyingcharacter explaining the situation.   He took the viewthat,  on the whole, it would be advisable to securepublicity by means of the Press statement, which theCabinet had already approved, in Monday&apos;s newspapers,and to reserve the broadcast until Monday evening.Pie himself had undertaken on Monday evening to takethe Chair at a meeting at the Queen&apos;s Hall commemora-tive of Faraday, and his speech would be broadcast.The question arose, therefore, as to who shouldbroadcast the statement on the financial situation.The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the broadcast statement on thefinancial situation should be madeon the evening of Monday, September 21:
(b) That it would be advisable for thePrime Minister to keep his engagementto broadcast at the meeting commemora-tive of Faraday shortly after 8 p.m.:(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should broadcast on the financial situation at 9-15 p.m. and that his intention to do so should be announced in the Press .   The Chancellor of theExchequer said he would require froma quarter of an hour to twenty minutes.(MOTE:    The Prime Minister gaveinstructions to his private secretary to put in hand thenecessary arrangements at once.)iness of the 6.    The Prime Minister pointed out &quot;that these of Commons .events of the last 48 hours had created a new situa-f-R.,tion and it was necessary for the Cabinet to consxder7^&apos;)^&apos; whether it involved any modification in the businessof the House of Commons apart from the passage ofthe Gold Standard Bill,  1931.The Cabinet were reminded that among the argu-ments  justifying the Economy Bill, emphasis had been laid on the fact that prices were falling.   It had also been suggested in many speeches that if thecountry went off the gold standard prices would rise.It might therefore be represented in Parliament thatthe justification for the Economy Bill had passedaway, and the opposition to the various reductions in the pay of teachers, police, sailors, soldiers and airmen would be strengthened.   The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the main object of the economy Bill was to balance the Budget, and it was strongly urged that this position must be maintained.As mentioned in the Press Notice (Appendix II), therewas a great difference between going off the goldstandard with an unbalanced Budget accompanied byuncontrolled inflation, and taking this measure not
because of internal financial difficulties but because of excessive withdrawals of borrowed capital.immediatelyThere was no certainty that prices would rise^ andany rise in prices was likely to lag a good dealbehind any fall there might be in sterling.    It was urged that the Cabinet should not falter in their main policy.    It was suggested also that if prices should rise seriously at some later date it would bepossible to pass an Act to enable the Orders inCouncil to be varied.The Cabinet agreed  That the Government&apos;s programme ofbusiness should not be alteredowing to the new situation.
7.    The Cabinet were informed that, by agree-ment between the Gommittee of the Stock Exchange,the Bank of England and the Joint Stock Banks,the London Stock Exchange would be closed onMonday, September 21st.A message was read to the Cabinet from paris, dated September 20th, despatched 4.35 p.m.,(by telephone), stating that a letter to theChancellor of the Exchequer from the french minister of Finance was on its way by aircraft and that the Minister offered to co-operate inany measures which His Majesty&apos;s Government maybe contemplating.     M. flandin had stated thatif the London Stock Exchange was to be closed,they would do the same in Paris, and in that case ib would be desirable to secure the closing of other leading Stock Exchanges,  e.g., Berlin,Amsterdam.     M. Flandin did not want to close the Bourse, but would do so if desired.M. Flandin also thought that the closing ofthe market for forward transactions in poundssterling should be undertaken at once and suggestedthat the Bank of England should confer with theBank of France.The Treasury had reported to the Chancellorof the Exchequer that the Deputy Governor of theBank of England thought it a good plan to close the Stock Exchanges in Paris, Berlin andAmsterdam.     They reported that the Bank ofEngland would get into touch with the Bank ofFrance about the closing of the market for forwardtransactions in pounds sterling.
The Cabinet agreed  That appropriate action shouldbe taken for securing the closing of the Stock Exchangesin Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam andthat New York should be informed.
UTURE0L1OY.8.    The Gabinet discussed, in a preliminarymanner the effect, of falling off the gold standardon their future policy, and, while no decisions were taken,  the following subt  cts werementioned:-(i)  The importance of arriving in thenear future at a decision as to thepolicy to be adopted towards thevalue of the pound sterling;(ii) A proposal put forward by the PrimeMinister for consideration as tothe desirability of setting up aGommittee, including representativesof, for example,  the Bank ofEngland, the Joint Stock Banks,Lord Macmillan, some leadingeconomists, and labour rep resenta-tives,  to v/atch the situation from day to day and suggest appropriate action for steadying public opinion by combating fears, stimulatingconfidence, and explaining thesituation;(iii) What action should be taken to dealwith the inter1&quot;-, &quot;ional goldsituaJ&quot;&quot;on, s. this connection theCabint u wer:  informed that the Bank    of England had long desired a&apos;. &apos; conference of central banks on thefyfbi)b.     subject but had not been able tobring it about owing to oppositionon details mainly from New York and paris.      It was suggested that thepresent opportunity might be afavourable one to bring about aconference.The Chancellor of the Exchequerinformed the Cabinet that he was considering a oautious reference tothe matter in hi..    &quot;ee-v-. in the Houseof Commons.Another suggestion was that if theco-operation of the Bank of Prance andthe Federal Reser.6 Bank could notbe secured it was for consideration whether it would not be worth while to arrange a conf recommendation,.&quot; oe of othercentral banks.
The mobilisation of internationalsecurities, which was likely tobe raised in the House of Commons.The Chancellor of the exchequer said he had a very complete answer on this question;(v)  The desirability of close contact between the Bank of England, theJoint Stock Banks and industry in settling credit policy;(vi. Whether the purpose of the G-overn-ment was affected by the new situation.      The general opinion was that the Government were boundto remain in office to secure thep ound.
NEXT meeting of THECABINET.9.    The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had invited Ministers outside theCabinet to attend the meeting on the followingda^, at 11.30 a.m.,  in order that they mightbe apprised of the rapid developments of thelast 48 hours.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.20th September,  19JS1.

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetments that the Banks hoped to carry on business as usual,claim-It had been thought advisable, however, in case anypanic should occur, that powers should be made avail-able for proclaiming a bank holiday at the shortestnotice.    It had accordingly been arranged that aMeeting of the Privy Council should be held at Balmoralthe same afternoon, and that the necessary Proclamationsshould be signed to enable a bank holiday to be declaredif this was deemed necessary.   The Proclamations,however, would not be used except in emergency.   TheMeeting of the Privy Council would, he understood, notbe announced in the Court Circular before Tuesdaymorning, and, in accordance with the normal practice,the business of the Council wrould not be announced.He emphasised the importance of secrecy in this matter.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,September 20, 1931.
APPENDIX    I.PRESS NOTICE.His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided afterconsultation with the Bank of England that it has become necessary to suspend for the time being the operation of subsection (2)  of Section 1  of the Gold Standard Act of 1925which requires the Bank to sell gold at a fixed price.      ABill for this purpose will be introduced immediately and itis the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to as.  Parliamentto pass it through all its stages on Monday, 21st September.In the meantime the Bank of England have been aut ^rised toproceed accordingly in anticipation of the action of Parliament.The reasons which have led to this decision are asfollows.      Since the middle of July funds amounting to morethan  200 millions have been withdrawn from the London market.The withdrawals have been met partly from gold and foreign currency held by the Bank of England, partly from the proceeds of a credit of  50 millions which shortly matures secured bythe Bank of England from New York and Paris and partly fromthe proceeds of the French and American credits amounting to 80 millions recently obtained by the Government.      During thelast few days the withdrawals of foreign balances haveaccelerated so sharply that His Madesty&apos;s Government have felt, bound to take the decision mentioned above.This decision will of course not affect obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government or the Bank of England which are payable in foreign currencies.The gold holding of the Bank of England amounts tosome  130 millions and having regard to the contingencieswhich may have to be met it is.inadvisable to allow thisreserve to be further reduced.
There will be no interruption of ordinarybanking business.      The banks will be open as usualfor the convenience of their customers;    and thereis no reason why sterling transactions should beaffected in any way.It has been arranged that the Stock Exchangeshall not be opened on Monday, the day on which parliament is considering the necessary legislation.      This will not however interfere with the business of the currentsettlement on the Stock Exchanges which will be carried through as usual.His Majesty&apos;s Government have no reason tobelieve that the present difficulties are due to anysubstantial extent to the export of capital by british nationals.      Undoubtedly the bulk of the withdrawals havebeen for foreign account.      They desire however to repeat emphatically the warning given by the Chancellorof the Exchequer that any British citizen who increases the strain on the exchanges by purchasing foreign securities himself or assisting others to do so isdeliberately adding to the country&apos;s difficulties.      the banks have undertaken to co-operate in restrictingpurchases by British citizens of foreign exchange,, except those required for the actual needs of trade or for meeting existing contracts, and should further measuresprove to be advisable, His Majesty&apos;s Government willnot hesitate to take them.His Majesty&apos;s Government are well aware thatthe present step is bound to have serious consequencesboth at home and abroad.      3ut during the last few days the International financial markets have become demoralise
and seem ftent on liquidating their foreignassets in a spirit of panic.      In the circumstances there was no alternative but to protect the economy of this country by the only means at our disposal.His Majesty&apos;s Government have secured at thecost of painful sacrifice a balanced budget and theinternal position of the country is sound.      this position must be maintained.      It is one thing to go.offthe gold standard with an unbalanced. Budget and urieon-trolled inflation;    it is quite another thing to take this measure, not because of internal financial difficulties,but because of excessive withdrawals of borrowed capital.The ultimate resources of this country are enormous, andthere is no doubt that the present exchange difficulties will prove only temporary.TREASURY CHAMBERS,WHITEHALL,S.W.1.20th September, 1931

COPY.BANK OP ENGLAND,19th September, 193Gentlemen,I am directed to state that the credits for$125,000,000 and Fes.  3,100,000,000, arranged by the Bankof England in New York and Par-is respectively,  areexhausted, and that the credit for $200,000,000 arranged in New York by His Majesty&apos;s Government,  together withcredits for a total of Fes.  5 milliards negotiated inParis, are practically exhausted also.      The heavy demands for exchange on New York and Paris still continue.In addition the Bank are being subjected to a drain ofgold for Holland.Under these circumstances, the Bank considerthat, having regard to the above commitments and tocontingencies that may arise,  it would be impossible forthem to meet the demands for gold with which they wouldbe faced on withdrawal of support from the New York and paris exchanges.      The Bank therefore feel it their duty to represent that,  in their opinion,  it is expedient inthe national interest that they should be relieved oftheir obligation to sell gold under the provisions ofSection 1  subjection 2 of the Gold Standard Act,  1925.I am,Gentlemen,Your obedient Servant,.
