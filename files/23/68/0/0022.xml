The Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs recalled that there existedan initial agreement on the subject, but he undertook that before he took a final decisionhe would consult the Cabinet.-2-
1IARIES.previous reference:Cabinet 65(51), Gon-conclusion 3) ,F.R.3.   At the request of the Lord Chancellor theCabinet took note of the following Memorandum(c.p. 257 (31):-&quot;Having regard to the discussion which tookplace at the Cabinet on this matter,/   Ithink it desirable that the observationswhich follow should be placed on record.I do not in any way desire to contestthe decision reached by the Cabinet.The 20$ cut may be criticised on theground that it inflicts undue hardshipupon the individual judge;    and on theground that it will make it more difficulteven than it was before to maintain thehigh standard of the Bench when vacanciesoccur.But the principal ground for objection is, in my view, the fact that it is an infringement of a principle, which forms oneof the safeguards of the Constitution, thatthe position of the judge should be secure andunaffected by political movements.      Thereare grave reasons for the fear that to regard the position or salary of a judge as subjectto change without his consent by reason ofthe political necessities of the moment maylead to an inroad on the impartiality ofthe Bench.Sankey,&quot;
FUTUREGOVERNMENTPOLICY .(previous reference:Cabinet 68(31), Con-elusion 3.)f.R.4.   The Cabinet resumed consideration of thepolitical situation.In the absence of the Prime Minister, who wasfulfilling an urgent political engagement in his constituency, the Lord President of the Counciloccupied the Chair during the greater part of theMeeting, including the first part of the discussionreferred to in this Minute.   On the arrival, late in the Meeting, of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who had been engaged in the Chamber of the House ofCommons, the Lord President invited him, owing tohis more detached position in the matters at issue,to take the Chair,The Home Secretary reported that that morninghe had met the Liberal Ministers, and, later,  a meet-by mosting attended ? of the Liberal Members of Parliament.Following &apos;        these meetings he and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs submitted a variant ofpart of the formula prepared on the previous eveningby the Drafting Committee of the Cabinet, which hadbeen under consideration at the end of the meeting referred to in the margin.The formulae dealing with the crucial questionof tariffs, as submitted by the Drafting Committeeand by the Liberal Ministers respectively, aregiven below.    In order to show the setting in whichthe two formulae appear, the agreed parts of the drafting Committee&apos;s formula are also included.The two alternatives are shown in parallel columnsand continue straight on from the preceding passageafter the full-stop.&quot;In present conditions, while the reactions of our departure from the gold standard arestill obscure, it is impossible to specifyin detail the measxires which it may benecessary to take in order to solve these
problems.   But the Government, composed as it is of men of different Parties, whohave come together to try and serve theinterests of their country, appeal now totheir fellow countrymen and countrywomento trust them in this crisis, withouthampering them by pledges which would tietheir hands in this or that respect.   we ask for a mandate to carry through whateverplans may appear to us to be best adapted to effect the purposes we have described.We shall, if we receive such a mandate,exclude nothing beforehand.(Drafting C ommittee)We ask for power to dealwith and control imports,whether by prohibition,tariffs, or any other measures which may benecessary.(Lib era 1, Minis tersjStrong efforts should be madeto secure the lowering of tariff barriers abroad.    Ifit should be found necessary by the Government, havingregard to conditions nowprevailing, to restrict imports, we ask for power toadopt any measures which thesituation may require, whetherby prohibition, tariffs orotherwise.We recognise that in any case control ofotir imports would not provide a completesolution of our difficulties, and we placealso in the front rank of our aims theimprovement of our industrial and agricul-tural organisation, and the linking up, sofar as may be found possible, of our own home production with that of the othercountries of the Empire, in order to utilise to the full the whole resources ofthe British Commonwealth&quot; .The discussion of the two formulae  disclosed a difference between the point of view of the Conserva-tive and Liberal members of the Cabinet which it wasnot found possible to reconcile.The Conservative Ministers stated frankly thatthey considered the original words of the drafting committee did imply that the next Parliament would beexpected to effect the control of imports, whilstleaving the widest discretion as to the means bywhich such control should be exercised.   They furtherstated that they attached so much importance to thisimplication that they could not agree to the change proposed by their Liberal colleagues, which left open the question of whether imports should be dealt withand controlled by the next Parliament at all.-5-
The position of the Liberal members of theCabinet may be summed up as follows .   They had beenglad to co-operate in the effort to restore andsafeguard the public finances.    They considered thatthe Government should have continued with this work without any question of an early General Flectionhaving been raised.    If, however, the Prime Ministerdecided that a Dissolution was necessary, they wouldunanimously support him in an appeal to the nation to send to power a strong and stable Government drawn from men of all Parties     Should it prove to benecessary, in spite of the de-valuation of the  , toadopt exceptional measures in order to redress anyadverse balance of trade, they would support such measures without precluding any proposal that was likely to be effective.   To meet their Conservativecolleagues, however, they had gone further.   Greatlyagainst their will they had been prepared to ask fromthe electorate power for the next Parliament to dealwith imports not in relation to the balance of tradeonly, but generally also, as was shown by their draftformula (right-hand column above) .   They pointed outthat (as mentioned above) the Conservative ministers had made their position quite clear, that they couldnot accept any formula which failed to imply thatthere must and would be a restriction of imports bythe next Parliament, bo+b in respect (as they under-*stood the views of their Conservative colleagues)of the balance of trade and otherwise.    It was true that their Conservative colleagues did not insist that this restriction must necessarily be imposed by tariffs only.   Since, however, prohibi-tion of imports was known to be impracticable onaccount of Treaties, and no-one favoured Import Boards,and no other form of restriction of imports had been
suggested, the intention of the Conservative ministers could only be to deal with the matter by tariffs.The Liberal Leaders pointed out, therefore, thatthey were to be required to call upon their followersto vote for a Government and a Parliament which waspledged to introduce tariffs.    In other words, insteadof the National Government going to the country tosecure a mandate to complete its present work and toprevent the Opposition coming into power, theElection would be fought also on the Tariff issue,with the Liberal Leaders supporting that policy.They had not entered the National Government on anysuch understanding, and they felt strongly that theyshould not be put in the position of appearing torefuse to/maintain unity for the reason that they objected tothis policy.The question was discussed in all its aspects,from the point of view of the position that would,arise in the constituencies during the Election, aswell as from that of the working of the alternativeformulae after a National Government had been returned to power, and prolonged efforts were madeto reconcile the two points of view.   At one pointan adjournment was made for twenty minutes with thisobject.    It was not found possible, however, to break the deadlock.. In adjourning at 5 p.m. the Cabinet agreed  (a) To instruct the Secretary to reportthe resrflts of the discussion andthe respective points of view of theLiberal and Conservative members ofthe Cabinet to the Prime Ministerimmediately on his return from his constituency:(b) That, pending the return of the PrimeMinister, no^statement should be madeto the Press by or on behalf of anymember of the Cabinet.
Having regard to the intensestrain at which the Prime minister had had to work during the last fewdays, the Cabinet refrained fromany recommendation that a meeting should be summoned on Saturday orSunday.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 2, 1931.
