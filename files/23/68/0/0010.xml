Mpply BYmim^is ofMUTTONIvse IIIU PAMPHLETS,A .    The Gabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.  229 (3*0) raising the questioniof the supply by Government Departments of information for use in Party pamphlets.      The Memorandum wasoccasioned by the fact that shortly before the HomeSecretary&apos;s predecessor left office a communicationwas received at the Home Office from the Press and publicity Department of the Labour Party asking for a&quot;Statement on the work and accomplishments of theHome Office&quot; for publication in a Party pamphlet.It was stated that for many years past it has beenthe practice of the Department to supply such information for use in Party literature.    The presentconditions appeared to offer a good opportunity forlaying down a rule, or at least creating a precedent,that such information should not be given, if thatwas the opinion of the Cabinet.      On the other hand,a Minister might be considered entitled to ask forinformation as to the work of his own Departmentto be prepared and to put it to such use as he might think desirable.The Cabinet accepted the viewof the Home Secretary as set forth in CP. 229 (31) and summarisedaliove.

The Cabinet had before them correspondence between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePostmaster-General (CP.-235 (31)), circulated atthe request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,reporting the result of the Postmaster-General1snegotiations on behalf of the British Governmentwith the British Broadcasting Corporation on thesubject of economies.    The British broadcasting corporation were willing to forgo, out of theirproportion of the revenue from Wireless Licencesunder the scale now in force,  50,000 by March 31,19 32, and a further  150,000 in the course of thefollowing financial year 1932-33.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer, in a letter dated September 14,19 31f agreed with the Postmaster-General that theoffer was a generous one, and undertook to give hisfull support to the recommendation that it should beaccepted by the Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised thatthe May Committeefs recommendation, which envisageda large saving by the granting of a government guarantee of the British Broadcasting Corporationscapital expenditure in order to enable them to borrow-over an extended period of years, was not includedin the present arrangement, and that the british broadcasting Corporation will not postpone theirintended commencement of overseas broadcasting andwill not ask for additional revenues to finance it.The Cabinet expressed satisfaction atthe arrangement concluded by thePostmaster-General with the british broadcasting Corporation, as set forth in C.P.-235 (31) and summarised above,and gave it their approval.
IIeague OP NATIONS       3. The Cabinet discussed with the Secretary ofBritish Repre-gentation at.ifprevious&quot;reference:nabinet 481(31), con-conclusion 4.)V.State for Foreign Affairs the question of whetherthe latter could possibly manage to pay a short visit to Geneva during the present Session of the Assembly.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that it would he very difficult for him to leaveLondon during the present state of affairs and that a visit would be mainly a matter of courtesy.   It hadto be remembered also that the mere fact of hisannouncing a visit would raise hopes and expectationsthat could hardly be justified by the event.It was suggested that a visit from the foreign secretary would be much appreciated.   Provided thedate were notified beforehand, a special Meeting ofthe Assembly would probably be arranged.   The foreign secretary could reaffirm the announced intention ofthe Government to support the meeting of the Disarma-ment Conference in February;   he could make a friendlyreference to Signor Grandi&apos;s proposal for a holidayin armaments and to the Scandinavian resolution:   hecould explain the aims and intensive activities ofthe National Government, and say a strong word aboutthe maintenance of the   sterling.The Prime Minister summed up the view of theCabinet that if the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs did find it possible to leave his importantwork at home it would be an advantage for him to visitGeneva;   but the matter was left to the Secretary ofState&quot;s discretion.
