HE CIRCUMSTANCESN WHICH THEOVSRNMENT HASSEN FORMED.-1.    The Prime Minister opened the meeting ofMinisters by expressing his deep obligation tohis colleagues, who had come forward to help the country out of its present difficulties.Although they were accustomed to sit on oppositesides in Parliament, he hoped that they would now co-operate and show   forbearance one toanother, thus forming an effective co-operativebody.      There&apos; would no doubt be difficultiesbut means must be found for solving them.     he recalled that at Buckingham Palace he had stated that so far as he was concerned he wouldbe handicapped by the fact that the vast proportion,of his Party not only would not support the new government but would be in opposition.      He would,however, do his best as an individual and thisformerapplied to those of his / colleagues who were nowMembers of the present Government.At a later stage of the meeting the FirstLord of the Admiralty expressed his appreciation of the line taken by the Prime Minister andthose of his colleagues in the present government who had been Members of the late Government.His own colleagues and the Members of the liberal party who had entered the Government had had totake a decision rather different from whatanyone had expected.      They had staked everythingand nothing could justify their attitude exceptsuccess a      As one who would not be present atthe meetings of the Cabinet he ventured to saythat it would be necessary to overwhelm all
opposition.      That could, only be accomplished byboldness in execution.      He would therefore always be inclined to support larger rather thansmaller measures.The Home Secretary also paid a tribute tothe Prime Minister and his colleagues who hadbeen Members of the late Government, and emphasised the courage and public spirit theyhad shown.      He thought this would be recognised by the nation at large and history would endorsetheir attitude.      He expressed&apos; appreciation ofthe action of the Lord President of the Councilin serving with a Prime Minister whose views had been different from his own in many matters,as well as that of the Pirst Lord of theAdmiralty and other Ministers who had put allother considerations aside in the interests ofpublic security.The Lord President of the Council saidthat he and his colleagues would do their best.
2.    The Prime Minister said, that the chiefpurpose of the Government was to deal withthe financial situation.      Those of his colleagwho had been in touch with him during the last fortnight were informed upon the subject, butin order that all might understand theexisting difficulties he would ask theChancellor of the Exchequer to open with astatement.The Chancellorrof the Exchequer then made a full statement of the prospectivedeficit during the current year and the next financial year, and gave particulars of themeasures of economy contemplated by the late government.      This statement will be circulated as a separate document.The Chancellor of the Exchequer addedthat at noon that day the news from the Bankof England had been satisfactory.      Up to midnight on the previous evening the bankersin the United States of America had insisted that Prance should join in the loan whichhad now become necessary.     At first therehad been some reluctance on the part of theFrench bankers, but now it seemed that theywere becoming more reasonable.     Officials fromthe Treasury were proceeding to Paris to-day todiscuss questions relating to the rate ofinterest and so forth.
The Prime Minister gave particulars ofcertain negotiations that had taken place betweenthe late Government and representatives of theBank of England, who had found it necessary to consult confidentially the President of theUnited States Federal Reserve Bank on the subjectof the conditions precedent to a loan.
LBIKETtOCEDURE.3,    The Prime Minister mentioned that his usualcustom was to begin meetings precisely at thepre-arranged time.     He appealed for punctualityin attendance.He also instructed the Secretary asfollows:-(a) To circulate as soonas poss ible, as has been customaryon the formation of each new administration since the War, a memorandum setting out existing Cabinetproc edure;(b) To circulate to all the ministers present at this meeting theMinutes of all meetings of theGabinet as well as the AgendaPapers.      This would enable ministers who were outside theCabinet to notify if their Depart-ments were concerned with anysubject on the Agenda Paper and toraise for consideration any question on which they required a cabinet decision.He asked Ministers to do their best tokeep in touch with the Cabinet and with one another, and to inform.him if there was anyquestion of difficulty arising in theadministration of their respective Departments.The Prime Minister added that, while itmight be desirable to hold occasional meetingsof all Ministers, he thought that the Cabinetitaelf should take all decisions.This was generally agreed to be[Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1!&apos;?J 2$th August, 1931.
