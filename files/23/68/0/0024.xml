THE EINGTSSPEECH.(previous reference:Cabinet 70(31), Con-elusion 2 .)1.   Tlie Cabinet Had before tliem a second reviseof the draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the prorogation of Parliament (CP.-261 (31))  (Appendix) .The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that theKing had approved the draft.The Cabinet desired to suggest no alteration inThe King&apos;s Speech as accepted by His Majesty.-1-
ECONOMY.nationalIns urano e(national economy)(No.2) Order,1931.(previous reference:Cabinet 67(31), Con-clusion 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP.-260 (31)) covering adraft of the Order in Council, mentioned in the margin,to be made under the Economy Act, together with an explanatory Memorandum.    In the Memorandum it was explained that, in accordance with the White Paper(Cmd. 3952) the Order limits Insurance Benefit to 26weeks in the benefit year, applies to transitional payments a needs test to be operated by the PublicAssistance Authorities, and provides that any deficiency in the Insurance Account of the Unemployment insurance fund should be made good by the Exchequer.The Cabinet considered whether it might not be inthe public interest to postpone for a short time themaking of this Order.   They were informed, however,that in any event the Order would probably not comeinto operation before November 12th, and that everyweek&apos;s delay would involve a loss of  200,000.    Inthese circumstances delay was considered inadvisable.The Cabinet invited the Minister of Health andthe Minister of Labour to consider the inclusion inthe Regulations, which would follow the Order in.Council, of a general direction that the interviewingby Public Assistance Committees of applicants forTransitional Benefit should not take place in a.Poorhaw institution, unless in exceptional cases .   Theywere further invited to consider whether suchexceptional cases could be made subject to the specialpermission of the Minister, and the Minister of Healthundertook to see what could be done to meet the views expressed.
The Minister of Labour was also asked to considerwhether it was practicable to make any ameliorationof the instruction as to the enquiries to be made regarding the circumstances of applicants forTransitional payments set forth in paragraph 1 (4)of the draft Order in Council.    The Minister of Labour,however, did not think anything could be done in thisdirection, as the terms of the Order are based on previous announcements contained in the White paper or in statements made in Parliament.Subject to the above, the Cabinet agreed  To approve that the draft Order inCouncil attached to CP.-260 (31)should be made as soon as possible.
DISARMAMENTPOLICY.Procedure.(previous reference:Cabinet 62(31), Con-elusion 5.)f.R.7^(3,) 6.3.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary (0.&apos;;P*-S63 (31)) on the subject of theprocedure to be adopted during the Election in connec-tion with the preparations for the DisarmamentConference.The Cabinet also had before them the following papers that had been circulated:-Resolutions adopted by the Three-Party Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence (CP.-207 (31)).A Despatch from Lord Tyrrell, enclosinga French Memorandum on the DisarmamentConference (CP .-236 (31)) which hadbeen communicated by M. Briand to theSecretary of State on July 15th andsubsequently published.A Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty on the Political Aspects ofthe French Memorandum (CP.-227 (31)).As all the Ministers concerned who are Membersof the House of Commons would be absent in their constituencies during the General Election, theCabinet agreed -(a)(b)That an Interdepartmental Committee,composed of officers and officials who have worked with the Sub-Gommittee of the Committee ofImperial Defence, and/or such other representatives as theMinisters at the head of theDepartments concerned may designate,should form a Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence tocontinue the work of preparation for the Disarmament Conference inits interdepartmental aspects;That Mr. Alex Cadogan of the ForeignOffice, or in his absence some other member of the Sub-Committee, should act as Chairman.-A-
ADMIRALTY 4.    The First Lord of the Admiralty made aECONOMIES.report to the Cabinet as to the results of enquiries(Previous in the Home Ports into the recent unrest in the reference:Gabinet 6&quot;2 Atlantic Fleet, following the reductions in(31), Con-clusion 6). naval pay;    and as to forthcoming movements of; the Fleet.-5-
IMPERIAL war graves COM-MISSION.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(31), Con-clusIon 19 .)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that, as promised at the Meeting referred toin the margin, he had looked into the question of the contribution to the Imperial War Graves Commission.While he did not suggest any alteration in the sumpaid annually for the maintenance of the Imperial war graves, he thought that in the present financial situation, especially when the  2,500,000 to be found from miscellaneous economies was still far from com-plete, it was only right that the annual contribution of  300,000 towards the Endowment Fund (which hadalready been paid for the current finane financial year)should be suspended for the next two or three years.This would not affect the upkeep of the War Graves,which was provided for by the sum paid for their maintenance.   The Chairman of the Imperial War graves commission and the First Commissioner of Works, whois a member, were reported in the circumstances tohave approved this proposal.The Cabinet were informed that the Dominionsattached the utmost importance to the completion ofthe Endowment Fund.   They had already paid up thewhole of their share of the capital of  5,000,000.Australia, notwithstanding the financial embarrass-arrangements of the present year, had paid her final contri-bution.   Canada and other Dominions had done the same.A default on this payment would, It was suggested,be regarded as a breach of faith in the Dominionsand might be badly received at home.   In addition,the French Government had at times expressed doubt as to whether successive Governments would be willingto maintain the cemeteries, but had been reassuredby the decision to create the Endowment Fund.
It was suggested, however, that it was not impossi-ble that the representatives of the Dominions on theImperial War Graves Commission might make a spontaneousoffer to hand back the whole, or the greater part,of the annual contribution to the United Kingdom.The Cabinet invited the Secretary ofState for War, as Chairman of theImperial War Graves Commission, totake such steps as he thought best-to ascertain whether this coursewould commend itself to the Commis-sion, which was to meet on thefollowing :afternoon.
CABINET ARRANGE-MENTS during a GENERALELECTION.(previous reference:Cabinet 18(29), Con-elusion 9 .)6.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary (C.P.-262 (31)) containing a description of the procedure adopted during the last three Genera]Elections for the transaction of Cabinet business during the period of the Election.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Committee composed of -The Prime Minister (for major questionsonly),The Lord Chancellor,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for India,The President of the Board of Trade,together with any other members ofthe Cabinet who might be available,and other Ministers according tothe nature of the business, witha representative of the treasury in attendance -should form a nucleus(i) for handling Cabinet business during the Election, includingquestions of principle submittedby candidates to the party organisations:(ii) to make such arrangements as itmight think best for establishingliaison with the Party Organisa-tions concerned:(iii) to deal with ordinary cabinet business during the Election,unless it is of such importance as to render necessary the summoning of the full Cabinet.(b) That no attempt should be made to arrange with the Opposition Party for the reduc-tion in the number of questionnaires tobe answered by candidates.
7.   The President of -the Board of Trade drew theattention of the Cabinet to the large amount of export credits being given to Russia, and the dimensions ofthe potential commitment assumed by the Treasury,which gave some cause for misgiving in view of theRussian adverse balance of trade during the last sixmonths and the world-wide economic and financial crisis.The Export Credits Guarantee Department was now working to a limit of  11,000,000 of credits toRussia.   The Parliamentary Secretary to the Departmentof Overseas Trade considered that this figure shouldnot be exceeded.    If our hands had been free it wouldhave been desirable to put pressure on Russia to use the credits she obtained here from sales of her produce to finance her requirements instead of granting credits.The Government&apos;s hands, however, were not free.   Thelate Government had entered into a quasi engagement to finance by means of export credits, 2 to 2^ years&apos;duration an engineering programme of  6,000,000 for russia.    Some  4,000,000 of commitments had alreadybeen entered on, and some firms had begun work on contracts in confident anticipation that credits wouldbe granted out of the remaining  2,000,000.   When the 6,000,000 credit was exhausted the aggregate export credits to Russia would total  12,000,000.   He suggestedthat the Export Credits Department and the AdvisoryCommittee should be instructed that as soon as thelimit of  12,000,000 had been reached, in view of theworld financial and economic situation, the length of credit to be given to any country should not exceed12 months.   This would apply to all countries, andwould not be directed specifically against Russia.

Thelate Government had entered into a quas1 engagement to of .finance by means of export credits/S to 2^ years&apos;duration an engineering programme of  6,000,000 for russia.    Some  4,000,000 of commitments had alreadybeen entered on, and some firms had begun urork on contracts in confident anticipation that credits wouldbe granted out of the remaining  2,000,000.   When the 6,000,000 credit was exhausted the aggregate export credits to Russia would total  12,000,000.

This would apply to all countries, andwould not be directed specifically against Russia.
The President of the Board of Trade also suggestedthat it would be necessary in the near future to reconsider the whole basis of trade between thiscountry and Russia.   Russia sold here for cash three or four times as much as she bought here on credit,and it was well worth considering whether future trade between the two countries could not be directly related .He would like authority to request the Department of overseas Trade to consider whether a scheme for relatingRussian sales to Russian purchases could be devised.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported theproposal of the President of the Board of Trade.   Hehad considerable apprehensions as to the extent ofthese credits to Russia.   The world economic situation was deteriorating, and he felt it was a heavy risk to&apos;carry.    Consequently he agreed with the President ofthe Board of Trade that there should be no extensionon the 2^5 years basis beyond the existing obligations.It appeared improbable that Russia could obtain&apos;herrequirements elsewhere on the basis of long-term creditsas Germany was not in a position to give them.   Mr Ford,who had undertaken very large contracts for Russia,had informed him that he had never given more than ten months&apos; credit.    In spite of the long credit terms wehad given, we had a large adverse balance Of tradewith Russia, whereas the United States had a favourabletrade balance.    The Russians were using the money theyobtained here from the sale of produce of various kindsto obtain Dollar Credits .After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of the Presidentof the Board of Trade, supported by theChancellor of the Exchequer, that on thecompletion of the credit scheme of 6,000,000 of engineering work for russia the length of the&quot;export creditsaccorded to Russia and other countries should be limited to twelve months:-10-
(b) To authorise the President of theBoard of Trade to request theDepartment of Overseas Trade tosubmit a scheme on -the lines indicated above.-il-
