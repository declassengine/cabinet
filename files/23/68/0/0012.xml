The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that,as he had mentioned at the Meeting of the cabinet referred to in the margin, he had, in conjunction withthe Committee on the Financial Situation, met Sir- ErnestEarvey (the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England)and Mr Peacock that afternoon.    The bankers had reported a deterioration in the financial situationdue to an increase in the withdrawals from Londonduring the last few days.   While the causes for thewithdrawals were difficult to establish with certainty,the bankers attributed them in the main to the followingreas ons(l) Lack of confidence of foreign nationals intheir own financial position.    In this connectionthere were rumo\irs that night of the failure of banksabroad and of serious financial difficulties inAmsterdam.(2) The adverse balance of trade.   On this point,however, it had not been possible to establish anrates ofassured figure.    Estimates varied from/ 50 millions to  100 millions a year, but there was great uncer-tainty.    For deposits and sterling bills held inLondon on foreign account the bankers gave a prelim-inary estimate of  350 millions as compared with theestimate of  407.1 millions contained in theMacmillan Report (Cmd.3897,page 42).   Neither of thesefigures, however, included foreign banks, and the Bankof England had not as yet been able to ascertain theextent of their holdings.(3) The recent Naval unrest in the AtlanticFleet .(4) An internal flight from the  .   There wasnot much visible flight;    that is to say, very little
was &quot;being done through the Joint Stock Banks .   there might, however, &quot;be a certain amount invisible, con-ducted through foreign banks .    One foreign financialinstitution had reported that it was doing businessof this kind.(5) The risk of a General Election.   The bankerssaid that the financial world had been a good dealupset when a statement had been made that the national government was only to be short-lived.The representatives of the Bank of England hadbeen firmly of opinion that the efforts to maintainthe   sterling must be continued.   This raised thequestion of the steps to be taken if the withdrawalsshould continue at a high rate and exhaustion of theexisting Credits were threatened.    It was realisedto be of great importance, if a General Electionshould take place, that the   sterling should be securewhile it was being held.  .   This opened up the questionwhether further Credits should be sought.The representatives of the Bank had pointed outthat the United States of America and Prance both had great interest in maintaining the   sterling.   Theposition in the United States, however, was not very strong.    A good deal of effort had been requiredin order to raise the American share of the recent 80 millions Credit.   The French were known to havelarge sums deposited in London, and these were reportedrecently to have been increased.   They were held partly by the Bank of Prance and partly by the French Govern-ment.   The French, therefore, who had already showedmuch good will, had every possible interest to maintainsterling.   The bankers had also emphasised the world-wide reactions which would follow if we went off theGold Standard, and had quoted in particular the commitments of the Irish Free State and Egypt.
They had explained that if further Credits were to besought in order to make sure of the period of aGeneral Election, it would be necessary to explain the whole position frankly to the Americans and theFrench not only in its financial but also in its political aspects .   This had opened up the questionof the conditions in which an Election, if held atall, should be held.While disclaiming any right to an opinion on political events, the representatives of the Bank,when pressed as to their view of what the american and French banking interests would be likely toconsider would provide sufficient security for furtherCredits, had indicated that a General Election inwhich the three Parties were acting independentlywould not be regarded as providing sufficient certaintyfor the establishment of a stable Government as theresult.   An appeal to the electorate by a national government on a national policy devised to rectifythe financial situation was more likely to be regardedfavourably abroad.   Mr Peacock had expressed the viewthat, as a policy of perfection, it would be preferable for the National Government to remain in office todeal with the balance of trade, and that an announce-ment of this intention would, in his view, do muchto restore confidence.   The risk had been pointed out to him, however, that by remaining long in office the Government might become unpopular, and doubts asto its stability and as to its ultimate success atthe polls might again upset.confidence.Notwithstanding their proved good will, and inspite of the strong interest that the United Statesand France had in maintaining the   sterling, the
representatives of the Bank of England had saidthat to obtain fresh Credits was not an easy matter,and had urged that if such Credits were desired the initiative should be taken by the government through the appropriate channels.    In any event,  inview of the assistance which the United States and france had given, and of the commitments they hadin London^  it was, they considered, essential togive them warning of the present trend of events.As there is a possibility of a further Creditbeing required if withdrawals continue at theirpresent rate, and particularly if a General Electionshould be considered necessary, the Cabinet proceeded to discuss the subject.    It was arranged that thequestion should be further explored on the following morning by the Prime Minister, the Lord President ofthe Council and the Home Secretary.At the end of the Meeting the Chancellor of theExchequer received a message from Sir Ernest Harveyreferring to reports of a serious financial crisis in Holland and asking that no communication shouldbe made to the American and French Governments onthe subject of further Credits,  etc., until the morning, when the effects of these fresh events couldbe weighed.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,September 17, 1931.
