1 VJ- *31.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had nothing to bring to theattention of the Gabinet.
1 d op;0POSALtelief toxpenditurecurred inevelopment.previous reference:cabinet 54SI), Con-conclusion o).2.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that a difficulty had arisen in regardto the Cabinet&apos;s decision to increase the allowancesnow made for depreciation of plant and machinery andto take a more liberal view in future of allowances for obsolescence.      Parliamentary Counsel had expressed the vie?r that the Speaker might rule that legislation giving effect to this decision couldnot be included in this Finance Bill on the groundthat these allowances to industry would not comeinto operation until April next, i.e. not in thecurrent financial year.     Such a ruling, if it weregiven, would not prevent him from making theannouncement of policy, nor would it affect theproposal itself, but it would mean that the actuallegislation would have to wait for the next finance bill.
j.     The Gabinet had. before them a revised draft of the White Paper on the measures proposedby His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure reductions in national expenditure,  (Paper No.  C.P.  223 (31)).The attention of the Cabinet was called tothe following clause on page 10 of the white paper:-51 (3) A limitation of insurance benefit(as distinct from transitional payments)  to 26 weeks in a benefityear /or 59 weeks without a freshwaiting period/, after which a freshinsurance qualification would berequired.&quot;The question was raised as to whether theCabinet desired the inclusion of the words in square brackets which are underlined above.The matter was found to be somewhattechnical, and, at the request of the Minister ofLabour, Mr. T.W. Phillips,  the Deputy Secretary tothe Ministry of Labour, was introduced and invitedto explain the matter.Mr. Phillips said that the limitation of insurance benefit to 26 weeks in the benefit year would leave untouched a considerable number ofcases in which,  owing to short-time or casualworking,  just short of 26 weeks of benefit is drawnevery year.     A short-time worker, for example,employed approximately half-time -would always satisfy the 30 contributions qualification for insurance benefit and might draw (say)  25 weeks of benefit in one benefit year;    having drawn less than 26weeks he could draw (say)  25 weeks in the nextbenefit year;    and so on indefinitely.      A similar
case would be that of a docker drawing on the averagejust short of three days benefit each week.The &quot;39 weeks&quot;  limitation was designed to coversuch cases.      It would be additional to the &quot;26 weeks in a benefit year&quot;  limitation.      Its effect would bethat when a person, who had not drawn as much as 26weeks of benefit in any one benefit year, reached atotal of 39 weeks of benefit without a fresh &quot;waitingperiod&quot;, he would cease to be entitled to insurance benefit until he requalified.      A fresh waiting periodbecomes necessary if there is a gap of more than 10weeks in the unemployment record,     Accordingly, ifsuch a gap occurred before the total of 39 weeksbenefit was reached,  the person concerned would on making a fresh claim start again with a clean sheetso far as this limitation is concerned.The Cabinet were informed that the measuresof economy proposed in the White Paper were on many points identical with those contemplated bythe late Government,  and it was generally agreed that,in the absence of over-riding considerations to thecontrary, there were political advantages in thiscontinuity.After hearing the explanations of the Ministerof Labour and Mr. Phillips, it was not felt that theaddition of the words in square brackets would bring such over-riding advantages.      Their omissionwould not affect the amount of the saving which theMinister of Labour hoped to obtain, beyond reducingthe margin for errors In estimating.      In any event,the question of Unemployment Insurance would have to
be dealt with before long by whatever Governmentwas in office, and no great harm would be doneby leaving this point until then.After decisions had been taken on thepoints mentioned below,  the Cabinet were informedthat there was a minor point about Army Reservesremaining for settlement, but that the Treasury,in consultation with the War Office,  felt able tosettle the point without troubling Ministers.The Cabinet agreed --(a) To omit the words in square brackets&quot;or 39 weeks without a freshwaiting period&quot; from page 10,clause (3)  and from page 13?paragraph 5 (3)  0^ the draft white Paper;(b) To take note that the passage relatingto Police (page 13, paragraph 4), hadbeen drafted in the Home Office, hadreceived the approval of the Secretaryof State, was non-controversial, and did not require a decision by theCabinet;(c) That the paragraphs relating to theRoad Fund (page 13, paragraph 6)should be retained in preference to.&apos;, &apos; the revised draft circulated as- part of the Secretary&apos;s coveringnote to CP.  223 (31) ;(d) That, subject to the above and to anyminor or drafting alterations,  thedraft White Paper attached to cp. 223 (31) should be approved for circulation to Parliament;NOTE:-   The Secretary was asked tosuggest to the Treasury thatthe headings of the various items should be printedin heavier type.
ECONOMY if.    The Cabinet agreed  BILL.(a) That the Economy Bill should be circulated at the same time as the(previous White Paper,   that is to say, afterReference: the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;cabinet 5if speech on the financial&apos; proposals, Con- on Thursday,  September 10th.elusion if) .(b) That on Friday, September 11th,  thePARLIAMENTARY                             Prime Minister should introducePROCEDURE. &quot;the Economy Bill,  the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and for(Discussed at the Colonies should speak towards a later stage the end of the Debate, and that on of the Meeting). Monday, .14*th September,  the HomeSecretary&quot; should speak,  (unless hedesires to suggest some other speaker),and that the Minister of Health shouldwind up the Debate.    Further that the attorney-General should be ready to speak in the Debate,  either onFriday or on Monday.
jgS LONDONPASSENGER5SANSPORT BILL.previous reference:Cabinet 4-8(51), Con-elusion J) ,ft.5.   The Gabinet had before them a DepartmentalMemorandum by the Ministry of Transport,  (PaperNo. G.P.  214- (J1)) * circulated on the instructions of the Prime Minister,  on the subject of theLondon Passenger Transport Bill.After it had been discussed mainly onthe political aspects of the question,  the cabinet agreed    (a) To leave the Bill on the list of measures which might be dealtwith during the present Sessionof Parliament;(b) That the Prime Minister should see Mr. Morrison at an early date and inform him that if more time than two days was required for thepassage of the remaining stages of the Bill through the House ofCommons,  it would be dropped;(c) That the President of the Board ofTrade should get in touch withcertain interests with whom he hadbeen in communication on the subject;(d) That the question should be brought up at the next meeting of theCabinet.
6.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,(Paper No. CP. 212 (;31)),  on the Statute of westminster,  covering a copy of the draft Bill.In this Memorandum the history of the question was set forth in detail and explanations weregiven as to the reasons for the various provisions.It was mentioned that one point in connectionwith the drafting of the Bill, namely, the precise form of Clause 9, which deals with theposition in Australia as between the commonwealth and the States, was still outstanding.      Telegraphicommunications were passing with the australian government, who are consulting with the StateGovernments, and it was hoped that a satisfactory agreement would shortly be reached on the basisof the Clause as now drafted.      The Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs now asked for theauthority of his colleagues for the introductionof the Bill into Parliament as soon as possiblein the forthcoming Session, with the object ofsecuring its passage, in accordance with therecommendation of the Imperial Conference of 1930,by the 1st December next.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs gave explanations and answered questions as to thescope of the Bill. An undertaking hadbeen given that the Bill would be passed by december 1st, because the Irish Free State
representatives at the Imperial Conference had expressedgreat anxiety that the Bill should become law before the General Election in Ireland, which it wasthen thought might take place at the beginning of1932.      Ke now understood that the General Electionwas not expected to take place until the middle ofthe year, and if so there was not the same urgency fromthis point of view, and in the last resort it wouldseem to suffice if the Bill were passed into law atthe end of December.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Statute of Westminstershould remain on the list of bills to be passed into law if possibleduring the present Session ofParliament, and that advantage should be taken of any opportunitythat might present itself in theParliamentary time-table for passingit through its various stages;(b) That the agreement as to BritishCommonwealth merchant shipping shouldbe signed by the time the Billreceives the Royal Assent,since the agreement pre-supposes thatit should come into operation atthe same time as the Statute of westminster;    and that the Secretaryof State for Dominion affairs should take such steps as he might think advisable to secure thatthere should be no delay insignature.
BILL TO renew the prolongation of INSURANCE ACT.,(previous reference:Cabinet 50(;1), Con-clusion 1 ) .7^)1.7.    As it was not essential that this Billshould be passed into law before December 31st,the Cabinet invited the Minister of Health toconsider whether it must be introduced duringthe present Session, or could be left over until a later Session of Parliament.-10-
EXPIRING LAWSCONTINUANCEBILL.(previous reference-:Cabinet 66(50),  Con-elusion 1lf) .8.   As the Expiring Laws Continuance Billneed not be passed before December 31st, thesubject was left over for the present.-11-
PUBLIC WORKS 9.    The Cabinet were informed that theL0AIIS BILL.Public Works Loans Bill was down for discussion(previous the same evening and might possibly be reference:Cabinet 34 taken.

^rjcATIONAL 11 .    The Secretary of State for Scotland*d0smentsSCOTLAND ) BILL. explained to the Cabinet that many endowmentsin Scotland were being wastefully administered,(previous reference: and a Commission had been established to cabinet 40(31), Con- consolidate them and turn them to better use.conclusion 17).The Commission had done most admirable work, but unless the statutory powers under which it workedwere extended,  would come to an end this year.In that event it would be necessary to dismissthe staff, although it was almost certain thatin a new Parliament the work would have to be started again.     He was, therefore, most reluctant to interrupt it,  even though the cost was 4,100 a year.      He thought the Bill was not likelyto prove controversial.     The Bill consisted of only one operative clause and was down for second reading.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forScotland should make enquiries asto whether the Bill was likely tomeet with opposition, and, in .the contrary event, should beauthorised to introduce it duringthe present Session of Parliament.

SUPPLY A LTDTRANSPORTCOMMITTEE.previous&apos; Reference:Cabinet 54-(31), Con-clusion -11)a.17,    After hearing a statement by the HomeSecretary, the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Supply and transport committee, which had existed underpervious Governments, bere-constituted as follows:-The Home Secretary (Chairman),The President of the Board of Trade,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Transport,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,The Secretary for Mines,The Chief Civil Commissioner(Minister to be appointed).(b) That the Government Departmentsconcerned should, under thegeneral co-ordination of theCommittee, bring up-to-date thearrangements with which theCommittee deals, but that no action should be taken involvingpublicity;(c) That the Committee should considerthe appointment of a Chief civil commissioner (the Cabinet were reminded that Sir WilliamMitchell -Thomson had been Chief civil commissioner under a previous government).

19.   The Lord President of the Council said that hehad heard that a proposal had been made for some reduction In the United kingdom s contribution tothe expenditure of the War Graves Commission.     he recalled that similar proposals had been made in thepast, and he reminded the Cabinet that they hadinvariably been rejected, and that very strong feeling,both in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions, was liable to be aroused by any such suggest ions.     TheChancellor of the Exchequer undertook to look into thequestion In the light of the short discussion thattook place.
20.      The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Air on Future Airship Policy,(Paper No.  CP. 222f (jji)).      In this Note the Secretaryof State formulated in detail the precise nature ofhis proposals in regard to future airship policy, sincethe statement made in the House of Commons on the12fth May, which was quoted in the Gabinet Minutereferred to in the margin, did not contain details ofthe more modest policy.which the Cabinet had adopted.The first point dealt with in the Note was inconnection with the future of the airship bases atCardington and overseas.     After reference to proposals he had made to the late Cabinet,  the Secretary of Statestated that, in the absence of directions to thecontrary, he would assume that the intention of theCabinet was that Cardington and the overseas basesare to be retained for the time being on a minimum&quot;care and maintenance&quot; basis, and not disposed of,The Note also raised the question of the mannerin which the new policy was to be announced.      Themethod which the Secretary of State preferred was thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer should make briefmention of the matter in his speech outlining themeasures of economy upon which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave decided;    but if this did not commend itself,he suggested that a Question should be arranged in the lords or Commons which would be dealt with on the linesof   a    draft Question and Answer attached to the Note.After- a shox-t discussion with the Secretary ofState for Air the Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the airship bases at Caraington and overseas should be retained for the timebeing on a minimum of &quot;care and maintenance&quot;basis and not disposed of.-23-
