/ MIFALTYECONOMIES .Difficultiesin the AtlanticFleet.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(31), Con-elusion 5.)1. The First Lord of the Admiralty attended theCabinet and reported as a matter of urgency that the speaker of the House of Commons had allowed theAdjoiirnment to be moved on the question of the recentunrest in the Fleet .   The Speaker would confine thediscussion to the question of unrest and would not allow details of the cuts to be raised.   He himselfproposed to give certain explanations on the cuts,and to add that he had promised an Inquiry and wouldawait the result thereof before taking any decision.After a short discussion the Cabinet  approvedappropriate arrangements for the conduct of the debate on behalf of the Government.
2. The Cabinet discussed further the question of including the London Passenger Transport Bill in theprogramme for the present Session.   They were informedthat opposition to the Bill had increased and that anumber of amendments were down which could not beaccepted.   These included amendments by Colonel Ashley,and the Conservative Members for London were opposing the Bill.    Prom this point of view it was felt to bedifficult to include the Bill in the programme.On the other hand, very strong reasons were urgedfor proceeding with the Bill, in addition to thoseincluded in the Departmental Memorandum by the Ministryof Transport (C.P.-214 (31)).    In particular, the difficult position in which the main-line railways would be placed by a failure to pass the Bill was emphasised.   All development would be stopped, andthere would be no electrification.1 The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinetthat there was a precedent for carrying over a Billby Resolution of the House of Commons to anotherSession of Parliament9 j^oughv..not.to a now Parliament. JThe Cabinet agreed  To leave the question on the agenda paper for the present.
3. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the Secretary of State for India (C.P.-S26 (31)and CP.-232 (31)) on the Indian Financial Position.The Secretary of State informed the Cabinet thatthis question had become one of extreme urgency.The flight from the Rupee appeared to have begun.He gave a number of details indicating the gravity of the issue.In addition to the grave financial situation there was an unbalanced Budget.   The position wascomparable to that which had existed in this country before the National Government took office.    For.months the Government of India had been urged to balance their Budget but so far had failed to do so.As the result of recent telegrams which the Secretaryof State, after consulting the Prime Minister, had sent, the Viceroy had announced on Monday his inten-tion to balance the Budget.    Since then the proposalsof the Finance Member    had been peceived.   Theyonly provided for three crores towards balancing afor the current year ,deficit of twenty crores/   More than   16 croresdeficit during the present year remained.   Theprospect for the following year was somewhat betteron paper, but the Secretary of State&apos;s advisers atthe India Office doubted whether it would balance inpractice.   All expert advice coincided in the viewthat to introduce a Bxidget of this character wouldand,the Treasurybe disastrous.   A Committee at the India Office/had worked out proposals for balancing the Budget, andthese had been examined by the Secretary of State,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Trade.   The Secretary ofState for India was convinced that proposals not
less than those now suggested were essential and mustbe introduced during the present Session of the IndianAssembly (which expired at the end of the following week) if a gigantic financial crash in India was tobe averted.   There were certain questions, however,on which he must consult the Cabinet.   These were:-(i) The, proposed Increased Duty on theimport of cotton piece goods .Nothing short of a 25 per cent, uniform increase inall Import Duties would suffice.   The gainers wouldbe the mill-owners in Bombay, who were financing theCongress Party.   The effect of this would, of course, be disastrous upon Lancashire. The Secretary of state would like to include a corresponding Excise Duty.1 in imposing an excise dutyThe difficulty/was that this would excite the gravestopposition throughout India, which would include theViceroy&apos;s Council and probably the Viceroy himself.The reactions on the Indian Round-Table Conferencealso had to be considered.j(ii) The Protected Services .The proposals of the Finance Member put in the fore-^ the protectedfront a reduction in the salaries of/Civil Servants,etc., whose position was protected by statutoryguarantees.   This would involve legislation in Parlia-ment and would create great difficulties .   There wasnot sufficient time to pass the legislation, and itwas known that there would be strong opposition, andthat Sir John Simon would move a Vote of Censure.The opponents of the measure would ask what was theuse of safeguards at the Round-Table Conferenceif this safeguard of the 2,500 men on whom dependedthe carrying out of all the safeguards in India wasto be torn up.    Consequently the Secretary of state proposed to put these difficulties to.the Viceroy
and to urge him to see the representatives of theServices and try and obtain from them a voluntarycut in view of the national emergency.(iii) Pressure on the Government of India.In view of the failure of the Government of India to balance their Budget and the critical urgency of this being done, the Secretary of State thought it essen-tial to send a telegram of a very strong character,insisting that the Budget must balance and saying hoTit was to be done.   This would be accompanied by a personal explanatory telegram to the Viceroy.On this point the Cabinet were reminded thatthe late Secretary of State had insisted that theGovernment of the United Kingdom could not ignore the Fiscal autonomy convention.The Secretary of State said that he had examined the question carefully, and he was satisfied thatthe powers still existed, but could only be justifiedfor use as an extreme measure in a time of national emergency such as now existed.The Secretary of State circulated a draft of theofficial telegram&quot; which he proposed should be sentto the Government of India, and read to his colleagues the draft of a personal telegram with which he pro-posed to accompany it.some length, but as an even more urgent and criticalquestion relating to the financial position of theUnited Kingdom was still awaiting consideration, itwas found impossible to discuss the various issuesfinally and in detail.    In the circumstances theCabinet agreed   .A copy of this draft telegram is attached to thestandard copy of the Cabinet Minutes.These complicated questions were discussed at
Additional paragraph to^Page 5 of conclusion 5, to &quot;Cabinet &quot;6q(3J). &quot;In the course of the discussion on the Secretaryof State&apos;s proposals it was generally recognised thatit was Justifiable to go to considerable lengths inorder to balance the Indian Budget, but emphasis was laid on-the gravity of sone of the proposals.      It waspointed out that the proposed Excise Duty on cottonwould create tremendous political disturbances inIndia, where it would be s*id that the Duty was imposed in the interests of Lancashire.      It was true, as theCabinet were reminded, that the imposition of theproposed addition to the tariff without an Excise duty would have a disastrous effect on the trade of Lancashire.There was every Justification, however, for the imposition-tion of an Excise Duty in order to raise additional revenue, and on the whole it was felt that theGovernment of India should be pressed to reconsider their objection to this course.      The Cabinet were reminded, however, that there would be a repercussionon the Rounds-Table Conference even though the imposition-tion of an Excise Duty was advantageous to Mr. Gandhi&apos;policy of developing local industries.      The cabinet were also asked to remember that there would be a tremendous outcry in India owing to the exemption ofthe Services, though this would be mitigated to someextent if a voluntary cut were secured.     Stress was laid on the resentment which would be aroused in Indiaif there were any suggestion of dictation of a Budgetfrom London, and this, would react on: the Round-Table 1&quot;      &quot;        &apos;&apos; &apos; . IfConference.     It was felt that the references to theBudget in the telegram to the Viceroy would have tobe most carefully worded.

The Prime Minister communicated certain information that he had received from the Bank ofEngland and said he wished to make a full report ofa meeting he had had with the Deputy Governor ofthe Bank and Mr Peacock the same afternoon.   As thestatement would take some time the Cabinet adjourned until 8-30 p.m. the same evening.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,September 17, 1931.

SgORgJPF. 5952/31 No. of words 151.Copy of Cypher Telegram from Secretary of State toGovernment of India, dated 18th September 1931.Immediate2733.     Finance Department.     Your telegram 9th September2SS0-3 Financial position.H.H,Government have approached a consideration of yourproposal with a deep sense of responsibility.     Not only is itthe case that a restoration of the Budget position is anessential preliminary to a restoration of confidence in the stability of the currency but we are also in virtue of thePrime minister&apos;s declaration under an obligation to do our utmost to balance the Budget.Your estimates indicate on existing basis deficits thisyear of Rs.l9-g- crores and next year at least Rs .20 crores.Towards meeting these deficits your proposals , if I havecorrectly understood them, aim at providing Rs.3.8 crores thisyear (assuming that possible savings in expenditure areapproximately offset by special items named in your paragraph1), and rather more than Rs.20 crores next year, (apart fromdoubtful prospects of customs and possibility of Retrenchment0ommitteer3 estimates not being fully realised).     This would lead to a final revenue deficit this year of Rs.l5f- crores, andan apparently balanced Budget next year.     Above figures assumeraid on sinking fund provision in 1932-3 and, if as a matter ofcaution, railways are reckoned as failing to earn even interestin both years, thus entailing raids on depreciation fund ofRs.160 lakhs each year, real deficits to be anticipated wouldt be Rs.l7  crores and crores in 1931-2 and 1932-3respectively.2.     The situation imperatively demands -swift action whichwill both improve the revenue position at once and affordclear evidence of your determination to rectify the whole situation/
situation, even at the cost of measures which may be of sodrastic, unpopular, or inconvenient a character as to be outof the question except in the gravest emergency.     Anemergency Budget which does not fulfil these requirements would do nothing towards restoring credit of India.     On the contraryit would suggest to the world that we are playing our last cardand that it is a weak one.     I deeply regret that from this, theessential standpoint, it must be admitted that your proposalsarc wholly inadequate.      They provide only a relatively meagrereinforcement to our resources during tho critical few monthsremaining of this financial year, and in face of our mostprecarious Ways and Means position they would add, this year andnext, over Rs.20 crores to our accumulated deficit.     a comparison would inevitably be drawn between such a programme and the action taken by His Majesty1s Government, who incomparable circumstances have not hesitated to act swiftly andto demand heavy sacrifices from the public in order that in thisyear and the next the budgets may be genuinely balanced.3.     These circumstances make it imperative that anemergency Bill should be introduced in the present session.Some of the objections to this course stated in your telegramof 26th August have fortunately disappeared, and the othersmust be faced.     This course seems essential in order to give more convincing evidence of our determination than would be afforded by a mere announcement to be followed not till nearly two months later by definite measures.4.     I fully recognise that it is too late to hope to achieve anything approaching balance between revenue andexpenditure this year.     We must do everything possible todeduce the yea,r&apos;s deficit, but my consideredvieii?/
view is that in present circumstances 1931-2 and 1932-3 shouldbe viewed as a single whole,   and the maximum effort he made to balance the twe years taken together,   i.e. to produce in thelatter year a surplus sufficient to wipe out deficit of theformer.    Amount to he aimed at,  in the two years,   additional to your proposal, would seem to he about Rs. 21 or 22 crores.5.    As regards Amy retrenchments,  I note that military authorities now agree in hoping to effect ultimaterecurring savings of Rs. 275 lakhs on two general conditions,I have telegraphed separately approving application of MayReport economies to Indian Establishment which will meet firstconditiont; .    As regards second,  I am willing in thecircumstances    to give Government of India discretionary powersto sanction reductions in staffs and departments other thanfighting services,  and generally to effect economies as proposedin last part of your telegram No. 2308 S.    As regards Rs. 175lakhs capital expenditure,  it would not be justifiable that thisshould be financed from loan funds,  a procedure which would afford no real relief to Budget.    I therefore accept Commander-in-Chiefs suggestion that these charges should be deferred forone year.6.    I deal separately with the cotton duties.   Leavingthem aside I agree that a percentage surcharge on all customsincluding,  I presume,  Central excises,  but excepting exportduties,   and on salt revenue cannot be avoided in this emergency.10 per cent, is inadequate for the purpose and   I would pressupon you the urgent necessity of raising this to 25 per cent.Tbe only alternative to this would be to double the salt duty.I agree with your implied argument that a percentage increase on salt vjaay evoke less hostility if it forms part of a generalproportionate increase. It should not however be necessary to forgo the proposed particular increase in duty on artificial silk,  etc. which I sanction. As regards the two articles nowfree
free, viz. raw oottoa and machinery, I agree that a dutyshould be imposed, and suggest that the rate might be increased in proportion to the rise from 10 to 25 per cent, in customssurcharge. Additional duties on these uwo items might produce,say, Rs.2 crores over 18 months.    Ia leaving cotton dutiesfor separate consideration I did not contemplate thepossibility of excluding cotton imports from the general25% surcharge. But it would appear unjustifiable to increaseso seriously the burden on consumers without calling fora greater sacrifice from those who will directly benefit than would be involved in a duty on raw cotton. If it were at allpossible I&quot;would not hesitate to suggest a temporary exciseon all Indian manufacturers cotton or otherwise   that might beadvantaged by increased duties but for administrative reasonsa general levy ox this kind is impracticable. In the casehowe^fer of the Indian Cotton Mills which will now enjoy agreater advantage than is warranted by the merits of the caseno administrative difficulty stands in the way. A9art altogether from the dominant consideration that the increased revenue(which I roughly calculate at 2-g- crores per annum) will be a useful reinforcement of the revenue position, there is, on merits, ample justification for the levy of an excise onlocally manufactured goods equivalent to the extra duty now tobe Imposed on imported goods.I an not unmindful of the political difficulties. I know that the very name of cotton excise arouses acute political controversy in India and that serious reactions may follow the introduction of any proposal to re-impose this tax* ButH.M.G. with a full sense of all that is involved, would beprepared to face these difficulties as they are convincedthat the re-imposition of an excise is fully justified, notonly by financial exigencies, but also by the substantial increase now to be imposed on imported goods. They would therefore most earnestly press you to consider the inclusionof such an excise in your emergency Bill.7. A surcharge so heavy as 25 per cent will undoubtedlytend toreduce
reduce volume of imports^ and perhaps to some extentconsumption of salt and excisable oils, hut even so thereshould he substantial increase of revenue.     On yourcalculation that a surcharge of 10 per cent, would yieldRs. 406 lakhs in a full year?  a surcharge of 25 per cent,might, allowing for reduced consumption, yield approximatelydouble this amount, or,  say Rs. 12 crores in the eighteen months period.     So far as imports are diminished, this would improve the balance of trade and so react favourably on theexchange, and. currency position.8.1 cannot but feel that in these circumstances theImergency Bill should also provide for increase in letter andpostcard rates as part of present comprehensive plan, estimatedyield being, I understand, Rs. 78 lakhs ira a year (see yourtelegram 9th August,  1989-S paragraph 2), or Rs. 117 lakhsover 18 months.     I am not clear to what extent measures referred to in paragraph 2 of your telegram of the 9th august and paragraph 3 of my predecessors telegram of 20th August(namely, increased registration fees and telegraph rates andeconomies suggested by departmental officers) have been takeninto account in your estimates, but I agree that the utmost possible should be done along these lines.9.    Towards filling the remaining gap, it seems certainthat income-tax must inevitably be called on for a heavierand earlier contribution than you propose.    I feel strongly that a flat surcharge of 20 per cent, or a graduated scale of increases estimated to produce same yield should be imposed by Finance Bill this session.    Additional revenue totalling about Rs. 2f crores a year should be obtainable, that isRs. 5-g- crores altogether if the full increase is applied in respect of 1931-32. You have precedent of action now beingtaken in United Kingdom for enhancing taxes on income halfway
through year with effect for full year, and similar action was also taken here in 1915.

10. I now summarise the position that should result from the application of the above measures. Taking the deficit over the two year period after application of your proposals, as Rs. 22 crores, we should have as additional fortification of revenue from Postal changes Rs. 117 lakhs from additional duty on raw cotton and machinery Rs.200 lakhs, from enhancement of customs etc. surcharged, Rs.600 lakhs,  from enhancement of income tax Rs.420 lakhs, total Rs 1337 lakhs. This leaves a gap of approximately Rs.8\\1//2 crores unbridged.

11. In these circumstances I recognise that in addition to measures already discussed a general reduction in salaries is from a financial point of view very desirable. Heavy increase of income-tax now proposed which in itself coupled with recent enhancements involves substantial sacrifices by officials would in itself I consider justify cutting all salaries of Rs.50 per mensem and over not liable to it. As regards higher civil salaries I have again on receipt of your telegram dated 13th September given most anxious consideration to your representations and fully realise difficulties which you apprehend in bringing forward drastic proposals which do not include specific salary cuts for protected officers. But I have already informed you of the position of H.M.G. as regards legislation. If therefore you still feel that increase of income-tax is not in itself sufficient to justify cut in lower salaries/
salaries, your difficulty might perhaps he met by thefollowing plan which would be in addition to, but not in substitution for, revision of income-tax and super-taxscales.     This, failing an agreement on the part of theServices that their salaries should be cut, seems the&apos; only practicable alternative.      On introduction of supplementaryBudget it might be announced that ^eads of Central and provincial Governments and Members of Executive Councils hadvoluntarily agreed to a reduction of their salaries, andthat you were proposing to issue an immediate generalinvitation to Services to agree voluntarily to cuts in payon some definite scale after consultation with ServiceAssociations on principle of voluntary cut and possibly ondetails.   This will talee, time and as failure to obtain thenecessary amount of support might have unfortunate resultsdoubtless great care will be taken in framing theannouncement to the legislature, so as not to embarrass Local Governments or to commit other membersof the services than those who have at the time of theannouncement accepted a voluntary cut.   A.voluntary cutthroughout all grades of the services down to the lowest minimum considered practicable would probably have a greater political effect than any other procedure.Of course I do not suggest that the Budget should beheld up on this account.On view stated in your telegram N0.23O8-S of14th September Army officers would as regards pay in Indiabe treated on parity with civil officers, but there maybe difficulty arising in particular from fact thatBritish service officers are obviously not in same position as regular Indian services. .
12.   Prom point of view of Central revenues financialbenefit from voluntary cuts is likely to be of no real significance and in any case it cannot beassumed for purposes of Budget.   Estimates, moreover,are based, I understand, on assumption that full programme of economies accepted in principle by youwill be achieved.    Further douMful factor relates torealisation in two years of currency profits frominterest on Sola Standard Reserve investments whichhas already dwindled materially and may sink virtuallyto vanishing point.Having regard to the precarious exchange position and to the load, of floating debt the realisation of a true balance over 2 years is urgentlyto be desired.    You will I have no doubt, explore all further possibilities of retrenchment and reinforcementgenerally, including railway passenger fares.    in presenting new Budget I suggest that best line to takewould be that, taking the 18 months period from October1931 to March 1933, measures provide for surplus ofrevenue over expenditure.    In exhibiting figiires from thisangle I reckon half deficit on existing basis as properto second half of year.   It is of urgent importance thatno time should be lost in presenting revised Finance Billembodying the new programme and H.M.G. has approved this telegram and is confident that you will take immediate steps to give effect to these proposals.
