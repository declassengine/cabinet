ECONOMY.The Round table conference.Letter fromthe Secretaryto the IndianPrinces .(previous reference:Cabinet 54(31), Oon-clusion 10.)1. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet thefollowing letter which he had received from tfe-ejtoaagotary to tho Indium--Iranoea-, offering to foregothe contribution which His Majesty&apos;s Government was making towards the expenses of the visit of the Indian&apos;States Delegation to London:-5, Lygon Place,Grosvenor Gardens,  S.W.1.15th September, 1931.&quot;My dear Prime Minister,We in India have watched with intenseinterest the widespread response of theBritish people to their Countryrs need,occasioned by the acute financial situation, and their regard and readiness to make sacrifices for the common wealhave evoked the warmest appreciation ofthe Princes .   Thejr have followed withdeep sympathy the efforts of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to meet the situation and havebeen much impressed by the proposals for economy which have been so carefully worked out and boldly put forward.In the belief that at the present momentany saving would perhaps be helpful, allthe members of the Indian States Delegation- now in England - have authorised me to convey to you that they wish to foregothe contribution which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was making towards the expensesof the visit of the States Delegation toLondon.   They are almost certain that theremaining members of the Delegation, whohave yet to arrive, would also like to associate themselves with this decision.But I shall let you know of their decision as soon as I am in a position to do so.We realise that the amount that would thus be saved will only be a drop in theocean, but you know that it is being offeredas a token of the feeling of friendshipwhich the Princes of India and theirsubjects have always entertained for thepeople of Great Britain.Yours sincerely,(Signed) HAMTDULLAH.&quot;The Cabinet expressed deep appreciation of theaction of the Indian Princes.
ECONOMY. 2. The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thatOffer from the the Duke of Abercorn had asked that a reduction mightGovernor ofNorthern be made in his salary as Governor of Northern Ireland,Ireland.
ADMIRALTY 3. ^he First Lord of the Admiralty raised, as aEconomies .__ matter of the greatest urgency, the difficultiesDiff icultiesin the Atlantic which had arisen in the Atlantic Fleet in CromartyFleet.Firth in consequence of the reductions in pay.    He^Reference: read to the Cabinet a series of telegrams dated^it^Con-        September 14th and 15th describing the developmentelusion 2.)fx.of the disturbances.    Later in the Meeting admiral sir Frederick Field, First Sea Lord of the admiralty and Chief of the Naval Staff, and Rear-Admiral R.M.Colvin, Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief ofthe Atlantic Fleet, were introduced and gave in fullerdetail particulars of the disturbances that had arisenIt appeared that the disturbances had been con-fined in the main to the crews of certain ships whichhad given leave on Monday September 14th.    The libertymen, while on shore at Invergordon (where there are few facilities for recreation beyond the Naval canteenand the football grounds) had attended a meeting inthe canteen at which some of the men had addressedtheir comrades on the question of the cuts in pay.They had afterwards returned on board ship.    On thefollowing day, when the ships were due to put to sea,large numbers of men from the crews of certain ships had crowded the forecastles in such a way as to render it impossible (without the use of force) to raise theanchor and. put to sea.   The attitude of the men ofthe ships affected towards their Officers had been inevery way respectful.   The Petty Officers and LeadingSeamen had remained in all respects loyal.   Some ofthe ships whose crews had not been at the canteen meefe-mg on the previous/ day put to sea, but the Commander-in-Chief, in viewof the difficulties in     other        ships, orderedtheir return to harbour, and the exercises were
cancelled.The Chief of the Staff of the Atlantic Fleet,while not excluding the possibility of a certainamount of propaganda by outside influences, was ofopinion that the difficulties were based on a genuine -sense of grievance on the part of the men.   He reportedActingthat in the opinion of the/Commander-in-Chief theFleet would not move until some concession was made.(In this connection, towards the end of the Meetingthe First Lord of the Admiralty read a telegram justActingreceived from the/Commander-in-Chief which indicated that if no action were taken the situation threatened to get out of hand.)    Preliminary investigations hadbeen made and were reported to the Admiralty in the telegrams referred to above.    In addition, the Chiefof the Staff had been sent to report the situation tothe Admiralty.From the preliminary investigations it hadtranspired that the men who were most dissatisfiedwere        married men     whohad married before completing the term of servicewhen they were entitled to a marriage allowance.These men had married in the confident belief, basedon pronouncements by previous Governments, that their pay would not be reduced.   Many of them had rentedhouses, bought furniture on the hire-purchase system,entered into insurances,  and so forth.    Owing to the cuts in their pay they foresaw an impossibility of meeting the financial engagements that they hadincurred on behalf of their wives and families.   Thedifficulty was much accentuated by the early date atwhich, the cuts were to take effect (October 1st), which did not give them time to make the necessary disposi-tions .   The Board of Admiralty, who had given prelim-inary consideration to the question in the light of
the report by the Chief of Staff of the AtlanticFleet, inclined to the view that these men had a realgrievance and had suggested that the date at whichthe cuts came into operation should be deferred for amonth in order to give time for a re-examination ofthe question and to enable any classes of specialhardship to be re-considered, and that, in order toprovide an opportunity for such re-examination, theships should be ordered to return to their home ports.The Cabinet, while not disregarding the fact thatgrievances of a specially onerous kind might exist in the Fleet, were deeply concerned with the effect which any concession would have not only in the SisterServices but also on the whole scheme of Governmenteconomies.   To announce a concession in one case(more particularly one which could be represented asa surrender to force) would have incalculable conse-quences.   The suggested postponement was thereforeunacceptable.Doubts were felt as to whether it was expedient,in the circumstances, to withdraw the ships to thehome ports, as desired by the Sea lords, in order to expedite investigation and to enable the men to get in touch with their homes, but this was eventuallyagreed to on the understanding that it was made clearthat this was done in obedience to an order from theAdmiralty.    Stress was also laid on the importance ofdealing only with classes, of cases and not with individual cases .After considerable discussion the First Lordwithdrew, with the First Sea Lord and the Chief ofStaff of the Atlantic Fleet, and drafted a statement which he later read to the Cabinet, and which, subjectto certain amendments, was approved.
not he policy approved by the Cabinet was as follows(a) That the Prime Minister should make inParliament the same afternoon a statementof a general character as to the attitude to be adopted by the Government towardscases in which particular classes ofpersons affected by the proposed cutshave been represented to be unfairlyaffected.    It was arranged that thisshould be accomplished by the following question and Answer:-BY PRIVATE NOTICE.Capt. Sir Ernest Bennett:    To ask thePrime Minister whether his attention has been called to classes of personsinvolved by various economies whosecases are of peculiarly great hardshipfor special reasons, and whether theGovernment can see its way to consider them.(Answered by the Prime Minister)Yes Sir.   Various cases have beenbrought to the attention of theGovernment in which particular classesof persons affected by the proposedcuts have been represented to beunfairly affected.These difficulties have been the; subject of consideration by theGovernment which believes that theycan generally be adjusted withouti materially affecting the BudgetI Estimates ,- (\(NOTE: After the Meeting of the Cabinetthe Prime Minister decided to omit the following words whichhad been contained in the draftAnswer read to the Gabinet:-&quot;Further statements will accordingly be made as occasion arises&quot;.)(b) That shortly&apos; after the Prime minister had given the above Answer, the FirstLord of the Admiralty should make thefollowing statement in reply to private notice Questions:-&quot;The Board of Admiralty have had under their earnest consideration the repre-sentations received from the OfficerCommanding the Atlantic Fleet as tothe hardships involved in certainclasses by the reductions ordered by His MajestyTs Government in Navalrates of pay .
1 r&apos;Hi i their Lordships have directedthe ships of the Atlantic fleet to proceed to their Home Portsforthwith.Personal investigation will then be made by the Commanders-in-Chief and representatives ofthe Admiralty into those classesof cases in which it is alleged that the reductions press except-ionally on those concerned.His Majesty&apos;s Government have authorised the Board of admiralty to make proposals for alleviatingthe hardship in these classes assoon as the facts have been ascertained by the contemplatedinvestigation&quot;.(c) That the Admiralty should issue an orderto the Fleet in accordance with the state-ment by the First Lord of the Admiraltygiven above:(d) That the First Lord of the admiralty should consider whether it was possible,pending the investigation referred toin (b) above, to provide by administrative action for the case of seamen who, inmaking allotments to their wives, areembarrassed by the early date at wlrichthe cuts will apply.
EDUCATIONECONOMIES .(previous reference:Cabinet 55(31), Con-clusion 21)4.    In the course of the discussion referred toin the preceding Minute, the attention of the cabinet was called to the following Question to be addressedto the President of the Board of Education onThurs day,September 17th:-&quot;Lieutenant-Colonel Gault, - To ask thePresident of the Board of Education,whether the 15 per cent, reduction inteachers&apos; salaries is proposed by theGovernment as an emergency cut only andwithout prejudice to the rates of pension to which they are entitled under existingsalaries;    and if it is intended toreinstate them in their remunerationwhen the financial conditions of theCountry justify a return to the presentstandards of pay.&quot;The Cabinet agreed  That the reply should be as follows:-&quot;The reduction in teachers&apos;  salariesis occasioned by the national emergency and is not to be regarded as the viewof the Government of what should be proper rates of remuneration of teachers under less abnormal condi-tions .   The position shotild be reviewed on its merits when thefinancial position of the Countryallows&quot; .
