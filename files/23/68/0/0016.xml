TEE INDIANFINANCIALSFUATIZN.?Jie Rupee and sterling.[previous reference:Cabinet 62(31), Con-elusion 8.)fxThe Cabinet &apos;r-et to consider further telegramsinterchanged between the Secretary of State forIndia and the Government of India on the Indianfinancial situation, and more particularly the relation between the rupee and sterling.   these telegrams had been circulated before the Meeting,and a copy is attached to the standard file ofCabinet Minutes.The Cabinet adhered to their previous decision in favour of keeping the rupee linked to sterling,and authorised the Secretary of State for India tosend to the Government of India a very full explana-tory telegram on the lines of a draft which he read to the Cabinet,  and subject to certain amendmends and additions.    (A copy of this telegram is attachedto the standard file of Cabinet Minutes.)    The cabinet also approved a suggestion by the Secretary of Statefor India that the Prime Minister and the lord president of the Council should be invited to supple-,ment the above with a Personal telegram sent to theViceroy on behalf of the Cabinet.(NOTE:    A telegram was received by theSecretary of St?.te for India-early on September 24th informing him that a statement was being madein the Assembly the s?me afternoonon the lines of the Cabinet?s policy.)2i Whitehall Gardens, S.-.1,September 24, 1951too
SECRET.The following private telegram sent by theViceroy after receipt of the instructions approvedby the Cabinet yesterday evening is circulated forthe information of his colleagues by the Secretaryof State for India.24th September,  1931.Telegram from Viceroy dated 24th September,  1931.Most Immediate.Private and Personal.    Statement, is beingmade in Assembly this afternoon on lines of your policy.Pull text will be telegraphed to you as soon as possible.
2803. Most Immediate.Finance Department.      Your telegram 23rdSeptember 2375-S.    Exchange.Whole question has been againexhaustively considered by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwhose conclusions on different points raised inyour telegram are as stated below:I.        Your policy as we understand it isto discontinue for the time being any attempt tosupport the rupee your intervention in theexchange market being entirely suspended.    Rupee is tbe allowed to find a new level and you would retainan open mind as to whether and when and on whatscale you would again intervene in order to give itsome stable exchange value.        The consequences of this policy are;(a) that in the flight from the rupee theexchange value of the currency would be drivenheadlong and there is no reason for thinking thatthe fall could be arrested until the rupee exchangewas represented by the bullion value of the rupee;this would entail the ruin of holders of Indianinternal debt and of savings in rupees.(b) In these circumstancesF. 6287.Cypher telegram from Secretary ofState to Government of India, dated23rd September, 1931.    711 words.
there would he a steep rise of prices andhoarding of all commodities,  including gold and silver, would be inevitable as experience on theContinent of Europe has plainly shown;(c) Very dangerous social andeconomic conditions would then be createdwhich would inevitably threaten the peace of the country.(d) Your budget would be hopelesslyunbalanced and difficulties would be aggravated by inability to renew maturing-Treasury Bills, holders of which would seek to convert the proceeds thereof intocommodities.        Discharge of Treasury bills would entail wholesale printing of notes,causing uncontrolled inflation.(e) Your Reserves,  so far from beingconserved, would soon be dissipated and itwould be necessary to export gold in order tomeet your London obligations;(f) India would thus be left on a silverbasis with a disorganised Budget and would inevitably default.Such a policy would be disastrous to theinterests of India and cannot be entertained byH.M. G.You seem to be under the impression that thereis a parallel between Great Britain&apos;s position with her currency adrift and that of India.     you should remember in this connection that Great
Britain is still a creditor on an enormousscale, the value of its foreign investmentsrunning into thousands of millions of pounds, withrelatively no comparable foreign public debt.Further, recent action by H.M.G. has assured a balanced Budget for this and next year so that thedanger of monetary inflation has been removed.Contrast the case of India.        India has no substantial foreign assets and is a debtor country with large obligations in sterling, governmentaland private.       As you know large sterling-obligations mature in the next few months.    Ifthe rupee is held at l/6d the plan on which wehave agreed affords a prospect of balancing theBudget over this and next year combined, but witha demoralised exchange an unbalanced Budget is inevitable and it is difficult to see how thesituation could be redressed within ameasurable period.       Our efforts to balance theBudget would be rendered futile, recourse to the printing press would be necessary leading tofurther inflation.2.       There appears to be an impression in india that the policy on which H.M.G. have decided is designed to capture India&apos;s gold for GreatBritain.      I have already explained that a free market for gold is to be maintained in London and that if any
part of India&apos;s gold is sold she will obtain full premiumin sterling but you will understand that in existingexchange conditions India&apos;s gold cannot be acquired by theBank of England and is,  in the circumstances, bound to be exported from England to one or other of the few remaininggold standard countries.3.       You postulate that Prime Minister&apos;s declarationof support would still hold good even if the rupee were abandoned. If policy of maintaining rupee at l/6d isabandoned His Majesty&apos;s Government will regard themselves as free to refuse to help and will not renew their promise,Reason for this is obvious as the burden on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be immeasurably increased owing to thevarious reactions of an inflationary regime.4.        His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore must request that your Government should give effect to the policy laiddown in my telegram of 22nd September No. 2787.      You mustnot for a moment suppose that the fact that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were and are not prepared to give an immediatecredit in response to your suggestion means that in eventof need arising to assist the Government of India to fulfil their sterling obligations there would be any danger of His Majesty&apos;s Government being then unable togive such assistance as may be decided to be desirable.You should therefore have no misgivings in making useof the formula in my telegram of yesterday.
In asking you to collaborate in carrying through a policy which I know is unwelcome to you, H.M.G.realise that they are imposing on you and yourFinance Member a difficult duty.      But they doemphatically regard it as a duty at this period of grave emergency, being convinced that the policy they have laid down is in the highest interests ofIndia.
SECRET.The annexed telegrams exchanged with theGovernment of India are circulated by the Secretaryof State for India in connection with the meetingof the Cabinet, this evening at. 6 p.m.23rd September,  1931.
Telegram from Viceroy, dated 25rd September,  1951.794-S.        Private and personal.      Following a summary offuller official telegram which follows.     We cannot acceptyour plan.      General assurance which you offer will not hold the position.      We shall lose the reserve and HisMajesty&apos;s Government will still be in the position of inability to help.      In Indian interests only course we can support is -(l) Continuing the temporary suspension of currencyobligations;(2) Declaring intention to stabilise again afterthe sit\iation adjusted; we should add, thirdly,statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government willimplement the Prime Minister&apos;s promise byhelping us to stabilise when the time comes,which appears best way to get out of this difficult aspect of the position.We are anxious to do utmost to help His Majesty&apos;sGovernment subject to our paramount obligation to considerIndian interests first but we believe it will help them tobe free from their immediate obligations and let us meet our own troubles.      We are all united in this, and unlessyou can meet us it will be impossible for us to carry on as a Government,      This aspect is further explained in following telegram.      As the only possible immediate course,so as to give you more time, we might consider following;reopen our currency obligations subject to controllingOrdinance and see what happens for the first two days; then,if we lose large amount of sterling, revert to our course and His Majestyls Government to restore to us in the formof credit what we have lost.We infinitely prefer straight decision without this intermediate experiment.     We must make statement to-morrow and must have your immediate reply.
6241/31. (598 groups)Copy Cypher telegram from Secretary of State to Governmentof India,  dated 22nd September,  1931.SECRET.2787.    MOST IMMEDIATE.Finance Department.    Your telegram 22ndSep t embe r.Question has been most carefully consideredagain by His Majesty&apos;s Government who havereconfirmed policy set out in my telegram of21st September 2756.  and. embodied in my speech at Round Table Conference yesterday.    A policy of abandoning ratio and leaving rupee to driftpositively invites flight from rupee spellschaos for India and cannot be entertained.    abandonment of l/6d. would,   as explained in my telegram No.2756 involve the withdrawal by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of their undertaking and we should be faced with grave risk of default on our externalobligations.    It is quite impossible for HisMajesty&apos;s Government in present circumstances to place an immediate credit of  50 millions orany such figure at disposal of Government ofIndia but in order to help you in re-establishingconfidence in India you/
are authorised to state, in putting situation beforepublic, that the suspension of the gold standard inthe United Kingdom does not affect the undertaking given by His Majesty&apos;s Government in June last andreaffirmed by Prime Minister last week and so longas we adhere to the established policy of maintaining the rupee at l/6d we are assured of the support of his majesty&apos;s Government should need arise.The decision of H.M.G.  requires that the ordinanceissued yesterday should be at once withdrawn.    I agreehowever with your view that some machinery of exchange control will be needed, and ordinance should thereforebe replaced by another Ordinance taking power    tomake regulations and vary them from time to time.But it is essential that the cancellation of thefirst Ordinance and its replacement by anothershould be simultaneous.      Substance of new Ordinanceshould I suggest be to following effect.      that notwithstanding anything contained in section 5of the Currency Act, 1927 Governor General inCouncil may from time to time make regulationsdefining or limiting the persons to whom sales ofgold or sterling shall be made at the rate prescribedunder section 5(1) of the Act; and the purposes for which such sales may be made,  and generallymay from time to time take or authorise the taking of such measures in relation to the/
the exchanges and otherwise as the Governor General inCouncil may consider expedient   for the purpose of maintaining the statutory ratio.In drafting care should he taken to make it clear that powers assumed would not cover an alteration of the ratio.I suggest, for your consideration that,  in explainingsituation you should lay stress on fact that issue of firstOrdinance was a purely provisional measure to give time forconsideration and that interval has enabled you to setbefore the country a fully considered policy designed toprotect its interests in the present emergency.    Thedeclaration of three days&apos; public holiday will enable public to settle down and can presumably be extended for anotherday or two if necessary as it is essential that regulations should be published before Banks re-open.For your information I would state that we are assured of the help of the Treasury in liquefying sterlinginvestments so far as this may be needed to finance our immediate commitments while they would also be readyto arrange.for advances against gold in process ofshipment.    A free gold market will be maintained here and wha+ever way we dispose of gold we may be sure ofobtaining full premium in sterling.I    am    sending   you    in   a    separate/
telegram some suggestions regarding exchange control andi am ready if at any time you think it expedient-to confer with Exchange Banks in London.    In view of change insituation since your telegram of 19th September,  2350-Swas despatched. I think it would be better not to ape-roachBanks until we are in a position to invite their co-operation on specific plan.I attach greatest, importance to suggestions at end ofparagraph 7 of my telegram of 20th September.  2756, regardingmobilising of publicity by whatever means you consideradvantageous.    In this connection you will no doubt, makecapital of fact that internal budgetary position is tobe restored and of our new plan which is designed tosecure a balance of revenue over expenditure for this yearand next combined.    With internal budgetary positionrectified and the assurance of H.M.G&apos;s help on theconditions indicated above I hope that we shall be able tocarry policy on which H.M.G. have decided to a succesful issue.    Please convey to Imperial Bank message of appreciation from H.M.G.  and myself of their co-operation at this crisis.Please telegraph text of new Ordinance and regulations.
1,10 SJ 1MMEDI AT 3.2364.S. Finance Department.Your telegram of the 21st instant, 2756.We received news about sterling through press telegrams at 8.30this morning, and nothing from you until the first part of your2756, which was decyphered by 10.0 a.m.On press messages we considered the situation as fully as time permitted,  and came to the (? definite)  conclusion:;thatthere was serious danger of panic, especially in Bombay.    Itwas too late to stop business by ordering holiday, and promp action was essential.      The Ordinance, of which you have beeninformed,  suspending Currency Act obligations was issued, and instructions were sent to Bombay and Calcutta not to  sellsterling.      We have since ordered Local Governments to declare-Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday public holidays.2.      Our action was deferred to last possible momentbut had to be taken before your telegram had come through andwe have no doubt that it was right action to take in thecircumstances.      We have just heard that in first few minutesin Bombay, before our orders were known to market, demands from banks, etc., for  435,000 were received.     This!iJC/ETP/FHB/MI/I.

Second    of    three    parts.3.   We have now received news of your announce-ment at the Round Table Conference and instructions aboutOrdinance.    We fear that you have not appreciated whatthe consequences will be, as to which our apprehensions are confirmed by what happened today in Bombay.4.    The position recently has been one of complete lack of confidence, both in India and in London,in our ability to maintain- the exchange at Is. 6d.      Wehave been selling large and growing quantities of sterling,foreign money was being withdrawn from India as rapidly aspossible, capital was being exported in large amounts andin Bombay there have been heavy speculative purchases ofgold.    At the beginning of last week it looked as if a crisis was approaching, and, but for the restriction of credit by the Imperial Bank, strong announcements in Indiaand Prime Minister&apos;s statement in Parliament, the crisiswould probably have materialised.      This was the situationbefore the Bank of England was relieved of gold obligations.
After this, no verbal assurances will be believed,(corrupt group) previous doubts as to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s ability to assist us owing to their need of all their resources for their own purposes will be converted into practical certainty.     You say that.HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s undertaking stands if we make every effort to maintain 3s. 6d, but you forbid us to declare this publicly.    In these circumstances, if wecancel the Ordinance we shall, when we re-open for business, be overwhelmed with demands for sterling which no mere bluff credit could stop, in view of the heavyTreasury Bill maturities in the next few weeks.
phb/etp/aw.(237 groups)5336.DECYPHER    OF    TELEGRAM.from government of India, finance department, to Secretary ofState for India.(COPIESCIRCULATED)Dated   Simla, 22nd September, 1931.Received   22nd September, 1931, 1.20 a.m.MOST IMMEDIATE.2364-S.Third and last part.5.For these reasons vie are convinced thatcancellation of Ordinance and, at your discretion, alternative(2) of your telegram, can only avoid disaster on condition that His Majesty1s Government does something to createassurance that they will back us.     A contingent promise, for reasons stated above, will be useless.    We are deeply concernednot to increase difficulties of His Majesty&apos;s Government, butwe must put Indian interests first, and we cannot justifiablyenter on course which will dissipate reserves with no hope ofmaintaining position.    This is decision which you have taken inyour own case, and India will ask why we have chosendifferently.      The only justification could be effectiveassistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government.    After very carefulconsideration in Council we must ask you, if we are to followthis course, to give us immediately a credit of at leastfifty million pounds and to allow us forthwith and before wedraw further on our own reserves, to draw on this credit to(? meet) the demands which may be made upon us to sell sterling,and to announce that this (7 credit) has been given on these terms.6.We think that in addition to this credit, it
will be necessary to introduce some machinery of control onthe lines suggested by you, for such machinery, thoughineffective by itself, may be valuable in combination with credit.    We should welcome suggestions from you aboutOrdinance.7.    What we therefore require is assurance of credit and two days to work out Control Ordinance.    without these conditions it is unanimous view of Council that we oughtto maintain Ordinance and preserve our reserves intact tomeet sterling obligations and until occasion is ripe to stabilise at new level.    We trust that you will appreciate that we are acting with deep sense of our own responsibility and that you will do your best to help us.
HOST IMMEDIATE.2756.    Finance Department.    Efforts to maintainsterling having proved ineffective, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided to relieve Bank of England ofits obligation to sell gold.    Announcement to this effect will appear in Monday&apos;s papers.  (See separatetelegram).    I am giving you first possible intimationso that we may shape our policy to meet difficultiesof extraordinary situation.2.    Choice lies between(1)    suspension of exchange obligation in to to atonce;(2)    working on l/6d.  sterling as our basic rate,viz. maintenance of unlimited offer tosell reverses at l/5^d.(3)    rate as in (2) but with limitation of amountor according to purpose of remittance;(4)    adoption of some new rate, e.g. l/4d. gold orsterling as basis of operations under conditions of either (2) or (3) above.3.    I rule out (4) at once as it is unthinkablethat we should change ratio in present crisis.4.    As regards (1) , this would precipitate acrash and cannot be contemplated so long as there is any hope of maintaining present parity with sterling and tiding over initial period of anxiety.   Moreoverp 6195/31. (669 words).Cypher telegram from Secretary of State toGovernment of India dated 20th September 1931.
if we were to abandon l/6d. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould consider themselves absolved from undertaking to come to our assistance in event of need.     Onthis point I may state., for your confidential information, that the suspension of the gold standardhere will not affect the contingent undertaking givenby His Majesty&apos;s Government that they will be preparedshould the need arise to  request Parliament to assistIndia in fulfilling her obligations provided that every effort is made to maintain the rupee at l/6d.sterling.    Above understanding should in no circumstances be disclosed.5.    Coming to  (2) and (3), an offer limited in quantity would clearly not suffice to maintain exchangand would undoubtedly induce a scramble forremittance with disastrous consequences.      Thoughfully impressed with the difficulties of a decision and the uncertainty of the results I have decided,after prolonged consideration and in consultation with treasury, that the best chance of avoiding collapseand of steadying opinion lies in  (2)  coupled with most stringent application of measures by imperial and other Banks to restrict advances to genuinecommercial transactions on lines referred to in yourtelegram of 19th September 2350-S.     I am addressingRound Table Conference on subject tomorrow and amannouncing decision to adhere to l/6d. sterling.Text of my remarks will be telegraphed separately.6.    Section 5 of the Currency Act 1927 placeson Governor General in Council obligation either tosell gold on l/6d. basis for delivery at Bombay or
at his option sterling at equivalent rate.      definition of equivalent rate in sub-section (2)  of section 5relates this to the Bank of England&apos;s statutory buyingprice for gold, viz.  3.17.9d.     No change being madein this obligation under arrangements for suspension of gold payments, the option under section 5remains,  and can continue to be operated as is expressed in your Notification of 1st April 1927, viz.to sell sterling at l/5^d.      As therefore I havedecided that we should adhere to existing statutory basis, no modification of law or Notification isrequired so far as rate is concerned.    I recognisehowever that events may prove too strong for us tomaintain offer to sell unlimited exchange to allcomers.        I think therefore you should consider andat once prepare a scheme for imposing a stringentexchange control which would have for its object onthe one hand the limitation of sales to financinggenuine trade purposes ana on the other the compulsory acquisition of foreign exchange realised from exportof goods and securities.        I think you ought to havean Ordinance drafted on these lines ready for immediateissue should circumstances demand it.        If there istime I should be glad if you would communicate the text of the draft to me but if you consider immediateissue imperative you are authorised to bring it into operation without reference to me.    I suggestthat Ordinance itself should be drawn on broad linesauthorising Governor General in Council to makewhatever regulations may appear expedient from timeto time.      I suggest that you and Finance Member
should at once take whatever means of publicityyou consider most impressive to explain to Indianpublic the abnormal circumstances of the crisis, theimportance of steadiness and the responsibility thatrests on all, and on public men in particular, toavoid panic.7.        As soon as you hear of extent to whichbank rate is raised in this country you will nodoubt take ^steps with Imperial Bank to secure risein Indian rate to extent that will at least maintainexisting difference.
