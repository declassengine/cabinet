1 .    The Cabinet resumed consideration of theMinis-t-py of Health economies and took up certain points which had been left outstanding on theprevious day.Rural Housing Act.The Minister of Health read to the Gabinetan extract from a Memorandum by the Ministry ofHealth, dated 13th March, 1931, containing figures as to the number of men likely to be employeddirectly and indirectly by the operation of theAct.      These approximated closely to those whichhe had given to the Cabinet on the previous day.He had been assured in the Ministry that theyhad not given any later figures to his predecessorvarying substantially from these.The Secretary of State for Scotland reminded the Cabinet that housing in Scotland was a gooddeal behind England.     He suggested that it wouldbe desirable, without exercising pressure,  tocontinue quietly the work on the lines of circularsalready issued.The Minister of Health wished to be in aposition to reply to enquiries from Local Authoritywho,  if they were to proceed with schemes underthe Act, would have to make applications by acertain date.      Unless they were given a hintas to the intentions of the Government,  the LocalAuthorities might continue to spend money in thepreparation of schemes.
I Previous^Reference:cabinet 49(31),Conclusion 10).a.$$tilPreviousIpference:-Cabinet 27(29)inclusion 5).The Cabinet realised that however desirableit might be to press forward with schemes under theAct, this was not practicable at the present timefor the reason that,  owing to the financial crisis,money was not available.      Any heavy expenditure wouldbe inconsistent with the general objects for whichthe Government had been formed.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed  That the policy in proceeding with the Rural Housing Act shouldbe to go slow without actuallysuspending its operation.Prolongation of Insurance Act.The Cabinet then resumed consideration of theMinister of Health&apos;s suggestion that economies,(about  100,000) might be realised by allowing the prolongation of Insurance Act to lapse.After considerable discussion the Ministerof Health agreed to accept the view of several ofhis colleagues that, for reasons of discretion, itwould be advisable to renew the Act.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prolongation of InsuranceAct should be renewed by aseparate Bill.Housing Subsidies.The Minister of Health said he required alittle more time before he could report his definiterecommendations.The question was allowed to stand over for further consideration.Chemists.The Minister of Health said he hopec1- ;oobtain  100,000 from the chemists.      No legislation was involved.

The Lord President of the Council reported thatthe First Lord of the Admiralty had consulted him as to how far he was justified in carrying out at once the decision of the Cabinet as to thereduction in dockyard wages.      Was he at liberty,in anticipation of the meeting of Parliament,  toproceed, through the usual channel of negotiation.with   the competent body?The Cabinet agreed -That the First Lord of theAdmiralty should be authorisedto proceed at once to giveeffect to the decision of theCabinet.

The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesconsulted the Gabinet on the following points which had arisen Departmentally in his effort torealise the economies proposed by the GabinetCommittee.Royal Veterinary College.In order to secure the total economy,  itwould be necessary to^e**4; the grant to theRoyal Veterinary College.     This would secure nsw^ 50,000 tk&amp;4S j6&amp;a* and  100,000^9*^4 year if ftut.Jukstfio-iricvwtAj: urw-t&amp;^agfc4^w*eeL/for two years.     He thought it mightbe accomplished amicably.The Gabinet were reminded that thereconstruction of the College was dependent onthe Government grant, and doubts were expressed asto whether tfais/was justifiable in the present state of the veterinary services in this country.The Secretary of State for Scotland said thathe was relying on a cut of  5,000 to the DickVeterinary College, a valuable institution inScotland.      If the cut was not made in the case ofthe London College, it would be difficult for himto apply this cut in Scotland.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should endeavour tosecure a/^*t*i by agreement.The Challenger Research Ship.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries reported that as part of the economies it wasprpposed to lay up the Challenger Research ship,which was not due to be completed before November.The Admiralty had reported that the ship could
be laid up at a cost of  1,000 per annum atChatham Dockyard.      The cost for retaining it in commission was from  24,000 to  25,000 a year.As the ^tnawloflo had urged strongly for this ship to be provided,  the alternative would be to invite the Trawling Association to take over thecost of the ship in commission.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should beempowered to negotiate with theTrawling Association with a viewto their maintaining theChallenger in commission.      Ifthey refused,  the ship shouldbe laid up.Agricultural Scholarships.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries reported that by curtailing agriculturalscholarships   ,a saving could be effected of 9,500 in the present year and  15,000 in the3%financial year 19^-3.5*      The scholarships hadalready been allocated to certain personswho had qualified, but they had not yet beeninformed.      His own proposal was that the selected candidates should be permitted to h?e*kdtheir scholarships but that thereafter no furtherscholarships should be awarded until further notice.This would effect a saving of  7,500 instead of 15,000 in 1952-55.The Cabinet approved the above proposal of the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries.Allotments,,The Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesOnj CL^LdUtl/OTUxU Slum.

The matter was left for theMinister to deal with   departmentally.Ordnance Survey (Land Valuation).The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries reported that the Ordnance Survey Vote included 25,000 for Land Valuation.     A supplementary estimate of  29,000 ^vsas aa^t^&amp;^^d in the present year for this Vote.The Cabinet were informed that this estimatehad been published.aAtati**^ kolilvi  4 K.o-aL  law. dtrw*,  t^fc- -Bill waa proooodod with this: would be inciLu&amp;gd..Gocdo and implements&apos;-had boon be-ght for a-ee-gta-ia-mafflte-eff-ef&apos; poeplre-.     Allotments, however, had not much to do with agriculture, and he felt it would be difficult to proceed with this item,especially as a supplementary estimate would berequired, at a time when important cuts were beingmade in expenditure on agriculture.      The general view of the Cabinet was that it would be very undesirable to have a supplementary estimate for this purpose, ee^.The Cabinet agreed  That the expenditure on allotmentsshould not be incurred, and thatthe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should do his best topresent this decision in afavourable light.Agricultural Wages.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesmentioned that he hoped to obtain an economy of 4.,000 by :ea&amp;*5^i**g t&amp;e six new agricultural wagesinspectors, who had recently been appointed inaddition to the previous staff of 15*

Relief might be obtained both thisyear and next, and it might be possible to avoid a supplementary estimate in the present year.The importance of avoiding supplementary estimates was impressed on the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that thequestion of Land Valuation was involved in the larger question of suspension of all new expenditure,which he thought should appear asa separate item on the CabinetAgenda.A^iAee^^y Farm Settlement.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said he had under consideration the desirability of closing down a farm settlement at Agfcbeeiwa-yy.The matter was left to be settled by the Minister Departmentally.Conclusion.The Cabinet approved the following recommendation of the Committee onEconomy.  millionAgriculture (England and Wales).Various savings .58

The Secretary of State for Scotland, aaidthat agriculture was a more important item inthe national economy in Scotland than in England.This increased the difficulties in making cuts.Nevertheless he hoped to achieve the economiesproposed by the Cabinet Committee, for Scottishagriculture, provided that he was not tiedto the May Committee recommendations.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the following recommendation of the Committeeon Economy:-

0NBMPL0Y1IBNTINSURANCE.(PreviousReferenceCabinet46 (31)conclusion ).The Cabinet next discussed the question ofunemployment benefit.(A) Reduction of Benefit.Attention was called to the following proposal in the Report of the Economy Committee -&quot;Reduction of benefits on schemeprepared by Ministry of Labourproducing approximately 11%.(Adult man 15/-, adult dependent 8/-   millionschildren 2/-. etc.&quot; 14.8It was pointed out that a statement by thePrime Minister in his broadcast address, would be interpreted universally to mean that the reductionof benefit was not to exceed 10%.   Consequently theadoption of a reduction &quot;producing approximately11/3&quot; would present great political difficulties andwas not acceptable.     In this connection attention was drawn to a Table drawn up in the Ministry ofLabour and submitted to the late Cabinet to illustrate, on a live register of 3,000,000 theeffect of a reduction of b% and 10% as compared  .with the present rate.     It had then been estimatedthat a 10% reduction w ould give a net saving of 12,250,000.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed : -(l) That the scheme prepared by theMinister of Labour (set out at thehead of page 2 of Appendix I to the economy Committee&apos;s Report)^toproduce approximately an 11%reduction of benefits and a saving of 14.8 m. could not be entertained.(2) To request the Minister of labour to submit for the consideration ofthe Cabinet a scale of reductions ofbenefit which will represent in eachcase,other than children&apos;s benefit,a cut in the benefit as nearly aspossible of 10%.Note.    It was hoped that this scale would produce a saving of  12,800,000.-15-
(B) Anomalies.The Cabinet were informed that the AdvisoryCommittee under the Unemployment Insurance (No.3)Act 1931, has just been fully constituted and that itwas hoped that the Committee would hold their firstMeeting about the middle of September for thepurpose of considering and reporting upon draft regulations to be laid before them by the Ministerof Labour.     Until the Regulations were operativeno economies under the Anomalies heading could berealised.The view was expressed that every effort shouldbe made to deal with the case where by arrangement with the employer the worker was employed for only part of the week, was entitled to benefit for theother part, and no contributions were payable on hisaccount.     It was pointed out, however, that duringits passage through Parliament, an amendment had been inserted in the Anomalies Bill which made it difficultto deal with this particular class of case.The Cabinet agreed :-(1) That every effort should be made tosecure a saving of at least  3 m,on Anomalies under the recent Act.(2) That the Minister of Labour should circulate to the Cabinet draft regulations under the UnemploymentInsurance (No.3) Act 1931, before putting the Regulations into operation.
(C) Increase of Contributions.After some discussion, in the course of whichthe Cabinet were reminded that the May Committeerecommendation for an all round increase ofcontributions had been tacitly accepted by employersand workpeople, the Cabinet agreed : -To adopt the recommendation of the economy Committee that thereshould be an increase of contri-butions producing a net increaseof revenue to the Fund of 10 m.(D) Further levy of 2d. on the Employed Man.The Cabinet were warned of the difficulty ofjustifying a proposal which would have the effectof raising the workers&apos;  contribution from lOd(itself an increase of 3d. on the present contribution)to l/-, and the suggestion was made that it might be preferable to secure the additional  4 m. by afurther all round increase of contributions making them lid.     It was felt, however, that this further increase would be subjected to severe criticism and opposition and that the proposal should not beaccepted unless it was found impossible to make upthe full  70 m. of economies in some other way.The Cabinet agreedThat the recommendation of the economy Committee that there shouldbe a further levy of 2d. on the employed man, giving an increasedrevenue to the Fund of  4 m. couldnot be entertained.
(E) Transitional Benefit._The Cabinet had before thera a Memorandum(Paper CP. 211 (31)) by the Ministers of Health andLabour on the provision for insured persons not entitled to ordinary benefit.The Cabinet were informed that the two ministers responsible for the Memorandum had arrivedat the conclusion that from the point of view of goodadministration and financial results, the soundestmethod of dealing with the question of transitional benefit, was that envisaged by the May Committee,namely, the transfer of this service to the PublicAssistance Authorities.    It was appreciated, however,that this course was open to very grave political objections and in these circumstances there were only two alternative^, namely (1) that the Ministry ofLabour should undertake the whole of the work - athesolution which was open to/obvious and very serious objections   set    out in the Memorandum, ana (2) the compromise recommended in CP. 211 (31) under which&quot;applications would be made to and payments made by thewhileEmployment Exchanges,/the fullest possible use would bemade of the machinery of the Public assistance authorities for the assessment of need and the finaldetermination of the amounts that should be paid&quot;.Under this scheme the whole cost of reliefwould have to be borne by the Exchequer and in orderto secure the Exchequer against abuse        regulations to control over-assessment etc. would have to been forced.While it was not practicable to give anyprecise estimate of the saving that would be effected,that saving might well be       the order of  10 ms.-18-
After some discussion, in the course of whichit was generally agreed that the solution proposed bythe Ministers of Health and Labour was probably thebest which could be found in the circumstances, theCabinet agreed  (l) To accept, as regards this question, therecommendation contained in the last paragraph of CP. 211 (31), namely :-&quot;that the Unemployment Insurance Actshe amended forthwith so that theamounts payable by the Ministry ofLabour to insured persons not entitled to ordinary benefit shallbe assessed and finally determinedby the Public Assistance Authoritiesacting for this purpose as agents ofthe Ministry of Labour;   and that negotiations with the associations of authorities be opened at once tosecure their co-operation&quot;.(2) To take note that in the view of theMinisters of Health and Labour thisarrangement would result in savings ofthe order of  10,000,000 as against the 5,000,000 mentioned in the Appendix tothe Report of the Economy Committee,(Paper CP. 208 (31)).(3) That in future the term &quot;transitionalpayment&quot; should be adopted instead of thepresent expression &quot;transitional benefit&quot;.(P) Cessation of benefit from the Fund after26 weeks.The Cabinet were informed that this merelytransferred the charge from the Fund to transitional benefit and agreed  That provision^hould be made in theforthcoming legislation to give effectto this recommendation of the EconomyCommittee.
The Cabinet were reminded that theBS        recommendations of the Economy Committee had shownD. a grand total of economies of  70,340,000.     As aresult of the Cabinet review of the Committee^recommendations, this figure had been reduced toabout  69,500,000 .      It was generally recognisedthat it was most desirable to produce a list of economies totalling at least  70,000,000, and various suggestions were made by which this endcould be attained.The Cabinet agreed : -That their list of economies should show a net total of at least 70,000,000.
6r-CELIAMEOUSloHM^KDAT IONS.vil Servicenus.reviousference:Ifbinet 41(31),Inclusion 5).The Cabinet approved the following ^recommenda-tions of the Cabinet Committee on Economy which havenot been set forth elsewhere in these conclusions:(a) That In the case of any Department requiredto effect economies In the present emergency,the Department should have discretion, afterconsultation and In agreement with theTreasury, to realise the economies in thebest manner attainable, provided that theamount so realised is not less than the economy figure as determined by the Cabinet.The economies are in general stated as the reductions which will be made in estimates for 1932.     Savings should also be effected in the current year by bringing intooperation the economy measures proposed atthe earliest possible date.Ib) That the Treasury should be invited totake every possible step, either by the issue to Departments of a special circular orotherwise, to secure the maximum possiblefigure in the category of miscellaneoussavings.(c) That the Departments concerned with economiesapproved by the Cabinet should at once placethemselves in communication with parliamentary counsel and with the Treasury.(d) To take note of and approve the following arrangements regarding Crown Servants andthe Civil Service Bonus:   ,&quot;The Committee were informed that the cutsnamed in (vV^above would not be appliedto Crown Servants whose remuneration wasbeing dealt with as recommended by the MayCommittee, and in this connection were told that the late Government had approved aproposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;that there should be no departure from thenormal operation of the Civil Service costof living scheme, and that accordingly, asfrom the 1st September next, the cost ofliving bonus should be adjusted by a reductionof 8 points in conformity with the recent fallin the cost of living Index figure.      Inconveying this conclusion to those concerned,it should be intimated that this reductionof remuneration may be regarded as their contribution to the national emergency.&apos;&quot;(e) To take note of the statement of thelegislation that will be required to giveeffect the economy proposals(CP. 208(31), Appendix II.)Note:     The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thatin addition legislation would be requiredin regard to the Police.
