(In the absence of the Prime Minister,who was indisposed, the Lord Presidentof the Council took the Chair.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported thatthe banks wished to have authority to refuse foreign jexchange except for normal trade requirements,Iexisting contracts and reasonable travelling.    Heread a draft Order to this effect.   The Ambassadorsof the United States and Prance had agreed in theOrder.    Foreign banks in London had agreed toco-operate in carrying it out.A suggestion was made that, while this might besufficient for the moment, it would be desirable forthe Treasury to consider the question of takingpowers to enforce it later on, if necessary.The Cabinet approved the issue of the following:-,;ORDER MADE BY THE TREASURY UNDERSECTION 1  (3)  OF THE GOLD STANDARD(AMENDMENT)  ACT,  19 31.The Lords Commissioners of HisMajesty&apos;s Treasury in purs via nee of section 13)  of the Gold&quot; Standard (Amendment) Act19 31 hereby order that until further noticepurchases of foreign exchange, or transfers of funds with the object of acquiring suchexchange directly or indirectly, by Britishsubjects or persons resident in the UnitedKingdom shall be prohibited except the for purpose of financing(l) normal trading requirements(2) contracts existing before September21st,  1931(3) reasonable travelling or otherpersonal purposes.PHILIP SNOWDENGEORGE PENNYTwo of the Lords commissioners of the Treasury.

The President of the Board of Trade made a detailed report to the Gabinet of the position as tocertain supplies of food and their prices.   The position was reassuring as to bread, meat, tea Mad aragap, andno rise in price appeared to be probable during thenext month &amp;r apart from a small rise that hadtalc en place in the cost of tea owing to an internaltrade dispute unconnected with the financial crisi^.There was a glut of tinned f-oodo in the country.   Asmall rise had taken place in the p2&quot;&apos;ice of butter and cheese, but this was seasonal and unconnected withthe crisis .    The position as to oils and fats was&quot;more&quot;uhc er t a in.    Further enquiries were being made/1He gave satisfactory reports of the willingness ofthe various trades dealing with foodstuffs to co-operate in maintaining existing price levels for thepres ent.The Cabinet took note with satisfaction of thePresident of the Board of TradeVs report.   They were reminded that this information would be useful in the debate on the Economy Bill.   The Government mightfairly claim that the prompt action of the Presidentof the Board of Trade in bringing together the repre-sentatives of the food trades and securing their goodwill had helped to steady the situation.    To the criticism that the economies were no longer jvistifiedin view of the probable rise in prices, the replycould be that no earl]/&quot; rises wrere expected/and thatthe Government were closely watching the situationand would deal with it as circumstances required.
CHINA.JapaneseAction in manchuria.(previous reference:Cabinet SO(28), Con-clusion 5.)F.R.4-   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that China had requested theLeague to take up the question of the occupation ofMukden by the Japanese, and Viscount Cecil had askedfor instructions .   The Secretary of State had approvedthat Viscount Cecil&apos;s aim should be to secure a withdrawal of troops behind a certain line, on thebasis laid down in the Model Treaty.    Observers, whowould probably be Military Attaches, would be    sentthere to see that this requirement was complied with.On a proposal that the United States should be pressed to support this action he had given instructions thatWashington should be informed of our own attitude.The Secretary of State had that morning informed theJapanese Ambassador of the line he was taking.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
DISARMAMENT. 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairaconsulted the Cabinet as to the reply to be given to(previous reference: a telephone message received late on the previous cabinet 57(31), Con- evening from Viscount Cecil, at Geneva, asking forelusion 4.)instructions as to the position he should adoptr. ./ v towards Signor Grandi&apos;s proposal for a holiday inarmaments for a year.   The proposal had now beendefined, and provided:    for the Army, that everyoneshould agree not to increase their expenses alreadyvoted for the current year:    for the Navy, not to lay down any new ships, but that any which had beenbegun may be finished:    for the Air, not to constructnew aircraft except to replace those which go out ofservice during the period of the truce;   this to last for one year, and to take the form of a SolemnDeclaration, not a Convention, by all the Governments.The Cabinet discussed the question at some length with the Ministers of the Defence Departments,and approved that the Italian proposal should beaccepted, subject to the following:-(a) The exclusion from the proposal ofthe ships in the Admiralty&apos;s building programme for 19 30 which have not been&quot;laid down&quot; in the technical sense ofthe word although they have been ordered, contracts placed, andmaterial collected for their con-struction:(b) To meet the requirements of the Armyand Air Force, which are in many respects depleted, it should bemade clear that in undertaking notto increase the current Estimates weshould reserve our position in thecase of unforeseen events involvingincreased expenses, or if, owing tothe de-valuation of the   sterling,the cost of armaments should increase:(c) It must be made clear that in theevent of a failure of the DisarmamentConference to achieve results, the armaments holiday would not remainin operation:
(d) That the precise language of the communication to Viscount Cecilshould be agreed between theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Ministers at thehead of the Defence Services (who retired to an adjoining room forthis purpose).The Lord President invited theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs to draft replies to twoParliamentary Questions that hadbeen put to the Prime Minister onthe subject discussed above.
MIRALTYCONOMIES .previous reference erene e:Cabinet 61(31), Con-clusion 1.)m.6.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the Gabinet that, according to reports received upto date, the effects of the Prime Minister&apos;s announce-ment in Parliament on the previous day (See cabinet minute referred to in the margin) had been satisfactoryso far as the Navy was concerned.
balance oftrade .(previous reference reference e:Cabinet 59(31) .)f.R.7.   The Lord President of the Council suggestedthat as this item had been placed on the Agenda bythe Prime Minister it would be desirable to keep it back until his return.
8.    The Secretary of State for India reported to theCabinet that when the decision was taken to go off theGold Standard a meeting had taken place betweenfinancial experts of the India Office and theTreasury, which Lord Reading had joined at a later stage, when it nad been agreed as essential to keepthe rupee tied, not to gold, but to sterling.      TheController of Currency from India, who was on leavein this country, had also agreed in this course.A telegram to this effect had been sent to India.On the following day, however, news was received that an Ordinance had been issued in India leaving therupee unpegged either in sterling or gold.Fortunately most of the world Exchanges were closed -at the time when this was issued.      The Secretary ofState himself had made a statement to the Round-table conference explaining that the rupee must be tied to sterling.      The next development had been the re.eed.ptof a telegram from India stating that if we insisted on tying the rupee to sterling India would require a 50 million Gredit to maintain the rupee.      TheCommittee of Financial Experts had then met again andhad reaffirmed their view that it was most important to keep the rupee tied to sterling;    otherwise therupee must inevitably crash.      The Treasury agreed and were prepared, subject to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer?s concurrence,  to say that the suspension of the Gold Standard did not affect the PrimeMinister&apos;s conditional undertaking to give Indiafinancial assistance should need arise, so long as theGovernment of India adhered to the established policyof maintaining the rupee at 1s.6d.      The Government
of India&apos;s justification for its attitude was that so long as the rupee was tied to sterling the valueof the rupee could not be maintained.      The IndiaOffice experts did not share this view.The Gabinet agreed with theSecretary of State for india that it was important that therupee should remain tied to sterling, and that the PrimeMinister&apos;s undertaking ofJune 26th should be confirmed.
Th-c Cabinet a-grecd with th-secretary of State fo^-lndiathat it was imporj^anx that therupee should^remain tied tosterline,^ahd that the PrimeMinos-fee?&apos;&apos;s undertaking of Junefrfl^hT-ohould bo confirmed.Indianudget.49. The Secretary of State for India reportedthat the Government of India were now prepared to balance the Budget and were trying to carry out hisown proposal to deal with the protected Services bycuts on a voluntary basis corresponding to a compul-sory cut on all officers not protected.   The Govern-ment of India, however, had strongly resisted theproposed Excise Duty, and the Secretary of State was advised that for political reasons this could not be imposed.   The Secretary of State had felt it proper,after consultation with the President of the Boardof Trade, to make an appeal to the Viceroy to increase from 31 per cent, to 40 per cent, the Duty on foreignimported cotton goods, thus giving a Preference toBritish cotton goods.   An analogous increase had beenmade on foreign silk, which had given him an oppor-tunity to make this suggestion.    In any event he had asked the Viceroy that in the Budget Speech the indian government should not be committed to an increasedCotton Duty without announcing either an Exciseor a Preference to British cotton goods.The President of the Board of Trade gave theCabinet particulars of appeals he had received fromLancashire on this subject.The Cabinet were reminded that this overwhelmingburden on British trade was being imposed at a timewhen the British people were making sacrifices tomaintain India&apos;s financial credit.
The Gabinet authorised the Secretaryof State for India to send a further telegram to the Viceroy stating thathe had now discussed the matter withthe Cabinet, who attached importanceto his proposal.
DUMPING wpreviousReference:Cabinet 40(31), Con-elusion 11,)10. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn tothe following Question to be addressed in Parliamentto the President of the Board of Trade:-&quot;Mr Wardlaw-Milne - to of the Board of Tradeask the Presidentwhether theGovernment are taking^ or intend totake, any steps to prevent the dumpingof Foreign produce into this Countrycaused by the expectation of theimposition of Duties at an earlydate&quot; .The following reply was approved:-every Britishtime, to&quot;It is the plain duty ofcitizen, at the present time, to giveall the help he can to British industry by buying British goods.    Anyone whoimports foreign goods unnecessarilyis rendering a real dis-service tohis country;    and the Government are confident that both individual buyersand traders will recognise this commonobligation&quot;.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,September 82, 1931.
Exchanges.The Dollar opened at ahout 4.84, the lowestpoint oi&apos; the day,  and closed at 4.84 20/25.      There 7/as little,business done.The Franc opened very nominal at about 119 andfell to 102/4 but closed at 108/10., There have hardly been any quotations for other currencies and no dealings, though closing x^nices, which were very nominal, were stated to be as follows -ParMark 18/19 20.43Florin 11.00/11.001 12.1Swiss Franc 21/21.30 25,22Belga 31/33 35.Stock Exchange.The Stock Exchange has been closed all day and practically no business seems to have taken place outside.One small transaction in War Loan at 90 was heard of.The Stock Exchange will remain closed to-morrowwhen the question of reopening will be further considered.The Sub-Committee of the Committee for General Purposes considerthat if arrangements can be made for the continuance of existingloans without the provision of further cover, the reopening ofthe market would be greatly facilitated.      It is understood thatthe Banks have agreed to extend existing loans for a furthermonth on the basis of the prices of Saturday last without asking for further cover.A report from Basle states that the general feeling is very good and there is no recrimination.      People areworried but most friendly.      It is rumoured there that Hungary and
Austria are &quot;both considering the question of a generalmoratorium.In Switzerland the Bourse was open but dealingsin foreign securities and foreign exchange were suspended;a similar state of affairs existed in Brussels.      The Boursewas closed in Vienna, Berlin and Amsterdam but in Paris was open under certain -limitations.Money Market.There was a good deal of pressure for moneyearly in the morning but steps were taken by the Bank ofEngland to see that the market was adequately supplied withfunds and only trifling recourse to the Bank was necessary.Reports from the Provinces state that completecalm has prevailed and that business has proceeded just as usual.      The admirable attitude of the Press this morninggreatly contributed to this.At a meeting held at the Bank the London offices of foreign banks,  other than the Prench and American banks, with/hom arrangements had been nade by their respective Ambassadors,agreed to work in cooperation with the London banks in therestriction of operations in foreign exchange on behalf ofBritish nationals.The Bank of Pittsburg National Association withCapital $3,000,000 and deposits ^55.000.000 is reported to have failed.A late report says all quiet in Stockholm.21st September,  1931.
