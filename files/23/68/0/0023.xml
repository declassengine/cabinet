FUTUREGOVERNMENTPOLICY.f previous reference:Cabinet 69;on-(51),elusion 4.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe efforts he had been making ever since the last meeting had not reso.lted in agreement on a formulaon control of imports, by tariffs or otherwise, onwhich the National Government could go.to the country on a united platform.   There were, therefore,  three possible courses open to the National Government:-(i) To break up into its constituentParties:(ii) To remain in office without a GeneralElestion, boldly to confront criticsand to put in hand the national and international measures necessary forthe stabilisation of the   sterling and the establishment of British credit,incltiding those necessary to restore the balance of trade:(iii) To go to the country on the generalpolicy on which the Cabinet were unanimous, leaving discretion to thevarious Parties to deal with controlof imports and tariffs on their ownlines.The first course did not commend itself to theCabinet.   The news from the City was not satisfactory;the value of the   sterling had depreciated and theprincipal Government Stocks were falling.   PromGermany and other foreign countries disquietingreports were being received.    In these circumstances it was felt unanimously that the National government must not relinquish its task, and there was an earnestdesire to find a basis of agreement.   It was recognisedalso that with every day&apos; s. delay the situation was deteriorating and that a decision was necessary that evening.Against the second c&apos;course strong objections wereurged.   Whether the country as a whole desired aGeneral Election or not, it was generally known athome and abroad that the Cabinet for more than a week
had been trying to reach agreement as to the programme onwhich it could go to the country.    If a decision were now taken to remain in office it would be known that the realcause was failure to reach agreement.    In such circum-stances the Cabinet, it was felt, would not possess theconfidence at home and abroad or the security of tenurenecessary to enable it to carry through the national and international measures to stabilise the   sterling,including the promotion of an International Conference on, currency problems.In these circumstances the Prime Minister felt that aGeneral/ Election must be held and that the National government must appeal for a mandate to take all measures for the stabilisation of the   sterling, with nothing excluded.The Parties composing the National Government must be leftdiscretion to deal with the question of restriction ofimports and of tariffs each in its own way   a course which,  it was pointed out, was by no means unknown in political life abroad.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should recommend the Fing to prorogue and dissolve Parlia-ment on&quot;Wednesday, October 7.   Accordingto a calculation sxibmitted to the Prime&apos;Minister by the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Treasury, this would result inNomination Day on Friday, October 16, andPolling Day on Tuesday, October 27.(b) That the date tov be inserted in the Proclama-tion for the Dissolution of Parliament forthe re-assembly of the new Parliament shovildbe Tuesday, November 3.   The election of the speaker would take place, and the swearing-inof Members would begin, on that date&apos;.   the address would be moved on Monday, November 9.(NOTES.    (i) The date to be inserted in the Prorogation Order-in Council for the re-assembly of Parliament isa purely nominal one, as Parliament will be dissolvedimmediately after Parliament has risen.   Tuesday,October 27, is the nominal date to be inserted inthe Order.(ii) It is possible to postpone the date of re-assemblyof Parliament later, if desired.)
(c) That the Prime Minister should issue a Manifesto setting forth the general policy of the national government.   This should contain astatement of the policy, on whichthe Cabinet are unanimous, for the stabilisation of the   sterling andfor establishing British credit, andshould ask for a free hand, nothingexcluded.   The question of restric-tion of imports by tariffs or other-wise should be dealt with in general terms, and no attempt should be madeto embody an agreed formula.Latitude should be left to theLeaders of the three Parties todeal with this question in theirown statements of policv(d) That the Prime Minister, the LoraPresident of the Council and theHome Secretary should meet on thefollowing day at 12 noon to considerthe Prime Minister&apos;s Manifesto.(e) That the Secretary to the cabinet should inform the Clerk of the Crownat once that the Writs for the GeneralElection should be ready for issueon Wednesday, October 7.(f) That no official announcement ofthe above decisions should be madeto the Press until the Prime minister had seen the King.   The announcement would be made in Parliament, probably on Wednesday, October 7.    In view ofthe great public interest in thematter, however, there was noobjection to its becoming known atonce that the Cabinet had reached agreement.(g) To congratulate the Prime minister on the successful issue of hisunremitting efforts to obtainunanimity.
