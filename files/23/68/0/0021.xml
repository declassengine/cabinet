,gg COLORADO^opos edponibitionIf ImportI potatoes,to., frompane e.1 .The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP .-256(31)) drawing attention to the rapid spread of theColorado Beetle in France towards the Channel, whichhad caused much alarm among potato growers here.   he proposed the following measures for the protectionof our crops(i) Complete prohibition of the entry ofFrench potatoes, for the whole year.(ii) Prohibition of the entry of nurserystock and living plants, if grownwithin 200 kilometres from an outbreak, also for the whole year.(iii) Prohibition of the entry of rawvegetables (including salads, tomatoesand aubergines) if grown within 200kilometres of an outbreak, but only for the period from the 15th march to the 14th October, when the Beetleis active.The result would be to keep out French imports tothe value of about  1,000,000, or slightly more.This compared with a total of imports from Francelast year of  49,000,000.   To meet a small Treatycomplication it might be necessary, as a matter of form, to bring Orders relating to the United Statesinto line with Orders relating to France.The Department of Agriculture for Scotland andthe Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland wereunderstood strongly to support the measures proposed above, and the Foreign Office and the Board of trade were reported not to object to them if they were considered necessary.The French Ministry of Agriculture had asked tobe allowed to discuss the whole subject with theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries before action was taken, and the Minister was expecting to see their representatives in London early next week.Before seeing them he asked for the general approvalof the Cabinet to the above proposals.
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesinformed the Cabinet that if the French pressed for it one or two trivial concessions might be madeon his proposals without any grave addition to ourrisk.   Possibly the district round Avignon might be excluded for a time.    It was pointed out, however,that if that were done there was a risk that producefrom the prohibited areas might be brought into theAvignon district for exportation.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was asked to consider once more and assure himself asto whether it was necessary to prohibit the importa-tion of nursery stock, living plants and raw vege-tables from so large an area as 200 kilometres froman outbreak.The Cabinet approved generally the policy proposed by theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries in CP.-256 (SI)  .
KEW.jhe RoyalBotanicalGardens .proposed FreeAdmission of school children under instruc-tion.2.   The Prime Minister availed himself of thepresence of the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries to draw attention to a Question in Parliament on theprevious day, asking if, for revenue purposes, afee for admission to the Royal Botanical Gardensat Kew could he re-imposed.   The Minister had repliedthat he had decided to re-impose, as from Monday next, an admission fee of Id. except on Students&apos;Days, when the admission fee would continue to he6d, and on the four Bank Holidays when admissionwould be free.The Prime Minister said he had been informedthat teachers of botany in schools were in the habit of conducting classes of school-children tothe Royal Botanical Gar-dens, thus combininginstruction with a day in the open air.    It hadbeen represented to him that the charge of an admission fee would put an end to this desirableform of instruction.The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries was requested by theCabinet to examine whether itwould be possible to remit the fee in the ease of children under instruction.    If he foundthis possible it was suggestedthat he should announce his decision in reply to a question in Parliament.
FUTUREGOVERNMENrPOLICY.(previous reference:Cabinet 67(31), Con-conclusion 8.)3. The Cabinet resigned their discussion on thefuture policy of the Government.The Secretaries of State for Home Affairs andForeign Affairs, who had separately conferred withMr Lloyd George at Churt in the interval since theprevious Meeting of the Cabinet, informed their colleagues of the results of their consultations.The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss the natureof the programme on which an appeal to the country might be made by the National Government.At 7.30 p.m. an adjournment was made for thepreparation of a draft formula by a Committee composed iof the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and theMinister of Health.On resumption at 10.45 p.m. the Prime minister informed the Cabinet that the Committee had prepared a formula, the Home Secretary having stated that his assent was provisional, pending consultation with hiscolleagues .The Lord President of the Council said that heand his Conservative colleagues were prepared toaccept it.The Nome Secretary and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that in the very brief interval,about a quarter of an hour, since the completion &quot;ofthe formula, they had discussed it with Ministers whowere members of the Liberal Party     There had not been sufficient time, however, for them to consider pro-perly the important points raised.Stress was laid on the political importance ofan early decision, but in the circumstances theCabinet agreed to adjourn until the following day, Friday, October 2nd, at 2.30 pfm., on the
understanding that there should be a definite decision at that meeting, and that, if the LiberalMinisters were not in a position to present their reply on the formula, it should be assumed that their answer is in the negative.The Prime Minister asked that the utmostreticence might be observed by all concerned as tothe content of the formula.
THE KING&apos;SSPEECH.(previous reference:Cabinet 63(30), Con-clusion 1 &amp;Appendix.)f-R.7^2.4. The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues that in the event of prorogation of Parliament beingdecided on, a King&apos;s Speech would be required.He suggested that the Secretary to the cabinet should be instructed to collect the material.   he proposed that the KingTs Speech should be very briefand limited to Bills which had been passed in thepresent Session of Parliament to meet the emergency,together with a reference to the Indian Round-table conference and the Foodstuffs (Prevention of ExploLta-tion) Bill., Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 1, 1931.
