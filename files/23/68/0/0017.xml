IjB INDIAN 1.   The Se-criErtary.-.of-Stat-e- or^. Jndixuo^por-ted  that,  owing no doubt to the crisis in connection:e Increasedluty on with the value o^ the rupee, he had as yet receivedjip or t ed[otton Piece no reply to his appeal to the Viceroy to increaseoodsfrom 31 per cent, to 40 per cent, the Duty on foreignprevious imported cotton piece goods, thus giving a PreferenceReference:Cabinet 62 to British cotton goods.     He had sent a further(31), Oon-clusion 9.) telegram asking for a reply.   His intention had been,in the event of a refusal on the part of the Viceroy,by^/jtf-. to consult the Gabinet once more before the Viceroymade his Budget Statement.    It was essential that theIndian Budget should be introduced on Monday,September 28th.   He now wished to consult the cabinet as to what was to be his attitude if the Viceroytelegraphed a refusal.    He warned his colleagues that he was interdicted by the Fiscal AutonomyConvention from, imposing the cabinet view on theViceroy on a question of Preference.   There were some slight mitigations in the full effect of the increased;    Duties:    first, owing to the decision of the indian government to impose a Duty on foreign raw cotton  a slight alleviation only - and, second, the effectof-the fall in sterling, which would place our foreign competitors at a considerable disadvantage in theIndian market.The Cabinet were reminded that on February 12.1950, the Government of India had been prepared to propose that the application of increased duties should be limited to non-British goods.The Gabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forIndia should, without waiting forthe Viceroy&apos;s reply, send a furtherPrivate and Personal telegram inform-ing him that the Cabinet had again been considering the question ofCotton Duties, particularly in the
light of the Viceroy rs tele grain ofFebruary 12,  19 30 (101-S),  in whichhe had been prepared to propose thatthe application of increased Dutiesmight be limited to non-British goods.Thia was exactly the line of the&apos;proposal that had been made to theViceroy, that in increasing theDuties the increase on non-british goods should be higher than the Dutyon British goods.   The Viceroy wasto be reminded, by reference toprevious telegrams, of the enormousimportance which the Cabinet attachedto a difference in the increasedDuties as between British and non-British goods, and the hope shouldbe expressed that he would see his way to apply this differentiationin any increase of these duties which it was necessary to propose:(b) That if the Viceroy found it impossibleto adopt these suggestions, there wasno alternative but to allow the IndianBud.get to be introduced without them.
RY OP&quot; EOONO-trationuranees -OVLS&apos;ence:.et 49Con-xon 10.)2. The Minister of Health reminded the Cabinetthat when the cuts to certain branches of the PublicService were limited to not more than 10 per cent.(Cabinet fjl (31), Conclusion 1), he had given warning that difficulties with the Insurance Doctors were tobe anticipated.    Since then the Insurance Acts Gom-mittee had come to see him and had reminded him thatthey had accepted the reduction in the doctors&apos;remuneration from 9/- to 8/- on the understandingthat no-one else would be let off.    They now pressed for a reduction in the cuts to doctors.    One of thereasons they gave had been that the capitation feesdid not&apos; represent the net income of medical men, whohad other expenses incidental to their profession.He had replied that the public would not accept that reason.   As a result of the interview, however, hehad seen the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had agreed to accept a cut of 10 per cent, instead of a deduction of one-ninth, as set forth in the white paper (Cmd. 3952 (1931)).    He had then informed theIns\france Acts Committee by letter that this altera-tion would be sanctioned.   The Insurance Acts Committeehad come to him again and said they could not recommend the doctors to accept this concession, but he proposedto hold to the 10 per cent, and had made a statement to that effect in Debate the same day.The Cabinet took note of, and approved,the above arrangements.
POLICE.Economies in pay of.[previous reference:Cabinet 61(51), Con-conclusion ion 1.)3. The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thatthe Police cut was proceeding satisfactorily.   TheMetropolitan Police had asked permission to hold a protest Meeting at the Albert Hall, but he thoughtthat too much importance need not be attached tothis, and the Chief Commissioner of Police had recommended that it should be permitted.   The recentconcession had given satisfaction.-4-
