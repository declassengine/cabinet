ffiOQNOMY. I.&quot;with reference to the conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had beforeReduction in       them the following documents relative to service pay and Pensions.certain questions of reductions in service pay and Pensions which had arisen in connectionwith the Governments Economy proposals:-A Memorandum by the First Lord of(Previous                       the Admiralty       (Paper CP. 352(31)).reference cabinet A Memorandum by the Secretary of State52 (31) for Air (Paper CP. 254(31)) and conclusion 6).A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War       (P;.-.per CP. 255(31)).The questions for determination by the Cabinetraised in these documents were :-(l) Pay:    the precise interpretation of the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement in the House of Commons on 21stSeptember, 1931, which was as follows:-&quot;The Prime Minister:    The Governmenthave, as announced by me on Wednesdaylast, been examining details of theproposed scheme of reductions.    Thereare undoubtedly classes of personswho are unfairly affected, and theGovernment have, in view of all thecircumstances, come to the conclusionthat the simplest way of removing justgrievances is to limit reductions asregards teachers, police, and thethree Defence Services, to not morethan 10 per cent.    This decision willnot apply to the higher ranks ofcommissioned officers in the defence services.     The balance of the Budgetwill be maintained.&quot;(2)    Pensions:      the proposed change ofpension conditions for men who havealready entered into their finalengagement to complete time for pension.lo
(3)   The Period of Grace for men todecide as to re-engagement.In addition, the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War informed the Cabinet of the course which the War Office and the Air Ministry proposed totake as to the Reserve pay and emoluments of kindredclasses.(l) Pay - the interpretation of the 10 per centdecision - On tins question the First Lord of health  himself andthe Admiralty emphasised that/all concerned with theNavy ,/had construed the Prime Minister&apos;s statement to mean that &quot;the men now receiving the 1919 scales of pay would continue to receive the se scales of pay for the future and in whatever ratingthey might hold, subject to a reduction whichwould be limited to 10/-6&quot;, and drew attention tothe grave disappointment in the Naval Service-which would result if this interpretation was rejected.     At the same time the Board ofAdmiralty did not see the same objection to a limitation of the concession to a man&apos;s presentService engagement on the ground that it wouldnot be regarded as unfair that a man should berequired to accept changed conditions as regardspay and pension when he comes to re-engage fora further periodsThe Secretary of State for War was in generalagreement,so far as ,this question was concerned, withthe First Lord*s interpretation of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.
The Secretary of State for Air, in his Memorandum,maintained that the concession announced by the Prime minister was intended merely to limit the immediate reduction to besuffered by an individual on the 1st October next, and that it did not secure to him the continuance of 1919 rates less 10%on completion of a further incremental period or on promotion to a higher rating:    in other words that the intention was to guarantee to a man that he shall in no circumstances receive a lower rate of substantive pay than his current 1919 rate less10 per cent.      It was urged by Lord Amulree in support of thisview (l) that the concession had been made for the purposeof relieving hardship:    (2)  that the greatly Increased costof the Admiralty and War Office interpretation was unfair tothe Exchequer:    (3)  that acceptance of this interpretationmay  produce repercussions in the case of other classes ofState and other public Servants; and (4) that as regards theAir Ministry there was no prospect of finding additional savings to fill the gap.(2) Pensions - In this case the First Lord of theAdmiralty contended that the Government should reverse the decision that men already in their final engage-ment qualifying them for pension shall not have thebenefit of the scheme in force when they enteredupon that engagement, but shall be pensioned on adifferent basis which reduced the amount of pensionthat t he Governmentin some cases by as much as 16?6, and/should revert to the principle of the May Committee&apos;s recommendation as laid do?/n in the White Paper, namely that &quot;thepensions rates of men in the Service will in future be determined by the scheme in force at the date when the man enters   upon his final
engagement which qualifies him for pension&quot;.The Secretaries of State for War and Air, on theother hand, favoured the retention of the GovernmentTsdecision in the matter, on the understanding that the concession that service prior to October 1st (or thedate specified) should count at the 1919 rates, stands.(3) Period of Grace.   The Secretary of State forWar agreed v/ith the First Lord that menalready eligible, to re-engage on or before september 30, 1931, should be allowed someperiod after September 30 within which todecide whether to re-engage, and that ifthey do so within that period they  shouldbe allowed to earn pension at the same ratesas men already re-engaged. The Secretary ofState for Air was prepared to acquiesce inthis concession, but warned the Cabinet thatthe result might be to encourage applications from men, who might not otherwise have done so, to re-engage and secure the benefit ofthe higher rate of pension.T% was suggested that, in interpreting and apply-ing directions of this kind, the Defence services should do so after consultation with one another.The Cabinet agreed  -PAY.(a) That, in view of the widespread acceptancethroughout the ranks of the Wavy and army of the following interpretation of thePrime Minister&apos;s statement, namely, that&quot;The men now receiving the 1919 scales of pay will continue to receive these scalesfor the future and in whatever rating orrank they might hold, subject to a reduc-tion which would be limited to 10 per cent&quot;,it would be politically impossible to placeany other construction on the statement.Since in some cases important categories of personnel would be worse off than underthe original decision, the option of the19S5 rates should continue to be giventhroughout a man&apos;s career until re-engagement.
(b) To take note that the three defence departments are agreed in any case that on entering into a fresh agreement,that is to say, on extension of service or on re-engagement, sailors, soldiersand airmen who enlisted before October,1925, shall come on to the 1925 scales of pay.PENSIONS.(e) That the pension rates of men in theDefence Services discharged to pensionin future shall be determined by thescheme in force at the date when theman enters upon his final engagementwhich qualifies him for pension.(d) That men already in the final term of engagement shall receive on dischargea pension   on the 1919 scale in respectof the whole of their service.(e) That men who were eligible on the 30thSeptember, 19 31, to re-engage shouldbe allowed a period of grace, suited to the needs of the Service, in which to decide whether to re-rengage or not.G EN E R A L.(f) That the Admiralty should be authorisedto subscribe a sum of  5,000 to the royal naval Benevolent Trust, in order to ease the hardships in the case of some of the married men under 25 (who do not receivemarriage allowance) whose pre-1925 rates are being cut, on the understanding thatthe subscription would be smaller nextyear and would disappear the year after.(g) That the First Lord of the Admiralty, in replying to Parliamentary Questions onthe subject, should,  if possible, confinehimself to mentioning his intention toissue an Order to the Fleet, but if heshould find himself compelled to give further details, should make clear thatthe new Orders are in pursuance of thePrime minister&apos;s pledge.   He should avoidmentioning the subscription to the royal naval Benevolent Trust.(h) To take note that, owing to the rise inthe price of petrol and the generalpressure on Air Votes, the Secretaryof State for Air did not expect to beable to find additional savings to compensate for the expenditure involvedin the above decisions.   The Secretaryof State was asked to do his utmost inthe matter.- o-
2. The Gabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP.-251 (31)) asking theapproval of the Cabinet to a draft of Regulations(copies of which were attached to the Memorandum) tobe made under the Unemployment Insiirance (Anomalies)Act, 1931, which he was anxious to make without delay in order to realise the consequent economies in Benefit.The Cabinet authorised the Ministerof Labour to make the Regulationsattached to CP.-251 (31)).
OBEI&amp;N 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-FAIRS .said that a few days ago he had had conversationsPf opos edsit to with the American and French -Ambassadors on thevis bye Secretary   subject of a statement made in Parliament by theChancellor of the Exchequer as to the desirabilityssibleternational   of an International Conference on Currency.    Thenf erenceCurrency.     French Ambassador, who, he thought, had previously^&amp;C3^5-. consulted with the American Ambassador, had suggestedwevi previous reference:       that as M. Laval was leaving for Washington onabinet 6031), Con-       October 12th it might be desirable^ before he left,conclusion 83).) for him to have an informal conversation with thePj^ Secretary of State.   After consultation with the^(jjy. Prime Minister the Secretary of State had intimated that if he were invited to visit Paris he would accept.   His visit would have to take place early next week, after M. Laval&apos;s return from Berlin and before he left for Washington.   The Secretary ofState was at present discussing with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the nature of the subjects to bediscussed on his visit to Paris .
Uvg INDIANBUDGET .I Cot ton Duties(previous reference erence:Gabinet 64(31), Con-conclusion ion 1.)4.The Gabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (C.P.-249 (31)) circulate-ing for the information of his colleagues copies ofprivate and personal telegrams exchanged with theViceroy on September 26th. on the subject of CottonDuties.
5. After the President of the Board of trade had explained to the Cabinet the measures he hadtaken to secure the co-operation of trade interestsin keeping the price of food as low as possible,and had indicated that nevertheless rises in pricesof bacon and some other foodstuffs must be expected in the near future, the Cabinet discussed the questionof the advisability, before Parliament rises, of taking powers to deal with, any case of exploitationthat might arise   although there was no evidenceof such at the present time.   There was generalagreement that it would not be advisable to obtainthese powers by an amendment to the Emergency Act,since that Act could only be put in operation by royal Proclamation declaring an emergency.    It was thought that all that was necessary could be achieved by a short Bill on the analogy of Clause 1 (3) of theGold Standard (Amendment) Act, 1931, and limited toa fixed period of time, such as six months.The Cabinet agreed  That a short Bill should be passedduring the present Session ofParliament to deal with thepossibility of exploitation of thepublic in essential  foodstuffs..

Tlae Prime Minister raised the question as towhether Departments were satisfied that the one month provided for in the Economy Bill allowedsufficient time for the preparation and carefulscrutiny of the various Orders in Council that hadto be issued.    If there were any doubts on thequestion it would be necessary to ask the House ofLords to extend the period from one month to twomonths.The Cabinet were informed that all Departmentsconcerned had expressed themselves as satisfied with the time allowed, and that several of theOrders in Council were included in the business ofthe Meeting of the Privy Council arranged for thefollowing morning.-11-

APPENDIX.BUSINESS OP THE HOUSE.The National Economy Bill has passed this house and by the end of the present week we hope to obtain theFinance Bill and the necessary Supplementary Estimates.The only business in view at the moment which will thenremain to be disposed of before this session can bebrought to  an end isthe Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill andthe Sunday Performances (Temporary Regulation) BillIt would appear quite feasible for this business to be concluded by 7/wednesday next:-Monday Sunday Performances Bill; 2nd Reading.5th Oct.Tuesday Sunday Performances Bill; Committee &amp;6th Oct, 3rd Reading.Appropriation Bill; 2nd Reading.Wednesday Appropriation Bill; remaining stages.7th Oct.There will also be a short Bill to deal with the-possibility of exploitation of the public in articles offood of general consumption.      I feel that this will meet with general approval and not require much parliamentary time.If any additional business is necessary anannouncement will be mad-   at a later date.
