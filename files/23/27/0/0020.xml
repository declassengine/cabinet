would have entered upon a general -dJ^cu&amp;sion- -of the variouslarge outatanding^e^*onomio-questions, including the questionof inter-allied debts.     At such a discussion it wouldhave been possible for Great Britain ih the event, of theUnited States of America agreeing to a dahoellation of herEuropean indebtedness, to havevsimilarly cancelled the debtsowed to her by the Allies, and also possibly to have foregoneany claim to further reparation from Germany, Except claims in respect of actual damage sustained.     A policy of this character would have left Prance in a position to obtain . .from Germany reparation for her devastated&apos;regions.     M... .Lcucheur had been willing to entertain proposals $ this character, and It was not out of the question that he mighthave been willing, c s part of a general settlement,, to foregothe French pension claim against Germany^&apos;As a result of tentative enquiries made in responsiblequartersi it was, however, certain that any suggestion to   .the United States Government to enter upon discussions ofthis character would meet with a very hostile reception. ....While certain of the mercantile and&apos;trading classes In theEastern States might be favourable to some general arrange-.ment, the view of the great majority of Americans: was that. . ,the debts should be paid, and that the failure to paythem was the primary cause of the present distress In the.United. States.     The attitude of the Finance Committee of.the senate, was of a similar character^ and in a recent discussion on the subject of the funding of Allied Pebts, that Committeehad laid down that such funding should be subject to the.,condition that there should be ho cancellation, either of .interest.or principal, and that there should be - no acceptance,by the United States Treasury of the Bonds of one country,in satisfaction of the American debt of another.     In thesecircumstances, American participation in any general
smaller problem of German   rep*cr*rtichoThe position as regards German reparation was ,thaton-the 15 th January and 15th February nox^y Germany wealdhave to find two inatalments amaunting to a sum of SO ta 35millions sterlingf and it was pretty clear that the utmostthat in the present circumstances the German Government could produce would be  10 to  12 millions.tr:    In the main the money would have to go to Belgium by reason of her priority0     Itmust be borne-In mind that France was&apos; at present&apos;receivingreparation Coal on very lucrative termsf and. in fact she wasonly being debited in the accounts Of the Reparation commission for-coal at a price of 8/4. per ton.     Notwithstanding the-great&apos; size and extravagant cost of her Army of Occupation.., the,amount received by her in respect of German coal Was merethan sufficient to pay for the cost of the Army of Occupation.If Germany defaulted on the instalments, the question arose whether she should be granted a moratorium^     Undoubtedly...her inability, to pay was due to a very large extent to her ownaction.     As a result of the generous subsidies given by theGerman Government/ the State Budget showed a -deficit, while theGerman manufacturers were in receipt of enhanced profits,aome of which they were converting Into foreign creditsc.Herr* Rathhau/was of opinion that these credits were net more. than enough to finance German industry, but while doubts mightbe felt on this point,&apos; it was quite clear that it would be most difficult for the German Government to lay their handsupon the actual money.     The real fact was that the GermanGovernment was a very weak Government, in fear of Bolshevismon the one hand and a revival, of Prussianisitf on the other.&apos;Any moratorium granted to Germany should be uponconditions,such as the cessation of all subsidies, the balancing of theState. Budget, the&apos; stoppage of note printing, the Calculationin gold of customs duties   the re-constitution on more indepen-dent lines of the Reichsbnnk^ gnd the raising of the Internal
prise. of- Coal in Germany.  .The experts were ^unanimously of       opinion that if theAllies wore to insist on Germany making oonsiderablpheavier payments than she could at present afford tomake, : she       would before the whiter collapse into ahopeless state of chaos.     Mv Loucheur had admitted that france did not desire the coliapse of Germany,      when asked whether, in the event of default tho $mm-Sh Govern-iment would occupy the Ruhr he had,  speaking for himself,deprecated such occupation, hut this might not,  of. course.,be the view of the French Government, which might be .forced by French public opinion into violent action.-- It was cuite clear that M. 3rian&apos;d would suggestthat Great Britain should lend Germany the money toenable her to satisfy.the coming instalments.&apos;     This,in effect, would be equivalent to Groat Britain paying    :. Germany&apos;s reparation, whioh she Was not &quot; in a positionto do, but even if she could find the money on this occasion,  she would undoubtedly be pressed to take.the    .same course, in the case of future instalments. . . M.Briandwould also no doubt.press Great Britain to give:up some part, of the 38 million pounds ,which she had received,under the August Agreement.      This, money represented&apos;, a-.contribution towards the - cost. of the British Army of . \Occupation, and-it.:.would be ,most objectionable to hand -:rany part of it over&apos; to France,  as by so doing.undoubtedly a deficit would be Created in next year&apos;s Budget.      ItWould be possible to say, to France that, if she would &apos;agree to the&apos;moratorium,,. Great Britain&quot; would be prepared,to waive her claim to any part of the excess valuesunder the:Ratrsnau-Loucheur- Agreement.. -&quot; . :;      . &apos; &quot;&apos;&quot; &apos; -       , Some; ;
Some discuss to ft then took place; as to -thePossibility of marketing a portion of the &quot;A&quot; Bonds,it being represented that even if these Bonds weresold at a very substantial  discount-, they !7ould stillfetch cash which would,be very acceptable to theFrench Government&apos;.      On the other hand it was pointedout that these Bonds might bo of groat value in thefuture,, and that it would be mistaken policy to part with them, for a&apos; more or less nominal figure at thepresent moment...The suggestion was then made that thedifficulties of the French Government were largelyattributable to the fact that France had not adopted a proper financial policy.      She was still maintaining a very expensive army, fleet., and air service, and wasengaging in costly adventures in the Near East,,      Solong as she refused to economise.,  it would be mistakenpolicy for Great Britain to deal- .tenderly with heron the reparation question..Attention was also&apos;drawn to the instabilityof M., Briand&apos;s position,   and it was pointed out thatif he returned, from England empty handed,&apos; he wouldprobably fall; particularly in view of the strong opposition which had. been raised&apos;, to his Angora policy,The view was e xpres sed that if M.  Poincare- were toreturn to power, it- might be..possible to come to some more satisfactory settlement with him than with McBriand*mi mil 11 iii i  . i a/&quot;- 5 -
A discusrsion next took place on the question of anglo-NAmeTrio-arL-dj^debt^ftnesa...and the view was expressed that the moment was not yet ripe for making any definite proposals on the subject to the AmericanGovernment.    It was pointed out  that if GreatBritain tJnce--started paying interest on the debtshe would have to continue to pay,  and that theeffect of such payment would be to enable theAmerican Government to reduce taxation and so place the American manufacture in a favour able position -asregards his British competitor      It was pointed outthat Great Britain wa3 at present materially assisting the American Government at the Washington Conferencearid by the Irish settlement and that it would be amistaken policy to initiate any payment of Interestexcept under the greatest pressureaA suggestion was made that Prance might be willing to disarm if she could. be given a defensivealliance w?,th Great Britain, but it was pointed out thatthe French Government were opposed to such an alliance,and it was suggested that if MeBriand threatened toocc\ipy the Ruhr if Germany defaulted, that it mightbe.sufficient to threaten her with isolation and thetermination of the EntentecM.Briand might ask that the difficulty should be   considered at a Meeting of the Supreme.Council, but  :it was pointed out that France would be.in a minority orthe Council, in wishing to occupy the Ruhr.The suggestion was then made that in order, tohelp&apos;France, an effort should be made to persuadeBelgium tb postpone her priority in .favour of France,provided Great Britain made some similar contribution;/but it was
but it Was pointed out that ihe present attitudeof the Belgian Government on- the subject- was veryuncompromising.    &apos;-It was then urged that-, a national economic Conference should ho summoned forthwith to consider the whole European situation; and thatthis&apos;- suggestion would give *u Briand the time which.he much needed to make his arrangements^In connection with this, last suggestion,.reference was made to the&quot;enormous importance to -,-Great Britain of the economic reconstruction ofEurope&apos; mad especially of Eastern ,Europe,    It was clear that the rehabilitation of Russia could onlybe properly effected, by /Germany, and proposals hadbeen made tint the A 111.64 &apos;    should, facilitate, the task ofGermany in this respect, and that a. substantial propor-tion of the German profits, derived from a revivedRussia should be earmarked for reparation purposescHerr Stinnes and Herr. Rathensu were strongly in favour...of a scheme on these lines, and it was. proposed thatthe British &quot;&quot;In is tors&apos; should discuss the whole situation with- &apos;1..Briahd and M*Loxicheur-.-. It;..was,however,/pointed out that before any scheme of this-character could be brought into operation, the consentnnd: co-operation of the Soviet Government would benecessary., - snd it would clearly .involve some foreign.,control of the Russian Railways and Cixstoms and themaking of definite&apos;guarantees in respect of theRussian debt,.&quot;    ,The Cabinet agreed:----&apos;--.&quot;&apos;     (i)      That in the conversations withM-s :B&apos;riand- and ILLoueheur the PrimeMinister should be perfectly free,1   . to examine all aspects&apos;of:proposals&apos;for dealing&apos;with the problem ofGerman renarations and inter-alia&apos;]/a scheme

He dissented,,however,  from any decision &quot;hcing taken at this stage $arid,:in - the absence of several colleagues, to accord&quot;diplomatic recognition to the Soviet governments the Secretary of State for India also wishedit to be recorded that&apos; in his view any scheme c-on-&apos; corning Russia must depend on the cessation of&apos; the organised activities&apos;conducted under the auspices of the Russian Government against theBritish Empire -.activities against which he hada 1 r e a d y pr o t e s t e d 3The    Secretary of State forForeign Affairswhohad left the Room before the., latter part of the above.discussidhl had taken place and who had received nointimation that the question would be raised, asksto have his view recorded that- the .Foreign office should be Consulted before, a decision on any of theabove subjects is taken and more especially to reserve his opinion as to diplomatic recogmition   8. of the Soviet Government - a matter vitally affecting- the -foreign ^policy, of tho Empire and . our. relations -w I th&apos; our. Al lies.
(3)    The Cabinet were informed that Daii Eireann. would .:probably adjourn the discussion .on the Articles ofAgreement and that it was possible, that a definite decision might be postponed for some days.  .The. Cabinet agreed:-(1) That it would be necessary for parliament to remain in Sessionuntil next week.(ii) That the Chief Secretary for ireland should consult with his advisers as to the steps to betaken for holding another electionfor the Parliament of southern ireland, in the event of the rejection by&apos;Da i1 Eireann of theArticles of Agreement.(4)    The Cabinet had under consideration the following documents relative to the present financial -positionOf the Unemployment Grants CommitteeExtract (Minute 4) -from C .0. 45th Conclusions.CP. 3559. . /-Memo, by Minister of Health CP, 3549.The Cabinet were informed that under the schetoe for assisting local authorities to find work for the unemployed,which was administered by Lord St. Davids9 Committee,the contribution to be made by the Treasury in the formof interest and sinking fund was to be limited to a capital sum Of  10,000*000, and that Lord St. Davids&apos;Committee should not sanction schemes above that amountunless a further arrangement Was made.     After indicating that up to the 13th December the Committee had approved660 schemes Of a total capital value of  7,500,000, andaffording employment estimated to occupy 880,000 men for one month, the Cabinet were informed that the Committeehad before them some 600 further scheme calling for afurther capital expenditure of  7,000,000,- and that thiswould exceed by  4.500,000 the provisional limit of 10,000,000.     A rough estimate indicated that the amountof the Treasury commitments in respect of schemes up to :the  10,000,000 limit would be about  4.00*000 a year,and that the f^esh schemes now In question would increase
this  400,000 to  600,000 a year.     The Chancellorof the Exchequer had intimated his inability to findthis extra  200,000 a year.-   The position was serious in as much as localauthorities had been pressed to out up schemes to LordStg Davids&apos; Committee and it would be deplorable ifthe Committee had. now to inform the authorities thatthe available money was exhausted.It was tirged on the one hand that Lord St, Davids&apos;Committee was doing most useful work and. finding a maximum amount of employment at an economical rate, that any holding up of the schemes would be regarded by the local avithoritiesas an attempt by the State to escape from bearing its fair share of the unemployment burden and would also be criticicedin as much as no notice of the restriction had been published.    If it was necessary to impose any limit itwas suggested that all schemes submitted to Lord St, Davids&apos;Committee before the 1st of February next should betreated as eligible for grant.On the other hand the serious financial positionof the country was emphasised and also the great difficultyof balancing next year&apos;s Budget even on the assumptionthat the  175,000,000 would be cut from the estimates   -on the recommendations of the Geddes Committee,    reference was made to the very generous provision already made bythe Government for unemployment which amounted in theaggregate to a far greater contribution than any othercivilised country had ever made.      It was also pointedout that this was only one of several claims which were being pressed for the relief of unemployment, and that before
any more money waa provided it would be much better to wait and see how the existing schemes developed.There could be no more certain way of increasing unemployment than to add fresh burdens to the Exchequer.The C cabinet agre ed :-(l) That the 600 further schemes at presentbefore the Lord Sta Davids&apos; Committee. shouldbe most carefully examined with aview to the elimination of all proposalswhich were not of a strictly utilitarianCharacter and in particular that schemes,such as those for the canstruction-ofrecreation grounds should be rejected.(2) That the revised list of schemes whencompleted should be submitted for furtherconsideration to a Committee composed ofthe -Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer? the Secretary of State for War*the Minister of Healthy the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Minister ofLabour.

&quot;the- Tl^a^y,dat ed 18th Pecembe-r, (Annexe I) omohasisedthe need for an iiaE6*diato reply to Lord Reading asthe Prince of &quot;--aled was due to&apos; arrive in Calcutta onthe  4-th instant^ and the Yiooroy who was to receive adeputation, head     by. Malaviya on the 21st instant,was to leave Calcutta on the 22nd-instant.Ho explained the nature of the volunteer movementIn India,     It consisted cf the drilling of bodies armed with -&quot;lathis&quot; which were used as a substitute for riflesfor drill purposes.    The volunteers had appeared inBangalore, Delhi and Cawpore ,     Their number was smallhut he had impressed upon the Viceroy that the drillingwas an intolerable, insult to Government.   Up to now themovement had not become dangerous and It was not illegalbut it was a dangerous movement and the Viceroy proposed .to pass legislation at the next session making Itillegal.     The voltnitecrs roforretf to in Lord Beading&quot;stelQgram were of a different nature,     They were- an association of young men not of a military stamp organised to take part in the non-co-operation movement and torender social service.. The movement had itscommendable si do, for one of Its objects was to break Sownthe barriers of caste and  to    give assistance to theuntouchables. Those volunteers in the present situatio:&apos;have become dangerous.    They are now used by the non-co-operators to organise &quot;bar hospitals&quot;and for purposes of
Intimidation.     The Viceroy&apos;s policy of florae hadimmediately been successfule     The non-co-operatorsbecame alarmed and at once made a movement for an accommodation with Government,     He read a draft ofhis proposed reply to the Viceroy as follows&quot;Private and personal.     Your private and personal telegram of the 18th Decemberreceived last night at a time when theGovernment is deeply preoccupied withan International Conference,     They aredesirous of sending you as helpful an answer as they possibly can. but timedoes not permit either of detailed examination of all the bearings of your proposals or of elucidation of certain aspects which would appear to require futher consideration.At    H.M.&apos; s Government would of courseoffer no objection to your agreeing toreceive in Conference anybody whom you would desire to receive-.     A discussion would certainly have the obvious advantages of leading to the formulation of the demands made by the different sections of indian opinion,, and in the discussion the sincerity of your&apos;Government, and what it had already done and is doing could be forciblydemonstrated.     Therefore if you are askedto agree to a conference, HoM. &apos;&apos;s Governmentvirould concur in your agreeing, but theywould make two observations,(1) You will of course not losesight of your duty to the Members ofyour legislature which must be fulfilledin dealing with those who have failed tosecure or refused to attempt to secure,this although it appears to be obviousthat your legislature would welcome such a conference,(2) I must not leave you in any doubt that it would be almost, if not entirely, impossible to get Parliamentafter one short year&apos;s trial, to extend the Government of India Act, 1919. andI notice that,  as at present advised,,you see no necessity or cause for suchan e xtensicn.     What is required isthat within the four wails of thestatute, Indians should take advantageof their new opportunities as theywould appear to have done in this lastyear, so that they can come in due course to Parliament, and base their claims, not on demands which were considered so recently, but on actual work done and actual conventions of political life established, and it may well bethat within the scope of the present act these opportunities could befurther extended,
1 o6 6LORD curzon stated the Viceroy&apos;s telegram raised the most forrnid.able and far reaching questions of policy,and the draft reply did not appear to him to meet&apos;thesituation.     The Viceroy appeared to be ready to(3)B, In assenting to a Conference you cannot mean, I imagine, to make it conditional/.. upon a welcome to the Prince of Wales.   any idea of such a bargain would, it seems to usbe most improper and certain to have unfortunate-nate consequences in the future.     You can,of course, make it quite clear that a conference would be impossible if the Congress leaders and those who follow their lead were breaking the law and necessitating prosecutions or evenactively indulging in hostile demonstrationsand that a conference would only be possiblein an atmostphere of peace.    Any idea of using the Prince as the consideration for a bargainshould, be eschewed and if necessary repudiated,C. I come now to the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of the proclamation againstvolunteers.      I find it difficult to agreeto the release of prisoners except on an understanding that they, will, on release,abstain from those activities which render them liable to prosecution, and with a clearlyexpressed determination that they will be prosecuted again if there is any repetition of the offences for which they are nowImprsioned, but bargains with individualprisoners are useless unless supplemented by undertakings from those who are in aposition to direct their actions.    Further,it seems to iue impossible to say that becauseyou have assented to come into conference,institutions &apos;..;hich you regarded/as illegalyesterday you now regard as legal, whichwould be the result of the -withdrawal of the proclamations.      The proclamations would onlybe withdrawn if it v;ere shewn that the volun-teer associations had ceased to be dangerous to the public order, or if their members had ceased to commit breaches of the law.    Thatis to say, the proclamations could only bewithdrawal on an undertaking that militarydrilling and interference with public order and with the liberty of the public or of individuals would cease to be practised.I am sure I need not remind you to considerthe position of local Governments and protect their prestige in whatever action you may decide on,Subject to these observations, HisMajesty&apos;s Govern erst concur in your proposal.
 compromise the whole Indian policy of the Government and to endanger British rule in India in order to purchase the ephemeral advantage of a good reception for the Prines? of Sales? In Calcutta. In view of the course of events in India during the past three months, he thought that Lord Reading&apos;s action in arresting large numbers of Indians, Including prominent men, leaders of society and members of council at the present time when tho Prince was in India, to be most unfortunate. The idea of making a bargain with Malaviya&apos;s deputation, agreeing that the Government of India should withdraw the Proclamation against the volunteers and hold a conference with all the disloyal elements in India, if non-operators would consent to cancel the "hartal" arranged for Calcutta should never be agreed to. It must be clearly understood that the Conference suggested in January at Delhi was not an ordinary conference. It is based upon the analogy of the Irish Conference, and as pointed out by Lord Reading, it is certain that it inevitably means the discussion of Swaraj and the repeal of the Government of India Act of 1919. He strongly opposed the idea of any such Conference being sanctioned. There could be no concessions on the question "Swaraj" and if the conference had no results the consequences would be deplorable. As it had been known for some time that a "hartal" in Calcutta was probable, suitable measures should have been taken to meet the situation, and the Viceroy should have referred the question to His Majesty&apos;s Government at an earlier date. Lord Ourzon added that he had discussed the question with the

  
Lord-Chancellor, who had informed him thatPjrima facie ho was opposed to the idea of thes ugge s te d C onf er enc e .MR. CHURCHILL entirely agreed with Lord Curzon^remarks.   He was strongly opposed to consent being given to a Conference at twenty four hours&apos; notice. If aConference was agreed to, it would mean   an immediatedemand for the scrapping of the Mcntagu-Chelmsfordreforms sad the demand for the substitution of some form of self-government.     -The idea of bargaining fora good reception for the Prince of V/ales in Calcuttawas most ignominous.    It would be far better to cancel the visit of the Prince cf Wales to Calcutta, than to compromise the Government&apos;s policy in India in orderthat he might have a good reception there.   Hesuggested that the &quot;Viceroy should be informed that nodeparture in policy should be made by him in order tosecure a good reception for the Prince in Calcutta andthat the question of whether the proposed conference should be held or not would be considered by his majesty&apos;s Government in the ensuing week,MR. MOHTAGU dissented from the views expressed byLord Curzon and Mr. churchill.     He had always been ofopinion that a conference with the disloyal parties would ultimately be necessary.      If this view was correct, It would be unfortunate to refuse a conference to Malaviya&apos;s deputation, only to be forced into, aconference at a later date, after disturbances and blood-shed.     He proposed to make it clear to the Viceroy that parliament would not now consent to any radicalamendment of the Government- of India   Aot of 1919, but
&quot;he did not see -why extensions might not he made withinthe limits-of the existing law.     It was difficult inIndia for tho Government to get in touch with publicopinion and he believed a Conference would be the best means by ?;hioh the Viceroy could explain the point ofvie&quot;* of the Government to tho people generally.     TheYicercy would thus be afforded an opportunity of informing the agitators that there was no chance ofany immediate step being taken towards the establishmentof &quot;awaraj&quot;.     He pronosod that iho viceroy should be told(1)    that the holding of Ja. Conference should in no way be m&amp;fie conditional upon a favourable reception being given to the Prince of Walesat Calcutta.(B)    that the proclamation against the VolunteersshouXd stand,   and /\3)    that His Eajesty&apos;s Government will notat pre&amp;ent sanction any ohange In the constitutionof India.If&quot;a Conference wore held in January, it would mean a-poriod of three or four-tooonths before the resultinginstructions of His ,Majesty&apos;s Government could be for-warded to India, and during this period tho forces of disorder in India might abate.MB. $ISHSH, on the whole, agreed with Mr.Montagu&apos;s suggested reply, but considered that itshould be strengthened in certain respects.     he considered that if the Viceroy wont into a conference it should be made perfectly clear that no extension ofthe Government of India Act of 1919 could be approved I
His Majesty&apos;s Government at present, and that there should be no bargaining over the reception to the Price of Wales. He was opposed to the release of prisoners unless a satisfactory and collective guarantee for their future good conduct was given to the Indian Government. He was of opinion that the proclamation against the volunteers should not be cancelled. These conditions would be thought be safeguards against the evils to which Lord Curzon had drawn attention. The extremist party in India was powerful a definite political programme. He thought it would be advantageous to bring them now into contact with the Government of India. One of the greatest difficulties of the Government of India was the paucity of the means at its disposal for making its position known to the people.

MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he was much disturbed by the Viceroy&apos;s telegram. The Viceroy had placed the Government in an exceedingly difficult position in laying before them proposals of a far reaching character, to which he was apparently already half committed, and in demanding a reply with twenty-four hours. He feared that the Government of India were losing control over the situation and were losing confidence in themselves.

He was opposed to a decision being given in a hurry as to the conference, and to the conference being in any way connected with the Price of Wales&apos; visit.

 
He was inclined to reply to the Viceroy that if he-was doubtful of the success of the Prince1 a   visit the Prince should net go to Calcutta.     That would be equivalent to -a censure of the people of Calcuttawhich &quot;they had nor 1 tea.Eis Majesty7 s Government should not consent tothe Conference until they had been informed of theresults of tho proceedings; In Ccunoil on the 20thDecember and of the meeting with the deputation on the 1st.It was desirable that the Viceroy should be askedfullyto inform His Majesty&quot; s Government/of the scope and nature of the Conference proposed by the deputation and who was to be present at it.The general sense of tho meeting appeared tobe that, Lord Heading should, be instructed that when he received the deputation on the 21st December, he should inform them that His Majesty&apos;s Government hadnot been consulted with regard to tho proposal tohold a Conference in January, and that ho was thereforeunable to comply with their request.     He shouldrequest tho deputation to submit their viows as tothe scope and membership of tho proposed Conference,and that ho should forward their proposals to- HisMajesty&apos;s Government for their consideration.The Viceroy should also inform tho Deputation, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not entertain any suggestion for the radical amendment of the Government cf india act of 1919, and that no bargain should be made with
regard to the Prince- of&quot;Walesvisit to Calcutta.CONCLUSION.ESSm WW- i mi i mum11 in ******That MT* Chamberlain and Mr^ Montagushould prepare a telegram for despatch to the Viceroy &quot;based upon the views expressed by the majority     cf the-Members of the Committee? .X*MR. MONTAGU desired that his dissent from theopinion of the majority of the Committee be recorded.*X*    The Telegram is printed as Annexe IIto these Minutes*2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W*,20th December, 1921.
From Viceroy, IStli December 1921.1Very secret and very urgent. Situation now developing very fast. Time is very short as His Royal Highness&apos; the Prince of Wales arrives on&apos; 24th. I leave on the22nd, and if anything is to be arranged, it must be by the 22nd at latest. Brieflystated position is : (I) Immediate objective is to prevent trouble or demonstration by abstention andhartals when Prince arrives. I attribute the greatest importance to visit herebecause -(a) An unpleasant reception in Calcutta would affect the public mind in England,.and even here, far more than Allahabad.(b) It would, I fear, provoke racial bitterness and collisions between europeans and, with them, Anglo-Indians, on the one hand, and the Indian population on the other.   Feeling runs high.(c) The proclamation of the volunteers here and in some ether provinces, and the consequent demonstrations and arrests, have caused state of tension which,although at present non-violent, is nevertheless causing great excitementthroughout the country, and particularly is bent on (&apos;? getting omitted)many respectable Indians to protest against Governments action andtendency to associate prosecution -with non-co-operation.Moreover, the imprisonment of men, or their sons, well known in the city, and of otherwise unimpeachable reputation, causes emotion, particularly amongst the&apos;thoughtful in Bengal, and for the moment calmness of judgment of government action is absent. Moreover, the many stories of excess of authority or undueinterference and high-handed action, have their effect. Doubtless, as generallyhappens, some individual regrettable acts may have been committed under very-difficult circumstances, but wild exaggerations are circulated. Lord Ronaldskay is&quot;,doing everything possible to prevent excesses by the authorities, and to correct abuseswhere they exist.(2) This immediate objective can only be reached, if at all, by my immediate-promise to invite members of the different political sections, including, oi: course^non-co-operators and moderates, to attend a Conference at Delhi, probably inJanuary. Priina -facie there can be no objection ; indeed, 1 would welcome discussion which, even if it result in nothing practical, will not make the position worse, andmay have good effect. The policy of merely enforcing the law is, of course, negative,and although essential for the purpose of establishing and maintaining authority, is-not in itself a remedy.   It only prepares the ground for it.I have all along been anxious to meet the agitators and to strive to understandtheir practical propositions, which have never yet been set forth, save as regards the punjab and the Khilafat. What is meant by Swaraj, when used by the variousleaders, has never yet been defined. Nevertheless, there is generally throughout India, even though in many respects vague and undefined, a desire for some form of responsible Government. My impression is that the phenomenon now-witnessed of men of moderate views protesting against the present Government policy^,for which they called so recently, is largely due to undefined aspirations for Swaraj,,which unite the different parties of Indians in sympathy in this respect,I give you this appreciation of the situation because I want you to understandclearly what will, or may be, the effect of our agreeing to enter into a Conference..The control of the situation is of course with you at home. Nothing can be effected,,obviously, without.Cabinets assent and Parliaments approval of any proposal.We are bound by the period mentioned in the Act of Parliament. Doubtless, asI have understood your speeches and as is obvious, Parliament if it chose mightconsent to an earlier period of revision. I am not myself at this moment prepared to-go further than say that I can conceive proposals for amendment of the present Actwith the object of improving the constitutional machinery and advancing on the road to the ultimate goal of Dominion status. But I am not prepared to advise this stepat present, or even, so far as I can gather, in the immediate future. But yet I do-see that the pace is quickening; my own view at the moment is that dominion status Will have to come by successive progressive stages.Proposals atpresent under discussion, and which must either succeed or fail withinthe next two or three days, have been made by Malaviya, but require at present the:authority of Gandhi before they can be made effective.   He asks me to receive &amp;
deputation on the 21st for the purpose of their preferring a request to me for aconference. Any proposal for. conference inevitably means a proposal to discussSwaraj, and here lies my real difficulty. I have told Malaviya that 1 will not discussthe conference unless the boycott is called off regarding the Prince of Wales&apos; visit,here and elsewhere, and that, if Gandhi and his associates make a large gesture inthis direction in a broad and generous spirit, I would respond in the same way. This,would mean the withdrawal of the Proclamation against Volunteers, and the releaseof as many of those persons, leaders and others, Avho have been imprisoned fordisloyalty to this Proclamation, or for other offences during the period since the proclamation oil Volunteer Associations, and this would apply not only to Bengalbut to all Local Governments. Lord Eonaldshay is in complete agreement.He has to meet his Legislative Council to-morrow, when a motion will be uioved foradjournment of the House. He will, however, make a statement indicating that, ifthe non co-operators are prepared to stop the boycott and the unlawful acts for thepurpose of bringing it about, his Government will be. prepared to take the course of withdrawing the Proclamation against Volunteers, and generally of meeting the new situation in the same spirit, lie will also announce on my authority that 1 have-communicated to Malaviya that I shall be prepared to receive his deputationon 21st December. &apos; You will appreciate that there is so little time thatI must act to this extent, which is, I believe, in accordance with your views.Lord Ronaldshay was with me this evening at an interview with Malaviya.I again made clear, at this interview, what 1 had stated to Malaviya at an earlier discussion, namely, that it must be distinctly understood that. I muststate to the Deputation that, in arranging a Conference, I am not committingmyself, or my Government, or His Majesty&apos;s Government, to accepting any of theviews that may be presented, and that it may be that no results will follow from theConference. 1 wished him clearly to understand this at the outset, as I must guard against possible suggestions in the future, should the Conference prove abortive, thatthe Non-Co-operators or others had been misled by my attitude. I pointed out to him that it was not in my power, and indeed that I would be acting contrary to my duty,if I undertook to make specific recommendations to Bis Majesty&apos;s Government, inasmuch as I should then have compromised them. 1 emphasised that the decision on allthese questions must rest with His Majesty&apos;^ Government and the: Imperial Parliament,and that 1. could not, and would, not, take any step without their knowledge and assentwhich would prejudice the position. Moreover, I intimated to him that, at present,I did not see my way to make any recommendations for a change, and that he oughtib know that this was my view.He begged that I should nevertheless listen to the views presented, whichprobably would not all agree, and come to my own conclusion, and not shut my minddefinitely to any representations that might be made. I answered that I would&apos; beprepared to listen and discuss, and would then consider all the arguments placed before me, and have to report to His Majesty&apos;s Government according to theconclusions I formed as the result of all my consideration. But I insisted that mycalling of the Conference must not be taken to commit us to any course save to hear the arguments and representations, lie agreed, and admitted that this was theconstitutional course, and they could ask no more than that 1 should consider theirarguments sympathetically. I observed that this phrase had its danger, as it mightbe taken to imply my assent to some of suggestions made, but that, of course,.at sucha conference, I should desire, if possible, if I could conscientiously do it, to arrive atsome better condition of affairs.The announcement has appeared in the newspapers that Malaviya has been to seems, and he has communicated to the Press that his object is to ask me to receive adeputation requesting a conference.I have called a meeting of my Council, which will meet here on the 20th, in order-that 1 may carry them with me in my action. I have no doubt they will agree. TheIndian members particularly are pressing me very strongly to stop the prosecutions.and to call the conference.I am also sending telegrams to the Local Governors informing them that I shall receive the deputation and of the suggested course to be taken. I am not sure thatall will approve the release and withdrawal of proclamation on the conditionssuggested, but I am quite clear that some such step is inevitable, and particularlyhere in Bengal. Indeed, it would be absurd of Governments to continue to enforce a law which rouses such strong opposition when the immediate\object of the proclamation*an be attained by agreement making for peace.
Telegram just received from Jamnadas Dwarkadas, who had been to Ahmedabadto see Gandhi, that Gandhi agrees to attend Conference and makes no conditions. Iam still awaiting GandhTs answer to Malaviya respecting the Prince&apos;s visit, and as you will understand the present proposals centre upon the better conditions for the prince&apos;s visit.I am most anxious to receive His Majesty&apos;s Governments approval to this course.; So far, I am committed only to receiving the deputation on the 21st, which will be announced by Lord Ronaldshay to-morrow afternoon in his Council. But nothing--can happen and no arrangement can be made unless I agree to call a conference in answer to the deputation on the 21st.     You will observe how short the time is.and how much will be left to be done between that date and the 24th, when the prince arrives ; and I beg, therefore, that you will most urgently send rue an answer at- once, especially as I have many other arrangements to make in connection with thismatter.If you have difficulty in getting a Cabinet decision, I hope you will get that ofthe Prime Minister and others whom you think of greatest importance in Indianaffairs. Please remember that the Irish situation has given tremendous impetus tothe movement, here for conference.   All parties of Indians seem to agree in desire for-conference vas way out of present difficulty. I fear that, if I refused it, the effectwoiild be to break down the whole Reform Scheme, for I think the various councils and the Legislative Assembly would undoubtedly pass resolutions to this effect.Please also bear in mind the position of my Indian colleagues in the Council.   I-cannot, myself, see any serious objection to the course I am proposing, provided we-obtain the change of attitude regarding the Prince of wales visit, which will quite-alter the atmosphere and relieve the tension, and is an essential condition.Throughout, I have borne well in mind the position of the British here, as well as the indians.Of course you may use any parts of this telegram you choose, but do not makeany public announcement till you hear from me.
From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 20th December 1921.Clear the line.Private and personal. Most urgent. Your private and personal telegram of IStbDecember, received last night at a time when the Government is deeply pre-occupied with an International Conference. I am sure that you will realise the great difficultyin which the Cabinet is placed when it is consulted on so grave a question and requested to give an answer in 21 hours. We have no opportunity of seeking the further information or explanations from you which we should desire before giving oar decision.In this ease your telegram leaves us in some doubt how far you have already committed yourself by your conversations with Malaviya or others; but we assumesince you ask our opinion that at this stage, you are still free to assent or disseutfrom the summoning of the conference as may seem best to you after to-morrow&apos;sdeputation. On this assumption we proceed to state how the proposal  or a conferencestrikes us.(1) We fear that it-would be difficult to reconcile the reception in conference ofthose who have failed to secure, or refused to secure, election to the Legislature, withthe proper respect owing to the members of your Legislature. I say this although itappears that your Legislature would welcome such a conference.(2) More important still, we cannot see how it is possible to prevent such aconference from developing into a simple demand for swaraj, and for scrapping ascheme of Government approved by Parliament only two years ago and in operation for less than one year. My colleagues felt that mere formulation of such a demand bya conference summoned by you would be an act of grave moment, and would greatlyweaken your power of resistance and strengthen tli8 dissatisfied and disaffectedelements. If the conference were of a kind likely to produce a settlement satisfactory to you and to us, much might be said for it, but failure to secure agreement or a formal demand for impossible terms would leave us in a worse position than now.The Cabinet held that a conference which fails is infinitely worse than no conferenceat all.I must not leave you in any doubt that it would be impossible to recommend toParliament, after one short year&apos;s trial, to extend the Government of India Act, 1919,and I notice that, as at. present advised, you see no necessity or cause for such anextension. What is required is that within the four walls of the statute, Indiansshould take advantage of their new opportunities as they would appear to have donein this last year, so that they can come in due course to Parliament, and base their claims, not on demands which were considered so recently, but on actual work done and actual conventions of political life established, and it may well be that within thescope of the present Act these opportunities could be further extended.In discussing proposal for a conference you cannot mean, I imagine, to make itconditional upon a welcome to the Prince of Wales. Any idea of such a bargainwould, it seems to us, be most improper and certain to have unfortunate consequencesin the future. You can, of course, make it quite clear that a conference would beimpossible if the Congress leaders and those who follow their lead were breaking thelaw and necessitating prosecutions or even actively indulging in hostile demonstrations,and that a conference would only be possible in an atmosphere of peace. Even theappearance of using the Prince as the consideration for a bargain must be avoided.1 come now to the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of the proclamationsagainst volunteers. I find it difficult to agree to the release of prisoners except on an understanding that they will, on release, abstain from those activities which render them liable to prosecution, and with a clearly expressed determination that they willbe prosecuted again if there is any repetition of the offeuces for which they are nowimprisoned, but bargains with individual prisoners are useless unless supplemented by undertakings from those who are in a position to direct their actions. iVurther, itseems to me impossible to say that because you have assented to come into aconference, institutions which you regarded as illegal yesterday you now regard aslegal, which would be the result of the withdrawal of the proclamations. the proclamations could only be withdrawn if it were shown that the volunteerassociations had ceased to be dangerous to the public order, or it their members had ceased to commit breaches of the law. That is to say, the proclamations could onlybe Avithdrawn on an undertaking that military drilling and interference with public order and with the liberty of the public or of individuals would cease to be practised.I am sure I need not remind you to consider the position of Local Governments andprotect their prestige in&quot; whatever action you may decide on.
You will see that the objections to a conference and its possible results enter-tained by the Government made it impossible for as to sanction your announcing aconference at the deputation to-morrow, even though such an announcement mighthave insured a proper reception of the Prince of Wales at Calcutta. The cabinet felt that these apprehensions were such as to outweigh the risks of hartals, &amp;c, oreven if you thought necessary the cancellation of the Prince&apos;s visit to that city.In any case we shall be glad to learn from you after you have heard the depu-tation what is the exact scope and character of the conference that is proposed, andif, after considering our views, you- still think such a conference desirable, we shallmost carefully consider the arguments by which you and your Government supportthat proposal.

(1)    THE SECRETARY 01? STATS FOR THE COLOUILS infornedthe Conference that since his memorandum (C.p.5515)was written he had had the opportunity of discussing-&quot;the situation with the Secretaries of State for War.India and Air.    They had no objection to the proposals put forward in the meiucrrandum: unless, therefore,the Cabinet disagreed with the proposals, he suggep+^dthat they should table  note of the agreement reached between the three Departments,MR. FISHER pointed out that .it was desirablethat an attempt should be made to secure acceptance -fthe Palestine mandate by the league of Nations at t^einext meeting.    The   High Commissioner was much embarr-assed by the absence of that approval.    Two obstacleswere in the way:    the negotiations with America onthe subject were not yet complete, and Italy had notyet been brought into agreement.It was pointed out that it was not likely that italy would give her consent until after the meeting with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at paris on January 9th.    If that meeting resulted in  paccommodation with Italy it was possible that she would agree to the mandate.The Conference:-took  note and approved of the proposalfor the gaxrisoning of pa.lestine,made by the secretary of State for the Colonies, andconcurred   in by the Secretaries of Statefor V/ar, India and. Air.(2)    TEE SECRETARY OE STATE EOR THE COLONIESexplained that the question raised in CP ..-3565was whether consent should, be given to a suggestionthat Eeisal should get into communication withHaji Bey and ascertain from him privately whatMustapha Kema!&apos;s intentions were in re.ge.rd to Iraq.
\        ll ,11The Conference- agreed:-That there was no objection to Feisalcommunieating with Maji Bey, provided itwas clearly understood that it was notwith the&apos; object of entering into negotia- .t-ions with Kemal, but of discovering his attitude to Iraq,(3)    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGK affairs explained that he wished to have the instructions ofthe Cabinet on this matter before proceeding to paris, where he had arranged to mee$ the foreign ministers of Prance and Italy on January 9th.   Hehad informed M6 Briand that he would send him inadvance the outlines of the proposals that he would lay before the Conference.   His proposals are set forth in CP.3671.   He explained that the situation had improved of late in two respects.   The relations ofthe Allies with one another were better, as were therelations between the Allies and the Angora Government.M. Briand had been severely criticised in France formalcing the Franklin-Bouillon treaty which it was generally recognised was both unfriendly to England-and was, in effect, st betrayal of the Armenians.   MiBriand had assured him that he believed that theAllies could now come to an agreement with Kema.l0The Greeks had placed themselves entirely in our hands *It had become clear that the only terms of peaceacceptable to the Turks would, be the total withdrawalof the Greeks from Asia Minor.    It was, however,necessary to secure the safety of the Greek population and Greek interests in&apos;, that region.    The alternative proposals set forr,h in column - 4 of C *P. 3571 were explained.   Alternative forma of Government were&apos;proposed.   Either that set up in the Saar Basin wherethere is a governing commission appointed by theLeague/
League of Nations, the Chairman being appointed bythe League, or that set up in Lebanon where there isa Christian Governor   chosen by Turkey, with theconsent of the powers and immovable without thatconsent.     The Saar precedent was regarded as preferableas It brought in the League of Nations.      It was thoughtthat the League of Nations would readily accept theresponsibility that rould be thrown upon it underthe Saar arrangement, provided that a satisfactorypolice force was established and paid for by the Turks,and provided no serious financial responsibility wasthrown upon the League,It was suggested that if the Saar system wereadoptedj the appointment of an American Chairman to theCommission would be advantageous in order to associateAmerica with the arrangement made.As regards the areas, it was thought that theproposed arrangement that the area should includethe Sanjak of Smyrna and the Kaza of Aivali was onthe whole preferable and that It was inexpedient tomade any reference to the arrangement proposed under(c) in the document communicated to M, Briand whowould probably communicate Britainfs proposals tothe Turks.The Conference agreed(a) As regards area, the third alternativein (c) should be omitted.(b) That the form of Government to be preferred should be that established in the Saar Basin.(c) That the Greek forces should be withdrawnfrom Asia Minor, and that a localgendarmerie; the cost of which should beborne by Turkey should be establised for the maintenance of internal order,
(i) Western Thrace.

It was agreed that the question of Western Thrace should not be opened.

(ii) LORD CURZON explained his proposals for re-adjusting the Turkish frontier in Europe in order to allay the apprehensions of the Turks.

The Conference were reminded that the attitude of the Turks as regards Eastern Thrace had been coloured by their anxiety as to the safety of Constantinople from a Greek attack. If England and France would give a guarantee to secure Constantinople from attack by Greece, small concessions as regards territory would probably satisfy the Turks.

Several suggestions were made for a new frontier, including one that the frontier should run north from Rodosto to the Maritsa River and should follow the line of that river so as to hand over the territory on its left bank including Adrianople to the Turks. The general view was that such an arrangement would be unfair to Greece which was to be asked to make considerable sacrifices as regards Smyrna. Another objection to the proposal was that it would at once raise the Bulgarian question.

The Conference agreed:-

That the Turco-Greek frontier should be amended so as to run approximately from Rodosto to Malatra Burnu as proposed by Lord Curzon.

(iv) Constantinople and Straits.

LORD CURZON explained his proposals for the return of Constantinople to the Turks, for the reduction of the demilitarised zone, and the international occupation of the Straits.

The Conference approved Lord Curzon&apos;s proposals subject to the observations of the General Staff on their military aspects.
Q (v) /rmcnia^ I&amp;m^tTUKffil^xpl&amp;lJied his proposalso     They-we re-brief ly that an enclave should be created inQ, the South near the sea where, under guarantees ofprotection all the remaining Armenians should becongregated.     He admitted that it was possiblethat this suggestion might not be practicable; but Itwas worth trying to do something for the Armeniansas to whose fate public opinion in England was much exercised.Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestions were approved.(vi) Minorities. It was pointed out that as provisions hadbeen made in the Treaty of Sevres for the protectionof the Mussulman minorities in Thrace, it xvasdesirable that similar provisions should beincluded in the new Treaty.(vii) Tripartite It was pointed out that the Powers nowAgreement.realised that the Angora Government v?ould neverconsent to a partition of Asia Minor into zones of special interestr      It was agreed that thisshould not be pressed,, but that we should give assurances tc Italy and Prance that, so far as weare concerned; we would adhere to the policy laid down in the Tripartite Agreement,(viil)Flnancial LORD CURZON explained his proposals as setClausescforth in Column 4 of C.P-357I.It was pointed out that it was very undesirable that we should incur the odium of imposing rigorousfinancial conditions on Turkeyi      If we make no proposals both Prance and Italy will insist upon conditions more severe than thosewhich/

It was pointed out on the otherhand/

Ke representedonly a small section of the Indian.JHaJtwanmedana-ommu.nl ty.The general feeling of the Conference wasthat the a-ppointment of an IndianMohammedan as a member of the british delegation at the Conference in Pariswould conciliate Indian opinion?   lord curzon undertook to give the matter further consideration.(6)   SR. FISHER informed the Conference that he had information that the Greek army was in a very badstate, desertions were numerous and the array would soon cease to exist as a fighting machine unlesssteps were taken to stop the process of deterioration.It was most desirable in the interests of the Alliesthat the Greek army Bhould be kept in being untilthe negotiations with the Turks were completed.It was stated that the question whether theTreasury should sanction the raising of a Greek loanin the City was now being considered.   The Treasurydesired to impose a condition that a certain pro-portion of any loan raised in Great Britain must be spent in England.   It was understood that the Greekshad agreed to this condition as to four-tenths ofthe loan raised.The Conference agreed;-(a) It is desirable that the Greek army should be kept in being pending thecompletion of the regotiations with turkey.(b) That the Government wished to offer no objection to the raising of loansin the City by the Greek and turkish governments.(?)

j     1   ? .301(1HBMPIrOYUBHa?        1.      With reference to Cabinet 93 (21) Conclusion 4,bahts committeeIKAT&amp;IAL tho Conference had before them a Memorandum by the&apos;0SMOM,Minister of Health (CP. 3574) upon the financial commitments of the Government in respect of schemes approved by the Unemployment Grants Committee for capital expenditure to be incurred by Local authorities for works put in hand by them in order to provideemploymente     It appeared that when tho scheme for assisting Looal Authorities was first set up, it was arranged at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee onUnemployment (c.U, 38, Conclusion 5 (3), thatschemes should not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of  10 millions without consultation between the Minister of Health, and the Chancellor of theExchequer,     Owing to an unexpected increase in theapplication from local        authorities the  10 millionlimit would shortly be reached, and at a meetingof the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment (CUo 45,Conclusion 1), on December 13th, It had been made clear that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was notprepared to sanction an increase of the limit which hadbeen provisionally laid down.     The matter had therefore been referred to the Cabinet, who had directed that the list of schemes before the Unemployment Grants !Committee should be revised, with a view to eliminatingthose which were not of a strictly utilitariannature, and that the list, as revised, should be remitted for consideration to the present conference.On a review of the applications already received bythe Unemployment Grants Committee, it appeared that only a very small proportion      were for works suchas  arks and Reoreation grounds, and that the remainderoould not be classed as luxury expenditure,
Th8 Conference were informed by the Secretaryof the UnempLoyment Grants Committee that up to dateschemes had been   sanctioned by his Committee to thevalue of  9\ millions;     that tho total cost ofschemes which had not yot been examined amountedto rather under  5  millions,  and that it might beanticipated that of those- roughly one-sixth would be rejected,  judging by tho exporionoe of the pastadministration of the scheme.     There would,  therefore,probably be an excess of some  4 millions over the 10 millions limit, if the administration of theCommittee proceeded without interruption.   Moreover,as schemes were oeming in at &amp;ho rate of some 50 a day,and would continue to do sc during tho next few days,i* was probable that schemes amounting to a further one million pounds would bo received before the end of theyear.     It would, therefore, bo unsafe to assume byJanuary 1st that the total number of applicationswould be less than  16 millions, making an excess of 6 millions, of which  5 millions might be expected, torank for grant, the remainder being rejected.The Committee wore informed that no indicationhad been given to Local Authorities that there was a financial limit to the capital cost of these schemes;that Looal Authorities had been pressed to send insohejBos, which wero now ocming in quickly, and thatthere would be a great outcry and strong- politicalfeeling if Local Authorities were now informed thatthe Government were unable to find any further money for financing schemes which thoy themselves had askedLocal Authorities to preparo.     It was made plain that
the omiasiorr&quot;td^irrform Local Authorities of thofinancial limit which had provisionally been fixedarose from tho fact that at the inception of thescheme it was thought that Local Authorities wouTdnot ho anxious to come forward.      The flood of applications received, had recently developed to;;h extent which had hot beon contemplated.The Chairman suggested that the Departmentsconcerned should tako no to for future guidance that,when a limit was provisionally fixod forany expenditure of this character, those concernedwith the administration of the scheme must takeoare in carrying out the scheme, that there wasno risk of that limit being exceeded, unless anduntil a definite decision to oxoeed it had been taken.It was explained to the Conference that the standardvof unemployment which the Minister of Lab Mir had laidflown for tho qualification of particular districts to have their schomec approved, was 6$ of workmenunemployed, with a minimum of 300 persons.    It wassuggested that tho limit thus fixed was much too low,and that having regard tc tho extraordinary effort which tho Government had been obliged to mako todeal with the emergency, the limit of severity shouldbe comparable with the distress which had induced the Government to set up so expensive a scheme.It was suggested that the limit should beraised to 10$, but the Minister of Labour was unableto agree tc this without consulting his advisers.It was pointed out that inasmuch as the circular from the Minister of Health to Local
Authorities had been issued in September, with an instruction that in order to qualify for grants, work on schemes must commence before January 1st, Local Authorities who had not submitted their schemes for approval before Christmas, could hardly complain the Government had broken faith, if sanction were refused.

After some discussion the Committee agreed:-

That the limit of the total capital cost of schemes presented by Local Authorities and approved by the Unemployment Grants Committee, should be increased from £10 millions to £13 millions, on the understanding that the Minister of Health, the Minister of Labour, and the Secretary for Scotland, in consultation with the Secretary of the Unemployment Grants Committee, should arrange to impose such tests, either in regard to the severity of unemployment in a particular district, the date by which schemes must be submitted, or the date before which work must commence - as would ensure that the total value of schemes approved would fall within the limit of £13 millions.

2. The Committee had under consideration a question which had been raised at a meeting of the Unemployment Committee (C.U. 44th Conclusions, Minute 5), relating to the proposal by the Minister of Health to permit Local Authorities to develop at the charge of the Exchequer account in connection with housing, building sites already purchased which were beyond what was actually required for building under the curtailed Lousing programme.

It was suggested that this should be done in localities in which there was serious unemployment which would otherwise be provided for, subject to 

  
there being a reasonable prospect of the land beingrepaired for building at an early date for the naturaldevelopment of the district.     Loeal authorities could at present undertake the work thezasolvos, withthe assistance of the 65$ grant of loan charges from the unemplx*ym*2ut Grants Committee for half theloan period. but were not preparsd to take therisk involved by this in the present oncer tainposition at the housing problem.It was stated by the Minister cf Health thatthe proposal would involve an addition te* theGovernment burden on housing account of &amp;hout 50,000 a year.In the opinion cf the Treasury this figure would&quot;be  80,000 for an indefinite number of years.   In theview of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,, housing expenditure was already proving a very heavy burden m thState, and to add so large a sum would be a serious matter at the reoment, when the Government were trying to cut flown expenditure in every direction.It was stated that the Ministry of Healthwere of opinion that Local Authorities should beable to sell sites thus developed before vary long,having regard to the fact that the pries of buiiaingwas coming Sevan, and that there was no reason why a, large part of the money should not be recovered.      1,000,000had been suggested as the total capital expenditure involved, but probably c-na-half of that sum would meet the needs of the case.     It wculd be in onerespect better that the money should be spent aspart cf the hcusing scheme, rather than that thedevelopment of building sites should be assisted
by the Unemployment Grants Committee.     Whoro a housing-scheme was involved, the officials of the Ministryof Health would examine the sites with tho groatestcare, and only sanction those which were reallysuitable for development^     This the unemployment grants Committee had not the staff to do.The Minister of Health suggested that the scheme could be worked In consultation with the unemployment grants Committee, and that the amount of money at thedisposal of that Committee could be pro tanto reducedto compensate for any additional expenditure under thehousing scheme0The Committee agreed;To approve the proposal that localAuthorities should be permitted todevelop, at the charge of theExchequer account in connection with housing, building sites already purchased^beyond what is actually required for building under the curtailed housing programme, provided that it oduld bearranged that any sums charged, to theExchequer should be taken pro tantoin reduction of the commitments      *&quot;&quot;of the Unemployment Grants Committee.DISABILITY    3*      The Conference had before them a rooommendationFENSIOHS &amp;POOH LAW        of the Home Affairs Committee to the Cabinet (H.A.C.RELIEF.100th Conclusions).&quot;   that the Minister of Health be authorised&quot;to inform Boards of Guardians that the&quot;Government propose to introduce legislation&quot;which they would endeavour to make retrospective,&quot;permitting Boards of Guardians, in assessing&apos;&quot;the claims of applicants for out-door relief,&quot;to ignore a part of disability pensionsp but&quot;that they could not guarantee that the exclusion&quot;of a higher amount than a flat rate of 10s. a&quot;week would bo authorised by such legislation.&quot;
The Minister &quot;-of Heal-tlv^e^EpXainad that it was   thepractice of raany Guardians to deduct the whole or partof a disability pension in   computing the income of an applicant for out-coor relief, and this, under the lawas it stood at present, they wore not entitled to do.As in London out-door relief was now a charge upon theCommon Poor Fund, it would shortly he necessary for himto inform tho Boards of Guardians that they were not en*fci-&apos;tied to naketbds deduction, and the question for decision was whether, follo-wlng the rooominandati ons ofthe Home Affairs Committee,he should inform Boards of guardians that they might continue to deduct disabilitypGnsion, and that, if legal difficulties arose, theGovernment would pass legislation to indemnify therm andto alter the law.The Secretary for Scotland stated that, apart fromthe merits of tho question, he must press that so far asScotland was   concerned, no directions to Guardiansshould he given In advance of legislation.     Considerabletrouble had already arisen In Scotland from thodeoision of the Government to authorise payment of out-door relief to able-bodied persons contrary to the strict letter of the law, and the action which had beentaken of curing the legal difficulty by subsequentlegislation had created a very difficult precodentwhich must on no account be repeated.
Tho Oonf er^enoe we re jpn-erally -impressed ttiththe difficulty of taking the action suggested bythe Minister of Health in advance of legislation;while they appreciated -the political difficultieswhich would arise, they felt that tho Minister ofHealth must insist on the observance of the law.Parliament had already strongly resisted the paymentmoney in advance of Parliamentary sanction;    thiswould involve expenditure, not merely in advanceof Parliamentary sanction but in defiance of the law.It was pointed out that, while the Ministersf Health must direct Guardians that suoh illegalpayments could not beunade a charge upon theMetropolitan- Common J?f*w Fund, the Guardians ooaid,if they chose, continue ,to bear the cost of the deduction out of their own rotes, and tho Ministerof Health would incur no responsibility in tho&apos; matter .Tho Conference agreed:(l)   that a&quot; final decision in thematter shculd be postponed, onthe understanding that if theposition became really acute,legislation could be passed.,although no action must bo takenin anticipation of suoh legislation.(2)    that the. Minister of health should inform Boards cf Guardiansthat tha inclusion of tho wholeor part of a disability pensionin computing the income of an applicant for outdoor &quot;relief wasillegal and that any sums illegallyexpended in oensequenoe could notbe made a charge upon theMetropolitan Common Poor Fund.^Whitehall Gardens,&apos; S*W.82nd December, 1921.

1. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP. 3519) on the subject of summer time. By theWar Emergency Laws Continuance Act of 1920 the power to make orders in Council for summer time was extended for a period ofone year after the termination of the war. The existing powers would therefore expire on the 31st August, 1922.The Home Secretary recommended that legislation should beintroduced for making summer time a permanent institution. Itwas very desirable, and had been strongly urged by the Postmaster-General, the Railway Companies and the Air Ministry, that summertime in this, country should coincide with summer time in Franceand in Belgium. Moreover, the practice of fixing by Order inCouncil different dates in different years had caused some incon-venience, particularly to Railway Companies, who prepared their time-tables a long while beforehand. Legislation fixing the datepermanently would have many advantages.As a result of a Conference between representatives of theHome Office and representatives of the French and Belgian Govern-ments an agreement had been reached that the representatives should recommend to their respective Governments that the periodof summer time should be from the night of the last Saturday inMarch (with certain modifications if that is the day before EasterSunday) to the night of the first Saturday in October; or alternatively the 1st October in the event of objection by theBritish Parliament to a later date.The Home Secretary asked for a decision that a Bill should beintroduced in the following Session, making provision for permanent legislation relating; to summer time on the above basis.The Chairman read a note by the Secretary of State for theColonies cordially supporting the proposal to make summer time apermanent institution. -   -The Secretary for Scotland stated that, while he had no doubtof the expediency of the general principle of summer time, he wasobliged to draw the attention of the Committee to the serious opposition expressed by Scottish farmers to the proposal. while he felt that these objections could not be allowed to stand in the wayof the adoption of summer time as a permanent institution, he mustobject to the date proposed in the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum,the first Saturday in October, which was too late. Were the periodlimited to the end of August, the objections as taken by agri-culturalists would be materially diminished. There would be veryserious criticism of the Bill by Scottish Members- in Parliament if so late a date as the first Saturday in October were fixed. Heenquired whether the advantages to be obtained by a coincidenceof the French, Belgian and English times were of such importance as to outweigh the objections felt by Scottish agricultural interests to prolonging summer time to the beginning of October.The Home Secretaiy pointed out that great inconvenience was felt, both by the travelling public and in respect of postal mails and railway services, in the short period during which the time in thiscountry did not coincide with that in France and Belgium. Forexample, the mails from the North of England had missed the Channelmail boats. It would also be necessary to prepare special railway and postal time-tables for the few days in which French and Belgiantimes did not coincide with English time. He also pointed out thatin each year except the first during which summer tinrj had been inforce the period had extended to the end of September or intoOctober. The French and Belgian Governments had made veryconsiderable concessions in order to meet us.Mr. Thompson, on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, statedthat English farmers also objected to the principle of summer time.There had not been so much opposition in the preceding summer asin the years before, but no doubt opposition would revive if the Actwere made permanent.   The Minister of Agriculture was prepared to
approve the general policy of summer time, but with reluctance inview of the agricultural opposition.The Secretary for Scotland stated that, in the circumstances, hewas not disposed to press his objection to the prolongation of theperiod now, subject, however, to the proviso that the matter mustbe open to reconsideration should serious opposition to the proposaldevelop.The Committee agreed : ]. To approve the Home Secretary&apos;s recommendation that a Billshould be introduced into Parliament in the following session, pi-oviding that the period of summer time shall&quot; begin from the night of the last Saturday in March (orwhen that Saturday is the Saturday preceding EasterDay, the last Saturday but one in March) and end on the night of the first Saturday in October.2. To request the Home Secretary to cause the necessary Bill tobe prepared and to arrange for its introduction inParliament.3. That the Bill need not be referred to the Committee forconsideration.4. To authorise the Home Secretary to request the ForeignOffice to inform the French Government that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have decided to introduce a Billin the terms agreed upon above.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,December 7, 1921.
