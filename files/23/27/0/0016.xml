&quot;lu. With reference to Cabinet 87 (21),Conclusion 1, the Cabinet were informed that after manymeetings with the Irish Representatives, an offer had beenmade to them on behalf of the British Government, the mostimportant of the provisions of which are to be found in thefirst 4 paragraphs of S.F;Ce29Ae       These provisions dealtwith the future constitutional status of Ireland, its relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government, theposition of the representative of the Crown in Ireland,and the Oath to be taken by the members of the IrishParliament,,     Ireland wmld under these provisionsacquire full nomlnion status, subject to one or twomodifications especially in regard to the Navy, and her position in t he Empire would be the same as that of thegreat self-governing Dominions *     In particular, therewould be no question of any veto by Great Britain uponpurely Irish legislation,,,attention was also drawn to the provisions inParagraphs 6 and 7 of F.0F0C*29Ao, under which H.M. imperial forces would undertake the defence by sea of the british islands including Ireland for a period of ten years, atthe expiration of which this provision would be reviewed at a conference of representatives of the British and irish Governmentsj   the Irish Government to give H.M.Imperial Forces certain specific facilities in time ofpeace and in time of war, as Indicated in paragraph 7.As regards Ulster, reference was made to the proposals in paragraph 12 and following paragraphs, under which,after the expiration of 6 months and before the expira-tion of 12 months from the date of the Agreement, the parliament of Northern Ireland could, by an addresspresented to His Majesty, request that the powers of thei Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shouldnot extend to Northern Ireland.     Provision was also made/
made for- -a..re-adjustment of the boundaries between Ulsterand the rest of Ireland and as to the question of safe-guards for the province of Ulster in the event of thatorovince coming under the Government of the Irish FreeState.These terms had been under consideration bythe Irish Cabinet, and there were indications that the division of opinion which had manifested itself amongthe Irish Representatives in London, also existed inthe Irish Cabinet.     Invny case, a majority of themembers of that Cabinet had rejected the terms andhad submitted counter proposals, which were summarised in S.F.C.32.     Attention was particularly directed to the first 5 paragraphs of S.F.C.32, from which itwas clear that the Irish Cabinet had no intention of coming within the British Empire, but wished ireland to remain an independent Republic associated with theBritish Empire for certain specific purposes, and bearingno allegiance to the King, but merely recognising him as the Head of the Associated States.     Attention wasaLso drawn to the provisions in Clause 7 of S.F.C.32respecting the coastal defence of Ireland by sea, andto the fact that the document contained no counterproposals regarding Ulster, from which it would appearthat no Sinn Fein objection would be forthcoming tothe proposals regarding Ulster, contained in S.F.C.29A.The Cabinet were informed that Mr. ArthurGriffiths, and Mr. Michael Collins, were greatly disappoint-ed at the rejection of the British proposals.     Thelatter appeared to be not unwilling to accept paragraphs1, 2, and 3, of SoF9Ct29A.     He would have preferred animmediate decision on Ulster, and he would have remittedthe question/
question of the ulster safeguards for discussion between representatives of ulster and the rest of Ireland,, Mr.Collins had been told that in the opinion of the british ministers it would be no use holding a plebiscite of thepopulation of Southern Ireland, unless at least some of theleaders were prepared publicly to recommend the acceptanceof the British terms*In the course of the general discussion the view was expressed that if the Irish representatives could be persuaded to accept paragraphs 1, 2, 3, (Constitutional),6, 7, (Naval), and possibly 9, (Customs), it might be advisable to try to meet them on the actual terms of the Oath ofAllegiancej paragraph 4.     It was pointed out that theIrish representatives objected to taking any oath of this character.     On the other hand it was represented thatgreat caution was necessary respecting the Oath of allegiance, having regard to the nature of the negotiations in the past, and that it would be disastrous if, after a settlement had been made, a different interpretationwas placed on so vital a matter in Great Britain and inIreland.     Emphasis was laid on the Importance in any future negotiations of pointing out to the Irish representa-tives that acceptance of the first 3 paragraphs of S.P.C.29A.would involve the recognition of the King in Ireland and,for example, that all writs would run in Hi3 Majesty1sname.In the course of the discussion, it was suggestedthat the following form of words should be substituted for those in paragraph 4 of S.PeC.S9jAi- ,I...... c...... ft o *......... c do solemnly swear truefaith and allegiance to the Constitution of the IrishFree State as by law established and that I will be faithful
to H,M* King George V,,, hi a ha4rs and&apos; successorsIreland with Great Britain and her adherence toand membership of the group of nations known as theBritish CommonwealtiuThere was general agreement that so long as thesubstance of the first 3 paragraphs of S.F.C.29.A, remain unaltered, the precise terms of the oath were immaterial.The Cabinet agreed--*(1) That at the meeting with the IrishRepresentatives at 2*30 p,m* this afternoon, the British representatives should endeavour to attain a settlement on the lines Indicated in the discussion;(2) That as regards the navalprovisions,the Secretary of State for the colonies should, after consultation with theNaval and Military experts, interviewthe Irish Representatives concerned witha view to securing their agreement withthe substance of paragraphs 6 and 7 ofS.PeC.29*A;-(3) That the Members of the Cabinet should hold themselves in readiness to attend a further meeting later in the afternoon0p NEGOTIATIONS. (2) In the course of the foregoing   discussionilageof    reference was made to the fact that there had appearedlrmation9in the &quot;Times&quot; newspaper on Saturday lasfe a full acooountof the British proposals which must have been given to the newspaper by some person in possession of the actual document.It was asserted that this information had not been revealedby the Irish Representatives who had been scrupulously honestin this respect throughout the negotiations.     It wassuggested that it might be worthy of consideration whetherproceedings should not be taken under the Official secrets act with a view to the discovery of the narte of the person who had furnished the information to the newspaper.by law. In virtue of the common citizenship ofThe Attorney-General undertook to look into the matter.) Whitehall Gardens,5th December, 1921,
