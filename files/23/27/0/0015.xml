(1)   The Cabinet--were Informed of a deplorable^incident in the Madras Presidency in which, owing to over--,crowding in a closed luggage van, about 60 out of 100convicted Moplah prisoners had lost their lives *   It was most unfortunate that this Incident should have haopened atthe moment when the Prince of Wales&apos; visit to India   wasproving So great a success,(2)   With-reference to Cabinet 84 (21)-Conclusions 2 and3 and to the Conference nf Ministers held on 18th November,1921, Conclusion 4, the Cabinet had..under conatderation thefollowing documents relative to the? present political andmilitary situation in the Hear Easo:-*Note by the Secretary of State for.War coveringNote by CI,G.S.

CoxCP.3460 and.C.P,3485oMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War,Co P.343The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary of taie for- Foreign Affairs that the immediate question for deOision related to the steps to be taken tcbring to an end the deplorable situation in thoNear East which had recently been.oomplciated by sthe controversy ixi\o which we had been plunged with france owing to the   action of the French/Government
Government in endorsing the agreement recently concluded between the Angora Government,and ii. Franklin-Bouillon.    On learning the terms ofthat Agreement he (Lord Curzon) had. addressed a questionnaire to the French Government (CP.3500)and after some delay the reply (CP.3501) of theFrench Government had now been received - speaking generally the reply was courteous and conciliatoryin tone, it offered explanations^ on certain-jointsand contained a number of assurances*w*iicl&apos;; itwould be advisable to take note of diplornatically&quot;-and utilize to the fullest extent -    In many respectshowever the reply was quibbling, casuistical anddisquieting and it vras not difficult to see thatthe French Government were much alarmed at themanner in which their proceedings were viewed &apos; notonly in Great Britain but also in Franco wherethe employment of K, Franklin Bouillon on this mission, the failure to consult tho BritishGovernment,    the departures from the Treaty of sevres and the blow to the Intente were all the subjects of severe criticism.    E. Briand wouldfindundoubtedly/:&apos; on his return that his position had been much 3haken   all the more because of hislack of s\;.ccess in America.As an example of the difficulty of dealingwith the French Government the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs reminded the Cabinet of theiroident in April 1921 mentioned in CP.3499 whenafter/
&quot;after- hi^--^faidoire^ &quot;wi with the Angora Government M. Briand had claimed thathe had informed the Prime Minister at ever-:.&apos; stage of the lines upon which he (M. 3riand) was proceeding.The Prime Minister, intervening, stated thatM. Briand had never said a word to him abouta separate Treaty with Angora and that he wasvery surprised indeed when he heard that aseparate Treaty had in fact been negotiated bythe French with Befeir^SamiJBey.The Secretary of State for &quot;oreign Affairsresuming reminded the Cabinet that one of themost disquieting features connected with therecent Agreement was the appended letter fromYussouf Kemal which vaguely referred to advantages in favour of France:    In reply to his enquiriesthe French had given specific assurances,which if genuine, were satisfactory, but there was goodto&apos;ground for thinking that in addition/&apos;the actualagreement there   were in existence secret pro-visions, the nature of which the French Governmentwere not anxious to divulge.    It must be recognisedthat the French reply left the following seriousBritish charges unanswered.(l) A piece of territory comprising10,000 square miles and containing the military approaches to Mesopotamiais handed over to the Kemalists.(2)The Christian population of Ciliciais left to the&quot;tender mercies of thetheTurk and/result would probable bemassacres on a wholesale scale.Everything possible/-     - was being/
was b^ing done both &quot;by British action on the spotand pressure- on. the French to alleviate thesituation of the refugees.(3)     The French had stolen a march on their Allies andhad by underhand methods obtained preferential treatment for French interests.     So far fromthe Agreement boing a mg)re tractation localeit applied tb the whole of Turkey.(4)     The action of the French. Government had done merethan anything else to improve the moaal   and increase the prestige of Mustapha X&amp;mal and so made it most difficult te reach a peaceablesettlement.     This had been done at the verymoment when the British G-overnment had succeeded in persuading&apos;the Greeks to plaoe themselves inthe hands of the Allies and when it appeared that there was some prospect of a solution being reached.The question of the next step to be taken must beconsidered from the diplomatic as well as from the military aspect,     Aa regards the former, recent communications fromSir H. Rumbold and notably a telegram lb. 724 dated12th November indioated the following possibly alternatives:-(l)     Tv get the French or possible the Italiansto sound Angora.(2)     To sound Angora ourselves, officially. eitherJointly with the Allies or in their name.(3)     To sound Angora ourselves unofficiallywith the knowledge of the Allies.Sir H. Rumbeld, after emphasizing the difficultyof dealing with Angora in its present mood, had pointedout that the Nationalists had their difficulties and that although
although, the more moderate elements might lean infavour of peace it was improbable that tho Kemalistswould consent to place themselves in the hands of theAllies.    Sir H, Rumbold favoured alternative (2)but advised that if possible action should be deferred until an Irish settlement was reached as such asettlement would have considerable effect in Angora,The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs thought that the   best course to adopt would be to-reply to the French Mote acknowledging its courteoustone taking particular note of the assurances andexplanations given and emphasizing the British-point of view and the paramount necessity of joint action.     After sending this reply he would suggestthat a definite proposal should be made to theAllies that the Kemalista should be invitedunconditionally and in general terms to a Conference,If the Allies agreed to this course the angora government should -then be sounded officially by theAllies and in this connection there was reason tobelieve that the situation would be greatly eased ifthe Eemalists were given to understand that on asettlement being reached Great Britain might boprepared to give Turkey some financial help by wayof a loan for rehabilitation purposes.In, the course of the subsequent discussion it was urged that as ovidence of good faith   and toavoid the serious consequences which would follow anationalist attack on Constantinople or a rising/in that
in that City it might he well for Great Britain tooffer to withdraw her troops   forthwith from Turkishterritory, suoh action would also help us politicallyin India, Egypt, -Palestine and. ileaopotamia (SeeC.P. 3474)*    On the other hand it was pointed out .that such evacuation at the presont time would merelybe regarded -by the. KemaJLLsts--as -an act- -of weakness^,that until the Greeks had been again driven &apos;.back there was no real danger of an attack onConstantinople, that arrangements could readily be made to suppress any rising In ConstantinopleItself and that Sir H0 Rumbold and General Haringtonwore opposed to evacuation except as part of a general settlement*It was generally agreed that while the conductof the French Government in connection with theFranklin-Bouillon Agreement was most reprehensible,no usoful purpose would be served by entering into an acrimonious discussion at the present time with thatGovernment, and that, while there was not much hopeof the proposed Conference proving   cucccrrfalthe policy suggested seemed the one which offered the best chance of re-establishing peace in theHear East.      In this connection the advantages fromthe British point of view of holding the Conference atConstantinople were emphasised.The Cabinet agreed -(1)    To approve the despatch to the FrenchGovernment of a reply to that Govern-ment&apos;s recent Hote (C,P.3501) on tholines Indicated by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.C2)
To approve the suggestion of theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs that a definite proposal should be madeto the Allies that the Komalists shouldbo invited unconditionally to a conference to be held early next year preferably atConstantinople,That if tho Allies agreed to the holding of the proposed Conference steps should betaken jointly with the Allies to approach the Angora Government with a view to the participation of that Government in theConference,That if and when necessary the angora government might be Informed that on asatisfactory settlement being reachedGreat Britain will be prepared favourablyto consider the grant to Turkey offinancial assistance by way of a properlysecured loan, the proceeds of which wouldbe ear-marked for rehabilitation purposes.That the question of the evacuation ofBritish troops in Turkish territory should be considered In connection withthe terns of a general settlement butthat there should be no such evacuationpending the opening of the proposed conference,ITISH 3.    In the course of the preceding discussioniERSSISETATIOKAHGORA,        emphasis was laid on the desirability of getting intodirect communication with the Angora Government, and itwas suggested that a suitable representative should boappointed who should go to Angora, at first in an un-official capacity, and should be given official statuswhen he had gained the confidence of the Kenallsts.3y this means liaison with the Angora Government wouldbe established with most beneficial consequences.   Onthe other hand it was pointed out that the attemptearlier in the year to open relations with 1&apos;iustaphaKemal through General Ilarington had resulted In failure,that Sir IIi Humbold was definitely opposed to thecourse suggested (Telegram Eo,724 pe4), that it wouldbe difficult for Great Britain to appoint an agent at the(2)II(3)(4)/moment
iism ;SGTOHpRSKCE,jnsament *moment when she vms complaining of Li. Franklin        ,Bouillon1s activities and that the despatch of an agent at the moment would &quot;be more likely to iErpcid.ILthan help the contemplated negotiations.The Cabinet agreed  To postpone the further considerationof the question of British representation at Angora until after it was know whetherthe pr-opo-s-ed &apos;JCrmference would be held.4.   With r^-erone-e&quot;-^jDaJ3inet-..85 Conclusion (9)the Cabinot were informed that a Treaty of friendship with Afghanistan had been signed at 2 p0m. that afternoon..Inter alia the Treaty provided for an Interchange ofConsuls and Ministers, the exclusion of the RussianConsulates, no subsidy, while the Amir expresses hisdetermination to get rid of Russian influences0On behalf of the Cabinet the Prime Ministercongratulated the Secretary of State for India on thesuccessful conclusion of the prolonged and difficult negotiations with the Amir,5*       The Cabinet had before them the Reports of the speeches delivered by M. Briand and Mr. Balfour at theThird Plenary Sitting of the Disarmament Conference --W.D.G, 10 and W.D.C.. 11,     The view was expressed that solong as France maintained her powerful army in being,the state of Europe would remain unsettled and that itwould be a most serious matter if as a result of theWashington Conference Great Britain was the only european power to be disarmed.The Cabinet agreed(1)    That the Committee of Imperial defence should bo requested to consider forth with the questions arising out of M. Briand&apos;sspeech (W.D.C.10) and to report to theCabinet thereon, with a viow to instructionsbeing sent to the British Delegates atWashington*
(2)       That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should he requested to inform mr * Balfour by cable (1) that II, Briand&apos;sproposals have been remitted to theCommittee of Imperial,Defence forconsideration^ \2) that it is hoped thatIvic Briandss proposals will not boaccepted by tho British Delegates as finaluntil tho result of the Cabinet examinationhas been communicated to them, and (3)that the Cabinet are alarmed at the prospectof Great Britain being the only power in europe to be disarmed under the Washingtonarrangements* (For telegram sent to Hr, Balfoursee Appendix V)a(6)   With reference to Cabinet 71 (21)^ Conclusion 5,tionthe Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum bythe First Commissioner of Works (CP,3484) covering a descriptive account of the Foreign Office muraldecorations prepared by Hr* Sigismund GoetzeoThe Cabinet were again reminded of the circumstancesunder which the decorations had been originallyoffered to and accepted by the Cabinet *    Opinionsfavourable to tho pictures had been expressed byleading British, French and Belgian artists and it was urged that the whole credit and good faith of the Officeof Works in the artistic world would vanish if at thisstage the pictures wore to be rejected a     On the otherhand it was represented that the Government were under no legal or moral obligation to accept the pictureswhich it was urged were not in harmony with the architectureof the Foreign Office.     Reference was made to the unfavourable views which had been expressed by eminentart critics, and it was suggested that a possible solution would be for the Cabinet to accept the pictures and arrangefor them to be placed in some building other than theForeign Office,-10- /The
11The general view of the Cabinet was that whatever opinion night be held as to the artisticmerits of tho pictures their rejection, in all thocircumstances, would constitute a breach of faith.&apos;with the artist.

Cypher telegram to Mr, Balfour (Washington&apos; Delegation)Foreign Office, 22nd November, 1921, S.30 pem8Following from Prime Minister.Government regard Briand!s statement regarding Frenchland and air armaments, net to speak of French attitude onsubmarines, with grave aru^lsty.     Reductions which heindicates will reduce troops with colours but will proportion-,ately increase reserve and they will in no way affectFrance&apos;s power to mobilise an army of overwhelming strength at very short notice^     His references to German disarmamentwere very disingenous.     So long as Germany has any menof military age they must of course be regarded as potentialsoldiers and the German Staff will no doiibt continue to workout plans for organising large numbers in formations and units.      But Germany has been deprived of all the essentialequipment of a large army.     She has given up large and small artillery, tanks, transport, aeroplanes, field-kitchens,machine guns, small arms and her whole reserve of munitions and none of these can be replaced without prolonged effortover a period of years which  could not be concealed..fromother Powers.     Briand&apos;s case is therefore no case and wecannot contemplate a result of the Washington-Conference whichwould leave France and other European nations as powerfullyarmed as before while we alone having already reduced the armyand the air force to the minimum had also bound ourselves toa great reduction of the navy,    This aspect of the question isbeing carefully considered by the Committee of Imperial Defense,and Government will communicate their conclusions as soon aspossible.   As these may involve strong representations atWashington please do not commit yourself meanwhile in. any wayto acceptance of the French position.

b-SIOTEtOR     (l) The Secretary *rf&quot;13tate--for Foreign Affairs reported  .tlmir--tht*-Hex-Emp^ attempt to regain the throne of hungary had failed^ and ho was now imprisoned in  an abbeyin Hungary.It was essential that he should be removed elsewhereat once from&quot; Hungary, where he was in a centra of intrigue.There w^r^ strong political objections to his internmentin Italy, partly owing to the propinquity of Jugo-Slavia.A suggestion had been made that ho should be takendown the Danube by Admiral Troubridge on board a british ship to Galata.   By a coincidence,a British ship would short-ly bo calling at Galatz and could take him on to Constantl-nople, whence he could be transported to a temporary resi-dertoe pending the selection of a permanent home.As regards the temporary residence, one suggestion had been Malta.   This, however, would be peculiarly incon-venient at a moment when the Prince of Wales was about to visit that. Island.   A better atiggestion would be to remove himto Gibraltar pending the decision as to his permanent home.As regards this permanent home, the Allied powers had already been in communication with the Spanish Governmentwith a view to an asylum in Spain.   Spain, with the approvalof the Powers, had accepted in principle, but the negotiations were still proceeding in regard to details.   Gibraltar wouldbe a peculiarly suitable place aa a temporary residence ifthe ex-Emperor was likely to find permanent asylum in aSpanish possession.   In the Balearic Islands one of theAustrian archdukes possessed an estate which might provesuitable as tha ex-Emperor&apos;s home.   The Canary Islands were a possible alternative.   In any case an island was desirable-Th*re was a short discussion in regard to the desira-bility or otherwise of the ex-Emperor^ internment in aBritish possession, and the majority of those present were opposed to Great Britain becoming his gaoler.-1-
After some further discussion the Conference agreedThat the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have discretion to arrangefor the removal of the ex-Fr.peror fromHungary *
ISGSPTIAI        (2) With reference to Cabinet 81 (81), Conclusion     4,Iiatiows...attention was drawn to the incorrect and ton&amp;acious articles in a number of the morning newspapers to the effect that aTreaty of Alliance with Egypt had been decided on in princi-ple, and that Mr. churchill was its author; and to the harmwhioh they might cause.The suggestion was made that those rumours probablyemanated from an Egyptian souroo.
SITUATION      (3)   With reference to Cabinet 81 (21)t conclusion INDIA3, a discussion took place in regard to the situationIn India.A Minute on the subject has been recorded in the secretariat, the substance of which will be communicatedverbally to the cabinet and which can be seen on application to the Secretary.
pFLCYl-INT *       I4) With reference to Cabinet SO ^81), Conclusion 5,jian Orders-.-., the-Secretary of State for India reported that, arisingout of telegrams Tjohich had passed between the Prime Ministerand the Viceroy, he was hopeful of reaching arrangements whereby considerable orders would be placed in Great Britain^from India without intervention by the British Government.
SB AMERICANIf MOWNIcafermentif Victoriaj?OSS,(5)   With reference to Cabinet 78 (21), conclusion* the Conferenoe considered the question of who should place the Victoria Cross on the grave of the AmericanUnknown Warriori and agreed to submit the following recommendation for the approval of His Majesty TheKing:-(a) That Admiral of the Fleet Earl Beattyshould be asked to place the VictoriaCross on the grave:(b) That General the Earl of Cavan%,acoompanyiingLord Beatty, should place,on the grave a wreath from His Majesty?(c) That the Admiralty should be responsiblefor communicating this decision to LordBeattyp and the War Office for communi-eating it to Lord Cavan:- (d)   That the Secretary of State for War shouldbe responsible for arranging for thepreparation of the Decoration, with aninscription on the reverse to road:THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR OF THE UNITEDSTATES OF AMERICA,and for its conveyance to Lord Beatty,who is now in the United States of America.(e). That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should notify the Governmentof the United States of America,-6-
(6)   The question was then raised as to whether an offer oxight also to be made to the FrenchGovernment to place the Victoria Cress on the grave of the French Unknown WarriorsThe Conference agreed:-That, without making any formalrepresentation to the French Government9opportunity might be taken by the PrimeMinister or the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, at some future meeting with M. Briand, to sound him Informallyas to whether this was desirable or note-6a
i7) With redTerenc-e to Cabinet   81  (21), Conclusion  1,irh^-^t^n^rta-ry of State for Foreign Affairs reported thatMo rc-ounaris, the Greek Priire Minister, was due to arrivethis evening, and had asked for an interview on the follow-lng day.The Conference took note, with approval,of Lord Curzon&apos;s intention to pressM. Gounaris as to whether Greece wouldbe ready for Allied mediation on thelines contemplated, but rejected byGreece, in the previous June.
(8) Subsequently, the Conference briefly discussed the activities of M. Franklin Bouillon, a French ex-Minister,at Angora, in regard to which various rumours had currency.The Secretary.of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Conference that the frontier between Cilicia and Turkey,agreed to at Aneora, was, he tmderstood, very similar tothat included in the Treaty of Sevres.Attention was called to the possible danger to Meso-potamla, and particularly Mosul, from the Turks, when relieved from anxiety in Cilicia,V/hitehol 1 Gardens, S.*. 1,October 26, 1921.-8-

?ATUS It was explained to the Committee that the question for^KRASSINS consideration was what reply should be returned to an enquiryfrom the Court of Appeal as to the status of Mc KrassimThere had already been a case before the Courts/, which involved the ownership of Russian gold in this country6The case had turned on a letter to the Court from theForeign Office which had been written before the conclusionof the Trade Agreement with Russian     The Court had decided then that the Russian representative did not possess the requisite standing and that the Russian gold was, there-fore liable to be attached^&apos;    Thi&amp; decision was to a great extent modified in. a later case when further enquiry hadbeen made of tho Foreign Office?     The present question arose in relation to the case of Fenton which was an action for the price of goods.     The plaintiffs had sought to joinM0 Krassin as a defendent and the Master in Chambers had refused on the ground that Mo Krassin had an ambassadorialstatus.   The plaintiffs took the case to a Justice inChambers who had sent It on to the Court of Appeale    Before&apos;proceeding further the Court had asked the Foreign Officeto reply to the two following questions(.1)   Whether H*M* Government had had any dealings with M* Krassin other than those on questions relating to trade *.(S) Whether he had been received as Representativeof the Soviet Government in any capacity otherthan head of the Russian Trade Delegation^The question was whether the Foreign Office should intheir reply state directly whether or not Ma Krassin was regarded by BUM, Government as a full representative of theSoviet Government, or whether an answer should be givensetting out the facts and leaving the decision as to M0
Kr&amp;ssiri&apos;s status to the Court of Appeal,General agreement was expressed with the view that no direct statement of opinion should be made by H,M.government as to the status of M, Krassin, but that the facts should beplaced before the Court and the decision left to them.The proposed draft reply by the Foreign Office was read to the Committee, the effect of which was that Ms Krassin hadbeen received by H.M, Government solely in his capacity as chief Official Agent in connection   with the Trade Agreementalthough the opportunity had been taken of his presence inthis country to discuss the question of the famine in Russiaand the exchange of prisoners.     The draft reply went on tostate that M, Krassin had never been received as Ambassadorby H,M, Government.     This reply, it was stated, represented the facts as known to the Foreign Office,     It would beimpossible to recognise M, Krassin as Ambassador because suchrecognition would carry with it recognition of the SovietGovernment as a de jure Government, whereas the rocognitionso far accorded to that Government had been more or lessthat of a de facto GovernmentsIt was pointed out that in a case   of this importance,the decision of which might involve the suspension of tradewith Russia since British traders would certainly refuseto do further business with a trading agent who had been declared by the Courts to possess diplomatic immunity from being sued, It was essential that the Court should have ..before it the full facts of the case.     As a matter ef fact1.1, Krassin had on certain occasions been treated informallyas the representative of tho Soviet Government.       Discussions,for instance, had been held with him regarding Poland, and theWar Office had put forward in June 1920 various proposals fordiscussion with him regarding military matters.     The PrimeMinister had himself seen M0Krassin at the time of the discussions/on
the subject or Poland when there had been a question ofa general European Conferences     The assent of theFrench Government had been obtained at Boulogne by thePrime Minister and Lord Curzon to the calling of such aConference and definite proposals had been put beforeM4 Krassin and M0 Kameneff by the Prime Minister.The Committee agreedThat the Cabinet Secretariat shouldoxamine the records of the discussions with M* K-rassin and communicatedetails of them to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs for inclusion ,of such as are relevant, In the replyto the enquiry from the Court of Appeal,2, Yittiitehall Gardens, S.i&apos;f.2nd November, 1921e

TemporaryIncreased ChargingPowers forTransportUndertakings.1. The Committee had before them a Memorandum(CP. 3439) by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofTransport.It was explained to the Committee that, as stated in the letterfrom the Ministry of Transport dated the 1st October, 1921(CP. 3359), a promise had been made to transport undertakingsthat, if the question were not dealt with otherwise by Parliament,the Government would introduce legislation continuing, till the15th February, 1924, the charging powers of canals, and would include the Acts under which temporary charging powers areconferred on Tramways, Docks and Harbours in the ExpiringsXaws (Continuance) Act, thus extending them until the15th February, 1924. The Railway Companies&apos; Association had,however, represented that the continuance for another year of&quot; The Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges)Act, 1920,&quot; would not apply to docks and harbours owned by railway companies, since the conditions of the Act made itimpossible for a railway company to make a successful applicationunder it. Unless, therefore, some further pledge were given, eachrailway company would be obliged to introduce a private &quot;Bill next session.It was, however, obvious that the railway companies wouldnot be in a better position in 1924, which was the limit of theextension they desired, since by that date the railwayamalgamations would not be complete, and all those companieswho owned docks and harbours would be obliged to bring in bills in or before that year. There were some twenty or thirty of suchcompanies. It had, therefore, been suggested that the temporarycharging powers as regards docks should be extended to two years from 1923, instead of one. This would mean that in 1925 thefour groups of amalgamated companies would only require tointroduce four Bills, and much money and parliamentary time would, therefore, be saved. The railway companies had agreedto this proposal, but its adoption would necessitate an extensionof time in the case of non-railway-owned docks until February1925. The proposal was open to criticism on the general groundthat its adoption would deprive Parliament of the power ofrevising the charges of dock and harbour undertakings, and would place that power in the hands of a Committee. The justification of the proposal was that when the existing legislation, whichterminates the 15th February, 1923, was passed it was thoughtthat by 1923 prices and conditions would have become sufficientlystable to enable permanent maxima to be fixed. It was unlikelythat this anticipation would be realised, and it would, therefore,be reasonable to continue temporary legislation for one year. The,justification for the further extension of time to two years, andfor making the principle of fixing charges by ministerial orcommittee decision permanent (as was desired by tramway under-takings), must be sought on other grounds.It  was  not  thought  that  much,  if  any,   parliamentary opposition would arise to the proposal to extend the temporary. increase of charges for one year, at any rate.It was generally agreed that there was no objection toinforming the railway companies that temporary increase of charges in the case of railway-owned docks and harbours wouldbe provided for until 1924, but that it would be desirable to leave for later settlement the decision of the question whether theincreased charges should be continued until 1925.As regards tramways, it was pointed out to the Committeethat tramway undertakings would be required under presentlegislation to introduce in the next session a large number ofprivate Bills. The tramway undertakings with almost completeunanimity had requested that permanent legislation should be passed to release them from the obligation of coming to Parlia-
National Health 2. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theinsurance. Minister of Health (CP. 3427), together with a Draft of theNational Health Insurance (Prolongation of Insurance)  Bill(CP. 3427 A).It was explained to the Committee that owing to the presentcontinuance of unemployment, a number of unemployed personswill shortly have been unemployed for twelve months. their membership of Approved Societies will consequently terminate,and on return to employment they will be treated as if they hadnot previously been insured. The Approved Societies, and other bodies, had drawn attention to the hardship which would thusarise, and the proposed Bill had been drafted to preserve theinsurance rights of the persons in question. The Bill was non-controversial in principle, and had been agreed by all Depart-ments concerned, and by the Approved Societies.The Committee agreed That the Minister of Health should be authorised to intro-duce the National Health Insurance (Prolongation of insurance) Bill into Parliament.3. With reference to  Cabinet 78 (20),  Conclusion 6,  theFood Control Committee bad under consideration a Memorandum by the BoardUrders- of Trade (CP. 3435) relating to :-(i.) The only remaining restrictive Order under the Ministryof Food Continuance Act concerning the sale of food,(ii.) The statistical returns of stocks of foodstuffs collected by the Board of Trade,(iii.) The returns of slaughtered cattle.Sale of Food.(i.) The only restrictive Order under the Ministry of FoodContinuance Act in force is the Sale of Food Order, whichconcerns the sale of bread and tea by net weight, and the description on sale of jam and edible fats.ment, and to transfer the, duty to fixing tramway charges from parliament to the Minister of Transport. It was thought thatthis almost unanimous request should be brought to the notice ofthe Committee, although it was realised that a large question ofprinciple was involved.The Committee agreed (1.) That the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of *Transport should be authorised to inform the railwaycompanies that the increased charging powers ofrailway-owned docks and harbours will be extended(until the 15th February, 1924) subject to a power ofrevision vested in the Minister of Transport, acting on the advice of a Committee.(2.) That the question of making permanent the presentsystem, whereby charges for tramway undertakings are fixed bv the Minister of Transport on the advice of aCommittee, should be postponed for further considera-tion by the Home Affairs Committee.(3.) That a Bill should be prepared for the consideration ofthe Committee, continuing until the 15th February,1925, and making applicable to railway-owned under-takings &quot; The Harbours, Docks and Piers (temporary increase of Charges) Act, 1920.&quot;
The President of the Board of Trade recommended that this order should be revoked at the end of the year.The provisions for the sale of tea by net weight and thelabelling of imported produce were, in his opinion, beneficial,but he doubted whether Parliament would favour permanent legislation to secure;their continuance.The Order for the sale of bread by net weight had provedsatisfactory. A Ministry of Food Committee, presided over byJLord Rathcreedan, had recommended that the principle of a fixedminimum weight for loaves should be embodied in an Act ofParliament.It was.explained to the Committee that the law relating tothe sale of bread by weight was based upon somewhat obsoleteBread Acts of 1822&apos;and 1836. The Order under the Ministry ofFood Continuance Act required not only that bread should be soldby weight, but that loaves offered for sale should always be of the exact weight of 1 lb. or a multiple of 1 lb.The President of the Board of Trade said that if the Orderwere revoked there was certain to be a demand for permanent legislation bringing the law relating to the sale of bread in harmony with modern requirements, but this would involve a complicated and troublesome Bill, and, in his opinion, the present time was not suitable for the introduction of such a measure.On the other hand; bakers would resent the continuance ofcontrol, and so soon as the price of flour was stabilised he consideredthat competition would afford purchasers sufficient protection.After some discussion the Committee agreed That the following Orders under &quot; The Ministry of FoodContinuance Act (Statutory Rules and Orders, 1921, No.1305) &quot; should be withdrawn: Part 4, relating to the sale of jam.Part,5, relating to the sale of fats.Part 1, paragraph 3, prohibiting the sale of rollsexceeding 2 oz. in weight.The Committee further agreed- (1.) That the remainder of Part 1, relating to the sale of bread; Part 2, relating, to the sale of tea; and Part 3,relating to the labelling of imported produce offered for sale, should be reserved for further^consideration.(2.) That the President of the Board of Trade should submit a Memorandum for the consideration of the Committeeshowing what legislation would be required to amend the Bread Acts of 1822 and 1836 so as to bring them into conformity with modern requirements.Statistical Returns of Stocks of Foodstuffs.(ii.) It appeared from the Board of Trade Memorandum(CP. 3435), above referred to, that the Cabinet at the end of 19,20had favoured the retention of these returns, owing to the acutedifficulty at the outbreak of war, caused by the absence of accurate information as to stocEs of foodstuffs. The President of theBoard of Trade was in favour of only retaining the returns as towheat arid wheaten flour until the latest possible date, the 21stAugust, 1922, having in view that in the meantime it might bepossible to pass permanent legislation to authorise theircontinuance.The Committee were informed that the Secretary of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, although not authorised to speakfor that Committee in this matter, was still of the same opinion asthat expressed in the Memorandum (CP, 2319), which had been
before the Cabinet when the matter was considered in 1920 (Cab.78 (20), Conclusion 6), viz., that in our preparations for war before1914, and at the outbreak of war, great difficulty had been experienced owing to the absence of statistical information of stocks of foodstuffs. - He appreciated the great need for economy,but statistics of wheat and wheat flour were of great importance and cattle food was also important.A skeleton scheme for securing returns in an emergency wouldbe better than nothing, and he would be satisfied with statistics for wheat and flour, together with a scheme for setting up themachinery for obtaining complete information in an emergency.In his opinion, the matter was one for decision by some higher authority.The First Commissioner of Works, in his capacity as Chair-man of the Wheat Commission, stated that a skeleton scheme forthe collection of wheat and flour statistics had already beenprepared.The Committee agreed That the collection of statistical returns of stocks of foodstuffsshould be abolished.Returns of Slaughtered Cattle.(iii.) It was pointed out in the Memorandum by the Board ofTrade above referred to (CP. 3435) that the Cabinet had decidedthat the Minister of Agriculture and the Food Controller shouldmake their staff arrangements on the basis that the returns of cattle slaughtered in this -country should be maintained. Theinformation was forwarded to the Board of Trade, where it wastabulated and forwarded to the Ministry of Agriculture. TheScottish Board did not attach much value to them, but the Ministryof Agriculture found them useful. They would become lessaccurate now that the Licensing of Slaughter Houses Order hadbeen revoked. The President of the Board of Trade was not sure that they were worth retaining, but, if so, suggested they shouldbe made direct to the Ministry of Agriculture.Mr. Dunbar, on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, stated that the question largely turned on whether theCommittee of Imperial Defence wished these statistics continued.If they were not continued, the annual census of live stock wouldbe the only complete information available for estimating thesupply and consumption of home-produced meat. The returnsnow being considered were the only adequate source of informa-tion in the period intervening between one annual census andanother.The President of the Board of Trade said that his Depart-ment were not at all sure that the returns were reliable.The Committee agreed That the collection of returns of slaughtered cattle should be abolished.Local Authorities(financial provisions) Bill.4. With reference to H.A.C 98, Conclusion 1, the Committeehad before them Memoranda from the Ministry of Health(CP. 3430 and CP. 3443) relating to the Local Authorities(Financial Provisions) Bill, together with a copy of the Bill.At the meeting above referred to the Committee had alreadyconsidered the clauses of a Bill and had approved a proposal for atemporary increase of the London Equalisation Rate. In conse-quence of a meeting of representatives of the London borough councils, this had been abandoned in favour of a proposal toextend the principle of the Metropolitan Common, Poor Fund tooutdoor relief, and in view of- the urgency of the matter and theunanimity of the Borough Councils, the Bill as thus amended hadalready been introduced in the House of Commons.
By Clause 1 (1) of the Bill it was proposed to raise the charge upon the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund for the maintenance ofindoor paupers from bd. per head per day to Is. 3d. per headper day.Clause 1 (2) provided for the extension of the MetropolitanCommon Poor Fund to outdoor relief so as to equalise the chargeall over London. Possible abuses would be prevented by regula-tions issued by the Minister of Health.Clauses 2, 3 and 4 were agreed to by the Home AffairsCommittee at their last meeting.A further point was raised in the Memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP. 3443) relating to the extent, if any,-towhich Boards of Guardians should be allowed to ignore disability pensions in estimating the income of an applicant for the purposeof assessing the amount of relief to be given. The only cases inwhich Guardians in granting relief were required to ignore anypart of the income receivable by the applicant were sick pay and benefits under the Outdoor Relief (Friendly Societies) Acts and national Health Insurance Acts of not more than 5s. and 7s. Qd.a week respectively, and unemployment benefit of not more than10s. a week.By the Unemployed Workers Dependants&apos; (TemporaryProvision) Bill at present before the House of Commons, it was proposed to suspend the operation of the last-named exception.It was doubtful whether as a matter of strict law the regulations to be made under the Bill could empower the Guardians to ignoreeither the whole or a part of a disability pension. On the otherhand, strong pressure would no doubt be brought to bear by theex-Service Men&apos;s Organisations.The Committee were impressed,-&apos; on the one hand, by the factthat the whole of a recipients income ought to be taken intoaccount in considering whether he was destitute, and, on theother, by the fact that some consideration must be given to thecircumstances of war pensioners, who were entitled to special regard on account of pain and suffering and the necessity for extra nourishment.The Committee took note of &quot;the revised form of the LocalAuthorities (Financial Provisions) Bill.The Committee agreed (1.) That no special provisions should be inserted in theLocal Authorities (Financial Provisions) Bill to empower , Boards of Guardians to ignore disability pensions in estimating the income of an applicant.(2.) That the Minister of Health should be authorised in theevent of the matter being raised in the debate to agreeto an amendment to empower Guardians to ignore apart of the disability pension in estimating the income of an applicant?(No exact sum was laid down by the Committee,but the general feeling appeared to be that if thematter were pressed, 7s. Qd. a week should be the surafixed on the analogy of the exception made in the- caseof sick pay and benefits under the National HealthInsurance Acts.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 27, 192i.o
