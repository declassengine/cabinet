EGYPT.

1. With reference to Cabinet 85(21), Conclusion 5, the Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.3453), the Report of Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee, (C.P.3468) together with a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War on Military Requirements in Egypt (C.P.3465).

THE PRIME MINISTER stated that it was important to discuss certain aspects of the Egyptian question with Lord Allenby, who was returning to his most to-morrow. The main question in regard to which he especially desired to learn Lord Allenby&apos;s views, was the disposition of the troops. He enquired if there was any place on the sweet water canal, between Cairo and ?, where the troops could be located if the Egyptian Government consented to build the necessary barracks.

LORD ALLENBY was of an opinion that a site could be found near Zagazig on the sweet water canal. It would be an unpopular station among the troops as compared with Cairo and Alexandria, but it would be healthy. Water could be obtained there from shallow wells in the event of the sweet water canal being cut. Tel-el-Kebir was the nearest point to Cairo where there was cultivation. The sweet water canal could be blocked in two or three days, but it would take a week for it to run dry at zagazig. In reply to questions, LORD ALLENBY stated that if the troops were removed from Cairo and Alexandria, the Europeans would be left without immediate protection, but troops at Abbassia and Mustapha could reach Cairo and alexandria in about an hour. Between Abbassia and the Residency in Cairo lay four miles of the most populous part of the town, which separated the European quarter from the troops.

If he returned to Cairo now leaving the negotiations still in progress, it was possible that no disturbances might occur. There might be a general strike, but he believed he could, maintain order for a time with the present garrisor.
He-share &amp; the-^views- expressed, in the War Off tee memo randum(0.P.3465)  as regards the military situation,      If disburb-ances occurred the existing troops would be sufficient tocarry on only, for a limited time.     The;/ would soon beimmobilised by exhaustion,  as they would be required to beon duty continuously to protoot vital ooints,  including thePower Station otitside Cairo,     During the U19-20 disturb-ances the Egyptian army had behaved well on &quot;the whole-    Allthe young officers in tho Egyptian army are aaghlulists.He admitted that it might be possible to surest Saghlul anddeport him from the- country-wiihcut an em lo si on, but hewas not inclined to take action against him until he had committed an offence which would justify his arrest/     If.Zaghlul were arrested now,  Adly would be suspected of havingcaused his arrest, in order to justify him in making a badsettlement with the Sritish Government.L.0H.D iLLEtJBY thought it would be disastrous for himto return to Egypt with the public announcement that negotia-tions with Adly had failed.     Ee believe! that would havethe result of raising Saghlul to the summit of power;    Adlywould resign;    there would be a renewal of the extremistagitation, and tho prestige of the British Government wouldvanish.      Ho regarded an immediate decision as to our future policy.in Egypt as essential.     He thought that the decisionto grant a convention on the terms agree-:; to J?y the Cabineton 11th July, 1921, ( 0.!P.5453, Column A.) would, cause generaldisappointment in Egypt:    but he- believed that Adly couldcarry on the Government in such circumstances if he was?. assured that he had the firm support of HvM.Government.    Itwas unlikely that disturbances would occur of such character as would call for the despatch of reinforcements.Personally/
Personally he ^would  prefer an offer of tex- a s to we liberalthan those proposed in Column A, in fact, approximating tothose shewn in Column B to he made; hut he could not advise on this point with confidence.The view was expressed that a. convention b-sed&apos; on the clauses in Column B would he preferable to that of Colui n A.To offer the more liberal terns would place us in a morefavourable light - with&apos; the Egyptians, the I uslim.World ingeneral, and public opinion at home.    Islam was against usin all quarters of the world and it was important that ourrelations with the Iduslim world should be improved.    Improvedrelations with Egyptian rations.lists would be a first step towards the re-establishment of friendship with Islam.The maintenance of order in Egypt was not a purely military problem.    It was possible that a general strikemight be organised or a strike of Governments ei ployeeswhich would throw the country into chaos.    Such a situ tioncould only be contemplated with dismay.   Egyptiannationalism was a force which must be reckoned with..    Itwas in a largo measure due to English ideas an,&quot;, &quot;nglisheducation, and we must endeavour to guide it into usefulchannels.    If a generous offer were now made to Egypt;grave, dangers might be averted.   Further the Governmentwas committed by the publication of the Ellner Report,which had been greeted with almost universal approval bythe press.   Public opinion expected concessions to be offered to Egypt which would not fall far short of those proposed in. the Eilner Report.    Our position in europe was so stron-; that such concessions could; not be rear edas weakness so long as we had troops on the spot &apos; e snoul,have control over Egypt.On the other hand it was pointed out that as the pro-posals in column 3 were no more likely to be .acceptedby Adly pasha than those in column a, to offer E ^ouldonly mean that we had uselessly made concessions -&quot;r 1 cbwe wished to avoid.    It was ougaested that the best- 3 - course/
course would bo to offer Column &quot;a&quot;, and on Its rejectionto put into operation those, clauses which depended upon our action alone, and take all necessary stops to reducet.0 a minimum the evil consequences of the rejection&amp;f our proposals by tho Egyptian Government.It was recognisei that to offer no more than was contained In Column &quot;A&quot; after the Foreign secretary had, been conducting negotiations with Adly Pasha forseveral months, would place him in a difficult position.It was not fair to expect him to carry on negotiationsfor that time without conceding anything.      If further concessions were made,  it was preferable.to yield onthe question of Egyptian representation in foreign capitals, than in regard to the disposition of thetroops maintained in Egypt.     The title of Ambassadorproposed In Column &quot;B&quot; was considered open to serious objection.      It would be difficult for the egyptian government to refuse to -receive an Ambassador from France or one of the other Powers,  if they desired to be sorepresented.In summing up.the discussion, the PRIME minister stated that the general feeling of the Cabinet was thatwhile the concessions proposed in Column &quot;A&quot;&apos; were beyond whatthe Cabinet would have proposed had they not been committed by tho publication of tho Milnor Report, in the circumstances the proposals in Column &quot;A&quot; should be offered.      he deprecated making concessions that would have lasting badeffects in order to meet temporary difficulties.      It was clear that at this stage of her development Egypt couldnot have real independence;    British control must be retained.4 There/
There was no use in granting concessions in hopes ofconciliating Muslim opinion;    the Muslims would only think we were frightened of them.     For thousands of years the Egyptians had never enjoyed self-government.    &quot;whenever they were left alone tho country foil into confusion andforeign intervention became necessary.&apos;    That had happenedseveral times in the. course of history;      it  would happenagain.     -Tf we withdrew,  some other foreign Power wouldtake our/place in Egypt.   ,.Broadly our attitude should bethat which we had adopted/ in. the case of India.     He was opposed to the title of Ambassador for the british representative;    he should.have some title that connectedthe association of Egypt with British power, and would shewthat Egypt had Britain at hand to support and help her.He believed that the negotiations with the EgyptianDelegates had done good, and that&apos;Adly Pasha had beenpleased to negotiate with the British Government.It was pointed out that in Column &quot;A&quot; (I) Terminationof Protectorate, it was stated that His Majesty1s Governmentwould recognise Egypt as an independent State, but thatthe -subsequent clauses of the _Conve.nt.ion really deprivedEgypt of her independency,     The Egyptians would inevitablypoint out the inconsistence and would charge ^^s with bad faith..      It was. suggested that for &quot;independent&quot;&apos; someother word, such as &quot;self-governing&quot;, &quot;autonomotis&quot;,, or&quot;sovereign&quot;&apos;, should be substituted.The Cabinet agreed.*-IjU   That&apos; the terms of. the Convention, as approved by the Cabinet on fluly 11th, 1921,(Column &quot;A&quot; of CP.  3453) should be adhered to subject to the amendments enumeratedbelow.

Further, the more money spent onsuch relief works,  which were usually very costly,i.the less would there be available for more remunerativemethods of stimulating trade..The Cabinet agreed --That the principle of paying a rate lower than the  districtrate should be firmly adhered toeven at tho risk of a defeat ofthe Government; and that theChancellor of the exchequer should be prepared to defend the policy of the Cabinet on financial grounds.IRISH 4.
