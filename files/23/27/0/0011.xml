The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the Cabinet an account of his recent conversations with M. Gounaris and M. Baltazzi, the Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister respectively, who had come to London from Paris, where they had received a somewhat chilly reception, and were going on to Rome. The Greek Ministers had not denied that the military position of the Greek Army was as unfavourable as stated in the Memorandum by the General Staff (C.P.3434). In fact, as Lord Curzon informed the Cabinet, there was evidence, which he had not mentioned to M. Gounaris, that the situation was if anything worse, e.g. the bad moral of the Greek Army, many desertions, and the precarious political position of the Greek Government.
After Mi -Gounaris had *seeh reminded of the rejection;4t at least ndn*-aceeptan^e, by the Greek Government of theterms suggested by the Allies or. no less than threeiceasicns, Lord Curzeh had urged that the Greek Governmentshould entrust their interests to the Allied Powers,,M* Gounaria had stated his willingness to place Greekinterests in the hands of Great Britain, but Lsrd Our onhad pointed out that^ while Great Britain might be morefavourable to Greece than France or Italy, it was impossiblefor him to dissasociate herself frem the Allies.Lord Curzdh had then asked whether Mo Gounaris would place himself in the hands of the Powers on the understanding thatthey would wdrk for a solution on the basis proposed in June^1921, namelyj in its broad outline] Smyrna to be made an autonomous province with a Christian Governor and an Inter-national gendarmerie, and Thrace to be provided for as in theTreaty of Sevres with a rectification cf the frontier Infavour of Turkeye     After consulting his colleagues,Mo Gounaris had stated their willingness to accept mediation ohthis basis, subject to the approval cf the Greek Government,to whom they must refer.     Lord Gurzen anticipated that, onthe following morning,- Ma Gcunaris would be in a position tooommunicate a definite acceptance.The next step, Lord Curzon continued, would have been to approach Prance and Italy with a view to a communication to theTurkish Government.     The forces of the Angora Government werewasted and exhausted and there was some reason to believe thatthey might be prepared to come t^ termso     The ConstantinopleGovernment was notoriously anxious for peace *The whole situation, however, had been transformed withinthe last few hvurs by the receipt from the French Government**f the Treaty concluded by M. Franklin Bouillon with MustaphaKeraal, Tfoich contained provisions which were a breach cfhonour and good faith and &quot;were most detrimental to BritishInterests.     Lord Curzon explained that the French Government
had repeatedly stated - twice in writing - that M, FranklinBouillon was not an emissary of the Government hut a privateindividual, engaged in a concession hunting missidn, who hadbeen authorised to carry out conversations with a view topaving the way to an agreement.     This could hardly be objectedin view of the fact that Prance had no less than 80,000 menunder arms in Cilicia; and was deeply Interested in the questionof the release of prisoners and the evacuation of her troops.On an analysis of the new Treaty, however/ it was clear thatthis well-known politician had concluded an agreement of a very different order.Lord Curzon then proceeded to give the Cabinet an analysis of the agreement, which he undertook to circulatetogether with his observations.Article 1 provided for the conclusion of a separate peace with Turkey.     This might be regarded as a breach of theTreaty &amp;f September 4th, 1914, by which Great Britain and Franceagreed rv&amp;i %0 make a separate peace.     The Cabinet, however,felt that in view of the uncertain status of Mustapha Kemalas a technical rebel against the Constantinople Government,this would not be a point to emphasise too strongly in any representations to the French Government.Article S and Article 5 wore both violations of the tripartite Agreement? the latter Article in particular made no adequate provision for the protection of minorities, whichwas definitely imposed by the Tripartite Agreement as toFrance and Italy within their respective spheres of interest.Article 7 contained the most objectionable features,traced a frontier between Turkey and the mandated territory of Syria, t&amp;which w as much more favourable to Turkey than the Treatycf Sevres. The French had no right whatsoever in this ray to dispose of territory which had been handed over to the Allies,and their action was the more reprehensible owing to the fact
that the territory had been conquered for the Allies by theBritish forces..     By the agreement in question fertile terri-tories would be handed over to the Turko     Furthermore, thestipulations in the Treaty of Sevres in regard to the BaghdadRailway had been ignored, and, under the new Agreement theTurks would be at liberty to use the railway ftr purposes ofmilitary transport.     ^he railway could even be utilised forthe transport of troops to attack Mosul.In addition to the agreement, **ord Curzon reported thatthere was a letter from Yusuf Kemal which contained someambiguous and disquieting proposalso     Moreover, information from secret sources tended to confirm the most disquietingfeatures of these proceedings,,In view of the French action, Lord Curzon felt that the steps he had contemplated to follow up the conversations withM8 Gounaris must be postponed until he had cleared up thesituation with the French Government, in regard to which he made definite suggestions - although he pointed out that the dif-ficvilty   of making representations was materially increased by the departure of M. Briand and all the principal officials of theQuai DJOrsay for washington in the subsequent prolonged discussion, emphasis was laid on certain disquieting features of the situations     Pranceappeared to be adopting an attitude definitely hostile toBritish interests in the Hear Eastf     The growth of frictionwith France was the more disagreeable insofar that france was still heavily armed particularly from the point of view cfaerial armaments.     The most sinister feature in the Agreementreceived from the French Government was that part dealing withthe Baghdad Railway and it appeared to lay Mosul open to theTurks while the French would look on with satisfaction if
Mustapha Kemal were to carry   his activities In thatdireotiono   The situation in the Near East had. heensteadily and remorselessly developing and had seriously affected our relations with Prance without, our gaininganything in return.     The situation in Mesopotamiawas preaarioUs, and would become even more so with theFrench helping Mustapha Kemal *     A suggestion wasmade to the effect that there was a tendency to regardMustapha Kemai as much more powerful than he really wasand further that Information received In the past as regardsthe Inefficiency and shortcomings of the Greek army had not always been correct, and that the same might prove to be the case now.,   Emphasis was laid on the effect theTurkish situation was having in India, and the diplomatictriumph which the French Government would win in coming to an agreement with Mustapha Kemalo     Italy did not countand with an agreement concluded between the French Govern^ment and Mustapha Kemal, Great Britain, and Great Britainalone, would be regarded as the enemy of the Turks*juieutenant-General Sir G cK* Harington gave to theCabinet his views regarding the military situation in asia minor and the efficiency of the Greek Army, and undertook toobtain by telegraph the latest Information available concern-ing the state of that Army*As regards the action to be taken to deal with thesituation as modified by the communication which had beenreceived from the French Government, it was generally agreedthat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs must ask that Government for an explanation of the action taken and forinformation as to their future Intentions, but somedifference of opinion was expressed as to how this shouldbe done*     On the one hand, it was suggested that theFrench Ambassador should be informed that His Majesty1s&quot; 5- &quot; /Government
Government had received the terns of the.proposed Agreement withastonishment and dismay and could not believe that the FrenchGovernment seriously contemplated approving Its terms p and, on theother hand, it was strongly urged that there mere serious objections to taking any action which would tend to cause friction between the two Governments, and, that while merely taking note of the proposed agreement the attention of the French Governmentshould be called to the i^egrettable fact that although we had tried to work hand in hand with them In directing our HearEastern policy, they proposed now entering into an agreement behindour backs which was thoroughly hostile to British interests^It was also suggested that if any protest were made, it shouldbe accompanied by some action, and that the British Government shouldp-ose neither as the.friend of the Turk nor the friend of the Greek,nor as a seeker after mines or other concessions, but as a peaces-maker aSeme difference of opinion was also evident regarding thedesirability of entering into direct communication withMuetsrpha Kemal*     On the one hand it was girgued that direct negotiations should be commenced withotit delay with a view tocoming to some agreement, even if it meant sacrificing certaininterests in Asia Minor, and one the other hand It was stronglyargued that Great Britain was in a very different position toFrance who had a large force of troops in cilicia and frontiersmarching with those cf the Angora Government, and it was asked what excuse there would be for the British Government enteringon such negotiations, as there was really nothing to make peaceover*     At the same time it would be quite another matter toenter Into communication with Mustapha Kemal with a view tomediating between Greece and Turkeys   and the trend of opinion was in favour of this being done provided a favourable reply was received from Me Gounarise
Inaliation.(3)     With reference to Cabinet 70 (21), Conclusion 5, theCabinet Joad &quot;before^- them., the following documents relating toIraq i-Telegrams from Sir P. Con,CP, 3378.CP, 339CCP, 3402,Memo, by the Secretary of State for War,CP, 3395,Memo, by the Secretary of State for War,CP. 3445 aThe Secretary of State for the Colonies raised the questionof Peisal being allowed to outer into direct negotiation with mustapha Komal,It was pointed out that according to reports which hadbeen received it appeared that unofficial communications hadalready passed and it was argued that although it was unlikelythat Peisal could make any satisfactory arrangement, so longas ho was friendly with Groat Britain, there appeared to be noobjection to permission being granted for the negotiations totake place,    On the other hand, attention wasc ailed to theisal were given permission to negotiate, hewould be doing exactly the same as  -v.e were complaining of theFrench having done , -that he was the Monarch of a mandated territory for which tho mandate had not yet been received, andthat the British Government would have to take all responsibilityThe trend of the discussion was In favour of Feisal beingdefiniteallowed to negotiate, subject to/ limitations as to thescope of tho negotiations.ftiitehall Gardens, S.W.,2nd, November, 1921.
