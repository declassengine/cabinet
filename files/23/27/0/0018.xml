In his view responsible opinion in the Armyin Ireland would favour immediate release.It was pointed out that it would be more difficult for the Irish Parliament to reject the Articles ofagreement if the internees had been released as an act of clemency immediately after the signature ofthose Articles.The Cabinet unanimously   agreedThat the&apos;Prime Minister should take the(first convenient opportunity of r;u;-y;e-.iti.n:-;- to His kajesty the Kin.;; that instructions should be riven for the immediate releaseof all the Irish internees an.i.&quot; without waiting for the ratification by DailEireann of the Articles of Agreement.2,.   &apos; With reference to Cabinet 90 (21), Conclusion 4,the Cabinet were informed that the Irish delegates had been notified that the question of the convictedprisoners must bo postponed for a general amnesty and&apos;that any amnesty would have to be a mutual one.

It was urged that no formal resolutionapproving the Articles of Agreement should be passedbut that the Address in reply to His Majesty?s speechshould take the form of thanking His majesty and stating that Parliament approved the Articles and ;..would take s.$eps to pass the necessary legislation to give effect to them.The question was then raised whether the Houseof Lords and the House of Commons should simultaneously        -   jdebate the Address or whether the motion should notbe first moved &amp;n the House of Commons and subsequentlysent on to the House of Lords, following the precedentset at the time of the Act of Union.j !The Cabinet agreedTo request the Prime Minister, theLord Privy Seal and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to settle theprocedure in consultation^

The Cabinet were informed that in the eventof Pail Eireann accepting the Articles of Agreementprovision would have to be made for financing theProvisional Government of Southern Ireland.      If itwas decided to take advantage of the&apos; 1920 Act, Crown-Colony Government could be set up and the Sinn Feinleaders could be nominated as rulers under that Act.While under this plan no special financial arrangements would be necessary it had the disadvantage that itwould involve a dissolution of the Southern parliament and such dissolution could only be carried out withthe assent and approval of Sinn Fein.      The alternative would be to set up an administration in Soiithern ireland on an admittedly irregular basis and. subsequentlyobtain an Act of Indemnity.      In this case theAdministration would require to be financed and a financial resolution would have to be submitted toParliament.The Cabinet agreed --To refer the question of the financial arrangements to be made for the ProvisionalGovernment of Southern Ireland to thefolio w i &apos;j. ig 0 o mm I o t e e : -The Lord Chancellor (In the Chair),Chancellor of the Exchequer,Secretary of State for WarChief Secretary for IrelandwithT-ir.
