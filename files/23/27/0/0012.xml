(6) With reference to Cabinet 81 (21) Conclusion 5 the Cabinet had before them the following documents:-

Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Paper No. C.P. 3453.

Conclusions of Lord Curzon&apos;s, Sub-Committee, Paper No. C.P. 3458.

The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs stated that he had given the Cabinet a general account of his discussions with Adly Pasha and the Egyptian Delegates. He had been requested by the Cabinet to draw up a paper showing parallel columns the principal clauses of the proposed convention; (Column (a) as approved by the Cabinet on July 11th, 1921;   Column (b) modification of those clauses as proposed by Lord Curzon; and Column. (c) additions as demanded by the Egyptian Delegation (C.P. 3453).

The Cabinet had also appointed a Sub-Committee, of which he was Chairman, to consider the question of the Military Forces and measures required to deal with the situation likely to arise in the event of a breakdown of the negotiations with the Egyptian Delegation, and all relevant matters such as control of water supply etc.

The Report of that Committee was now before the Cabinet (C.P.3458).

Lord Curzon went through, his paper paragraph by paragraph.

(i) Termination of Protectorate. This paragraph contained the general statement agreed to by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Imperial Conference. It embodies the announcement made to Parliament last March, that we proposed to substitute another relationship with Egypt in place of the Protectorate.

(ii) Military Dispositions. In Coluun (a) Military requirements were stated in a general form without definitely specifying the distribution and numbers of the forces to be retained. He proposed to make no change in the numbers and dispositions of the troops at present but, after
after a year, if the country were tranquil he proposedthat we should consider the possibility of withdrawingthe Cairo Garrison to Abassia and      the Ale:candriaGarrison to iltxstapha Barracks and of disposing theremainder of the forces in the triangle formed by port said, Zaga-zig  and Suez.   Lord Allenby was preparedto carry out Such an arrangement though he did not like it.   That   disposition i&quot;as endorsed as reasonable and safe by all our Advisers in Egypt.(iii) Foreign Relations.   The line taken at theImperial Conference was th.it the foreign relations should remain in our hands.   His discusoion with the egyptians showed however that it &apos;^as impossible toarrive at an agreement on that baSis.   The delegates had pointed out that the dangers of intrigues wouldnot be increased by Egyptian representation inforeign countries, for intrigues could be carried ohin Cairo under existing conditions and by Unofficialrepresentatives in foreign capitals.   Lord Allenbyhad agreed to Egyptian representation in foreign capitals and he had also agreed that his title shouldbe altered to ambassador.Lord Curzon thought that a concession could bemade in this matter as shewn in column (b) which provides for the supervision of foreign policy inEgypt by the British Ambassador.   The Egyptianswanted to have a voice in the negotiations on theabolition of the capitulations.   He would not grantthem power to block the treaties, but we might agreeto confer with the Egyptians in regard to the Treatiesbefore they are made.(iv) Employment /
(iv) Employment of foreign Officers *     He proposedto adhere to what had already been agreed upon asregards the employment of foreign Officers0(v) Finanoia 1 Administrationc     He proposed nochanges in coltvmn (a)e     It was proposed that theFinancial Adviser should have access to papers in orderthat he might know what was going on, but he should not interfere unless to prevent impracticable proposals whichwould have disastrous resultsc(vi) Judicial Administrationo   He proposed nochange In column (aj*     It was essential that we should maintain the supervision over the Judicial administration in order to prevent scandals and abuses which would inviteforeign interferences(vii) Soudan    He proposed to adhere to the arrange-ment in column (a)0     Egypt7s only interest in theSoudan was the water supply and we had agreed to set up aWater Conservancy Board on which they would be represented;,(viii) Suez Canal,.    He had proposed to retain theclause dealing with the extension of the Suez Canalconcession but Lord Inchoape had informed him yesterdaythat he considered the retention of the clause unnecessary,as many opportunities will occur for bringing pressure to bear on Egypt to secure its renewals     The egyptian delegation are strongly opposed to the inclusion of thisclause;    it excited their suspicions and they rememberedthat Boutros Fasha&apos;s assassination was connected with the proposals for the extension of the concession9    Inthese circumstances he was disposed to consent to itsomissions(x)   Retirement and compensation for Officials^   Hehad provided for securing fair compensation for our officials on retirement or dismissal from the Egyptian/Service
Service.(xi)   Protection of Minorities.     He had made provision in column (b) for the Protection of Minorities.     the delegates accepted these proposals.To summarise the positions   no reduction of our forces was proposed at present.     It was considered that theywould be adequate if no disturbance occurred*     Ultimatelythe bulk of the troops would be kept in the neighbourhoodof tho Canal Zone for the protection of the canal whichwas the main object of our presence in Egypt.    the external protection of Egypt would be effected by the Navy.The principle was that we should exorcise general super-vision rather than control the administration.     If wewithdraw our troops now the administration would probablycollapse, foreign interference would be Inevitable and weshould be called upon later to use sterner measures whichwould be much more expensive than the present garrison.He put forward the above proposals with reluctance and only because his hands had been forced by the publication ofthe Milner Report.    He believed that the offer which he proposed to males to the Egyptian Delegation, if theCabinet approved, would be refused, but he wanted to puthimself in the position in which the Government could show to the world that we had made the Egyptian Delegatesa generous offer.     The Cabinet must realise what wouldbe the effect of refusing any concession.     Egypt is nowquiet but is anxiously awaiting future developments.     the egyptians feel that Independence is almost within theirgrasp.     If they fall to obtain it their disappointmentwill be bitter and the country will unite against us.     Wecan no doubt provide a sufficient force to prevent ageneral/
general rising but there would no doubt bo violenoeand assassinations and he feared a complete breakdown of the administration caused by a uvriversal strike and the withdrawal of Government, offioials from their offices.     The ::illv:,.ry advioe given to his Committeewas that in the event of an insurrection and of theEgyptian army turning against us a reinforcement of24 battalions would be necessary.   If we kept thocountry outwardly tranquil by means of a large forceit is probable that a spirit of national hatredagainst us would grow up0   The population would besullon and dangerous and at some future date a BritishGovernment will either give away our position inEgypt altogether or annes the country,,   The Governmenthad rejected tho idea of annexation at the beginningof the war and he was still opposed to annexationwhich would have a very bad effect upon the Easternraces and on public opinion in the world which wouldnot support such action.His position was a very difficult one   He was opposed to Lord Milneir1 a proposals but his handshaving been forced he was anxious to make what was apparently a generous offer and he asked to be allowedto offer to Adly Pasha a Convention based uponcolumn (b) of his paper.    If Adly Pasha refused thatoffer we should publish its terms to the World and we   -should proceed to put in force as many of theseproposals as would be practicable aStrong objection was expressed to granting anyo onceS3ion in addition to those agreed to at the ImperialConference.     The Cabinet were reminded that we had announced the Protectorate for Egypt and obtained the assent ofaevoral of the Powers. Lord miner1 a proposals yieldedeverything
I-evorything and unfortunately they were published andso had compromised the Cabinets,   The Government had withgreat reluctance agreed to the foreign Seoretary negotiating with an Egyptian Delegation on a basis of the proposals in column (a).   1&apos;jxese proposals were regarded by theImperial Conference as an extreme concession, and it was feltthat they involved a surrender on our part on the morrow ofa great victory^   The further concessions now proposed had notoven the merit that the?-would be accepted.     The removal&apos; were of the troops, v;hioh&apos;/ths sole protection of foreignersand British residents in the country, might have a disaterous efect in the East.   Even tho concessions proposed to begranted in column (a) would lead to a olearanoe of men whohad made Egypt and the administration of the country wouldbreak down and the burden of its re-establishment would fall upon uSoTEH KlIMB J-HBI3ICBE stated that Lord curzon had had  -thrust upon Mm the most invidious and difficult task.He had found himself committed to proposals which he did not approve and he had been trying to extricatethe Government from the difficult position in which it had beenplaced.     He had had a conversation with Adly Pasha-ho was almost in despair about the position.   Adlygave no indication that he would accept Lord curzon*sproposals.     The Prime Minister considered it was almost impossible for us to negotiate with the Egyptiansso long as iiaghlul was making a progress through the countryand denouncing the british Government.   Under such obndi-tions it was almost impossible to grant concessions.i&apos;he situation would be greatly eased If 2aghlul wsradisposed of.   Zaghluls3 activities had create-&apos; a varybad atmosphere in the House of Commons which regardsZaghlul a3 the representative of Egyptian nationalism.He
He did not. believe the Government could carry any settlement except on the lines of the Sjbatus gupthrough the House of Goran q,..s in existing conditions.It was desirable to plaj- tfor time if that were practicable.     A disoussion on the negotiations in theouse would be necessary.     He would like to take stepsto deal with Zaghlttl v;hose recent proceedings had madeopinion in England hostile to any concessions.   AfterZaghlul had been dealt with it would be possible to returnto negotiations in a more favourable atmosphere.The 3abinet agreedTo adjourn the discussion in order to enablethe &quot;rime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor foreign -affairs to confer on the matter in thelight of the above discussion00
^^ntoXiO&apos; (7)   The Cabinet, had under consideration an Extract from!ono*^^14&apos;S &quot; ti^42nd Draft Mlnutes of the UnemplxryTnent-Committee(C .P.34F69) relative to -the proposals made by Lord Ashfield,on behalf of the Undejpgound Railway Companies to under-take various extension works provided certain facilities and help wore granted to him by the Government.The Cabinet were informed that the Ministry ofTransport was in favour of the proposals as were theLondon Members of Parliament subject to certain safe-guards which Lord Ashfield was ready to accept.Generally speaking the public press had supported thescheme and there was reason to believe that the LabourParty would also support the proposals in as much asthey would undoubtedly -provlde^substantial employment.On the other hand it was strongly represented thatallowedLord Ashfield&apos;s request to be    /   to createjWhat wouldin effect be a monopoly, was bound to excite very strong opposition both inside and outside Parliament and thatIt would be practically out of the question to carry thenecessary legislation through Parliament even assuming that Parliamentary time was available.- It was agreed(1) That Lord Ashfield&apos;s proposals for thecreation of a quasi monopoly of london transport should&quot;Be rejected and thatno Bill on the subject should be pre-pared as suggested by the UnemploymentCommittee.(2) That the Ministry of Transport in oon-veylng the Cabinet decision to LordAshfield should make every effort to persuade him to proceed with his pro-posed extensions on the clear under-standing that no scheme Involving a tx*irf-fic monopoly could be entertained.
ij^OYMENT,ft forI :i to re^./e Uh&quot;pymont c(8)    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinistry of Health (C ,.Pc540?) on the subject of Loans for works to relieve Unemployment in which it was pointed outthat in certain cases local authorities had been, unableto undertake unemployment relief works because they eithercould not borrow the money at all or could only borrow iton ruinous terms*     The Memorandum proposed that in thekind of caseS to which reference was made the Public WorksLoan Commissioners should be requested to lend thenecessary capital monies to the local authorities., theCommissioners being provided with funds for the purpose.The Cabinet were informed by the Chancellor of theExchequer that if adopted the proposals would result inthe larger authorities obtaining all the available money.It must be remembered that the money which can be devotedfor these purposes is strictly limited and that the present arrangements had been adopted so as to provide so far aspossible that those authorities which by reason of large population ought to be able to carry their liabilitieswithout State assistance should not have ready access tomoney in the hands of the Public Works Loan Commissioners,The Cabinet agreedThat the proposals contained in the concluding paragraph of the Ministerof Hsalttrs Memorandum C.Pa540&apos;f shouldnot be adopted but that the treasury and Ministry of Health should furtherexamine the question to see whetherthe difficulties referred to in theMemorandum could be satisfactorilydisposed of in some other way8
GHANISTAN.        (9)    The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that in a recent telegram received from theViceroy, Lard Reading had again \irged that theBritish Government should not make the full disclosby the Amir of the Bolshevic Treaty a conditionsine qua 355(3n   of their assent to the proposedAfghanistan Treaty.The view was generally expressed that nofurther concessions should be made to the Amirand it was agreedThat 4he Secretary af State for india had the full support of the Cabinetin differing from the Viceroy on thequestion of the disclosure by the Amirof the Bolshevic Treaty.2f Whitehall Gardens,, Sc&quot;fuc3rd November, 1921*
