(1)With reference to Cabinet 73 (21), Conclusion 1, the Cabinet had before them Mr. de Valera&apos;s reply dated August 30th, 1921, to the Prime Minister&apos;s letter dated August 26th, 1921 (Paper C.P.3278 - Revise), together with a draft reply which had been prepared by the Prime Minister after consultation with these of his colleagues who were available in Scotland.

The Prime Minister stated that he had that morning had an opportunity of discussing the situation with the King, who had expressed anxiety that the Government&apos;s reply should not be in the nature of an ultimatum if a character likely to precipitate hostilities.

There was general agreement as to the intractable character of Mr. de Valera&apos;s latest reply, and as to the difficulty of advancing matters by correspondence. Public opinion, it was held, was also becoming tired of the prolonged exchange of letters. It was recognised that the Government&apos;s policy commanded the assent of the civilised world outside Ireland, and that, it was important that nothing should be done to forfeit this universal support. Two courses appeared to be open to the Cabinet. One was to summon Mr. de Valera to a conditional Conference on the basis of allegiance to the Crown and membership of the British Empire. If he refused this invitation the responsibility for the rupture of negotiations would rest with him. The other course was to invite Mr. de Valera and other representatives of Dail Eireann to resume the unconditional conferences which had been held with the Prime Minister. In this letter invitation the
f British torms should only bo briefly referred to and not specifically ra-stated.  -The Cabinet considered various draft replieswhich gave effect to these alternative courses.In the discussion which ensued, opinion msalmost equally divided on the advantages of each course.On th; one hand it was urged that Mr; do Vnlora tjouldnot publicly accept an invitation to a conditionalConference, owiag to the pressure from extremists inIreland and in the United States   while thore was 3omeevidence to show that if the Conference did in facttake place he would bo able tb make vital concessionsat the Conference Table which he would not publiclyavow in advance in writing.     On the other hand itwas maintained that an unconditional invitation wouldlower British authority and prestige not only in Irelandbut in India and on the Continent &amp; . Europe.       Further,if the Conference were hold without the prior acceptanceof allegiance to the Crown and membership of the Empireby Mr, do Valora, ho would postpone such acceptanceuntil ho had first ascertained the other British conditions,for example^ with regard to Ulster, and in particularour policy with regard to tho Counties of Tyrone andFermanagh;     If the Conference broke down on the determination of the Government to retain these twoCounties within the area of the Northern Parliament,tho issue thus raised would be one far less favourable to us than if tho break came on the refusal to acceptBritish Sovereignty and Empire.     *t would not be possibleto unite public opinion in support of tho maintenance ofthe two Counties within political Ulster, whereas loyalty to the Throne and the Empire would command universalacceptance.2
Tho Secretary of State for India, who asked thathis views should he recorded, contended that a Conferoncomight yield everything tho Government wanted^ whilean attempt to impose preliminary conditions mightprevent the holding of any Conference and so achievenothing but the renewal of war.     War could not thenbe renewed on the refusal of Sinn Fein to Acceptmembership of the British Emplro, but on the refusal of Sinn Fein to accept membership of the British Empiroas a condition precedent to negotiations.     Hesuggested that tho Conference should bo, as originally proposed, unconditional, and that the reply to Mr. de valera should fix a date for the holding of auch aConference, and a statement that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had defined its position so clearly in previous letters as to make further discussionsuperfluous.At 1 o&apos;clock the Cabinet adjourned forluncheon and ro-as-aomulod at lo45, inorder to consider a fx&apos;esh draft reply which had been prepared in oho light ofthe discussion which had taken place.Mr.. Copo* Assistant Undersecretary for Ireland,at the request of the Cabinet, gave his views upon theprobable reception of tho draft reply &amp;n Ireland.After various amendments td this draft reply, itwas finally agreed to in the form set forth in thoAppondix, (Paper No. CP.3290), and was handed, at the close of the Meeting, by tho Prime Minister to Mr. Barton,the Sinn Fein Envoy, with an understanding that itshould not be given to tho Press before 4 p,m. onThursday.

UNIfe.PLOyi.lEUT.   [3)   V/lth reference to Cabinet (71) (21) Conclusion16, the Cabinet had before then a memorandum by theHinister of Labour dealing with the Unemployment situation(Paper CBU,174) and a letter addressed to the PrimeItlniater by the London Labour Party dealing with Unemploy-ment and the Rates (Paper CP.5281).The Cabinet were reminded of the serious positionin tho poorer quarters in London and in a number of importantprovincial centres where there were not only many thousandsunemployed but also thousands who had exhausted thoir out-of-work benefito     There were Indications that in some areas the situation was getting out of hand and beyond the powerof the Poor Law authorities to deal with effectively.   Inaccordance with the previous decision of the Cabinet theSecretary for Scotland had issued a Circular to the Scottish.Poor Law Authorities urging a more generous provision of out-door reliefj with a view to assimilating the conditionsin England and Scotland^ but race-payers wore protesting against this recommendation as imposing ar intolerableburden upon then.     The alternative suggestion vras thereforeput forward of an Exchequer Grant not exceeding  10,000,000,to be administered by a special Committee or by Lord St.Davlde6 Comnittee and assigned to Local Authorities forapproved work on the basis of pound for pound.It was stated that Poor Law Authorities w- contraryto the impression conveyed by newspapers - were not in faotfreshbeing driven, except in a few cases, to raisfen^/Loans,nor were they likely to experience serious difficulty in raising such loanse     It wa3 suggested that assistance could best be rendered to them by asking the Exchequer tobear a part of the interest charges on any fresh loans foundnecessary for the relief of unemployment.-5-
There was general agreement(a) that it was desirable to concentrate relief workin the hands of the -Ministry of Health acting in close consultation with the Ministry of Labour:fb) that the type of work to be assisted should beextended to schemes other than roads and of a much widercharacter.Emphasis was laid on the great extent to which thecharacter of the Unemployment Insurance Act had been modified by the Government by the grant of uncovenantedbenefits to ex-Service Men and the grant more than oncoof additional weeks of benefits     The result had been to lead large numbers of the unemployed to lean unduly onthis form of State assistance rather than accept work at such reduced rates of wages as employers could afford to pay.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That a Meeting of the Unemployment Committeeshould be held in London on Friday next to review the whole position, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(b) That the Committee should have full powersto act on behalf of the Cabinet,, and should in particular frame measures to deal withthe more distressed areas through anextension of Poor Relief, and the assimi-lation of the policy in Scotland to that ofEnglandj the tightening up of the admlnis-tration of existing schemes for the relief of unemployment, and the extension.of municipal schemes with a work tests(c) That the question of further financialassistance should bo discussed by thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of theExchequer before the Meeting of theCommittee of Friday.

i APPENDIX,CP,5390.REPLY TO MR. DE YALERA:SLETTER OB1 AUGUST 30 th. 1921,Sir,His Majesty1s Government have considered your letter ofAugust 30th, obocl have to make. the - following observations, upon it.The priJaaiple ,ef government by oonso..?n of the governed is   .the foundation of British constitutional development, bat wecannot accept as a basis of ,practical conference an interpretation of that principle which would commit us to.any demands which youmight present, - even to the extent of set king up a republic andrepudiating the Otota.     You iaust be aware that conference on sucha basis is impossible.   So applied, the principle.of government by consent of the governed would undermine the fabriu of everydemocratic State and drive the civilised world back into tribalism.On, the other hand, we have inviteu you to discuss our pro-posals on their merits, in order that you may have no doubt as tothe scope and sincerity of our intentions.    It would be open toyou in such a conference, to raise the subject of guarantees onany points in which you may consider Irish freedom prejudiced byrthese proposals.His Majosty8s Government are loth to believe that you willinsist upon rejecting their proposals without examining them in conference.    To uecline to discuss a settlement which would bestowupon the Irish people the fullest freedom of national developmentwithin the Empire can only mean that you repudiate all allegianoeto the Crown, and all membership of the British Commonwealth.If we were to draw this inference from your letter, then fui\therdiscussion between us could serve no useful purpose, and all- * : -       /conference. .\.*...
t I- .  . .conference would be in vain.   If, however., we are mistaken in thisinference, as we still hope; and if your real objection to our proposals is that they offer Ireland less than the liberty whichwe have described, that objection can be explored at a Conference.You will agree that this correspondence- has lasted long enough.     His Majesty* s Government must therefore ask for a definitereply as t6 whether you are prepared to enter a Conference toascertain how the association of Ireland with the community of nat-ions known as the British Empire can best be reconciled with Irishnational aspirations.   If, as we hope, your answer is in the affirmative,, I suggest that the Conference should meet at Invernesson the 20th instant.I am,Sir,Yours faithfully,(Swd)      D. L10YD GEORGE.Own Hall,I INVERNESS,H9ptsinbear-7th. 1931.
