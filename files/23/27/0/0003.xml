HE WASHTWQ^O^ tl) With reference to Cabinet 68 121)4 Appendix I..U),, theXMFRRENCE OWLIS ARMAMENT. &quot;&quot;Seci^rtary&apos; of State for Foreign Affairs laid stress on the   .importance of an early decision in regard to British repre-sentation at the forthcoming . iht e national Conference atWashington on Disarmament.In view of the unavoidable absence of the Secretary ofState, for the Colonies, Who was closely concerned in thisQuestion, the Cabinet agreed  To postpone consideration of the&quot;subjectuntil the following day.
C2) The Prime Minis-ter ^called the attention of his col-Xe&amp;colleagues to the large degree of publicity which had been givento the discussions of the Cabinet Coramittoe, and at Gairloch^on the subject of Unemployment.    The Press had publishedparticulars of sckemes under consideration by the CabinetCommittee before the remainder of the Cabinet were cognizantof them.The Cabinet agreed  .That there should be complete reticencein regard Either to decisions or schemesrelating to unemployment until the wholepolicy could be announced in Parliament.
BMPDOYWHWIS,       (55) ^tti-T^OTenoe^^:-OjrM.npt 75, Conclusion 1, the Cabinetresumed the discussion on the question of Unemployment, on thebasis of the proceedings of the Cabinet Committee on Uncmploy-ment, so far as they had reached.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that thesame morning he and Mr Chamberlain had met the CabinetCommittee on Unemployment and had taken stock of the whole situation in regard to this problem.   At the end of this dis-cussion a Drafting Committee had been convened,under theChairmanship of the President 0^ the Board of Trade, to form-ulate the conclusions which had been reached for dealing witha situation in regard to unemployment which the prime Ministerdescribed as &quot;unprecedented^..The Conclusions as formulated by the. Drafting Commit-Revisetee were then handed round (-Paper CP.-337^ Csee Appendix I) .The attention of the Cabinet was also drawn to theproposals of the Economic and Financial Experts who aceompan-ied Mr Hilton Young to visit the Prime Minister at Gairloch,and whose report (Paper CP.-3363) (see Appendix II)    had formed the basis of the discussions between the Prime Minister,the Lord Privy Seal and the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment.The Cabinet agreed  -(.a) To approve in principle the report of theConference between the.Prime Minister, theLord Privy Seal and the Cabinet Committeeon Unemployment iPaper CP.-3371 - Appendix Ito these Conclusions):Cb) To refer the report to the Cabinet Committeeon Unemployment to work out in detail:Cc) To ask the Cabinet Committee on Unemploy-ment to consider methods of enlisting the active interest and co-operation of theUnemployed themselves in relief work, soas to diminish as far as possible thedeleterious effect of such work:
(d) To ask the President of the Board of Trade toreport to the Cabihet Committee on Unemploymenton the suggestion that the. railway systems of the&quot;Succession States1&apos; in South Eastern Europe mightbe re-organised..byy and. their&apos; rolling stockreplenished from, this country:(e) That the Secretary of State for India shouldbe added to the Cabinet Committee on Unemployments(See f following. Conclusion)o
(4) The attention of the Cabinet was called to the possi-m INDIANAILWAYS.        bility of large orders being placed by the Indian... kivernmentto make good the deficiencies on the Indian^railways ,The Secretary of State for India indicated that oneof the principal obstacles of the Indian Government in placing orders was the difficulty of Securing long creditsat reasonable rates of interest.   He thought it possiblethat if this difficulty could be surmounted, through theinstrumentality of the proposals now before the Cabinet, orotherwise, it very large orders might be placed.The Secretary of State for Indiaundertook to furnish a report onthe subject at the earliest possible moment.
(5)   The President, of the Board of Educationinformed the Cabinet that Local Education authorities were probably, in a position^ if authorised by his department, to spend large sums oh. building, painting,and repairs. .   Proposals of Local Authorities to theamount of  1*300,000 had already been rejected by theDepartment on financial groundsThe Secretary of State for War stated thathis Department could place a good deal of work ifmoney were available.The question was also raised as to whether,,in the interests of unemployment, work en the fourcapital ships approved for this year% shipbuilding programme could be hastened, though the First Lordindicated that for material reasons the Admiraltymight not be able to spend more money than they hadtaken this year* .  He would, however, explore thepossibilityaThe general view of the Gabinet was that work of the above nature should only be undertakenif it would relieve Unemployment.     Building, forexample, should not be approved, as there is littleunemployment in.the building trade, and it is undesir.able to take action calculated to force up prices:but painting and whitewashing might be considered,as painters were to a great extent unemployed, andwhitewashing could be carried out by unskilled labour the Cabinet invited the Cabinet .Committee on Unemployment to placethemselves In. communication with thePresident of the Board of education and the Secretary of State for War,and to ask ail Government departments to submit proposals of work likely iorelieve unemployment *

The Prime Minister pointed out the probability thatthe proceedings of the Conference^ involving many conpli-cated questions of detail, might be considerably prolonged.It was clear that he himself and the Lord Privy Seal couldnot sit from day to day for weeks discussing questions of detail.   The Conference would probably have to form manySub-Committees on such subjects as the Truce which wouldhave to be taken up at the outset), finance, trade&apos;, etc.,and constitutional matters,, and some questions might with advantage be remitted to individuals.    For these detailed discussions It might be necessary to call on members of theCabinet over and above the representatives at the fullConference.The Cabinet agreed ---(a) To invite the Prime Minister to draw upthe list of Ministers to represent theBritish Government at the Conference, and endorsed the following list submitted byhim:-The Prime Minister,The Loid Privy Seal,The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for   ar,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Chief Secretary for Ireland.The Attorney-General to be amember whenever constitutional,questions were raised.i.b) That, in view of the large amount of dis-cusoion that had been devoted by the Cabinetto this question, no specific instructionsneed be given to the British representatives.The Cabinet would^ of course, be consulted

APPENDIX I to Cabinet 76 (21).

UNEMPLOYMENT.



SECRET. C.P.3371.Revise



The Cabinet Committee on Unemployment which met this morning under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister: the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Exchequer being present, make the following Report to the Cabinet :-

(1) It is estimated that there will be 1½ million men, women and young persons, out of work during the winter. The reports of experts, though not altogether unhopeful, do not  indicate any likelihood of a restoration of trade to anything approaching the normal within less than two years. During this period Government action will be required in relief of unemployment.

(2) Mere measures of maintenance are, from every point of view, the least satisfactory.    They constitute the most demoralising form of assistance to the unemployed, and they contribute nothing towards the solution of the permanent, as distinct from the temporary, unemployment problem.

(3) Relief works are only slightly better than maintenance. They are mostly of little economic value, they draw men to occupations to which they are ?, and in which their work is therefore uneconomical.

(4) Nevertheless, both maintenance and relief works will be inevitable during the present acute emergency, and must be provided to deal with the considerable margin which will be left unabsorbed by any other scheme.

(5) Simultaneously, however, with such maintenance and relief work as are unavoidable, as much as possible should be done to stimulate productive employment. The most hopeful schemes in this direction are the following:-


2la) The Tsswposals of the experts who aceom-panied the Financial Secretary of theTreasury to Gairloch (as set out in C.P.-55363) for enabling capital works to beundertaken in this country or outsideit by means of State assistance^ whichcould not otherwise be undertaken at thepresent time, on the understanding thatthe money is utilised to provide employ-is ent in this countryoIt was explained by the President ofthe Board of Trade that, from conversa-tions which he had recently had withbankers, he believed that a guarantee bythe Government of the interest on loansrequired to finance new works and expendi-ture on railways and similar-undertakings in India, in the Colonies and South America,would lead to the immediate placing of large orders in this country.   The bankers believedthat the saving of Interest which would be gained by the Government guarantee would bea sufficient inducement to the undertakersto pay today&apos;s prices instead of waiting fora further fall in the market.(b) The relation of the Export Credit Schemeto the foregoing will require further con-sideration.     Doubt was expressed as to howfa? any extension of the present scheme would contribute substantially to relieve the present problem.
It is further recommended:-

(6) That a Committee be set up to consider and advise the Cabinet as to the practicability and expediency for raising from those persons who are so fortunate as to be employed, a special compulsory distress levy of 2d. a week from the State, for the purpose of forming a Distress Fund providing for wives and children for whom the Unemployment Benefit of 15/- a week for the husband will not make sufficient provision. The Committee to advise as to the best manner in which the Fund should be spent, i.e., by grants in money or in kind through the agency of the Local Authorities, bearing in mind that grants of relief in kind would probably be most economical. The Committee to consist of:-

The Secretary for Scotland (In the Chair)

Mr. McCurdy,

Sir W. Mitchell-Thomson,

Mr. Herbert Lewis,

Sir Montague Barlow.

(7) That the contribution of the State, under the scheme approved by the Cabinet Unemployment Committee (See Appendix) for the assistance of Local Authorities in financing schemes of relief works, should be increased from 50 per cent of interest and ? for half the period of the municipal loan raised for the purpose, to 65 per cent.

(8) That the rate of wages on any relief works provided must be appreciably lower than the standard rate of wages for work of the same character. The Ministry of Health circular has stipulated a rate of 75 per cent of the standard.


(9) The great- strain tlirown ,o&amp;. Boor I&amp;w* f%JOBaoo owing tocessation of benefits under the National InsAxrance Actand the large accretion of claimants to relief on PoorRates will lead to a sexlous crisis in local finance,and the Un^gl^yment Committee, feel conYinced that some formof assistance to Poor Law SfU&amp;rdians in necessitous areas is likely to become unavoidable.     It is considered thatthe best form will be loan rather than grant, and theMinistry of Health and Treasury are engaged in determining the proper-safeguards for such loans.     It is at presentimpossible to determine-the -amount of money which will-berequired for such purpose.     The greateet-caution will berequired to\prevent an undue burden being thrown by theLocal Authorities on the State
10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to the Unemployment Committee to provide £10,000,000 to cover, inter alia, expenditure on approved schemes of the following types:

(i) Works financed by the Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee

(ii) Schemes of Land Drainage.

(iii) Roads.

(iv) Public Utility Works, e.g. hydro-electric development, light railways, electrification schemes.

(v) Assistance to Poor Law Guardians in necessitous areas.

but pointed out that separate provision would be required for the scheme proposed under (5).

The Committee were also of opinion that:-

11. Schemes of afforestation do not offer suitable means for relieving unemployment, in view of the small number of men employable and the long period required for the work to  become productive.

12. The situation of national finance is so serious as to require the most careful consideration of the effect of any scheme proposed in adding to the Floating Debt, and in reducing the funds available for investment in Government loans for conversion, or other purposes.

13. It is useless to disguise the fact that profound unrest and bitter feeling are growing among the unemployed throughout the country. A very large proportion of the unemployed to-day are not the usual type of unskilled or work-shy men, but are largely people who all  their lives have been used to regular work at good wages and many of whom are still making every effort/

APPENDIX II to CABINET/ 76(21)CABINET.uTffiKPLOYMENT.Proposals, of Commander Eilton Young&apos;s.C8T SECRET..       Committee suprnittea to the Prime Minister : ; at. Gairioch, October 2nd, 1921a  ! &quot;a3g63--l.     The fundamental causes of unemployment are of a world-wide character, namely (a) iiapoTeriahment and dislocation ofthe means of production consequent directly or indirectly uponthe wars (b) the impediments in the way of new enterprisecaused by ^KJlitijcal- and economic instability.   In so far asthe remedy for these depends upon action in the Intepastional^sphere- we have not attempted to deal with themc2e     The most important immediate influence in Great britain is the relatively high cost of production caused mainly by thehigher ratesox wages03.     There is no short out for avoiding the necessary processof adjusting costs to those of our competitors;.   Readjustmenthowever may be e:cpedited by more widespread miderstandlng of/the economic situation, and it is of fundamental importance that no scheme of relief should hinder this process.4*     It is inevitable that during this process of readjust-ment a proportion of unemployed must, be supported by doles- orrelief.5*    Effort, however, should be concentrated In keeping as many workers as possible engaged in their normal industries by the encouragement of fresh orders.6.-    This cannot be done by any general extension of credit facilities but we think that means may be found by which state assistance could enable works, to be undertaken which otherwise would not be done at the present time. Such assistance wouldgive
give by its initiative an iinpulso towards industrial rwival.If and so far as tho successful working of the scheme isimpeded by the high cost of production it will servo as a&apos; useful illustration of the immsdiata causes Sj&amp;f unemployment.fOur proposals for this are- as follows:-7.        A Committee consisting of a small number (say five)of representatives of industry, labour and finance should be &apos;established with authority to assist, within the limits of thefinancial powers conferred upon thorn, (1) the pr&amp;motion athomo of capital works (including undertakings ancillary orincidental thereto) that will bo of ultimate benefit to %he,nation and will provide employment, such works to bo under-taken by local authorities, public utility companies or private enterprises;    (S) the placing of orders in this marketfrom the British Empire and foreign countries for works&apos; of asimilar nature.     In the case of foreign countries tho scheme could be workod in conjunction with tho Tor Meulon project.f;in all cases such assistance would, when desirable, take theform pf a guarantee.8.       Tho Committee shall bo instructed to reject any schemewhen in their opinion tho cost of production cither as a whole.or in any detail is unreasonably high.9,       Tho Committee should satisfy themselves in every case that there ars adequate reasons which justify State assistance and that the schema cannot reasonably bo financed by privatesntorpriso.10.       In tha case of all Applications and especially those\&apos; . -     -   . . .    . . \of private concerns assistance shall only be granted by theCommittoo upon terms which they are satisfied will ultimatelysecure adequate benefit to the public.To....

CP. 3331) had producedfor the first time quite a different tone of answerfrom the Sinn Pein leader and It would appear thatde Valera was losing his public and dividing his followers.    He (the Prime kinister) had talked veryplainly to the two Sinn Pein couriers who came toGairloeh^ana they had both shewed great alarm whenit was suggested to them, there would be no conference.The Prime Minister j continuing, said that it wasa mistake to assume, supposing a conference did. take-place, that it would settle the question.   He there-fore urged that the Government should not put itselfinto a false position.    On de Valerals present claimit was impossible to proceed without grave danger.It was stated by some that de Valera had $ot himselfinto a tangle by inserting in his reply the unwiseparagraph about a sovereign and independent state,and that he should be helped out of his position.He (the Prime hinister) was all in favour of doing this if it was merely a question of saving de Valera&apos;sface, but if the sovereign and independent state claim was a reality it was better to fight the matter outnow.
The Conference then^^-txoial^r^d^ev^r^^ draftreplies which had been put forward.It ?/as urged that if it was possible to enter aconference without the risk of recognising an irish republic all would be well, and if the conference failedthe Republlo would never have been recognised by us.it was to be remembered however that the public   had setth^ir heart on a conference and if there was a breakwithout any meeting having taken place it would be saidthat a conference might have saved the situation.General support might not be given to the Government ifit was to break with the Sinn Peiner3 because they wouldnot say they accepted the Crown and membership of theEmpire, as a preliminary to a Conference,Soms discussion then followed on the suggested aban-donment of the Inverness conference and the proposed meeting to be held in London on October 4th,     The PrimeMinister said this course would have the advantage of starting negotiations on a new basis.   The correspondencewhich had taken place with de Valera since the InveraossCabinet did not form a suitable basis for negotiations.Further, the suggestion of a new conference would be ofundoubted assistance to de Valera, inasmuch as it wouldfree him from the position he had taken up during thelast fortnight.After further-discuss!on the Conference agreedprovisionally on the draft set out in Annex I,The Conference then adjourned until thefellowlng morningoGairioChSeptember 21st 1921

* Ite^ELOYMEHT.    (1)    With reference to Cabinet 75 ( 1) Conclusion 1,the Conference considered the question of unemploy-ment.     The Minister of Labour gave detailed figuresregarding unemployment in London and other parts ofthe country, estimating that during the coming winterthe number of unemployed would amount to one and aguarter to one and a half million.    The Poor LawGuardians were now finding it difficult to render assistance and benefits from Trade Unions had entire--ly given out.    The Unemploymenfe Benefit would not come into force again until the .3rd November and-immediate steps were necessary to meet the situationbetween now and that date.   Lr Macnamara said thathe did not think the amount of assistance rendered by the Government to alleviate unemployment was generally recognised.    Since the Armistice until31st March 19SI, 62 millions had been paid out andfrom November until the present date  44 millions.Three-quarters of the latter sum had Tbeen contributed by employers and employed under the Act.    LrMacnamara, continuing, said that employing men onartificial work could really only touch the fringe ofthe problem.

1 Proposed With reference to Cabinet 70 (21) Conclusion 5 (IV)&quot;Treaty&quot;with - - - ; ... the Committee had under consideration the latest telegraphicFeisal,.  .-.correspondence which had passed between the Colonial Office&apos;.        and the High Commissioner in Mesopotamia In connection withthe accession of-the Emir&apos;. Feisal to the throne and also draft telegrams to the. High Commissioner-prepared&apos;bya Committee of legal advisers containing the terms of an announcement whichit was proposed Feisal should make on his accession and theterms of the proposed Treaty,.    .   - :The Secretary of State for. the Colonies pointed out thathe had just received Information from Mesopotamia that Feisalhad been elected by an overwhelming vote and he was most anxiousto make the-best use of.this favourable opportunity to placeFeisal on the throne and obtain from him a promise of satisfnc-.&quot;-&apos; &apos; &quot; tory relations&apos; for the future.  &apos; The High&apos;Commissioner -strongly-recommended., this course of action, but it appeared that theDraft Treaty&apos;was too rigid a document which might not find favourwith King Feisal j-.. the League. of Nations might also take exception to its terms on the grounds that it did not conveya sufficient, measure of autonomy. &apos;\     ...;.  Attention was called to the terms of the draft announcement-.,.*&apos;&apos;    which&apos;-it&apos; WFS proposed Feisal . should -make on- his - accessionwhich commonced with the following phrase &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided to recognise me as sovereign of theState of Iraq&quot; and it was pointed out that It was doubtful if ,such a statement could&apos;be made.     Although the Mandate for- . . ,        Mesopotamia had been conferred on Great Britain, the Leagueof Nations&apos; had not yet confirmed its terms ; : in; addition theUnited Stateahad certain objections to raise in connectionwith Mandates and they would be still less likely to agree toa Treaty substituted for a Mandate not confirmed by the LeagueIt was also pointed out that it was doubtful if a MandatoryPower could elect a King for its mandated Territory and His.-1-
Majesty1 a Government had not allowed such action In the caseof Syria: if we now announced Feisal as King of Mesopotamiathe French would undoubtedly object.In reply to this ^t appeared that Feisal should saythat His Majesty&apos;s Government had recognised the overwhelmingvote of the people of the country j   and it was -w^de sir ablethat in his first speech from the throne no reference shouldbe made which could be quoted as a recognition of theauthority of the Mandatory Power.     It was accordinglyconsidered that in any speech delivered by Feisal on hisaccession reference should be made to the fact that HisMajesty^ Government recognised the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Mesopotamia but that otherwise   -Sir P. Cox should have wide desoretion in the actual termsof the speech.As regards the League of Nations a very good case couldundoubtedly be made^ and it could be pointed out that 3*?eatBritain was so anxious to act in accordance with the spiritof the Mandate and had made such rapid strides in the admin-istration of Mesopotamia that we were ready to set up anindependent Government the terms of the Treaty with whichvery closely corresponded ?i th the spirit of the Mandate,-Mr, Malkin stated that juridically the making of a treaty with Feisal was correct provided that it was made clear thatGreat Britain still considered herself responsible to theLeague of Nations for the good administration of Mesopotamia.Attention was drawn to the advantage of getting theCouncil of the League of Nations to accept the Treaty in lieu of the Mandate   but doubts were expressed if this would bepossible if the actual draft under consideration by theCommittee was despatched;   it appeared that the idea of atreaty would be more likely to prove acceptable to the Leagueif, instead of being shewn an actual draft Treaty, the Leaguewas consulted as to the lines, on tfilch it should be drawn up.
&quot;: Feisal&apos;1 s objectiona to ascending the throne with an undefino-status were then referred to and the danger of his refusing the throne at the last minute unless^he&apos;, fully-understood his exactposition vis a vis the; British Government.   - It was pointed outhow much he owed to the British- Government and that he &quot;must bemade to recognise the difficulties, of. that Government in makinga Treaty- with him when the League of Nations.had not confirmed the terms of -the Mandate.,   ....- . &apos;, Thesuggestion was then made that Feisal1s accession shouldtake, place as-arranged and that the Treaty should be drafted .....subsequently .and :it-was considered that this might be accomplishedif a telegram were immediately despatched assuring him that HisMajesty&apos;:a Government.desired to see him a real Sovereign but thathe could only be invested with such powers by us,through the Leaguof Nations,  and ,that he would then be recognised by the world&apos;generally as King. .; : That this action would be a lengthy one asthe League would have to.bo consulted, hence at present it wasonly desired to settle, the terms of. his declaration: to the HighCommissioner and his speech on accession and that the treaty would be drafted aftery/ards...After some further, discussion it was decided. ;-       -&apos;  - &apos;-:.&quot;&apos;   - -       ;-: (l) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies,should despatch to the High&apos; Commissioner. -for Mesopotamia.: a telegram on the lines suggested assuring Faisal of the good       &apos;   ,  .wishes of. His Ma Jesty&apos; s.. Government and giving an outline of the terms- of a. declaration he should, make to. t5r.ie.

41616/21.     PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to the High Commissioner of Mesopotamia.(Sent 1.30 p,m, 20th August, 1921).,Clear the line.Ho. 336.In reply.to your telegram Ho. 397-You should assure Feisal at once from me that there isno question of a change- of attitude on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      I fully appreciate Peisal&apos;s view and I&apos; am asanxious as you are that we should do everything we can tostrengthen him in the eyes of the people.      I,drafted, my -telegram Ho. 304 on the assumption that it would be difficult ifnot impossible to evade the necessity of the Organic.^aw.beingdrafted and passed in the first instance by the mandatory.Careful consideration has been given to the whole question whichwas referred by Cabinet to a Cabinet Committee including Mr..Pisher who is representative- of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton Council of League of Nations and Secretaries of. Statefor Foreign Affairs and India.,     On consulting ForeignOffice further we no?/ find that &quot;it is     possible, for us totake the definite position at once that we propose to.carry out our obligations under the mandate by treaty with Feisal.      It is therefore agreed that he should framethe Organic. La\v in consultation with the native authoritiesbut before it: is finally-passed its provisions must be approved by you as we shall have to take responsibilityfor it towards.other Powers.      It is clearly necessaryin the same, way that we should have full guarantee thatthe treaty in its final form will enable us to fulfil our international obligations, and also that we will be pro-tected in certain, important questions of finance. ^ Itwill
 will be sufficient if Feisal before his accession gives you a solemn undertaking, preferably in writing, on these two points and from the tenor of your telegrams I have no doubt that he wi11 readily agree to do so. He should make some such declaration as the following in the course of his speech from the throne: Begins (R) His Majesty&apos;s Government in faithful pursuance of the obligations upon which they have entered have decided to recognise me as King of the Independent State of Iraq, to which high office I have been called by the overwhelming vote of the people of the country. I have undertaken to enter into a Treaty with His Britannic Majesty, the object of which will be on the one hand formally to record such recognition, and on the other hand to make such provision as may be necessary to enable His Britannic Majesty to carry out the obligations which he has undertaken in respect of Iraq. My first step will be to frame in consultation with the High Commissioner and with the representatives of the people an Organic Law for Iraq, which will provide for a free democratic and representative constitution for the country and shall take account of the rights, interests, and wishes of all the populations. I have also undertaken that a judicial system shall be established in Iraq of a nature to safeguard the interests of foreigners and the legal rights connected with religious beliefs of certain communities. The constitution will ensure to all complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship, subject only to the maintenance, of public order and morals, and also that no discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants, of Iraq on the ground of race, religion or language.


language.     It, will, also ensure equality of treatment in commercial matters for foreign countries.      (Cease(R) Ends.)The following is the procedure which ibe pro-pose to adopt:-     We will explain to the Council of theLeague of Nations the manner in which we have hithertoexercised our.mandate,  arid; that we are convinced by thepolitical developments which have taken place, includingthe /overwhelming vote in. favour of - Feisal, thatMesopotamia has.advanced.so far.towards being able to stand alone that we are in a-position which enables us tocarry out our obligations to the League and foreign powers by means of a- treaty with him.     Invitation will begiven to the&apos;League :to. approve our action and to give us&apos;some Indication of the general lines.which they considerthe. Treaty should.follow. :    Possibly the:/ will agree thatit can satisfactorily be. left to Feisal himself to carryout.certain of the provisions which we have inserted inour draft mandate.&apos;;&apos;   Regarding others the responsibilitytowards the League and other Powers., must for some timeremain with us and Feisal will I am sure understand thatthis being ,-so the treaty must be such as will enable usto fulfil these obligations.     The question of the finalinclusion of predominantly Kurdish areas in the Kingdomof - Iraq is not yet decided and I agree that it isdesirable that Feisal should clearly understand this.
