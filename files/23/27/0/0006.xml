UNEMPLOYMENT

The Gairlech Scheme for the Revival of Trade.

(1) With reference to Cabinet 77 (21), Conclusion 6, the Cabinet had before them the Report of the Unemployment Committee (C.P.5408).

Discussion was concentrated at first on the extent of the liability to be accepted by the Government in connection with the Gairlech Scheme for the revival of trade (Section 3 of the Report), more particularly in the light of the Treasury&apos;s objections (C.U.274).

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, while stating that in principle he had always supported this scheme, explained the objections to the acceptance of large liabilities under it. He laid stress on the extreme difficulty of raising money for Government purposes at the present time when the City was loaded up with Government securities, and suspicious of Government expenditure. Moreover, he pointed out that the scheme must inevitably delay the operation of the normal economic forces by which alone could economic equilibrium be permanently established. On the other hand, the Cabinet was reminded that even though the scheme was adopted on a large scale, there would unfortunately be a large residue of employment for the operation of the ordinary economic force. The difference was emphasised between the allocation of sums to more doles, which was very repugnant for the financial and commercial world, and the guarantee of a much larger amount for the purpose of starting up trade, loading, it was hoped, to the placing of large orders. The Governor of the Bank of England was quoted as being strongly of opinion that the backing of the 
of the Government would not make tho differenceanticipated in the initiation of row enterprises,After further discussion, it was agreedThat the Pi-imo Minister should discuss with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Governor of theBank of England, the limits of thetotal sums to be guaranteed by the government for interest and sinkingfund on approved schemes.(2ho alternative proposal for theissuo of a loan to be called ths&quot;National and Empire Levclcpmcnt loan7&apos;was left over for consideration ata later dato.)
feiPSRIALDEVELOPMENT,Reparationsby Germany.(2)    On the subject of Imperial-X)evelopment(Section 33 para (e) of the Report of the Committeeon Unemployment^ THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THECOLONIES informed his colleagues that he was already in process of putting out loans of from 20 -.25millions on the credit of Crown Coloniesabout Qb%of which would be spent In the United KingdcmoThis expenditure was at present limited by the credit of the Grown Colonies In question, &quot;but ccu.ldbe substantially increased if the Imperial Governmentwould make further credit available*Yet a further plan for increasing this expenditure would be an adaptation of the plan proposed byMr. Amery (C.P.2720) for concluding some agreementcomparable to the Loucheur-Rathenau Agreement,whereby reparations in kind furnished, by Germany mightbe employed for the development of the Crown Colonies-This would still further increase the credit and enablefurther developments to be undertaken^ and fufbherorders to be placed.The Cabinet agreed(a) That the proposals of the Secretary ofState for the Colonies in relationto reparations In kind by Germany, were of great interest and worthy of carefulconsideration, and they invited himto work them out In further detail and advise them further.     For themoment, however, they were not sufficiently developed to form partof the proposals to be made by theGovernment when Parliament meets?(b) That the orders placed by the Dominionsand Colonies would come before theCommittee to be set v.p under theGairloch Scheme., only in cases wherethe guarantee of the British Governmentwas required.
&apos;f3) Ehe^Gabinet thon-dS^T^sed^che O^mpni\-&amp;ovy Distress&apos;tevy*&amp;!baB9- - (Section I (h) of -blue Report of the committee) and after ooasidj^aSjCLa -disoiisalon agreed^-To sanction the scheme to the extent thatthe Cabinet Committee on unemployment should he authorised to consultrepresentatives of employers, includingSir Allan Smith and laboura the schemeto be put forward on the basis thatthe State*s contribution would be 3&amp;DBo other part of the Government*sUnemployment Scheme to be communicatedto the Employers and Labour0
ROADS, (4)   Pn the subject of Roads (Section 2, paragraph (d)of the Report of the Unemployment Committee) attentionwad drawn to the further schemes referred to in Sub-paragraph (iii)for the construction of roade in greater London which would, relieve unemployment in thelast End districts but which raised the difficult question that the unemployed men put on the work wouldbe drawn from districts other than those throughwouldwhich the roads/pass, with the consequent difficultyof securing contributions from the Local authorities concerned.- It ,was pointed cut that further -pressure was being put upon these Local Authorities to contribute, butthat the Unemployment Committee had suggested that theschemes in question should be undertaken at theexpense of the Exchequer, &amp;t&amp;jii although the contributions of Local Authorities fell below the basis .of $0%which had been agreed to for the roads in paragraph(d) (JL.) She Cabinet agreed:-That the construction of the roads .referred to in paragraph d (iii) of theUnemployment Committee Report should proceed and that the Ministry ofTransport should endeavour to get thebest terms they could from theLocal Authorities concerned.
.&apos;OHT CREDITS. (5) With reference- to. Section S (b) of tiio   -Report of the -Unemployment Commlti^ear^Jxe---PARLIAMSirTARTSECRETARY FOR OVERSEAS TRADE stated that since the submission of the report, an amendment had been proposed to the Export Credits Scheme, which wouldinvolve no increase in tho Government1s share ofuncovered risk, but which it was thought would meet with the approval of traders.The Cabinet agreedThat the suggested amendment shouldbe referred for examination to theTreasury and the Board of Trade, andthat if no objection was raised toit,  it should be incorporated in thoExport Credits Scheme,,
