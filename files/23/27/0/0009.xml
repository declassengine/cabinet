I IMPERIALplicationI Names of$-Committee.EDUCTIONtJS THE(PANTRY OPBE TERRI-ORIALORCEcMilitaryPolicy.(1) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a question in the House of Commons, asking for publication of the names of the members of the Sub-Committee on indian military Requirements.Although no special objection was seen to annotincingthe names in this particular case, the Cabinet agreed -That the previous practice of not publishing the names Of members of Sub-Committees(much of whose work is necessarily of a highly secret character) of the Committeeof Imperial. Defence, to which exceptionhas rarely been made, was a sound one and should as a general rule be adhered to.(S) With reference tc Cabinet 8 (21), Appendix II,Conclusion (4), the Cabinet had before them the following documents t-A memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (Paper CP.-3231),A Note by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.  (Paper C6?*-3259).The immediate question at issue was as to the carrying out of a decision taken by the Army Council in 1921,to disband the 21 battalions of the Territorial Force withthe fewest recruits on July 1st, 1921.     The Cabinet were informed that 18 of these had been satisfactorily absorbed by a process of amalgamation, one battalion (Inns of court) had agreed to become an Officers Training Corps,and the question before the Cabinet arose mainly out ofthe propdsed amalgamation of the 4th and 5th battalions of Black Watch, raised respectively by the City of Dundeeand Forfarshire.     Attention was also called to theproposed suppression of the Oxfordshire Yeomanry, the firstAuxiliary Troops to proceed to France in 1914.Arising out of this question and out of the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Cabinetentered upon a discussion of a preliminary character on british/
British Military Policy,     The suggestion was made thatour military system is governed by the conditions whichpertained at the time of the Armistice rather than bya study of the future military requirements of theEmpire.     In particular, it was suggested that the rapiditywith ushich technical troops, including artillery and mechanical transport, can be improvised in a country with our great industrial resources, had not been takensufficiently into account.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Standing Defence Sub-Committeeshould Immediately report to theCabinet as to the military commitments of theBritish Empire, as a preliminary to an examination of the suitability of our military organisation for oarrying out these commitments.(A memorandum prepared by the Secretary^l5&quot;ep&apos;artmehTg&quot; oonoo:r-near, Xl^alreaffy   &quot;*available as ja^alfxs for &quot;discus sTon,f CTrrpTPaperHJkTJgoT-B) o )&apos;(b) That the examination of the military organisation should be taken up Inconnection with the forthcoming dis-discussion by the Cabinet on the subjectof Government Expenditures(c) That the Secretary of State for war should continue to give effect to thegeneral policy in regard to the re-duct ion of the Territorial Force setforth In his Memorandum (Paper CP, 3231).(d) That the Secretary of State for war should not, during the next six months,press forward the conversion intotechnical troops of eleven YeomanryRegiments now temporarily continuingas Cavalry which did not desire suchconversion.(3) The Cabinet had before them the following papers on the subject of the position of the coal-miningindustry sA Memorandum/
A Memorandum &quot;by tho President of theBoard of Trade (Paper C.F.i54S2).An Extract from the Conclusions of theCabinet Committee on Unemployment (40thConclusions, Minute 3).It -was explained by the President of the Boardof Trade that an appeal had been made by the ExecutiveCommittee of the Miners&apos; Federation that the sum of 3,000,000, by which the expenditure on the subventionof wages under the Agreement of July 1st, 1921, had fallen short of the maximum of  10,000,000, should be devotedto the assistance of the coal-mining Industry.In the course of the discussion reference was made tothe recent Award of Sir William Plender and to the wide-spread dissatisfaction in certain quarters with hisinterpretation of &quot;actual realised profits&quot;.The Cabinet agreed with the recommenda-tion of the Unemployment Committee, via s-&quot;That the Miners&apos; Federation should beInformed that it was impossible to makeany further grant for the especial as-sistanee of the coal-mining industry&quot;.The Board of Trade to take the necessary action.(4) With reference to Cabinet 79 (21), Conclusion8j the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Ministerof Labour dealing with the Draft Conventions andRecommendations of the Genoa International LabourConference, 1920 (Paper CP.-3373) *Attention was drawn particularly to the Draft Con-vention dealing with facilities for finding employment for seamen (Appendix 1,(3)),The Cabinet agreed -To concur generally with the proposals ofthe Minister of Labour- subject io thesettlement of any outstanding pointswith the President of the Board of Trade.(6) The/

It will be seen that except with regard to theproposed draft conventions for a weekly Rest Day, no seriousmodification of the original instructions is required.Unless my colleagues desire to make any comment,I shall, therefore, assume that the Instructions in CP.3215,subject to the modification suggested in Sir Montague Barlow&apos;sMemorandum aitaohed, stand approved by the Cabinet,(Intd.)

IKTBRjiATlOKAL LABOUR QRGAliI3A.TION .Supplementary Instructions to the Government Delegatesfor the Conference at Geneva commencing25th October,  1921.IpMIDJll. BY THB EARLIAMEIT1AR Y SECRETARYTO IRE MIMSlMtY Off LABOUR.1. The texts of the proposed draft conventions andrecommendations drafted by the International Labour Office as abasis of discussion at the Conference have now been received andare circulated as an Appendix to this paper (Enclosures A - S,).These texts have been examined by the International LabourCommittee ,-and, as a result of consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, certain modifications of the original instructions are desirable; but save in regard to the Weekly Rest Day. thesemodifications are not of great importance.2. As regards the weekly Rest Day, two Conventions onparallel lines (Enclosures m and m) are proposed, one for industrial enterprises and the other tor commercial establishmentsirom the replies of other Governments to the Questionnairesissued by the I.L.0 ., it appears not improbable that the necessary two-thirds majority of votes may be secured in favour of bothConventions.It seems clear -(I)    That no Convention is possible in the case of shops and commercial establishments in Great Britain, andthe British Delegates must oppose altogether thesecond Convention relating to commercial establishments.(11)   As to industrial undertakings, if the British Delegatesconfine themselves to supporting the recommendation as originally contemplated (see Home Affairs Committeedecision of 17th August, 1921), it is unlikely/ that- 1 -
that they win secure any fair measure of support.It would be regrettable, however, supposing a -Convention on industrial undertakings is proposed, if great Britain, which is the pioneer of the Weekly ixostDay - l&amp; semaine anglaise - should be put in theposition of voting against the measure at a. LabourConference.     It is, therefore, for consideration whether, if only as a matter of tactics, the british delegates should not at the outset propose a convention of leas ambitious scope, confinea to industrial under-takings and embodying the English practice.     This,if adopted, would involve little, if any, administra-tive supervision.In a separate note (iaielosure R) I give the headings of such a Convention as the Home Office&apos; and the Ministry ofLabour think presents no great difficulties from the british point of view and is such as if pressed the British Delegatesmight agree to,     If it were substantially modified the BritishGovernicent Delegates would have an opportunity, in the courseof debate, of making their position dear and could vote against any measure which failed to secure that the conditions imposedupon the State were sufficiently elastic.3. personally, on the whole, I should prefer that theBritish Delegates be instructed to press for a Kecommendation,if possible, and to oppose a Convention,     I see many possibledifficulties if attempts were made to embody for this countryexisting customs, which do in last secure a weekly jXest Day, inan Act of parliament.     And. there is the danger that if GreatBritain proposes a convention on lines which we could accept andthen this is so modified by the conference that we have to vote against it and refuse to ratify it, yet pressure may be urought/ upon
upon, the Government to introduce legislation at Westminsterembodying the Convention as proposed by the. British government at Geneva on the ground that the British Government Delegatesagreed that legislation up to that point was possible.It therefore, propose that the British Delegates be instructed -(a) To press for a Recommendation as originally proposed and confined to industrial undertakings,(b) That if this be rejected, the British government delegates should use discretion as to whether theyshould propose the outlines of a Convention such asindicated in Enclosure R.Except in regard to the proposed draft conventionsfor the Weekly Rest Day (Enclosures M &amp; N), no seriousmodification of the original instructions is required, aswill be seen from the attached Appendix and enclosures.C.

i. *J e)ENCLOSURE R*SUGGESTED READS OF CONVENTJON AS agreed by HOME OFFICE AND M3 NISTRY OF LABOUR^Tho Convention must be confined to industrial undertakings.The Convention should proceed on the lines that subjectto the exceptions to be specified in the Convention all workersin an industrial undertaking (to be defined in the Convention)shall be allowed a rest period of 24 consecutive hours in everyseven days.(]foteit is distinctly preferable that there shouldbe no reference in the Convention to the weeklyrest day being Sunday.    It is usually Sunday inthis country, but the importance of not mention-lng Sunday is that in trades or industries whererest is given cn another day the mention of sunday in the Convention might involve a claim for Sunday work in all cases where necessary,to be paid for at enhanced rates.)This provision will not apply at all to exceptions whichmust includo tho followings-(a) Cases of accident or breakdown, and urgent ropatr.(b) Occupations where the work Is essentially intermittent.(c) Industries or processes within an Industry which, byreason of their nature, require to bo carried oncontinuously by a succession of consecutive shifts, and where the rest period of 24 hours cannot be arranged forall tho workers in the Industrial undertaking.(d) Transport of passengers or goods by rail and inland waterways.(e) Agriculture.(f) Industrial undertakings or occupations within an industrial undertaking which are dependent upon tidalcondit ions.($oteThese exceptions are based on certain broad principles.   They must be regarded as theminima.    It will be necessary to consider in detail others, such as public utilityserviced, o.g. tramways * transport of passen-gers by vehicles plying for public hire, gas,electric light, waterworks, docks.)
It is also desirable that a clause should beprovided dealing with exceptional pressure of work.This could perhaps most conveniently be effected by allowing work to be done on the weekly rest day period for not more than, a specified number of days in theoourso of the year,    If the exceptions in the previousclauso are adequate there does not appear to be ^needfor a provision for contracting out in the Convention.N^B&apos;     m order to be acceptable the Convention must not(1)     Impose any liability for enforcement of its pro-visions by the Bxecutlvo machinery of the State.     TheConvention would confer rights on workpeople, and en-forcomeiii must be left to the employers and workers concerned In the Industry.     No question of partial or temporary exemptions all of which would entail Governmentinspection and interference should be accepted.(S)     Impose any liability on the part of the employerfor compensation to hie workers in cases where the weeklyrest period is not, under the Convention, required to begiven.

AGRICULTURAL QUESTIONS. Items 2, 3, and 4 of the Agenda.

Item 2. (Enclosure A) Recommendation regarding Hours.

The British Government Delegates may support the Recommendation, subject to modifications allowing of greater elasticity to meet special cases.

Item 3. (Enclosure B) Adaptation to agricultural labour of the Washington decisions concerning:-

(a) MEASURES FOR THE PREVENTION OF OR PROVIDING AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT.

The British Government Delegates should not adhere to the legal argument that the measures proposed by the International Labour Office are outside the scope of the Washington Decisions. They should, if opportunity arises, take part in the discussion on these recommendations (Encl. B) and object to certain of them both on general grounds and on account of their infringement on national policy.

(b) PROTECTION OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

(i) Maternity Recommendation (Enclosure C). 

The proposed text is based upon the Washington Convention which H.M. Government have refused to ratify. The recommendation accordingly cannot be accepted and no modification of the original instructions is therefore necessary.

(ii) Employment of Women on Night work (Enclosure D).

The principle of this recommendation may be accepted subject to its being made clear that no obligation is thereby imposed upon Governments to enforce it by inspection. With a view to avoiding any suoh obligation the Government delegates should propose that the recommendations be redrafted on the following
following lines:-&quot;It is suggested that Members of the Internationallabour Organisation shall take steps to encourageassociations of employers and employed to make agreementsproviding that women wage-earners employed in agriculturalundertakings during the night shall enjoy a period of restoompatible with their physical necessities&quot;.(iii) Employment of Children in Agriculture (End. b).Article I of the proposed draft convention is in accord-ance with British practice and may therefore be aocepted inprinciple, provided that it is not to come into operation now Section 8 of the Education Act 1918, is brought into. force.Articles 2 and 3 will require drafting modifications tosecure that the proposed exceptions in favour of technicalinstruction or vocational training are not abused.(iv) Emplcyment of children and young persons on ffight-work&quot; jEnolv %Y*If the proposed Recommendation were redrafted to follow the principle of the amendment to Encl. D. in (ii) above, itshould be supported by the British Government Delegates.Item 4. SPECIAL MEASURES FOR TE3 PROTECTION OP AGRICULTURALU0RK3RS.(i) Vocational Education (End, G).    Subject to verbalamendments, the Government Delegates may accept the proposed,recommendation.^1) Livlng-ln conditions and accommodation generally (Eno1.H).As drafted, the rsoommendation might involve a degree of regulation and inspection greatly in excess of that providedby the laws or byelaws of the Public Health Authorities of theUnited Kingdom.    It cannot therefore be accepted by theGovernment Delegates.   The latter may, however, support a recommendation that Members should do all in their power to/deal
deal adequately with the evils envisaged in the recommendations.(ill) Rights of Association (End. I).   The draft conventionprepared by the I.1.0. is in aocor&amp;anoe with British law andmay therefore bo accepted by the Government Delegatos,(iv) P rot so t ion ^ agai ng t acoiden t f,^ siofeness, inval idltg;&quot;&quot;and&quot; olcPage TSSnoTT&quot;jT7&quot; &quot;        -   -Draft convention concerning workmonTs compensation -The Government Delagates may support the text prepared by the1.1.0. provided that the benefits to be conferred arorestricted in their application to the same classes of workers as are comprised in the Workmen^ Compensation Aots (viz.,all manual workers and othor employed persons whose totalremuneration does not exceed  250 p.a.)*    It might be desirablethat the benefits should bo available for foreign workers onlyon a basis of reciprocity and it may be anticipated that this qualification &quot;will be introduced by representatives of otherGovernments.Recommendation concerning social insurance laws -This recommendation may only be accepted by the government delegates ii it is established that it does not apply to unemployment insurance for agricultural workers.Item 5. Convention concerning disinfection of wool infected withAnthrax spores (Bnol, ICT.This draft convention is generally in accordance with british requirements and, subjoot to some small amendments, may be.accepted.    It is felt that the expenses involved by any meet-ings of the Commission created by Article 2 that may be necessaryare an incidental charge to which no objection oan be takonsThe proposed text provides for disinfection being carried outin the exporting country, or where this is not possible, in the importing country.   From the British point of view, however,it might have been preferable to require that disinfectionshould take place always in the exporting country but tho/latitude
latitude now proposed to be allowed should make theconvention more acceptable to the importing countries,,   the delegates may therefore accept tho proposal.It would be desirable to secure agreement with theIndian and Dominion Delegates5and the British Delegates shouldtake any possible^rstops for this purpose.Item 6. Prohibition of the Use of White Lead in Painting. fSncLL).&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; -The convention drafted by the I.L.O. apart from merits,. -requires amendment, as the precise scope of the convention isnot altogether clear.   Assuming that a convention Is adopted on tho basis of prohibition in some oases and regulation inothars, the attitude of tha Government (as laid down in the replies to the I.L.0. Questionnaire) precludes the British.Delegates from voting either for or against such a Convention,or, in fact, any convention which accepts prohibition or regulation or both. ^The instructions already issuad require the delegates to*.adopt a non-committal attitude on the question of prohibitionand regulation.    It follows therefore that they will not beentitled to vote for a convention which is based either onprohibition or on regulation or on a combination of both.Item 7. Weekly rest day in industrial and commercial establishments,,(Snols. M.N. &amp; 0.).   The conventions as drafted by the I.L.O.cannot be accepted, nor can the resolution regarding aSaturday half-holiday, which is ultra vires.    In no case should,any convention with rospect to commercial undertakings beaccepted.   Subject to further directions by the Cabinet theBritish Delegates may in certain circumstances agree to aconvention applying exclusively to industrial&apos; undertakings, andinvolving no administrative responsibility for enforcement.Tho headings of such a convention are given in Tjuclosure R./Item
Item 8* (a) Age of admission of Young, Persons to Employment at sea asf.trimm3rg and stokers (and. p,).   TheGovernment Delegates should support this draft convention.(b) Compulsory medioal examination of children and youngpersons employed at sea ($nol.     ).   The? government delegates should not suppert the convention as draftad.   as stated in tho original Instructions, provided the firstconvention (encl * p) is carried, a convention may be supportedrestricting medloal examination to children under 16 (ifpressed, up to 18 years of age) on first entry into theservice.   The examination should be confined to entry andshould not impose re-examination at periodic intervals;   itshould not, morsever, involve a charge upon public funds, andthis should bo mado dear.

Wicks, Secretary to the Committee.Default of thePoplar borough council.[6802]With reference to H. A.C. 95, Conclusion 4, the Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Health(CP. 3203) on the default of the Poplar Council to levy rates pre-cepted to them by the London County Council and other authorities,to which was appended the opinion of the Law Officers to the effectthat except in the case of the sum required for police purposes noremedies were available except the remedy of mandamus andattachment.Sir Aubrey Symonds, on behalf of the Ministry of Health, madea statement to the Committee on the present position.   Writs of
attachment had been issued in respect of thirty-one members of theCouncil out of a total of forty-nine members.From information received from the Town Clerk it appeared that one-third of the total members constituted a quorum. In any event the Council had made the necessary arrangements for the gcarrying on of their business until Christmas, including the directions &quot;for the levying of the next rate. There was a special meeting of themembers on the following afternoon for the purpose of initiating a propaganda campaign. Those members, in respect of whom writs ofattachment had been issued, were quite determined to be martyrs,and only a complete concession of all their claims would change thisdecision. Some of their demands had already been met. As theresult of a conference between representatives of the London boards of Guardians and the Ministry of Health the arrangements made during the war relating to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fundhad been abandoned, and the reversion to the practice formerly pre-vailing would result in a relief to Poplar of some 30,000L per year.On the other hand, the Council also complained that they hadnot received any grant from the Lord St. David&apos;s unemployment grants Committee. It was impossible to meet them on this. TheLord St. David&apos;s Committee had rejected their application owing totheir refusal to give preference to ex-service men. Their mainclaim, however, was in respect of the equalisation of rates. TheStanding Joint Committee of the Metropolitan Borough Councilshad recently been considering a proposal to increase the EqualisationRate in the London area from 6d. to Is. The Borough Councilsmight be prepared to agree to this, but it was doubtful whether theLondon County Council would agree. Legislation would be required.If it were passed, it would relieve Poplar to the extent of l9,000Lper year, and reduce their rates by 5^d. It should also be observedthat the Terms of Reference to the Royal Commission on greater london included consideration of the equalisation of rates which hadbeen expressly inserted on account of such places as Poplar and west Ham.Judging, however, by what the Town Clerk said, it was doubtfulwhether anything short of a complete concession of the full demandswould prevent the members of the Council from going to prison.It had been suggested that the Precepting Authorities might accept payment of the sums due by instalments. But the Ministryof Health were advised, and the London County Council agreed,that this was impossible on legal grounds, as infringing the general rule on retrospective rating.- Even if the legal difficulty could begot over, the Ministry of Health were advised that such a concession would immediately be followed by other poor Boroughs asking for similar terms.An analysis of the rates in Poplar was instructive. The averagegeneral rate for 1920-21 in London was 14s. lid!. in Poplar 22s. lOd.In respect of services rendered by a Central Authority and of local expenditure borne centrally the average rate in London boroughswas 9s. od.- in Poplar 9s. Sd. The average rate in the London boroughs in respect of expenditure borne locally, i.e., Guardians&apos;and Borough Councils&apos; expenditure, was 5s. 8d. in Poplar)3s. lid. These figures show that the heavy rates in Poplar were due to the policy of the Poplar Borough Council, which included,amongst other extravagances, the payment of 5,000Z. a week onout-relief. The number of out-door paupers per thousand was92&quot;5 in Poplar, while in Whitechapel it was 0&apos;2.The Chairman observed that a knowledge of these facts wasvital to a correct appreciation of the situation, and suggested thatpublicity should be given to them by a question in Parliament.Sir Aubrey Symonds, continuing, said that dating from a time before the Poplar enquiry in 1906 up to the present time, it was known to be the policy of Mr. Lansbury to make the administrationof the borough impossible in order to seciire complete equalisatioa
Prohibition of the 2. With   reference  to   H.A.C.   89,   Conclusion   1   (a),  theuse of White Lead Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the home in Painting. Secretary (CP. 3221), giving the proposed terms of reference and members of a new committee to re-examine the question of thedanger from the use of lead paints, and the proposals to substituteleadless for lead paints, in view of the further informationforthcoming from the Office of Works and elsewhere since the enquiries of the previous Committees. It was suggested that theterms of reference would unduly narrow the scope of the Com-mittee&apos;s investigations, and that words should be chosen whichwould make it clear that it was the intention to throw the wholequestion open.The Home Secretary read a letter received from the first commissioner of Works, in which certain suggestions were made,on the one hand, to add pathological experts to the Committee and,on the other hand, to give the Admiralty, Office of Works,Government of India, commercial users and manufacturers anopportunity to be heard otherwise than by merely giving evidence.The Home Affairs Committee agreed (1.) To approve the membership of the Committee as proposedby the Home Secretary and to refer the redrafting ofthe terms of reference to the Chairman, Home secretary and Solicitor-General for final decision.(2.) That Government Departments, commercial users and manufacturers of white lead should give evidence beforethe Committee, but shotild not otherwise be entitled tobe heard.of London rates. The Ministry of Health were not asking theHome Affairs Committee to take any action, the only question was whether any effort should be made to prevent the members of theCouncil from going to prison, and, on the whole, it seemed desirable to let matters take their course.The Committee were generally agreed that steps should betaken to give &quot;full publicity to the facts, either by questions inParliament, by giving information to the press, or by thedistribution of leaflets.The Home Secretary requested the guidance of the Committeeon the point whether he should endeavour to secure payment of theMetropolitan police rate by his power of appointing occasionaloverseers under an Act of 1829! On the whole, h.e doubted the advisability of having recourse to an obsolete statute.Sir Aubrey Symonds stated, in reply to a question, that theinhabitants of Poplar, even the more prosperous classes, were inclined to sympathise with the Borough Council, and resistance wastherefore not unlikely.The Solicitor-General concurred in the view that it would be .unwise to proceed under the Act, particularly having regard to thefact that the police rate formed a very small part of the total charge.The Home Affairs Committee agreed (i.) To request the Ministry of Health to take suitable steps togive full publicity to the true facts of the case in regardto the high rates in Poplar,(ii.) That the Home Secretary should not endeavour to collect the Metropolitan police rate by the appointment ofoccasional overseers,(iii.) That no steps should be taken to prevent the members ofthe Borough Council from undergoing imprisonment inconsequence of the proceedings before the Lord chief justice.
Weekly Best Day. 3. With  reference   to  H.A.O.   89,   Conclusion  1   (6),   theCommittee had under consideration a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. 3224) on the proposal that the British Governmentshould be prepared to accept at the meeting of the InternationalLabour Conference an international convention establishing theprinciple of the Weekly Rest Day in industrial undertakings.The Home Affairs Committee at their previous meeting had requested the Home Office and Ministry of Labour in consultationto prepare a draft Bill in order to inform the Cabinet of the kind ofmeasure to which they would be committed if they agreed to accepta Convention. A draft of a Bill was accordingly submitted, butconcurrently the Home Secretary stated in his Memorandum thatas the Minister of Labour still had considerable hesitation aboutagreeing to the introduction of legislation, and did not see his wayto support the proposal for an International Convention, it was not proposed to press the matter beyond the previous decision of theHome Affairs Committee to support a recommendation only at themeeting of the International Labour Conference.&apos;The Home Secretary further suggested that if the british delegates at the Conference found that the Conference was practicallyor nearly unanimous in favour of a Convention, the British Govern-ment should have a further opportunity of considering the matter, andthe British Delegates should be instructed to report home fully on thesituation and ask for further instructions as to whether, in thecircumstances, it might be desirable for them to vote for theConvention.The Home Affairs Committee agreed : (1.) To adhere to their previous decision to support a recom-mendation at the meeting of the International LabourConference in favour of establishing the principle of the weekly Rest Day in industrial undertakings ;(2.) That if the British delegates at the Conference find thatthe Conference is practically or nearly unanimous infavour of a Convention, the Government should have afurther opportunity of considering the matter, and thatthe Delegates should be instructed to report home fullyon the situation, and ask for further instructions as towhether, in the circumstances, it might not be desirable for them to vote for the Convention.Juries Bill. 4. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP. 3222) covering the draft of a Bill toamend the law relating to the preparation of Jury Lists. Thepurpose of the Bill, in the interests of economy, is to abolish theexisting system in which separate Jury Lists are prepared andprinted, and to enable the register of electors to be used as a basis for the formation of the &quot;Jurors&apos; Book.&quot; It was not possible tostate the total saving which would be effected, but as an illustrationthe case was quoted of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth,.where the present cost of printing is 500L per annum. The initial. cost under the new system will not exceed 250L in the year in whichthe change is made, and in subsequent years 151.The object of introducing the Bill was to elicit criticisms and suggestions. The Bill would then be reintroduced and passed inthe following session.The Home Affairs Committee agreed To: authorise the Home Secretary to introduce the Juries Billin the House of Commons forthwith, with a view to its passage into law in the &quot;following session.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,August 17, 1921.o

The Minister of Health informed the Committee thatthe proposals in clause 1 of the Bill were of a somewhat contentious ^character. As the Committee were aware, the financial position ofcertain of the East London local authorities was one of serious embarrassment, and among other remedies it had been suggestedthat relief could satisfactorily be afforded by some modiQcation of&quot;The London (Equalisation of Rates) Act 1894,&quot; in the direction ofincreasing the burden on the richer boroughs for the purposeof helping the poorer boroughs in the East End. As a result ofinterviews with London Mayors and others, it had transpired that,with the exception of the City of London, which had so far refusedto do anything, the richer boroughs would probably assent to anincrease of the rate under the Act of 1894 from 6d. to 9d. ThePoplar Borough Council had put forward proposals for the creationof a Central Board of-Guardians for London, which would deal withoutdoor relief over the whole of the London area. These proposals were of a very elaborate nature, and he (Sir A. Mond) did not thinkit necessary to investigate them further at the moment. The sameCouncil had also suggested that the rate under the Act of 1894should be raised to 2s. This, in his view, would be too great an-increase.If the contribution was increased to Is., the result on thelarger aiding authorities would be to increase their contributions tothe following sums : City of LondonWestminsterHolbornMarylebone300,000 per annum320,00042,00064,000with, of course, smaller contributions from other aiding authorities.The total benefit to the poorer boroughs from an Equalisation Rateof 1 s. would be as follows :-- Deptf ordHackneyPoplarIslington   ...CamberwellBethnal Green28,000 per annum.56,000 &apos;41,00085,00076,00035,000A large number of other boroughs would receive smaller sums.It should be noted that certain boroughs, such as East and WestHam, whose finances are in a desperate condition, would not deriveany benefit from the proposals, for the reason that they are outsidethe London area.The First Commissioner of Works pointed out that the increaseproposed would, in -the case of Westminster, mean a very heavy additional charge on the Exchequer in respect of the sum payable in lieu of rates on Government buildings.In the course of the subsequent discussion, it was pointed outthat the-relief to be&apos; given to Poplar under the proposals would not get that borough out of its financial difficulties, which were mainly due to the high scale of out-door relief actually given, and also tothe fact that the relief itself was granted in many cases without proper consideration. The fact that 125 per thousand of thepopulation of Poplar was in receipt of out-door relief as againstmuch lower percentage figures in the neighbouring boroughs,indicated the reckless way in which the Poplar Guardians weredischarging their responsibilities.
Temporary powerof precept-issuingauthorities to levyrates when borough council in default.Temporaryborrowing bylocal authorities.The Committee were informed, on tke other hand, thata readjustment recently made of the Metropolitan Common PoorFund payments would give Poplar an extra 55,000Z. per annumapart from what she would receive under the present scheme.Even if the &quot;Rill did not wholly meet the Poplar situation, it wouldhave a very beneficial effect in restraining other boroughs whichwere at present thinking of imitating the defaulting procedure, ofthe Poplar Borough Council.The Minister of Health informed the Committee that he was inno way pledged as regards the raising of the 6d. to 9d. he proposed to summon a meeting of local authorities, and if, as seemed probable, agreement among the authorities was found impossible, he wished to be in a position to inform the meeting thatthe Government had decided to increase the rate under the Act of1894 from bU to Is.The Committee decided To approve clause 1 of the Draft Bill, subject to the insertion in line 5 of sub-clause (i) of the words &quot; one shilling.&quot;(2.) The Minister of Health informed the Committee that clause 3 of the Bill as drafted gave each authority in respect of whose rates default is made, power to appoint a person approved bythe Minister of Health to levy the rates. The alternative procedure under which the London County Council, as the authority mostconcerned, might on default step in and levy rates was objected toby the Council on the ground that, while willing in such an eventto collect the amount of its own rate, it would not take responsibilityfor collecting the rates of other precepting authorities. He (SirA. Mond) had come to the conclusion that power should be reservedin the Bill for the Minister of Health to appoint a person to levy therates in the event of a precepting authority declining to make suchan appointment.The Committee agreed To approve the terms of clause 3 of the Bill as drafted,subject to the addition of a provision reserving power &quot;to theMinister of Health in the last resort to appoint a person to levythe rates, if other means fail.(3.) The Minister of Health informed the Committee that theprovisions of clause 4 of the Bill were designed to legalise thetemporary borrowing by local authorities, subject to the consent ofthe Minister of Health and to repayment within the same financialyear, for the purposes of meeting current expenses incurred bythem in the execution or performance of any of their powers or duties. A similar provision, which, however, omitted the require-ment of the consent of the Minister, had been inserted in recentyears in many local Bills.Objection was taken to the absence of any time limit (say, threeyears) for the exercise of the borrowing powers, but it was pointedout that the authorities did, in fact, now borrow from their bankerswithout statutory authority, and that the insertion of a time limitwould merely have the effect of stopping such borrowing at the close of the period.The Committee agreed (1.) To approve clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill as drafted.(2.) That, provided the Cabinet accepted the principle of theproposed legislation, the Minister of Health should, afterconsultation with the Government Whips, be authorisedto introduce the Bill in the form approved by theCommittee in the House of Commons.

In his opinion the Bill was substantially non-contro-versial.The Committee agreed To approve the Bill and, subject to the concurrence of the chief whip, to authorise the Secretary for Scotland to introduceit in the House of Commons. .2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,October 17, 1921.o
