ii        . * i        &apos; .219(1)     With reference to Cabinet 89 (21).,.. Conclusion 1,the Cabinet had before them a copy of the Articles ofAgreement (CP.3529) which had been signed at 2030 aam,that morning by the British and Irish Delegations..THE PRE ME MINISTER informed his colleagues thatin his opinion to-day was one of the greatest days inthe history of the British Empire.     Early this morninga Treaty of Peace had been signed between the represents-tives of the British and Irish peoples.     The disputes andfriction between the two peoples had been a source of weakness, not merely to Great Britain but to the Empireand a permanent settlement of the Irish problem wouldenormously incree.se Great Britain5 s prestige in theworld and would show that she wa3 still capable of over-coming almost JLnsuperable dlf f difficulties*     A just and righteoussettlement of the Irish question was vitally necessary at the present moment and would have the most beneficialeffects in America and elsewhere.While some difficulties still remained, thegreatest had been overcome.     Among the latter mightbe mentioned m (l) the reluctance of the Irish extremiststo swear allegiance to the King and to repudiate ahIrish Republic; (ii) the difficulty of inducing people with hereditary dislike of the British Empire and all-that it represented to agree to enrol themselves as members of the Empire; (iii) to make some settlement acceptable by Ulster, - the rock upon which all previousefforts had been shattered.For the first time in the history of Ireland the extremists had accepted a situation in which it was open to Ulster to contract out of a united Ireland.She would under the Articles of Agreement have one month in which to make up her mind and it must be noted thatthe British representatives had adhered absolutelyto the pledges given to Ulster.     Ulster, under the
arrangements would not &quot;be coerced, but if she desiredto exercise the option of remaining with the UnitedKingdom, then she must be prepared to share the burdens and responsibilities of the UnitedKingdom for better or worse.If Ulster remained with Great Britain, itwould be necessary to fix her boundaries afreshand it had been represented that a Boundary commission would possibly give Ulster more than she would lose.The terras of the Oath to be taken by Members ofthe Parliament of the Irish Free State were remarkableand were better in many respects than the terms of the oath of Allegiance ordinarily required in GreatBritain,The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet ofthe difficulties which had been experienced withthe Irish Representatives on the previous evening,and it was only at the very end that thoserepresentatives had eventually agreed to the termsnow incorporated in Ct.Pc3529.In conclusion the Prime Minister stated thatspeaking for himself and for his colleagues on theIrish Committee he desired to say how. deeply indebtedthey all felt to their colleagues in the Cabinet forthe absolute trust and loyalty which had been displayedduring the negotiations.      Success would have been impossible but for the absolute confidence whichthe Cabinet had reposed In the British Representatives.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he wished to exp]ess the unanimous feeling of gratitude which filled every member of the Cabinet
towards the Prime Minister and his colleagues forthe part which they had played in the recent negotiations.     The settlement of the Irishdifficulty was one of the most remarkable events in the history of the British Empire and it represented an astonishing victory for the empire which would have Incalculable effects throughoutthe whole world and in particular would remove adark cloud which had hung for years over GreatBritain8a relations with the United States ofAmerica^     The most cordial thanks of the cabinet were due to the Prime Minister and his colleagues who had given months of anxious thought and timeto this problem, had shown unlimited patience andforbearance, had maintained an unfailing fidelityto the pledges given and had shown throughoutIndomltible courage.    All would, he/elt sure,agree that the success attained was mainlyattributable to the skill, wisdom, ability andforesight displayed by the Prime Ministers and he,Lord Curzon was proud to have the privilege onthis occasion of expressing the views of the Cabinet,The Cabinet unanimously agreed :^(1)   to express their enltre approvalof the settlement effected and ofthe attitude adopted by the british representatives throughout thenegotiations, and(ii) to associate themselves with the remarks made by the Secretary 6 State for Foreign Affairs.
(2.)     In the:- courae-*xf&quot;&quot;th^reference was made to the fact that the Articles ofAgreement were to be submitted forthwith by HisMajesty&apos;s GrO-^errnment for the approval of parliament and by the Irish representatives to a Meeting summonedfor the purpose and the members elected to sit inthe House of Commons for Southern Ireland.    The latterMeeting would take place In about seven days time and itwas urged that as evidence of good faith the british parliament should be summoned immediately for the sole purpose of ratifying the Articles of Agreement.It was suggested that the State Opening ofParliament should un this occasion be made asimpressive as possible and that Companies from allthe Regiments of Guards with massed bands shotild be stationed in the neighbourhood of the Houses ofParliament.The Cabinet were informed that His Majesty theKing was overjoyed with the result of the negotiations and that it was His Majesty&apos;s intention t*s conespecially ta London io-rr&amp;rrow for the Meeting of the privy Council for the summoning of ParliamenteThe Cabinet agreed:-(i)   That a Committee composed of -The Prime Minister (Chairman)The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for vfar,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,Viscount FitzAlan,The First Commissioner of ^orksHiCQU^alken   (Secret ary)should make arrangements in connection withthe State Opening of Parliament.til)     That in order to mark the very specialoccasion the Clerk to the Privy council should be requested to summon to theMeeting cf the Privy Council to-norrowall the Members of the Cabinets and theViceroy.
;t H (3)     The&apos; ^fCrlx^i^mT^ st-ion hadbeen &quot;made that Parliament should be summoned to meet^ifimentarycedure. on &quot;Wednesday, December 14th for the sole purpose ofapproving or disapproving the Articles of AgreementsThis would be in accordance with the precedent setat the time of the Union.      It was contemplated thatafter an address in reply had be5n made to HisMajesty&apos;s speech, Resolutions would be introduced in the House of Commons  and subsequently in the Houseof Lords and. on their passage through both Houses ajoint address would be presented to His Majestyexpressing approval of the Articles of Agreement.Parliament would then be prorogued and not adjourned.It was pointed out that under this procedurethere might be two debates, one on the King&apos;s speech and a second on the Resolutionse      Moreover it wouldbe difficult to prevent other subjects being discussed.A suggestion was then made which met with considerable support that the Resolutions should be introducedsimultaneously into the House of Commons and theHouse ef Lords.It was then pointed out that if the precedent ofthe Union Resolution was followed it vaould be verydifficult to get the Resolutions passed before christmas and it was suggested that separateResolutions were not really necessary and that the address in reply to His Majesty&apos;s&quot; Speech could be drafted in such a form as to obviate the need for separate Resolutions.The Cabinet agreed  To r-request the Lord ^rivy Seal and theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs to consider the question of parliamentary procedure and to decide on the best course to adopt, having regard to the considerations indicated in the discussions

The proposal, had, therefore,been made that directly the Articles of agreement had been approved by the British Parliament, andratified by the Irish Parliament, H.h, The king should be advised to order the release of the internees.The Cabinet agreed(1) That H.u. The King should not be advised, to release the Irish interneesuntil after Bail Eireann had ratified the Articles of Agreement;(2) That special consideration would havet-  be given later on to the questionof Irish prisoners in connection withany possible amnesty legislation whichmight be necessary,HM3X3 TO THE 5,    The attention of the Cabinet was drawn toHIEF secretary or IRELAND. criticism which might be expected on the lines thatthe settlement now effected might equally have been      ?reached some time ago.      It was generally agreed,however, that a year ago Sinn Fein would not haveentertained or even agreed, to discuss proposals similarto those which the Irish Representatives had now signed,and that the change In the attitude of Sinn Fein was mainly attributable to the rough treatment    towhich the Irish extremists had been subjected -duringthe last twelvemonths, and which had brought home tothe men In the field the need for some equitablecompromise,/The
tTho- Prime- Ministers -on-behalf of his-colleagues,warmly congratulated the Chief Secretary for ireland on the able and cpxirageous manner in which he hadthroughout discharged the very difficult and dis-agreeable duties entrusted to himj but for theway in which the decisions of the Cabinet had beenenforced by the Irish Executive, and particularly by the Chief Secretary, the present settlexaent would never have come about.
