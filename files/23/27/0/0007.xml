jtoAoYMENTj       2.     ,:/ith reference to Cabinet 79 (21) Conclusion (1),to, GAIRLOCHIcHKlES FOR THE     the -Chancellor of the Exchequer informed his colleaguesh-yiVAL OF TRADE iof the results of the conversations he and the primeMinister had held with the Governor of the Bank ofEngland on the subject of tho capital sum the interestand sinking fund charges on which it is proposed theGovernment should guarantee in the case of approved schemes *    The Governor&apos;was very dubious about theI effect of hanging over the market a big guarantee, suchas. had been suggested, of charges on a total capital sum of  50,000,000,      He was aware of schemes to beplaced on the market sufficient to absorb all themoney available during tho next six months, -any furtherdemands would have to be fitted in as circumstances permitrted.    He (The Governor) was not prepared to advise that the Government guarantee should extend beyond amaximum capital sum of  25.000^000.   The Governor had also expressed himself as strongly opposed to anyproposal to finance the Gairloch guarantee by ways and means advances for say six months;in his view the present commitments of the Exchequer precluded further recoursebeing had to ways and means advancescThe Cabinet (Mien discussed the advisability ofinserting in the Bill a time limit of say 12 monthswithin which the promoters of a scheme must be preparedto take up the money *    The Chancellor of the Exchequerreferred to the difficulties of dealing with proposalsspread over several years, when it would ^e impossibleto forecast the&apos; financial situation.    It would bebetter to treat tho scheme as an experiment and to start it for a short period with a strictly limited liability and if it proved successful ask Parliament
to authorise its extension in tlme^and amount.This view was criticised on the ground that manylarge public utility undertakings requiring several years for completion would be  aitomatically cut out ofthe scheme,- No large contractor would undertake animportant contract unless, he was financially securedo^er the whole period - to meet the point that Itwould be unwise to leave the/ Government liability open for several years It was suggested that, the Governmentshould now do what financial houses used&apos; to do before thewar,&apos;namely, guarantee the finance of the public utilityundertaking by issuing to the contractor&apos; our ranteed bondsagainst certificates of progress as required. - In practicethere -could be no danger of the contractor demanding hismoney before it fell due.    On the other hand it waspointed out that serious results would follow if largeGovernment guarantees matured at a time when the moneymarket was very depressed and. that a scheme such as hadbeen indicated might have the effect of putting theGovernment into tho hands of the contractor or his Banker.The Cabinet agreed;-(1)      That the amount to he devoted to thoGairloch scheme for the revival of trade should be limited to a total sum of 25,000,000 for the present withoutpre indice to the question of invitingParlianent to sanction an increase.ont hi s f i ,31. me should the son em e provesatisfactory and the situation demandan increase:- (11)     That,so far as possible,the Exchequer -should retain, freedom of action underthe Bill and in particular should notbe fettered by statutory conditionsbut should, rather., take power in theBill to make regulations ,   \
3.     With reference to 0abineV76. (21)Conclusion 4, the Cabinet were informed bySir A. Mond, in the absence of the secretary of State for India, that this question had teenfully discussed by the Oabiaet UnemploymentCommittee.     Mr.  Gccdenough the Chairman ofBarclay1s Bank and a member of the India council had laid before the--Committeea proposal for finaneiog...XndJLan-ifaiIway-extra-ordinary expenditure up tc  50,000,000 by meansof short-tern bills to be guaranteed by theBritish Government and discounted on the Londonmoney market.     strong views were expressed that having regard to the large amount of immediateemployment which would bo provided in thiscountry by the giving out of triers for theIndian railway material, arrangements 3hould,if possible, be made for financing the scheme in such a manner as to give the Government ofIndia an inducement to spend the money here.On the Other hand it was pointed out that theproposals made by Mr, GoOdenough differedmaterially from those contemplated by theSecretary of State for India (0*u*275)  thelatter favouring direot financial assistance!from the British Treasury in the form of a loanat a favourable rate of interest repayable by india over a period of years.    Further it wasonly open to India to raise money on the london market since she could not, owing to exohangen&apos;difficulties, have recourse to New York,which
was the only/alternative^        In these circumatanoesIndia ought to be prepared to place her orders here fin return for being granted the use of the london market and without any further advantages.       In thisconnection tho view was strongly expressed thatarrangements should be made with tho Banking interests to forbid the raising of money on the London market to be spent on materials made elsewhoro than in GreatBritain, It was also represented that having regardzyto the fact that  25,000,OO0 only would be available under the Gaixleoh sohemo, every effort should be madeto finanoe the Indian railway proposals otherwise thaaunder that soheme.     On the other hand it was strongly urged that In this respect no preference should boshown to India over the Dominions and Crown Colonies.The Cabinet were reminded that Indians finanoialdifficulties were largely due to the damage to Indianoredit which had resulted from tho disturbances in that country and also that in the present state ofpolitioal feeling in&quot; India it would be useless to askIndia to help to solve tho British tniomployraont problem by placing her orders here.       The only argument whichcould be used would be oho based on the material gainst$ India under the proposed transaction.-The Cablno t agreed  &apos;That the Government policy should aim at encouraging orders for railway, etc.. development from india at the earliest possible time end that means should be sor^ht to finance these orders if possible without havingrecourse to the   5 rC00,000 allotted to the Gairloch scheme, The proposalsalready adopted would give the facilities to make a start and experience wouldenable the Government to decide whether further measures should be undertaken.
(4)    &apos;?/ith reference to Cabinet 79 (2l) Conclusion (;?.)the Cabinet had under consideration a further E -cmorandum(CP .341b) by the Secretary of State for the colonies on the subject of-Imperial 1) eve I opine :-rt and Unemployment.The Cabinet ,-ere informed that the following GrownColonies and Protectorates were in process of floating1 oans on the London rnarket wi without ass j s tancc.Ceylon  3,000,000 loanFigeria  3,000,000    do.Malay States       5,000,000    do.Kenya  7,000,000    do.In addition there were a number of Dominion loans whichwould be floated without help.    There was however a verygreat amount of development work which could be uncxr-particularlytaken/in Colonies in a less advanced stage of dcvelop-ment if Imperial financial assistance w.-:..s forthcoming;Xn some cases a guarantee would stiff ice but in othersthere would have to be actual financial help for aperiod of years -   Apart from benefiting the colonies the development would open markets for British --roodsand in many ways help British trade *It&quot;was pointed out that up to the present theCrown Colonies had experienced no difficulty in floatingallegedtheir loans without help, Shis was to be due tothe benevolent action of the Bank of ;. upland which had arranged to float the loans at convenient times^ but theSecretary of State for the Colonies did not admit this.- &apos; d - ^
in certain cases it would be quite impossible to float- ...forth*k)ming -colonial loans Since the investor would wait for what he considered a hotter security.    As regardsthe proposal to give grants to the poorer Colonies(C&amp;U*. 68 last paragraph) it was pointed out that thiswould he going beyond the Gairloch proposals and wouldbe putting the Colonies into a better position thanpublic utility-undertakings at home.      Schemes of thiskind should be submitted to the Gairloch Scheme Committeein the normal way.       Any proposal to enable the colonies to borrow cheaply at the expense of the British Treasuryinvolved a further depreciation of Government stocks anda consequential outcry from Banks and other large holders of those stooks.-It was then strongly urged that in this matter the Colonies should at liast be givsn as favourable tormsas it was ,prOp0s0ct to give to India? B-oforoaoa was madeto the groat possibilities of dovolopment particularlyin the tropioal Colonies.     On the other hand it waspointed out that the Colonies had already taken recentlylargo sums out of the London market, that there was noreasoh to suppose that they could net raise money withoutandhelp/that in the main Colonial schemes of developmentwore not in ao forward a state as the Indian railwaysohsitfa.      India could not give orders without seme formof financial help, it was most important from every point of view that the  SC-rCOO-.COO Indian
c^enter-a^cts.. should&apos; be secured for this country.It was pointed out that if India and the Colonieswere competing with British undertakings for the 25,000,-000 Gairlqch guarantee that that amount wouldbe wholly insufficient and that it was most important to reserve that guarantee for good business which couldbe financed in no other way,After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed generally  with the following view:-That there are certain Imperial development schemes which will provide substantial employ- ,ment at home and which in the present oircura-stances can be adequately financed withoutassistance from the Imperial Government..There are also other similar schemes of a highly promising nature which are held up orvery seriously retarded by reason of financial difficulties.The Government are prepared to assent  to the proposition that schemes in this latter,category, (which would not In present circumstancebe brought forward in the ordinary way) may besubmitted to the Gairlooh Committee for consideration whether they come from India, the Dominions\the Crown Colonies,or the Protectorates.
LOCAL AUTHORITIES (5)    With reference to Cabinet 79 (21) Conclusion(FINANCIAL PRO-VISIONS) BILL. (7), the Cabinet were informed that at a meetingof representatives of the London local authoritiesheld that day it had proved impossible to reach any measure of agreement on the proposals for assisting the poorer boroughs contained in theopening clause of the draft Local Authorities(Financial Provisions) Bill which had been approvedby the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet that morning,     The Town Clerk of Westminster had, however,formulated a proposal for temporarily equalisingthe burden of out-door relief over the vhole of theLondon County area by adding the cost of such relief to the charges now equalised through the MetropolitanCommon Poor Fund,      This proposal had been receivedfavourably by the meetvng which had appointed aCommittee to examine the details.      If ultimatelyan agreement was reached on the lines of theproposal, that solution was to be preferred asembodying a settlement by consent and as bettercalculated to meet the very heavy bwrden thrown onthe poorer areas because of the existing pressure ofunemployment.The Cabinet agreed:-That if the London Local Authoritiessubmitted a scheme on the lines indicated above the scheme should bereferred to the Home Affairs Committeefor consideration.
0E COMPULSORY 6, With reference to Cabinet 79 (21) Conclusion 3,.STRESS LEVY the Cabinet were informed by the Minister of LabourIB ME. that on October 15th he had seen Messrs. Walker,Poultcny Bowermah and Bramley and had informed them&apos; of the Government proposals as regards the distresslevy scheme.      The proposals were to be consideredby a full meeting of London Labour representatives to be held to-day.The Minister of Labour had also seen repre-sentatlves of the Employers&apos; Associations who weresympathetic towards the scheme.     The employers had suggested that an effort should be made to give thechildren&apos;s benefit in kind and not in cash and had stressed the importance of co-ordinating the benefitswith the Poor Law relief given by the Guardians.Doubts had however been expressed whether the pro-posals might not in themselves lead to furtherunemployment.In the course of the subsequent discussion Itwas pointed out that at present the Guardians were onlunder an obligation to take account,  in grantingPoor Law relief, of 5/- of the 15/- unemploymentbenefit, it was generally felt that in existingclroumstances this practice could not he justified.The Cabinet agreed:-(1)    That the Bill dealing with this scheme should be called the Unemployed Workers 1Dependents  (Temporar:/- Provisions) Bill.(2)    That the Bill should Incorporate therecommendations of the&apos;Relief of DistressCommittee a-s approved by the UnemploymenCommittee of the Cabinet (CP. 3403).(3)    That the Bill shotild contain provisionrequiring Boards of Guardians to take account in fixing Poor Law Relief ofthe whole of the Unemployment insurance benefit,, and the additional benefitsgiven by the scheme.
