IBS sage OPcongratulationkj jr. balfour.she king&apos;spesgh andhe addressREPLYHERETO,ISLAND.POVIBIONALpVJIiRNMEHT.X.   The Lord Privy Seal suggested to the Cabinetthat a message of congratulation from the cabinet should be Sent to Mr. Balfour regarding the conclusionof the Pacific Agreement,The Cabinet agreedThat the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be requested to send to Mr. Balfour in their name a message of congratulation, couched in suitable terms, on the successful issue of hislabours at the Washington Conference.2.    The Cabinet had before them a draft of theKing&apos;s speech for the opening of Parliament onWednesday, 14th December, 1921, (CP.3543 Revised)and a draft of the address in reply.The Cabinet -(1) Approved the draft of the King&apos;sspeech as amended and agreed toits submission to His Majesty.(See Appendix I).(2) Approved the Address in reply tothe King&apos;s Speech. (See Appendix II )63.    Some discussion took place as to the legislation which it would be necessary to pass in the forthcoming session, and as to the desirability of including inthe speech the words &quot;No other business will bebrought before you in the present Session&quot;.The Cabinet were informed that in the opinionof the Committee on Irish Finance (established by cabinet 91 (21) Conclusion 5 ) which had just held ameeting, there were two subjects which would requireurgently to be dealt with presumably by legislation.Firstly, there was the position of those persons whohad been engaged in operating Martial Law in Ireland,and who would, unless an Act of Indemnity were passed,be open to attack from many quarters, and secondly,
1.1there was the situatd^rL^^ the provisionsof Article 17 of the Articles ?f Agreement.     ThisArticle provided for the establishment of a provisionalGovernment.     The only way in which such a Governmentcould operate would be through the machinery of theAct of 1920, but this would involve the taking of the &apos;oath of allegiance by Irish Ministers in the usualform, a form to which the Irish Delegates IJad objected.Unless the machinery provided by Section 72 of theAct of 1920 were used, the Irish Government would be strictly bound by appropriations of the british parliament.     They would be able to collect only   suchtaxes as had been imposed by the British Parliament,and spend the proceeds only in the way parliament had directed.     They would thus lose all popularsupport in Ireland.     It might be possible to devisesome method which would enable Irish Ministers toassume effice after taking the oath of allegiancein the form prescribed by the Articles of Agreementbut the other difAcuities could not, in the opinionof the Committee on Irish Finance (who, however, hadnot had the benefit of the advice of the LordChancellor) be surmounted without legislation.Strogn objection was raised to the. introductionof any business other than that necessary for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement.THE LORD CHANCELLOR, who arrived at thisstage, informed the Cabinet that there were only twocourses; to proceed by way of the Act of 1920, or topass legislation..     A strict interpretation of Section72 of the Act of 1920 would necessitate -che membersof the Provisional Government being appointed PrivyCouncillors, and taking one oath,     To proceed under existing arrangements without relying upon the powers
conferred by the Act of 1920 would restrict the newIrish Government to existing financial appropriations,inapplicable to the conditions in whioh they wouldbe situated and the Irish ?Unisters would find theyhad not a free hand.The Cabinet, however, were of opinion that itwould be exceedingly difficult to pass any legislation in the short parliamentary time avaliable.On a general review of the position, the LORDCHANCELLOR was of opinion that it would be possibleto hold that in view of the ratification of theArticles of Agreement by the British ParliamentSection 72 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920,must be construed In the light of the Articles ofAgreement and the provisions of the Act must be interpreted in conformity with the provisions ofthat Agreement.in the course of the above discussion, emphasiswas laid on the fact that it would not be possibleto establish a Provisional Government In Ireland ashad been suggested, in a few days time that theundertaking to do so &quot;forthwith&quot; which had been givenby the British Government in Article 17 of the Articlesof Agreement would be adequately fulfilled If, so soonas the Agreement had been ratified, the Delegates weresummoned from Ireland for the purpose of arranging forthe transfer of powers, and discussing the ^any points of difficulty which existed; and that it wouldbe Impossible to set up a provisional Government for at least a month.     The view was held that It wouldbe possible, with the goodwill of the Sinn Feinleaders, to continue the Government of Ireland under existing arrangements for some six weeks.
The Cabinet accordingly agreed(1)   That steps should be taken toestablish a Provisional Governmentin Ireland under Section 72 of theGovernment of Ireland Act, 1920, as modified by the Articles of Agreementwith the Irish Delegates, to the extent that the members of the IrishGovernment should be required underthe terms of Article 17 of the Agreement,to signify in writing their acceptanceof that instrument, but should not berequired to be Privy Councillors as provided by Section 72 of the Act of1920J(2)   That the Prime Minister should considerthe advisability of including in his speech, a statement that the government proposed as soon as possible to beginnegotiations with the Irish Delegatesincidental to the transfer of powers toa Provisional Government,4. The Cabinet then heard the opinion of the LORDCHANCELLOR on the question whether it was essentialimmediately to pass an Act of Indemnity to protectsoldiers and others who had done acts under the authorityof martial law which, apart from the existence of astate of martial law, would render them liable to proceedings in the Civil Courts.THE LORD CHANCELLOR stated that it was theconstitutional practice to pass an Act of Indemnity so soon p.s a state of martial law was brought to an end and that the position of soldiers and police would necessarily be insecure until this had been done.The Cabinet were reminded on the other handthat there wasno question that an Act of Indemnity wouldhave to be passed.     It was merely a question ofproviding an effective opportunity of doing so.     the short time during which Parliament would be sittingwould make it impossible until the New Year.Attention was drawn to the claim which would undoubtedly be pressed by the Sinn PeinfSrs, that an act of Indemnity shotild not be passed unless it were accompanied/
accompanied by an Act of Amnes^y-for&apos; all&quot; prisoners *Attention was also drawn to the fact that the criticsof the policy of the Government in Ireland during thelast year in Its efforts to maintain law and order,would undoubtedly oppose the passage of an Act ofIndemnity, and legislation could not be secured without some expenditure of Parliamentary time.It was pointed out that In view of the legalvacation, no effective proceedings could be taken inIreland, for acts done under Martial Law, other thanthe initial stages before a magistrate.     On the otherhand It was pointed out that it was desirable to observe the uniform practice which had prevailed whenevera state of martial Law had been abrogated, viz: that steps were immediately taken to protect soldiers whohad acted in accordance with the provisions laid downin the Manual of Military Law, and that not merely onaccount of the position in Ireland, but by reason ofthe necessity from time to time of declaring martial law in different parts of the Empire.It was agreed, however, that failing the immedi-ate passage of legislation a prominent statement inthe Speeches by the Prime Minister In the House ofCommons and Lord Curzon in the House of Lords that an act of Indemnity would be passed at the earliest opportunity, should meet the difficulty.The Cabinet agreed :-That a Bill of Indemnity should notbe introduced in the forthcoming session of Parliament, but that thePrime Minister in the House of commons and Lord Curzon in the House of Lords,should state In the forefront cf theirspeeches that a Bill of Indemnity wouldbe presented to Parliament at theearliest opportunity for the protectionof those who had been administeringMartial Law.
5. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to theapprehension which existed in the ranks of the royal irish Constabulary in regard to the effect on thenof the Article s of Agreement,     They were pressing for the dlsbandment of the force.     Under Article 10of the Articles of Agreement it would be necessaryto disband those members of the Royal Irish Con-stabulary (7*000 in number) who had been recruitedduring the last two years, and for whom the BritishGovernment assumed responsibility for compensation orpensions.     The 6,000 men who had entered theConstabulary before the last two years were to bedealt with by the Government of the Irish FreeState,     They wished, however, to be compulsorilydisbanded on the same terms as would be accorded tomen recruited during the last two years, end it wassuggested that a tribunal should be set up to dealwith the compensation to be granted to these men,Tt was generally agreed that the government must assure just treatment to members of theRoyal Irish Constabulary?     No decision was, however,taken, on the question whether the whole of theForce should be compulsorily disbanded and theChief Secretary undertook to circulate a Memorandumon the subject.6, The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that Spain had recently revised hertari$T; /with the result that Spanish Import dutieshad been raised by over 100 per cent.     Strongprotests had been made to the Board of Trade bymanufacturers of textiles and woollens, but theonly means of retaliation would be either to raisethe duties on Spanish wines, which did not seem likely to be effective, or to impose a duty on theimportation of Spanish fruit.     The United Kingdom
i iii ii ill1 Si P   1v/a s the. great market-f&quot;or^Spani-s^the wisdom of the imposition of a duty on Spanishfruit was doubtful it was not unlikely that a threat to impose such a duty might have.the desired effect.The Cabinet adjourned the discussion to enable the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to examine the question in consultation with the Presidentof the Board of Trade.7.   With reference to Conclusion (3) of the Minutesof a Conference of Ministers held on November 24th,1921, the Cabinet were informed that it would he necessarythat orders should be issued not later than December 15th,if drafts from regiments in Ireland were to be allowedto proceed to India in accordance with the shippingarrangements made by the War Office *     It was generally agreed that in view of the conclusion of the Agreementwith the Irish Delegates the risk ir-.voa.ved in the despatchof drafts from Ireland to India was negligible, especially as the drafts will be given a month&apos;1 s leave beforesailing and would, therefore, be available until january 15th.The Cabinet agreed/,&apos;-That there was no objectionto the grant of leave to soldiers now stationed inIreland pending their &apos;departure on draft for India,So    The Cabinet took note of the following:-.(a) Conclusions of a Conference of ministers held 18th November, 1921, at 5.30 p,m,(i) Congratulations,(ii) Prince of Wales in India,(iii) Ireland,(iv) The Near Bast,(v) The Situation in Egypt,APPENDIX III,

With reference to Cabinet 87 (21),&apos;the&quot;PrimeMinister referred to the reply dated 17thNovember, 1921, which had been received from sir james Craig in connection with the Irishnegotiations, and to the Illness of Sir james craig announced in the Press.The Prime Minister read the reply which he proposed to send to Sir James Craig.The Conference gave their approval to the proposed reply.4.       With reference to Cabinet 84 (21),Conclusion 2, the Conference had before them thefollowing documents relating to the situationin the Near east note by the Secretary of State forWar covering Note by the Chief of theImperial   General Staff.  (C.P.3463).Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War.  (CP.3474).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs informed the Conference that he had only that&apos;afternoon received a reply from the FrenchGovernment to the British Note on this subject.On the reply in question, which was very long,pacific and courteous, depended the future ofthe Entente and it would require the most carefulconsideration.      In the meantime and until this reply/
reply could be translated, and circulated, he did not thinkany useful purpose would be served by discussing thesubject.It wss agreed ;-To postpone further consideration ofthe question until such time as ministers had had an opportunity of reading the reply from the French Government whichthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to have translatedand circulated.5.       With reference to Cfrbinet 86 (21), Conclusion 1,the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS called attentionthe the urgent importance of consIdering further thequestion of the Situation in Egypt and the negotiations with had been taking plare With the Egyptian Delegation,He reminded the Conference of the previous discussion which had taken place in the Cabinet on the two alternative proposals &apos;*A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; when it had been decided io adoptthe former, although he, personally, had been in favourof going a little further than his colleagues andadopting proposal &quot;B&quot;.     In consequence of this decisionAdly Pasha had been informed of the reply of the BritishGovernment, and the Egyptian Prime Minister had two dayspreviously, handed him a written reply which amounted toan absolute refusal to agree to any of the Cabinet&apos;terms.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then read to the Conference a note which he had prepared on the reply of the Egyptian Delegation to the proposals of His MajestylsGovernment, and which is given in Appendix 1*     Thesubstance of the cabinet&apos;s proposals had appeared in the&quot;Daily Herald&quot; and this had no doubt been communicatedto that paper by one of the Egyptian Delegation.     He wasto see Adly Pasha again on the following day and it wasthe present intention of the Delegation to leave london on Sunday, which would be tantamount to informing theworld/
I   iii 247world of the breakdoyra -of&quot; the negotiations.     this might, he thought, result in the creation of a.veryserious situation in Egypt.     Lord Allenby took the viewthat he would be able to cope with any situation thatmight arise, unless the Egyptian Army were disaffected,in which case he would require considerable reinforcements *A telegram had been received from Lord Allenby(Appendix IT), giving the views of some of his Adviserson the Cabinet&apos;s proposals)    and pointing out that theywere unanimously of opinion that these would be\uiacceptable and administrative chaos in Egypt wouldresult.      It might be said that the telegram conveyedthe frightened warning of people on the spot, but itappeared likely that we were on the vo;rge of a seriousnew emergency ih Egypt which might strain our-available resources to the utmost.      It remained to be seen what attitude the Press would take up, but it was doubtful if the Governmentxs policy would be supported.      It was essential that the Cabinet should realise the seriousness of the situation.In the subsequent discussion which took place itwas suggested    that the only way of dealing with a serious situation such as that which had arisen   was by ensuring that departmental officials took great care when draftingtelegrams to give in full the arguments which had ledHis Majesty&apos;s Government to arrive at their decisions.It was pointed out that the Sultan had wanted to adjourn the negotiations, and that possibly this would have been thebest way of softening the blow.     Moreover, if a finaldecision had been postponed Zaghlul might have beendeported in the meantime.     Attentionms called to thefact that the Press had not been fully instructed inthe situation and that from the telegrams which had beenreceived it did not appear likely that the egyptians would accept proposal ttB&quot; any more than proposal &apos;\Af?,and that the only way of settling the matter was to adhere to/
to a policy of firmness^and&apos; -adroitness,&apos;rhe Secretary of State for India thought it extremely desirable  that if possible something shouldbe done to gain time as the breakdown of the negotiations would be most unfortunate.     Prom what had taken placehe thought it was evident that neither proposals wouldbe acceptable to the Egyptians.      It appeared to him that we were adhering to no clear principles and he thoughtthat it was necessary to draw a clear distinction betweenany action taken in the interests of the British empire which could not be abandoned and any action of abenevolent and paternal kind taken for the good of Egypt,e.g. Judicialnnd Financial Commissioners, which mightbe abandoned if the Egyptians desired.     He suggested thatat the same time the  solution might lie in the Egyptiansbeing given self-government and being told at the sametime that the Army must remain there for the protectionof British interests.      Such a decision might be softenedby saying that the location of the garrisons would befurther considered in a few years&apos; time when it was possibleto see how the now arrangements \vorked.It was suggested that ^ord Allenby had failedto convey clearly to his Advisers the decision arrivedat by the Cabinet and the reasons which had led tothe decision being come to,  and it was asked whether there was not room for further explanation to those concerned of what had happened.Attention was called to some criticisms which hadbeen recently made of the treatment of Egyptians byEnglishmen in Egypt, and how an unfavourable compsrisonhad been drawn between the way in which the english and French treated the people in the territories whichthey administered.,     Emphasis was laid on tho fact thatif/
If the Government were weak in-dealing with the Egyptiansituation, they were not fit to run a great Empire,and attention was called to the success with whichthe French administered Algeria and even Moroccojand kept the inhabitants contented without even goingso far as the Go,pinet wore prepared to go in the caseof Egypt, and further,  that the French were ableto raise in those territories large bodies of   troops to fight for France.Some discussion ensued as to the situationwhich might arise in tho immediate future, and the atti-tude of the Press at home, pending such time as theCabinet^ explanation could roach Egypt.      It was argued that there was noreason to bo afraid of any criticismswhich might be made by the ^ress on the Cabinet&apos;s proposals and that if anything they might be criticised for goingtoo far.      It was pointed out that public opinion inEngland would veer round very considerably when it was known what the Cabinet had offered.Views were expressed as to the steps which shouldbe taken to interview representatives of the Press orto issue a communique, and it was agreed --^hat the   Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in consultation with the prime minister should
Whitehall Gardens, S.W.19th November, 1921.(a) Prepare for despatch to Lord Allenby, for communication to the Sultan a note containing afull explanation and defence of the position whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government have assumed.(b) Prepare a communiqxie to the Press statingthat the publication of the proposals of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the reply of the egyptian delegation will take place shortly and thatpremature or piecemeal disclosures in the interimshould be discredited,(c) Inform. Lord Allenby by telegraph! that a copyof proposed agreement has been forwarded to him and would no doubt be forwarded by Adly Pasha tothe Sultan, and that in the course of a day ortwo a note for communication to the Sultan containing a full explanation and defence of the position whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government have assumed would be forwarded and that It was then proposed that thedraft agreement together with the note and the reply of the Egyptian Delegation should be publishedsimultaneously in both countries.
A P P E J DM. I.EGYPTIAN    NEGOTIATIONS.NOTE en the Reply of the Egyptian Delegation to the Proposalsof His Majesty^ Government.AD1Y PASHA called upon rae yesterday at the Foreign office in order to hand to mo the reply of the Egyptian delegation totka prepo-sals of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to thefuture of Egypt.As I had warned the Cabinet, his reply, which was a typedpaper of several pages, was a categorical and uncompromisingrefusal, which hesooompanied by an expression of profoundregret that exceut in the single particular of foreign represent-sentation fa concession which was materially qualified by the-conditions attached to it) His Majesty1^ Government had not,as he alleged, advanced a single step towards tha acceptanceof-the views which he and his colhagues had spent so many months in urging upon me at the Foreign Office.I expressed my sincere regret that our discussions, whichhad been conducted with so much good humour and good faith on both sides, had not had a more successful termination, and Iwas particularly sorry to read the words in the concluding paper of the Egyptian reply, which seemed to me of a need-lessly unqualified description.     But I did not attempt toreargue the ease, nor did I suggest that in any way it should or could now be reopened.There were two questions, howevex&quot;,  of some importance onwhich, I said.) L  was desirable to be clear.     Was I to regard the reply handed to me by the Minister as the provisionalrefusal of the delegation, subject to confirmation by the sultan and the Egyptian Ministry, when Adly Pasha had returned
to Cairo, or was I to take this document as the final and definite refusal of the Egyptian Government as a whole?     I felt it neoessary to ask the question, because it was the sultan who had, I believed, originally suggested the delegation;it was to him that the pledge that it should be reoeived hadbeen given;    it was he who had selected its members; ana I didnot quite see how the negotiations could be terminated without reference to him.     Accordingly, I ssked whether the text ofthe reply had been comoronicated to the Sultan, whether he approved of it, and whether the act of the delegation was alsothe aot of the Sovereign.Adly Pasha was, I think, a lit 1 le embarrassed by thesequestions, and had somewhat reluctantly to admit that, while the sultan was aware of what was being cone, he had neither seen the text of the answer nor had exprossed approval of its con-tents.     I more than once put the question &quot;Knowledge orapproval?&quot;   - to which the Pasha xaplied &quot;Knowledge, yes&quot;  but beyond that , silence.     He claimed, however, full powers for himself as Prime Minister and ulenipotentiary to decide onhis own responsibility.Wanting to know -hat his Excellency proposed to do, I asked whether he would not esteem it a part of his duty toreturn and present the reply of the delegation to the Sitltanpersonally.To this he replied in tho affirmative, thus apparentlysettling the question of his return to Egypt without immediateresignation.     He thought, he said, of leaving London at theend of the week, and of going to Paris, where he would pickup hie family, on his way back to Egypt.These considerations brought me to my second point, viz.,publication.      Both parties were, I thought,  concerned thatthere should not be premature,  or piecemeal, or unofficialdivulgation./- 2 - &apos;   *
9  J ddivulgation.     From the Egyptian point of view, I thought itwould be unfair and discourteous to publish without referenceto the Sultan   besides whioh publication in the absence ofAdly Pasha might prejudice his actions when he returned, andmight give rise to Saghlul demonstrations, which he would notbe there to deal with.     Further, publication in Egypt of thefull text of both documents was impossible until the.texts hadh&apos;-.\d time to arrive.     On the other hand, we in England were under a pledge to take no decision without previously sub-mitting our proposals to Parliament; and although this did not strictly apply to draft proposals which had been put forwardsubject to this condition, which had now been definitelyrejected, yet we must be careful as to the exact conditions under whioh publication in this country should take place.Gould the Minister,  I asked, guarantee that his colleagues would not  communicate in the interim to the press, and would hesee them immediately on his return to his hotel, and pledgethem to secrecy, until a decision, upon which I should liketo consult the Prime Minister, was arrived at?This he undertook to do, stating that as there were only two copies of the draft agreement in existence, both in his possession, -and both under lock and key, it   as impossible forthe text to be divulged.     Whether his colleagues will demistfrom talking is much more doubtful,  and, I should say, from such knowledge as I possess of the Oriental character, most unlikely.     Nevertheless, he agreed that it would be best to defer publication until he had returned to Cairo and presentedboth the draft proposals and his reply to the Sultan.I said that if that could be arranger., I though thatsimultaneous publication in this country and in Egypt was desirable, in order that neither partv mightt so to speak,steal a march on the ether.      In publishing we should statsth- t these were the proposals which had. been made by HisMajesty&apos;s/
Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to the approval of Parliament,if they had met with a favourable reception from the egyptian government.I then seunded the Minister on a third point.     I did not desire to press him, but could ho tell me how the decisionarrived at would affect his    ersonal position when he returnedto Cairo, and whether we might hope for his continued co-operation       to which Eis major sty&apos;s Government attached thehighest importance in carrying on tae Egyptian Administration?His Excellency did not give an absrlutely definite reply tothese questions, which were put wi.;h less precision than they appear to present in print;    but he left on me the very clearimpression that his present ii^ention is to resign immediately upon returning to Egypt, an--  that his position under any other conditions would beustenablu.      I said that I would consult thePrime Minister as to the des .rability of deferring publicationuntil hin return5  and then p:*cviding for a simultaneous issue,and would let him know of the  c personally or by letter beforothe end of the week.

Unless His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to givesubstantial satisfaction to expectations which Egyptianshave legitimately formed on the basis of apparent(.? policy of)    His Majesty&apos;s Government during the past two years, it will be impossible to form any Ministry.This will sooner or later lead to strike.3 or organisedobstruction among Government officials and in such an event police and probably army would side with themajority.      Strong military force acting with severitycould doubtless preserve certain measure of security .to life and property in larger cities, but the task would be a much more difficult one in the provinces.No military administration however could hope toreplace the complicated machinery of civil Government orprevent serious injury to financial and economic interests.     The Advisers have been carrying on over two years in the belief that policy of liberal con-cessions would be adopted and have undoubtedly giventhis impression to various Ministers and others with whom they have been in contact;,     They feel boundtherefore to point out that if a contrary policy Is(? adopted) they cannot expect to retain, the con-,fidence of Egyptian Ministers or be able to renderuseful service in the fixture.      If on the other handa liberal programme is approved by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, they are confident that it could beelaborated on the spot and a Ministry formed to carry it out even if no Egyptian Minister is prepared to-*day to sign official convention containing that programme as full satisfaction of Egyptian claims^

Telegram from Mr Balfour, Washington, No.28 of November 17th, 1921.

10th Minutes of Standing Sub-Committee of Committee of Imperial Defence, dated October 14th, 1921.

?

It was explained that the matter had been put down for discussion in consequence of the receipt from Mr. Balfour of the telegram dated November 17th, 1921, and in view of the fact that the Geddes Committee were taking special interest in the possibility of cutting down expenditure by reducing the strengths of British naval and military garrisons, oversea.

During the discussion which ensued it was suggested that if any naval or military forces were maintained at Wei-hai-Wei it was not for the protection of that place, but as a matter of convenience, and that in view cf the situation in North China it was essential to keep a certain number of troops in that part of the world, apart altogether from the fact that in the future Wei-hai-Wei might be developed as a useful naval base. At the same time it was pointed out that under existing conditions Wei-hai-Wei had no strategical importance. The conditions under which Wei-hai-Wei had been originally leased to Great Britain were explained to the Conference, and it was pointed out that it would be no breach of faith if Great Britain still retained Wei-hai-Wei as Japan had simply replaced Russia in Port Arthur.

Attention was called to the fact that in the past Great Britain had surrendered territory which was greatly regretted afterwards, viz: Heligoland, Corfu and Java, and it was suggested that in no circumstances should His Majesty&apos;s Government agree to give up any territory
territory without knowing what they were going to get in return and. what the other Powers represented atWashington were ready to do.     Emphasis was laid on theinexpediency of making any concessions to China so longas the country was in its existing chaotic position,and it was pointed out that in any case if any concessionswere made it should he as part of a general bargain, andthat in her present position it would be ridiculous to hand over anything to her as a gift.It was explained to the Conference that Mr. Balfourhad also raised the question of releasing China from herobligation to pay to Great Britain her share of the&quot;Boxer indemnity&quot; which amounted, to some  10,000,000.During the discussion which, ensued it was argued that there was no reason for Great Britain giving up 10,000,000 to which she was justly entitled.     As inthe case of V/ei-hai-Wel, it was contended that any concessions in connection with the indemnity should alsoonly be made as part of an all iroiuad bargain and with a stable Chinese Government..      It was further contended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should only agree to remittheir share of the Indemnity ont three conditionsj firstly,that there should be an all roiind remission j    secondly,that any remission at all shov.ld be dependent on theestablishment of a united and stable Government inChina3 and thirdly, that if ajnd when the British shareof the indemnity was remitted part of the money shouldbe spent on the education of $Chinese on British lines.Regarding the whole question of concession to Chinait
/ It was suggested that instructions should he sent   toX) Mr, Balfour saying that the British Delegation worenot, on their own, to raise the question of makingconcessions; that before any such concessionswere made it was essential to know what the otherPwoers proposed to doj   and further that while heshould be quite ready to discuss such questions no    *arrangement should be come to except on the condition that any concessions which were made should be made toa recuperated and reconstituted China,,It was agreedThat the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send atelegram to Mr0 Balfour on thelines of the discussion which hadtaken place.WASHINGTON       (2) In the course of the preceding discussionCONFERENCE.Naval Policy,reference was made to the views in regard to naval policy and particularly to submarines which werebeing expressed at WashingT.cn.The Conference agreed.That a further meeting of theCommittee of Imperial defence should be summoned to review the position.DRAFTS (3) The Secretary of State for War raised theFORINDIA. question of the despatch of drafts to India,     he explained to the Conference that in addition to somedrafts the men composing which were serving in Ireland,two Battalions were due to leave for India on the 1stand 3rd of December next.     It was necessary for theWar Office to get an early decision as to whether these battalions were to be sent or not, as otherwise it would upset the whole of the War Office arrangementsfor the reliefs to be carried &quot;out during the ensuing
trooping season and wo aid cost a lot of money.It was pointed out how inexpedient it would be under existing conditions to take away troops from ireland as drafts for India, and at the same time itwas explained to the Conference that tho two Battalionswhich it was proposed to send abroad were not atpresent in Ireland, and that their despatch would notin any way affect the strength of the Irish garrisonexcept in so far as these formations were potentialreserves tor the reinforcement of that garrison.It wS3 agreed -That the two regiments should be despatched as arranged cn the 1stand 3rd lacoicber next? but thatthe drafts should be held up pend-ing the Secretary of StatG for Indiacommunicating with the Viceroy onthe subject.PROCEDURE IN      (4) The Prims Minister sailed the attention of theCOMMON I CAT IN Gv:m THE BRITISH Conference to a telegram watch had been sent direct fromSLEGATION at as RING TON.        the Board of Trade to Sir Hubs rt Llewellyn Smith atWashington, and to a letter from the Secretary of St^tefor Foreign Affairs to the Aoting Secretary, Cabinetin connection therowith.It was pointed out how undesirable it wa3 for any single department to e^nimunioate direct with theirrepresentatives at Washington, and especially on matters which were under consideration by Cabinet Committees orthe Committee of Imperial Defenoe, and emphasis was laid on the importance of all messages sent to Mr.Balfour, or sent by Mr, Balfaar to His Majesty^ Governmentpassing through either the Foreign Office or tho cabinet secretariat, who should be-held responsible for seeing that they were properly dealt with.
It was agreed -(a) That the Acting Secretary to theCabinet skoals arrange with theSeeretary of State for ForeignAffairs ae to whether the ForeignOffice or the Oat)inst Seeretariatshettld be the responsible Department.(b) That the necessary instructionsah cold be issued to the British -Delegation at Washington and to the      rDepartments in London to ensure that vin future all massages to and from washington are sent through the4iD     She Secretary- of State for India read atelegmaJTrom tho-Oorernor of Bombay describing the remarkable reception aoooraeCJLn.India to the Prince of wales, the personal -triomph of His Rey&amp;l Highness anapopular manifestations of loyalty exceeding allospeotations.WM) Qoafs^&amp;aQO hci:z?&amp; tho sewo -with p^foaaigratification and asked the Secretary ofState to arrangetfor^the-publiOatijen of the telegram.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.24th Hoi^ember, 1921,

Ho worth, Assistant Secretary, Cabinet.Future of theSupply and Trans-port Organisation.With reference to Cabinet 10 (21), Conclusion 6, the Committeehad under consideration a Memorandum by the Chairman of theSupply and Transport Committee, OP. 3308, together withMemoranda by the President of the Board of Trade, CP. 3433,and by the Chief Civil Commissioner, CP. 3343, on the questionwhether a skeleton organisation should be continued for ensuringadequate supplies and distribution of foodstuffs, and means oflocomotion, during any period when the ordinary resources of thecountry are dislocated by reason of industrial disturbances.The matter had been referred by the Lord. Privy Seal, with theconsent of the Prime Minister, to the Home Affairs Committee, for final settlement.
It appeared that the Cabinet had directed, in March 1921, thatthe expenditure for the financial year was not to exceed  64,000,and that the whole question should be reconsidered in the autumn.In the Memorandum by the Chairman of the Supply andTransport Committee the undoubted advantages of the supplyand transport organisation were reviewed, the estimated cost of continuing the skeleton organisation being put at  55,320 per annum.But, in Sir Eric Geddes&apos;s opinion, the time had now come to disbandthe whole system on the ground that it was unwise that the nationshould continue in the habit of looking to the Government fordirection and initiative in the matter. During, and immediatelyafter, the war the Government had been the only body with sufficient strength to oppose the great industrial organisations, butthat had now passed and private initiative had reasserted itself.Industrial trouble was unlikely in the immediate future, but, on theother hand, Government machinery and expenditure of every kindwere subject to fierce criticism.In the Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade itwas agreed that the organisation of that Department for foodtransport in an emergency should be disbanded. The Board of trade had only acquiesced in the retention of the nucleus staff for thepurpose, in deference to the Cabinet&apos;s decision referred to above.One month&apos;s notice would be necessary to terminate engagementsand this should be given on the 1st December.It was -suggested in the Memorandum by the Chief civil commissioner that the Civil Commissioners and the Supply Depart-ment should continue, which involved the retention of the Chairmen ofVolunteer Service Committees all over the country. The annual cost,which had previously been estimated at  400, was not likely to reachthat sum. All the officials concerned were engaged in ordinary timeson the normal work of their Departments, and no expense wastherefore incurred in that direction.The Committee also had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary for Scotland handed round at the Meeting, CP. 3516, inwhich general concurrence was expressed with the view of the ChiefCivil Commissioner that the Supply Department and the correspondingorganisations for Scotland should be retained. Attention was drawn to the fact that the situation was not such as to justify the belief&apos; that industrial trouble could be ruled out during the next few years.Reference was also made to the face that in Scotland many of thelocal authorities, owing to political considerations, were unable tomake any preparations in advance, though they would act in anemergency when they would be assured of the active support of thecommunity.The Committee were impressed with the value of the organisa-tion represented by the Civil Commissioners and, the supply department. They were informed by the Chief Civil Commissionerthat, except during an emergency, the only accommodation required was two rooms in Whitehall Gardens. It appeared that if theorganisation were disbanded it would take a long time in a futureemergency to collect men to serve as chairmen of volunteer com-mittees, and much valuable time and experience would be lost.On the other hand, if the organisation were kept in being it wouldbe possible to maintain touch with Local Authorities and thevarious voluntary chairmen and to fill in vacancies as and when theyoccurred, so as to secure that in the event of an emergency arisingthe machinery to deal with it would be available. It also appeared that the Civil Commissioners as a body were anxious that theorganisation should be kept going, and the volunteer chairmen were willing to continue to serve, even although there might be no call upon them.The Committee accordingly agreed that the Civil Commis-sioners and the Supply Department, and the corresponding organisa-
tions in Scotland, the cost of all of which was understood to benominal, should be retained.The President of the Board of Trade suggested to theCommittee that on the general question whether the skeletonorganisation in the Food Department, and in other services, whichhad been retained with a view to their expansion in a suddenemergency, should now be disbanded, must depend to a large extentupon the risk which the Government were prepared to take. Byspending a certain sum of money the Government could be ready inan emergency after the lapse of so many days. If a smaller sumwere spent the time taken would be longer ; if more were spent upona more elaborate&apos; organisation a shorter time would be necessary.If, however, nothing were done at all and there was a sudden general strike, it might be impossible for the Government to improvise asystem in time to cope with the general dislocation which wouldensue. The cheapest possible form of organisation for the distribu-tion of food would cost , 14,000. It was true that they might reduce the scheme to one man as a nucleus, but in that event hewould require at least a month to prepare a scheme when anemergency arose.It was pointed out to the Committee that the powers of theBoard of Trade in respect of food control lasted only up to August1922, and that after that date their only powers would be under theEmergency Powers Act, which would not operate until an emergency1had been declared.The Financial Secretary to the Treasury suggested that the first question for decision was whether it was necessary at the moment totake any steps involving expenditure, having regard to the absenceof industrial unrest or of money to support strikes, and in view of thegeneral necessity for limiting national expenditure to the lowestpossible amount. Moreover, the sooner it was made plain to theLocal Authorities that they must recognise their own responsibilities,the sooner they would get used to the idea of shouldering the burdenthemselves.The Committee were generally agreed that the expenditure of so large a sum as  14,000 a year could not be contemplated, but theywere impressed with the value of having schemes prepared now whichcould be pigeon-holed and kept for use in a possible emergency.The Committee also attached importance to the continuance ofthe electricity branch and any other volunteer services which couldbe maintained in outline at a nominal cost.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transportreferred to the fact that it would be necessary that a cabinet minister should be appointed in place of Sir Eric Geddes, with thespecial duty of watching the industrial situation and with power tocall together the Supply and Transport Committee should occasionarise.The Committee were generally agreed that- this should bedone, and, pending further consideration of the matter, were ofopinion that the Home Secretary should act in this capacity adinterim.On a review of all the circumstances, the Committee came tothe conclusion that it was desirable that schemes should be preparedfor use in an emergency and that officials should be allocated in theDepartments concerned to serve as the bare nucleus of an emergency organisation, but that the total cost of such nucleus must not exceed 2,000 per annum.The Committee accordingly agreed 1. That the skeleton of the Supply and Transport organisation,the continuance of which had been authorised by theCabinet, should be disbanded.2. That the President of the Board of Trade should beauthorised    to   give   one   month&apos;s   notice   on   the
1st December to the special staff&apos; retained in the FoodDepartment.   C^^^^t^^^^t^^, (^^y^^Aths.3. That the $fes- ^Sffiee^be requested forthwith to discontinuetheir scheme for wireless communication.4. That the organisation of the Civil Commissioners and theSupply Department and the corresponding organisations for Scotland should be retained.5. To request the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofTransport to convene the Executive Sub-Committee ofthe Supply and Transport Committee for the followingpurposes :--(a.) To draw up a scheme which could be carriedout in the event of an emergency arising.(b.) To recommend the nucleus organisation to beretained at a cost not exceeding  2^000 perannum, including any expenses arising inconnection with the Civil Commissioners andthe Supply Department.6. That the President of the Board of Trade, notwithstanding above, be authorised to retain until the end of thefinancial year such of the special staff of the FoodDepartment as might be required to prepare the schemefor use in an emergency referred to in 5.7. That the Home Secretary, pending farther consideration ofthe matter, should be responsible for watching theindustrial situation and calling together the Supply andTransport Committee should occasion arise.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.

THE PRIWr rj-KlSTEIVjefBrrtng to Cabinet 90 (21)Conclusion (2), stated that It was advisable to mark theState Opening of Parliament in connection with the IrishAgreement by some special ceremonial?   he suggested thatit would be most suitable for the regiments of Guards-ef all four countries and their massed bands to be closely ass-doiated in the military display.It was suggested that the massed bands of theGuards, together with their massed colours should headthe King!s procession;   but it was pointed out that itwould be unsuitable for dismounted bands to head amounted procession and further that the massed bandswould prevent the crowds frem cheering.The Military Authorities pointed out that the actualspace required for massed bands was very considerable and that accordingly certain arrangements&quot; which might otherwise be most suitable could not be carried out.Various suggestions were then discussed, from whichit appeared that the Guards without recalling men onfurlough could, If units stationed out of London were moved up for the purpose, provide some 5,000 men, andthat this would cost about  1,200.It was agreed, subject to the approval of H0M.the King:-(1)   That all units of the Guards should take part in the ceremonial, the units stationedout of London being moved up for the purpose,(2)   That one of the English Battalions ef Guardsshould provide a Guard of Honour and bandat Buckingham Palace.(3) That Guards of Honour and massed bandsprovided by the Grenadier, Coldstream,Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards, with a King&apos;s
colour for each regiment should marchtwenty minutes before the King&apos;s pro-cession starts via the Mall^ the HorseGuards Arch, Whitehall, and take up aposition at the Victoria Tower where thehands should be able to play In unison andthe Guards of Honour be as close to eachother as the available space admitted.(4)   That the King^ procession should proceedvia the Horse Guards Arch and Whitehall,that it should be headed by a regimentof Household Cavalry and that anotherregiment of Household Cavalry should bring up the rear of the column.     Oneband of the Household Cavalry should accompany the procession, the other two to be stationed at suitable points on the route*(5)   That the First Commissioner of works should arrange for all public buildingsto fly flags and to make use of suchbunting as they have, but that poles forbunting Should not be erected.(6)   That the&apos;First Commissioner of works should communicate immediately withthe Lord Great Chamberlain to ascertain what arrangements should be made in theRoyal Gallery and other parts of theHouse of Lords,
