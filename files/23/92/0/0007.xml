Of)-!ITALY. The Cabinet met once more as a matter of urgencyHeist ions to resume consideration of the question of relationswith.with Italy, which had. been under discussion at the(Previous whole of the Meeting referred to in the margin.Reference:Cabinet 5 The Prime Minister reported that shortly before(38) .the Meeting of the Cabinet he had heard that the ItalianGovernment were going to accept the British formula onKRjokfAthe withdrawal of volunteers from Spain.At 4.4^ p.m. there was an adjournment, during whichthe following Ministers met informally with a view to finding a solution of the difficulties th?t had. arisen:-The Prime Minister,mhe Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence,The President of the Board       Trade.The Minister of Agriculture a.ndFisheries.At 6.10 p.m. the Cabinet, who had. not left thebuilding, re-assembled.   They were informed thatduring the informal meeting a suggestion had been made that when the Prime Minister and. Foreign Secretary saw the Italian Ambassador on the following day they shouldmake a statement to the following e^eect:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;? Government are enthusiasticallyin favour of conversations.   They attach somuch importance to them that they would have preferred a longer time for preparation.If this, however, was liable to be misunder-stood, in Italy, they were willing to announcean early start.   They felt, however, thatt&amp;ey must make plain that, an agreement onSpain must, form an integral part of thefinal arrangement and that no agreementeoulr1 be rea.ched without it.   Moreover, thequestion of Abyssinia, involved the League ofNations, an^ it was hopeless to try and obtain the agreement of the League without^eing able to announce publicly that, theItalians were in fact co-operating overSpain&quot;.The Ministers eoncerne^ har&quot; felt that the adoption ofthat course, in conjunction with Italian agreement tothe British formula for withdrawal of volunteers from
o o 9(j ti &amp;Spain, should ease the situation for the foreign secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that he had understoodthat the above proposal depended upon the italian ambassador confirming officially the informationalready received on the subject of the British formula.The Prime Minister agreed.The Foreipm Secretary asked for a little time toconsider this proposal.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To adjourn in order to give the foreign secretary an opportunity to consider theformula proposed by the Lord Presidentof the Council and reproduced, above:(b) That the following Ministerss namely.The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Minister fo^ Co-ordination ofDefence,The President of the Board of Trade,,mhe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,should, re-assemble at Downing Street at.^0 p.m, to hear the decision of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,and, on behalf of the Cabinet, to makeany further observations to him that theymight think desirable:( c) That the Secretary should be instructedto attend the meeting at 7,30 p.m. andto inform the Cabinet by written noticeof the result,x-x MOTE. The latter decision was notcarried, out because, as aresult of the 7 o30 meeting,the Prime Minister decidedto re-assemble the cabinet at 10 pciru2, Whitehall Gardens, S.-V.1,20th February, 1938.

ITALY. The Prime Minister asked the Foreign SecretaryRelations with,    to state his position after the time he had had forreflection.(previous reference: The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidCabinet 6(38). that he was grateful for the opportunity afforded forreflection.   He also thanked the Prime Minister forseeing him the same morning.   His conclusion as to the merits of the position was that he had nothing to add.All the facts were before the Cabinet.   He could not recommend to Parliament a policy with which he was notin agreement.   He could not disguise,, also, that therewas a difference of outlook on foreign affairs general-ly between himself and some of his colleagues, includingthe Prime Minister.   As an example he mentioned the message sent to President Roosevelt at the beginning ofthe yesr.   He felt a.lso that some of his  colleaguesthought that opportunities for improving relations with italy and Germany had been missedo    The Cabinet had before, them a number of very difficult decisions in thefield of foreign affairs, especially in Central Europe.It might, be that he and they would not see eye to eye.He himself thought, for example, that our offers inthe colonial sphere ought to be modified, by what had.happened, in Austria,    &quot;&quot;here were other instances alsowhich he coul^ quote if necessary-   He thought,therefore, that the best thing for the Cabinet and.for the country was to have a. Foreign Secretary withwrhom the Prime Minister and his colleagues would, seeeye to eye.   He thanked his colleagues for the yearsof close co-operation, and expressed the hope that hewould not be an embarrassment to them outside.The Prime Minister said that every member of theCabinet, was touched and. grieved, at what, the foreign secretary ha.^ said.   He was sure that every member
o o rr6 fc. would have done anything possible to reconcile suchdifferences as existed.    The Foreign Secretary hadcorne to discuss the matter with him that morning.mhey had found, with deep regret, that the course hiscolleague proposed was the right one.   His opinionarose out of a conclusion to which he had only recently come, namely, that the difficulties were notmerely of time and method, hut of deeper outlook.   a difference on methods and timing would not havemerited a. severance:    hut if the differences were deepit was no use trying to patch up on the particularissue of method and time that had been under consider-at ion.   He had given careful consideration to the ideaof an attempt to slur over the present, difficulty andto postpone resignation until a more favourable moment.But even if the Foreign Secretary was willing toconsider this idea it was hardly fair to the Cabinet.Tt was no use asking him to pretend that there were no real difficulties.   He could not say how much he hatedlosing a colleague to whom he was devoted and with whom he had never had a. cross word, but he feared, it was inevitable.The President of the Board of Trade said that the statements made had come as a complete shock to theCabinet.    On the previous day he had thought they werediscussing a point on which he and. some of hiscolleagues had taken a. different view from the foreign secretary.    They were told now that the differencebetween the Foreign Secretary and the Cabinet, was ofa fundamental kind.    If that was the case he felt bound, to say that although he had disagreed, with theForeign Secretary on the previous day, he had inforeign affairs generally been a whole-hearted supporter
c)    r*h 0of his policy.    Tf the new state of affairs meant that those who remarkable.ined in the Cabinet were tied to adifferent policy from that of the Foreign Secretaryit create^ a difficult situation,:The Lord. President o^&quot; the Council also shared, theview of the President, of the Board of Trade to someextent,    In view of what the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary had said, so far as their position was affected there was nothing more to be said..,    put this involved wider considerations.    *Vhat did these differences in fact amount to?    The Foreign secretary had spoken of Central Europe.    The Cabinet had. not yeteven discussed that matter.    It placed the wholeCabinet in a great difficulty, if this formidablesituation was to be created out of a difference overmethod and timing.    On what ground could the foreign secretary explain the situation publicly?   He could,not base his resignation on questions that had notbeen before the Cabinet,   A few days ago everyone hadbeen agreed on the desirability of conversations with italy an&apos;9 Germany.   The details depended a goofl deal on what happened as the result of Count Gra.ndi&apos;s visit on^he morrow.   Yet resignation would result in a rever-ber^tion throughout, the world.The Secretary of State for Scotland, said that thiswas an entirely new situation.    On the previous day he had agreed that, in view of past difficulties, itwas not easy not to go on with the conversations.Put now a fundamental difference of policy was alleged.The Prime Minister said that he was not surprised,that his colleagues should speak in that manner.He would try and. explain the situation and he hoped,the Foreign Secretary would correct him if he made any
&apos;; *, ^mistake.   What he meant by &quot;a fundamental difference of outlook&quot; was that the Foreign Secretary did not really agree in *he attempt to get on terms withGermany and Italy.   He had said, on the previous day that one thing that weighed with him was that Italy,who desired conversations, had in no way shown good will.He had instanced the holding up of the formula on Spainas a case in point.   Agreement on that would have been some indication of good will,    .Vhen asked, however,he had said that he would not *gree to the conversa-tions even if the Italian Government gave an assuranceon thai point,   He himself had just he^rd that theItalians were prepared to accept the British formula.The Foreign Secretary would say that that would notremove his objections to the conversationsc   He had got the impression that, the Foreign Secretary did. not want the conversations, or, to put it differently, thathe was much less convinced than he himself of the desir-ability of seizing on the present opportunity of conversations and. that he was prepared to postpone themeven at the risk of no further opportunity for themopening.    mhe Cabinet knew that in the ca.se of GermanySir Mevile Henderson had been instructed to sound. herr hitler as to the way various points were to be treated.He was to go over the main questions in Europe and to mention the colonies.   He was to make no offer, but merely to enquire whether th*t line of advance would be acceptable.   He gathered, that the Foreign Secretary nowthought that we ought not to go so far.    The difference was that he himself was very anxious to go ahead withconversations with Germany and. Italy, and the foreign secretary was less anxious.
O o n&amp; 6 jThe Foreign Secretary said that he could, not modify the line he had taken on the previous day.    On the general position the Prime Minister had a very strong view.   Thatwas true of himself also,    ^his was not the first occasion on which they ha.&apos;1&apos; differed.    They had frequentlyheld, views that did. not coincide.   For exa.mple, if it hadbeen sent to him first he would not have endorsed everyword of the letter the Prime Minister had sent to signor mussolini,    Tn the matter of President Roosevelt also he had. not liked, the reply sent by the Prime Ministerwhile he was away.    In that matter the Cabinet Committee&apos;on Foreign Policy had worked for five days for a compromise-mise-    Tt was more a matter o^ emphasis and. handling than of principle c   He believed, that his own method would obtain a result if he v/ere allowed, to carry it out.   Hiscolleagues ^id not agree.    It was necessary that theForeign Secretary should have the conviction tha.t he hadthe assent of the Cabinet.   He had. given three examplesand there was no reason to rive others .    It woul,* bebetter to have a Foreign Secretary who shared, the viewof the Prime Minister.    Tt was true that he and. the PrimeMinister ha^ always been able to agree in the end ondraft telegrams, despatches, an&apos;5 so forth, but they didnot always begin by agreeing, and in the recent questionthey had not agreed.The Prime Minis+er asked his colleagues to believethat there was no matter between him and the foreign secretary which was nev and undisclosed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer sair&quot; that he alsofelt rather disturbed, and surprised at the extent of theground of differences of opinion as stated, by the foreign secretary.   He had had. special opportunities to observethese matters, an^ he had never realised the width ofthe breach.    On the previous day the Cabinet had been
discussing a difference of method.   He had gathered theimpression that there was a slight difference, whichhe himself had described as a difference of timing.That might be too narrow a definition;    but if it hadbeen important yesterday not to proceed on the assump-tion of too narrow a difference, it was equally important today not to assume th^t it was too wide.It ought not to go out to the world, that there was a fundamental difference of opinion.   He had long admiredthe manner in which the Foreign Secretary had handled,an overwhelming task of extraordinary difficulty, but.he ha^ never recognised a.ny fundamental disagreement .He himself had been a. loyal supporter of the PrimeMinister also, bUt he had. not recognised, any fundamentaldifferences on foreign policy.    It was true that on thequestion of conversations with Italy differences had arisen as to the handling.   How these issues had blownup until they occupied the whole horizon.   But it wasnot true that there were fundamental differences onforeign policy.   He pointed out that foreign policy involved much wider considerations affecting all thenations of the world.   All these questions had beenhandled by the Foreign Secretary with a most, extraordin-ary application, devotion to duty and ability.    On thegreat mass of fordism policy issues there had been nodisagreement.    It was true there had. been differences,as well there might be, over handling that extraordinar-ily difficult personality Signor Mussolini,    &quot;^he lastword in this matter lay with the Foreign Secretary,but he asked him to remember that his decision might result not only in widespread regrets in the government but in rejoicing by Dictators and by the Opposition.
ci n A6 0 JAnd. above all, it was not true that there was a fundamental difference on policy.?he Secretary of State for India, speaking asa. member of the Cabinet who was not a member ofthe Foreign Policy Committee, asked what the PrimeMinister had meant when he had. suggested that therewas nothing which was not known to the Cabinet as tothese differences,&quot;&quot;he Prime Minister said that he had. been referring to the policy.    There was no matter of policy thatwas hidden from the members of the Cabinet.    Vhen hesaid that he was not referring to the differences.The policy had. not  changed.    It was only recently,however, that he himself had. realised the extent ofthe fundamental difference of outlook.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs repeated that the difficulties did not refer only to Italy,,     Hehad mentioned the communication to President Roosevelt,He had not thought that the original answer was correct- andhis view was that a mistake had been made.     He himself wouldhave recommended a different coixrseoThe Secretary of State for India said that the fact remained that what the Cabinet had just heard came as a greatshocks Tn spite of what the Chancellor of the Exchequer had said, there did seem to be fundamental differences betweenthe Foreign Secretary and the majority of his colleagues,,He himself had nearly always been of the same view as theForeign Secretary and he had never appreciated that so great a divergence in outlook was growing up between him and thePrime Minister     He was afraid that the resignation of theForeign Secretary at thi.--. juncture would have disastrouseffects at home and abroad,      It would be said that theCabinet was divided on the international situation and that itwas incapable of taking a strong lineo     At home the effect could only be most unfortunate,,      It was deplorable, therefore,that this resignation was impending,,     On the ether hand,he was in a better position than most people to realise the extraordinary difficulties that did arise if there was a difference between the Prime Minister and the ForeignSecretaryo      This had been brought home to him as the authorof the official biography of Lord Curzon, who had had acutedifferences with Mr. Lloyd George0The Foreign Secretary said he did not like the parallel.The Secretary of State for India continuing saidthat that episode illustrated the difficulties and dangers of a difference between the Prime Minister and the Foreign
(j o ftSecretary.     The Cabinet were, therefore, faced with a choice of evils.      If it was true that the difference was so great that it could not bo bridged then resignation wasthe only way out of the impasse. but he hoped that it wasnot even now too late to bridge the gap.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,referring to the difficulties of the past, said that he hadbeen throughout a member of the Cabinet Committee on ForeignAffairs.     There had, of course, often arisen differencesas to the form and style of some particular document,but in no case, of which he was aware, had these differencesgone beyond what must arise when a number of individualshad to reach agreement on a complicated question.      In histime on the Committee every question of that kind had beenhammered out and agreement had been reached.     Sometimesit might have resulted in a compromise, but the british people were given to compromise.     When a number of people met to consider such questions they often startedfrom a different point of view but arrived in the end atthe same point.     That was not a difference of principle.He had not been conscious of deep differences of opinionon matters of principle.     Even on the previous day, hehad not thought that there was any difference of principle,but only of method and time.     For his part, he would haveto say that the Foreign Secretary was wrong if he claimed that there were fundamental differences of opinion.     Hehad always found the Foreign Secretary extraordinarilyopen to suggestion.The Foreign Secretary said that it was not healone who had admitted the differences.   They were perhapsdifferences of outlook and approach and method of which hehad given two or three illustrations.     He and thePrime Minister could probably find others if theysearched.     He had, therefore, come to the conclusion
Cl     cj&amp;&apos;     0that the best service he could render to the State wouldbe to end this position of difference.     On the internationalside also he felt that if a change must be made, it had better come now rather than later.     Other differences would almost certainly arise and the circumstances would be more dangerous for resignation.     When he had met the PrimeMinister, the latter had used the same words as he himself had used on the previous evening to a colleague.The President of the Board of Education reminded the Foreign Secretary of a conversation that they had had at Geneva two years ago.     The Foreign Secretary had talkedof resignation because public opinion was not with him.His reply had been that what he needed was a holiday.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat on the previous day he had taken a line rather similarto that of the Foreign Secretary.     He had felt that therewas a diffdrence mainly of me thod and timing and not ofprinciple.     He agreed with the Secretary of State for india on this.     He, however, was a member of the Gommittee onForeign Affairs and he had been present with the foreign secretary at certain Conferences.     He himself was conscious of a difference of view between the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary on foreign policy and the handling ofcertain questions.     He was not even satisfied that theywere altogether agreed on principle.     Everyone in theCabinet wanted the conversations with Italy and withGermany.     He was not really certain, however, as towhether the Foreign Secretary agreed in the case of Italy.Even if there was agreement on them, he felt there wovedifferences of handling and method greater than ought to exist between a Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary.Any head of a Department would feel in great difficulties if
such differences existed, but they were   ten thousand timesgreater if they existed between a Foreign Secretary and his prime Minister,     If there was not close agreement betweenthem, the position was unfair to the Prime Minister? unfair to the Foreign Secretary, who was handling a huge and difficult mass of business, and unfair to the Government,He found it diffi.- ;.It to agree that the question could bepatched up.     He could see no other decision than that nowbeing proposed - a decision which would be fair to the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary, who were getting into an intolerable situation.     On fundamentalsf he agreed with thePrime Minister, but he ^thought this was truo of the foreign secretary also.     On the handling of the situation and on many questions of detail, he had agreed perhaps more withthe Foreign Secretary?    for example, on the question of thecummunication to President Roosevelt,     On the previous day,there had been great differencesP     On the question of central Europe, however, members of the Cabinet ought tohave an opportunity for discussion before anything was done.     As he agreed on fundamentals with the Prime Minister,he felt, so far as he himself was concerned,  that he was justified in remaining in the Cabinet,      In his two years as a Member of the Cabinet, he had been much impressed bythe extent of the co-operation between the Prime Minister,when he had been Chancellor of the Exchequer, and theForeign Secretary,     He deplored that this had broken down,though he felt that it was true that this was the case.
o ^ Ffft d jThe Secretary of State for the Colonies feared that a resignation would have far-reaching consequenceson the world outside, on the House of Commons and onthe political position in the country.    He could notdisguise from himself that it would be one of the mostserious events in the history of the post-war world.Looking back, he realised that Lord Baldwin had not taken much part in foreign affairs, which he had leftto his Foreign Secretary.    The Prime Minister, however,on becoming head of the Government, had exercised hisundoubted right to take a more initiating part in foreignaffairs.    The world had witnessed a decay in the powersof the League of Nations1 a: 1 in our ability to carry on success-fully on the lines of the country&apos;s post-war policy.The need had arisen at the cost of considerable risks to come to terms with one or other of the DictatorPowers and to jettison past policy.    Possibly, likehimself, Mr. Eden felt he could not go back on his past.He himself would have had to resign, but for the firmsupport of his colleagues.    Nevertheless, he had felt thatthis would not prevent him from co-operating with theGovernment in some other office    Foreign affairs were such a supremely vital matter that it was only possiblefor our constitution to work if there was absoluteagreement    between the Foreign Secretary and anyPrime Minister who took a leading part in foreign affairs as was his right.    There were only two possible methods,either, like the great Lord Salisbury, for the PrimeMinister to be Foreign Minister, or else for someoneto hold the office who was determined to put the PrimeMinister&apos;s policy through.    It might be indiscreet on his
OOP&amp; 0 Dpart, but he ventured to basic whether the foreign secretary&apos;s resignation and his replacement either bythe Prime Minister himself,  or by a colleague who sharedhis view, must necessarily involve the loss of his presence at the Cabinet Council.    Might it not be in theinterests of the Government that he should remain?Resignation would have such far-reaching results that every effort ought to be made to avoid it.    His ownParliamentary experience was necessarily coming to an endat the end of the present Session if not before.    looking to the future, in view of the regard in which the foreign secretary was held in the Cabinet, in Parliament and inthe country, he ought to remain a Member.    He himself hadnot always seen eye to eye with the Foreign Secretary,but he realised that he, like the Prime Minister, hadan enormous fallowing in the country.    The two of themoccupied a unique position in Europe:    it would be tragicif they were to separate and not to work any longertogether.    He could see that matters could not go on asat present, but in the interests of the Government andtf the Empire, he suggested that the Foreign Secretaryought to remain in the Government, and that somebody shouldbe put in charge of the Foreign Office who was in sympathy with the Prime Minister&apos;s policy.    On detailscompromise was possible, but in matters of principle,  ifthere was no agreement, the Government had the worst of both worlds.    It was no good negotiating with theDictator nations unless the Government were absolutelydetermined to get their own way and were united,  otherwisegrave difficulties would arise.
its o nThe Foreign Secretary said he himself had thought of that, but the Colonial Secretary need not take his resignation too tragically.    He was not going intoopposition.    He agreed, however, that the two minds ofthe Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary must thinkalike.    He hoped that the Prime Minister had not changedhis view in that.    He himself had not changed his mindat all.    Moreover a new policy would get a better fillipif he had left the Government.    After what had happened,he would find the situation impossible if he tried toremain in a Government that had adopted a new foreignpolicy.The President of the Board of Trade said thathe feared that the Government was going to get the worst of both worlds.    He believed that this resignationwould make impossible the concessions necessary tosecure agreement with Germany -The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said he believed on the previous day tha.t the difference wasone of timing and method, and that the Prime Minister,and Foreign Secretary merely wanted the Cabinet to decide between them.    It was a great shock ^hen he discoveredthere was a. fundamental difference.    Speaking as one ofthe members of the Cabinet outside the Foreign PolicyCommittee, he had not had the slightest idea of this.He and his colleagues had. admired, the Foreign secretary and even paraphrased, his speeches.   Now all had. torecognise that there was a different outlook.   A differ-once of principle and a difference of outlook hardlyseemed, distinguishable in foreign-affairs .   He did not agree that a decision coul^ be put off until a later stage, though he could hardly imagine a worse time than
the present.   He thought the Italian conversationsought to go on,   Much depended upon what would be theinterpretation of these events.    The Cabinet could count on the attitude of the Foreign Secretary himself, but acontroversy would rage outside.    It  could no longer be claimed that there was no difference of policy when ithad involved the resignation of the Foreign Secretary.It would be said in this raging controversy &quot;Are we to yield to the Dictators?&quot;    It would be said that we hadsacrificed the Foreign Secretary for a deal with signor mussolini,    Vas that sufficiently important for such asacrifice?    It was doubtful, however, whether we should get an agreement with Italy.    The Government might be faced with such a wave of public opinion as to jeopardise the object in view.    It was not for him tosuggest the right  course of conduct, but, looking tothe need for national unity, even at the eleventh hourhe thought it might be desirable to stave off resigna-tion in an atmosphere so peculiarly unfavourableo    Fromthe point of view of one outside the Foreign PolicyCommittee, the political effects of resignation appeared,calamitous .   He therefore appealed for some eleventhhour accommodation.The Lord Chancellor wanted to put on record atonce that, he had. not been aware of any difference onthe Foreign Policy Committee of a. fundamental  character.He recalled, however, a case where a. difference had arisen in the Cabinet in 1925 on a question of principle,namely, as to the despatch of troops to Shanghai,,Sir Austen Chamberlain had been opposed to their despatch.mhe Cabinet had taken a different view.   The troops hadbeen sent.   Sir Austen Chamberlain had said he wouldnot resign, owing to the gravity of the situation.   He
remained in office, and the Secretary of State for war had been asked to announce the despatch of the troops.Sir Austen was a man of scrupulous honour and finejudgment ,   He (the Lord Chancellor), like some of hiscolleagues, was under no illusion that a resignationmight jeopardise the Italian conversations and lead toa grave weakening of the National Government, who mightlose much support from people who thought that theGovernment had dropped, the principles of the foreign secretary   support of the League of Nations,, and so^orth.    It would he in the na.agriculture of a major disaster.The Secretary of Sta.te for Scotland supported thisview.   Foreign affairs nowadays had become a domesticissueo    &quot;he resignation would be interpreted as a move towards the Dictator States,    It would affect theprospects in every constituency.,    The Government would,obtain an agreement with Italy of a different  calibreto what might ha.ve been got if the Foreign Secretaryremained,  i The differences would not be solved, by thewithdrawal of the Foreign Sec^eta-ry, because they weredifferences of opinion and not of personality,^he clash would arise again.    If this resignation tookplace it would be repeating the troubles experienced,in France.    It would be the beginning of a departure from that, homogeneity for which our political reputation--*-ion was so high.The Lord. President of the Council said, that hehad been in a position in which he-had. realised, somedivergence of view between the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary, so he could understand, what wa.s inthe latter&apos;s mind.    But in these matters he had. some-times agreed with the Foreign Secretary more than withthe Prime Minister, an^ sometimes more with the PrimeMinister,    &quot;hat. showed that the Cabinet required both
views .    ^he broad fa ct was that- the Cabinet and thecountry needed both views.   that might be inconvenient-for both persons  concerned, but it was necessary.   hewart /ould like the conclusion to be that the Cabinet didnot accept the Foreign Secretary&apos;s resignation andthat he and. the Prime Minister should go into a roomtogether with a few colleagues and try to reach somemodus vivendi.   For the moment there should be nowriting of letters.The Secretary of State for Pir realise&apos;1 how much better it would be to maintain complete unity, ifpossible, but with the best will in the world he couldnot. see how that  could be achieved after what had happened.   The Cabinet understood the position, buthow were they to make people outside, understand it ?There might  come a. time when the differences could be shown to be real.   Then a change must take place.But everyone was agreed on the need for an italian agreement.    Supposing it iwere brought off successfully,what a pity if there ha.d been a split.   An agreement would be accepted quite differently here if the foreign secretary remained.    Otherwise the atmosphere would be prejudiced, before the agreement was ma.de.The President of the Board, of Trade, as one whohad to make a most difficult choice, made an appealto the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary.    TheCabinet should be under no illusion.    If this resigna-tion went through, it meant a breakdown of all policies the Foreign Secretary&apos;s policy would go;    the PrimeMinister&apos;s policy would be born in circumstances inwhich it could not possible succeed.   A resignationought not to be allowed.    It meant a break-up of theGovernment, a breakdown in Europe, and the triumph ofthe Dictators.   This terrible calamity must be averted.
The Prime Minister said that this discussion had.^een most painful to the Foreign Secretary and. himself:inevitably so because it had arisen out of a personaldifference,    On his own behalf he could, say thatthere was not a fundamental difference of policy.,A week ago, when the Foreign Secretary had. been speak-ing in Birmingham and there had been rumours about of disagreement, he felt that they were in complete agreement.    If he spoke of disagreement it was because he felt that there was. a difference of outlook, with-&quot;&quot;he result that each time when they were coming togrips on the question of conversations some objection was raised.   Ke felt that they wouIH never again obtain^he present opportunity.   The consequences of notseizing it were so fright fully serious for the country that he could not face it.-.   He could not contest theprognostications of the disaster that would result from the resignation of the Foreign Secretary on amatter concerning his Department.   He felt the utmost,concern,    So far a.s he was  concerned. v provided the conversations went, on, he wa.s ready to consid.er any arrangement.    If the Lord. President would suggest the names of a. few of his  colleagues he would welcome *heopportunity to discuss the matter with them.The Home Secretary said, he was glad to hear this.On the previous day it had seemed, that what theForeign Secreta.ry most drea.d.ed was ^eing .led. up thegarden pa.th by Italy, only to find that Mussolini andHitler had entered into some agreement, for no purpose.So far as the Spanish side went, that danger was agood deal reduced.   He wondered whether, withoutholding up the conversations, it might not be possibleto get some further agreement with Italy in regard to austria:    in other words, could, we not follow up hints
that Count Grandi had given in that direction?     A littleadvance there might be a great help to the foreign secretary.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs didnot think that the differences between the Prime Ministerand himself were fundamental, but there were differences of outlook and method.     He was conscious of differences in actual working0     To be honest, he was quite sure that if he acceded to the requests that had been put to him it would be of no value.     With that convictionin his mind he felt it was no use to aocede to thedesires of his colleagues to try and get the best ofboth worlds.      It was merely prolonging the agony.      he felt with the Dominions Secretary and Colonial secretary that the differences were too great0The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs felt it was no use trying to minimise the difficulties, whichwere considerable.     He agreed in every word that hadbeen said as to the bad effects of resignation, not only because Mr. Eden was Foreign Secretary but also because he was Anthony Eden.     His resignation would have a very bad effect at home and in Europe.     The differences were considerable, but he felt that the Foreign Secretary,like the Prime Minister, ought to consider the appealof his colleagues.     The differences had been in suchmatters as the Roosevelt letter and the Italian conversations and it had been said that further differences would ariseover Central Europe.     Could not the Foreign secretary and the Prime Minister sit down and consider whether these anticipations as to Central Europe werejustified?     He thought the matter should be exploredo
The Secretary of State for Scotland said thatthe Cabinet could, not take &quot;No&quot; as an answer.   they ought to adjourn and see if the last sugges+ion couldnot he followed, up.    If they only adopted the oldEnglish habit of an adjournment for tea they mighteffect something.   Resignation would not. only be theend of the Government hut also of the regime.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat it was impossible to part without one moreeffort.The Foreign Secretary said, he felt rather likethe Austrian Chancellor at Berchtesgaden, but he couldnot refuse.The Prime Minister suggested, that they should adjourn for tea, and a. few Ministers to be selectedLord.by the/President of the Council would remain in theCabinet Room with the Foreign Secretary and himself0^his was agreed to5 and theCabinet adjourned, at 4,45 p0mo
The Cabinet reassembled at 6.10 p0m0The Lord President of the Council, who at the requestof the Prime Minister had taken the chair at the smallmeeting of Ministers, said that the Prime Minister hadallowed him to put a suggestione     The Foreign secretary had thought that if the small group of Ministers firstdiscussed his difficulties alone in connection with the conversations over the Spansih aspect of the difficulties,progress might be madeB     He himself (the Lord President)had ventured to make the following proposal, namely thatwhen the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary saw CountGrandi on the following day, they should make a statement(bn the following effect:&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are entusiasticallyin favour of conversationso     They attackso much importance to them that they wouldhave preferred a longer time for preparation.If this, however^ was liable to be misunder-stood, in Italy,  they were willing to announcean early start.   They felt, however, that theymust make plain that an agreement on Spainmust form an integral part of the final arrange-ment and that no agreement could be reachedwithout it.     Moreover the question of abyssinia involved the League of Hations, andit was hopeless to try and obtain the agree-ment of the League without being able to^   \       announce publicly that the Italians were in.^ (ybjMCe-X fac-fc co-operating over Spaino&quot;They felt that that, in conduction with the statement thePrime Minister had already&apos;- made on Friday would in factprotect the position of the Foreign Secretary by introducing the Spanish point.      It would be made clear that recognitionof the Italian de jure position in Abj^ssinia was essentialto Italy, so a settlement on Spain was essential to us.That was not an unreasonable attitude to take in enteringon an agreement.     It would protect the Government against any suggestion that they were &apos;kow towing&apos; to the Dictators.
Stated in this way the problem was reduced to the proposition of whether the Foreign Secretary insisted ona satisfactory execution of the withdrawal &quot;by Italy oftroops from Spain before entering on conversations, orwhether he would be satisfied with performance must becarried out before an agreement could be completed.At the conclusion of the meeting the Foreign Secretarywho had listened with extreme patience had asked thearirne Minister for a little time to consider theproposal.The Prime Minister said that the proposal of theForeign Secretary had been that some time should be givento him, but that as it was undesirable to summon aCabinet again, he should write a letter..     His colleagues had felt, however, that this was not very satisfactory,and that by this course they would be deprived of anopportunity for making further observations if they felt they would be useful.     Then the suggestion had beenmade that the Foreign Secretary should return to the samegroup of colleagues, and that the Cabinet should leavefurther progress to them.     He hoped that the cabinet would agree.The Foreign Secretary said he had understood thatthe proposal depended on Count Grandi&apos;s confirmingofficially the information already received that theItalian Government would accept the British formula.The Prime Minister agreed in this,The Foreign Secretary thanked his colleagues^
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To adjourn in order to give the foreign secretary an opportunity to considerthe formula proposed by the Lord^resident of the Council, and reproducedaboveo(b) That the following Ministers, namely the Prime MinisterLord President of the CouncilSecretary of State for Dominion AffairsMinister for Co-ordination of DefencePresident of the Board of trade minister of Agriculture and Fisheries^should reassemble at Downing Street at7o30 poiUo to hear the decision of theSecretary of Stats for Foreign affairs and. on behalf of the Cabineo, to makeany further observations to him thatthey might think desirable0(c) That the Secretary should be instructedto attend the meeting at 7.30 pera,and to inform the Cabinet by writtenno ti c e of the re suit a3 iTote0    The lacier decision was not carriedout, because as a result of the*30 meeting the Prime hinisterdecided to ree-ssemble the cabinet at 10 n0muWhitehall Gardens, S.W.1.20th February, 1938.

In thisrespect, it was inferior to his own proposalo     If his ownplan was wrong, the only alternative was that prop&apos;&quot;3d by thePrime Minister, namely, to agre* to conversations and hope
that all would go well.     He felt sure, however, that thatplan would not work and if he said anything else,  theCabinet would afterwards reproach him.     That being so, hehad no alternative but to maintain his decision and to write to the Prime Minister a letter of resignation.The President of the Board of Trade said that,as was known to his colleagues, he took a different viewfrom the Foreign Secretary on this point.     On the otherhand, he felt that his resignation would be so disastrousthat the responsibility on everyone concerned was verygreato     Anything was better than to allow his resignation,He himself would prefer to adopt a course notwithstanding that he felt it to be wrong and that the Secretary of Stateplan should be adopted.The Prime Minister asked if it was the intentionof the Foreign Secretary to send him a letter of resignation.The Foreign Secretary replied in the affirmativeand withdrew.After the withdrawal of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, the Ministers discussed the resignation of the Foreign Secretary in its political aspects.     Eventually it was agreed that the Cabinet shouldhe summoned to meet at 10,0 p0m.After the above decision had been taken,Sir H,J. Wilson entered with a message from Sir alexander cadogan to say that Sir  NsvJJLe Henderson had been instructed by the Foreign Secretary not to accept an appointment with Herr Hitler without fresh instructions^from him.     He expected to hear the time of the appointment
that very evening.     The Foreign Office wished to know what instructions he should be given.After some discussion, the Ministers agreed:That the Prime Minister should authoriseSir Nevile   Henderson to say that, owingto the resignation of the foreign secretary, he was without instructions and must ask for a short delay. ...Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.SOth February, 1938.
