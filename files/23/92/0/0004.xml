o oR^UCTIDN ANDLDArWTQW QFARMAMENTS .(previous reference:Cabinet 3(38), Con-elusion 5.)1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that  certain comments he had. made, after consulta-tion with the Secretary of State for Air, in the debate in Parliament on Wednesday, 2nd February, hadattracted, more publicity than he ha^ anticipated.From both this and other points of view he thought itdesirable to go as fast a.s possible in working out proposals .The Secretary of State for Air reported that good progress had been made in the preparation of a Memo-randum. which would, cover not only the question of possible limitation in the character of air warfarebut also of qualitative and quantitative disarmament.No reservation would be made in respect of bombing for police purposes.   He gave further details, but wrernedhis colleagues that the question would affect both sea and land as well as air warfare.Tn the course of a short discussion the importanceo^ the formulation of policy on this ques+ion was stressed from th^ point of vie1&quot; of forthcoming conversa-tions with the German Government .    mhe clearer theGovernment&apos;s views on the subject could be made, the better.The Prime Minister asked the Secretary of State forAir to let him. know as soon as his proposals were ready, as it wa.s his intention to summon a. meeting ofthe Foreign Policy Committee to examine them.
GERMANY. 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed recalled that the appreciation of His Majesty&apos;sConverse-tions. Ambassador in Berlin on recent events in Germany wasvery similar to that or the Foreign Office.    Both(previous reference: documents had been circulated. An encouraging pointCabinet 3(38), Con-^ was that  General Beck, a moderate and an opponent of elusion 2.)FR..(0[ht)l.the Nazi Party, was still Chief of Staff.    He had notyet been approached as to who would be the next german ambassador.   He called attention to a declaration madeby the German Ambas^a^or in Pa.ris that there would beno change in Germany&apos;s foreign policy, and a. similardeclaration made to our Ambassador in Berlin byBaron von Neurath.   He thought it would be rash,however, tQ assume th*t this would be the case.The question arose as to the effect of these changeson our conversations with Germany.   Baron vonNeurath had suggested that there should be a. postponedment o&quot;p the conversations until after Herr Hitler&apos;sspeech on February 20th, and Sir Nevile Hendersonagreed.   His own first reaction, however, was that itwould ^e inadvisable to wait, as, if no further approach were ma.de, Herr Hitler might  expressdisappointment  that nothing had been done to follow up the Lord President&apos;s visit.   He had, however, not had time to consult his advisers .The Prime Minister pointed out  that the ambassador&apos;s present idea was to approach Herr Hitlerdirect.   He asked if that would not offend the newForeign Minister?    The point seemed to require futher consideration.mhe Secretary of State - for Var said that, theGeneral Staff had drawn his attention to the similaritybetween the  course adopted by Herr Hitler and. M. Stalinrespectively in sweeping away the Higher Command.
/Goering was unpopular in the Army, hut Generalvon Braus chitsch, the new Commander-in-Chief, was rather a ruthless man who technically was likely to favour increased mechanisation of the Army.    TheGeneral Staff thought  that the moral  of the Arm;.&apos; wouldbe somewhat shaken, and that it was probable that therewould he a. quiet period for a few months, after which no-one could foresee what would happen.mhe Secretary of State for Po?ninion Affairs saidthat he had seen the South African Minister in Perlin,who had expressed the hope that before Herr Hitler mad-this speech on February 20th we should let the GermanGovernment, know that we were prepared to make somesuggestions  to follow up the Lord President&apos;s visit.The Lord President  suggested that His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin should be asked to  consultHerr RiV-vent^-op, the new Foreign Minister, as towhether.it would be advisable for him to ask for an interview with Herr &quot;&quot;itler before February 30th,  inorder to inform him   of   our    proposals    to follow up his (the Lord President&apos;s)  own visit.    If Herr Ribben-trop replied in the negative, then the Ambassador might ask him to tell Herr Hitler that vs-is Majesty&apos;3 Govern-ment were ready to take the next step as soon as theChancellor was ready to receive him.This proposal met with considerable support.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Lord President&apos;s proposal made an appeal tohim at first sight, but he would, like to consider itfurther. He thought the minimum that the Ambassadorought to say was that he was available for a furtherconversation.It was suggested that the Ambassador should alsoinform Baron von Neurath, who, it was stated, had lately been rendering personal assistance to herr hitler in the preparation of his speeches.
The Prime Minister asked the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to consider the instructions toHie Majesty*s Ambassador in Eerlin in the light of thediscussion summarised above.-4-
SPAIN.The Nyonpatrol.*instruc-tions to?*.M.Ships ,(previous reference?Cabinet S(36), Con-clusion 4.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he hoped that the question of attacks by sub-marines and aircraft had. been disposed of for themoment, but the main danger arose from the irresporsi-bility of individuals.    If the steps that had beentaken *id not prove effective it would be necessaryto consider methods of retaliation, e.g., the seizure of a Nationalist ship for each ship that was sunk.The Prime Minister raised the question of theinstructions issued by the Admiralty.   He asked whatwould happen if our- warships in the patrolled areaencountered a Nationalist submarine coming to the surface?The First Lord of the Admiralty said that if this occurred after an attack had  just taken place thesubmarine would be captured.    If the submarine were merely encountered on the -surface it would be warnednot to submerge.The Chancellor of &quot;&quot;he Exchequer, who had. presidedat the Foreign Policy Committee when these matters had been discussed, said that there had been two mainsubjects of discussion:-(l) &quot;he public announcement;(2)  The instructions to H.M. Ships,^n the former point all had been agreed, and the word,&quot;attack&quot; had been used in preference to &quot;destroy&quot;.The instructions to H.K. Ship-s had not ^een discussed in detail.   He thought, however, that a. mistake hadbeen made on page 16 of the record of the Meeting(F,P.(35) 33rd Meeting), and that instead of the wordsattributed to Lord Chat field &quot;on the recognised. Nyonroutes&quot; (line 2) the decision of the Committee was intended to apply to submarines &quot;found submerged inthe patrol area&quot;.
The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed and. said,that the instructions had been drafted, to that effect.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that,having decided that a. submerged submarine was an intolerable nuisance that must be dealt withdrastically, it was hardly enough merely to take itsname or number when it  came to the surface, and. that.M. Ships would be entitled, to take the crew off and sink the submarine cThe President of the Board of Trade thought theintention of the Foreign Policy Committee had. beenthat the submarine should be captured and taken to port.After some further discussion the Cabinet e.greed -That the First Lord of the admiralty should &quot;he asked. -(a) to  circulate to the Cabinet Committeeon Foreign Policy the instructionsalready issued by the Admiralty tothe British section of the NyonPatrol,    and.(b) to examine the quest-ion further and.report to the Foreign Policy Com-mittee as to what action should, betaken in the event of a. subma.rinebeing seen to come to the surfacewithin the patrolled area, and. inparticular whether it ought  to besunk and. the  crew taken off, orwhether it should he captured, and brought to a British port.-6-
SPAIN.Won-Inter-vent ion.(previous reference cabinet 46(37), Con-conclusion 3 ,)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the situation would be greatly improved if the Non-intervention Committee could secure agreement on plans for the withdrawal of&quot;volunteers&quot; and the grant of some measure of belli-gerent rights to General Franco.   He gave the Cabinetaome account of projects that were now under consider-atIon.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed the hopethat it would not be assumed th8.t the proposals worked,out by the Secretary to the Non-intervention Committeecarried any Government authority.-7-
5. Arising out of the discussion on Spain referredto in the preceding Conclusion, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs said he proposed to continue had discussions with the Italian Ambassador not only onthe subject of Spain but also on the question of propaganda.    If that had the effect of damping down the broadcasting.dca.sts  from Ba.ri this would enable the conversations to be advanced, step by step in other subjects.   His proposal, therefore, wa.s to allow the conversations to develop between Count Grand! and himself in preference to inaugurating formal conver-sations between His Ma.jesty&apos;s Ambassador and count ciano in Rome, with all the publicity irprolved.The Prime Minister agreed, with the above proposals,but suggested that at a certain point       Count Cianomight   be asked to come to London to finish off the conversations.   He gave several reasons in favour ofthis  course.    Tn reply to questions as to the meaning of certain Press  comments he said thai it was not thein+ention of the Foreign Secretary to lay down condi-tions precedent to the conversations.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs.irs saidthat if the conversations were to enter a new phasehe felt thai, the question of Spain must be broughtinto them&apos;    otherwise some episode might occur, ashad. happened in the pa.st, such as the despatch of fresh Italian reinforcements to Spain, which wouldupset further progress.The Prime Minister felt sure that Count Grand!would, not be allowed to discuss the question of Spainunless he felt that the possibility of recognition ofthe Italian position in Abyssinia lay in the background.He gathered, however, that  Count Grandi was not troubledwith this aspect.   He hoped, however, that the italian ambassador&apos;s reference to the possibilities of media-tion in Spain would be followed up.-8-
6.    In reply fo the Prime Minister, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs said that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had been asked to arbitrate on matters relating to the exchange of prisoners, a.nd had agreed.He was at present awaiting     information from theNationalist Government.
THE PAR &quot;B/ST, 7,   The Prime Minister drew the attention of thejap**n and Cabinet to the Foreign Secret ary&apos;s despatch of 4thGhina.* February to His Majesty&apos;? Ambassador in Tokyo, in(Previous which he reported the result of an important conversa-Reference:Cabinet 3 tion with the Japanese Ambassador,    ^he latter, he(38), Con-clusion 2.)       pointed, out, had. begged the Foreign secretary&apos;s&quot; ^3S)&amp;. &quot;to consider whether we oould notinformally approach both sides&quot;with a. view to an end. to the conflict.    He asked if it was the intention of the Foreign Secretary tofollow up this suggestion?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs repliedin the affirmative.    The task, however, was one ofgreat difficulty and. delicacy, as the Germans had found, and. he felt that it  could, only be carried out.hand in hand with the United. States of America...    Onthat basis he was- prepared to/asftfee the attempt. j
8*   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence &apos;C.P.-18 (38))giving an account of the discussions that had takenplace in pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned in the margin with representatives of the Belgian Governmenton the question of Belgian &apos;7ar Requirements, and.details of a general survey by the Chairman o^ theSupply Board of the position as ascertained up toDecember la.st, in which the Belgian demand was dealtwith und er various headings.    At the end of his Memo-r and urn the Minister submitted conclusions for theapproval of his  colleagues.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence atthe end of a statement explaining his proposalssummarised them as follows:-(1)    That he should have authority to talk tothe Belgians and to tell them exactly what items of their requirements we could and could not supply in time of war:(2)   That where we could not supply them andthere was a risk of our competing in thesame market, the Belgian Government shouldbe encouraged to come to an agreement with us regarding such purchases:(3)   That we could not incur expenditure for thepurpose of providing a means of supplyingBelgium over and above what was necessaryto meet our own requiz^ements.The Secretary of State for War suggested thatthe alteration in the r6le of the Army might releasecapacity of production for the supply of countrieslike Belgium, and that hypothetical arrangements mightbe made for them such as were made for the TerritorialArmy,     If it is impossible to estimate these at present,the Belgian representatives might be notified that we might have something to add later.
Some doubts were expressed as to the precisemeaning of conclusion (ii) at the end ef the memorandum as follows&quot;That to this end the Belgians should now befrankly informed of the extent to which itis considered possible for us to meet their demands.&quot;The Prime Minister thought it v/as possible thatthe effect of the conclusion would be that on items of warequipment on which it was pos sible to meet their demand,the Belgians would not make arrangements to purchaseelsewhere;    in other words,  that they would make their wararrangements on the assumption that they would be able toget what they required here.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence said the discussions up to this point had been on a purelyhypothetical basis.      There had been no question of our undertaking the supply of any particular articles.     Theobject of the conversations had been merely to exploretheir needs and to find out to what extent it would bepossible for supplies to be made from this country.      Infuture conversations, he would, however, make clear that nocommitments were being undertaken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that itmight be placed on record that what was now being proposeddid not involve us in the provision of shadow factoriesor other expenditure for the purpose of supplying Belgium,and,, in addition,  that we did not give any undertaking inrespect of those items which we might be able to supply in war.      He was anxious that the misunderstandings that had arisen before the war, as to the extent of the commitmentsinvolved in military conversations, should not be repeated.
The Secretary of State for Forjign affairs pointed out that the circumstances wer? somewhat differentbecause we already had a political commitment in respectof Belgium.     He thought that what tho Belgians wanted toknow was what we hoped to be able to supply and, what was equally important, what we knew we could not supply.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed, but pointed to the difficulty of forecasting in advancswhat would be the circumstances of a particular war.The Prime Minister agreed, but thought it probable -that at a later stage, the Belgian government might ask for something more definite.The Cabinet agreed:(a)   To approve the following proposals by the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence on the understanding thatthe Minister would make sure that nosommitments by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were involved in respectof any supplies which it appearedprobable that we could undertakefor Belgium in time of wars-(i)    That it is desirable, both from the point of view of theBelgian Government and of ourown supply position, to put thequestion of the supply of theBelgian requirements on a more definite basis:(ii)   That to this end, the Belgiansshould now be frankly informed of the extent to which it isconsidered possible for us tomeet their demand:(iii)   That, in cases where it is foundto be impossible to do this, and where there is also risk oftheir competing in the samemarket as ourselves for supplies(e.g. Foodstuffs) to the detriment of us both,  the BelgianGovernment should be encouraged to come to some agreement with usregarding such purchases:
(iv)    That as regards our own Supply-Organisation, in view of the complexity and size of the Belgiandemands,  the responsibility fordealing with these requirements should be decentralised as far aspracticable and passed on by theSupply Board to the appropriated departments, the Supply Boardcontinuing to act as necessary forpurposes of co-ordination:(v)    That these departments should establish and maintain liaisondirect and as close as possible with the appropriate Belgianrepresentatives as regards the items for which each is responsible.That no expenditure in the provisionof shadow factories or other formsof war potential should be undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government onbehalf of Belgium over and above what was necessary for our own warneeds.
GIL PROM COAL.        9.  The Cabinet had. before them a Note by theProduction of-Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-19 (38))covering the Report of the Sub-Committee of the(previous reference:      Committee of Imperial Defence on the Production ofCabinet 70(33), Con- Oil from Coal (CI.D.
