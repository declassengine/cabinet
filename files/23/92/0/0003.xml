THE LORD MAYOR.       1.   The Prime Minister informed his  colleaguesProposed Annual that the Lord Mayor&apos;s Dinner to the Cabinet whichDinner. &apos;he had mentioned at the Meeting referred to in the(Previous margin, had now been fixed for Thursday   June 23rdReference: JCabinet 2(38), Con-clusion 1.)

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsga.ve the Cabinet an account of the international situation as revealed by va.serious  conversa.tions thathe had held with statesmen of different countries atthe recent meeting of the Council of the League ofNations at Geneva.    The general impression had been one of bewilderment rather than anxiety.    He had had.conversations with eight Foreign Ministers.   He had found that there wa,s much less immediate anxiety aboutpossible action by Germany.   For example, the PolishForeisn Minister had seen Herr Hitler and had obtained the impression that the internal difficulties inGermany were considerable and that the Army was notyet ready for a foreign adventure,    ^his was ratherconfirmed ^y the  conversation he had had. with the HighCommissioner of Danzig, an account of which had been circulated.   His  conversations with French ministers in Paris and at Geneva had. also been placed on record,and  circulated.    He had found a considerable and. very real desire for better relations with Germany.   with italy the desire was less, partly owing to the Frenchview of Signor Mussolini&apos;s instability and partly because they thoueht it less important.   He felt,however,  th*t if we wished to proceed with these con-versations we should meet with little obstruction fromthe French j &apos;d ^U^d^L. reconstruction^The Foreign Secretary then described the attitudeof M. Litvinof^, who on the present occasion had arrived without any technical advisers, had. been veryquiet and had made no difficulties in the discussions on the Far East . His own impression was that, theSoviet felt that they were in the position of tertiumgaud ens in that region.    It was evident, however, thatTbe Far EastJapan and china.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(37), Con-^ elusion
they were doing what they could to give China somehelp.   He added that some difficulty had been encountered in drafting an appropriate resolutionrelating to the situation in the Par East.   He himself was not particularly satisfied with the draft that had been telegraphed from Geneva, which reaffirmed theduty of the Powers to help China.    The matter, however,was one of great difficulty, on which he might haveto approach his  colleagues before longoThe Secretary of State had not formed, a goodimpression of the new Foreign MinLster of Roumania.,w-ho had suggested that after the elections Roumaniamight denounce the Minorities Treaties.    TheseTreaties were pa.rt of the arrangement by which somewhatexa.ggera.ted boundaries had been granted to Roumania bythe Peace Conference, an^ in the circumstances he had felt  constrained to speak rather strongly to M. Micescumhe situation was rendered a^kwa-rd. owing to theforthcoming State visit to London of ^ing Carol.He proposed to send a telegram on the subject toBucharest,    ^he French also had sent  a surprisinglysti^-0 telegram hinting that they would, not be able tomaintain the alliance unless the Roumanian Governmentmodified their attitude.    Before long he himself wouldbe ^ringing to the Cabinet the question of King Carol&apos;svis it.The proceedings of the Council over the questionof Alexa.ndretta were not very satisfactory.    TheTurks, as usual, had proved, hard, bargainers, and had pressed the French very heavily.    Dr. Aras, theTurkish Foreign Minister, had. spoken of his loyalty to ourselves,    ^he eventual decision had been thata Committee composed of representatives of the UnitedKingdom, Sweden, Pelgium and the two parties to the
Italy.ProposedConverse.-ions with.previous reference:Cabinet 45(37),  Con-elusion 5 .)Spain -previous reference:Cabinet 48(3 7), Con-clusion 4 .)dispute, should be formed to make such modifications as may prove necessary in the electoral regulations for the Sanjak drawn up by the League ElectoralCommission.    In present circumstances he had. felt it important to avoid antagonising the Turkish repre-sentatives in any way, and this result was the best that  could be managed.The Secretary of State said that he had not been pressed, on the subject of the recognition of theconquest of Abyssinia and had. not  encountered anyparticular difficulty.   M. Spaak, the Belgian ForeignMinister, however, had mentioned it.    He gathered,that, the King of the Belgians was rather embarrassedowin? to his relations with the Italian Royal Family,and the Belgian Government were hoping to arrange forthe appointment of an Ambassador to Rome without committing themselves to de jure recognition, somewhaton the lines of Mr de Valera&apos;s action.   He himself had. told most of the Foreign Ministers something ofwhat was in the minds of our own Government, without committing himself to details.   He thought it fair tosay that if we could arrive at an arrangement/with italy, more especially if it included. Spain, we shouldencounter no difficulty at Geneva.Everyone at Geneva, had expressed concern about.Spain.   There was considerable apprehension as to the likely effect, of General Franco&apos;s recent failureson Signor Mussolini, who would be faced with a freshdecision and would have to choose between going deeperinto the mire or cutting his losses.   He himself had.carefully examined all the information available inthe Foreign Office on the subject of recent Italianactivities in Spain.   He had come to the conclusion
that Sienor Mussolini had sent  a certain number ofairmen to Majorca, as veil as more than 4,000 men to spain.    This figure appeared to include a number ofofficers, per?na.ps to restore the moral of the Italiansoldiers, with whom service in Spain was reported tobe unpopular.    In any event. Signor Mussolini was faced,with a grave decision.He thought it possible that the political crisis in Germany was in some way connected with signor mussolini&apos;s decision.    He did. not exclude the possi-&quot;Hility that Signor Wussolini had told Herr Hitler thathe meant to finish off the Spanish War and had a^kedfor his support.    Such a request would produce violentdifferences in Germany, where opinion was much divided,on the sub subject.
5 &apos;iTHE LEAGUEOP NATIONS .Reform of.(previous reference:Cabinet 4SI % 7), Con-clusion 6.)7i * In reply to the Prime Minister, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affair? said that the generalsentiment at Geneva had been that on the subject ofthe future of the League or Nations the less said the better at the recent session.   He thought hiscolleagues rather took the same view.   Some of the jsmaller countries, Sweden in particular, found them-&apos;selves in a difficulty owing to the existence of anuncertain engagement.    Even the Swedes, however, twrkthe viev that  sanctions should be &quot;facultative&quot;.All the Powers at Geneva, including even Poland, whonotoriously was not a partisan of the League ofNations, were opposed to an alteration in the Covenant8t present.    ^he matter had been postpone^ until september.The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet hadrather inclined to favour a facultative solution ofthe sanctions question (See Conclusion referred to in* he margin.)The Foreign Secretary said that it woul^ have been impossible to get agreement on that  course at the re certmeeting, of the Council owing to the opposition of several Powers, including France.  Soviet Russia andthe Little Entente,   &quot;&quot;hese Powers probably hopedthat sanctions might operate more favourably if a.case affect ine them, were to arise.&quot;&quot;he Prime Minister pointed, out that the result was that if another difficult situation should arisebefore September   the position of the League wouldbe as unsatisfactory as ever.   The present weaknessbecame greater after each&quot;failure&apos;.
by a submarine. Referring to the recent sinking/of the british.S. ENDYMION, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that, this deplorable episode might be either an act of folly by an in^ivi^ual Commander orthe beginning of a new  campaign to intensify theblockade.   He hoped that the Cabinet would agree tosome firm action, as otherwise he was apprehensive ofthe effect it would have not only in the countries ofthe Mediterranean but all over the world, includingthe Far East .    After consultation with the PrimeMinister he had already arranged for the Ambassadorsof Prance and  Italy, the two Powers associated with us in the Anti-submarine Patrol, to meet him the same afternoon and. discuss the question.    The reaction tohis invitation of both Ambassadors had been good, andCount Grandi had sai^1 that he felt entitled, to acceptwithout  consulting his Government.    The line that,subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, the Secretary of st^te proposed to take was to sa.y that the sinking ofthis ship by a. torpedo was not only serious but whollytin jus * if able, since, even if belligerent rights hadbeen accorded, the sinking of a merchant ship at sightwas a breach of the laws and. customs of war.    In future,therefore, we would feel ourselves free to sink anysubmergedsubmarine that we found^in the area of the British.Pa.trol.    That had been the original idea discussed, atthe Nyon Conference, but the plan had afterwards been altered so as only to enahie sinking to take place after a torpedo had been fired by a submarine.Something drastic of this kind was, in his opinion,necessary at the present time.    In reply to the PrimeMinister he said that he did not propose to invite theFrench and Italian Governments to a^opt the samedecision,   ^he position op the Italians was rather
different, as their sector of patrol was well away-from Spanish waters. He thought it quitp possibleth&quot;t the French, whose section o^ the patrol, likeour own, adjoined Spanish waters, would follow oarexample.The First Lord o^ the Admiralty pointed out thatif this proposal were adopted we should in the firstinstance restrict the new orders to our own area offthe Spanish coast and not extend it to the other area,where we were responsible for the patrol in the Aegean Sea.It was suggested th^t the decision of the  ItalianGovernment as to whether to follow our example or notwould ^e eased by the fact that the  circumstances inwhich their pa.t&quot;^ol operated resembled our AegeanWesternrather than otnyMei*iter^anean patrol.    .fhat reallyjustified, the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal was thatthe sinking or theS^.2. ENBYMTON took place off theSpanish coast .The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out thatthe proposal was a very serious one,  since in effectit meant  denying to General Franco the use of hissubmarines.    The object of the Nyon Agreement ha&quot;1 been to stop submarine piracy, which had disappeared untilthe present incident.    Ever since the Nyon Conferencewe ha^ managed tG maintain good relations with theSpanish authorities .    //hen the british  Senior naval officer ha.^ seen the Spanish Commander-in-Chief atPalma on the previous  day the latter ha.d shown himselfperturbed at what had happened;    had frankly admitted that a Nationalist submarine was operating in that area (which was known to the Admiralty from, other sources)&quot;,    had stated that the submarine in question was aue at Palma the same afternoon;    and had. underr-taYen to go into the ma+ter in detail and to give a-8-
further -report .    In the circumstances the First Lordraiser1 the question as to whether it might not betetter to wait until further information was avail-able-    He suggested that a. Note might he sent toGeneral Franco&apos;s Government demanding an apology,an explanat ion, and punishment of the offender.The Cabinet were re^lnde^, however,  that general franco&apos;s submarines were wholly unjust ified in sinkingat sieht.   People who did that kind of thing under-stoo^ nothing but force.    Our prestige latterly had suffered severely all over the world because it wa.sthought that we would never assert ourselves.    Onthe present occasion we had received gross provoca-tion and had every justification to use force.It was pointed out that the offending submarinemight not have been a. Spanish one.The question was raised, as to what should besa.id in Parliament .The First Lord sai&apos;1 that he contemplated sayingthat all the information in the possession of the/dmiralty led  the-&quot; to believe that on this occasionit was n Nationalist submarine manned by Spanishofficers an^   crew, but of course they ha.^ no  conclu-sive proof that that part particular submarine had fired,the torpedo,mhe Prime Minister thought that this was rathertoo committal. and suggested  that  if the question was raised the First Lord should, stall it off and.say that he hoped to obtain the fullest possible information from survivors and other sources.The Foreign Secretary said that, the ForeignOffice were  collecting all possible information onthe subject and hoped to obtain information fromsurvivors.    If the information which they and theAdmiralty we^e a^le to obtain from, different sources-o..
justified *he assumption that it was a Wa.tiona.listsubmarine, he proposed to approach Genera.! Franco&apos;sGovernment and to ask for compensation for the crew.In reply to the Lord Chancellor he said, it wasthe intention of the Foreign Office to notify the newdecision to both parties to the Spanish struggle.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the action taken by theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs in invitinp- the French and ItalianAmbassadors to discuss the questions arising out of the sinking of theS.S. ENDYMION the same afternoon:(b) Th^t the Foreign Secretary should beauthorised to inform the two Ambassadors-dors of the intention of His Majesty&apos;?Government to instruct H.M. Shipsengaged on the Anti-submarine Patrolthat they were free to attack anysubmerged submarine found in that area.This would apply at once to the Britishare* of the Western Mediterranean Patrol,but not to the British Patrol area inthe Eastern Mediterranean:    he shouldalso notify the decision to the contend-ing Governments in Spain:( c) That the Secretary o^ State should not.press the French and  Italian governments to adopt the same measures, but should leave it to their discretion, recognising that the circumstances of the Italianpetrol resembled our Eastern rather than our western Mediterranean patrol:(d) &quot;^hat the Admiralty should issue thenecessary instructions for enforcing the above decision:(e) ^hai if the question of the nationality of the offending submarine was raised in the House of Commons, the First Lordof the Ad.mira.lty should state that everyeffort was beinp- made to obtain informta-tion on the subject from every possiblesource, including the survivors, andthat pending these enquiries he was notprepared to make a statement .

6-The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePrime Minister ^C.P.-10 (38))  covering a Note of a conversation he had had with M. Van Zeeland. on 7thsJanuary, 1938, and a Translation of the latter&apos;sReport on the Inquiry which he was asked by the Frenchand British Governments to undertake into the possibilities-ity of obtaining a general reduction of quotas and ofother obstacles to international trade,    In Part iii of his Report M, Van Zeeland had proposed, that a meet-ing should be arranged between representatives of thefive Principal Powers, viz., United States of America.,Hnited. kingdom, France. Germany and. Italy, with a viewto seeing if agreement  could be reached on certain general principles which could be embodied in a pact of Economic Collaboration.   He had also suggested, thatin order to put this programme into effect we should consult with the French an&quot;1 United States governments and arrange that a joint invitation should be sent bythe United States, France and. ourselves (as the three parties to the tripartite Declaration)  to Germany andItaly.   The Prime Minister, however, had. suggested, asan alternative, that, the French and British governments should keep the initiative in their hands, and that,subject to consultation with the United States Govern-ment, they might invite M, Van Zeeland, in the firstinstance,   to visit Berlin, Rome and. Washington, and as certain the reactions of these countries to theproposals in his Report, and if he found, them willingto send representatives to a meeting, to work outtentative drafts for consideration at such a meeting,M&apos;. Van Zeeland had expressed willingness to undertake this further task if requested,    ^he Prime Ministertherefore proposed, subject to the agreement of hiscolleagues,  that the Foreign Office should get in touchwith the French and United States Governments andenquire if they agreed with this procedure.-12-
The Prime Minister explained the reasons for his proposals.   He said that the reaction to the Reportin the United States of America had not. been very good, but in Germany it had. been rather better.In reply to a question he said that he had ascertained from M, Van Zeeland that the references to colonies on page 1^ were not meant to prevent thegrant of Imperia.1 Preference to Colonial Possessions.He said. tha.t we should have to follow up the Reportafter the pre! iminnvy steps he had. proposed to theCabinet.    One of the main difficulties was thatnations were not at present in a receptive spirit.Tf we could obtain a more conciliatory atmospherethe prospects of some arrangement, would be moresat if? fa factory .The President of the Board of Trade said, thatthere might be a. demand that while the Report, was underconsideration no new Import Duties Orders should, bemade.    Tf, however, any such Orders were recommended,by the Import Duties Advisory Committee he proposedto deal with them in the ordinary way.The Prime Minister agreed .   Any action we mighthave   to taKe in that direction would be to meet our own requirements, an^ we  could not be bound,unilaterally not to       this.    He proposed, as a preliminary step prior to examination by Ministers,to set up an Inter-Departmental Committee to examinethe Report, but add_ed that before tolling that step heproponed to aw-a-it the Report of another Inter-Departmental Committee that had been appointed toconsider a kindred, question.
The Cs^inet agreed  (a) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs t* get in touchwith the French and United states government and to enquire if they agreed with the following procedure:(h) That. su1&quot;) ject to consult at ion v.*with the United States Government, theFrench an^ british  Governments should keep the ini+iative in their own handsan^ invite M.

THE RENT T*      Th-e Cabinet had before them the Report (C.P.-14D-RS&apos;T,RTCT&apos;rONSACTS AND (38)) of the Committee appointed at the MeetingRATING RE-VALUATION, mentioned in the margin to consider the Reports of report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Rent Res trie-Committee .tions Acts and. the matter of the general revaluation(previous for rating purposes which will come into effect on the reference:Cabinet 47        1st April, 1939.    The following Appendices were(57), Con-elusion 13.)     attached to the Report:-F?f? S(h4)&apos;7. I. Reports of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee (Cmd. 5621 of 1937):to       it-XT . Draft White Paper on government policy on Rent Restriction, erabody-ing the conclusions reached by theCabinet Committee:III. Minor amendments recommended in theMajority Report of the Ridley Committee(Memorandum by the Minister of Health):IV, Rating and Valuation in England and Wales(Memorandum by the Minister of Health) .The Committee suggested that if the Cabinet approvedtheir conclusions and recommendations, the Ministerof Health should be authorised to arrange for the drafting of the necessary legislation and for itssubmission in due course to the Committee of HomeAffairs.The Secretary of State for India, as chairman of the Cabinet Committee, gave his colleaguesa summary of the voluminous papers that had been circulated on the subject.The Minister of Health thanked the Secretaryef State for India for the trouble he had taken inthis matter and, while not concealing the parliamentary and public difficulties that would be encountered inthe adoption of this, or, for that matter,  any other policy on the subject, strongly supported the Report.The Cabinet then turned to the   questionQ..f revaluation.
The Secretary of State for India explained thereason which had led the Cabinet Committee to recommend theinclusion in the Rent Restriction  Bill of a provision to give effect to course IV in paragraph 17 of Appendix IV,i.e. in effect to restore Section 12 (9) of the rent restriction Act of 1920, but so extended as to cover houses in general (conclusion(8)of CoPo 14 (38)).The Minister of Health then informed the Cabinet thathe had been in touch with the Central Valuation Committeein order to ascertain their views.     After hearing hisexplanation of what was proposed., the Central ValuationCommittee had made clear that they were themselvesconcerned about the situation;    that they were not surprisedthat the Government was contemplating some action;    butthat they themselves thought that a postponement of the revaluation for two years would be a much better course,as this would give them an opportunity to confer with thelocal authorities^      That course would be very convenientfrom the point of view of the Government, particularly ifthe suggestion came from the Central Valuation Committeethemselveso     He had reason to believe that if they weregiven the opportunity, they would make a recommendation tothat effect.     He suggested, therefore, that the question should be referred back to the Cabinet Committee who should be asked to meet on the following day to considerthe proposal he had nade.     He suggested also that thedecision should be left to the Committee.      If it was foundthat the two-year postponement was adviseable, he wouldapproach the Central Valuation Committee with a view totheir making a recommendation.      This would involve ashort Bill.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the conclusions andrecommendations of the CabinetCommittee as set forth in conclusions 1 to 6 of paragraph 17of the Report of the Cabinet Committee(CP. 14 (38)):(b) To approve the draft statement ofGovernment policy on rent restrictionembodying the conclusions of theCabinet Committee (CP. 14 (38)Appendix II) and to authorise its publication as a White Paper:Revaluation for rating purposes.(c) That the question should be referred back to the Cabinet Committee forre-examination in the light of the new situation outlined by the Minister ofHealth and summarised above with powerto take a decision on behalf of theCabinet, subject to the Prime ministers approval:(d) To take note that if the course proposed by the Minister of Health was approved, it would involve a short bill:Legislation,(e) That the Minister of Health should beauthorised to arrange for the draftingcf the legislation involved in theabove decisions, and for its submission,in due course,  to the Committee of HomeAffairs.Note:      It was arranged that the Cabinet Committeeon Rent Restrictions Acts and RatingRevaluation would meet on the following day, Thursday, February 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.in the room of the Chancellor of theExchequer to consider the question ofrevaluation.
V 0RESERVES OP POODAND POOD STORAGEWhele Oil.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(37), Con-clusion 8.)So   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence I.CoP.,-15(37))  asking authority, in advance of a decision onthe general question of food, storage,  to arrange withUnilever Ltdc for an increase in the stock of whaleoil normally held in this  country, in order to supplement the stocks of fats which ordinarily do notexceed six weeks&apos;   supply,   Unilevers were preparedto maintain at Eromborough (near Liverpool)  from 1st March, 1938, until 28th February, 1939, a minimumreserve of 60.;000 tons of whale oil, which would,represent in time of war about  four weeks&apos;   supply ofedible fats, if the Government would agree to recoupthem in respect of the additional expenditure theywould, incur in handling and freightage, not exceedingin all  34,800.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defoncemade a statement to the Cabinet in amplification ofhis memorandum, in the course of which he quoted an answer from Messrs, Unilever to an enquiry as towhether there was any risk that the increase ofwhale oil would involve a decrease in the storageof other forms of fats dealt with by the Companyas follows&quot;It is clear from the answers above thatthe intention is to hold in this countryan additional reserve of whale oilbeyond the normal amount,      There would beno decline in normal stocks of whale oilat Port Sunlight since the essence of thescheme is to maintain total stocks at port Sunlight at a figure of 60,000 tons.With regard to possible effects, if any,on other stocks of whale oil and vegetableoils,, the answer would be that these stocks are governed by commercial caonsiderations and are normally no more than are needed for current requirements.     It is difficult tosee how any firm assurance could be given that other stocks will not decline sincenormal stocks constantly fluctuate owingto the state of the market, and it would
be exceedingly difficult to frame any undertaking or to be certain that any suchundertaking was being observed.      there appears to be no doubt, however, thatUnilevers themselves do not anticipate that other stocks of whale oil or substitutableoils would be reduced as a result of theschemec&quot;He himself felt satisfied at this answer. The position was that if l,x&quot; was taken as representing the normallasted, that the stock amounted to x * 60,000 tons.In existing circumstances, the stock was apt to rundown at certain seasons to x 4- 10,000 tonso      If thearrangement was approved by the Cabinet, he did not propose to mention it at present in Parliament, but itwould be a strong moral support for him in dealing withthe questions that were asked every week about foodstorage.     He thought it right, however, to warn hiscolleagues that if his proposal was adopted, it mightbe rather difficult to turn down the larger proposalsfor storage of food stuffs.     He made a strong appealto the Cabinet, however, to support the proposal0to say what was the principle to which the Governmentwould be committed by adopting this proposal.     Therewas   always  a large amount of food storage in thecountry.      The only question to decide with regard to each item of food was whether any further food storagewas necessaryothat if the proposal was adopted, legislation would benecessary to enable his Department to pay the freightsinvolved.     It would be difficult to pass such legislation for so small an item as whale oil, unlessthe Government were legislating for food storage on amuch larger scale, as he himself would like to see done.The Prime Minister thought it rather difficultThe President of the Board of Trade reported
The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defencedoubted the need for legislation.     He had regarded itas merely a question of making a contract.     He thoughtit ought to be possible to find some means of effecting payment without legislation.     He recalled that the larger question of food storage was to be dealtwith in his Second Report on the Defence Programmes0On the question of bona fides, he proposed to obtain from the Chairman of Unilever a statement of his intention to add 60,000 tons to the stocks of fats heldby the Company for human comsumption.The Prime Minister suggested that the cabinet should adopt the proposal on the assumption that nolegislation was necessary and leave it to the Ministerfor Co-Ordination of Defence to clear the question up.The Cabinet agreed:(a) On the assumption that no legislation was necessary, to approve the proposal of the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence as set forth in CP. 15 (38)and summarised above:(b) That the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence should explore thequestion as to whether his proposal could be carried out without legislation,,(c) That the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence should satisfy himself that there was no risk thatMessrs. Unilever would make use ofthe increased amounts of whale oil to reduce their stocks of other formsof fats for human food.

The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (CoPo-16 (38))  seeking authority for theintroduction of a Bill to extend the Housing (RuralWorkers) Acts, 1925-1935, which are due to expire onthe 24th June next, until 30th September, 1942, andto make certain minor amendments therein as proposed,in the memorandum in the course of a short discussion, thePresident of the Board of Trade mentioned that it had come to his notice that full use was not made of thepresent Acts owing to the limitation of the amount ofexpenditure to which the benefits of the Act would apply to a minimum of  500      It sometimes happenedthat an owner of house property was anxious to bring-up to date a number of houses at a considerableaggregate of cost, but was unable to obtain the benefitof the Act because, for each individual house, theexpenditure was less than  500The Minister of Health said that this figure had been fixed for good reasons, but he undertook to look into it once more0The Cabinet agreed;To approve the proposals of theMinister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland as set forth in GoPo 16 (38) and summarised above
10-The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatiCH ASSEMBLY:MUNIREAPPOINTMENT OP a question had been brought to his notice regarding theUSHOPS) .Praemunire (Appointment cf Bishops) Abolition measure which had been introduced at the Autumn Session of theChurch Assembly on the 15th November, 1937.    The Measuresought to repeal Section  5   of the Act 25 Henry VIIIcap.  20,  which provided that Leans and Chapters who refused to elect and Archbishops or Bishops who refusedto consecrate the person nominated by the King asBishop  shall   suffer the penalties of Praemunire, whichwere of a drastic character.    The Act of Henry VIII was,of course, obsolete.    It was on this ground that theCommittee, on whose report the present Measure was based,had made their recommendation for repeal, but there r\was little doubt that the Measure had been Regarded bythe Members as an effort to get rid of some part of theauthority exercised over the Church by the State.    Underthe procedure laid down by the Church of England Assembly(Powers) Act,  1919,  the Measure would have to be confirmed by an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament,after which it would be presented to His Majesty for theRoyal Assent.    There was no statutory provision forascertaining the views of the Government before theresolution came before Parliament-    If the government took the view that they might have to oppose theresolution, he thought the wise course would be to warn the Church Assembly,    The subject was a novel one for him, but he had examined it to the best of his ability,and had reached the view that it would be a mistake to abolish the penalties of Praemunire without putting
something in their place,  since the 6ovor-nmcn-fc would thenbe left with certain duties to perform,  but no sanctionsbehind them.    No one was able to devise any othersanctions.    There was, however, no reason to suppose thatthe present obsolete legislation did any harm,  or that difficulties were likely to arise under it.    The worstthat could happen would be a refusal by some EcclesiasticalAuthority to elect or consecrate the person nominated by the King as Bishop.        In that event,  sanctions,of course, could not be enforced;    a deadlock would arise,and a solution would have to be found.    If the present proposals were allowed to come up in Parliament,   it was probable that someone would oppose the resolutions,and in those circumstances the Government could hardlyrefrain from offering guidance.    If so far-reaching aquestion as the relations between Church and State wasto be raised,   it ought to be discussed and decided onits merits and not on a minor measure of this kind.Since, then,  the Government might have to oppose theMeasure, he thought that the Archbishop of Canterburyought to be warned.    He had not felt entitled to do this without Cabinet decision.The Lord Chancellor said that it would also benecessary, before the matter was raised in Parliament,to obtain the assent of the T*!ing to place his prerogativeat the disposal of Parliament.    This would involve thetacit approval of the Government when the King gave his assent.The Prime Minister said he had sounded the archbishop on the subject, and had ascertained that he attached no great importance to this proposal.    He had
warned His Grace that after consulting his colleagues he might have to communicate with him further.The Cabinet agreed:That the Prime Minister should be authorisedto warn the Archbishop of Canterbury thatif the matter were pressed to a Division inthe House of Commons, the Government wouldhave to give advice to the House, and tobade that advice by the presence of theWhips on the Division,  and that their advice could only be to oppose theMeasure, leaving the constitutional position undisturbed.
11.   The Cabinet had before their a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (C.P.-17 (38)) on thesubject of the Stabilisation of Rates of Charge inthe Road Haulage Industry, to which he attached acopy of a Report on Service and. Rates by the transport advisory Council.    After explaining the recommenda-tions  contained in the Report as to the steps neces-sary to secure stability in the industry, which included the regulation of wages and of rates of charge, the Minister set forth his reasons for seeking the approval of his colleagues to an early announce-ment that the Government accepted, the Report of theTransport Advisory Council in principle and. proposedin due course to introduce legislation accordingly.He would then be in a position to consult the Organisa-tions interested and to determine a number of points of detail which were not  covered by the Council&apos;sReport but which must, be settled before a Bill couldbe prepared.The Minister of Transport explained his proposals to the Cabinet.      In reply to the primeMinister, he said that legislation was not contemplated in the present Session.The Secretary of State for Air said he felthe ought to report a recent episode affecting his department lest it should bear on the present proposals.  The Home Affairs Committee had agreed to aresolution on the subject of the licensing of air transport.     A proposal had been made at the Committeethat a tribunal should lay down the maximum fares.He had accepted this, but rejected a proposal forminimum fares.
The Minister of Transport said that thatwould not affect his proposals.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of theMinister of Transport as set forth in CP. 17 (38) that he should he authorised to make an early announcement that the government accepted, in principle, the Reportof the Transport Advisory Counciland proposed, in due course, tointroduce legislation accordingly:(b) That the Minister should thenconsult the organisations interested and determine a number of points of detail which were not covered bythe Transport Advisory Council&apos;sReport, but which must be settledbefore his Bill could be prepared.

After exchanging communications withthe Viceroy, he had, on the previous day, advised the King that next winter would be inopportune forthe Visit0     The main reason for this was thefinancial situation in India.     He had received thebudget and it was clear that there would be nomoney to spare from the current revenue.      To borrowmoney for the purpose of a Royal Visit, however, wasinadviseable.     His Majesty appreciated the reasons and had asked him to draw up the terms of anannouncement for issue in the near future.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for india should draw up the terms of anannouncement to the effect that noRoyal Visit would   he made to india during the coming winter,for issueafter obtaining the King&apos;s approval.
