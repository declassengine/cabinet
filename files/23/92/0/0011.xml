9 9 qO i, &amp;mHE CABINS. - 1.    The Prime Minister reported that the President1 of the Board of Trade hoped to       sufficientlyrecovered from his indisposition to return on Monday next, though he expressed the hope that his colleaguewould not return until his health was fully restored.The First Lord of the Admiralty had written tosay that he was recovering.He took the opportunity to welcome the Lord privy seal on his return from a somewhat arduous visit toAustralia.
roumania.Visit of king Carol.(previous reference:Cabinet ^(38), Con-clusion 2.)2. The Prime Minister said that among thefestivities arrange^ for the visit of the King of roumania was a Luncheon at the Guildhall on March2^r6.   Following the precedent adopted in the caseof a recent, visit, by the ving o-e the Belgians, hewould ask the Cabinet to meet that, day at 10 a.m..in uniform.   While he did not expect every member ofat the Luncheonthe Cabinet to be presenj/, he hoped, that as many aspossible would accept the invitation.(The Lord Chancellor entered at.this, point.)&quot;
ITALY. 3. The Minister for Co-ordination of DefenceRelations       informed the Cabinet that he had received a report with.from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee containing(Previous some suggestions for amending certain passages relatingReference:Cabinet 10 to military ma.matters in the instructions approved by the(38), Con-elusion 4.) Cabinet for the guidance of the Earl of Perth inconnection with the forthcoming Anglo-Italian conver-sations &apos;C.P.-^6 (38)).   His first impression onreading their Report was that they might have taken a slightly different view if they had been present atthe discussions at the Committee on Foreign Policyand the Cabinet on this subject.    The intention ofthe Cabinet was set forth in the following sentence:-&quot;What should be aimed at is a. periodicalexchange of information (e.g., everysix months) relating to militarymovements of major importance.......n,and the meaning turned a. good deal on the last threewords ^underlined).    He did not think the intentionof the Cabinet had been that either we or the ItalianGovernment should report every detail of our respectivedefensive preparations in the Mediterranean.   Hesuggested that, the matter should be left for discussion between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and himself.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he did. not think that there was any disagreement between him and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.^he Cabinet agreed  That the Report of the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee on the Anglo-ItalianConversations (CP.-56 (38)) should bede^lt with direct between the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence.
4. The Cabinet had before them a Most Secret Noteby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP .-58 (38))  circulating a despatch from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin forwarding a trans-German Interpreter&apos;slation of the/notes of his conversation with herr hitler on the 3rd March.^e Secretary o^ State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the despatch conveyed the impression that herr hitler had. been at his worst and that Herr Ribbentrophad been thoroughly unhelpful.    The German government appeared to be set head-on to achieve their desiderata.in Central Europe and did not want to tie their handsby talks, and still less by undertakings to ourselves.That left us in a rather dangerous position.    On theprevious day he had received rather a sharp rejoinderfrom the French Government to his note explaining our views on their proposals for joint representations to herr Hitler on his Austrian policy.    mhe moral he drewallwas that/this emphasised the importance, of the convex sations with the Italian Government.    There was some reason to believe that Signor Mussolini was annoyedwith the Germans, and that the Germans felt resentmentat the support that they suspected, the Italians ofgiving to the Austrian Chancellor.All this tended to emphasise the importance ofhis forthcoming interview with Herr Ribbentrop, and he felt that the Cabinet ought to know the line he proposedto take, which was as follows.     the proposed that his remarks should be composedof a mixture o-f disappointment, reproach and warning.His warning would not. takf2 the form of threats, but rather of putting&apos; the objections to Herr Hitler&apos;sstatements.   He proposed to say that the reports
o 9 Cw Jreceiver1 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin weredisappointing.   He would recall the general nature ofthe Ambassador&apos;s approach, which had taken the formof a sounding on the colonial question and a repetition of the need of some contribution by Germany.    In doing so he would recall that Herr Hitler, last. November,had told him that the colonial question was the onlydirect issue outstanding between the T7nited. Kingdomand Germany.   He intended to say that the Ambassador&apos;approach had been in conciliatory terms.   He had begunby opening up the colonial question (on which theForeign Secretary remarked that he had gone beyondhis instructions).   He had shown that the Governmentwere willing to do what they could about the press and the B.B.C.   He had pointed out ths-t we had taken a reasonable line about Central Europe and had doneour best to steady opinion as to Austria and to use our influence in Czecho-Slovakia in favour of asettlement of the German difficulties:    and on thequestion o^ air bombardment he had taken up herr hitler&apos;s own proposal.   Herr Hitler&apos;s response,however, had been disappointing.   He had spoken ofthe unconditional return of all the ex-German colonies,which was more than he had said to himself (Lord.Halifax) .   He had made a violent, attack on the british press, suggesting that His Majesty&apos;s Government should,impose prohibitive restrictions, a.nd had hinted, thatofficial British circles were responsible.He proposed to speak very frankly.   He would, saythat His Ma. jesty*s Government sincerely desired, peace and good relations between all nations.    Good, relationsbetween the United ^ine^om and Germany would be an immense contribution towards this end.    For thisreason they had been prepared to run great risks and.
to make sacrifices.   He would not conceal his disappointment -pointment. therefore, as to the Fuhrer&apos;s response,though he would intimate that this made no difference to their desire to improve relations.   He would saythat the Government would at any time be ready to join the German Government in an attempt to realise an understanding, hut if success were to be achievedall must help.    &apos;Ve had from, the beginning made it plainth*t colonies could not be treated in isolation.   Wehad no desire to block any peaceful agreements arrivedat by peaceful means.    Ve had not. tried to block theGerman policy in Austria, but had tried to steadyopinion.    At Prague we had used all our influence topromote a peaceful settlement.   He would, however, beless than frank if he did. not make clear to the GermanGovernment the danger he saw in the expression thatresponsible leaders in Germany were giving in public to German policy and to the spirit in which theirpolicy was being pursue^.    This seemed to us to putback the chance of reaching peaceful settlements andto hold out very dangerous possibilities for Europe.The last thing he wanted to see was a war in Europe,but the experience of all history went to show thatthe pressure of facts was sometimes more powerful thanthe wills of men, and. if once war should start in central Europe it was impossible to say where itmight, not end. or who misht not become involved .    That,he would say, was the situation a.s we saw it, adding that a heavy responsibility lay upon all, and not leastupon the German Government.   He would observe that the language used of late by the Chancellor and by field marshal Goering, both in public and in private, couldnot fail both to make a peaceful solution more difficult
o. Oi nD *0 3and to excite apprehension lest it might one day leadto some act which in its turn,  contrary to theintention of the German Government, might precipitatea general conflict.    Tf such an explosion occurredno man could tell what might he the limit or the end.His general line, there-Tore, was not to give theGermans the impression that we were running after them:hut to show that we were not shutting *he door.   Hewould appeal also to Herr Rihhentrop&apos;s well-known desire for an understanding, and would intimate that conditions were nov.r comparatively favourable and might not return,t-f, therefore, they wanted progress, it was for them tot8ke advantage of so favourable an opportunity.Tn reply to a question as to what he meant by a&quot;favourable opportunity&quot; he said that the Prime Ministerha&apos;1 shown himself to be anxious -Tor an understanding,and that he himself had the reputation of being infavour of something of the kind.In the course of the discussion it was suggested,that it would be important  to avoid giving the impres-sion that it was a ease of &quot;now or never&quot;.The Prime Minister explained that that was not. atall the intention.    Tt was not proposed to say thatthis was the last, opportunity, but that it was a morefavourable opportunity than might occur again.     Hethought that, the Foreign Secretary1 s way of putting thematter was admirable.   He did not want to give an impression that all was right when Germany, after makingso much fuss about colonies, had replied by saying thatthe question could he put. hack for six to ten years,during .whieh interval they proposed to get. their own way in Central Europe.
Tn the course or the discussion it was suggestedthat His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin might ha.veadopted a firmer line in his replies to the german chancellor.    His telegrams preceding the conversationha.d taken the form of advice to go to considerableGermanlengths in conceding the/point of view on the question/        to have followed up this line,of Central Europe, and he seemed/On the question of colonies also he ha^ sone beyond his instructions.Attention was called also to the fact that herr hitler, after saying l8st November that the questionof colonies was the only matter between the twocountries, appeared no^ to be finding other obstacles to an understanding, such as the attitude of the Press  which was a matter that no British Government  could,ever control   besides reverting to the difficultyover Russia in connection with disarmament.A suggestion wa.s made that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should follow the example of &quot;isMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin in having some form ofagreed record of the forthcoming conversation preparedwhich could be sent  to Berlin for the information ofthe German Government, so as to ensure that his ownstatement reached Herr Hitler and other members of theGerman Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed in principle with this proposal, and undertook toconsider how effect could be given to it.   He also said that he intended to put. something in writing tomake clear that the sounding taken by His Majest.y&apos;sGovernment on the subject of colonies was limited tothe proposal relating to the Congo Basin Treaties(CP.-1^ (38), page 3) and. did not  cover the restora-tion of former German colonial territory outside that.area, as intimated by the Ambassador (C.P.-58 (38)Page 6) .
During the discussion, regrets were expressed that the German Chancellor had promised s. written replyto the soundings on the colonial question.^he Secretary of State **or Air said he hoped thatthe Foreign Secretary woul^ he careful to link herr hitler&apos;s proposals for some limitation on air bombard-ment with the ouestion of limitation of armaments.A mere undertaking to limit the extent of air bombard-ments would not stand the test of war unless it was accompanied by a limitation of the means by which suchbombardments  could be effected.The Home Secretary thought it very important that sir Nevile Henderson&apos;s attention should be drawn tothis as pe ct.mhe Lord Chancellor was impressed by Herr Hitler&apos;sthreats to use force to vindicate the rights of germans in Austria and Gzecho-Slovakia.   He suggested that the reply to that ought to be that we agreed in the import-ance of safeguarding th^ rights of minorities, but thatwe must recall that the German nation was pledged bythe mreaty o^ Paris f^ellogg Pact).The Home Secretary suggested that the right way todeal with this was to say that if Germany invadedAustria or Cze cho-Slovakia they raised, dangers inEurope of which the end could not be foreseen.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said it was his intention to express his sympathy with therights of minorities, but  to warn Herr Ribbentrop inthe sense proposed by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the general line which the secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed to take in his forthcomingconversation with Herr Ribbentrop, asexpounded by him to the Cabinet and.s umma ris e d above :
(b) To take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs proposedto communicate at once with HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlinintimetine that our sounding on thesubject of colonies was limited tothe passage in quotations in C.P.-58(38), page 3 (&quot;a given area of Africaroughly corresponding to the conven-tional zone of the Congo Basin Treaties&quot;?and did not extend to &quot;the restorationof former German colonial territoryoutside that area&quot; as suggested, bySir Nevile Henderson &apos;C.P.-58 (38),page 6):(c) That the attention of His Majesty1sAmbassador in Berlin should be drawn to the importance of linking up thequestion of air bombardment with thatof limitation of armaments, as setforth above!(d) To take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would consider the practicability anddesirability of some agreed record of his conversations with HerrRibbent^op, which could be communi-communicated to Berlin for the informationof Herr Hitler and the GermanGovernment.

7. The Minister of Labour, referring to the news from France reported by the Foreign Secretary (seepreceding item), said that a difficalty had arisenat the International Labour Office owing to theinsistence of the French Government on appointingto the Paris branch of that Office an individual whowas not acceptable to the Director of the InternationalLabour Office,    ^he result had been that Mr H.-.Butlerhad handed in his resignation.^he Cabinet took note of theMinister of Labour&apos;s statement.INTERNATIONALt^BOTTR OFFICE.previous reference:Cabinet 28(32) , Con-elusion 2 *)
gjRE. 80     The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsnegotiations        reported that the main subject of discussion duringwith.the last week at the conversations with theI(previous representatives of Eire had been trade questions and,Reference:Cabinet 10 (38)   more particularly, the question of free entry for theConclusion 6.)products of Northern Ireland,,     The outlook was i^criru^thopeful, but some misunderstanding had arisen with the eire Ministers and Mr. de Valera had said that free entry was not what he had in mind at all, but only some kind of a reciprocal preference.     Free entry,he said, was impossible.       The Prime Minister had then addressed some well chosen words to the eire ministers.      He had made clear that there could be noquestion of handing back the ports unless somethingwas done for Northern Ireland and that perhaps therewould be no trade agreement, and no finance agreementeither.      This had had a salutary effect.      Thepresent position of the negotiations was that onfinance there was no change.     We were keeping thissubject back to the endo      On defence, Mr. de Valeracould not accept anything approaching the agreementdrafted last January but, if a general agreement was arrived at, he was prepared to give an interview, inthe course of which he would outline his policy on defence on lines very similar to those proposed in the january agreement.     Our intention, however, was tokeep defence in the background until some progress was made on the subject of trade.     On this matter,our aim was to get some concession for NorthernIrelande     On the previous day, Mr. de Valera had undertaken to discuss with his Ministers whether* they could not do something to meet us on this matter.
He thought,  therefore,  that the Ministers concerned v/erein for a period of hard bargaining,.     The Home Secretary,he added, was keeping in close touch with the ministers of Northern Ireland, and Mr. de Valera was staying onin London.The Home Secretary said that only 10 minutesbefore he had received a message from Mr. de Valeraasking to see him the same afternoon.     He had no doubtthat he meant to discuss the question of NorthernIreland,,     He proposed to adopt a firm attitude and to insist on free trade with Northern Ireland.     lord craigavon and Mr, Andrews were both depressed about thepresent state of the negotiations, and thought that agreement on the lines now proposed would lead to aserious upheaval in Northern Ireland.The Prime Minister said that the latest information went to show that there had been a verygreat fall in the export ts from Northern Ireland to eire, though the figures did not distinguish betweenexports and re-exports so that they v/ere not quiteconclusive.     The difficulty was that, unless someunderstanding could be reached, manufacturers would leave Northern Ireland and establish factories acrossthe boundary.     He himself had had some extremelyfriendly but frank talks with Mr. de Valera.     At his last interview, he had told him that unless he could do something with Northern Ireland the Treaty would be lost.He was satisfied that Mr. de Valera was most anxious not to go back without a Treaty.     He thought, however,that an agreement with Mr. de Valera would be worthmore than one with anyone else, as he alone had influence with the Parties of the Left.
The Home Secretary said that the officials of eire, viewing the matter from a practical point of view,did not object to the concessions to Northern Ireland?   itwas the Ministers who were apprehensive on political grounds .personally would probably like to do something for NorthernIreland for the reason that it would help to break down the differences between the North and the Southo     He was,however, apprehensive as to its effect on his ownpolitical position.was concerned more over the trade than over the ^olitioalaopoeto of an agreement.

CATjO tumC/RBTDE.Caledonianpower Bill.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(37), Con-clusion 7.)9.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP,-52(38))  informing his colleagues that the Second.Reading of the Caledonian Power Bill might be antici-pated soon after the middle of March, and. seekingtheir guidance on the following points:-(a) What arrangements should be made tostate the Government case in supportof the Bill in the debate on theSecond Reading?(b) Should any special arrangements bemade for securing support of theGovernment view, the case beingone in which the Government whipcannot be applied?As regards (a), if the matter was to be treated asprimarily a. Defence interest, it might be fittingthat on this occasion the Minister should supportthe Bill on behalf of the Government. 0   As to (b) , hesuggested that it would he well that the Secretary ofState for Scotland and himself should, discuss theposition with the Chief Whip well before the Debate,so that any action judged appropriate and. usefulcould be taken in good time.recalled that the scheme put forward envisaged onefactory in Scotland and another in South Wales.     Thelatter was to be proceeded with at once.     A few days before he had heard that the purchase of land washanging fire and enquiries had elicited that this was truein this and certain other respects *    Sir Arthur Robinson,on his behalfp had seen one of the directors to ascertain the position and, under his instructions, he had informed this director that he (Sir Thomas Inskip)hoped to see the Chairman of the Company immediately on his return from Scotland, and that the GovernmentThe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence
could give no support to the scheme in Parliament, unless they were satisfied that the Company was going aheadhona fide with the South Wales scheme0     There were acertain number of points of detail that could not be dealtwith on the Second Reading,and which the owners would haveto arrange with the authorities concerned when the Billcame before the Private Bills Committee.The Minister of Health, on behalf of the Presidentof the Board of Trade (absent indisposed) urged that theGovernment Spokesman in the Debate should use some cautionas to stating that the arrangement was &quot;vital&quot; or &quot;essential&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported this.If it were placed on record in the Debate that the schemewas &quot;vital&quot; or &quot;essential&quot;    and, in   the result, it did notturn out as well as it had been expected,    there   would bea demand on the Government that the taxpayer ought to take it over.      There were so many claims on the Treasury that hewas anxious to avoid this.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said hehad not contemplated to say that the scheme was &quot;vital&quot; or&quot;essential&quot;, though he would make clear that it was important from a defence point of view, since that was the ground uponwhich the Government had supported it.The Prime Minister said it was a question of balance.     There were arguments on both sides.     What was needed now was to link up the question of advantage with theconditions to be imposed.     As long as the Governmentlimited itself to saying that the scheme was desirable ona balance of the various considerations, they could not bepinned down to proceed with the scheme in all thecircumstances, since the considerations might change.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, inreply to a question, said that he had been informed thatthe negotiations with the Scandinavian countries were going on well.     The Company had obtained a very strong positionin the Norwegian Calcium Carbide industry which facilitatedagreement.      In reply to the Secretary of State for theColonies, he undertook to do what he could to mest thedesires of those interested in the amenities of the highlands, e.g. possibly by arranging for the plans to besubmitted to some competent authority on such questions.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the attitude which theMinister for Co-ordination of Defenceproposed to adopt in insisting that,as a condition of Government support tothe Bill, the Company should satisfyhim of its bona fide intentions toproceed immediately with the establishmentof a factory in South Wales:(b) That subject to (a), the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence should state the Government case in support of theBill in the Debate on the SecondReading:(c) To take note that the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence would take intoconsideration the suggestions made inthe course of the discussion as to(i)    the avoidance of any over-statement of the importance from the point of view ofdefence of the establishmentof these carbide factories, and(ii)    the desiderata of those concerned in the amenities ofthe Highlands, e.g0 by submittingthe plans to some recognisedauthority on architecturalmatters.
