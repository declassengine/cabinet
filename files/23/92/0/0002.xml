THE LORDProposedDinner.MAYOR *      &quot;i-   The prime Minister said that before ChristmasAnnual   the Lord Mayor called on him to suggest that he shouldrevive an earlier custom to invite the members o? the&apos;  I    y   Cabinet and their ladies to dine at the Mansion House.The Prime Minister had. promise&apos; to consult hiscolleagues.    Since then the Lord Mayor had put his proposal in writing.Tn the course of a short discussion reference was made to the difficulties involved in institutinganother annual engagement and in finding a suitabled at. e.After some discussion the Cabinet authorised thePrime Minister to accept the Lord Mayor&apos;s hospitableinvitation and to try and arrange an appropriate date,preferably on a. Wednesday,-a-
FOREIGN AFFAIRS&quot;       2*   Vis count Cranborne, who was present torepresent the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,(Previous$  Reference: said that he had nothing to add to the informationCabinet 1(38), Con- given to the Cabinet at the Meeting referred to in theelus ion 1.)\    margin on the general situation.   He had spoken that morning on the telephone to the Secretary of State,who ha.d informed him that his  conversations with theFrench Government had gone well and. that he wassending s. telegram which he thought was likely togive satisfaction to his colleagues.The Prime Minister reported the receipt of a message from Washington that President Roosevelt wasdeeply gratified with his two messages referred to inthe Meeting mentioned in the margin.
3 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade ICoP.-8 (38)) pointing out that at the time of the decision referred to in the margin   to the effect that a policy o^ &quot;masterlyinactivity&quot; should be maintained as long as possiblein respect of licences for export of war material to china and Japan   three applications v;ere outstandingfor licences to export ^ar material to Japan.   One hadalready been rejected, end the two following remained.:-(l) Prom Messrs Alvis-Straussler, Limited,in respect of one light tank and one armoured car, valued at  19,225;(2) Prom the Soley Armament Company, inrespect of 130 Lewis guns (air type)with spare parts eTn both eases no military or commercial grounds existedon which the applications  could be rejected, and inview of the circumstances described in his memorandum the President proposed to issue the two licences inquestion.Viscount Cranborne mentioned that Messrs Alvis-Stra.ussler, Limited, had. stated that they had receivedtheir order in October, 1936,    If they had been a.bleto anticipate the present situation they would not havea.ceepted the order.-^he Prime Minister mentioned that on the previous day he had received a deputation from the national council of Labour, which had suggested that His Majesty&apos;Government should prohibit the exportation to Japan notonly of weapons &quot;hut of anything that coul^ be used, inwar, including oil.   He had made a statement to them as to the undesirability of this proposal which hethought had brought  conviction to all his hearers.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of the Presidentof the Board or r^rs.6e to issue the twolicences r:^rrec to in his memorandum c.P*-8 (38), both of which, it was noticed,were of quite secondary importance:
(b) That the general policy on the exporta-tion of war material to Japan shouldcontinue to be one of &quot;going slow&quot;:( e) That in the absence of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs Viscount Cranborneshould be responsible for seeing that His- Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokio was informed of these licences and of the policy ofthe Government Q(Viscount Cranborne then withdrew.)-4-
99fa hiEIREr-ish FreeState) .^Conference-with.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(37). Con-elusion 8.)4. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairshanded round a draft outline for a Defence agreement as amended in discussion between Mr de Valera and himself on -Wednesday, 19th January.(The copies o^ this document were collected by the Secretary afterthe Meeting, and a copy is avail-able on the standard file of cabinet minutes o)The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked,leave to report on the recent proceedings between members of the Cabinet and Mr de Valera and hiscolleagues. He did not ask for any decisionsthat, day, but he proposed that Ministers should watch the development of the situation,, and a fortnight henoehe might wish to &quot;^ring forward suggestions .    The startto the Conference had been a. boisterous welcome to theIrish Ministers at Euston.    ^he discussions had lasted,three days and had been most, friendly in spirit on both sides throughout -   As a resul* the differenceshitherto existing on some outstanding questions hadbeen narrowed .   He then took the various points raised,at the Conference in turn.PARTIT TON,Mr de Valera  claimed that partition was a. f and amenta!question and. that while it lasted there could be nocomplete friendship and co-operation between the peopleof Eire and the people o^ this  country.   He had urged the &quot;nited kingdom Government to do something definitetowards bringing it to an end.    Apparently he had inmind soire+hins in the nature of a Joint Council toeonsider certain.in matters of common interest.   Tinderthis plan, apparently. Northern Ireland was to keep itsParliament with all its existing powers.   Mr de valera had thought that His Majesty&apos;s Government could influ- .ence Northern Ireland:    they had troops  there, paidmoney, and Northern Ireland depended on the United
4- 0&quot;Kingdom.   He suggested,  therefore, that from thepoint of view of a wider Imperial outlook it was their&quot;business to/do- thoir beot .    The Prime Minister had Ou^clclreplied, that, the Government could not coerce Ulster.The matter was primarily one between the Governmentof Eire and the Government of Northern ireland.nd .    Ifthe Government, and people of Northern Ireland changedtheir present views in favour of a modification ofthe exis+ing position, or moved in the direction ofa unified Ireland, we should put. no obstacle in theway.    At present, however,  our information was thatthe people of Northern Ireland felt very strongly.Mr de Valera must therefore get out of his head, any idea that, anything could be done at present *    The best,way in which Mr de Valera. and his Government   couldpromote their aims was to/ohcngc&apos;thoir pblioff-e-g-drifting away from the Empire and,^by entering on anagreement with ourselves, to show their desire for better relations.    That would be better tactics fromtheir own point, o^ view.    In the end Mr de Valeraappeared to appreciate the position, but made it clearthat he coul^ not reach an optimum agreement on suchmatters as Defence, Finance and Trade without someadvance in the question of Partition.The Secretary of State recalled that at the lasttalks between Officials we had been ready to leavethe Irish ports on certain conditions., one-^cf whichwas that we should have an assurance that we could use the ports in time of war.   His own subsequent talks with Mr de Valera had shown that it. was difficult for various reasons for him to give that, assurance.    TheCabinet had then asked the Chiefs of Staffs to reportDEFENCE.
on the matter and had left it. to the/e^Wine4^Gommitte-e--to take a decision after receipt of that Report,Ministers had felt that the CoO.S. Report justifiedthem in indicating that we should be prepared toconsider a Defence Agreement which, if it was satis-factory in other respects, did. not contain the proposedassurance.    The discussions with Mr de Valera and hiscolleagues had brought out the following points:-(i) Mr de Valera. regarded Eire as being nowfree&apos;,   but the maintenance of this freedom  which he admitted was no longer threatened by us   depended on our maintaining our freedom.   Any threat to us by Germany oranyone else was therefore a. threat to them.Tn fact he kept, talking of a &quot;common peril&quot;,(ii) He was therefore anxious for a defence agreement and for co-operation with us.Tf he got agreement he was prepared tosend for our experts and consult, themabout the defence of Eire:    to give priority to what, was necessary ^or the ports:    and to&quot;buy from us such war material as he couldnot. manufacture himself.   He recognised the desirability of interchangeability of equipment 0( iii) He had repeated, that politically it wasimpossible for him in present circumstances to promise the use of Trish ports in timeof&quot;war, but had hinted that if partitioncame to an end he mieht be able to considerit.   He wanted us therefore to base our plans on alternative hypotheses according as the ports were or were not available forour use,    Tn the ca.se where the ports were
9 r.6 jto he available his experts should, consult with ours in drawing up the plan so that co-operation could take place without delayif the event should arise.At the end of the discussion a draft Agreement on defence, of a tentative nature, had been drawn up inco-operation with the Mintster for Co-ordination ofDefence, which Mr de Valera had taken   back for dis-cussion with his Cabinet, and. which had also been referred, to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.FINANCE.The capital equivalent of what we were owed,amounted roughly to  100,000,000.    The Irish situation committee had proposed a settlement on the basis of something like  ^O,000,000.    This sum had been calcu-lated on the following assumptions:-(a) That there woul^ be no claim for land annuities;(b) That Eire would assume all otherliabilities t(c) That we should substitute for land annuities the payment of ex-Servicemen&apos;s pensions in Eire,mhese suggestions had not been presented in that way,^he Chancellor of the Exchequer had stated that wewere receiving^/ 4,000,000 a year from Special duties and that the problem was to find a compromise settle-ment which would compensate us in some reasonabledegree for giving that. up. Mr de Valera had &quot;been very stiff on this, as on other questions.   Hecould not agree to anything which could be represented as meaning Eire paying any penny of Land Annuities oranything in substitution for Land Annuities.    when asked for his proposal he had suggested first  2,000,000,
it bwhich had advanced rapidly to  8,000,000, and hadeventually reached  10.000,000-   At the 3ame time he expected that he would have to incur considerable expenseon Defence.&quot; The United Kingdom Ministers had said thatif everything else \va.s satisfactory they were preparedto contemplate an Agreement without Land Annuities, z ^*^^^arfll to gignotltulc foi   Uicii/a sum cff  25,000,000.That- calculation, however, had been made on 1936figures and jsigM require some modification.   Thatwas where the question stood today, so that there wasa fairly wide gulf between the two sides.TRADE.The discussions between Ministers on Trade hadbeen only very general.    The Irish Ministers had saidthat they could not interfere, with their protective duties.    United kingdom Ministers had replied thatthey could not guarantee free and unrestricted entryand that there must/be quota, regulation.   An under-standing had been reached, however, that if we removedthe Special Duties they  would remove the retaliatoryDuties and Bounties in so far as the latter were imposed  in response to our Special Duties.   TheUnited Kingdom Ministers had also tried to secure some concessions for Northern Ireland.    The expertswere now engaged on details, and the President of theBoard of Trade was in touch with the Thiited Kingdomindustries concerned.GENERAL.After the adjournment of the Conference the eire ministers had taken the draft Defence Agreement to dublin.    On the question of Finance there was someskirmishing going on between Officials, and on Tradedetailed discussions were in progress between Officials.
It was intended that Mr de Valera and his  colleagues should return in mid-February,    ^he discussions,besides reducing the differences on each of the threesubjects, had established, -s-ome personal relations whichmight be useful later.   Mr de Valera&apos;s suspicions ofour bona-fides had also been reduced.    We were still along way from agreement.    mhe principal danger was thaton their return to London the Eire Ministers might, makethe other agreements  conditional on some practical move on Partition.    In that event the negotiations wouldbreak down, but otherwise some agreement might bereached.The Prime Minister added, that the Eire ministers would have liked, to reach a Financial Agreement   ontheir own terms.   He and his colleagues, however, had felt that a. Financial Agreement provided a useful leveron Trade.    They ha.d therefore said that Finance must stand, over until they could see the picture as a whole .He had been disturbed to learn that Mr de Valera was meeting with a good, deal of difficulty in &quot;ju^IinoTfthey insisted that an Agreement must depend upon ourputting pressure on Northern Ireland, in favour of aJoint Council, an&quot; so forth, it would be impossible tobring the negotiations to success.   He felt, however,that Mr de Valera would not willingly allow the negotia--tions to drop.   He was a persuasive person and mightsucceed in carrying his own Gabinet.    ^he Prime Ministerexpressed the hope that, the Cabinet would approve what had been done.The Home Secretary said, that it. had been clear thatthe&apos;Eire Ministers were very desirous of an Agreement,and. none more than Mr de Valera himself.    In reply to aquestion as to what would be the attitude of NorthernIreland, on the Defence Agreement, he thought that this-lO
would, depend very largely on whether it was possibleto obtain some commercial concession for NorthernIreland, and that was why it was important to press for the latter.   His information was that a few yearsago there had been a movement in Northern Ireland inthe direction of getting rid of Partition, but, mainlyowing to the higher taxation in Eire, it now had no support.   He himself was keeping in the closestrelations with Lord Craigavon,The Prime Minister added that he was convincedthat Mr de Valera was really anxious to obtain a defence Agreement.    It was rather significant thatthe German Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires in London had alreadyevinced an interest in the conversations and had asked the High Commissioner for Eire for information.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the attitude adopted, by thePrime Minister and his  colleagues atthe recent Irish Conference, bothgenerally and on the particular subjects of Defence, Finance and trade
PJBLTOCAP ITEXPENiffTTRE *si(The Postmaster-General entered at this Point.)5.   The Cabinet-had before them the followingSxPEMDI- documents on the subject of Public Capital Expendi-ture:-A Memorandum by the Chancellor of therie  fc%)&apos;&amp; Exchequer (C.P.-6 (38))  circulating*&quot; for consideration two Reports (P.C.E.(37) 10 and, 15) of an interdepartmental committee appointed by him in June lastto enquire into the question, withspecial reference to the Report of theEconomic Advisory Committee dated 19thPebrua.ry last on Economic Policy andthe Maintenance of Trade Activity,which raised, the question how fax itwas desirable under present conditions to regulate capital expenditure so asto even out the fluctuations of tradeactivity between good, years and bad.The Chancellor asked, for a decisionon the hroad. issues o^ policy on lines set out in his Memorandum:A Memorandum by the Minister of Health(C.P.-7 (38)), attaching a tentativere-draft of the draft Circular to LocalAuthorities appended to P.CE.(37) 10,in order to bring it more into line with present conditions *The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a statement in the course of which he drew attention to theprincipal points arising out of the above Reports.He asked his colleagues to give general approval tothe Reports and to appoint a small Ministerial Commit-tee for the purpose of considering and approving the many important details that were involved, including,for example, the draft Circular submitted by theMinister of Health in 0.P.-7 (38), as well as for thepurpose of co-ordinating Parliamentary declarationsand replies to important Questions on the subject.The Prime Minister agreed, with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer that it would be foolish for the Govern-ment to take the line that nothing coul^ be done inthis matter, as no-one would, believe them.   consequently it was right for them to try and ascertain what waspra.ctica.ble.   The Reports brought out, however, thatthe possibilities were limited:    that, the amount of
employment that would result from the capital expendi-ture envisaged in the Reports was not large:    and tha.tthe particular classes of unemployed that would beaffected, by such expenditure would not be the same asthose thrown out. of work.    In fact, the benefits to unemployment from such expenditure were in no sensecomparable with the results of even a. slight rise ingeneral prosperity.The Minister of Health, while willing that thedraft Circular referred to in C.P.-7 (38) should beconsidered in detail by the Ministerial committee proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, asked thatit might be approved in principle by the Cabinet,   Helaid emphasis on the importance of the five-yearprogrammes o^ &quot;Local Authorities which the Circular was designed to promote, from the point of view not only oftheir incidental effect in slowing down some projectsthat  could better be postponed, but more particularlyin conducing towards rapidity of action when the time came for speeding up the projects of Local Authorities &apos;in the interests of unemployment.   He advised theCabinet on certain changes in the housing situationsince the completion of the Reports.The Minister of Labour pointed out that the adoptionof the proposals of the Chancellor of the exchequer would inevitably involve the G-overnment in having theirown prog-ramm.es corresponding to those of the LocalAuthorities, since the latter would, know the positionof G-overnment. works (Labour Exchanges, TelephoneExchanges, etc.) in their respective localities andwould enquire what the Government proposed, to do inthese matters.
The President of the Board of Education hopedthat a good deal of elasticity would Toe allowed for in educational programmes, which often had to be adjusted at short notice to meet the needs of a changing situation.At the moment he would rather like to slow down some of the developments in secondary education.The Minister of Transport while supporting theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposals, made a strong pleathat the execution of the programme of highway works(apart from major projects like the Severn Bridge) shouldnot be impeded.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would regard the highway works programme as day-to-day work notfalling within the scope of the new scheme.The Postmaster-General said that he had already taken certain steps which would have the effect of postponingcapital works, and gave examples of these and of other similar steps which he proposed to take.     He agreed to thesuggestion that further reductions in telephone charges should be postponed but he pressed very strongly that itwould be most dangerous to curtail the present programme of engineering development, as this would stand in the way ofthe existing pressing demand for telephone service.     Suchdelay would have a serious financial effect, as the telephoneconcessions already made would only pay with increasednumbers of subscribers.     Further, unless the post Officecontinued to provide cables and exchanges (which take twoyears to complete) it would not be possible, when the time came, to embark at short notice on a policy of rapid expansionThe Secretary of State for the Colonies, as a formerFirst Commissioner of Works, concurred that the bottle-neckof expansion in telephone services would be the Exchanges.He laid great stress on the importance of early acquisition of sites as a factor in works of all kinds, in which he was supported strongly by the Postmaster-General and the Ministerof Health.- 14 r*
9 9The Secretary of State ^or War, while accepting the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposals inprinciple, demurred strongly to the suggestions inparagraph 17 of P.0.E.(3 7) 10 that the building pro-grammes of the Defence Departments might be reviewed,The building programmes were part of general defence expenditure which arose not from economic but fromother- considerations.    Tf the building programmes wereinterfered with it would involve great disappointmentto the rank and file and interfere with the develop-ment of the programmes themselves.   He produced evidenceof the deplorable state of some of the Army barracks.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposalsof the Chancellor of the exchequer in CP.-6 (38)  and       the two Reportsof the inter--Departmental Committeeon Public Capital Expenditure (P.C.E.(37) 10 and 1*) :(b) That a Standing Ministerial Committeeshould be constituted as follows  The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Health,The Minister of &quot;Labour,The Minister of Transport,The First Corrmissioner of Works,The Postmaster-General  (i) To consider more in detail therecommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee and whateach Department  can do to  carrythem out:( ii)  and thereafter to remain in beingfor the purpose of dealing with any questions that may arise on theinterpretation of the Reports, andfor the co-ordination as necessaryof the action of Government Depart-ments, and. of answers to Parlia-mentary Questions:( c) That, the Ministers at the head of anyother Departments  concerned, e.g., theService Departments, should, be invitedto attend when their business was underdiscussion:
(d) That the inter--Departmfmtal Committeeon Public Capital Expenditure shouldbe re-constituted as a Standing Com-nnittee, as recommended in para. 93of P.C.E, (37)  10,  &quot;with the dutyof advising on the co-ordination of programmes with the object of avoid-ing excessive demands upon the productive capacity of the industries concerned, and the utilisation of anyexcess  capacity in these industriesso far as it could contribute to theexecution of programmes a,lreadydecided upon&quot;:( e)  mo approve in principle the draftCircular to Local Authorities attached,to the Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (CP .-7 (38)), subject to itsexamination in detail by the ministerial committee proposed in (b) above.-16-
9 lid &apos;iZINC IMPORTS. 6*   Tlie Cabinet had before them a&quot; Note-by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-5 (38))covering the Report of a Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence appointed to enquire into thequestion of Zinc Imports into this  country from thepoint of view of defence, and. to advise, inter alia.,,as to the situation in regard to import duties on zinc:together with an Extra.ct from the Minutes of the 306thMeeting of the Committee of Imperia.1 Defence at whichthe following conclusions were rea.ched:-(i) That the Report of the Sub-Committee onZinc Imports &apos; C.I.D. Paper No.l381-B)should be remitted to the Cabinet:(ii)  That the Sub-Committee on the accumulation of Reserve Stocks of Essential Raw materials should be instructed, to consider the desir-ahility of the acquisition of a reserve of high-grade zinc in the United, &quot;kingdom andto submit proposals.Tn his Memorandum the Minister pointed, out thatthe conclusions and recommendations of the Sub-Committeetfealt with general trade questions outside the sphere of defence:    that-the President of the Board of Tradeapproved, the finding of the Sub-Committee that an agree-ment among Empire producers-along the lines suggestedwas the proper solution of the problem;   and that he proposed to settle with the President the terms of thenecessary communioptions to the Imperial Smelting Cor-poration and the Consolidated Mining and Smelting company of Canada.In the course of the discussion,  the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs drew attention to theproceedings of a Committee of the Imperial Conference 1937on Munitions and Pood Supplies, and referred to thefollowing recommendation:-
&quot;That it is recognised it would he of great value to His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom to he able to rely on suppliesof raw materials from the Dominions and indian the event of an emergency, but at the sametime, any commitment or undertaking cannotbe entered into during peace-time either topurchase or to supply raw materials during a period of war0&quot;    (Eo  (37) 3&apos;f Most Secret,paragraph 22, conclusion (f)3)In view of the susceptibilities of certain Governments,,particularly that of Canada, he pointed out that any approach to those Governments v/ould have to be made very tactfully-,      In such rases, it would be inadvisable to press for an official agreement to allot the wholeof the supply of zinc to the United Kingdom in time ofwar, though, if the matter were handled properly, itwould probably be an.right when the emergency aroseThe Cabinet agreed5(a) To approve the proposal of theMinister for Co-ordination ofDefence that an agreement amongEmpire producers along the lines suggested in the Report of theSub-Committee (C,10Dd381-B) wasthe proper solution of theproblem;(b) That the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade,should draw up the terms of thenecessary communication to theImperial Smelting Corporation andto Mr, JoJo Warren of the consolidated Mining and SmeltingCompany of Canada?(c) That the above decisions must not betaken as commit ting the Cabinet inany sense to either (i) a subsidy,or (ii) the exclusion of foreignmetal by a high tariff in the eventof failure to reaoh a satisfactory agreement with foreign producers,and that this should be made clear to the Imperial Smelting Corporationbefore the negotiationss(d) To take note that,on the recommendationof the Committee of Imperial Defence,the question of the acquisition ofa reserve of high grade zinc in theUnited Kingdom has already been referred by the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence to the Sub-Committee on the Accumulation of reserve Stocks of Essential RawMaterialso
That, having regard to thediscussions at the ImperialConference on the supply of rawmaterials in time of war and tothe susceptibilities of Governmentsof certain Dominions, any approaches to them with a view to ensuring the supplies of the United kingdom in time of war should he made through the Dominions Office insuch formal or informal manner asthe Secretary of State might deembest suited to the circumstancesof each casee- 19 -
70    The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries reported that a Bill for the prohibition of dockingand nicking of horses was to he introduced in theHouse of Lords by a Private Member (Lord Merthyr),and was due to come up for Seoond Reading onFebruary 1st,     The Bill sought to prohibit thedocking and nicking of horses and the importation ofdocked and nicked horses,      &quot;Docking&quot; was defined as meaning the removal of any bone or bones or any portion thereof from the tail of a horse;    and&quot;nicking&quot; as cutting and severing any tendon ormuscle of the tail of a horse0     The purpose ofdocking and nicking was the sameo     The practice ofdocking horses&apos; tails was one which had been carriedon in the case of certain breeds for many years.,The Ministry was not aware of any large volume ofopinion amongst breeders and owners of horses inthis country against the practice      In fact, it wasfairly certain that breeders of those classes of horses which it had been the custom to dock wouldhe opposed to any proposal to end the practice0The only representations received in recent yearsby the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries againstthe docking of horses&apos; tails were from the royal society for&apos; the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (in1935), the National Equine Defence League and a fewprivate individuals0      It was urged against thepractice that the.operation involved the inflictionof pain and that it deprived the animal of itsnatural means of protection against fliesQ     Crueltyin the performance of the operation of docking,however, had been removed by the Animals (Anaesthetics)Act, 1919 which required that the animal during thewhole of the operation should be under the influence

He suggested that theCabinet should allow him to investigate with parliamentary Counsel the position on the drafting ofthis and other agricultural Bills, and to ascertain whether there was any. chance of gotting the bill passed.     Otherwise, he did not propose to over-burdenthe Parliamentary Draftsmen,The Lord Chancellor repeated tho proposal hehad made in discussing the Bill for the Prevention of^ Damage by Deer, namely, that tho RaTobits Bill mightbe tried out as a Private Member&apos;s Bill introduced inthe House of Lords.
