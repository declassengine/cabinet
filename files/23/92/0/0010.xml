? Q 1GERMANY.Fropos edConversa-tions.(previous reference:Cabinet 4(38). Con-plus ion 2 .)1.    The Prime Minister, referring to the meeting mentioned in the margin, recalled that the cabinet were aware of the forthcoming converaations withGermany.   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin had returned, home and had gone back to Germany with his instructions .   Perhaps the most, difficult question tobe considered in the conversations was that of colonies,to which the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy had given much thoueht .   The line that seemed most practical and. likely to lead to success was to delimit a zone inTropical Africa which, very approximately and. without-going into details, would be bounded by the Sahara.Desert on the North and^German South-West Africa onthe South.    The idea was to treat this zone as a field,for a new experiment in colonial administration.The existing Mandates would he surrendered, and. allthe Powers holding territories in the area would, agreeto adopt and apply certain principles on such matters as demilitarisation, the treatment of Natives, Tradeand communications.    Room would be found in the area for territory for administration by Germany.    Oneadvantage of this arrangement was that it could, be presented to the world not as handing back to Germanyher former colonies as a. right, but as a new planbased on higher ideals and allotting territory subjectto certain principles.   A great deal of work would,still remain to be done.   At some point it would, benecessary to consult Belgium and Portugal.   Part ofthe area in question was already subject to the CongoTreaties.   Yet another advantage of the scheme wasthat it avoided one of the most formidable criticisms,na.mely, the handing   over of Natives from one Power
to another/.   The Treaty was also based on a big idealwhich it was hoped might  commend, itself both to thiscountry and to Germany.    It had not. been thought necessary to give particulars to the French at thepresent stage, more particularly as it was inadvisable to run the risk of causing, irritation in France bycommunicsting the outlines of a scheme that theGermans might refuse.    The Cabinet Committee had thought,therefore, that the best plan was to instruct Sir NeviltHenderson to sound the Fuhrer on the subject.   We weretelling the French Government that all that had beendone was to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin,when he saw Herr Hitler, to take soundings as to whafcwra-nlri ba the German attitude towards p-^p^al t ^nthe gonoral linoo okctchcd out abovo.    That communication-tion would be accompanied by an assurance that if anything emerged from these inquiries we should not propose any contribution from the French unlessaccompanied, by a substantially equivalent contribution from ourselves .The Prime Minister then suggested to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs that he should circulate to the Cabinet-/his Despatch of February 25th toSir E. Phipps, printed, in P.P. (36) 53.The Cabinet took note  (a) of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement:(b) that the Secretary of State for..Foreign Affairs would circula.te%his Despatch No. 394 to Sir E. Phipps,dated February 25th, 1938, at presentprinted as F,P. (3 6) 53.
q n oSPAIN. 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that Field Marshal Sir PhilipChetwode had accepted an invitation to becomeArbitrator for the exchange of prisoners between thetwo parties in Spain.   Appropriate action was beingtaken in the Foreign Office to set the matter inF.R.n(2,4)S. motion, and it was hoped that the Field Marshal would,be at. work within a fortnight .hxchange of[Prisoners .(previous reference:Cabinet 5(38),  Con-elusion 3 .)
THE ERITTSHBROADCAST IMGCORPORATION.ProposedBroad cas ton german colonies .(previous reference:Cabinet 29(37) , Con-clusion 1.)F.R. li(3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the British broadcasting corporation had announced a broadcast to take placeon March 11th on the question of the handing back of colonies to Germany, in which Mr Amery, Mr HaroldNicolson and Mr Glasgow would take part.   He sought the views of his colleagues as to whether it would, bedesirable, in present circumstances, to invite theB.B.C. to suspend the broadcast or not.Tn the course of a short discussion it waspointed out that there might perhaps be some advantage in allowing the broadcast to take place, so that theGerman Government would learn something about the popular objections to handing over colonies.   Anotherview was that the discussion ought not to take place.Tn any event it. was suggested that the foreign secretary should see Sir John Reith and a.sk him toavoid allowing a series of broadcast discussions onthis question.The Foreign Secretary sai^ that, in the light ofthe Cabinet discussion he would  consult the ForeignOffice.    If, on balance, it seemed better to postpone the broadcast, he would see Sir John Reith and enquireif he would be willing&apos; to put a stop to the broadcast on his own responsibility.
ANGLO-ITALIANCONVT?RSArn TONS ,Eritishf   Desiderata.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(38), Con-elusion l(b) .)SPA TN.Position of inthe Negotia-tions .(previous reference:Cabinet 7(38), p.l) .4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.-50 (38)) on British Desiderata in theforthcoming Anglo-Italian Conversations.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that since its  circulationthe a^ove Memorandum had been discussed hy theCabinet Comm.ittee on Foreign Policy, and he gavehis colleagues particulars of the a^en^mentsintroduced as the result of that discussion, all of which were approved.In the course of the discussion the hope was expressed that there would be no weakening on whatwas understood to h*ve been the view of the Cabinetthat an agreement on Spain must form an integral part of the final arrangements with Italy andthat no agreement  could be reached without it .The Prime Minister said that it had never beenin his mind as a sine qua, non to an agreement that italy should withdraw from Spain irrespective ofwhat other countries might be doing.    He was satisfied, however, that the Italian Government wa.svery anxious to withdraw their troops an* would do their utmost to facilitate an agreement.   He hoped,therefore, that the question would not arise as an obstacle to agreement.The First Lord of the Admiralty reported thatjust, before coming to the Meeting of the Cabinethe had received information from very secret sourcesthat, orders had been issued from Rome that Italianaircra.ft in Majorca we^e to abstain from, attacksfor the present even on military targets .-o-
O f\  Tn connection with the limitation of fortifications-tions (C cp-50 (38) Pc6)  the Secretary of State forForeign Af-fairs read to the Cabinet a fresh draftparagraph  t.o be substituted for a passageon page 5 of that Paper, dealing with the questionof exchange of information on the subject of theestablishment of new fortified ports or postsThe Secretary of State for *Var reminded theForeign Secretary that the exchange of information was to be accompanied by explanations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs took a note of this point.Tn connection with the Abyssinian subjects(Pages 18 &amp; 19 of CP.-50 (38)) the Secretary ofState for the Colonies reminded the Foreign secretary that it had been understood at the Foreign PolicyCommittee that Signor Mussolini was to be warned that we should wish these questions to be taken upimmediately after the main agreement had beenrea ched.The Secretary of St*te for Foreign Affairs agreed,and also mentioned that it was proposed, to record the fact that Signor Mussolini had abolished slaveryin Abyssinia.After the Foreign Secretary had explained theproposals for Arabia, the Secretary of State forIndia expressed his agreement in the formula onpage 15 of CoPo--50 (38), viz.:-&quot;That the two Governments a.gree in sofar as they are concerned, to do nothing to disturb the territorialstatus quo, in Arabia and that neither of them will seek to obtain for itself a privileged position on the Arabiancoast of the Red Sea&quot;.
Tn reply to a question as to the Earl of Perth&apos;simpressions on the prospects of an agreement, thethe following:-Foreign Secretary reported/ first, that the italians had undoubtedly believed that we were postponingnegotiations until our re-armament had advanced sofar as to put us in an advantageous position&apos;, and,second, that he/was convinced that the ItalianGovernment wanted an agreement and would do all theycould to secure it, and that if an agreement were reached they hoped that it would result in re-establishing the old friendly relations between thetwo countries.The Cabinet agreed  (a) mo approve, as the ba.sis for instructions to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Rome in the forth-coming, conversations, the Memorandumon British desiderata. (CP.-50 (38)),including the amendments introduced by the Cabinet Committee on ForeignPolicy:(b) ^o take note that it was theintention of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to circulate instructions based, onC.P.-SO (38), but incorporatingthe approved amendments,
5.  The Cabinet again had. before them a Most secret note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(CoP.-4l (38))   covering an Extract from the Minutesof the 310th Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence and a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CoTcDo Paper No0 1399-B) relating to theDefence of Egypt.   At the Meeting referred, to in the margin the main decision on the recommendations ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence had. been postponed,until the Prime Minister and Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had. been able to ascertain from the earl of Perth (nov-7 in this country) his view of thepossible effect of these recommendations on theattitude of the Italian Government in the forthcomingConversations -After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note that the Prime Ministerand Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had ascertained from the earl of Perth that he saw no objection,from the point of view of his forth-coming conversetions with the ItalianGovernment,  either to the recoramenda-tions of the Committee of ImperialDefence or to the normal arrangementsfor publicity on the subject:(b) that the following recommendation ofthe Committee of imperial Defence atthe 310th Meeting held on february.ry 17th,1938. should, accordingly be approved:-&quot;(i) To accept the Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee (C.T.D.

EIRE.Negotiationswith.(previous reference:Cabinet 4 (38)Conclusion 16,)6.     The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs reported that Mr. de Valera and hiscolleagues were returning to London the same evening.     He hoped, therefore,  that the last ofthe series of conversations would now take place.Within the next few days, it would be necessary todecide whether to reach an agreement or to abandon the attempt.     He recalled that the Cabinet had given a certain amount of discretion to the negotiating Ministers, who throughout had kept inclose consultation with the Irish SituationCommitteeo     He then proceeded to report on thepresent position of the negotiations.On the subject of finance, Eire owes usmoney with a capital equivalent to-day of nearly 100 millions.     We were willing,  if settlementson the other subjects were concluded, to accept 18-j? millions, in addition to  250,000 a year,making  23^ millions in all.     Mr. de Valera offeredonly  10 millions including, he thought, the 250,000 per annum.     The United Kingdom special duties and the Eire discriminatory duties were todisappear.Coming to trade, he said that a draft agreement had been worked on for some weeks, though there were still one-og--two points outstanding:more particularly, certain questions affecting theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries, namely, eggs and poultry;    and fish.     Generally speaking, thedraft agreement was on the same basis as the ottawa agreements.     Eire would get free entry for herproduce into this country subject to quantitative regulation.     We should get/a review of existing
protective duties in Eire -and.. review by a Prices Commission.     The Board of Trade were satisfied with the agreement.     It would not be easy todefend the fact that the benefits to this country wouldbe deferred pending the work of the Prices Commission,but, in this matter, we were protected by a break clause.y(s he draft trade agreement would also include certainuseful concessions to Northern Ireland which would inureto their benefit but not to ours; //&quot; ^jC. p^jaa**?t. &apos;lLxJrComment was made by members of the Cabinet onthis latter point to the effect that the proposal was astep towards mutual free trade between Northern and southern Ireland,     Mr. de Valera would, no doubt, regard it as a step towards union and might even present itas such.      It would be presented to our own Parliament,in accordance with the negotiators&apos; intentions, as an advantage to Northern Ireland, wk-i^h-Mfteiudsd!--a- distressedarea$.Coming to defence, the Dominions secretary said that the situation was rather difficult.     he recalled that at the end of the first series of conversations, a draft defence agreement had been drawnup under which we were to withdraw from the defended ports of Eire without obtaining any assurance that weshould be allowed to use the ports in the event of war,although a number of other advantages and assurances tothis country were incorporated.      Mr. de Valera had undertaken to put the proposal to his Cabinet of Eire and -support it.     He now reported that the Cabinet had rejected the draft agreement on the ground that we were unable to do anything on the subject of partition.Consequently, he had had to reject the agreement.     Therewere, in consequence, now two alternatives -
(l)   To agree to hand the ports hack to Eire andtrust that they would bring their defencesup to date and allow us to use them in timeof war:(2)    To remain in the ports - which would notnecessarily prevent an agreement on finance and trade, but would not conduce togood relations between the two countries.On balance, the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs had come to the conclusion that our presentposition was so unsatisfactory that we should obtain no practical advantage by insisting on its maintenance and that,consequently, the better course was to accept the L-a^u^ pu-c*situation in the hope which he thought might-, in practice,be realised that we should obtain more by this method.In this latter connection, he mentioned that if thiscourse were adopted, Mr. de Valera would probably in thenear future make a speech in which he would announce his policy which, in substance, would be very similar to thatincorporated in the original draft agreement on defence.He thought Mr. de Valera would do his utmost to implementthat policy.     Although there was an element of gamblein the decision, he thought,  therefore, that to surrenderthe ports was preferable to the only alternative.The Minister for Co-ordination of defence pointed out that the defences of the ports were out of date and occupied by an insignificant force.  Whichevercountry was responsible for bringing the ports up  to date, theywould not be able to complete it for some years, owing tothe difficulty of obtaining the necessary material.     Ifwe were to maintain our position in the ports, we should in war, if Eire was hostile, have to put in a stronggarrison.     Once we surrendered the ports we should haveno right to go back except by invitation.     Having regardto the unsatisfactory position in time of war in the event
of a hostile Eire, he thought it was worth while towithdraw.     In making this recommendation, he pointedout that Eire was dependent on overseas supplies and was almost bound to be on our side.      In surrendering the ports we were not giving up anything worth having.said about the ports.     At present, they were not muchvalue to us.     Eire was not very friendly to us but was never likely to be friendly to Germany so far asthat the ports should not be surrendered as part of aobtain a trade agreement so satisfactory that NorthernIreland would not stir up agitation in Parliamentagainst handing back the ports.question of bargaining away the ports for a good trade agreement.     It would be possible to get an agreement on the other matters without handing over the ports,and Mr. de Valera had made clear that this was not acondition of a settlement on trade and finance.     he himself took the view that it was to our advantage to hand over the ports.     From the defence point of view,the goodwill of Eire was the most important thing.     Tocontinue the occupation of the ports would be represented as an affront to the people of Eire and would keep open the old sore.     We should be sacrificing nothing.     Inthose circumstances, wAs.-i.t--lAtee3ry that Eire would allow an enemy of this country to use the portst.    Whether theywould allow us to do so was less certain but theirdependence on overseas supplies might lead them to do so.Even if we retained the ports, their order of prioritywas so low that years would elapse before we could the Home Secretary agreed in what had beencould at present be foreseen.He was anxious, however,The Prime Minister said that there was no
provide them with defences.     He had little doubt that,if theywere handed over Mr. de Valera would find the money.Consequently,  though he would have preferred the agreement,he supported the view of the Dominions Secretary.The Lord Chancellor asked the Cabinet to note that he had placed his dissent to this decision on recordat the Irish Situation Committee and would not repeat his views to the Cabinet.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries agreed as to the handing over of the ports, but urged that it shouldbe represented as resulting from our strength and notweakness.     He explained certain difficulties that were still outstanding   on   the trade agreement in regard to poultry,eggs and fish.The Prime Minister said that the Committee proposedto take a stiff line on the question of the proposed Eirerestrictions on fish, but hoped for a compromise on eggs and poultry.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposed agreement withEire as outlined by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs and summarised above,including the handing over of the defended ports unconditionally to the Government of eire and the withdrawal of the existinggarrisons.
PALESTINE.7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byControl ofImmigrationinto .the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-46(38)) on the subject of Control of Immigration into palestine.   After recapitulating the history of the(previous reference: question, he recommended that the principle ofCabinet 9(38) , Con- restriction, which was due to expire on the 31;elusion 17.)March, should be maintained for a further period of twelve months after that date.   With a view tomitigating Jewish hostility towards this extension,however, the Secretary of State would like to announce simultaneously that it is the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, as soon as the boundaries of the various areas have been defined and so longas the existing Mandate continues in operation,temporarily to regulate the admission of jewish immigrants by the economic absorptive capacity ofPalestine, less the Arab area, as recommended by theRoyal Commission.   He proposed, thai His Majesty&apos;sGovernment (not the High Commissioner) should accept responsibility not only for the decision on the abovequestion of policy, but also for the specific limit-ations that he suggested should be imposed, in thecase of each category of immigrants, without mention of a global maximum.made the following correction to paragraph 18:-Last three lines of paragraph 18, after &quot;it isestimated that&quot; insert -&quot;In order to maintain the presentdifference between the numbers of jews and non-Jews, a Jewish immigration ofapproximately 17,000 is required thisyear.     This is largely due to thehigher Arab birth rate.&quot;The Secretary of State for the colonies
The Secretary of State then read a letter fromthe retiring High Commissioner in which General Sir arthur wauchope gave reasons against continued adherence to theprinciple of economic capacity for absorption as the testfor calculating the quotas of immigrants, and suggested asa substitute for it some general figure such as 8,000immigrants for six months.This proposal did not commend itself either tothe Secretary of State for the Colonies or tothe Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs expressed some apprehensions lest the proposals of theColonial Secretary should lead to the immigration of larger numbers than   those stated in the rough estimate inparagraph 18 of CP. 46 (38), more particularlydependents and students.       Any large increase would be a serious matter from the point of viewof our relations with the Arab Rulers.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said the matter had been gone into very carefully and he was advised that the maximum was not likely to exceed 8,600in six months and, if the unemployment situation inPalestine was such as to lead to a curtailment of labourimmigrants, the numbers might come down to about 6,000.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies to presentthe decision of the Cabinet in a form calculated as far aspossible, to avoid difficulties in the Arab countries.The Cabinet agreed:(a)    To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for the colonies as set forth in CP. 46 (38), paragraphs17-20:
That the principle of economic capacity for absorption should continue to be the test to govern the periodical quotas of immigrants:That the Secretary of State for theColonies should do his best to presenthis proposals in a form calculated asfar as possible to avoid difficulties inArab countries:To take note that the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies would consider asuggestion made by one of his colleagues that consideration should be given inthe announcement to a slight amendment to the phrase -&quot;Palestine less the Arab area&quot;in the last line of paragraph 15,
80   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP..--40 (38))outlining the course of the negotiations for a trade agreement with India and describing the kind ofagreement which the Government of India were prepared,to accept.   The terms of this agreement, however, froma trade point o-e view, were so unsatisfactory, and theParliamentary difficulties involved were so great,that the President was unable to recommend acceptance.He would be prepared, in order to avoid the conse-quences of failing to reach agreement with India, toagree that we should sacrifice preferences on tradeworth something between 6 and 7 erores, but he could,get no indication of any possibility of India being satisfied, with anything less than 9 crores .   he therefore reported the matter to his colleagues and asked for their views ,The Minister of Health dealt with thequestion on behalf of the President of the Board ofTrade absent indisposed.-     The Board of Trade were satisfied that we could not hope for any further offerfrom India.     The choice,  therefore, lay betweenaccepting the latest offer of the Indian government or breaking off negotiations.     If there was a break,it was certain that before long   we should lose ourpreferences in the Indian market, and we should be obliged to end the Ottawa Agreement with India andtreat that country- as though   it were a foreign country.     Either course involved great difficulties.The opinion of the Board of Trade was that if we brokeoff negotiations, we should get the worst of the bargain, as India could buy elsewhere than in thiscountry.     His suggestion in all the circumstances was
that he should he authorised to tell the Commerce Member ofthe Government of India that we were prepared to contemplate anagreement with some reluctance in order to assist Indiabut that our final decision must depend upon the resultof the visit to be paid to India by a Deputation of theCotton Industry.      If the result of that visit was not satisfactory we would not proceed with an agreement.In the course of the discussion, a strong pleawas made by the Secretary of State for Scotland on behalfof the jute industry.     He suggested that it was wrong, inprinciple, that representatives of Lancashire only should go to India to discuss terms with the Indian industry,and that it would be more appropriate to include other branches of the textile industry such as jute.      It waspointed out, however, that there was a great difference betweenthe needs of the two industries.     The cotton industrywanted increased preference in the Indian market,whereas the jute industry wanted to restrict the importationof Indian jute manufactures into this country.The Minister of Health was prepared to do his best to arrange for representatives of the jute industryto visit India, but said there could be no question ofmaking acceptance of the trade agreement with Indiadependent on a settlement on jute.The Secretary of State for Scotland pointedout that it would be dangerous if this was notified tothe Indian Government as they would then ignore therepresentatives of the jute industry.The Secretary of State for India, in the courseof a statement to the Cabinet, mentioned that there was some possibility that the problems relating to jute mightbe solved by action initiated by certain groups in theindustry without Government interference.
