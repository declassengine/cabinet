THE CABINET. 1. The Prime Minister welcomed the Right Hon.Earl Winterton, M.P., Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, to the Cabinet.
THE SITUATION 2. In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned inIN central europe, the margin, the Cabinet had before them a MemorandumAustria and by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-67Czechoslovakia.(38))  circulating for the information of his colleagues(Previous a Paper on the British attitude towards Austria and reference:Cabinet 12 Czechoslovakia and. the League of Nations aspect of(38), Con-clusion (d).)    recent events.F.r.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the Cabinet a. summary of events in relation to the crisis in Central Europe which had. occurred, since their last Mee+ing.    Immediately a^ter that Meeting he had.seen the Leaders of the Liberal and. Labour Oppositionsin the House of Commons .   Mr Attlee had adopted a friendly and sympathetic attitude and. had not seemedto think that a debate was necessary that afternoon:nor had. he pressed the League of Nations aspect.Sir Archibald. Sinclair had. adopted, a purely League ofNations outlook.     He himself had sent a. telegram toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris in order to informthe French Government as to our attitude towardssummoning the Council of the League.    Sir Eric Phippshad reported, that m. Delbbs and the French ForeignOffice agreed in our point of view, but. there was some uncertainty as to what would be the attitude of M, PaulBoncour, the new Foreign Minister.He had. instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in berlin to enquire from Field-Marshal Goering as to the assur-ances given about a. plebiscite in Austria, and he hadreceived a reply which could be used in statements that afternoon.   -He could net, howovor.. quite a-ecept Orereply in pprtain respects..^ The Italian Foreign Minister had made clear thathe deprecated, the request made by the Earl of Perthto see Signor Mussolini.    In the circumstances he ( theForeign Secretary) had instructed, the Earl of Perth
to accept Count Ciano&apos;s statement as representing theviews of the Italian Government.On Saturday afternoon the Foreign Secretary had seen the French Ambassador and the Czechoslovak Minister,ant? the record of this conversation would shortly bein the hands of his colleagues.    The concern of theFrench Government was as to what Germany might now be doing, to Czechoslovakia.   He had replied that he couldnot state our views at the moment but that he thoughtit was desirable that the two Governments should be inclose touch and that it was his intention to raise withthe Prime Minister the question of inviting french ministers to London to discuss it.    The CzechoslovakMinister had confirmed, that assurances had been givenboth to the Czechoslovak Minister in Eerlin and to the czechoslovak Foreign Minister in Prague that Germanywished, to continue their present policy towards Czecho-slovakia in so fa.r as their mutual relations were con-cerned .   He (the Foreign Secretary) had then asked if,having been officially seized, o^ the fact of the Germanassurances,   we should be authorised to ask Eerlin for confirmation.    The Minister had. a.greed .    That eonfirma-tion had been asked for, and the German Government hadbeen requested to allow us to mention their assurancesin Parliament the same afternoon.   His Majesty1 ambassador was to see Field. Marshal Goering on thesubject at 9.30 that corning.The French Government had. asked whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in the interests of peace, would, consent to a warning being given in Eerlin by the British andFrench Ambassadors to the effect that &quot;The Britishand French Governments  could not remain indifferent to any German action against Czechoslovakia&quot;,   Thatwas  clearly a. matter on which some discussion would berequired..
eJ 0 0The Czechoslovak Minister had reported that Dr*Beneswas not particularly disturbed at the situation and did not expect, any immedia.te danger to his country.The Cabinet would have seen a telegram from theBritish Minister in Vienna suggesting that DrcSchuseh-nigg would he involved in danger if it were announcedpublicly in this  country that he had asked for theadvice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the crisis.As he (the Foreign Secretary) had already informed the political leaders that our advice had. heen sought,he ha.d written to them warning them of the importanceof secrecy and enclosing a. copy of Mr Palairet&apos;s tele-gram.    Dr. Schus chnigg ? he added (in reply to the PrimeMinister) was still in Vienna and not, as had beenreported earlier, in Hungary. vReferring to the recall  of the British minister from Vienna, he     aaid      that, as Mr Palairet wasdeba.rred from giving a.dvice and. as the Germans mightclaim that, his reports were mendacious and demand hisrecall, he had. thought it better to bring him back toLondon to report .The Foreign Secretary then described, to the Cabinetthe general lines of a statement that he had drawn upfor use in Parliament, but which he had not had timeto circulate0    The greater part of the statement was concerned with the narrative of events, on which theCabinet were informed.   On page 7 of his draft, however,he had dealt with a question o^ policy on which heconsulted the Cabinet.Some discussion took place as to how far it wouldbe wise to include in the statement on policy a. con-condemnation of the German attitude, which, in the first draft, had been stated mildly, but in a second draft,read to the Cabinet by the Foreign Secretary, wascouched in somewhat stronger terms.-4-
Tn favour of the stronger language the Cabinet werereminder) that we had already made a. protest to theGerman Government, and it seems&apos;5 desirable to expressstrong views in Parliament on a matter in which publicopinion was deeply concerned&apos;,    also that, if this wasnot done it wrould facilita.te the adoption by theGermans of similar forcible action towards Czechoslova-kia.Tn favour of the milder langua-ge it was pointed outthat it. was important to avoid giving the impression that we were on the brink of war:    it was equally important to avoid exacerbating the situation or giving an impression o^ threats which we were not in a positionto carry out:    and that the general public would be muchmore concerned with what action the Government proposedto take to develop our own defences than in verbalcondemnation of Herr Hitler *In the  course of the discussion on this point thePrime Minister received a note from the parliament.menta.rySecretary to the Treasury, which he read to the Cabinet,and which stated that the Opposition Parties had. asked,for a Debate in the T-Touse of Commons the same afternoon,on the eroun^ that the House could not get on withordinary business until the subject of Austria hadbeen dis cussed *The Prime Minister pointed out. that this ratheraltered the situation,, as. instead of an announcement in both Houses without a Debate to follow, there would now be a discussion, in winding--up which the government spokesman could, if necessary, supplement the originalstatement by firmer language.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed,out that in any event the statement would, have to bemade in the House of Lords.
The Prime Minister suggested that the condemnationshould be applied, to the methods used, by Herr hitler and the shock that had been given to world confidenceby those methods. Tt was true that so far there ha.dnot been much bloodshed, but after what had happenedno-one anywhere would feel any confidence as to whatHerr Hitler woul^ do next.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed,with the Prime Minister that what it was necessary tocondemn was the method, and the shock to confidence.He would include a passage on those lines.   He also agreed with the Prime Minister in a dislike of threatsthat could not be carried out.   He thought, however,that if the Government wanted to get public opinionbehind them they must show that they were not afraid,to tell the Dictators what, they thought.   otherwise there was a danger that public opinion might reactstrongly against  continuing the Italian conversations.The Prime Minister agreed, provided that the condem-nation was  confined to method, and the shock to publicopinion and did not indicate that events were leadingus to war.   He thought, however, that in the House ofun-Commons a. formal statement was^necessary and that thewhole question had better be dealt, with in the form ofa. speech.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thefollowing formula:-&quot;The methods adopted to produce this result  call for the severest cond.era-nation and. have administered, a profound,shock to all who are interested, in thepreservation of European peace&quot;.The Prime Minister sa.id that he would accept this .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referredto a note he had received during the Meeting fromSir Robert Vans it tart, and Sir Alexander Cadogan,
9 P P0 0 bcontaining, inter alia, a suggestion that a reference should be made to the rumours that had been put about that the Germans had acted with the approval of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments   He thought thai this rumourmight be referred to in the passage in the statementdealing with condemnation of the German methods and.the shock to public opinion.The Cabinet agreed  Thai the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have authority to draft   a    statement for use in either House of Parliament in such manner as might prove most  convenience-ent (eeg..,, as a read statement or asthe basis of a speech) .-7-
THE SITUATIONIN central europe.FurtherDefenceMeasures,(previous reference:Cabinet 12(38).)3.   Tn conformity with the Conclusion referred toin the margin, the Cabinet had before them the follow -ing documents on the Possibility of Further DefenceMeasuresA Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air (CP.-65 (38)) describing thepresent position and suggesting that theAir Ministry should be authorised now toadopt Scheme K (reproduced as Appendix IVto C.P.-24 (38)) as their expansion pro-gramme, estimate^ to cost  567 millions?that sufficient labour of the right kind should, be made available to enable all important factories working on the AirMinistry programme to work double shifts,where possible, this to be applied, throughthe whole ranee of armament, instruments and. equipment c    On a broad estimate, thisarrangement might give an increase in aggregate output of something like one-third,  commencing at the end of threemonths.    The Secretary of State alsodesired authority to establish civilianrepair shops run by the aircraft firmsthemselves instead of by Service personnel in Service depots, and. to expand and increase training establishments to take as many recruits as could be coped with.In conclusion he emphasised, the vitalimportance of the anti-aircraft gun andsearchlieht programme keeping step as faras possible with the acceleration of ourde-fences in the air:A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forWar &apos;CoP.-66 &apos;38)) attaching a statement showing the present position in regard, toanti-a.aircraft artillery and. searchlightequipment in this  country and. the possibleposition in three months&apos;  time  (a) without taking special measures:(b) giving special priority to A.A.equip-ment, and.(c) with acceleration on an emergency basis.Our present equipment amounted to some 2503&quot; 20 cwt. gun equipments, together with3,000 rounds of ammunition per gun, whichwas regarded as an adequate scale for Homedefence.    The Secretary of State also attached a note showing the position regarding foreign purchases in so far as these affected AUA0 production in the nearfuture.    The only advantage to be obtainedfrom foreign sources in the immediatefuture was in connection with 40 mvm.A.A.equipments and. ammunition, of which typesome 50 additional equipments could, be purchased through the agency of BoforsCompany if approval were given at an earlydate.
The Prime Minister read a letter dated the13th March, 1938, from the First Lord of the Admiralty (stillabsent indisposed) in which he gave reasons for claiming that an increase in Naval Construction would be preferable to increased Air Construction in present circumstances.(Appendix)The Prime Minister said that he himself feltthat the argument submitted by the First Lord of theAdmiralty did not outweigh those in favour of AirConstruction and Anti-aircraft Defence, which had appealed to the Cabinet at the last meeting.     Unless any of hiscolleagues took a contrary view, therefore,  the discussion would proceed on the basis of the proposals submitted inthe memoranda referred to above.The Home Secretary said he would have liked bothincreased Naval and Air Construction and he recalled thathe had supported the Admiralty proposal for laying down a third capital shipcThe Secretary of State for Air said that his plan would provide by March, 1939, a first-line bomber strengthof 1320 and a fighter strength of 544 aeroplanes with atotal metropolitan first-line strength of 2182 machines.Behind this, it was true there would only be scanty reserves&quot;but, under his plan, we should get full reservesapproximately by March, 1940, that is to say one year earlier than as now contemplatedo     These results could only beachieved if, both as regards the manufacture of aircraft and the various ancillaries, sufficient personnel was provided for double shifts and priority was given in certainraw materials, particularly special steels and alloys.
It would be difficult without detailed examination toexpress an opinion as to the amount of labour required.As, however, there was at present a slight recessionin industry, he v/ould have hoped that something mightbe achieved by an approach to the employers and employedin general industry.The Minister of Labour insisted that it was first necessary to know the numbers that were required and where they would be wanted.     If anything in thenature of compulsion was thought possible, it must be recalled that that could not be   used   for    thepurposes of obtaining a relatively small number of workers and it would raise a most dangerous issue in its most dangerous form.     In the course of the discussion, heread the following extract from a memorandum he had circulated just two years ago (CP^ 96 (36) dated the26th March, 1936):-&quot;In conclusion it must be emphasised that labour is as essential for carrying out thedefence programme as men are for the fighting forces.     It has been indicated that there may be serious difficulties to be overcome in the supplyand the necessary distribution of skilled labourduring the forthcoming years,      These diffficulties,though grave, will not be insurmountable ifcareful regard is had in the planning of theprogramme to the labour that can reasonably beexpected to be available.     This means that anattempt to produce all the requirements at agreater speed than the labour supply will make possible will defeat Its own ends.     What is needed, from this point of view, is so to plan thewhole programme that there may be a steady and inthe later stages a swift acceleration of production.If industry is given enough time it should be ableto adapt itself to the new demands withoutseriously interfering with its normal output on civilian work.     Within a year&apos;s time much can bedone by industry- itself in the reorganisation oflabour supply, which would greatly reduce labour difficulties and appreciably increase theeffectives available for the programme.     If, onthe other hand, speed at all costs is attempted,
very serious labour questions will be thrown up atonce, with all the embarrassing consequences notonly for the armament programme but for civilianindustry..      In short, therefore, there is nothing in the picture from the labour point of view whichwould make it impossible to carry out the programmeover a reasonable period and at a progressive rateof acceleration with complete success.     If,however,  the period is too severely limited, orthe rate of acceleration at the start too rapid,the dangers of failure are very real.&quot;That extract represented the situation fromthe labour point of view very much as it was to-day.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat this was a very grave matter from many points of view.     He recalled the following passage inparagraph 27 of the recent Statement Relating to defence (Cmd. 5682):-&quot;Further stages of expansion will take the formof increasing progressively the strength of theRoyal Air Force both by forming additionalsquadrons and by increasing the establishments of individual squadrons.&quot;That passage should be the starting point if further expansion was decided on and this course would avoid any public impression of the increase being apanic decision and would convey an    idea   ofcontinuity of policy.     His own firm view was thatif the Cabinet were to adopt substantially Scheme &quot;K&quot;,it meant an end to the plan of fixing a total sum for defence Expenditure.     By no conceivable means would it then be possible to adhere to the Cabinet1s decisionof the 16th February, namely -&quot;That the figure of  lc650 millions should betaken as the maximum sum which can be regardedas available for all defence purposes over thefive years 1937-41.&quot;    (Cabinet 5 (38) conclusion (a)(i).)
There was a fundamental difference in ourposition from that of other nations.     If we became involved in war, we could adopt unorthodox measures suchas excessive borrowing, inflation of currency and sofortho     At the present moment, however, we were in &apos;heposition of a runner in a race who wanted to reserve hisspurt for the right time but did not know where thefinishing tape was.      The danger was that we might knockour finances to pieces prematurely,,       ^unl-ess the Cabinet were to adopt Scheme &quot;K&quot; as our goal,they would be deciding on something which was below what was regarded by the Air Staff as the minimuminsurance.     Unless the foundations of Scheme &quot;K&quot; were laid down now, it would be impossible to implement withina reasonable period of time any fresh decision that mightbe taken 18 months hence.     He reminded the Cabinet alsothat Air armaments unlike Naval armaments could be cancelled.     He urged, therefore, that he should be given authority to take such steps as were necessary to makeScheme &quot;K&quot; possible.confirmed the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer thatthe adoption of Scheme &quot;K&quot; would wreck the armamentprogrammes recently adopted by the Cabinet.     This was shown by certain sketch figures which he had sent out to departments as a basis for discussion in the allocation of the available funds.     The adoption of Scheme &quot;K&quot;would mean the allocation of su much of the availablemoney to the Air Force as to reduce the quota available tothe Navy and Army very seriously.     For three shifts, aThe Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatThe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence
considerable recruitment of labour would be necessaryover and beyond what could be obtained from the ordinaryinducements provided by such factors as the prospect of several years continuous work.     He had consulted sir alexander Ramsay, who had said that if any large influx of men was required, it would be necessary to approach the Trade Unions with a view to dilution.      Suchapproaches were likely to be badly received.     sir alexander had recalled that 93,000 men had already beenbrought into the armament industry.     Unless the need was very urgent, he had thought it would be better toproceed along the present lineso     He was satisfied that what the Secretary of State for Air required to be donequickly would not be practicable without dilution oflabour, which meant the exercise of strong persuasion -perhaps with compulsion in the background.     The sort of difficulty he anticipated from the Trade Unions was thatthey would make conditionsi e.g. they might demand thatthe Government should undertake to use the arms in supportof Czecho-Slovakia or insist on the question being dealtwith by the League of Nations.      Before entering on such discussions, the Cabinet ought to make up their mind asto whether they were ready in case of a rebuff or ofimpossible conditions being insisted on to impose some form of compulsion, which would be very valuable alsoin connection with Air Raid Precautions.The Secretary of State for India recalled theCabinet decision on 16th February that the Governmentcould not afford more than  1570 millions for the defence services.     He understood that if they were now to adoptScheme &quot;K&quot;, it meant an increase of  60 millions.     Thatfroultf. have a grave reaction not only on our financial position.. &quot; -but on our whole economic system. There would be
a heavy demand for skilled labour which would be increasedby the proposal to transfer the repair work of the AirForce to private manufacturers,,     To him it did notappear that this was justified by any change in circumstances that had occurred since the date of theCabinet decision.     The principal new factor was theincreased risk that the Germans might march into Czecho-Slovakia,.     We were not committed to intervention in that event, but he agreed that we might be drawn in.     Germany,however, would have to reflect that she would have tomeet not only the Czecho-Slova1: s who, it was known,intended to resist, but also the French, the russians and perhaps ourselves.      It was unlikely that the germans would be -sfiwilling to run this risk.     The Air forces that might be up against them might be very considerable.In these circumstances, he was opposed on financial andeconomic grounds to an extension of expenditure.The Prime Minister said he had been ponderingover the question during the weekend and he had cometo the conclusion that the Cabinet ought not to adoptScheme &quot;K&quot; without further examination.       The implications of the proposal ought to be examined more thoroughly.It was clear that        skilled labour was the bottle-neck.He suggested that no particular programme should bedecided on but that investigation should be set on footat once and conversations should be entered into withthe Trade Unions and the aircraft industry in order   toascertain whether extra skilled labour could be obtained by voluntary agreement and to what extent.     That mightbe taken as -the factor to determine the pro grannie.     He had hoped to avoid a Debate that afternoon, in which casenothing need have been said on the subject, but as there
was to be a Debate, he thought it might be desirable,after dwelling on the shock of recent events, to saythat they had the following effects:-(1)    To undermine confidence, and(2)    To increase the efforts of thevarious nations to make further provision for their safety in anunsafe world.It might then be recalled that it had always been saidthat we intended to review our Programmes and that wehad decided on a fresh review now, the result of whichwould be announced in due course.The Lord Chancellor suggested that the PrimeMinister should also announce that the Governmentwere getting into touch with the Trade Unions and theaircraft manufacturers.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterurged that it was as important for the Cabinet toconsider the views of the &quot;Right&quot; as well as of the&quot;Left&quot; in parliament to     He himself had had exceptionalopportunities for knowing Mr. Winston Churchill&apos;s viewsSince joining the Cabinet and having access to cabinet documents, he was deeply concerned at our inability to fulfil the pledges of the late Prime Minister,     Hecould see the reason for the difficulties, but theGovernment were going to be faced with a strong demand.Even the News Chronicle urged that we should press on with rearmament.     If the Government were to announce that the matter sas &quot;under consideration&quot;, they wouldbe told that that was what they always replied and thatthe circumstances needed action.
The Secretary of State for War agreed with thePrime Minister that it would be inappropriate to adoptany particular Scheme without further enquiry.    It wasnecessary, however, to face the fact that the Cabinet&apos;present decisions contemplated a re-armament programmespread over five years.    It would be said that it had beenembarked upon in order to meet a situation which was rapidly becoming imminent.    He recalled that the Chancellorof the Exchequer had spoken of what we could do financiallyif engaged in a war.    As a matter of fact,  we were at this moment entering on war.    The new method of war was for one country to fall on the other in the night.    Herr Hitleralways told people in advance what he was going to do.In this connection he read the following quotations fromHerr Hitler&apos;s book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;:-&quot;A Germary stretching from the mouth ofthe Ems to that of the Danube, from Memel toTrieste, from Metz to the Bug, is in aposition to impose peace in Europe ...Because the whole world wants peace, thewhole world must want this Germany.&quot;&quot;If the Germans alone understand the truthsof political morality, it is better for theworld that Germany, that is to say, the truth,should prevail.    In Herr Hitler&apos;s words,&quot;every question of foreign policycan be considered only from the standpoint:will this or will it not be to theadvantage of our people?     All con-siderations of internal politics,  of religion,  of humanity,  every other pointof view -.. must be eliminated.&quot;He recalled that the Secretary of State for india had spoken of the possibility of allies.    He was not so sure
if any would be lefts    Germany now had only one flank to depend-. It was only necessary to glance at the mapto see that the Czecho-Slovak flank could be turned at any moment.    The Germans could walk in at any time to acountryside where their compatriots had already rebelled.Spain was likely to add an additional frontier forPrance to defend.    He asked the Cabinet to realise that within half an hour three hundred German aeroplanes had arrived in Austria bringing with them the equivalent ofthree pre-war battalions of infantry with full equipment.We were up against new methods and a man who had gone along way in the development of German armament.-    Therewould be grave risk if our only reply to Germany&apos;s realeffort was a dilatory expansion.    Prance was our onlycertain ally?  and Prance had only a most inadequateAir Force.    Our own air defence was terribly behind-hand^The Cabinet had been examining this question over months?but examination did not produce war material-    Only six3.7-inch anti-aircraft guns had yet been delivered.    Inthe field force also there     were     great deficiencies,for example, the field guns were of a type adopted in 1905.He hoped the Cabinet were not under any illusions as to theextent of our ability to defend ourselves from the air.We had hoped that the Germans would have been preparedto talk and our Ambassador in Berlin had encouraged us tothink so.    Sir Nevile Henderson had proved wrong just as mr Palairet had proved right.    He felt that the cabinet ought to examine the Defence Programmes not from the pointof view of paper figures, but of production.    He agreedthat the Trade Union leaders ought to be seen, and thatan effort ought to be made to obtain enough men to work
***    ryshifts.    At present v/e were trying to carry through our programme without any interference with trade against a power that was concentrating every effort on armaments.We ought, therefore, to consider a great intensification of our efforto    It was all very well to have a five years&apos;Programme, &quot;but we should not have five years for it.It was clear that Germany meant business.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the events of the last few days had not changed hisown opinion as to the German attitude towards this country.He did not think it could be claimed that a new situation had arisen.The Prime Minister pointed out th.?t it was now12.30 p.m.    He was due to lunch with His Majesty the Kingat 1 o&apos;clock; he had a number of questions on ForeignAffairs to answer in the House of Commons and he had tomake a statement which he had not yet had any opportunityto compose.    This discussion confirmed him in the opinionhe had already expressed that the Cabinet were not in aposition to make any specific statement that day,  andthat nothing could be said beyond announcing a fresh review in the light of recent events.    If, however,  the Cabinethadbeenable to take decisions in time,  it would have beenpossibleto make an announcement on the morrow.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To adjourn the discussion.(b) That the Minister for Co-ordination of defence should further investigate the proposals ofRRj&amp;^i)!    the Secretary of State for Air and theSecretary of State for War in consultation both with those Ministers and the Minister of Labour^
(c) That the Prime Minister in his speech inthe House of Commons should recall thepassage in paragraph 27 of the statement relating to Defence, (Cmd.  5682) that&quot;further stages of expansion will takethe form of increasing progressively thestrength of the Royal Air Force . . . .11and should state that a fresh review wasbeing undertaken in the light of recent events.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.,14th March,  1938.
APPENDIX.ADMIRALTY,  S.W.I.13th March, 1938.Copy of Letter from the First Lord of theAdmiralty to the Prime Minister.My dear Prime Minister,I am sorry to say that as a result of getting upyesterday I have had a slight relapse and have been sent backto bed,  so that I shall not be at the Cabinet to-morrow.I have heard from one of our colleagues that increasedAir Construction rather than increased Naval Construction willbe under consideration.      In this connection I would suggest(1) that nothing we can do in the air is going to alarm Germanywho is steadily increasing her lead in that element,  (2) thatthe war won&apos;t be won in the air and that if we have to fightGermany again, blockade must be our principal weapon,  (3) can we be confident if we give large oraers for new machines thatthey will be delivered - or that,  if they are, we shall beable to train the pilots in time to man them?On the other hand, increased Naval Constructionon the lines I have suggested can be accomplished by a strokeof the pen - all preliminary preparations for it having beenmade already.      So long as we retain naval superiority, wecannot be defeated in war, but the margin of our superiorityover Germany and Japan is very narrow and will diminish.Increased Air Construction now may be interpreted as a yieldingto internal criticism, whereas increased Naval Constructioncould only be taken as a direct reply to the aggressive policies of Germany or Japan.
Of course, any increase in our Naval Forcesjustifies Germany in increasing hers - but she has not yetbuilt up to Treaty limits and any increases will further taxher limited resources.Yours ever,(Signed) DUFF COOPER.
