1r;9   jThe Cabinet met as a matter of urgency for theconsideration of an issue that had arisen as the resultof conversations that had taken place on the previous day between the Prime Minister, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and Count Grandi.   At the end ofthose conversations it had been arranged that the PrimeMinister and. the Foreign Secretary should meet theItalian Ambassador again on Monday, 21st February.The main question under consideration was as to whetherthe Italian Ambassador should be informed, that HisMajesty&apos;a Government were willing at once to take upconversations with the Italian Government in Rome witha view to an appeasement between the two countries,or, alternatively, whether a further postponement ofthe formal conversations in Rome (as distinct from theless formal talks  in London) should be asked for.Tn this matter the main issue was not one of principle,as to the desirability of an agreement with Italy, but rather of method, timing and whether the present moment-was opportune or not.     A subsidiary issue was as towhether any, and, if so, what conditions should be imposed before entering on the conversations.After the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs had explained the issues to theCabinet, a. discussion took place in which every memberof the Cabinet was asked his view.The decision was postponed until the following day,Sunday, 20th February, at 3.0 p0m.NOTE:    By instructions of the Prime minister a full summary of the discussion hasbeen prepared and is on record on theSecretary&apos;s standard file of cabinet conclusions .all Gardens, S.W.T,February, 1938.

1.    The Prime Minister regretted the inconvenienceto which he had put his colleagues by summoning a Meetingon Saturday afternoon, but an issue had arisen suddenlyof great importance.   He and the Foreign Secretary feltthat there was no alternative but to put the positionto their colleagues.   The moment had now arrived whenit was necessary to inform the Italian government whether we were prepared to enter into conversations.He then gave a resume&quot; of the history of the question.mhe Cabinet was aware that when he took office as prime Minister he had formed the opinion that it was desirable to make an earnest effort to improve relationswith Germany and Italy.   He had seen that we were drift-ing into a position that might soon become dangerous.Our relations with Germany, so far from improving, weregetting more embittered, and our relations with italy were very bad. as the result of the Abyssinian affair.At that time no-one realised that our difficulties wouldalso be carried, as far as Tokyo, though there was somesimilarity between the ideas of Japan and the EuropeanDictator States.   He had begun by referring to the matter in a short speech that, he had made in the House ofCommons oh the LEIPZIG incident.   A little later he had referred to our willingness to receive a visit from aGerman Minister, for there had been a question of Baronvon Neurath coming here.    This had arous ed no comment inGermany, but no actual response was made, and- eventuallywe had. learned that Baron von Neurath could not  come atthat time.   Any advance vis-a-vis Germany, therefore,was blocked.As regards Italy he recalled that in July he had had. a conversation with Count Grandi, whom, he had consulted as to the advisability of his (viz., the PrimeMinister) sending a letter to Signor Mussolini. . The
Italian Ambassador had jumped at the proposal and theletter had been sent.   Th.ere had. been an instantaneousresponse in Italy, and the letter had ayaonce produced a better feeling towards this country.    The situationfurther improved when he wrote to &quot;Lord. Perth proposingconversations in September.   His reasons for theseactions had been, first, his realisation of the perilsto which our military unpreparedness exposed us, and,second, because, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, hehad been oppressed by his realisation 6f the growingburden of armaments.     1,B00 millions was a tremendoussum, but even then he had felt that we should not beable to hold to it without some alleviation in thesituation, for he felt certain that we had not got. tothe bottom of our defence requirements and. that these would increase.   His apprehensions had been fulfilled,and only at the last Meeting of the Cabinet the figure had been raised, to  1,550 millions.   Even after thatthere was the prospect of the Cabinet being faced, twoyears hence with a momentous decision which, if itresulted, in further expenditure, would, involve thecountry in the gravest financial dislocation.     As theHome Secretary had said the other day, some othercountries did. not take expenditure into account.We had not yet seen the final result of that, whichmust be serious.   The restrictions which had alreadybeen caused had become an appreciable burden, and eventually must be a source of weakness,    Our own creditposition was an immense strength to the country and initself was a strong deterrent to war unless an aggressorfelt that he could knock us out in the early stages ofa war.    Consequently we could not get. away from thatposi+ion unless we contemplated so^e arrangement which-2-
would include a reduction or limitation of armamentswithin a. reasonable time.   He had felt, therefore,grave apprehensions not only owing to the growingrisks of war but also on the score of financial stringency, and h-&apos;\tv irht :&apos;t necessary to considerwhether he could make a last effort to alleviate thesituation,    either by some concessions to Germany or some lightening of the position vis-a-vis Italy.His own feeling with regard, to Italy was that thatcountry resembled a hysterical woman.    Italy feltthat we had. thwarted her in her assault on Abyssiniaand deeply resented, it.    JVhen the exchange of lettersof July had not been followed up in September theItalian Government had behaved, in a hysterical mannerin her desire to vindicate her position.   There had also arisen in the mind of Signor Mussolini a suspicion that the postponement of the conversations was not really for the reasons given, but was part of aMachiavellian plan to gain time until our armamentswere completed and. we should be in a position to exactconcessions.     He (the Prime Minister) might bemistaken, but that was his view of the Italian attitude,and it was supported by a. good deal of information.The real obstacle to the conversations, however, hadbeen the action of Signor Mussolini himself.   He(the Prime Minister) ha.d always assumed that recognitionmust be preceded by some action by the League ofNations.    Signor Mussolini had. rendered, it impossibleto obtain that action at Geneva by his bombasticstatements to General Franco and an outbreak of submarine-ine piracy.     Signor Mussolini, however, suspected thatthe delay was due to dark and sinister designs on our part.    Before Christmas the Foreign Secretary and
himself had had a conversation on the subject.   they realised that the question of conversations had reached a deadlock, and v/N-.t made matters so much the worse was that a good many nations were becoming restiveat their inability to put their diplomatic relationswith Italy on a proper footing owing to the difficultyof recognition.    They had agreed, that they shouldexplore the possibilities of escaping from the impasseAt first all went well.    The Foreign Secretary&apos;ssoundings at Geneva a-n^ with the French Governmentshowed that there were no difficulties in those direc-tions, and the American Government, who at one time had seemed hostile, agreed that recognition would bejustified, as part of a. general appeasement.   Moreover,the Italians had become rather more amenable.   when we found ourselves  compelled to give drastic instruc-tions to our warships as to how they should deal withsubmarines, the Italians, somewhat to our surprise,volunteered to do the same in their area.   Materiallythis did not mean much, but as a gesture it was highlysignificant.   He himself felt no doubt that this was due to their belief that there was some prospect of conversations.   Again, in telegram No. 69, dated february 16th, the Earl of Perth had reported that count Ciano, at the end. of a conversation,&quot;added, that although no grea.t progress had. yet been ma.de about the start of conversations he felt something wasstirring, and this in itself was afavourable sign&quot;.That was the situation when Herr Hitler delivered hisv    qoup.   Although the Austrian Chancellor was trying tom.a.ke out that.- the position was not so bad and herr hitler was claiming his action as an example of hispeaceful efforts, we knew that Herr Hitler had treatedthe Austrian Chancellor in a most brutal manner,
-s-ummoning him to Berehtesgaden, confronting him withGenerals and, as it v/as rumoured, movements of troops and threats of the consequences of a refusal.    Whatwas the attitude of Italy?   Signor Mussolini had goneoff on a ski-lng excursion and the Austrian Chancellorcould not get an answer to his appeals.   He was informed that in fact Signor MuSaolini had tried onthe telephone to persuade Herr Hitler to adopt an attitude of moderation, hut without success.    In theend, therefore, he had advised the Austrian chancellor to make the best terms he could.    This seemed to thePrime Minister, in the circumstances,to he a seriouschange in the situation.    Once more an urgent decisionhad been obtained by force.    Europe had receivedanother lesson as to the methods by which germany would pursue her aims.    Tt was difficult to believethat this effort was the last, or that the eventualresult would not be the absorption of Austria andprobably some action in Czecho-Slovakia.    That produced a dangerous situation.   He did not know what would bethe reaction in the 3alkans.    Tt mieht lead, thoseStates to give up all hope of resistance to thehegemony of Germany.    Tt would, seem that this must beunpa.latable to Signor Mussolini and. that an opportunityoffered to encourage him to make a. more determineds t and.With the agreement of the Foreign Secretary he had asked. Count Grandi to come and see him on the previous day.   The Ambassador had come.At this point the Prime Minister handed round, a record, of the conversation madeby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (Appendix).The Prime Minister,  continuing, sa.i* that theForeign Secretary had received some information to theeffect that Sicnor Mussolini was believed, to have
entered into an agreement with Germany.    The PrimeMinister had then told Count Grandi that he wanted, tobe absolutely frank, that many people were saying thatthere wa.s some agreement between Germany and. Italyover Austria, and had asked him as to the position.Brnhe Ambassador assured, the Prime minister that, there was none&quot;.He gathered that the Foreign Secretary was notprepared to accept this as the whole truth.    It mightbe that Count Brandi was not fully informed.   he himself felt, however, that if there was an agreement it was difficult to see why Signor Mussolini should, beso anxious for conversations with us.   He had thengone on to ask Count Grand, i about a rather mysteriouspassage in a. recent telegram, from the Earl of Perthstating that Count Ciano&quot;had just written a long letter to signor Grandi instructing him to urgeearnestly ori you that an e*rly startshould be made with A.nglo-Italianconversations in view of the possibilityof certain future happenings&quot;.He had also consulted, him about a message he himself had received, through Lady Chamberlain, where count ciano had. insisted on the importance of time. LadyChamberlain&apos;s  comment being that the Ita.lian ForeignMinister wes changed and worried.    Count Grandi&apos;sinterpretad-ion was that Signor Mussolini did. not know where he stood or whether he was to regard the United.Kingdom as a potential enemy:    consequently&apos;he couldnot take a firm line with&apos;Herr Hitler.   Until he was satisfied on the point he had. no alternative but tocontinue in agreement with T-Titler, which would eventually make agreement with us impossible.&quot;he Prime Minister continued that he and theForeign Secretary had then gone on to discuss with the ambassador what subjects ought to be covered in the
conversations and where they could be held.    CountGrandi insisted that the conversations &quot;should includeeverything and we could both raise any subject thatwe desired&quot;,  as Signor Mussolini wanted a complete agreement and a restoration of our former cordial relations .On the question of where the conversations shouldbe held he himself had suggested that progress might bemade in the first instance in London, and that at thefinal stage Count Ciano might be brought in to concludethem by a. visitc    Count Grandi had explained that these were very deli.ca.te matters,    &quot;he original intention hadbeen that the conversations should take place in Rome,and if we now insisted on a change in this respect hisGovernment might think there was some catch.    On thewhole, therefore,  the Prime Minister had felt that wecould, not press for London as the venue and that weshould, have to agree on Rome, bringing the Earl of Perthback to London first for instructions ,Next they had. discussed the Spanish problem, andCount. Grandi had maintained that it would be a mistake to hold up progre.ss/in the Anglo-Italian conversations on a. question in which others were involved besidesthetwo nations.   He had added that he did not think thatthe Spanish problem, need prevent, agreement.At this point they had adjourned until 3 p.m.On reassembling, the Prime Minister had askedCount Grand! whether the Italian Government would, be ina position to accept our proposals in respect of thewithdrawal, of volunteers if conversations were reopenedat once,    &quot;he Ambassador ha.d. explained that the formulawas a difficult one for the Italian Government to accept.-7-
He had added that perhaps he had been over-optimisticin what he had. said on the subject. Eventually CountGrandi had undertaken to consult his Government further on the question. As Signer Mussolini was reported tohave summoned his Cabinet, an answer might perhaps be forthcoming very soon. That concluded the history ofthe question.The Prime Minister than said that it remained for him to tell the Cabinet that in the matter of the actionnow to be taken he and the Foreign Secretary did not quite agree.   He proposed first to give his  colleagueshis view, and then for the Foreign Secretary to statehis attitude.The Prime Minister&apos;s. view was that the present occasion provided one of the opportunities that came atrare intervals and did not recur.    It was an opportunityto show Signor Mussolini that he might have otfceer friendsbesides Herr Hitler.   He himself deeply regretted thatit had been impossible to do this earlier.   mhe resultof our inability to act had. been extremely unfortunate,for it had pushed Signor Mussolini and Herr Hitlertogether and had resulted in the Anti-Communist Pact.It had. led. also to the despatch of reinforcements from italy to Worth Africa, which was embarrassing to us andwas likely to continue unless some agreement was reached.The result of successful conversations would be to givecourage to Italy, to Austria, and to the small States ofEurope, and to reassure many people who apprehended,that Hitler&apos;s move in Austria would be followed up by.other.action to the detriment of the democratic countries.He himself believed that Count Grandi had been tellingthe truth.   He knew that Italians were often unreliableand unstable, but he had watched, the Ambassador carefully
and at very close quarters and had felt satisfied asto his veracity.   He believe^ that it was not too late to avert a most, dangerous situation-    In support ofthis he quoted a telegram from the Earl of Perthreporting a  conversation with the Ministers of SovietRussia and Czeeho-Slovakia to the effect that thesituation in Central Europe would not recover untilthe United. Kingdom and. Italy came to terms.French Attache&quot; had. expressed, similar views.   Hethought there was no difference of opinion betweenthe Foreign Secretary and. himself on the desirabilityin principle of conversations with a view to an agree-ment with Italy,   &quot;he issue was as to the method,He a.sked his colleagues to consider the fact that count Grandi had said, that Signor Mussolini wanted the conversations and that we had. long decided tha.t theywould suit our need, also *    Tf we rejected, the presentapproach it would, be taken as a final rebuff and as aconfirmation of the suspicions the Italians had longharboured that we were postponing them until we were strong enough to impose our own conditions,    In that event the relations betxveen the two countries would be seriously embittered.   We shoul&apos;5 find the Italiansgiving trouble in Spain&quot;,    there woul&apos; be more rein-forcements sent to North Africa&apos;,    propaganda against us would be accentuated?    and there would be a. repercussionon our conversations with Germany as the Italians wouldimpress upon them that we were altogether unreliableand were &quot;leading them up the garden path&quot; with theintention of backing out at the end.   He was convincedthat, this was an opportunity that might never occuragain, and not to embrace it would be not only unwisebut  criminal0
In reply to a question, the Prime Minister said-that his idea was that the conversations should, cover the whole field, that on Monday, when Count Grandi was coming back to receive his final answer, we should saythat we were prepared, to proceed with the sonver sat ionsin Rome and. were instructing the Earl of Perth toinform the Italian Government.   --Ve then proposed to recall the Earl of Perth to receive his preciseinstructions.   His idea was at the same time to informthe French Government and to instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Germany to inform the German Governmentthat the conversations were not directed in any wayagainst the Berlin-Rome &quot;axis&quot; but to bring about ageneral appeasement.    If a decision could be taken that afternoon he would try and get the information to herr Hitler before the latter made his speech on the morrow.   He would also like to authorise Sir nevile henderson to carry out his instructions to open upthe question of conversations with the German Govern-ment early next weekBThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, beforebeginning his statement, explained that the accounthe had prepared, of the conversation between the PrimeMinister and himself and Count Grandi (Appendix),although put in the form of a draft Despatch to the^arl of Perth, was not intended to go without modifica-tion.   Paragraph 10, for example, would, not bein eluded.(At this point the Cabinet adjourned for b few minutes to enable members to read, the document in the Appendix.)
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs expressed deep regret at his share of the responsibilityfor this raeeting.     In the circumstances, however, he had felt it unavoidable0     The difference between the PrimeMinister and himself had been in regard to methodSo     he agreed that much depended on our appreciation of signor mussolini&apos;s motives- .   It was quite possible to take theview that the Italians had been terrified by the Germanaction in Austria and were anxious to come over into ouroamp,   at    the same time closing the Abyssinian chapterand returning to their attitude prior to that episode.    Ifwe were sure of this it would be worth while to take the risks of conversations which, in his view, were very realrisks.     He, however, could not take the view of a changein Signor Mussolini&apos;s attitude without further proofsIt was sometimes said that the Foreign Office had nevergiven the Italians a fair chance.     That was not true.It was they who had recommended the raising of sanctionswhich was a particularly difficult decision for himself.The main object rightly or wrongly had been to improveAnglo-Italian relations.     The only result had been tomake Italy more attractive to Germany and to cement the rome-Berlin AxiSo     He himself had supported the Gentlemen&apos;Agreement with the same object of improving relations.The Italians began to send troops to Spain almost at thesame moment*     This had been a breach not of the letter but of the spirit of the agreement     The Submarine Agreenentof November, 1936, had shared the same fate.     He saw no evidence of s change of heart at the present time.,     On thecontrary, the incorrect and tendencious communique issued from the Italian &quot;Embassy shortly after the conversations
of the previous day (reported only in the Daily Telegraph,and there only in part) seemed to indicate the contrary.That communique had gone to America, where it might doharm.     As to Italy&apos;s silence over Austria, he couldsuggest an equally probable explanation to that givenby the Prime Minister.     In fact, he himself was aliiiostconvinced that the real explanation was that the ItalianGovernment had done some deal with the German government under which they had given Hitler a free hand in austria and retained in return some quid pro quo of another kindin the Mediterranean.     If that were the case, the PrimeMinister has asked why Signor Mussolini had wished to open conversations with us.     He believed the reason wasthat Mussolini wanted some prestige to counter the harmdone to his prestige by Austrian eventsc     To openconversations now in Rome would give him that prestige.The Italian Ambassador&apos;s explanation was only one moreexample of Italian methods of political blackmail.To open formal conversations at short notice would be amost unusual procedure.     Count Grandi had wanted LordPerth to inform Count Ciano that we were willing to open the conversations in Rome now.    Ho doubt this would be announced by the Italian Government as the opening of the conversations, after which there would be no hurry.The usual procedure was to prepare the ground and settledetails first.      If this were not done, Signor Mussolini mightollow the matter to go on until the main question at issue,namely, that of Spain, was settled, and put on us the onusof breaking off.     Prom every point of view, it was a badmoment for the conversations.     Europe would treat it as though we were running after Rome.     Berlin would regard it
as proof of the value of Italian friendship,  and itwould he anticipating President Roosevelt&apos;sstatement next week, so he did not agree to theconversationse      If Signor Mussolini was sodesperately anxious to change camps, it would be easy for him to give proofs of goodlaith and goodwill.     He had shown none.     He would not even havenegotiations in London nor would he agree to theformula for the withdrawal of troops in Spain.Even if they did agree to this, there would be noreason why we should get on any faster with theSpanish question as a whole.     It had been suggestedthat the announcement of official negotiations would produce an immediate detente in Europe.     he believed the opposite was the case.     It would heknown that the conversations would have to includede jure recognition and it would be regarded as another surrender to the Dictators.     The only result would be a panic among our friends and a rushto make a composition with Italy and Germany.     ThereThere would be an impression of scuttle in Englandand alienation of public opinion in the United States.What was the alternative?     Two things had to beconsideredo    First, what our own attitude should beand, second, what we should say to the ItalianGovernmento     On the first point, it was his conviction that it would be a mistake to announce the opening of conversations in Rome at the presenttime.     First, we ought to obtain an indication of italian good faith and good will.     Such an indication uould be found in Spain if the ItalianGovernment **ould modify their attitude there and agree
10 9a. to the formula that we had proposed for the withdrawalof volunteers.      If they would then co-operate to thepoint that the withdrawal had actually begun, the momentwould then be appropriate to open conversations.      Itwould be even more appropriate if in the intervalItalian anti-British propaganda had died down.Coming to what he would do when Count Grandireturned on Monday, he would like to say that Friday&apos;sconversations had been fully considered;    that in ourview the time was not yet ripe for a formal opening of conversations in Romes    on the other hand, that we diddesire to improve Anglo-Italian relations, but that wecould not expect to make much progress until somepreparatory work had been done especially ially in connectionwith Spain.     In the meanwhile, we would be very readyto continue informal conversations in London such as had recently been taking place, in order to prepare for thepublic opening in Rome.      In fact, he would insist on theordinary procedure to prepare for the formal opening.He recognised that the Cabinet might take a different view,but he himself did not feel justified in taking the grave risk which he believed to be involved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had beenvery glad to hear the Foreign Secretary begin by defining the difference as cno bp to methods.      In other words, as-to timing,,     This was very important.     There was nodispute that the Government wanted conversations withSignor Mussolini.      The question was one of when and how.That was the nature of the difference.     He could not see how it could be argued that we did not want conversations.That had been the case ever since the Prime Minister&apos;sdemarche last July and rje had made our attitude public.Only three weeks ago, the Foreign Secretary had made plain
to the French Government that we were not contemplatingrecognition of Italy&apos;s position in Abyssinia in isolation.     But we had given a whole list of questionswhich we hoped to get settledo     In this connection heread the following extract from a telegram from theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs describing along and very satisfactory conversation withM. Chautemps and M. Delbos at the Quai d&apos;Orsay (GenevaTelegram Ho, 2 of the 26th January):- OnOn one point we were quite clear.     we considered that we could only grant de jjurerecognition as part of a generalappeasement which would include such questions as the Libya garrison, propaganda,Spain, the Red Sea and possibly somedemilitarisation in the Mediterranean itself.Such an agreement, if concluded,  could fairly be represented to the League ofNations as a contribution to peace and as justifying action on its part to free its members to grant recognition.     The french ministers appeared entirely to share these views,Our general attitude, therefore, was quite clear but he agreed that the question of time was important.     The Foreign Secretary had asked whySignor Mussolini wanted conversations now.     He himselfdid not dispute that recent events might well havemade Signor Mussolini more eager.     He recalled, however,that the Duce had long wanted these conversations.It was impossible to argue, therefore,  that signor mussolini wanted the conversations solely in order toobtain a sudden advantage that would enable him to recover credit after the loss of prestige due toevents in Austria.     The truth was that the ItalianGovernment had shown itself anxious for the conversationsfor six months past.     They had said so again and again,Signor Mussolini had wanted the conversations long before the Austrian trouble, though he might want them more now,
The Chancellor continuing said that the foreign secretary, who had special sources of information notavailable to the Cabinet, asked himself whether thepresent proposal was not a trap.      He himself did not see how we could go on saying that we were anxious to haveconversations, but always refuse to get to grips.    Hewould not feel that this was right even is he were moreconfident than he was of the prospects of success - andhe was not particularly confident of this.    He did not propose that we should recognise the Italian position in abyssinia unless we got what we required in return, e.g. ,in regard to Spain.    Were we so sure that we could not get agreement that we were right in refusing conversations?The Government would be open to very serious rebuke ifthe history of the last six months was reviewed, and itwas realised that when this invitation reached them, theyhad done nothingc    He agreed that the announcement madeon the previous evening by the Italian Embassy had beenbad, but that was only characteristic of Italian methods.1that did not Justify us in declining conversations that,we had talked about for six months.    He agreed that events in Austria might have added to Signor MussoliniTs desire for the conversations, but that rather added than other-wise to the importance of this approach.    Was it anexaggeration to say now that Italy must make a choice?There was one other consideration that had not yet been mentioned.    He was not referring to the financial factor?important as it was, but to the feeling that existed allover the country,  that we could only watch the Austriansituation nnd were powerless to do anything.    He felt
that all the more strongly because at Stresa he had saidthat the integrity of Austria vas a British interest.    Itwas true that he had never promised that we wouldintervene, but everywhere in Europe people were realisingthat we were impotent..    There would be a great advantageat the present time in any positive step.    It would havea useful effect in the House of Commons if we could showthat we were seizing the appropriate opportunity offered by Italy   which might produce a result. If theItalian intentions should,  in fact, be genuine, it wouldbe a grave error to have refused it.    There would then beno doubt as to which side Italy would 30 in Europe.    Itwas not sound, therefore,to say that while we favouredconversations, we thought the present moment inopportune.To take a positive step at the present time would put us in the position of playing the part of a great Power,but to say &quot;not yesterday, not to-day, not to-morrow,but perhaps some day&quot; would have the opposite effect.He thought, therefore, that the issue was one of time,and that the appropriate time was now.The Lord President of the Council said he wouldhave preferred to hear the opinions of more of hiscolleagues since as yet his views were rather inchoate.When the Foreign Secretary had been speaking, he had felt the force of the argument that it would not be atall unreasonable to tell Count Grandi that we were quite keen on pursuing the conversations, but that thepresent moment was not a very good one, and that ifthe Italians disliked this, we should insist on theirshowing some evidence of good faith.    On that point,
however, he felt that the Cabinet must form their judgment on the effect produced on the Prime Minister andForeign Secretary of the results that that kind of line was likely to have with Count Grandi.    After what had happened during the last few months,  and the numerouspostponements, he could imagine that such a course might produce an adverse effect on the Italian Governmentdisproportionate to our intentions   Having said that, hecould not quite understand why the Foreign Secretarycontemplated conversations at all, He could quite imaginehis saying that the subjects were so difficult andunpalatable that we could not face discussions, but thatwas not the position.    He could see that recent eventsmight make some people disposed to oppose conversations with Germany - though he hvjped the Government would notadopt that view - but he himself was glad of anopportunity to redress the deplorable impression produced in Austria by &quot;Gangster&quot; methods-    He was apprehensivelest we should postpone too long and lose our opportunity.In August he himself had been acting for t he foreign secretary who was away.    At that time he had supposed that conversations with Italy were to begin in a month.    Nowsix months had elapsed without any conversations.    during these months things had happened and conditions did not get any easier.    His own disposition was not to delay.He was doubtful also as to whether we should insist onevidence of.-Xtalian good-will.    It might be that this didnot exist, and he would be very watchful and evensuspicious, but because agreement had not been reached
over Spain or over propaganda, he did not thinlc that thatwas a reason for saying we would not talk about these things.    He felt much the same in regard to conversations with Germany.    He drew attention to recent telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin, who made it quite clear that this might be our only chance of reaching agreement.    We ought to act as though we hoped to achieve the best, but be prepared for the worst.    Delay wouldnot help us at all.    If it v/as true that, as the foreign secretary had suggested, Signor Mussolini had in hispocket a post-dated cheque from Germany, delay would not help.    He would keep the suggestion in mind, however,and try to produce a situation in v/hich the cheque would never be presented.The Lord Chancellor said he was prepared to aoproach the question from the point of viewthat it might be true that the Italians \yere not to be relied on.    They had betrayed the Triple Alliance at theoutbreak of war.    That was ah argument not againstimmediate conversations, but against conversations at all.The Government had, however, already decided onconversationso    The question, therefore, was solely oneof time.    If we rejected conversations now, negotiations might not be any easier thereafter.    This was the acceptedtime for Italy, so we ought to concur.    Even ifMussolini&apos;s motive was one of getting prestige, that should not really make any difference for us.    If we wereto turn his proposals down now, it would be an inducement to Italy to launch into some adventure and call on germany to honour her undertaking, whatever it might be.
If we were to hold conversations now, the Italiansmight decide not to go forward, with their supposedadventure or to call on Germans for support.      He couldnot see what we had to lose by going forward with the conversations.    Whether they took place to-morrow or amonth hence, we were equally exposed to the risk of italian bad faith.    Finally, he added that he did not see how we could expect the Italians at this stage togive up the important card they held over the volunteersin Spain,The Home Secretary said that his views were sowell known that he was almost reluctant to speak.   Therewere two considerations that impressed him; first, thata study, not only of the last six months, but of the last twelve years, showed that we had always been too late;the second, that the alternative to conversations nowwas no conversations - we should get no second chance.The real alternative indeed was one even more grim thanthe prospect that had been held out by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence at the last meeting of theCabinet. In addition, Europe would be dividedinto two camps.    That would involve us in approachingour defensive position in a totally different manner,which would affect the whole national life.    We shouldhave to prepare here and now for a war emergency.    Thatwas what every successive Chief of Staff reportedpractically at every meeting of the Committee of
Imperial Defence.    Consequently, we ought to decide infavour of immediate conversations, but we should keep oureyes open and make clear to the country that we are notyielding to the Dictators.    The risk of any other course was so great, that there was really no alternative.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence agreed with t hose who had spoken before.     The suggestion hadbeen made th^.t Signor liussolini had a bargain with herr hitler.      It had also been said that he did not likewhat had happened in Austria.     If so he should be in abetter mood.     After the Prime Minister&apos;s letter of lastAugust, if no conversations took place, Signor Jussoliniwould say that this was a final determination on our part not to proceedo Mussolini was subjected to troublesin Abyssinia and to economic difficulties.      If we refusedto converse with him the effect might well be for him to start making his plunge with a view to rushing into actionbefore   his situation became desperate.     In fact a refusalv/as almost calculated to provoke an attack.     He himself wasnot much impressed lay the prestige argument.     Only the strong and self-reliant could afford to ignore prestige.      Ifwe went ahead with the conversations that would be thenatural sequence of events.      If we did not people would say &quot;The Cabinet has changed its mind&quot;.     The only objectionv/as that people might say that the decision was due to what had happened in Austria.     That did not appeal to him as muchof a reason for desisting.     He thought we should pursue the conversations.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked what was thenature of the post-dated cheque which Mussolini was supposed to have received from Hitler.   He himself believed that italy had all the time been apprehensive of eventual attack by ms, and that if there were a post-dated   cheque it probablyconsisted in a promise by Germany to support him against that eventuality.     As it would never arise, there wasnot much risk.     It ought to be remembered that after the
Hyon Conference Italy had withdrawn her submarines fromthe Western Mediterranean, The only post-Hyon attack had been by a submarine with non-Italian personnel,.     &apos;.&apos;.eappreciated the danger of a hostile Italy in theMediterranean, but even if we spent double what we nowproposed, we could not provide adequately to meet it.     Hewas impressed by what the Foreign Secretary had said,and more particular by his instinct, based, of course,on immersion in foreign affairs, that the time for-conversations was inappropriate, but he gathered thathis colleague agreed to conversations later.     If the choice lay between now and a month hence, he might agree.He himself thought, however, that the moment was now*The Dominions Secretary was anxious, like hiscolleagues, that the conversations should be pursued andfollowed up, if only in order to make some progress in reducing the number of enemies with which the Chiefs ofStaff were so gravely concerned.     All agreed on that,but it was a matter of timing.     He gathered that thePrime Minister proposed to make an announcement on Monday,The Prime Minister said that the proposed announce-ment would only be to Count Grandi, and not to the world.The Dominions Secretary said that if the announcementwere made to the Ambassador, it would be difficult toavoid announcing it publicly.     This was illustrated bythe Italian Embassy&apos;s announcement on the previous day.He thought the Foreign Secretary would have to say somethirin the House of Commons,    In normal circumstances carefulXDroparation was necessary before a conference..     Today,perhaps, circumstances wero abnormal,, and there might be, a
the Prime Minister had said, an opportunity that vo couldnot miss, hut even so we ought to make sure that therewas a reasonable chance of making headway, or at least of our not being made to look foolish later, before wecommitted ourselves.     He gathered that the foreign secretary appreciated that there existed some German-Italian bargain.      Signor Mussolini&apos;-s attitude certainlywas rather strange.      It might,  of course, be that hehad weakened Italy by his Abyssinian and Spanishadventures, but the other explanation that there hadbeen a bargain was an equally plausible one.     So beforeannouncing the conversations he would like to be clearthat Signor hussolini would not thereafter send further reinforcements to Spain, or issue encouraging messages to General Franco, as he had done before.     He thoughtour prestige would suffer from an immediate acceptanceof conversations, and the Government would be asked ifthey had received any assurances.     Consequently we oughtto obtain that kind of assurance about Spain.     Hewould, therefore, support the Foreign Secretary to thepoint of insisting on some such assurance, and he wouldalso try for the acceptance of our formula over thewithdrawal of volunteers in Spain.     We should bein a stronger position if we could get that.     He didnot think that if Signor Mussolini really wanted con-versations he could object to that.    Consequently his proposal was that we sho.i\ld not say to Count Grandi&quot;We will enter into conversations&quot;.     He would, say thatwe wanted the conversations^ but that we wanted certainassurances first, and We might quite possibly get them.
So, although he wanted conversations, he would not heprecipitate in acceptance.     He agreed with the HoneSecretary that the Government would encounter political criticism at home.     He was impressed with what   theChancellor of the Exchequer had said to the effect thatafter events in Austria public opinion might be inclined to receive the announcement with relief.      It had to beremembered, however, that there were different currentsof public opinion, and that a large number of peopledetested Italy,     At one time lir. Churchill had been amongthoseo     Caution, therefore, was necessary.The &quot;Minister of Labour pointed out that in spite of hitler&apos;s action in Austria, nothing had been done bythe Stresa Powers.     If there were any chance of securingSignor fiussolini&apos;s return to his original position we ought not to lose the chance.     The time for conversationswas no we the Secretary of State for India realised that thiswas a difficult decision for the Cabinet.     He appreciated the suggestions of the Dominions Secretary about Spain,The attitude of Count Grandi had been unsatisfactoryin so much as he had receded from his previous optimism.It almost looked as though between the morning and after-noon meetings of the previous day, he must have consultedhis Government.     There was another consideration ofgravity that had not been mentioned.     What would be theeffect of a sudden approach to Signor Mussolini,surrounded by a lot of publicity, on Hitler himself?What would be the effect on our relations with Germany?Neither Mussolini nor Hitler was a comfortable bedfellow,but he himself was conscious of the importance of the
improvement of our relations with one or another.     Hethought the prospects with Germany were better than with italy, so he hesitated to take any step that might retardan improvement in our relations with Germany.     On thewhole an improvement of relations with Geraany would bea better bargain than with Italy.     He had not a greatopinion of the Italians as people with whom to go tigerhunting.      That was a consideration he could :iot get out of his mind.      The Germans were rather a stupidpeople in political questions, but they could hardlyoverlook that Anglo-Italian conversations at this momentmight weaken the Rome-Berlin Axis.      -Thatever assuranceswe gave they would assume that our fundamental object wasto detach Italy.     He would like to know the foreign secretary&apos;s view on that point.     His own view v/as that itwould be better to postpone the conversations ofr a time.If Signor Mussolini reaLly wanted thern to covtinue, why should he object?The Minister of Health said he appreciated the pointof view of the Foreign Secretary and Dominions Secretary,but he thought they had failed to realise the immediatedangers of the situation.     In his view it would be askingtoo much to expect Signor Mussolini to give up one of hisstrong cards (over Spain) before the conversations began.If the results of the conversations were satisfactory inregard to Spain, everyone would be satisfied.(The Foreign Secretary indicated dissent).He thought therefore^ that we should seize the presentopportunity.     If on Monday Count Grandi was informed thatwe were not willing to continue, that would be an endof the prospect of conversations.     If we accepted, many people would get relief by reducing the number of our
enemies.     After the recent report by the Minister forGo-ordination of Defence we certainly ought to try and reduce the number of our enemies,      There were risksin every course, but he thought we should try to cometo terms with Italy.The Secretary of St. to for War understoodtho Foreign Secretary&apos;a reluctance to embark onthe conversations in view of previous experience,but if, as was not disputed,, v/c i/rust have con-vcrsations some time, why not now?     The PrimeMinister had said that this was o:\q of the decisive moments in history.       If that view was accepted, the only answer was &quot;Now&quot;,     Events un austria had left the world breathless,       e werelosing the confidence of all the South European States.Events in Austria had shown them that they could notreljr on France and ourselves to act.     lie had heard thesuggestion that some deal had been made between hitler and Mussolini,      .&quot;e could clarify that by means of conversations, because Italy could not reach agreementwith us if she had done a deal.     He asked himselfa question as to who would be pleased if we refused the conversations.     Not the South European States.     German-alone would be pleased.     The Secretary of State forIndia had said that he would not  care   to go tigerhunting with the Italians, but the Germans were tigerhunting now.     If Germany were to gain the belief thatshe had an open field, and that we could do nothing, theresults would be. incalculable.      It was time that signor mussolini might gain some kudos from immediate con-versations, but many people would dorivc   encouragement.

It was true that signor mussolini might gain some kudos from immediate con-versations, but many people would derive   encouragement.
If we neglected the present opportunity, we might saygoodbye to all negotiations.     Count G-randi had been summoned to meet the Prime Hinister and the foreign secretary.     He had informed Signor Mussolini.     to answer that we had found some new reason for postponement would be almost to invite an aggression..The President of the Board of Education said hehad tried to put himself into the shoes of ItalyeSignor Mussolini had lost prestige.      If he could not get the conversations now, he would put the blame onus.     We might be able to get more from him today than we could by postponements     As to Spain, he did not agree with the Dominions Secretary^     He recalled thatthe Germans had wanted to get out of Spain some time ago? but had been unable to extricate their troops.      Sig-nor Mussolini probably had the same idea today, and ifhe were granted the conversations, he would use themfor   that purpose.     Otherwise, he would not withdraw his troops.     Up to now our attitude had been somewhatnegative.      If Signor Mussolini could not see a change,he would regard it as one of hostility.     He did notthink that  many people would say that we were runningafter Italy in consequence of what had happened un austria, although they might sa3&apos; that our object was toavoid the colonial issue.     i:e thought that the conversations should take place now and not later.
o a 7The President of the Board of Trade said it wasimpossible for an ordinary member of the Cabinet to decide what was the intention of Italy.,      The very fact that theForeign Secretary and the Prime Minister disagreed made itthe more difficult.     If the Prime Minister was right in hisestimate of the position, the effect of a refusal of conversations would be disastrous,.     There was no middleposition between conversations now and later.     After allthat had happened, an anti-climax of that kind would be tantamount to a refusal.      If Signor Mussolini was sincere,that refusal would be a disaster.   - If that was the case,what we stood to lose by conversations was nothing comparedwith what we were certain to lose by refusal.     He agreedthat immediate conversations would involve political difficulties here but that would be equally true at any othertime.     Moreover, events in Austria should tend to reducethat opposition.     As to the prestige argument, if that were a right one, it was an argument against reaching an agreement at any time.      If Signor Mussolini was going to cash a post-dated cheque in a few weeks, he would not want thistemporary prestige0     As to the suggestion that we shoulddemand proofs of Mussolini&apos;s goodwill, he thought that thatwas too much to ask.     The Americans were in the habit ofdemanding agreement to all their desiderata before thenegotiations took place.     That, however, was peculiar tothat nation.     Signor Mussolini could not be expected to give up his position over the withdrawal of troops from Spainbeforehand.     Withdrawal would, in any event, be a blow to his prestige which he could only cover by an agreementwith us.     He would distinguish, however, between demandinga withdrawal of troops and that he should not send re-inform*eementso     When entering on a negotiation, we were
entitled to say that each side was at liberty to alter thesituation to meet their own requirements.The Minister of Transport supported the PrimeMinister&apos;s view both as to the course to be taken and themethod.     Nothing would damage  Signor Mussolini&apos;s prestigeso much as the admission that Brescia and other northItalian towns must be friends with Austria.     Memories therewere too long.     When the Rhineland occupation took place,the Germans had been surprised that nothing had happened,,This time they.would accept some move.     He himself had long experience in negotiations with Italians0      It was important to concentrate on the essentials and leave themto make play with the non-essentials.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat the difficulties of the issue before the Cabinet wereproved by the fact that the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary differed,.      There would certainly be criticism of a decision in favour of conversations and, in this respect,he shared the view of the Secretary of State for IndiacHe thought, however that the prestige argument did not govery far.     Would Turkey and other countries, for example,think that we had gone into these conversations under theinspiration of fear?     He thought not.     There had been talk of a deal between Hitler and Mussolini, but Hitler had felt able to take action against Austria because Mussolini hadbeen weakened by his adventures in Spain and Abyssinia.     Whenhe reviewed everything that had happened, he reluctantlycame down in favour of going ahead with the conversations.He though^, however, that we ought to obtain some assuranceon the lines suggested by the Dominions Secretary and thePresident of the Board of Trade, for example, that nothing should be done by one nation to the detriment of the other.
He thought, however, that we should go further than this.During the negotiations, we might find ourselves in aposition of being blackmailed to give up something essentiallest we should have the responsibility of breaking offnegotiations.     The situation would then be worse than itwas now.      It was rather difficult to find suitableassurances, but he would try and obtain them in regard to spain.     If we could not get them, he would still be infavour of going on with the conversations.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thathis position approached that of the Secretary of State forIndia and he had rather hoped that we should have startedconversations first with Germany.     Two events had happened,however.     First the episode at Berchtesg a den and thenCount Grandi&apos;s visit to Downing Street.     After this, itwould be a mistake to postpone conversations or to bargainabout the conditions of negotiations.      If we did not go ahead our last chance would be lost.     Of the two, he himself preferred Hitler to Mussolini, Germany to Italy,tout, in view of recent events, he thought it right that weshould go forward and start conversations with the Italiansas soon as possible.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that until he saw exactly what our objective was in the conversations,he saw the utmost danger in going ahead.     If we did not intend to stand firm on a point like Spain, there would be great danger both in our own counsels and in Parliament.He would be apprehensive lest Signor Mussolini at some point might say &quot;Close now or I break off negoai&amp;tions&quot;.     Thereason we were contemplating these negotiations was at bottomdue to fear.     Small nations could see this as well as wecould.      It was as likely to be interpreted as action due to
fear as to courage0     The bloc   of powers in the middle east, Ibn Saud, Iraq, etc, would say that England toowas yielding to the Dictatorso     In effect, we should beentering on conversations which we had undertaken ctobring to a successful conclusion.      (A good deal ofdissent was expressed to the latter observation.)The Secretary of State for Air said everyoneagreed we had contemplated conversations with Italy.    Other-wise he doubted if the Cabinet would have been content withthe figures for expenditure on armaments       large as thosefigures were.      The decision that had been taken, however,rendered it impossible for us to reinforce Egyptadequately except by exposing our home front to danger.He realised that the conversations would be difficult,but there was a change of a reasonable agreement.     Heshared the general mistrust of the Italians but thatstruck at the argument not of time but of havingconversations at all.     It was said that a Dictator couldswing public opinion as he wished, but it would be muchharder for Mussolini to swing Italian opinion against this country after an agreemimt,     We could not ask italy to give up her principal cards before the conversations.There were times when Governments ought to take a lead and this was such a time.     If it were true that thecountry would be ir, jeopardy, if we could not bringoff a success,  then vie ought to make the attempt.Generally speaking, the feeling of the country was strongly in favour of peace and this argument would, hethought, beat down every other consideration.     He didnot believe that conversations with Italy would destroy the prospects with Germany.The Prime Minister said that everyone had nowexpressed their view and there was no doubt as to thegeneral opinion.     The circumstances were exceptional
and it would not &quot;be possible to have a long delay on a priornegotiation before the proper negotiations openedo     That didnot mean that v/e shovjd obtain no assuranceso     He recalled that at the end of the conversations c.*i the previous * day?Count Grandi had promised to consult his Government on thequestion of the formula for the withdrawal of troops from spain.      If, on Monday, he could give a satisfactory answerso ranch the better, but if he could not, he felt that weshould not refuse the conversations in Rome.     There was,however, a second suggestion, namely, of stipulating thatno reinforcements should be sent to Spain.     The difficultyhe saw there was that the Italians might say that their action must depend on the action of others.     That dilemma was certain to arise.The Foreign Secretary expressed his thanks to hiscolleagues.     He realised that his own point of view jteadnot carried conviction and hoped that this was due to the merits of his case and not to his presentation,.     Everyonerecognised that there were risks in the course now proposed.He felt that a good deal might be lost by undertaking the conversations.     As to how the world   viewed   them: - wecould not ajinounoe that Austria would come into the field of the powvejcsations and people would say that we werenegotiating about Spain and Abyssinia,The Prime Minister added &quot;and the various questions in the Mediterranean and propaganda&quot;.The Foreign Secretary continuing said that,following so clo-sely on events in Austria, it would bo r^oiithat we were going top^ano^wiaji     That was the meaning ofwhat Mussolini had *sej  to the Earl of Perth and Lady
Chamberlain,,     Consequently our prestige would be lowered.It would not be the same if we were to make rapid progress with the Spanish problem,,     He agreed that we could not  expecta satisfactory assurance on Spain before the conversations butthat shov/ed the difficulty of getting an answer at all.He felt it conceivable that if Signor Mussolini really wanted the conversationr. he might give an assurance after all.    Wewere only asking Signor Mussolini to put us in a position tomake progress on a point on which Italy alone was holding usup and where everyone else would give their assent.     To give their assent was not a surrender on his parts     It might be true that Mussolini wanted to get out of Spain but, on theother hand, he might have wanted to make a deal with Gei-manyeListening to Count Grandi had made him realise how difficultthe Italians were to deal with.     All he suggested, therefore,was that some progress should be made with Spain before apublic answer was given.       He said that he had received anote from the French Government on the Austrian situationwhich ought to be considered almost at once6     He thought itwould be necessary to announce our policy in regard to Austriavery shortly.Turning to the question of Italian conversations,he said he felt bound to say that he coulu not recommend tothe House of Commons and argue in favour of a course inwhich he did not agree.     If his colleagues decided against his view, he hoped they would find someone else to help   them tocarry through this decision.In reply to a request for an explanation, he said he could not recommend to the House of Commons a course inwhich he did not believe.
The Prime Minister said that that was a distressingsituation.     The more so, because he himself held the opposite view so strongly that he could not accept any otherdecision.       In the circumstances, he thought that the right course would be to adjourn until the following evening.In the course of a short discussion which followedemphasis was laid on the fact that the Cabinet were dealingnot with a question of principle but with a question ofmethod and timing.     A resignation should only take placeon a question of principle.     Examples were given   frompersonal experience cf a yielding to the views of themajority of the Cabinet on questions that did not involveprinciple, however important that might be.A suggestion was made that in order to meet thedifficulties of the Foreign Secretary, Count Grandi should beasked to agree to include in the announcement a statement that a decision on Spain would be an important element inthe success of the conversations.At the end of the meeting, the Prime Minister saidthat the Foreign Secretary was well aware of the extent ofhis own regard and his recognition of the great service hehad renderedo     He deeply deplored the present difference of opinion.     The issue was a large one.     He knew that theForeign Secretary had h &apos;vd cm-anxious and worrying time.   To takea (iejni-SJLan hastily in those circumstances would be wrong&quot;He hoped, therefore, that the decision might be considered aspostponed until the following day.The Cabinet agreed;To adjourn until the following day at.0 pamtfWhitehall Gardens, S.W.I.19th February, 1938,
&apos; o 4 ft  1 &apos;1AFPEHIiIXDRAFrOF DggPATCH FROM THE SECRETLY OF stats for FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO H.M. AMBASSADOR AT ROMS.Foreign Office,18th February, 1938.My Lord,The Prime Minister asked Count Grandi to come and call at No. 10, Dov/ning Street to-day when a conversation tookplace on the European situation in general and Anglo-Italianconversations in particular.      The Prime Minister began by-remarking upon the anxious international situation with whichwe were faced.-     Austria was the most recent developrrent.    CountGrandi indicated that he regretted what had happened in thatcountry.      The Prime Minister continued that he wished to be absoulutely frank:    that many people were saying that there was some agreement between Germany and Italy in the matter.      the ambassador assured the Prime Minister that there was none.Italy had indeed, been expecting this to happen - it had notin that sense come as a surprise to them, but it was not theresult of an agreement.      Count Grandi thought it remarkablethat during the past three years since Stresa Signor mussolini had been able to-preserve the integrity of events in Austria,despite the divergence of views on other matters between thiscountry and France on the one hand and his country on the other.Now, when the event had occurred,  the?,re was nothing to. be doneowing to the state of relations between the Stresa Powers.2..    On the Prime Minister suggesting that all was not yetlost in Austria, Count Grandi said that possibly we were only atthe end ef the third act of four.    In $he..view of Italy, however,Earl of Perth,ROME.
Germany was now at the Brenner.     It was impossible for italy to be left alone in the world with two great potentialenemies - Germany and Great Britain.3.      Count Grandi gave a detailed account of Anglo-Italian relations since Stresa and emphasised particularlythat the post-sanctions period had been worse than the sanctions period itself;     Disappointments had furtherpoisoned the atmosphere.     After the Gentlemen1s Agreementof a year ago the hopes then maintained were not fulfilled.After the July exchange of letters between Signor Mussoliniand Mr. Chamberlain, there had been a happy fortnight whichhad again been marred by events in the Mediterranean.Now the Italian Government were asking themselves whether his Majesty&apos;s Government really meant to open conversations.4.     The Prime Minister then drew Count Grandi&apos;attention to a phrase used by Count Ciano and reported by your Excellency in your telegram No. 73, to the effect thatan early start should be made with Anglo-Italian conversationin view of the possibility of certain future happenings.The Prime Minister also mentioned that he had received a message from Lady Chamberlain repor ting a conversation inwhich Count Ciano had used very similar language to her.He had urged the earliest opening of conversations, adding&quot;things are happening in Europe which will make itimpossible tomorrow&quot;.     The Prime Minister asked CountGrandi whether he could throw any light on these phrases.Count Grandi replied that he had explained that Italycould not in present conditions visualise the possibility
of &quot;both Germany and Great Britain being hostile to her,     Ifit was impossible to improve relations with Great Britain,then it would be necessary for Italy to draw still closer to Germany,,     The decision would then be final.      It wasnot final yet, but there was very little time left.5.      In reply to further questions, Count Grandiexplained that in   the view of the Italian Government the conversations should include everything and we could bothraise any subject that we desired.^     He also explained thatthe Italian Government desired that the conversations shouldtake place in Rome because it had originally been theintention that they should take place in that capital, last september.     The Prime Minister explained that he did notthink any final decision in that sense had been taken and explained that in his mind he thought it would be possiblefor progress to be made between Count Grandi and myself inLondon and that at the final stage Count Ciano might havebeen brought in by a visit to London.     Count Grandiexplained that these were very delicate matters, but that hethought that Count Ciano would wish to be in the conversations from the beginning, as had originally been intended.     He therefore did not think it would be possiblefor conversations to be held with the best chance of successanywhere but in Rome.6.     Count Grandi was then asked what effect the openingof conversations might have on the Italian attitude towardsAustria.      Count Grandi replied that it was difficult for himto answer that except to say that it would give his people morecourage.    On being asked whether the Italian Government could now
exchange views with the other Stresa signatories on the subjectof Austria, the Ambassador made it clear that his Governmentwould not be able to do that - indeed, he said he had noinstructions at all to mention Austria.7.    The conversation then turned to the Soanish problem.Count Grandi was asked whether he was yet in a position to givethe reply of his Government on the subject of the formula forthe withdrawal of volunteers from Spain which had been proposedto him ten days ago.    The Ambassador replied that he was afraid that he had perhaps been a little optimistic in his conversa-tion v/ith rae about the formula proposed.    His Government had nowinstructed him to ask for certain clarifications.    Perhaps hecould explain these to me or Lord Plymouth in the near future.The Ambassador appeared to indicate,  however,  that if conversa-tions could be opened these difficulties would not be serious.8.    As to the Spanish question generally, Count Grandi main-tained that it would be a mistake to hold up progress in Anglo-Italian conversations on account of a question in which others were involved besides ourselves.    It would be hardly possibleto maintain that the development of Anglo-Italian relationsmust depend on other nations agreeing with us about the with-drawal of volunteers.9.    At the conclusion of the conversation,  the Prime minister asked Count Grandi to return at 3 o&apos;clock,  explaining thathe wished in the interval to have an opportunity to talk overthe situation with me.
10.    The Prime Minister then explained, to me that in his view the right course to nursue was now to tell Count Grandi whenhe came at 3 p.m. that we were willing to open conversations in rome and that Lord Perth would be seit for back to London in orderthat he might receive his instructions to enable him to representHis Majesty&apos;s Government in these conversations.    Since I feltunable to agree to that course, the Prime Minister   as good enoughto agree to call a Cabinet for Saturday afternoon.11.    When he called again at 3 p.m.  Count Grandi was there-fore informed by the Prime Minister that he proposed to consult his colleagues on the outcome of the conversations which hadtaken place between us and that he would see Count Grandi again on Monday to give him the considered view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.12.    Meanwhile the Prime Minister and I had agreed that itwould be desirable if we could at the second interview obtain some clarification of the Italian Government&apos;s attitude towards our proposed formula for the withdrawal of volunteers.    At thesecond interview the prime Minister therefore told Count Grandithat he had understood from the conversation of the morning thatthe Italian Government would be in a position to accept our proposals in resnect of the withdrawal of volunteers ifconversations were opened at once.    Count :&quot;i-randi explained thathe did not think that he had made himself quite clear.    Theformula I had orooosed to him was a very difficult one for theItalian Government to accept.    Indeed in its present form it
seemed to be a trap.    He had, as be had told us in the morning,been over-optimistic oerhaos in his conversation with me.Nonetheless the Italian Government wished to make progress andhe was wondering whether the best course would not be to leavethe question of what constituted a sub-.tantial withdrawal tobe settled by the commissions in Spain in conjunction with thetwo parties.    It would not be possible for the ItalianGovernment to accept a formula which would have the appearance of letting down General Franco.    It was explained to CountGrandi that the whole purpose of the formula was to avoidthat.    Since it was maintained by the partisans of each side in Spain that the number of volunteer; was larger on theiroononenfs side,  it was difficult to see how such an impressioncould be created.    Count Grandi eventually said that he would consult his Government further on this question.
