APPENDIX.Oopy of Letter from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to the Prime minister.Foreign Office, b.i&apos;/. 1,20th February, 1938.My dear Prime Minister,The events of the last few days have made plain a difference between us on a decision of great importance initself and far-reaching in its consequences.      1 cannot recommend to Parliament a policy with which I am not inagreement.Apart from this, I have become increasingly conscious,as I know you have also, of a difference of outlook between us in respect to the international problems of the day andalso as to the methods by which we should seek to resolvethem.      It cannot be in the country&apos;s interest that those whoare called upon to direct its affairs should work in anuneasy partnership, fully conscious of differences inoutlook yet hoping that they will not recur.      This applieswith a special force to the relationship between the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary.      It is for these reasons that with very deep regret I have decided that i must leave you and your colleagues with whom I have been associated during years of great difficulty and stress.May I end on a personal noteV     I can never forgetthe help and counsel that you have always so readily given tome, both before- and since you became Prime Minister.      Ourdifferences, whatever they may be, cannot efface that memorynor influence our friendship.Yours ever,ANTHONY EDEN.

Secretary&apos; s -Summary of the Proceedings at the Meeting ofthe Cabinet on Sunday, 20th February, at 10 p.m3 &quot;Cabinet 3(58)The Prime Minister regretted to state that when theForeign Secretary had met his colleagues he had reported thathe had given very careful consideration to the formula that had been proposed.      He regretted, however,  that he could not agree, and must resign.      Since then he had sent a letter of resignation, which the Prime Minister read to his colleagues.(See Appendix to the formal conclusions of the Cabinet)*The Secretary of State for India said he had profoundsympathy, both with the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary on the very distressing outcome of these discussions the result now appeared to be irrevocable.     lie asked if thePrime Minister was disposed to say what he wished hiscolleagues to do.The Prime Minister suggested that all should standtogether and face the situation.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that inthe small meeting of Ministers he had expressed the viewthat the resignation of the Foreign Secretary would be disastrous.      in these circumstances, though he had disagreedwith the policy of the Foreign Secretary, he had suggestedthat the Cabinet ought to go to all lengths necessary toavoid his resignation.     He still held that view as to the disastrous consequences of resignation to the Government andthe country.     He had, however, had an opportunity to think the matter over and he could see no benefit to the country from further differences.     Consequently he was prepared totake his part with his colleagues in facing the difficulties to come.(There were warm expressions of satisfaction at thePresident of the Board of Trade&apos;s attitude).
*0 ^ JThe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that in the discussions at the small group of Ministers hehad said that although he did not agree with the Presidentof the Board of Trade &apos;s view, nevertheless if other membersof the Cabinet resigned the number of resignations might become so great that his own position would be rendereddifficult.     lie felt, however,  that he need not say muchafter what the President of the Board of Trade had saidoIn thinking the matter over lie had reached the conclusionthat however many resignations there might be. he must stand by his leader, the Prime Minister,     Me concluded with a warm tribute of personal loyalty to the PrimeMinister.,The chancellor of the Exchequer&apos; said that the dominions secretary had spoken for all.The Prime Minister thanked his colleagues very warmly0He said that within the last hour or two he had spoken tothe Editor of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, who had given himan account of what at the moment the press understood ofthe differences, which had little relation to the facts0The Secretary of State for Scotland recalled that atthe previous meeting a formula for communication to theItalian Ambassador had been worked out, which seemedadmirably suited to the situation.     He asked whether thefurther conversations with Italy would be on that basis.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that theposition was now what it had been at the outset of Saturday1smeeting when all members of the Cabinet; except the lateForeign Secretary, had agreed that every effort must bemade to come to an arrangement with Italy, and had supported the proposals of the Prime Minister,     He hoped that we
should embark on conversations now.     The acceptance bythe Italian Government of the British formula on thewithdrawal of volunteers made it essential to continue at once.The Home Secretary said it was impossible to reachcomplete agreement until the League of nations had acceptedthe idea of recognition of Abyssinia.     By that time we shculdknow what was happening over the question of Spain.     liedid not think there was really any issue here.The Minister of Health thought that the formulaproposed by the Lord President of the Council was verysuitable to the present situation.The Home Secretary understood that the proposal tsqb tona?-:o the declaration to the Italian Ambassador but not toParliament.     He would like to try the formula on theItalian ^jnbassador, but not to insist on it as a condition.The Minister of Health thought the formula would be useful publicly.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreed.He did not think that the Cabinet could go back to theposition of Saturday morning.    The Lord President&apos;sformula was essential to the nev/ conditions.The Minister of Health agreed that the formulagreatly improved the case of the Government,The Home Secretary agreed, adding that the Govern-raenfs case was greatly strengthened by the Italianacceptance of the British formula on withdrawal of volunteers from Spain.The Lord President asked the Prime Minister to make such use as he thought of the formula that he hadpresented at the previous meeting.     He thought it could
be used with the Italian Ambassador without any danger.It served also to bring out how narrow had been the differences between the late Foreign Secretary and theCabinet.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries agreed.The issue v/as so narrow that the Cabinet ought to be ableto weather the storm.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that all had had a trying day.     He suggested that instead of tryingany further to formulate proposals for the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement, the best plan would be to ask the Prime Ministerto accept an expression of loyalty in the certainty thathe would make the case with his usual skill as well as itcould be made.(This proposal net with general approval).The Prime Minister thanked his colleagues for their view.     He saw no particular difficulty in presenting the case.     lie himself liud felt no uneasiness about theLord President&apos;s formula, because it only laid down beforehand and gave warning of certain elements that were essen-tial to an agreement.     While expressing gratitude to hiscolleagues he assured them that they might r-oly   on him touse the formula in the best possible manner, both in his conversations with Count Grandi and, subject to theresult of these, in his statement to Parliament in the afternoon.whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,20th February, 1938.
