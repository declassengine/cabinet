1.     The Prime Minister read to the Cabinetthe following message which he had received fromMr. Lyons, the prime Minister of the Commonwealthof Australia,through Mr. Bruce, the HighCommissioner:-&quot;The High Commissioner has advised mepersonally of his conversation with you in regard to rearmament.     I desire to confirm his statement that Australiav/ill be prepared to co-operate with theUnited Kingdom to maximum extent of herpower and financial resources in anyfurther defence preparation your government may decide is necessary for defence of Empire in face of seriousInternational situation.&quot;The Prime Minister added that the HighCommissioner was going to discuss the question withthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.Much satisfaction was expressed at theabove communication.
AUSTRIA.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssummarised the developments in the Austrian situationVienna first proposed a meeting between Herr hitler and the Austrian Chancellor^     The date suggested wasFebruary 9th, but the Chancellor refused to go at short notice, and the meeting eventually took placeon February 12th.     At that meeting Herr Hitler b:: oughtgreat pressure to bear on Dr. Schuschnigg, with theobject of accelerating the absorption of Austria byGermany, and also informed him that Lord Halifaxcompletely approved of Germany&apos;s action towardsAustria and Czechoslovakia,     The Chancellor appearsto have put up a good fight, but had had to make twoconcessions of great importance.     The first was that dr. von Seyss-Inquart he-&quot;, been nominated Minister ofthe Interior and Security;    and the second that dr. Schmidt, at present State Secretary for ForeignAffairs, had been appointed Minister for ForeignAffairs.       The importance of the first point was that dr. von Seyss-Inquart in his new appointment controlledthe Police, although the present Director of Security(as administrative head of the Police) remained in hisposition but was subordinate to and controlled by thenew Minister of the Interior^      The appointment of dr. Schmidt as Minister for Foreign Affairs might beof more importance that it appeared; since hiscomplete loyalty to Dr. Schuschnigg had in certain quarters been called in question, and we knew thatthe Chancellor was recently considering thepossibility of replacing him.     We also knew that theGermans were anxious to obtain the appointment ofPreviousReference:Cabinet 45 (37)Conclusion 5.)of the last few dayscOn February 7th the German Minister in
Dr. Schmidt as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and this in itself was highly suspicious.     The concessions which Dr. Schuschnigg had obtained in return (as reported in this morning&apos;s Press) did not appear to beof great importance and were probably more of aface-saving character.It was significant to note that Italy,although she was informed of this meeting, at any rate on the Austrian side, one day before it took place,i.e. February 11th - the same day that we ourselveswere informed, did not appear to have taken any actioneither in restraint of Herr Hitler or in support ofthe Austrian Chancellor.     The only conclusion that could be drawn was that another round in the fight forAustrian independence had just been fought and that thatround had gone to Germany.     We knew that during therecent episodes in Germany, Herr Hitler had resistedthe Nazi party who represented a forward policy un austria.     Eventually a compromise had been reached.It might now be that the price Herr Hitler had had topay for damping down those who demand quick and forcibleaction in Austria had been to accelerate the pace ofnon-forcible action.Referring to such action as we had had time totake in the short time available, the Foreign Secretaryrecalled that the British Minister at Vienna, when hefirst heard of the proposed meeting between the AustrianChancellor and Herr Hitler, had expressed doubts of itswisdom.     By the time we had heard of it, however, it was too late to take any action.     We had made the suggestionthat the Police should be separated from the Home office in Austria, but the suggestion had come too late.     The
Secretary of State himself had asked His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin to make enquiries as to what washappening and the Ambassador had been assured by theMinister for Foreign Affairs in Berlin that he had everyhope that the upshot of the negotiations would be oneof appeasement.      In order to bring the Cabinet up todate, he read Vienna    telegram Wo. 22 containing an account of a talk that the British Minister had had withthe Austrian Chancellor.The Lord President of the Council recalled thathis general impression as the result of his interview with Herr Hitler had been that the Fuhrer would continue his activities in regard to Austria, but in a manner which did not enable any other country to interfere.This appeared to be what was happening.The Prime Minister thought that Herr Hitlerwanted peace but at his own price.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he did not want any decision from the Cabinet atthe moment.     He would have to watch the situation very carefully and he woula keep in close contact with thePrime Minister1.     He did not want to put himself in aposition of suggesting a resistance which we could not,in fact, furnish.     The most interesting reaction to watch for was that of Italy.
.!    .1   ft^previous reference:Cabinet 4 (38)Conclusion 4,)3.     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had received a message from the italian ambassador, who was expecting a further communication from the Italian Government and had asked for anearly interview in order to deliver it.     The ambassador had indicated that he thought this communication was likely to be of a favourable character,.     If this proved to be the case, he proposed to press forward with the Spanish affair as rapidly as possible.     he added that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been asked by both sides to appoint an arbitrator on the questionof the exchange of prisoners and, subject to what theChancellor of the Exchequer might have to say,  thiswas a matter in which His Majesty&apos;s Government oughtto bear the cost.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed thatthis was the kind of expenditure that we ought to be willing to incur.      The request for our good offices in this matter was a high compliment to ourimpartiality and he thought it was very justifiable to incur the relatively small expenditure involvedin the appointment of a High Commissioner with a smallstaff.The Prime Minister agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer, and the Foreign Secretaryoffered his warmest thanks3Some discussion took place as to who shouldbe appointed.The Cabinet agreed:(a)   To approve the proposal of theForeign Secretary that the expensesof an arbitrator in Spain and his staff, in connection with theexchange of prisoners between thetwo parties in Spain, should beborne by His Majesty&apos;s Government:
That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should considerthe appointment of a suitableperson as arbitrator^
1 ri jITALY.Relations with,&apos; (previous reference:Cabinet 4 (38]Conclusion 5,4.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in reply to the Home Secretary,, stated that he proposed in the near future to circulate to theCabinet Committee on Foreign Affairs a Memorandum asto our desiderata in the proposed conversations with italy, together with suggestions as to the time-table.     He promised to bear in mind a suggestion bythe Prime Minister that instead of transferring the conversations to Rome, as Count Grandi had suggested,it would be desirable to work for the continuance ofthe conversations with the Italian Ambassador inLondon and for the Italian Minister for ForeignAffairs to come to London to conclude them.
I I p1J. b&quot;7KAVAL 5*     The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsLimitationidF ARMAMENTS,       reported that he had discussed the question of Naval-  -jfrapanese Limitation with the Japanese Ambassador and he thoughtI&apos; fiitude.that another effort ought to be made.     Apparently, speakingdevious foe himself,  the Ambassador had admitted this, but had reference:Cabinet 49 (37)   pointed out that the Jupanese Government had takenConclusion 1.)up a certain attitude and that it was difficult for&apos;      &apos; them to go back.     The Ambassador did not know what his Government&apos;s intentions were about naval construction, but seemed to think it might be possibleto find some other way than the official channel for communicating their intentions.The First Lord of the Admiralty said he had seen the annex^ican Captain Ingersoll, who had described an interview which he and the AmericanAdmiral Leahy had had with President Roosevelt.The latter htid approved the result of the discussionsheld in London.     The President had also suggested thatthe United Kingdom and the United States ought toreach agreement as to what was to be done in viewof the Japanese attitude before approaching theFrench Government on the subject.The Prime Minister suggested that it waswell worth while to explore the situation.     It looked to him as though the Japanese Government were anxious not to embark in a race for Naval armaments, butwanted to save their face.     The present position was rather a paradox as Japan refused to give information relating to qualitative disarmament because the other powers had not been willing to discuss quantitativedisarmament.
THE FAR EAST. 6.     Continuing his account of hisJapan and China,    conversation with the Japanese Ambassador, the2$ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs e-aid the(previous reference: Ambassador had made clear that his Government did notCabinet if- (38)Conclusion^&apos;.) desire mediation at the present time.     He (their.^(s^)5. Foreign Secretary) felt that if anything was to bedone in the direction of mediation, we should need the co-operation of the United States of America.In the meanwhile, at places like Shanghai where theJapanese were in occupation, the difficulties oftrade were increasing. s
1 I J7.     The Secretary of State for the colonies reported that the General Officer Commanding inPalestine had forwarded a request,  through the HighCommissioner, that the permission already given forthe employment of aircraft for dealing with the disturbances in Palestine should he extended toTransjordan .        His suggestion was that when the rebels crossed the Jordan, aircraft should be permitted to follow up their operations on the other side of that river instead of having to relinquishthem as at present.     He had consulted the ForeignOffice, the War Office and the Air Ministry on thesubject, and he gathered that the Foreign Secretaryfelt some doubts in view of a speech he had recently made on the subject of limitation on the use of bombingaircraft.     He himself was actuated mainly by thedesire to support the efforts of the Militaryauthorities to clear up the serious situation inPalestine unless wider considerations renderedparticular action undesirable.The Secretary of State for Air recalled that in 1936 during the rebellion careful instructions had been given as to the use of aircraft against armedbands.     Special care had been taken to avoid thedestruction of villages with the possible exceptionof the bombing    of    refractory villages after duewarning - a point on which he was not fully informed as the question had not been on the Agenda Paper.The present position was that the General Officer   Com-manding had authority to use his Air Forces in the same way as in the rebellion of 1936,     The question of whether he should be authorised to carry out the sameinstructions in Transjordan     appeared to him toy
depend on whether the result would be to keep TransJordanquiet or otherwise, a point on which he himself was notthe constitutional authority.    Subject to that, he thoughtit desirable that the General Officer Commanding shouldreceive the authority he desired.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he did not wish to veto the proposal, but he had felt itnecessary to mention that the action we took mi^ht be usedin Germany and elsewhere against us.The Secretary of State for the Colonies,  inreply to a question,  said that no announcement of the ex-tension would be made.    In reply to the Lord Presidentof the Council,  as to the Emir Abdullah&apos;s view, he saidthat the High Commissioner,  who was well acquainted with theEmirVs point of view, supported the request.The Prime Minister thought that the answerdepended on how the authority would be used.    vVas it theintention to pursue rebels mounted on camels or on horse-back or to destroy villages?The Secretary of State for Air said this would depend upon the precise nature of the existing instructions.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised to approve the authority asked for by the GeneralOfficer Commanding in Palestine to employAir Forces against Palestine rebelsretiring into Trans Jordan in the same manner as is allowed in Palestine.    TheSecretary of State was asked, however,first to satisfy himself as to thecharacter of those instructions andtheir suitability for   TransJordan.
8.    The Cabinet had before them a. Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs ( C .P.-28(?8)) on the Question of the Transfer to the Unionof the Government of the High Commission territories in South Africa, to which he attached for the informa-tion of his  colleagues copies of correspondence withGeneral Hertzoe and the draft of a Joint Statement.The Secretary of State sought approval.1 to the termsof the proposed Statement and to its publication soon after it had been agreed with the Union Cabinet..The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs gave the Cabinet a summary of his proposals.     At theconclusion of his statement he mentioned threeproposals by General Hertzog which had been rejected:first, propaganda in the United Kingdom;    second, thatwe should consult with the Government of the Union ofSouth Africa as to future appointments within theHigh Commission Territories;    and third,  that our officials should be used to exercise persuasion onthe natives to favour the transfer.     The onlydecision he asked for from the Cabinet was approval to the Joint Statement and for its early publication.In the course of the discussion, a numberof questions were asked relating to the Memoranda tobe prepared by the Union Government for theinformation of the native and European inhabitants ofthe Territories to give them a picture of the results which would follow a transfer of the Government of the territories to the Union,   For example, what was to be their aharacter?   Would they not contain a good deal of propaganda?    To what extent were we able to check their use for this purpose?     If so, what action should we take if those who were opposed to the transfer wishedto distribute counter-propaganda?     Would it not be
^ 9x Atbetter to get an agreed text for the Union Government&apos;sMemoranda before issuing the Joint Statement, even ifthis involved some considerable period of postponement?The Secretary of State for Dominion -affairsanswered all these points in turn.     He said that theSchedule to the South Africa Act gave the broad linesof the conditions of transfer.     Our own object   wasthat the Memoranda should provide as much information aspossible as to what would happen if transfer took place,as there was much misunderstanding on this point.     he agreed that it would probably not be practicable to eliminate every element of propaganda in the Memoranda.The first draft had been decidedly of a propagandistcharacter.     This, however, had   been withdrawn and hewas using every effort to eliminate &quot;Undesirable featuresin the drafts now under discussion.      If the Memorandathreatened to assume too controversial an aspect, wecould reserve our right to issue counter-statements.     Thiswould be very unpalatable to the Government of the Union ofSouth Africa and this gave us a lever for influencing theirattitude.     His idea was that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould be rooponoiblo for the distribution of theMemorand^/.     These would be distributed/by the ResidentCommissioners, to tho. na-ta^re-a- who would explain that theyhad been produced by the South African Government in orderto show what would happen in the event of transfer.     Theywould probably then allow the Chiefs to take them away forstudy.     An opportunity would -$ war be given to the Chiefsto put questions and these might be answered by arepresentative of the South African Government with the resident High Commissioner of the Territory affected Inthe Chair.
1 9 9X A&apos;As to the possibility of counter-propaganda,this could not be excluded, but we were pledged by the1935 Agreement to give our co-operation to the UnionGovernment so that our position towards them was different from what it was towards Missionary Societies or other bodies that wished to oppose transfer.     We were also   -bound by our undertakings in 1935 to discourage agitation against transfer to the Union.     The Secretary of state was averse to postponing the statement until the&apos;Memorandahad been agreed.     He had received information to theeffect that some members of the Union Government were reluctant to issue the Memoranda before the Elections, asthe advantages to the natives of the Territories inquestion when realised by farmers might have an adverse effect on the Government&apos;s prospects.      That v/ould involvepostponement until June.     From other points of view,however, it was desirable to publish the statement as soonas possible in order to show that the disagreement betweenthe two Governments had been allayed and that/co-operation was being scfatomptod-.     That was desirable from a parliamentary point of view in both countries.      He was alsoanxious to avoid giving the impression that we had any responsibility for the Memoranda.      That was not the case.Thef   were the responsibility of the South african government.     Our own interest in them was mainly to avoid any false statements, e.g. reflecting on our ownadministration and it was in such matters that it might benecessary for us to make a counter-statement in the last resort.     To publish the statement without any reference tothe proposed Memoranda would arouse much suspicion.      he offered, however, to consider his proposals again in thelight of the Cabinet discussion.cThe Prime Minister agreed to this.The Cabinet agreed:That the question should be carried over until their next regular weekly meeting.
DEFENCE EXPEND-        9.  The Cabinet had before there a Most SecretTTTJRE TN future years. further Report by the Minister for Co-ordination ofFurther Report   Defence ^C.P.-24 (38)) on the question of DefenceX$f the Minister.Expenditure in Future Years, in which he dealt with(Previous the revised forecasts of costs of programmes submittedReference:Cabinet. 49        hy the Defence Departments in accordance with the(37), Con-elusion 1.)       Conclusion mentioned in the marein and prepared on*ne basis indicated in his Interim Report (CP.-316r6(37)).    Tn his conclusions the Minister proposed thatthe figure of  1,650 millions should be taken as themaximum sum which could be regarded as available forall defence purposes over the five years 1937-41, ofwhich  1,570 millions should be prescribed as thelimit up to which the Defence Departments might workfor thai period, the question of allocation to be thesubject of discussion between the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Defence Ministers and himself, and ofa further Report to the Cabinet.   He also suggestedthat an Inquiry should be undertaken in 1939 in orderto consider whether, in the light of the international situation as it then existed, it was necessary and possible to authorise Defence Programmes of a widerscope and involving greater expenditure than the programmes which could he compassed, within the proposed.limit of  1,570 millions, but without precluding reviewof the authorised programmes at any time if changes inthe international situation rendered reductions possi-ble.   At the end of his conclusions the Minister statedthat the plain fact was that it was beyond the resouroesof this country to make proper provision in peace forthe defence of the Empire against three major powers in three different theatres of war.   He thereforedesired to repeat with fresh emphasis his opinion asto the importance of reducing the scale of our commit-ments and the number of our potential enemies.-1^-
1 9 A11- iThe Prime Minister paid a tribute to the efforts of the Minister for Go-ordination of Defence to resolve a very di^icult and  complicated problemthat had been referred to him, and invite^ him to open the discussion.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thathis task had proved even more difficult than he had anticipated, and he had not been able to refrain fromexpressinr some d is appointment at the result, of the fresh forecasts of expenditure.   He drew attention to paragraph 28 of his Memorandum, in which were ta.bula.ted.the revised forecasts.The Admiralty forecasts were made under two alternative hypotheses, namely, the D.R.C. Fleet andthe New Standard Fleet.   He drew the attention of theCabinet to the figures in this mabie.    Paragraphs 5to 8 of fhe Report explained the increase in theAdmiralty figures.    He gathered that paragraph 8 (ii)was criticised by the Admiralty.   He explained, however,that his o^n statement was an inference from theAd-niraity figures on page 17.    In any e^ent he thoughtit was accurate to say that the Admiralty were nowcontemplating a much larger expenditure on new construction in the remaining years of the quinquenniumthan was anticipated at the time when the Octoberforecast was  compiled.   He recalled that at theMeeting of the Cabinet on the 22nd &quot;December last(Cabinet 49 (37) Conclusion 1) the Chancellor of theExchequer had pointed, out that -.&quot;The effect of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence&apos;s scheme appearedto be that the Admiralty would continue for next yea.r on their present, basis and that in twelve months&apos;  time adecision would be taken as to whether their programme was to be increased&apos;-.
This remark was? base^ upon paragraph 57&apos; of his ownInterim Report (C.P.-316 (37)) -&quot;For the time heing, however, it is possiblefor the Admiralty to proceed broadly on thebasis of the D.R.C. Fleet without prejudice to the adoption at a. later date of theproposed new standard, should a decisionsuhsequently ^e given to this effect.This enables us to ^efer for the timeheing a decision on a matter which wouldhave such far-reaching consequences.    Ipropose, therefore, that for the presentthe Admiralty should not incur expenditure which commits them to a Fleet beyond, theD.R.C. standard&quot;.^he decision of the Cabinet on the subject had. been set. forth in Conclusion (c)^i) as follows:-&quot;That, as stated in paragraph 59, theMinister for Co-ordination of defence will deal,  in his next Report, with anymodified proposals involving a departure from the TV.R.G. standard which theAdmiralty may wish to suggest, but  thatthe final decision as to an increasedstandard of Naval strength need notnecessarily ^e taken until next year.&quot;As a matter of fa ct he had not received the Memorandumon this subject by the /dmiralty until a^ter his report had been in draft, hut this was not of great importance.for the reason that an immediate decision was notne c es s a ry .So far as the Army was  concerned, he recalled thatthe Scto^er forecast, presented hy the Secretary of st^te for .Var had included a. somewhat vague figure of 100 millions which the Secretary of State had suggestedmight be required for certain items that had not heenincluded,   ^hat item was distributed, under the appro-priate heads in the latest forecast.    Consequently,although the ne^&apos; decisions as to the role of the british army had resulted in the saving of  14 millions upon theField Force, the distribution of this total of  100millions ha-4 resulted in a considerable increase inthe total forecast.   The Secretary of State for War,riehtly, in his opinion, had taken the responsibilityof interpreting the new r6le o^ the Army as involving the possibility of an ^aste^n campaign.    That matter-17-
4     CJl /- was dealt with in paragraph 15 of&quot; his Report.murning to the question of the Air Force, he recalled that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, at theMeeting on December 22nd, had presented, the positionas follows:-&quot;The Air Force wa.s to be increased by theadoption of part of Scheme J......   he pointed out that the authorised programme for the Air Fo^ce at present was Scheme Fand not Scheme j. Consequently what theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence wassuggesting was an advance substantiallyfrom Scheme F in the direction of meetingthe enemy over our own towns.&quot;In paragraph 84 of hi? earlier Report (CP.-316 (37))he himself had advised as follows:-&quot;In regard to our Fighters, given that our main object is the defence of this  country,one of the very last items on which weshould seek to effect a reduction wouldbe the Fighter Squadrons which form partof our defensive system.    The increases in Fighter Squadrons proposed by theSecretary of State for Air as part of scheme J must therefore be accorded thefirst priority&quot;.The Conclusion of the Cabinet had been stated in cabinet 49 f?7)  Conclusion 1 (c)(iii)  as follows:-&quot;&quot;&quot;hat as regards the policy for the expansionthe Air Force no final decision wasreached on Para. 98 (iii) of the Report,but  that the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should, in his  future investi-gat ions&apos;., proceed on the basis of that paragraph and in consultation with theSecretary of State for Air.    In particular,further examination should be made o^ thelinked questions of the provision of war reserves and war potential.&quot;In accordance with that decision the Secretary ofState for Air had prepared a. scheme which did not goas far as Scheme J, but was an advance on Scheme F.He had to admit that the programmes submitted, tohim produced, a. very disappointing result, as set forth in paragraph 35 of his latest. Report (CP.-24 (38)),where it was stated that -
&quot;The intention underlying the cabinet decision o^ the 22nd December last, namely,that the Defence departments shoul^ beinvited to submit revised  forecasts witha view to ^rinninc the total defence expenditure over the five years 193 7-41within a total of  1,^00 millions, hasthus not been achieved&quot;.Moreover, the question of maintenance, dealt with inparagraphs 39 and 5* of his Report, was very important.&quot;Hiere \v*s another matter which was becoming ofgreot import&quot;nee and to which the Chiefs of StaffSub-Commit1ee had drawn his attention, namely, theshortage of skilled labour.   This was dealt with inparagraph 44 of his Report a?3 follows:-&quot;In ^he first place, the rate of progressof the defence programmes is subject tolimitations imposed by the industrial conditions of the country, and in particularby the amount of skilled labour which canbe made available without disrupting our peace-time industrial system.......&quot;There were, therefore,  two limiting factors, namely,first, the amount o** money that could v,e spared, whichwas dealt with in paragraph ^ of his Report as follows&quot;Accordingly,  I propose that the figure of 1,550 millions should be taken as themaximum sum which can be regarded as avail-able for all defence purposes over the fiveyears 1937-41.    Out of this sum it isnecessary to provide for expenditure on certain items given in the table in para-graph 31, i.e.. Air Raid Precaution measures,say  40 millions, other civil defence measuressay  20 millions, and interest on sumsborrowed under the Defence Loans Act, 193 7, 24 millions.    Deducting a total provisionof  84 millions for these items, the total available for the three Defence deparment is therefore, say,  1,570 millions.^6^ Ky first proposal is therefore that this total of  1,570 millions should be prescribedas the limit up *o which the Defence Depart-ments may work for the period 193 7-41.&quot;Admittedly that recommendation would lead up to a difficult position.   His plan for dealing with it was set forth in paragraph 62 as follows:-
&quot;A further enquiry should he undertaken in th-3 year 1939 in order to considerwhether, in the light of the international situation as it then exists, it is on balance regarded as necessary and possibleto authorise defence programmes of a widerscope a.nd involving greater expenditurethan the defence programmes which can becompassed within the proposed limits of 1,570 millions.    This does not, of course,preclude review oT&quot; the authorised pro-grammes at any time if the international situation should undergo such changes as torender possible reductions in those pro-grammes .63.  Tn making thes^ proposals I am anxiousto a.void givine the impression that theywill be easy to carry out,...,.&quot;He had been driven to that  conclusion, as any otherwould drive us into an expenditure which it would beimpossible to provide.Finally he drew attention to the remarks in his last paragraph &quot;as to the importance of reducing thescale of our commitments and the number of our potentialThe First Lord of the Admiralty said he did not accept the statement in paragraph 8 of the Minister&apos;sReport that the Admiralty were exceeding the D.R.G.standard, but he thought that the matter could betterbe dealt with on the next item. o? the Agenda Paper.The proposals for scrapping were of no immediate import-ance to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence&apos;sstatement as this did not arise until 1941.   Theproposals would have some effect on personnel, but thenecessary adjustments could be made next year.Referring to the quinquennium, he pointed, out thatthe expendi+ure on the third Capital Ship would, reachits maximum in 1941.    Tf the Services were now to berationed down to what was  contemplated in this report it. would be impossible to complete the D.R.O. programme.That would react very gravely not only on Defence policy but on our general Imperial Policy, since it would notbe possible to maintain a covering force in the Far East
as well as in &quot;Europe.   All the Naval Powers wereinore-^sIn? their programmes,    fie ourselves onlypossessed three Capital Ships that, had not beencompleted, before the Pattle of Jutland, whereasGermany&apos;s Capital Ships were all of post-19?2construction.The Secret&quot;ry of State for  Va.r a creed, that theFurther Report by the Minister for Co-ordinationDefence was a powerful document.    If, however, theincrease mentioned by ^he Minister would be converted into a reduction and a great economy would be shown.He gave details.   He pointed out that, the Minister&apos;s figures were based on the assumption that theestimates were ^eing carried out.    He gave examplesto show that this was far from the case:    e.g., inregard to anti-aircraft guns, shell bodies, tanks, etc.The figures mentioned were far greater than could,possibly be spent.    From this point of view hecommende^ ^he reference to the question of skilled labour in paragraph 44 of&quot; the Report.    ;Vhen theenouiry foreshadowed for 1939  came to be made it wouldbe equally important to investigate how far futureprogra-mes  could be carried into effect, includingthe question of lahour.The Secretary of State for Air gave an explanation of how the figures stated in paragraph 28 of theMinister&apos;s Report had been arrived at.    Scheme J,which ha^ heen the basis for the Minister&apos;s InterimReport&apos;so far as the Air Force was  concerned, had provided for a larger programme than was now cent em-plated, though it was the minimum which the Air Staffproposals in his^ latest ^emorandum/which was on theAeen*a beforf the Cabinet were adopted, there wouldbe a. large reduction in Ar^y expenditure, a.nd the
thought sufficient as an adequate insurance.    Theestimates had been made as  carefully as possible, andit. yftg int creating to recall that in/193 7 and 193 8,as he was advised, the expenditure would tally almost exactly with the estimate.    The reception of Scheme J.however, had. shown that the expenditure involved was greater than the Cabinet felt it wss possible to meet.That had. led him to draw up Scheme K, which included thefull number of Fighters in Scheme J,  the minimumnumber of Bombers which the Air Staff thought con-sistent with safety, e.s well as the full provision for trade defence and r eeonna.issa.nce.   Even that relativelylimited scheme, however, had resulted in a figure inexcess of the  ^60 millions at which he had to aim.He had then thought i4&quot; right to try and produce ascheme falling short or the provision for our Metro-politan Forces which was deemed necessary by the AirStaff and  t,o make an attempt to produce some schemewithin the financial limits available.   The new scheme,costing  ^67.^ millions, was not what the Air Staffthought ought to be done, but what they thought wouldbe the best value that  could be got for this sum.He hoped the Cabinet would be under no illusion inthis matter.   He noted that the Minister&apos;s reports.ssumed an aggregate expenditure and suggested thatthis should &quot;he divided between the Departments so asto make clear what the expenditure of eQ ch would, bein the years 1938 and 1939.   He did. not think that hediffered from the Minister in   the matter on whichhe was about to spe^k, as he ha.d already discussed,it with him.   He felt bound to say, however, that adecision of this kind would be of no value to theAir Ministry.    Tt was essential to them, if they were
to obtain the production they required, to have a programme looking forward, four or five years ahead.Up to 1939 the Air Ministry were already committed, bycontracts which had been entered, into:    in fact somecontracts went beyon^ that. year,    ^hey were, however,already faced with a. situation in which, unless theycoul^ give orders extending beyond 1939, there wouldbe a gap in production.    This was due to the fact thatsome eighteen months had. to be allowed for the produc-tion of jigs and tools for new types.   Moreover, unless they could give orders on a. large scale they would notbe able to obtain the necessary speed of production.Tn reply to the Prime Minister he agreed, that the pointin regard, to the provision of jigs and tools onlyconcerned new types/   mhe second, point, however.A.relating to speed of production, applied, in the case ofexisting types also, since firms which saw that their orders woul^ be running our in 1939 inevitably sought to spread the time for the completion of the order inorder to be sure of keeping their men together longer.Oth^forwarding\s^ they might lose them before they coul^ carryout/orders for later type-s.    He illustrated this by thecase of the  &quot;Hurricane&quot; aeroplane.   He pointed out,however,  that very little risk was run by giving ordersfor a longer period in the case of aircraft.    It wasnot like the case o^ the Capital Ship, where once theorder was given It had to be carried through.    In thecase of aircraft^ provision was made for a break clause so tha.t the order could be cancelled withAa  comparatively small amount of nugatory expenditure.He suggested, therefore, that the Air Ministry shouldbe allowed, to proceed on the basis of carrying rightthrough the orders for the programmes suggested in the
Report, subject to the inclusion of a break clause.Without that, production would be reduced in future and u-e should not be p&apos;ue to carry out the presentprograr^es . IThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this was as serious a matter as any Cabinet had ever had to face in ti^e of peace.   He had tripd to look at it not from a narrow ^epnrt^ent^1 point of view but as amember of the Cabinet with a v-ider responsibility.He realised that the Treasury must make its  contributionto the national  p-ffort .    He thought it ivould not bewasting the ti^e o^ the Cabinet to st^te certain figures.He recalled that the Pri^e Minister, when he wasChancellor o^ the Exchequer, ha.-5 announced, an effort of re-ar-a-ent involving the enormous figure of 1,^00 millions spread over five years, 0*&quot; which 400 millions were *o be borrowed.    This really was astupendous -^igu^e which it was difficult to realise.It was impossible to get out of the difficulty bymerely saying &quot;Let up borrow some more&quot; .    It was hardenough to borrow  400 millions, and this would involvemuch help from, the City of London.   A first  instalment of this money had been borrowed, and at the time ithad produced a tremendous effect.    mhe Treasury thenbegan to look at the question of how this borrowingwould wo^k out ,    &quot;&quot;hey had. had prepared estimates on two hypotheses,   hypothesis A was on the basis of what had already been approved by the Cabinet, and was foundto involve an expenditure not of  1,500 millions but of 1,690 millions.   Hypothesis B, which was based on theassumption of the new standard of Naval constructionfor the Admiralty, and Scheme J for the Plv Force, hadtotalled  1,900 millions.    Those figures had been veryalarming.    mhe Cabinet had then approved that the
Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should examinethe problem, and the Minister had produced a veryremarkable piece of work.   His effort had been to seeif he oould bring the figures down to  1,500 millions.The result, however, had been a figure of  2,000millions.   He was aware that this was not for went of trying, as everyone had m8de the strongest efforts .The Minister&apos;s suggestion was -for an expenditure of 1,6^0 millions.    This would involve a very heavy strain on the national finances.    &quot;he financial prospects for the immediate future were good, enough,but he was fearful for the future.    Of course therewas no question of announcing a &quot;recession&quot; in thenational finances.   He would be a sanguine man,however, who thought that we could get to the end ofthe quinquennium with the present standard, of financialprosperity.    That was a very serious thought for theChancellor of the Exchequer.   Whenever we tried to revise expenditure it went up.    Tt would be a mostserious matter if, when the examination was made in1939, the expenditure went up again, as by that timetaxation prospects would be worse.   He felt everysympathy for the Defence Departments, and had  come tothe conclusion that he ought to ask for the Report tobe accepted and for action to be taken to give effectto it.   That was to say, he abandoned the figure of 1,500 millions and accepted  1,550 millions;    namely, 1,^70 millions for the Services, the remainder beingfor Air Raid Precautions and. other civil requirements.   he felt he must also agree to the proposal for an enquirytwo years hence, though he did so with a heavy heart.He thought it would be wrong for a. Government, withoutconsideration of the international situation, to say
rigidly that they could not spare more than  X milliorsfor defence.   He wished to place on recor^, however,that the expenditure of  1,650 millions on defencenot only placed a terrible strain on the national finances, but  could not be increased without financialdisorganisation to an extent that would weaken the resistance of the country.   His  conclusion, then, wasthat the Cabinet, ought to accept the proposals of theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence, and that theyshould then ^e worked out in detail.    This wouldinvolve the expenditure mentioned in paragraph 5^ ofthe Report.    The next question would be to divide the 1,570 millions between the Services, and theresponsibility for that should, be placed on the Ministerfor Co-ordination, who would know what assistance heneeded for the task.    Tt meant an assessment of therelative needs of the various Departments.   Thequestion of delay in production, mentioned by theSecretary of State for 7ar, would also have to be takeninto account, as well as the Admiralty&apos;s. difficultiesin the production of armour-pla.te..   Tt would, be theheight of folly to announce a programme larger than could be carried through.    other nations would be encouraged if this were done:    e.g.., Japan.   Promthis point of view perhaps the  conclusion proposed bythe Minister was not so gloomy as might appear atfirst sight.   We should be adopting programmes whichwould not be held up by want of labour or material, as would happen in the case of larger programmes.   he drew attention once more to paragraphs 6 to 14 of theFirst Report by the Minister for Co-ordination (C*P.-316 (37)) which contained a classic statement of the elements th*t made up our strength for nationaldefence.   This showed that the Treasury really ought
to he included ?s one of the Fighting Departments, as their contribution was as great as that of any.The Secretary of state for Foreign Affairsrealise^ that he also ha&apos;&apos; a share of responsibility in these matters.The two points in the remarks of his colleagueswhich had impressed the-selves upon him were, first,the Secretary of State for 7ar&apos;s point about presentdeliveries, which he gathered were, in the case or theAdmiralty ond  7ar Office together, about   10 millionsbelow the expen^i+ure approved, in the Estimates:    and,second, the Secretary o^ St*ste for Air&apos;s point as tothe need for giving orders for aircraft for sov*e years ahead,    This was very important, as next year theinternational situation was not likely tobetter.    The Paper showed that next year we should bea good de^l below the German st-^nderd, and this made any prospect of any further slackening very serious.He suggested that we ought to ascertain more aboutforeign orders.    If more of these could be securedit might be possible to alleviate the situation.murning to the wider aspects of the question, he found it difficult to express views on the programmebecause he dir&apos; not know what was its strategical basis .A hint of this was given in the last paragraph of theReport where it was suggested that we ought to reducethe number of our potential enemies.    Tf the Report-were based on the assumption that we might have tomeet three Powers at once, namely, Germany,  Italy and japan, without any assistance from allies, he recalled that the Americal Admiral Leahy had stated that thiswas the American position, mentioning the same three powers. He was unable to gather, however, whether-^hat was the assumption.
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that we h*dnever yet based our arrangements on the assumptiono^ the hostility o^ three Powers simultaneously.The Foreign Secretary,  continuing, suggested thatit would he wrong to assume that the three powers would all he hostnie without France  being in alliance with us as a minimum.    France had the second Navy inEurope, and her position was much better th**n it hadbeen in 1914.    Cur relations with the *Tnited states were also much better than in that year.    He ratherha&apos;1&apos; the impression that this Memorandum was based onthe very worst assumption and. not on a more reasonableone in which we could  count on the assistance of allies .The Secretary of State for Air pointe-1 out that,so far as the Air Force was  concerned, no suchassumption had heen made . Even Scheme J had provided a minimum, for the Middle East, but that had ^eenquite inadequate to the case of a. hostile I+^ly.Scheme TT, on the other hand, made no provision forany increases in our air forces abroad, and, to speakquite frankly, was inadequate vis-a-vis Germany.The Foreign Secretary then  took up the point asto whether it was possible to reduce the number of ourpotential enemies.   He pointed out that the three powers mentioned each had. ambitions for the fulfilment of which we stood in the way.    Serr Hitler, for -example, stood for what he ha^ written in &quot;MeinFampf&quot;, to which he had since added the colonies.Signor Mussolini had ambitions to restore the RomanEmpireJ and Japan was aiming at aggrandisement inthe Far East.   He did not say that it was impossibleto manoeuvre within these limits, but his difficulties
-4 *)1 ein reducing the number of our potential enemies were based on fundamentals.   He thought that we ought to court our friends and, within limits, to find out whatthey could do to assist us.(The Cabinet then adjourned until 5 P.m.)
4 n n1 0 3At 5 p,ff. the Cabinet resumed their discussion of the question of defence expenditure in Future Years .The Lord President of the Council said that thosewho took a general, as distinct from a specialist,view of these questions were under a debt to theMinister for Co-ordination for his illuminatingReport .    Even so, it was difficult to obtain a clearimpression of these complicated programmes.   He found himself driven to the melancholy conclusion that therewas no finality in armaments.    &quot;&quot;he Cabinet  could neversay that, they had reached the position which theDefence Departments regarded as ideal.    On the otherhand, somewhere in the field of finance there must bea limit to expenditure.    Consequently it. wa.s neverpracticable to cover all our needs.   He was alsoimpressed by the Foreign Secretary&apos;s remarks that the programmes did not take sufficient account of theassistance we might reasonably count on in certaincircumstances from abroad,   He ha^ refreshed hismemory on a recent Report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee containing a comparison of the strengthof Great Britain with that, of certain Powers as at1st January, 1938 (C.P.-296 (37)), which presented aless gloomy picture.   His first reactions, therefore,to the inevitable gap between available expenditure and requirements were, first, that he suspected infact that we should not be able to spend much morethan the  1,500 millions previously contemplated bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer for the reasons givenby the Chancellor himself:    second, that even if wewere unable to spend the  1,650 millions now contem-plated the armaments that we could, provide would
nevertheless furnish a considerable factor in supportof the peace side of the ledger;    and, third, thatthe maintenance costs at the end of the quinquenniummust be a cause of apprehension not only to theChancellor of the Exchequer but to the whole Cabinet.He felt VLso that it w.?s very difficult for any memberof the Cabinet to ignore the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s grave warning   as grave, perhaps, as any Chancellor had ever uttered   as to the dangerof exceeding these figures.    Tn sum, he doubted whetherthe Cabinet had any alternative but to accept the judgment of the Minister ^or Co-ordination,  confirmed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    Tiiat was theirunavoidable responsibility, and he felt it was the dutyof every member to give all possible assistance notonly to the acceptance but also to the execution ofthe plan.&quot;&quot;he Home Secretary said that he did not differbroadly from the  conclusions of those of his colleagues who had spoken.    The Cabinet ought not, however, to ignore the fact that the financial situation countedfor a great d^al with us but not with the nationswhose attitude concerned us.    None of the three nationsmentioned  counted at all the cost of their vast arma-ments .   He v-the^, however, to raise certain definitepoints.He referred first, to paragraph YL&apos; of the Air staff memorandum attached to the Report of the Minister forCo-ordination (C.P.-24 (3S),page 25).    The meaning ofthis paragraph was that, owing to the cutting downoffrom 16 to 9 weeks/the available war reserves, our air Force would have two alternatives, namely, eitherto go all-out at the beginning of the war even thoughit involved exhausting their resources in a. month or
two, or else to go slow and reserve their resourcesmobiliseduntil /    war potential provided, their necessities:in other words,  v;e    would, have to deprive   ourselveso^ our main weapon of war, namely, ability tomaintain a sustained offensive.     As the minister responsible for A.ir Raid Precautions he had to re cog-*nis 3 that this would  deprive us of our first means ofdefence, increase the danger of panic, and result in agreat demand for air raid precautions.   He asked theMinister for On-ordination to treat this as a questionof vival importance in his further enquiries.    It was,indeed, a. vital matter in itself, but even more so ifthe whole picture of air defence was reviewed.   He had recently seen a figure of aircraft production in differ-ent  countries, from which it appeared that the monthlycapacity was as follows:-United Kingdom .......200 a. month.Germany  ..............500  &quot;      &quot;UoFrance  ...............%m- &quot;Italy ................   AA &quot;- in relation to other countriesSo ^ar from increasing our output we were goxn*r back.The same considerations applied to anti-aircraft arms.-ments .    The key point in A .A . artillery, for example,was the     7-inch gun.   TTp to now there was not a singlegun with units.   He sai-1 this not  in criticism, butsmerely ^stating a. fact.    In the next few months we shouldhave a few.    The production of the larger gun (4,^-inch)still remained in the dim and distant future.    Inaddition to that, the general defensive position was deteriorating every rronth.    The Japanese had brought anew complication into our programmes.   He himself hadbeen responsible for drawing up programmes for the new standard, of Naval defence.   His main point, however, was
that if we reduced our war reserves for the Royal AirForce we were playing into the hands of Germany byfs. cil ita t ing t he kno ck-out blow .The Prime Minister pointed out that at the moment the Cabinet were only concerned with the total figureof expenditure and not with its distribution.^he Home Secretary thought it possible that when thedistribution came to be considered in detail it mightbe necessary to raise the total ^figure.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointedout that the total could not be pushed, higher.However, for the moment he was content, provided thatthe question o^ war reserves for the Air Force remainedHis next point was that the Cabinet ought to havefigures of how much we vere actually spending ascompared with the estimates, as thai might affect theultimate programme.   He suggested that a report by theTreasury on expenditure might be included in the monthly review of progress by the Committee of ImperialDefence &apos; former D.P.R.).Next, the Home Secretary suggested that no usefulresults would be obtained by telling the. heads of theServices thai, they must reduce their estimates withincertain limits.    this had been tried before and had never produced good results,    ^he Admiralty, forexample, must have specific directions as to the part which the Fleet had to play.   He was all in favour of taking into account the action of possible allies, butthe Cabinet would get better results if the Navy knew the policy.   The same principle applied in the case of open.^he Home Secretary
1-jthe Air Force.    Tt mieht, he agreed, never be possibleto c*tch up the German air strength.    Tf parity wasimpossible, however, we ouerht to have some alternativepol i cy .    &apos;without s u ch wedown to the  1,6^0 millions.The Lord Chancellor sai^ he spoke as a formerSecretary of State mr Var.    Vhen he had held that office a proposal had been made for rationing theGovernment Departments and he had opposed it, partly because he had thought it impossible for the .7ar Officeto settle their expenditure without relation to that ofthe Admiralty and Air Ministry, and,  in addition, becauserationing- provoked  competition between the Services forthe available funds.   He was  convinced, however, thatthe Minister for Co-ordination had made out his  case.TheChancellor     of    &quot;the Exchequer said that the amount-proposed was the u+most that  could be afforded, and weshould have to cut the Services down to his estimate.this  could only be done by rationing.   He did not. quiteagree with the Home Secretary when he asked the Cabinetto fix a Naval or Air standard,    -&quot;&quot;hat was what had beendone, an- the Departments had done their best to statewhat was necessary.   The figure they estimated, however,was found by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to beunobtainable.Re^errine to the Home Secretary&apos;s remarks as tothe proposed cut in reserves of material for the AirForce, he pointed out that  if this was raised from to 16 &quot;weeks reserve, the other Services would goshort.    In consequence the Navy would be unable to fulfil its responsibility for protecting our fuel and.food supplies.   He felt, therefore, that it wasincumbent upon the Cabinet to accept the advice of ttenever bring expenditure
Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and to lea.veto him and to whoever he might call to his counselto do the best, he could, in the further stages .The First Lor-1 of the Admiralty thought it essential that the Cabinet should give the Services apolicy:    otherwise they would have an impossible ta.sk.If a global sum v/as fixed we were driven back onrationing.    Tf we were actually at war we would neveraccept that position?   orders would be given regardless of expense.    Yhether it was advisable in preparation for war to a*opt a. different system raised a largequestion.The Minister of Transport pointed out that theCabinet had so far been discussing two factors:    first,what was the ideal form of defence, and, second, how much money was available.    He thought that the time factor was as important a? either.    The next two orthree years were really the important period.    It wasnot much use discussing what, would happen in 1942.The Minister of Labour agrer-d in the importance ofthe time factor, and pointed out that when that factorwas raised the question of skilled labour at once aroseHe himself had warned the Cabinet some eighteen months ago about this. He had pointed out, for example, thatshipbuilders could dD a great ^eal *o implement theprogramme except in respect of labour. The longer the.period the better from the labour point of view.The Minister of Health supported, the Report of theMinister for Co-ordination, but agreed, with theMinister of Transport as to the &apos; importance of the time factor.    This discussion made it more important than ever that we should press on with our efforts to havepeace with Germany and Italy,
The President of the Board of Trade consideredthat there was no alternative but to accept theproposals o&quot;&quot; the Minister for Co-ordination for theestablishment of a global figure and a aystem. of allo-cation.   &quot;Ie agreed with the Minister o^ Transport asto the importance of the time factor.    Tf we had fiveyears o^ pease ahead of us. this country, he believed,could dc better than any other.    Tn that time theresources of some othe^ countries would be to a. great extent exhausted.   This fact made the year 1942 ratherhypothetical.   Ke advocate^, therefore, that we should concentrate on what could he done in the next two orthre,c* years .The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat he was driven *&quot;o the &amp;*rr.e conclusion.   Later he must raise the question of what was to be done aboutcommunication with the dominions.The Minister of-Agri culture and. Fisheries shared the general assent to the Minister&apos;s proposals,    &quot;rlewas, however, impressed by what the Secretary of Statefor Air had said about the importance of placing ordersbeyond 1939.    From personal enquiry he gathered thatsome arrangement had been reached.The Minister for Co-or Jination and the Secretaryof State for /jr said they thought it. could be reached.The Prime Minister, summing up the dis cushion,said that the dilemma before the Cabinet was presented,in paragraph 42, namely, that if we accepted the advice of the Defence Departments ^n unbearable strain wouldbe placed on our financial resources, whereas if wecut them do1 n we ran into the possibility of danger ofwar.    The Minister&apos;s proposals appeared to meet withgeneral acceptance,   &quot;&quot;hey were, however, in reality
to some extent an evasion and a postponement of thedecision.    Tn two years&apos;  time the Government might hefaced with a worse financial situation than today,and the prospect of heavier taxation might he verydifficult and unpleasant  to face.    He had felt some doubt, therefore, as to whether he was justified, in accepting, a postponement.   He had only brought himself to it by his hope for some improvement on the inter-national side.    tfe had been working hard for this forsome time, and he thought there was a possible chanceof an alleviation in the situation.   For example,apprehensions of war would be greatly reduced if some agreement  could be reached for the restriction of bombing.   He thought that the prospects were sufficient-ently fair to justify postponing the final decision,though he did not conceal that in the end this post-ponement might involve later on a decisionof the verygravest  character:    nothing less, indeed, than a disastrous deterioration in the financial and  credit-situation .murnir.f to the question of the tempo of provisionof armaments, he realised that the situation was oneof urgency.   Hot long aco he had been asked when themost dangerous situation facing the country was likely to arise.   He had replied that, now was the most dangerous time.    But. no action that could be taken now would alleviate ^tlvatsituation,    Tt had. been suggestedthat the sum proposed by the Minister for Co-ordinationcould not be spent, and this was supported by thefact that we were seriously behindhand, already.An improvement might be obtained, however, by actionto secure skilled labour, which might be effected by putting pressure on manufacturers to release it for
armament work.    that was a possibility that ought tobe kept in mind.    That would mean that we should meet our short-range difficulties and chance the long-rangeones, for the course proposed would involve throwingaway a great deal of good will.   He thought it only right to say, however, that that was a possibilitywhich could he resorted to i,p necessary.Another conside-ro + ion that had to be borne inmind was that if war were to break out within thenext few months it ^ight go on for a long time.Consequently we must always keep steadily in mind, theimporta.nce of war potentialHe thought the Cabinet were ready to accept theproposals o^ the Minister ^or Co-ordination of defence as set ^orth more particularly in paragraphs 26, 58,60 and 62.   Referring to paragraph 60, he did not quite agree with what the First Lord had said on theimportaneeof laying down a policy for the Departments.That had been done, and the Departments had told theCabinet what they considered necessary for safety.mhe Cabinet&apos;s inescapable reply was that our financial resources did not permit, us to provide the whole.At that stage the only thing to be done was to ask theServices to do their best with the provision that could be made.   The proposals of the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence provided the best method of doing this.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said he thought that the Secretary of State for Air&apos;s point about placing further orders could he settled.   he understood that his  colleague would be satisfied withsome percentage (80$ had been suggested, but he didnot pin himself to that figure) accompanied by a
[Communi en.! ion*o the Domin-tions -break clause.   He hoped, therefore, that the cabinet would docile that the Secretary of State for Air shouldhave authority to place contracts while the allocationwas going on, to the extent of an agreed percentage.The Secretary       State for Air explained hov- thedecision would operate.The proposal or the Minister torCo-ordination of Defence was agreedto.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence bald thatin three or four weeks he hoped to he able to reporton the al1ocat ion.The Secretary of Sra+e for Dominion Affairs said he only regretted  that there was not. to be an InperialConference this Spring, as the Report of the MinisterV Co-ordination contained, a. great deal which could conveniently be ma.de known to the dominions PrimeMinisters at an Imperial  Conference.

He suggested *hat he and the Minister forCo-ordination might prepare a version of the Reportfor the information of the Dominions Prime ministers which could be sent under a  covering letter from thePrime Minister.    mwo points woul* have to be borne inmind:    first, to ensure that secrets should not leakout, and he thought there was little chance of this;and, second, that we must avoid alarming some of theDominions unduly.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thatthe production of such a document might not be ea^y,but he was prepared to help.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggestedthat it might b^ better to wait until the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence had completed the next stage ofhis task.The Prime Minister agreed with the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Secretary of State forDo.minion Affairs should be asked to work out somethingfor the consideration of the Dominions Prime ministers and to send it to him in the first instance.mhe Cabinet agreed(a)To approve generally the Further Reportof the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence on Defence Expenditure in future years (C.P.-24 ^8))  as providing forthe due distribution and use of ouraArailabie resources in accordance withthe principles already approved by theCabinet and set forth in paragraphs 6 to14 of the earlier Report (CP.-316 (37) )-the main conclusions of7which may be summed up as follows:-(i) That the figure o^  1,650 millions should be taken as the maximum sumwhich can be regarded an availablefor all defence purposes over thefive years 1937-41.

The allotment of annual expenditure made to each department  for the years 1938-41should govern (i) the expenditure which may be incurred by each department in 1938-39, and (ii) the commitments to be entered into bythe Defence Departments during1938-39 in respect of the remainingyears of the quinquennium (Para.60)&apos;(iv) A further enquiry should be under-taken in the year 1939 in order toconsider whether,  in the light ofthe international situation as it then exists, it is on balance regardedas necessary an-1 possible to authorisedefence programmes of a wider scope and involving greater expenditurethan those which can be compassedwithin the proposed limit of  1,570millions.

It was essential to present Parliament
with some programme with the Estimates.     Ultimately,when the Admiralty were rationed they might have tore-examine the matter.     The Naval Estimates were to bepublished on March 2nd.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had circulated a Paper to show that he could not regard thenew Programmes as being within the authorised limlt6.They appeared to involve a new departure and to prejudice the decisions that had   just been taken.       TheAdmiralty estimates v/ere produced in the form of a largebook.      It was decided, in the first instance, not toinclude new construction in this book, and his idea hadbeen to publish a separate White Paper setting forth quit&quot;briefly whatever decision    was taken on the subject.Possibly, it might be said that the International situatinecessitated postponement of the decision.     The question had either to be settled within   a   week or else some such course must be adopted.The Cabinet v/ere reminded that on previous occasions, when that course had been resorted to,  thereal reason had been due to differences of opinion between the First Lord of the Admiralty and theChancellor of the Exchequer and this might be remembered^One suggestion was that the difficulty over theJapanese intentions as to the size of ships might be used as an excuse for a postponement.     It was pointed out,however, that this would raise difficulties later on.The Prime Minister suggested that it was hardly possible to reach a decision that day and that an effort ought to be made to prepare the ground before theCabinet took a decision.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceoffered to meet the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theFirst Lord on Friday, February 18th, in order to prepare the question for decision at the next meeting of theCabinet.The First Lord of the Admiralty accepted thissuggestion.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To postpone the decision on theNew Naval Construction Programmeuntil their next regular weekly meeting:(b) That, in the interval^: the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence should confer with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the First Lord of theAdmiralty with a view to reaching a conclusion.
I&quot; 1THE ROLE OF 11. The Cabinet had before them, a Most secret the ARMY .  Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Var (C.P.-25 organisation for. (38))  in which he had. drawn up for the informationof his  colleagues a statement of the dispositions(previous reference: and contemplated, organisation of the land, forces, in cabinet 20(37), Con- order to show what resources were available and toelusion 4.)what use it was intended to adapt them in the lightof the new role allotted, to the Army.    The Secretaryof State concluded, his Memorandum with a summary ofhis main proposals.The Secretary of State for War made astatement to the Cabinet,in the course of which he emphasised the following points(1)    The proposal that defence against low-flying attack should be undertaken by employees of factories and publicutility companies.    (paragraph 4 of cp. 26 (38).)(2)    The suggestion that wherever sea communications are liable to interruptionby sea, land or air,  the garrisons ofdefended ports should be maintained inpeace time at a strength adequate for defence at the outbreak of war, or,alternatively,that the necessary reservesshould be held in the neighbourhoodavailable to reinforce at short notice.(Paragraph 9.)(3)    It was his strong hope that the PrimeMinister would initiate conversations between the India Office and the WarOffice with a view to an agreementbetween the two Departments on the all-important questions affecting the british army arising in connection with thedefence of India.On the latter point, the Secretary ofState for India said that a very large problem was raised, but he agreed that it was essential that itshould be considered.      If the Secretary of State forWar would tell him what were their requirements, hewould send his comments and the matter could then bediscussed.     The question of the ratio of white troops
in particular raised large issues.The Prime Minister said he would he happy to initiate the conversations.The Secretary of State for War invited theattention of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tothe suggestion that some of the Dominions might render assistance in peace in the defence of Imperial communications(paragraph 13).The Chancellor of the Exchequer entered a caveatas to the assumptions in this report (which he had seenreflected in other reports) that the new role of the Armyinvolved that the Field Force &quot;should he equipped for an Eastern theatre&quot; (paragraph 11 of CP. 26 (38).)     He would prefer to use some such phrase as &quot;for general purposes&quot;.The Secretary of State for War said that somesupposition was necessary to enable the amount of reserves to be calculated.      It was by making the assumptions inparagraph 17 that he had been able to reduce the estimatedcost of the Field Force by  14,000,000.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that the words &quot;equipped for an eastern theatre&quot;were politically undesirable.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointedout that the Secretary of State for War had to equip theArmy   for  the largest demand that v/as likely to be made upon it in the new assumptions.      If this involved a campaign in an eastern theatre, it would be necessary toprovide special tyres for transport, thin clothing and so forth.The President of the Board of Education pointedout that, according to paragraph 17, the bulk of theTerritorial Divisions would not be sufficiently equipped to proceed abroad until 10 months after mobilization.     he asked if, in these circumstances, it was worth while
maintaining so many Territorials.The Secretary of State for &quot;;ar said he did not differ in theory     from       this view, hut unfortunately publicsentiment would be very much opposed at the present time tothe disbandment of any part of our small     forces and he felt   sure  that nothing could be done in the matter justnow.In reply to a suggestion that more territorial divisions might be converted into anti-aircraft units, theSecretary of State pointed out that by avoiding convertinga third Territorial Division, he had been able to effect a very large economy.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairssupported the idea   of  a further approach to the Dominions.It would not be of very much use to approach Canada andthere were political objections to an approach to theUnion of South Africa, as the only points where they could help us with garrisons in time of peace were in thecolonies and mandated territories in Central and EastAfrica.      It would be possible, however, to approach theAustralian and New Zealand Governments once more about thegarrison of Singapore.     He would place himself in communication with the Secretary of State for War on thesubject.The Prime Minister said he understood that this paper was for the moment only for the information of theCabinet,     As it raised a number of important questions,he thought it should be referred to the Committee ofImperial Defence in the first instance.The Cabinet agreed.j (a)    That the memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War on the organisationof the Army for its role in War(CP. 26 (38) should ha referred, in,the fi st instance to the Ctomau/Otee ofImperial Defence:
(b) To take note that the Prime Ministerauthorised the initiation of. conversations between the India OfficeF .30^*^) fc.       ariQ the War Office on the questions raised in paragraphs 14 and 15 of cp. 26 (38):(c) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should place himself in communication v/ith the Secretary ofState for War on the subject of theproposed further approach to some ofthe Dominions with a view to obtainingassistance in time of peace in thedefence of Imperial communications(e.g. in the garrison of Singapore):(d) That the phrase used in paragraph 17,line 7, of the Report &quot;equip for an Eastern theatre&quot; was politicallyundesirable and that the Secretary ofState for War in future communicationson the subject should be asked to substitute the phrase &quot;for general purposes&quot;.(See also the following conclusion,)
FRANCS AND 12.    In connection with the discussion recordedBELGIUM.  in the preceding Conclusion the Cabinet had beforeStaff Con-Cversations them the following documents, circulated on thef with.Prime Minister&apos;s instructions, which had beenprepared for the Committee of Imperial Defence onthe subject of Staff Conversations with France andBelgium, viz.:-Memorandum by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Commit tee, covering letters from the Foreign Office to theSecretary to the Committee ofImperial Defence dated. 16th December,193 7, Annex I, and. 1st January, 1938,Annex II (C.I.D. Paper No.l394-B):Cable communications between theUnited Kingdom and. France and theirbearing on Staff Conversations:Report &quot;&quot;by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No.l395-B):Exchange of information with theBelgian and French Governments onthe supply of food, oil and coal:Letter from the Foreign Office tothe Secretary to the Committee ofImperial Defence &apos;CI.D. Paper No.l396-B).In his memorandum (CP. 26 (38)) which forms the subject of the previous conclusion, the Secretaryof State for War had included the following passage in paragraph 22:-&quot;I suggest that it is of great importance that our potential allies should be left in no doubt as to the possibilities of direct assistance on our part and thatthe various alternative operations,whether in defence or in local offence,which our available reserves may have toundertake should be covered by any discussions or interchange of information which take place.&quot;The Prime Minister said that this raised thequestion of Staff Conversations with France andBelgium, which had formed the subject of a recentmemorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeeannexed to which was a copy of a letter from theForeign Office to the Secretary to the Committee ofImperial Defence.     He had thought it right to
circulate this memorandum to the Cabinet (CP. 35 (33)),He had discussed the matter with some of his colleagues(the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence) and with&apos;the Chiefs of Staff.     The cabinet would recall that on March 19, 1936, representatives ofBelgium, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, met inLondon to examine the situation created by the repudiationof the Locarno Treaty and the reoccupation of the rhineland by Germany.     The results were published in a document headed &quot;Text of Proposals&quot;, issued as a white paper (Cmd. 3134), which contained the followingDeclaration:-&quot;That nothing that has happened before or sincethe said breach of the Treaty of Locarno can beconsidered as having freed the signatories ofthat Treaty from any of their obligations orguarantees and that the latter subsist in their entirety.&quot;The political   commitments, thus reaffirmedentailed military obligations, and at the present time,as appeared from the documents which had been circulated,,the French Authorities were very anxious for staff conversations, no doubt with the object of defining or at any rate ascertaining the military contributionv/hich we intended to make.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsinterpolated at this point that the same morning he hadreceived very similar requests from the BelgianGovernment.The- Prima Minister continuing said that it hadbeen suggested that this ,was not an opportune time at whichtq^let it be known that Staff Conversations were takingplace.     It seemed to hie colleagues and himself that therewere&quot;special reasons in the case of each of the three defence Departments which made it necessary to have adifferent course in each case.
In the case of the Army, they were agreed thatit was desirable, and indeed an obligation of honour, toinform the French Government of the effect of the recentCabinet decision on the role of the British Army on our capacity to send a military force to France, even if theGovernment of the day should wish to adopt that method ofco-operation.     They recommended therefore -that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should have authority,  through such channel ashe might deem appropriate, to inform the FrenchGovernment confidentially of the recent decision by the Cabinet as to the role of theBritish Army and to warn them that, if theobligation involved in the Treaty of Locarnoshould arise and the Government of the day,after considering our other military commitmentsat home and abroad,  should decide to despatch a military force to France,  the maximum force which our present organisation would enablethem to send would be two Regular divisions and a Mobile Division within three weeks,followed by two further Regular Divisions inZ plus 40 days.     These Divisions would be equipped for general purposes and not withspecial reference to a continental campaign.In making this communication the Secretary ofState might remind the French Government ofthe importance of the Navy and the Air Force/as a means of possible co-operation.So far as the Air Force was concerned, he and hiscolleagues had agreed -that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should be authorised to state that His Majesty1cGovernment, on the understanding that no commitment as to the future was,involved ontheir part, were prepared to authorise confidenr.communications on a purely technical footingbetween the British and French Air Staffs as tothe aerodr-omes and other facilties which wouldbe required by the British Air Force in theevent of a decision by the British Government ofthe day to co-operate in that manner with theGovernment of France.     He should add that asthe re-equipment of the Royal Air Force withlonger range machines was completed,, tb&amp;ivdependence on French aerodromes and facilities would progressively diminish.
In ^01These conversations would he begun through, theAir Attaches, but might be pursued in connection withexchanges of visits by Air Force officers, which takeplace from time to time, and it might be necessary laterfor Air Force officers to visit French aerodromes.He emphasised that the objects of the proposedsteps was not publicity, but merely to keep faith withthe French Government and to make certain enquiries which were indispensable to effective co-operation but without taking a commitment,,He and his colleagues had also agreed that inthe event of a decision to despatch our Fleet to the far east we should need the co-operation of the french fleet to assist in the protection of sea communications in the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Home Areas, but that immediate Staff Conversations were not necessary tosecure this co-operation.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised the point as to what he should say to the FrenchGovernment about the role of the Army.     Was he to saythat the two Regular Divisions and the Mobile division would be &quot;equipped for general purposes&quot;?The Secretary of State for War suggested thatwhen the time came for the communication to be made tothe French, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should approach him on the subject of the technicalaspects of the communication to be made.     He was gladthat the Prime Minister proposed to modify the suggestions of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.     He thought itwas more than ever important in view of the Italianconcentration in Libya that plans should be worked out for French assistance from Tunis, though this specificpoint did not appear to be provided for at present.
The Lord President of the Council suggestedthat however guarded the Air Staff talks might be, ifthey became public an unfortunate effect might beproduced.     What would be the effect here ,   forexample, if it became known that the Germans and italians were discussing the mutual use of each othersaerodromes?The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat tlie fact that we hud a definite commitment arising-originally from the Locarno Treaty seemed to make thedifference.The Minister of Health asked if it wasnecessary to make this communication at once.The Home Secretary suggested that it depended on whether it v/as necessary to make an announcement onthe role of the Army.     If that was necessary, he didnot see how the Air Staff Conversations could be avoided.The Prime Minister suggested that theannouncement to the French Government should not be made until a decision had been reached on the Secretary ofState for War&apos; s memorandum on the role of the Army(CP.  26 (38).The Foreign Secretary said that he had been pressed very hard on this matter for some time by theFrench Government.      He himself did not take the viewthat the effects of a leakage would be very serious.In view of the fact that we had a political commitment,past experience indicated that if it became known thatwe were prepared to implement the commitment, thesituation mi&amp;ht be eased rather than otherwise.One suggestion was that the Germans should be told frankly what we were doing. Another suggestion wasthat if the Secretary of State for War proposed to make
some statement in Parliament as to the new role of theArmy, it would be important to tell the French first.The Minister of Health thought that at themoment an announcement would have a most detrimental effect.The Secretary of State for War read an extractfrom   a   despatch he had received from Belgium, theeffect of which was to show that practical results mightensue from further conversations, for example, arrangementsfor warning of air raid attacks.The Prime Minister suggested that an announcement to the French Government of the new role of the Army could hardly come as a shock, as they had already informed us that two Divisions was all that they had expected.     Sofar as the effect on Germany was concerned, he was inclined to agree with the Foreign Secretary,     They knewwe had certain obligations and could not possibly beshocked if steps were taken to put ourselves in a positionto give effect to them.     If the Germans really desiredconversations, he did not think that an announcement ofthis kind would influence them.     He did not suggest thatwe should go out of our way to inform the German Government.The Secretary of State for Air said that the time factor was important from the point of view of the Air Fo::-ce.At the present moment, owing to the short radius of actionof most of our bomber aircraft, many of them could onlyoperate against Germany if they could use French aerodromes.On the other hand,   by the end of the year nearly all the squadrons would be armed with long-range machines and, inthat event, the utmost assistance they would require wouldbe refueling facilities.     Consequently, from his point ofview, if the conversations were to take place, the earlierthe better.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggestedthat the Cabinet should agree, in principle, to thePrime Minister1 s proposals,    &quot;but    leave the date to he settled.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve, in principle,  theproposals in the prime Minister&apos;sstatement summarised above and,more particularly, the passagesmarked A, B, C, D and E:(b) Thai, the question of the dateof the communication should beleft for later settlement afterconsultation between the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs andthe Prime Minister.(c) That before the communication wasmade to the French and belgian governments, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should consult the Secretary of State for War onthe technical aspect of his statement on the rble of the Army.
RECRUITINGFOR THEDEFENCEQervices .f previous reference:Cabinet 11(37), Con-clusion 7,)13.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Recruiting:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Var (C.P.-2S (38))reporting on the present, positionin the Army and making proposals with a view to further improve-ments, together with an estimateof their cost:A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty &apos;C.P.-25 (38)) putting forward certain proposals regardingthe emoluments of Naval Ratings-&apos;A. Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Air &apos;C.P.-27 (38))reviewing the recruiting problem in the Air Force and setting forth the conclusions he had. reached .The Secretary of State for &apos;7ar explained his proposals to the Cabinet in some detail.    He said that,at the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,he had withdrawn his proposals as to terms of service,but he asked that the Cabinet would allow him to recruitas many men as possible for long service as an exueri-ment.The Secretary of State for India said he didnot wish to discuss the proposals on merits that day*but he must place on record that the proposals of theSecretary of State for War would place a burden on india and Burma which they could not sustain.    He was advised that the figures affecting India in the summary on page 4 of CP. 22 (38) were not complete.His experts informed him that a very large capital and recurring expenditure would be involved.    Inview, however of the conversations which the PrimeMinister had agreed to (Conclusion 11(b) above), hewould not say more at the moment.
If r*The Secretary of State for Air thanked the Secretaryof State for War for the efforts he had made to avoidrepercussions on other Services.    The marriage allowanceproposals would be a great benefit to all the Services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer took the view thatthe changes affecting married men were justified on merits.In present conditions it was impossible to defend theexisting position.    He also approved the proposals for the intake of boys - though he understood from the Ministerof Labour that there might be difficulties as to thenumber - and as to pay.    His only difficulty was in regardto the terms of service.    He doubted whether it would bepossible to obtain a sufficient proportion of short-servicemen, and this might upset the scheme.    He felt he mustplace on record that he was not at present undertaking any contribution to India.The President of the Board of Education suggested that itwould be better to take boys at/the age of 17,  instead of 15.    he regretted that the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposal toreduce the normal terms of service from 7 with the coloursto 5 with the colours could not be carried out.    In regardto the marriage allowance, he recalled that the naval mandid not receive any assistance for transporting his wife and family.    If the soldier was to receive such transport,as well as the provision everywhere of accommodation,  itwould add greatly to the cost.The Secretary of State for War said that in the army the wife had to follow her husband all over the worldoBuilding would go on gradually everywhere.
Some further discussion of a technical character took:place as to the -position of married men and the allowances for v/omen and children.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of the Secretaryof State for War in his Memorandum on recruiting for the Army (C.P. 22 (38))inrespect of -A. Intake of boys.B. Pay.D.    Marriage.but that C, terms of service,  should notbe approved.(b) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor India entirely reserved his attitudetowards the proposals until after the conversations between the Secretary ofState for War and himself provided forin Conclusion 11 (b) above.(c) That,  as an experiment,  the Secretary ofState for War   should be authorised to recruit as many long-service men as hecould.(d) To approve the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Air (CP.  27 (38)) reviewing the recruiting prcoblem in the Air Force.(e) To approve the Memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (CP.  25 (33))regarding the emoluments of Naval Ratings.

The Report contained a number of criticisms,and the Secretary of State for Air was preparing a paperftr.il (2,%) 11 .on the subject.    He was being pressed in the House ofCommons for publication of the Report, but had repliedthat he would publish when the Government had reached itsown decisions on the subject.    Pie proposed the appointmentof a Cabinet Committee on the subject.    While recognising that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was ratherheavily burdened just now, he ashed him to take the chair.The Cabinet agreed:That the Report of the Cadman Committeetogether with the comments thereon of theSecretary of State for Air should beconsidered by a Cabinet committee composed as follows:-The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.

2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,16th February,  1938.INDIA. 21. The Secretary of State for Iiidia drey/ the(Previous attention of the Cabinet to a Memorandum which he had reference:Cabinet 2       just circulated on the subject of the Release of(33), Con-clusion 10.) Political Prisoners in India (CP.  34 (33)).    He hadnot intended to raise the matter at the present meeting,  but circumstances had rendered this urgent.His &quot;emorandum had explained a demand made by theMinisters in the United Provinces and Bihar at theend of the previous week for the immediate releaseof the political prisoners in those provinces.    since then, matters had moved with great raoidity,  andyesterday the two Governments had resigned.    Theydid so because, on the instructions of the Viceroy,the two Governors had declined to act on their advice.The considerations which the Viceroy had to take intoaccount included the effect which an indiscriminaterelease would have,  not in the two Provinces only,but in other parts of India,  e. g.  Bengal and the Punjabiwhere there were 337 and 44 political prisonersrespectively.    He recalled the example of Parmanand,which he had already reported to the Cabinet.Moreover, had the Viceroy declined to use his special powers in this case, particularly under a threat of resignation by the Ministers,  these powers would have become a dead letter, e.g.  on such a question as the pay of the Services.    He did not yet know if all theother Congress Ministries would resign.    The annual conference of the National Gonforonoo was now meeting and the precipitate resignation of the two Ministrieshad brought about *fee situation in which it was verydifficult for either side to give way.
