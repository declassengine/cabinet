O p o\: rjITALY- 1. The Prime Minister recalled that in the DebateRelations in the House of Commons on the 21st February on the latewith.Foreign Secretary&apos;s resignation, he himself had stated(Previous that there was nothing in any of the communicationsReference:Cabinet ST        which ha^ passed between the British and Italian(38) .Governments which in his  judgment would justify the description of a threat or that it was a case of&quot;now or never&quot;.    mhe Leader of the Opposition had then asked for a Yhite Paper.    The Opposition Liberals hadtaken this as a promise, but he did not. think his wordscould be construed as such.    A Question on the subject had been put down on the Order Paper for the same afternoon.    In the late Foreign Secretary&apos;s view twoPapers were relevant to the subject, namely, a telegramfrom the Earl of Perth (No.73 of February 17th)  statingthat Count Ciano had wri+ten a long letter to SignorGrandi urging an e^rly start with Anglo-Italian con-versa tions  &quot;in view of possibility of certain ha.ppenings&quot;and suggesting that in his own view the reference wasto recent, events in Austria:    and another, a. communica-tion from. Lady Chamberlain which he had read to theCabinet but which had not been circulated.    Both these communications had made it appear that what the ItalianGovernment had in mind as rendering early  conversationsdesirable was recent developments in Austria.    Inaddition, Count Grandi had said, that if conversationshad started before Herr Hitler&apos;s action in Austria, theposit ion would have been quite different.    In view oftheir clear reference to the Aistrien situation it wasimpossible to publish these Papers, and on that he intended to stand firm.    mhe real issue was as towhether the Government were under a. threat at the time they made their decision.   He recalled that on theprevious evening, the Minister of Agriculture and
Fisheries, whorc he thanked &quot;Tor his speech in winding u]*the Debate, had stated quite definitely that he himselfdid not &quot;feel under any sense of duress,  compulsion,bullying or blackmail of any kind&quot;,,    He wanted to knowif this opinion was shared by other members of theCabinet.(There was general agreement that thiswas the case .)The Cabinet agreed  (a) ^o authorise the Prime Minister tostate in the House of Commons, inhis own language,, that he had invited,every one of his  colleagues to say whether they confirmed the statementof the Finister of Agriculture andFisheries as quoted above, and that-all had a.greed that this was  correct:(b) To take note that His Majesty&apos;? ambassador in Rome was starting that day fo^ London&quot;/r/?./o^j,^^tha.t his instructions had been in draftsince last September, and, after being brought up to date, would be consideredby the Committee on Foreign Policy:SPAIN. ( c) To take note that the Earl of Plymouthwas arranging to see the Italian Ambassador(Previous about the application of the formula on reference: the withdrawal of volunteers with a viewCabinet 7 to making early progress on the Non-(38). Interven+ion Committee, and  that thepossibility of some difficulties in thismatter must not. be excluded.,,-2-

His Majesty&apos;s government did not differ from their appraisement of- the probable ultimate resul+s of Herr Hitler&apos;transaction, but that they did not agree with their proposals for immediate joint or separatecommunications on the subject to the GermanGovernment, and that he should, explain thereasons for this position.    He should a.d.dthat His Majesty&apos;s Government wrould prefer that the matter should, be raised by Sir nevile henderson in his forthcoming talks with herr hitler:(b) That the Despatch should, be so framed as tomake the utmost allowance for the susceptibilites-biiities of the French Government:( c) .Tha.t the Lord President o^ the council should also prepare an appropriate instruc-tion to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlinas to the line he should take in raisingthis question with Herr Hitler:(d) That it would be premature to adopt, aproposal that was made during the discussion to approach Signor Mussolini with a view tohis sending a message to Herr Hitler urginghim not to put. too much pressure on Austria.s

The Prime Minister recalled -that, as mentionedjap^n and in the Cabinet Conclusion referred to in the-margin,early in february.ry the Japanese Ambassador ha.d made an[$Previous approach to the Foreign Secretary a.nd. had begged himReference:Cabinet ^S&quot;     &quot;to consider whether we could not informally approachf38) , Con-clusion 9.)    both sides&quot; with a view to an end to the conflict.    Theproposals of the Ambassador had struck the Prime minister as opening up possibilities, and. he had asked if it wasthe intention of the Foreign Secretary to follow up thesuggestion.    The Foreign Secretary had replied in the affirmative.   He asked the Lord President, of the Council,as Acting Foreign Secretary, to look into the matter.The Lord President of the Council undertook todo so.

9 n qt* u .ypAwIIOAD-HAIPA 5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (C.P--K?(38))  covering a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CcI*B. P?per No. 139S-B) on *he strategic and certain other aspects of the construction of a road from Baghdad to Haifa, and quoting the following conclusions thereon reached by the Committee ofImperial Defence at their 3C9th Meeting (Minute 4):-&quot;(a)  To recommend the proposal for the con-struTbion of a road from Haifa &apos;c.oBaghdad., at a cost of approximately 600,000, for approval by the Cabinet.(C . I .Do Paper No * 1293-3.)(b) That the priority to be assigned tothe construction of the road shouldbe decided by the Cabinet  j.n coraec-ticn with the general review which theMinister for Co--ord ire.bion of defence would shortly present.( c) That v;hile a decision on this questionwa.s bound up with the next stage of thefinancial review, in which questions of priority would be dealt with, the Cabinet-should be asked to bear in mind that ifthe road is to be completed, by the winter of 1939-40, a very er-rly decision isne ces s ary:    ot henvis e a d el ay of oneyeQr in the completion of the road willbe entailed.&quot;In the course of the discussion the Secretary ofState for India, expressed the view chat, while theconstruction of the road was a matter of import mce.when considered in comparison with the Naval route to Egypt through the Red Sea. it- was only a secondary^eans o^ communication .   Prom the point of view of priority, therefore, its provision should  come secondto the defences of Aden and. the measures for protect-ins? the Naval route.In this connection it was pointed out- that ourpreoccupations about Aden and the Red Sea route aroseentirely out of our recent estrangement from Italy,k Tf, as the result of the forthcoming Conversations,those relations  could be placed on a better footing,the urgency would diminish.
After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed(a) To approve the construction of theproposed road and its expenditure,as set forth in recommendation (a)above, not only for the strategicalreasons set forth in the report before the Committee of ImperialDefence but. as a great Imperialproject calculated to consolidateand strengthen our position through-out the Middle East, and to improvenot only our military but also oureommer cia 1 communi cat ions be tv.r eenEgypt, Palestine, Trans-Jordania,Iraq and India:(b) That, as recommended, by the Committeeof Imperial Defence, the priority tobe assigned to the construction of theroad should be decided by the Cabinetin eonnection with the general review which the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence would shortly present:( c) To take note that the Minister forQo-ordination of Defence deduced fromthe Cabinet discussion and conclusions the strong impression that their inten-tion was that he should give the road a sufficient priority to enable it tobe carried out at an early date:(d) mh8t the financial aspects of the Roadshould be considered, by the treasury in conjunction with the Departmentsconcerned, including -(i)  the incidence of cost on Depart-mental Estimates, bearing in mind the importance of avoiding givingthe impression that the Roa.d wasbeing built exclusively for strate-psychological  reasons:(ii)  the suggestion made at the meeting that the Iraq Petroleum company should be asked to make a contri-but ion *
SOUTH AFRICA.The HighCommissionTerritories.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(38), Con-clusion 8.)6, The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that he did not wish that day to ask for any decision on the question of thetransfer to the T.Tnion of South Africa of the high commission Territories.   He had had some communica-tion with General Hertzog, who, however, had been much preoccupied with a crisis over the NationalAnthem.   For the moment all he proposed to do was toask the Union Government to allow him to see theirlatest draft of the proposed Memoranda for communication to the Territories in question.
9^9DEFENCE.Statementrelatingto.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(38), Con-clusion 9.)7. The Cabinet had before them a Note hy theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence fC.P.-38 (38))circulating for the consideration of his colleagues the draft of a Statement Relating to Defence.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That members of the Cabinet v.-ho had.suggestions to make for amendmentsor additions to the draft White paper should, at once communica.te them tothe Minister for Go-ordination ofDefence:(b) That the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should  consider these amendments and prepare a further draftof the White Paper in consultation withThe Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Home Secretary,The Minister of Health;( c) S^Kl^^&amp;^i^o^^^tW^ing:for Co-ordination of Defence to thefollowing suggestions that were made atthe Meeting:-(i) The inclusion o^ a fina.ncial para-graph if the Chancellor of theExchequer should, find it possibleto produce a draft appropriate tothe present political conditions,namely, one that, would, convey theimpression that the financial burdenwas heavier than had been anticipated,without  causing excessive anxiety asto our financial  circumstances:( ii) That the re-draft should, include afinal paragraph setting out thegeneral impression that it was desired, to create at home andabroad.:(iii) &quot;hat the paragraph referred, to in(ii) might, if thought, fit, include a reference to foreign affairs, or,alternatively, that there might be aseparate paragraph on foreign affairs:(iv) That in the sixth line of paragraph4, after the word, &quot;demands&quot;, thefollowing should be inserted:-&quot;on the supply of certain materials&quot;(Suggestion of the Minister of Labour):
-12-(v)  That in the eighth line of paragraph4 the word &quot;any&quot; should be oni+tecand that the following words shouldhe substituted:-Kas far as possible&quot;,so that the line would read:-&quot;to avoid as far as possibleinterference with the re-quirements of private industry&quot;-
elusion 10.)out briefly the main reasons why in his view theProgramme should be substantially reduced, both ofwhich had received consideration at the meeting mentioned in the margin, when a decision had. been postponed, pending consultation between the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence and. the First Lord of the Admiralty with aview to reaching a conclusion, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord. ^C.P.-42 ^38)) pressing strongly for the adoption of theoriginal Programme.   But in a very sincere effort to meet the wishes of the Chancellor of the Exchequerhe submitted a. revised Programme,  costing  48,278,850.Tt was a. Programme, however, that  could be defended,in Parliament, and. was one that the A^dmiralty would accept on the understanding that, the items dropped,from the previous Programme had only been deferredand not. abandoned.In the course of the discussion, theChancellor of the Exchequer quoted figures to showthat the sketch 1928 new construction programmeincluded in the third D.R.G. Report which was estimated at the time of that Report to cost 36 millions would now cost  44 millions, and that thecost of the actual 1937 new construction programme had risen by  9 millions. In other words,NEW NAVAL CON-      8.    Tn addition to the Memorandum by the FirstSTRUCTTONPROGRAMME, 1938. Lord of the  Admiralty &apos;C.P.-29 (38))  givingdetails of the proposed new Naval Construction,(previous reference: costing  70 millions, and the Memorandum by theCabinet 5(38), Con-        Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.-30 (38)) setting
the Admiralty had already anticipated r:::.zii of the pr posedexpenditureThe aggregate figure for the three years would amount to  180 millions which was hardly consistent with the 200 millions contemplated &quot;by the Defence requirements committee for 7 years.     In addition to this, he had recently learnt that the figure of  62 millions for 1937would rise to  69 millions owing mainly to a rise inprices.     Viewing the matter from the widest point ofview, he recognised that it would not be proper to limit the cost of the Naval Construction Programme to thefigure of  36 millions contemplated by the defence requirements Committee (CP3 42 (38)) fifth page headed &quot;A&quot;.He thought, however,  that the reduced Programme preparedby the First Lord of the Admiralty, for which he thankedhim, was greater than our financial circumstances would justify.      He suggested that this should be cut down toabout  43 or  44 millions and, in this connection, he drew attention to the very heavy aggregate cost of someof the minor items in the Programme, e0g,, one destroyerdepot ship  1,550,000;    one submarine depot ship  1,350,000;one fleet Air Arm supply and repair ship  2r000,000,     Hewas unable to accept any such condition as that set forth in paragraph 7 of CP, 42 (38) that the Board ofAdmiralty would accept the First Lord&apos;s Scheme &quot;B&quot; only&quot;on the understanding that the items which had been dropped from the previous Programme have been only deferredand not abandoned&apos;1.The view was expressed by several Members of theCabinet that, in the present International situation, itwas of first importance that no impression should be created at home or abroad that we were   in any wayrelaxing our efforts to strengthen and recondition the
q ri r*6 i -jFighting Services and that from this point of view, itwould be desirable to accept at least Scheme &quot;B&quot; costing 48 millions submitted by the First Lord, and to make provision in addition for laying down a third capital ship.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointedout that he had been given the very difficult task of rationing the expenditure of the three Defence Departments.If the Cabinet were to anticipate his Report by allottingso large a sum to Naval Construction, his difficulties would be much increased and the other Services were likelyto go short.  kj^ The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs referred  to the message from the Prirno Minister of Australia, whichoperationDefence.    had been communicated to the Cabinet at the meeting referredous&apos;ence j.et 5con-on 1.)&apos;to in the margin offering further co-operation in defence bythe Commonwealth of Australia; and suggest-ed that Australiamight be asked to build u third capital ship.After some further discussion as to the sum to be allotted to the Naval Construction Programme, on thesuggestion of the Prime Minister the Cabinet agreed:(a)    That the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence,  the Chancellor of theExchequer and the First Lord of theAdmiralty in consultation with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs,as required, should at once considerthe Naval Shipbuilding Programme in thelight of the Cabinet diooasion includingthe suggestion that the co-operation ofthe Commonwealth of Australia should besought with a view to their bearing thecost of %he bJrB?eL&apos; capital ship:That the First Lord of the admiralty should have authority to announce anyProgramme of Naval Construction agreed by the above Ministers, but that if theycould not reach agreement they should inform the Prime Minister with a viewto the matter being considered at aspecial meeting of the Cabinet.(The Home Secretary left the Cabinet at this point.)
9 n rjft f i9.    The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (CP. 40 (38))outlining the course of the negotiations for a trade agreement with India.At the suggestion of the President of the india.TradeNegotiationswith.(previous reference:Cabinet 37 (37^Conclusion 15.) B0ar(i Qf Trade, the subject was adjourned until theF.R.10next regular weekly meeting of the Cabinet.
10. The Cabinet had before then a Memorandum by the &apos;Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-39 (38))reporting that an agreement had been reached with the bacon Industry covering organisation, marketing arrangements and factory rationalisation,  conditional on the industry being satisfied, with the Governmentsfinancial proposals.   The cost to the Exchequer of theproposed assistance to the industry should not exceedin the first year  1,180,000, in the second year 1,220,000, and in the third year  1,120,000, subjectto a small rise or fall according as prices of bacon and feeding-stuffs fluctuated.   The Minister soughtapproval to his proposals, in which the Secretary ofState for Scotland concurred, in order that legislation to give effect to them coul^ be completed and brought before the Committee of Home Affairs and. Cabinet, inthe ordinary way at an early date.After the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries had explained the proposals in CP. 39 (38),the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the Cabinet an appreciation of the financial aspects of the proposals.These involved subsidies both to pig breaders and baconcurers whose profit would be partly dependent upon fundsderived from taxation.     He suggested a large reductionin the numbers of pigs for which provision should bemade.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury had now informed him that the urgency of this question was not quite so great from the point of view of theParliamentary time-table and suggested that the matter should be referred to the Committee on agricultural policy.
The Minister of Labour, who is not a member     (jof the above Committee, asked that they would bear inmind that his Ministry were under strong pressure toarrange that wages in bacon factories should be sevtledbetween the Trade Unions and the employers.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesundertook to bring this point up at the Committee, whichhe hoped would consider the question on broad lines.The Cabinet agreed:That the proposals in CP. 39 (38)should be referred to the CabinetCommittee on Agricultural Policy,which should consider the matter on broad lines and report back to theCabinet.
THE RABBITSBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 2(38), Con-conclusion ion 9.)11.In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had. before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheries (C.P.-36 (38)) in which he suggested, after consultationwith the Chief Whip and. Parliamentary Counsel andwith the concurrence of the Secretary of State forScotland, that no further action should be taken atthe present time with reference to the preparationof a Rabbits Bill for introduction into parliament as proposed in CP.-2 (38).The Cabinet took note of the above.
