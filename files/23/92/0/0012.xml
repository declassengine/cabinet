1. The Cabinet met as a matter of urgency toconsider the situation that had arisen in central europe as a result o** recent events in Austria, whereDr. Schuschnigg, the Chancellor, had resigned, hisGovernment had been driven out of power, the Navi;;iswere in charge, and. German troops had already crossed the frontier.The Prime Minister said that although there was probably not very much that could be done, he had thought it right that the Cabinet should meet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat there was not much information to add to what hadalready appeared in the telegrams  circulated to theCabinet.   He had. felt, however, that he would likethe advice of the Cabinet on the general situation.The sequence of events stood out clearly from thecirculated telegrams.   After the interview between his Majesty&apos;s Amba.ssad.or in Berlin and the german chancellor it had. been clear that Herr Hitler wasaiming at some action in Central Europe.   He himself had had a talk with Herr von Ribhentrop on his arrival,in the course of which he ha.d spoken to him seriouslyabout the German attitude towards Austria, as revealedby the Borohtoagadcn conversations.   A record of^-thi-s-had been transmitted to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inBerlin, who, under instructions, had communicated, it toBaron von Neurath.    On Friday, March 11th, Herr vonRi^bentrop had lunched with the Prime Minister, and.shortly after lunch the news had arrived as to the ultimatum to Austria.   He and the Prime Minister had then had a very serious talk with Herr von Ribbentrop,who had professed to be ignorant of the whole situa-tion and had eventually left them to telephone to Berlin.
0 A  tfj   KJLater in the afternoon, Doctor Schuschnigg had asked forimmediate advice from His Majesty&apos;s Government as to what heshould do in response to a demand that he should resign.After consultation with the Prime Minister, he had repliedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government could not take theresponsibility of advising the Chancellor to take any courseof action which might expose his country to dangers against which His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to guaranteeprotection.     He hoped the Cabinet would approve that course.The Prime Minister recalled that DoctorSchuschnigg had not asked advice before announcing the plebiscite which had caused so much trouble.(The Cabinet approved the line taken by thePrime Minister and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairscontinuing said that later in the day  he had had a furthertalk with Herr von Rihbentrop, who still professed to bemuch in the dark as to what was happening in Austria andrepudiated the idea that Herr Hitler could be actingindependently of the German Foreign Office.     During thesame day, the French Government had asked us whether wewould be willing (l) to make an enquiry in Rome as to theattitude of the Italian Government and (2) to make a protestto Berlin.     The latter protest had actually been made.Enquiry was also to have been made in Rome, but through some misunderstanding in cyphering the message to Rome had been delayed.     In the meanwhile, the French Charge d&apos;Affaireshad asked to see Count Ciano to make his enquiry and hadreceived a curt message that if the object of the interviewwas Austria, that was a subject regarding which the ItalianGovernment had no reason to concert with France or GreatBritain.     The Earl of Perth had then asked for instructions
as to whether he was still to proceed with his enquiry.The Secretary of State, after some consideration, had decided that the Earl of Perth should seek an immediateinterview with Signor Mussolini, since his only object was to inform the Duce of the action we had taken and to invite him to give us his views.     Even if this approach was rejected, he had thought it might he useful to havethe fact on record that we had made the approach.     Inaddition to the above, he had sent a long telegram to washington in order that the United States government might be informed as to developments.     The questions that he thought the Cabinet might usefully consider were as follows:-(1)   What steps should be taken to guide publicopinion, and(2)   How were we to prevent similar action beingtaken in Czecho-Slovakia.He mentioned that after the meeting of the Cabinet hewas going to see Major Attlee, the Leader of the OppositionLabour Party.      ^A little later in the meeting, the foreign secretary read telegrams that had arrived since thelast circulation of telegrams to the Cabinet includingBerlin Telegram No. 97 in which Sir Nevile Hendersondescribed an interview with General Goering.The Prime Minister supplemented the statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.     The impressionleft on his mind by a conversation with Herr von Ribbentropwas most unfavourable.     Not so much because he found himhostile as that he seemed stupid and vain and incapable of comprehending and passing on what was said tohim.     He had first talked to the German ForeignMinister before the arrival of the telegrams from Austria.
Herr von Ribbentrop had been at pains to say that it hadbeen his life&apos;s ambition to bring about better relationswith this country.     England to him was a second home, andhe was deeply disappointed at the failure of his mission.He thought, however, that the present moment might bebetter as both countries were strong and it was easier for nations to deal with one another when they were bothstrong than when one was strong and the other weak.     Hehad said that the present Government in London was a realistic Government and had expressed the wish that theywould find    it   possible to be realistic in Central Europe.He had only referred very briefly to colonies.     Heevidently   realised that some action was intended un austria this year, but he did not know what was going proportionate the moment.     The Prime Minister presumed that DoctorSchuschnigg, by announcing his Plebiscite, had givenHerr Hitler an opportunity that he would not miss.     ThePrime Minister had agreed with Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;general thesis and had pointed out that the presentOpportunity might not recur.     He agreed that theMembers of the Cabinet were realists, but what they wantedwas a peaceful attitude of mind in Europe to which germany must make her contribution.      If she did so, she would find us not unreasonable.     He had added that,while theGovernment adopted a realist attitude towards the affairs of Central Europe, they were altogether opposed to the useof force.     He had referred to the possibility of disarmament and had asked Herr von Ribbentrop to tellHerr Hitler on his return that he had hoped that thePuhrer would take up this question with a view to releasing4*4   4:   *&quot;&quot;*
funds t o &quot;be expended for the benefit of his country,,At this point came the news of events in Vienna.     this had been followed by a conversation in the -Cabinet room at which the Foreign Secretary and he had dealt ratherfirmly with Herr von Ribbentrop over the questionof the ultimatum0     At the end of that conversation,Herr von Ribbentrop reverting to the previousconversation had said &quot;I will give your message to theChancellor&quot;.The manner in which the German action in Austriahad been brought about was most distressing and shockingto the world and was a typical illustration of powerpolitics.     This made International appeasement much moredifficult.     He recalled that in a recent speech in theHouse of Commons, he had asked the Opposition to say whatcountry could appeal to collective security with any prospect of success.      The Opposition had not answered.Herr Hitler&apos;s action provided the answer.     The PrimeMinister observed also how fortunate it was forPresident Roosevelt that he had held up the issue of his proposed message.     In spite of all, however, he felt thatthis thing had to come.     Nothing short of an overwhelmingdisplay of force would have stopped it.     Herr hitler had been meaning to take this action for some time andDoctor Schuschnigg&apos;s hlunder had given him the chance.There was little doubt that Hitler would represent it as another illustration of peaceful methods.     He would claim that Doctor Schuschnigg^s policy had made bloodshed inVienna certain and he had stopped it by his prompt action.The German people would, undoubtedly, swallow that tale.So he believed that what had happened was inevitableunless the Powers had been able to say &quot;If you make war on Austria you will have to deal with us&quot;.     At any rate
the question was now out of the way.     He could notconceal from himself that it might he said with justicethat we had been too late in taking up the conversations with Italy.     He recalled that the Italian ambassador had told him that Signor Mussolini would have movedtroops to the Brenner Pass at the time of the Berchtesgadentalks, but he had not felt sure of his position in theMediterranean.     The nest question that had to beconsidered was how we were to prevent an occurrence of similar events in Czecho-Slovakia and he hoped that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs would consider thisquestion with the French, who had a treaty with Czecho-Slovakia and had announced their intention to fulfil it.Coming to the question of whether immediate action of any kind should be taken, the Prime Ministerread a letter he had received from the First Lord of theAdmiralty (absent indisposed) who had suggested thatin order to impress Germany and world opinion, which wouldnot be impressed by an ineffective protest, an announcementmight be made next week that, owing to recent events, theGovernment had decided to reconsider the Naval programme and to lay down three capital ships instead of two, sevendestroyers instead of none and seven submarines instead ofthree.     The Prime Minister himself had also reflected onthe possibility of increasing the Defence Programmes, but his mind had turned towards the Air Force rather than theNavy.     He did not want to express a final opinion andhe thought, in any event, it would be premature to make anannouncement of that kind the same day, but it might haveto be made soon.In the course of a subsequent discussion,  theMinister of Transport gave the Cabinet particulars of an
0 K 1t) J 1announcement &quot;broadcast from German News Stationsafter Doctor Schuschnigg&apos;s farewell speech.He also gave the Cabinet some particulars of    a communication he had received on the previous day from an official of a well-known public company inGermany stating that German officials were beingcollected for employment in Austria and that Czecho-Slovakia was to be dealt with in the same manner asAustria.   The Sudeten Deutsch were to rise and that wasto be an excuse for an invasion.     The official had added that the talk about colonies was bluff.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat on the previous evening the officials of the ForeignOffice had proposed to insert in the message to president Roosevelt a passage to the effect that it waspossible there might now be a breathing space, but that ifforces of order could not be mobilised there would be a repetition of what happened in Czecho-Slovakia-    He hadcut the passage out, not because he necoaearil-y- disagreedwith it, but because he thought the subject required further exploration.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed the Cabinet that he had sent an information message to theDominions on the previous evening and that a telegram was now being prepared as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sG-overnment.In the subsequent discussion a good deal of consideration was given to the possibility of someexpansion and acceleration of our defence forces.    Thegeneral view was that any such expansion and accelerationshould be applied to our Air Force and Anti-aircraft defences.The Cabinet were reminded that the House ofCommons, after recent events, would be in a different frame of mind for discussing the defence estimates next week than had been the case in the present week.The Cabinet were informed that the Right Hon.Winston Churchill was intending to attack the Governmenton the ground of the inadequacy of their Air ForceProgramme and to support the motion of the oppositionfor an enquiry into the Air Ministry.    It was suggested
r- !&quot;that a speech belittling our effort might have a very adverse effect on the international position just now when the only hope cf saving Czecho-Slovakia from the German menace was by creating an impression of force.The Secretary of State for Air recalled thatin connection v/ith the recent enquiry by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence into our future^defence programmes,he had submitted a Scheme &apos;K&apos;, which wasythe minimum Schemeconsidered necessary by the Air Staff for security.    TheCabinet had decided that it was more than we could afford to undertake.    His suggestion was that he should be given authority to take immediate steps to prepare thepreliminary work necessary in case it should be considered desirable to put Scheme &apos;K&apos;  in operation in 1939.    Thiswould involve preparations in factories, training schools and,  above all, in the difficult question of findingsufficient skilled men for the maintenance of an expandedRoyal Air Force.    These preparations could be made withoutprejudice to the ultimate number of machines to be provided.This would enable the Government to say that they were taking all the steps necessary for further expansion.This proposal led to a discussion on the possibilityof accelerating the existing programmes.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointed outthat that raised the question of skilled labour, which wasa very difficult subject that could not be settled withoutmost careful examination.    It was not merely a questionof doing away with the assumption that there was to be no interference with trade.    The difficulty was to inducefirms that were carrying out remunerative civilian contracts to release skilled labour for armament work.    He had lately
gone into the question and had come to the conclusion that,instead of abolishing the present rule,  it would be better to press forward as rapidly as possible with the methodsthat had already proved not unsuccessful in securing morelabour for armaments.The Secretary of State for War supported thesuggestion that some further expansion and acceleration of our armaments should be announced, and,  if possible,within the next forty-eight hours.    He suggestedthat it should apply, not only to the Air Force, but alsoto Anti-aircraft Defence.The Secretary of State for Air supported thisproposal.
q rThe Prime Minister warned the Cabinet againstgiving the impression that the country was faced with theprospect of war within a few weeks .   He was inclined to favour an increase in the Air Force and an acceleration ofthe anti-aircraft defences, but he was opposed to including any reference to the matter in the Communique&apos;, to be issued after the Meeting of the Cabinet.    Any such announcementmust be made first to the House of Commons.^The best plan would be for the Cabinet to meet on Monday, March 14th,and for the Secretaries of State for Air and War to circulate Memoranda of their proposals for increasing andaccelerating the programmes of aircraft and anti-aircraft defence respectively.    If the Cabinet could, reach a decisionon Monday on these points it would, clarify the situation from many points of view.   For exa.mple, if it was considered necessary to expand, or accelerate our armaments, that might involve consulting the Trades Union leaders, and wouldenable the Government to surmount difficulties which had been pointed out in connection with a proposal that the foreign secretary should send for these leaders in order to acquaintthem with the present position.    If the Government had decided on an increase in the Air Force, this would, enablethem to approach Mr Churchill with better prospects ofsuccess.    In the event of it being decided to increase ourarmaments he did. not think it would be wise to announce that commercial work was to be interfered with.   He thought,however, that there were probably a-good many things that could be done to expedite war work short of this.Towards the end. of the Meeting a short, discussion took place as to the form of the Press announcement, whichwas eventually adopted as set forth in Conclusion (a)below.
