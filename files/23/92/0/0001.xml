FOREIGNAFFAIRS.The UnitedStates ofAmerica.Italy.Germany.  ,  ,,(previous reference:Cabinet 46 (37)Conclusion 10.)t)1.     The Cabinet met as a matter of urgency to nconsider the results of discussions at the CabinetCommittee on Foreign Policy during the preceding weekconcerning our policy towards the countries mentionedin the margin.The Prime Minister apologised for the short notice at which the Cabinet had been assembled.      Hesaid that the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy had held several Meetings during the preceding week,which had resulted in the despatch of importanttelegrams to Washington.      In the ordinary way a verbal report would have been made to the Cabinet bythe Foreign Secretary at the regular weekly Meetingon Wednesday next.      On Tuesday, however, theForeign Secretary had to leave London for a Meetingof the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva.It had therefore been necessary to summon the present meeting.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the story was so complicated that he had prepared a precis, which he read to the Cabinet.(A copy of this is on record in theSecretary&apos;s standard file of Cabinetproceedings.)The Prime Minister then made a statement tothe Cabinet supplementing the Foreign Secretary&apos;remarks.(A copy of this is also on the record inthe Secretary&apos;s standard file.)After some discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the course adopted by theCabinet Committee on Foreign Policy:  j(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take advantage of thepresence of the French Minister ofForeign Affairs at Geneva to inform him that we had not yet made any progressin the conversations with the ItalianGovernment but that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had been considering the kind
of settlement they might hope to obtain 1in return for recognition of theItalian position in Abyssinia, and should!ascertain the views of the FrenchGovernment on the subject.      He shouldhave in mind the desirability of inducing M. Delbos to make anannouncement of the French Governments   i?approval of Anglo-Italian conversationswhenever they are opened:That no useful purpose was likely to be   ^served by a discussion of recognition &quot;of the Italian position in Abyssinia at theforthcoming Meeting of the Council ofthe League of Nations, and if any such discussion was contemplated the Secretary!of State for Foreign Affairs should endeavour to discourage it: IThat the Secretary of State for Dominion EAffairs, in consultation with theForeign Office,  should prepare the draft Iof a telegram for despatch to theDominions after the Prime Minister&apos;approval had been obtained:That as soon as President Roosevelt&apos;sreaction to the telegrams sent to washington on January 21st was known,the question should be taken up offurther progress in the Italianconversations:That it was desirable, if practicable,to discontinue the use of the term&quot;de jure&quot; recognition of the Italianoccupation of Abyssinia, and to substitute some phrase which wouldsimply imply a recognition of aninternational change, e.g. &quot;recognitionfor international purposes of the conquest!of Abyssinia&quot;, or &quot;recognition of theItalian position in Ethiopia&quot;;    and that both the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should have this inmind:    for example, in drafting thedespatch to the Dominions:To take note that the Cabinet Committeeon Foreign Policy had met the same afternoon to consider the proposed conversations with the GermanGovernment and had made some progress.
JAPAN.Relations with.previous reference:Cabinet 48 (37)Conclusion 5.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.24th January, 1938.2.      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  1gave the Cabinet indications of some alleviation inthe tension in the Far East, instancing Mr. Hirota*recent speech and the criticisms of the JapaneseGovernment in the House of Peers, which tended to confirm confidential information received by theForeign Office.In this connection also he referred toexchanges of views with the American Government whichhad led, inter alia, to the despatch of AmericanCruisers to the ceremony of the opening of the newDock at Singapore. -A
TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.SECRET ADDENDUM TO CABINET    1(58).aThe Secretary oj State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing Summary of events leading up to the recent proceedingsof the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy as well as thediscussions at the Committe&quot;eTOn the evening of January 11th Mr. Sumner Welles,Under Secretary of State, called on Sir R.  Lindsay by directionof the President of the U.S.A. to convey a direct and verysecret message from Mr. Roosevelt to the Prime Minister.      ThePresident,  &quot;being deeply impressed by the progressive deterioration of the international situation, 1 proposed to take an initiativealong the only lines which, in the state of public opinion in theU.3.A., are open to him.     His initiative was designed to work&quot;as an action by the U.S.  Government parallel to the efforts which H.M. G.  in the United Kingdom are making with the CentralPowers. &quot;     The President explained that he was communicating hisscheme to H.M.G.  alone and stipulated that no other Governmentshould be informed of its nature or even of its existence.     he added that he would only proceed with this scheme if, not later than January 17th (i.e. six days after the scheme was communicatedto Sir R. Lindsay), he received an assurance from the PrimeMinister that it would meet with &quot;the cordial approval and whole-hearted support of H.M.G,&quot;     In that event the President plannedon January 20th to warn confidentially the Governments of France,Germany and Italy,  as well as ourselves, of the general lines ofhis scheme and on January 22nd he intended to announce his plans to the Diplomatic Corps at &quot;Washington, whom he would sumnon to theWhite House for the purpose.This is the plan.      The President begins with a preambleof four paragraphs explaining that he has been led to take this initiative because he feels that the standard of conduct between nations has been deteriorating and that rearmament cannot beexpected to prevent the conflagration towards which the worldseems to be drifting.     For these reasons the President suggests&quot;that :,all Governments at an early date strive to reach a unanimous agreement upon the following matters:-
(l)   Essential and fundamental principles which shouldbe observed in international relations.(2)   Most effective methods for achieving limitation and reduction of armaments.(3)   Methods through which all peoples may obtain theright to have access upon equal and effective terms to raw materials and other elements necessary for their economic life.(4)    In the unhappy event of war,  rights and obligations of governments both on land and at sea except in so far asin the case of certain nations they may be determined by existing international agreement;      the laws and customsof warfare whose observance neutrals may be entitled torequire.&quot;The President&apos;s message finishes with a reference to two matters, viz. inequities of post-war settlement and theAmerican attitude to international affairs, to which special attention should perhaps be drawn.     As regards the  inequities,the President says &quot;it is possible that before the foundations ofa lasting peace can be secured,  international adjustments ofvarious kinds must be found for the pacification of the universein order to remove such inequities as may exist by reason of thenature of certain settlements reached during termination of theGreat War.&quot;     As regards the U.S.  attitude, he says &quot;the tradition-al policy of freedom from political involvement which the U.S.Government has maintained and will maintain is well-known. &quot;It is added, however,  that,  if the President&apos;s plan is foundacceptable, he &quot;gladly pledges the co-operation of the U.3.Government in seeking the attainment of the objectives sought.&quot;The President&apos;s idea, Mr. Welles said,  is that,  if he receives a certain measure of support for his plan, he will then,not summon a world conference, but invite certain governments to send representatives to Washington to negotiate on the points mentioned in his draft.      These Governments are to be Sweden,the Netherlands&apos;, Belgium, Switzerland, Hungary, Jugoslavia,Turkey and three Latin-American governments.     His hope, Mr.Welles explained, was that, while these negotiations are proceed-ing in Washington, their initiation will give an impulse to thenegotiations of H.M.G.  and Prance with Germany and Italy and thePresident will desire Ho M. G.  to exchange full information on the
course of their separate negotiations.In forwarding the scheme Sir R. Lindsay expressed theview that the Presidents plan was a genuine effort to relaxthe tension of the world and that if H. M, G. were held to blameby the U. 3.   Government for killing the scheme before it waspropounded by withholding their support,  this would annul allthe progress made in Anglo-American co-operation during thelast two years.    He, therefore, very earnestly urged acceptance.The telegraphing ^s on this subject from Sir R.  Lindsaywere received in the Foreign Office on Wednesday, the 12thJanuary.     The following day, Thursday, the 13th January, thePrime Minister came up to London and on his instructions, a reply was sent to Washington.      In his reply., the Prime Ministerbegan by expressing the highest appreciation of the mark ofconfidence which the President had shown in consulting him inregard to his plan.      He went on then to explain the positionof our own efforts to reach a general appeasement by improvingrelations with the Italian and German Governments.      The PrimeMinister explained that in each case we were adopting the same basis - namely, that all parties can and should make their contribution.      In the case of Italy, the Prime Minister saidthat &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared, for their part&quot;if possible with the authority of the League of Nations to&quot;recognise de jure the Italian conquest of Abyssinia       if they&quot;found that the Italian Government on- their side were ready to&quot;give evidence of their desire to contribute to the restoration&quot;of confidence and friendly relations.&quot;     The Prime Ministermentioned these facts so that the President might considerwhether there was not a risk of his proposal cutting across our efforts and whether it would not be wiser to hold his hand fora short time and see what progress we could make in beginning to tackle some of the problems piscemal.      &quot;This would not ofcourse prejudice the larger effort that the President might be willing to make later on.&quot;     It was pointed out that these were only the Prime Minister&apos;s preliminary reflections and that he-*3-
Qheld himself in readiness to consider immediately any observationswhich the President might wish to make.     At the same time itwas pointed out to Sir R. Lindsay that there were certain phrasesin the Presidents draft plan which caused grave misgivings - forexample,  the two phrases to which attention has been drawn above(i) about the traditional American policy of &quot;freedom from political involvements,&quot; and (ii) about the removal of &quot;suchinequities as may exist by reason of the nature of certain settie-ments reached at the termination of the Great War.&quot;On Saturday, the 15th January, we heard from Sir R.Lindsay that he had passed the Prime Minister&apos;s message on to thePresident and that the President would send the Prime Minister a written reply on Monday,  January 17th.      The Under-Secretary had told the Ambassador that the President would, in his reply,indicate his willingness to postpone his scheme for a while, butthat Mr. Roosevelt felt a little disappointed.     By the time of thereceipt of this telegram on Saturday evening I had returned toLondon and seen this correspondence.      I accordingly sent a telegramat once to Sir R. Lindsay,  saying that if the President wasregistering disappointment at finding a negative attitude on our part, I was convinced that that was not the impression which thePrime Minister intended to convey.      I added that I was going (toChequers) on Sunday,  the 16th January, to consult the Prime Ministerand the President would surely understand our difficulties owingto the very short time given us for considering his far reachingproposals.     On Monday, the 17th January, the Presidents reply was handed to Sir R. Lindsay and it was received in London on thefollowing morning.      In the Presidents reply he began by sayingthat he greatly appreciated the very frank and friendly spirit inwhich the Prime Minister had replied to his message.    In view ofthe considerations the Prime Minister had advanced, he said &apos;*I amwilling to agree to defer making the proposal I had intended tomake for a short while, as he (the Prime Minister) suggests,in order that His Majesty&apos;s Government may see what progress they
can make in beginning the direct negotiations they are -aontem-plating.&quot;     He continued that he was concerned by the statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government, under certain contingencies, mightrecognise de -Sure the Italian conquest of Abyssinia, in particular for two reasons:1.    because of the &quot;harmful effect&quot; that it might have&quot;upon the course of Japan in the Par East and upon&quot;the nature of the peace terms which Japan might demand from China,&quot; and2.    because &quot;a surrender by H.M.G. of principle of non-recognition at this time would have a serious effect&quot;upon public opinion in the U.S.A.&quot;He added that U.S. public opinion &quot;will only supportthe Government in measures of specific co-operation with otherpeace loving nations of the world, provided these measures ofco-operation are destined to re-establish and maintain theprinciples of international &quot;law and morality.&quot;     Finally, thePresident asked to be kept informed of developments of ourdirect negotiations with Germany and Italy.     In sending this message from the President, Sir R. Lindsay pointed out that thePresident did not regard the door as being closed, but that he(the Ambassador) had been impressed at receiving this warning inregard to de lure recognition from the President and Mr. Hull,particularly as the Under Secretary&apos;s commentary on it delivered onthe Presidents instructions was even more emphatic than theactual message.     Sir R. Lindsay reported that &quot;the Presidentfelt that opinion in the United States was crystallising even then favourably in the direction he de^irefi.     He was confident that de ,iure recognition of the Ethiopian situation given inwrong conditions would turn it right back.......... It wouldrouse a feeling of disgust;    would revive and multiply all fearof pulling the chestnuts out of the fire;    and it would berepresented as a corrupt bargain completed in Europe at theexpense of interests in the Par East in which the United states were intimately concerned     ......He saick that in order to-5-
avoid unfortunate repercussions here solution would have to befound on some collective basis by which it would be possible todraw actual recognition into harmony with normal and moral inter-national procedure.&quot;The Presidents message was received on the morning ofTuesday,  the 18th January,  and was discussed between myself andthe Prime Minister on that afternoon.     As a result, the PrimeMinister decided to call a meeting of the Foreign Policy Committeefor the next day.     Meetings of the Committee were held onWednesday, the 19th January, afternoon; Thursday, the 20th January,afternoon; and Friday, the 91st January, morning and afternoon.As a result of these discussions two messages were senton Friday evening, January 21st, to Washington from the PrimeMinister.    The first, after expressing appreciation for the fewday&apos;s delay which had been most useful for further consideringthe President&apos;s proposals, stated that the Prime Miniister didnot feel &quot;justified in asking the President to delay the announce-ment of his scheme any longer. &quot;     The Prime Minister added that hewarmly welcomed the President&apos;s initiative and would do his best-to contribute to the success of his scheme, whenever the Presidentdecided to launch it. For the Ambassador&apos;s guidance we explained to him that our position was as follows:-(i) In all circumstances we wanted the President to take his initiative.(ii) We therefore desired to give the President sufficientfriendly encouragement to ensure his taking hisinitiative.(iii) We felt, however, that many criticisms can be levelledagainst the substance of his proposals.    In case they received a bad reception after they hadbeen launched, wewere anxious neither, on the one hand, to share theresponsibility with the President for them, nor, on theother, for the President to be able to say that we had given him no warning but unqualified encouragement.(iv) We wished, therefore, that the President should be aware that we thought that there were points to be criticised,  e. g. the procedure to be adopted, theirritation it might cause to the dictators and Japan,and the great difficulties that may arise about thetwo main points of his scheme, limitation of armaments and equal access to raw materials.
In addition, as it seemed that the President might nothave fully grasped our position as regards de nure recognition,the Prime Minister sent a second message, giving a full expositionof the situation as we saw it.      In particular it was pointed outthat we did not contemplate granting recognition except as part ofa scheme of Mediterranean apoeasement and that, therefore, wewould not in any case contemplate doing it until we had worked outthe substance of an agreement which both sides would be willing to conclude.     This would naturally take time.So far we have had no reply from the President.    Asa result, however,  of Sir R.  Lindsay&apos;s conversation with the under Secretary on Saturday, January SSnd, when he communicatedthe Prime Minister&apos;s message for Mr. Roosevelt,  the followingpoints emerged:-(a) Mr. Welles thought that the President would be pleasedwith the Prime Minister&apos;s response and that Mr. Rooseveltwould probably wish to propound some questions to H.M. G.which would be conveyed as soon as possible. *(b) He thought that the President would be relieved to find that E.M.&apos;G.  only contemplated the grant of de ,jure recognition as part of a general settlement with Italyand, therefore, not in the very immediate future.Mr. Welles said that &quot;the President regarded recognitionas an unpleasant pill which we should both have to swallowand he wished that we should both swallow it together&quot;.(c) Our doubts about the wisdom of the phrase in the Presidentsdraft about the inequities of the post-war settlementstruck Mr. Welles as reasonable,  and the Ambassador hadthe impression that the President might be willing tomodify it.      Mr. Welles did not, however, seem to thinkthat it would be possible to make any change in the phrase about the traditional American policy of freedom from political involvement, as the Under Secretaryconsidered it would be necessary for sake of U.S.public opinion.
The Prime Minister supplemented the statementcf the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with the remarks which may be summarised as follows;The Cabinet would see that the Foreign PolicyCommittee had. been placed in a dilemma.     On the onehand, they very much wanted to secure American co-operation and to draw into closer relations with theUnited States.     On the other hand, they had receivedthese rather preposterous proposals to whioh theGovernment were asked to give whole-hoarted co-operation.The Cabinet would probably agree that PresidentRoosevelt1s scheme, containing nothing new and merelysetting out four old principles, would most likely beunpalatable to the Dictator States *     They would realisealso that the representatives of certain small States,who were to be summoned to Washington to discuss details,were not likely to bring abofct world appeasementsThe Committee^ aim had been to get rid of the phrase referring to &quot;involvement&quot;, but %o do so withoutupsetting the president and, in addition, to get him teunderstand the real importance of de jure recognitionof Italy in Abyssinia^     Some members of the Committee had felt that the President did not realise that recognitionwas only contemplated as a possible result at the end of a negotiation, and that the object was to get rid of theperils of the immediate situation.     Some also had feltanxious lest Germany and Italy might be frozen eff taking part in ihe discussion   of concrete proposals for re-establishing peace when the President&apos;s vague propositionswere published.     To meet this dilemma, the Committee had decided to agree to publication and, at the same time, toput forward a carefully argued ease as to the proposed
Italian conversations and de jure recognition,,Up to now the Presidents view had not beenreceived but only the re-action of the Under-Secretary ofState in Washington, whose opinion did not always reflectthat of the PresidentHe felt that the Cabinet ought to receive full particulars at the earliest possible moment in reply to a question, he said that there was noquestion of asking the Council of the League of Nations as yet to deal with the question of recognition of Italy*The time for that had not yet come.     What was required wasto open up conversations with Italy.In reply to another question, he said that theCabinet Committee on Foreign Policy had made some progressthe same afternoon on the subject of the German conversations,and he hoped that it might be possible to make a move withGermany before long*
