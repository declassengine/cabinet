aegean british war DEBT TOTHE UNITEDSTATES of America,(previous reference:Cabinet 40(33)).1, The Cabinet met as a matter of urgency to take decisions on the American War Debt.In the course of the Meeting the Chancellor of theExchequer read to the Cabinet Telegram No.302, whichhad been sent to Washington on June 11th as the resultof the Cabinet Meeting on June 10th (Cabinet 39 (33),Conclusion 2).(Copies oif the two telegrams sent as theresult of this Meeting, Nos . 301 and302, are attached for convenience ofreference&apos; in Appendices I and II).The Prime Minister recalled that the above tele-grams had been sent to Sir Ronald Lindsay in orderthat he might sound President Roosevelt informallyas to whether he could make a statement complyingsufficiently with the conditions on which the cabinet would be willing to sanction the offer of a tokenpayment.   He recalled that on the previous evening,when the Cabinet met, the indications had not beenvery favourable as to the President&apos;s probable reply,but it had been decided to await the text before taking any decision.The following telegrams, which had arrived duringthe night, were handed round at the outset o? theMeeting:-Telegram No, 400 from Sir R. Lindsay(Appendix III), containing a drafttext of the Note that the&quot;president was prepared to send in reply to ourdraft Note contained in telegramNo. 302:Telegram No.401 from Sir R. Lindsaycontaining the text of a statement which would be made by president roosevelt at the time of the exchangeof Notes (Appendix IV);
Telegram Wo. 402 from Sir R. Lindsay(Appendix V) emphasising the Presi-dents view that public opinion inthe United States would resentacceptance of so small a sum as ,000,000 Dollars;    that the effecton Congress, which might still bein session, was to be feared;    and containing an appeal for the largerfigure of 10,000,000 Dollars.The Cabinet noted that telegrams Nos. 400 and 401were marked &quot;en clair&quot;, and it was ascertained byinquiry from the Foreign Office during the meeting that they had been despatched &quot;en clair&quot; by ordinarycable.The Chancellor of the Excheqt^er pointed out,however, that no figure was mentioned in these&quot;en clair&quot; telegrams .The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefollowing passage in Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s telegram No .401(the draft statement to be issued by the President):-&quot;It seems the part of fairness and wisdomto postpone formal representations onthe debt subject until the summer orautumn.   Meanwhile the World EconomicConference is beginning under most favourable auspices and it is vitally necessary that during the opening days of the Conference difficult and possiblyprotracted discussion of the debt be avoided&quot;:and to the following earlier passage:-&quot;The British Government availed itself of this principle following the paymentof the December 15th. payment and Ihad informal discussions concerningthe debt with the British Ambassadoreven before my inauguration&quot;.Both these statements were felt to be particularlysatisfactory as confirming passages in the draftBritish Note contained in melegram No.301.The Cabinet agreed with the advice of theChancellor of the Exchequer, supported by the PrimeMinister and the Lord President of the Council, that president Roosevelt&apos;s statements were reasonably satisfactory and should be accepted.

It was noted,  in
i^njount of payment.Form of payment .ime of publication.particular, that the statement to be issued by thePresident would be contemporaneous with the officialexchange of notes, since the opening words were&quot;The British Government has today announced .,.....&quot;Having agreed that a payment should be made,subject to the exchange of Notes and the Presidentsstatement as set forth in the telegrams, the Cabinetthen proceeded to discuss the amotint of the payment .The Cabinet agreed with the Prime Minister andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer that the differencebetween 5,000,000 Dollars and 10,000,000 Dollars wasnot sufficiently great to justify adhering to thelower figure, in view of the strong appeal from thePresident contained in Telegram No. 402.The Cabinet were reminded by the Chancellor ofthe exchequer\ier that if it were found possible to obtain a final settlement of the American Debt during thepresent financial year, the Lausanne Agreements couldbe ratified and possibly a final settlement with ourown debtors might be achieved; in which event we might receive some payment to counterbalance the 10,000,000Dollars .There was a short discussion on the question ofthe form of payment and a statement in Sir RonaldLindsay&apos;s telegram No. 402 that if 10,000,000 Dollarswere offered, payment in silver would, be regarded asnatural and unexceptionable.   The form of payment,however, was felt to be a matter for the Chancellorof the Exchequer, in consultation with the India Officeif he contemplated payment in silver.The Cabinet then discussed the question of the timeof publication,   ^hey were reminded that the Chancellorof the Exchequer had to speak in the House of commons that afternoon.   They were informed by the Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs that by prompt actionit should be possible to obtain agreement on publica-tion at, say, noon American time, which would be5 p.m. here.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer could therefore give notice to the Leader of the Oppositionthat he would speak late in the Debate in the hope ofbeing able to make an announcement .There was some reference to the possible effect ofan announcement on the City, but as there had been muchtalk in the Press of a token payment it was felt thatin all probability the business effect of the newdecision had been discounted to some extent already.The Cabinet then discussed the question of a communication being made to the French and italian governments, and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook, before the Meeting of the Conferenceat 10-30 that morning, to try and see the principalFrench and Italian Delegates and inform them confident-ially of the position.On this latter point the Cabinet felt, on the onehand, that it was essential to inform the French andItalian Governments at once, and, on the other hand,that the risk of leakage was discounted to some extent by the fact that Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s telegram   has beensent &quot;en clair&quot; .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should forthwith send a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washingtonauthorising him to accept the Presidentsoffer of an exchange of Notes accompaniedby a statement by the President as follows:-(i) The Note contained in TelegramNo. 302, of June 11th, to Sir R.Lindsay, subject to the following amendments in the last paragraph(para .11):-The substitution of 10,000,000Dollars for 5,000,000 Dollars:
The substitution for the lastwords &quot;would desire such negotiations to take place&quot;of&quot;the following:    &quot;would desire such negotiations to be begun&quot;*(ii) The Presidents draft replycontained in Sir RonaldLindsay1 s Telegram &quot;Wo .400(Appendix III):(iii) The Statement to be issued bythe President contained in Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s TelegramNo. 401 (Appendix IV).(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should also ask Sir Ronald Lindsayto arrange with the President for publi-cation of the Notes and the Statement at noon, Washington time, i.e., about 5 p.m.in London:(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should arrange to speak not before5 p.m, in the Debate in the House ofCommons the same afternoon, in orderthat he might be in a position to publish the Notes and Statement:(d) That the form       in which the payment was to be made was a matter for theChancellor of the Exchequer to decide:(e) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should see the principal Frenchand Italian Delegates at the monetary and Economic Conference the same morning,if possible before the Plenary Meeting,and inform them of the Cabinets decision:(f) To place on record that the long and difficult negotiation had reached asatisfactory stage and that this fully justified the Prime Minister&apos;s recent visit to Washington.

APPENDIX I. ^ i*NO DISTBTRTTTTfW.Cypher telegram to Sir R.Lindsay (Washington).Foreign Office.   June 11th, 1933. 7.35 p.m.No.301.xxxxxxxxxxTIM) I ATE.Position disclosed in your telegram 395 appearssubstantially less favourable than conversation with president reported in your telegram 382 led us to expect.We feel strong objection to the constant use of thewords &quot;part payment&quot; or &quot;payment on account&quot; as they indicatean entirely different conception to that which the cabinet had in mind.   They were prepared to contemplate a token payment which would represent an acknowledgment of the legal obligationin the nature of a peppercorn.     It would be difficult tojustify this to public opinion here if figure were increased to010 millions which could not be regarded as other than asubstantial payment.We would not of course insist on the use of the words&quot;token payment&quot; if they give rise to difficulty in America,and if the President will avoid the use of the words &quot;partpayment&quot; or &quot;payment on account&quot;.    what we would suggest isthat we should use some such phrase as &quot;a payment of X million dollars as an acknowledgment of the debt, pending a final settlement&quot;.     This was the expression used in the conversations at Washington in April and appears to meet the case.   This isa point of drafting and agreement but a vital one from thepoint of view of presentation here.For our part we feel that the words after Conferencein last sentence of paragraph (e) of your telegram 395 are open to strong exception.     We much hope therefore that president will agree to omit these words, and will confine his reference to &quot;the circumstances that make it vase to raise no serious issues at the moment of the opening of the EconomicConference&quot;.All this shows that it is essential for us to see the exact text of the President&apos;s proposed reply and particularly
his proposed White House statement about default, as we must be certain that this is satisfactory before we send our official note.In regard to paragraph 3 of your telegram No.390 I must point out that we could not, on the showing of your telegram No.364paragraph 3 use this line of argumentation, for the Americans havemade it plain from the start that the proposal must ostensiblyoriginate from us, and that they would repudiate any suggestionthat it came from them in any way.As to your paragraph 2 of the same telegram we also haveII our public opinion to think of, and as explained above there would; be a considerable difference in the implications here of 5 and 10itI million dollars respectively.     Any possibility of a change in theIfigure at this stage would necessitate a further reference to thesI Cabinet, who only with great reluctance and considerable divergenceII of opinion, agreed to the lower figure.     I could not in any case,1 or with any hope of success, re-submit the higher figure forI consideration, even in silver which would work out at about 8: million dollars - the ballon d*essai of the White House or state Department described in your telegram No.397 - without havingi before me the exact text of the official reply to our note and ofI the &quot;moral indemnity&quot; now contemplated by the President in the formof a statement from the White House.    And even so I should haveto be sure that the terms of such an indemnity would be, in yourI opinion, substantially affected by the difference between 5 and 81 millions.     So far as we can judge here the effeGt in the UnitedI States of America at either figure cannot possibly be anything butunfavourable.     Do you differ from this view.We should like the President to make a contemporary declarationJf that he personally did not regard the United States of America as inthe presence of any default.    We cannot put ourselves in the positionof both making a payment and of being regarded as defaulters.    TheCabinet will not. agree to any payment unless we can thereby obtain some quite specific and authoritative moral indemnity from the
President,   They would be very unlikely to agree to any increase of payment beyond 5 millions unless they were convinced that such an increase was necessary in order toobtain the indemnity required.My immediately following telegram gives draft ofour Note which we should be glad if you would show to president. It has been drafted in as non-contentiousmanner as possible but we will of course consider any suggestions that President may desire to offer.As already intimated Chancellor will have to stateposition on Tuesday.   It is therefore most important thatnotes should have been exchanged and White House state-ment made before then.   A very early reply is desirable in case the Cabinet have to meet again on Monday evening.

APPENDIX    II.NO DISTRIBUTION.Code telegram to Sir R. Lindsay (Washington).Foreign Office.      June 11th, 1933.      6.45 p.m.No.  302.    (R).MOST IMMEDIATE.1.      In reply to the note handed to me by the state department on the 9th June I am directed by my Governmentto make the following communication to you.2.      It will be recalled that the general views ofHis&apos;Majesty&apos; s Government on V/ar Debts and oh theirrelation to the present world difficulties were explained in the notes exchanged in November and December last.His Majesty&apos;s Government at that time decided to makepayment of the amount due on the 15th December, but theyindicated clearly that this payment &quot;was not to beregarded as a resumption of the annual payments contemplated by the existing agreement&quot; and they announced their inten-tion of treating this payment &quot;as a capital payment ofwhich account should be taken in any final settlement&quot;.3.      Finally, they pointed out that the procedure adopted &quot;must obviously be exceptional and abnormal&quot; andthey urged upon the United States Government &quot;the importanceof an early exchange of views with the object of concludingthe proposed discussion before the 15th June next in orderto obviate the risk of a general breakdown of existinginter-Governmental agreements&quot;.4.     His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomadopted this procedure because they recognised the peculiarPosition in which the then United States Administration
was placed, and the impossibility of their undertakingany effective discussion of the problem at that time.His Majesty&apos;s Government acted, however, on the under-standing that a discussion would take place withoutdelay, upon, the provisions of the existing agreement inall its aspects, so as to arrive at a comprehensive and final settlement, and in the belief that payment on the15th December would greatly increase the prospects ofa satisfactory approach to the whole question.5.     Negotiations were accordingly attempted even before the new administration was inaugurated, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have been most anxious to pursue them as rapidly as possible.On the occasion of the Prime Ministers visit to washington the President and he made preliminaryexplorations as to the basis of a clearer unstanding of the situation.      For reasons not within the controlof either Government however, it has not yet beenpossible to arrive at a definite conclusion of these negotiations.6.     A speedy conclusion is, however, urgently needed.The treatment of inter-Governmental obligations mustclosely affect the solution of the problems With whichthe World Conference has to deal, because they cannotbe separated from the influences which have brought theworld to its present plight.     For instance, it isgenerally agreed that one of the first and most essentialof our aims should be to increase the general level ofcommodity prices.      It may be recalled that after the lausanne Conference there was a marked tendency for prices to rise, but that this tendency was reversed when the
prospects of a final settlement of inter-Governmentalobligations receded, while the December payment was accompanied by a sharp fall in prices, which was felt in America at least as much as in Europe.     Experiencetherefore appears to show that the effect of these payments upon prices is very direct.7.     In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government itis essential for the success of the Conference thatthe delegates should not be hampered and harassed bydoubts about the possibility of a satisfactory settle-ment    of War Debts.     The payment   of a further instal-ment of the Debt at this juncture would inevitably be judged to mean that no progress whatever had beenmade towards such a   settlement, and would therefore deala damaging blow at the confidence of the delegates.8,     In the circumstances and in view of their actionlast December His Majesty&apos;s Government had hoped thatthe United States Government would have been able to accede to the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government to postpone the payment of the June instalment pending thediscussion of War Debts as a whole.     Since, however,this does not appear to have been found possible HisMajesty&apos;s Government are obliged to decide upon their course of action.9.     Such a decision must in any case be of an extremely difficult character and in considering itHis Majesty&apos;s Government have felt their deep responsibilitynot only to their own people but to the whole world
which is awaiting the deliberations and recommendationsof the Conference with the utmost anxiety.10.     The conclusion at which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave arrived is that payment of the June instalmentcould not be made at this juncture without gravelyimperilling the success of the Conference, and involvingwidespread political consequences of the most seriouscharacter.     In their view the instalment should be con-sidered and discussed as part of the general subject ofWar Debts upon which they are anxious to resume conversationsas soon as they can be arranged..11.      In the meantime,  in order to make it perfectly clear that they do not regard the suspension of the june payment as In any way prejudicing the ultimatesettlement, HisMajesty&apos;s Government propose to make animmediate payment of $5 million as an acknowledgmentof the Debt pending a final settlement.     If as they trust the Government of the United States is there-after prepared to enter upon the formal negotiationsfor the ultimate settlement of the whole War DebtQuestion, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to beinformed of the time and place at which the UnitedStates Government would desire such negotiations tobe begun.iv*
APPENDIX IIINe Distribution.Telegram (en clair) from Sir R. Lindsay - (Washington).  -D.   5.25 p.m,  June 12th.1933.-R.  12.45 a.m.  June 13th.1933,-No.400.-MOST IMMEDIATE.In reply to the note handed to me by the Ambassador forHis Majesty1s Government,  I am directed by the President to makethe following reply.The President understands that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have concluded that payment of the June 15th.instalment &quot;could not be made at this  juncture without gravelyimperilling the success of the Conference and involving wide-spread political consequences of a most serious character&quot;.He notes also the fact that accompanying this communication isa payment of ---- million dollars  &quot;as an acknowledgment of the debt pending a final settlement,&quot; and notes the characterisatiorof the circumstances with which the British Governmentaccompanies this payment, although he does, not concede some ofthe statements concerning economic cause and effect containedin His Majestyrs Government&apos;s communication,The President points Out to His majesty&apos;s government the well known fact that it is not within his discretion to reduce or cancel the existing debt owed to theUnited States, nor is it within his power as President to alter the schedule of debt payments contained in the existingsettlement.        Such Pov/er rests with the Congress.He notes, likewise, the suggestion of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that they desire to make further representationsconcerning the entire question of debts, and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment requests that a time and place be indicated where such representations can be made to    the President or theappropriate representative of the Executive.
9 9 *)W *JThe President suggests that, if it is convenient,His Majesty&apos;s Government provide for such representations tohe made in Washington on approximately July 17th,Any results of such a discussion of the debtquestion can be submitted for the information or theconsideration of the Congress when it next meets.Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances ofmy highest consideration.Acting Secretary of State,Ends.
APPENDIX   IV.NO DISTRIBUTION.Telegram (en clair) from Sir R. Lindsay, Washington.Do    5.25 p.m. June 12th, 1933.R.    1*00 a.m, June 12th, 1933.No. 401.    MOST IMMEDIATE.Following is statement to he issued by   President.The British Government has to-day announced payment to the United States of..........million dollars witha note indicating that this payment is t o be considered*.as an acknowledgment   of the debt pending a final settlement&apos;.     It has in its accompanying Note pointedout circumstances that have induced it to. take this action.Such payment does not of course in any sense pre-judice the freedom of either government in any subsequentdiscussion of the entire debt question which will take account of this and other debt payments.      I announced in November, 1932, a policy to the effect that a debtormay at any time approach a creditor with representationsconcerning the debt and to ask for readjustment of the debt or its terms of payment.     Under such circumstances the debtor government makes such representations as itdeems of importance with respect to the desirability ofany readjustment in the terms already agreed upon.      TheBritish Government availed itself of this principlefollowing the payment of the December 15th   payment and Ihad informal discussions concerning the debt with theBritish Ambassador even before my inauguration.      On theoccasion of the visit of the Prime Minister of GreatBritain in April further exploration of the subject wasmade Ay us and additional discussions were held &quot;by the experts of the two governments.     Time and circumstances
would not permit any definite conclusions in these discussionsBecause at the moment both governments were vitally concernedin making prepsr at ion for the World Monetary and EconomicConference in London.      It seems the part of fairness aid wisdomto postpone formal representations on the debt subject untilthe summer or autumn.      Meanwhile the World Economic conference is beginning under most favourable auspices and it is vitally necessary that during the opening days of the Conferencedifficult and possibly protracted discussion of the debt be avoided.In a spirit of co-operation I have as executive notedthe representations of the British Government with respect tothe payment of the June 15th. instalment inasmuch as the pay-ment made is accompanied Oy a clear acknowledgment of the debtitself. In view of those representations and of the paymentI have no personal hesitation in saying that I do not charac-terise the resultant situation as a default.Beyend this the law and the constitution do not permit meto go.      The American public understands clearly that thesettlement under which these debts are now being paid was madeunder the authority of Congress andthat Congress alone has theright to alter the amount and method of payment of this debt.Further than this, the Congress in December, 1931, in approving the moratorium in June ef that year, specifically set forththat the debt should not be cancelled or reduced.Under my constitutional power,  and in accordance withthe terms of the policy which I have set forth, I canentertain representations of the British Government con-cerning the entire debt settlement and the BritishGovernment has requested that such opportunity be afforded.I have, therefore, suggested to them that such represent-ations be made in Washington in July.     As a matter of  in-formation to the American public, I want- to make itclear that the Economic Conference now being held minister.
Lenden does not include in its programme any considerationof the debts owed by various governments to the UnitedStates.      The American delegates have been instructed notto discuss debts with the representatives of any of the debtor governments.      This is in accordance with thefurther principle that I have felt important, that the debts be considered on their merits and separate fromother international economic questions.I have further informed the British Governmentthat such representations and suggestions as may be madeto me by the British represeiitatives when they discuss theproblem in Washington will be submitted to the Congressfor information and consideration when the Congress nextmeet s.

The President sent note and statement to me by the hand of Moley, who was charged to make a last and urgent appealto you in regard to the figure.     The President is sure that public Opinion here will strongly resent acceptance of so small a sum as five millions and that the effect in Congresswhich may well be in session still tomorrow is to be feared.It was made clear that if ten millions were offered,payment in silver would be regarded as natural and un-exceptionable.2. Please let me know by telephone tomorrow morning thefinal decision as to the sum.
