HB BRITISHAB DEBT with? UNITEDTATES OPpERlOA.(previous reference:Cabinet 33(33), Con-clusion 2 .)1. The Cabinet were informed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer that the position at the momentregarding the question of the American Debt was veryobscure and that he had been unable to extract any definite or reliable information as to the intentions of President Roosevelt.    It seemed very probablethat the latter had not yet made up his mind as towhat course he would pursue.   While there were anynumber of rumours, we were as much in the dark as wehad been a month ago.    In the Chancellor&apos;s opinion the possibility of our being placed, in the positionof either having to pay the June instalment in fullor to default was very remote.   He felt sure that president Roosevelt was bound to take some action,but what that action would be and when it would betaken the Chancellor was unable to say.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington remained&apos;, -however, .    of   opinion that all would be right onthe day.    Sir Ronald Lindsay thought that president roosevelt intended to keep Congress in the dark untilthe eleventh hour and then to send them an &quot;informativemessage&apos;telling them what he proposed to do, without-asking for their advice or approval.On the whole, the Chancellor thotight that president Roosevelt was likely to make an offer,and, in doing so, to distinguish in our favourbetween the offer to us and the offer to Prance.This need not complicate the situation, as it was clear that Prance had no intention of paying in anycase.    It was possible that the President might askfor a &quot;token&quot; payment, and he (the Chancellor) had that morning received from the Prime Minister thedraft o-? a message which the Prime Minister proposedto send to the President arguing against any token-1-
payment.    Our policy at the moment should be tocontinue to press the President for a completemoratorium.In the absence, however, of anything definite,the Chancellor was not in a position to advise theCabinet as to the course to be adopted.     It waspossible that a message might be received from washington in the next 48 hours, or next week, inwhich case a Meeting of the Cabinet would be necessary.General agreement was expressed with, the viewthat any token payment on account of the debt shouldbe deprecated.The Cabinet took note that a further meeting of the Cabinet might have tobe summoned at short notice in theevent of a message being received from president Roosevelt on the AmericanDebt question.
AUSTRALIA-. 2. With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin,  the Cabinet were informed by the finances of.        Chancellor of the Exchequer that the position inregard to certain financial questions concerning theGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and various(previous reference: Australian States had undergone a change for theCabinet 32(33), better as the result of recent international financialConclusion 3),developments.      In the circumstances thb Australianswere now prepared, to wait indefinitely before engaging in any important long term conversion operations.It had, however, been found possible as a specialconcession to arrange for a Commonwealth of Australiashort-term Issue for the purpose of convertingcertain Australian 6-g- Per Cent. Loans.    this concession had been gratefully accepted by the australians, and it was now very unlikely that the grave possibilities indicated to the Cabinet on theprevious occasion would have to be faced.The Cabinet took note of this communication.
13911reduction and limitation of armaments*. * . 9F.R.The DisarmamentConference.Policy of theUnited kingdom delegation.(previousReferenceCabinet36 (33)Conclusion 6)S The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum (Paper CP. 150 (33)) by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, covering GenevaTelegrams Nos. 265, 268, 273, 275, 282 and 283,recently received from the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State.It was stated in this Memorandum that thesituation at Geneva had developed in the last fewdays into an exceedingly critical one, that theSecond Reading of Parts I and II of the DraftConvention was to be taken this week in the hopeof completing the Second Reading by the 11th June,that voting would take place on every issue in dispute, and that Ehe immediate decisions of theCabinet were required on four matters of highpolitical importance, viz:  (l) Supervision,(2) Tanks, (3) Air, and (4) No Resort to ForceDeclaration.Supervision.Mr. Eden&apos;s telegram No. 265 of May 26th.made it clear that there was little chance of a successful Disarmament Convention emerging unless a satisfactory form of supervision could be agreedupon.     Both the French and the Americans demandeda more stringent form of control than is contero-plated in Article 72 of the draft Convention, which,in effect,provided that the Permanent disarmament commission by a large majority can authorise suchinspections when it had been formally requested.In the view of the Secretary of State it was vital to discover at once from the French, how far itw;ould be necessary to go to satisfy them, and the-4-
key to the problem appeared to him to he agreement onthe establishment of regular routine inspections of armament - a plan which in practice might prove lessonerous and more formal than the Article 72 plan.     he asked for authority that this proposal should be examined by us along with the French, Americans and ethers,without prejudice, on the understanding that it couldnot be agreed to without Cabinet confirmation*Tanks. It was now necessary to state our requirements in regard to numbers of tanks, and the number to beallowed in the case of Germany, whether as &quot;samples&quot; orotherwise, under the White Paper equality ef treatmentprinciple.     The latter proposal will be strongly opposed by the French, and rather less strongly by the americans, but there is little prospect of Germanyagreeing to any Convention unless she gets some(satisfaction in this respect.Air. Mr. Eden&apos;s Telegram No. 282 of the 30th Maysuggested a formula in substitution for that contained inArticle 35 of the draft Convention.     The Secretary ofState thought that this formula went beyond what hadbeen accepted by the Cabinet, and he suggested that inthe last resort, we might agree to the following, whichretained    the gist of that Article j -&quot;The High Contracting Parties accept from&quot;now the principle of total abolition of&quot;military and naval aviation subject to&quot;the effective supervision of civil&quot;aviation to prevent its misuse for&quot;military purposes.     The Permanent&quot;Disarmament Commission shall immediately&quot;devote itself to the working out of the&quot;best possible scheme with this in view.&quot;
No Resort Mr. Eden&apos;s Telegram No. 273 of the 27th may to ForceDeclaration.    pointed out that a demand is sure to he made forextension of this declaration to all States, including those outside Europe, and that in view of president roosevelt&apos;s message and the proposition of thePolitical Commission, we shall have great difficultyin opposing the extension of the declaration to non-European States.The Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum recalledthe conclusions reached against any such extension bythe Ministerial Committee on the 17th February last(D.C.(M)(38) Sth Conclusions),  and while agreeing thatin view of our world-wide responsibility it would heextremely difficult for us to accept any generalrestriction of the kind contemplated without making itimpossible effectively to protect the territories under our control, the Secretary of State asked whatarguments should be publicly adopted which would avoidunpleasant criticism and a sense of divergence betweenPresident Roosevelt&apos;s policy and our own.The Cabinet discussed in turn each of the fourmatters raised in C.P.-150 (33).SUPERVISION.Emphasis was laid on the considerations referredto in Para.l of the Memorandum, headed &quot;Supervision&quot;.The question was, should our representative at Genevaadhere strictly to the policy laid down in Article 72of the Draft Disarmament Convention, or should he begiven some discretion to discuss the whole question with other Delegations, on the understanding that theultimate decision as to the policy of the United Kingdom i must rest with the Cabinet?
It was suggested that before agreeing to enterinto any such discussions we ought to find out how far the Americans and the French were prepared to go inthe direction of a system of regular routine inspection of armaments.    It was also pointed out that the issuenow raised was one which had been under discussion forthree years and that the policy laid down in Article72 was that favoured by the Labour Government in 1930,adopted by the present Government in 1932, and confirmed as recently as the 23rd January last by the ministerial Cabinet Committee (D.C.(M) (32) 7th Con-clusions).    It was suggested that in this matter we might, well resign the leading part to the Americansor to the French, and to place upon them the onus ofsaying whether they would be prepared to open theirarsenals and fortresses to unlimited inspection bythe Japanese and the Germans respectively.The Cabinet were reminded that the service departments were fundamentally opposed in principle to any suggestion that there should be regular rotitineinspections of armaments.   Under any such system weshould have to expose to the world our grave shortageof war supplies, and we should have to spend many millions in correcting the position in this and other respects.Attention was also drawn to the serious difficul-ties involved in inspection,as suggested, of privatefactories in this country, and to the impossibility of passing the legislation which would be necessaryin the absence of any compulsory powers.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  That the answer to the enquiry in telegram No. 265 relative toSupervision should be on thefollov/ing lines:-
&quot;We see no reason on merits to departfrom the policy laid down in Article72 of the Draft Disarmament Convention.We cannot express an opinion on analternative proposal until we knowprecisely what it means, and how itis to be carried out.    Our plan isclear and complete.   Any alternativeought to be equally clearly formulated by its authors before it can bediscussed&quot;.TANKS .The Cabinet were reminded that it would probablybe necessary next week for our representative to hand in the United Kingdom figure for Tanks .   TheGerman Delegate wished, before putting in the Germanfigure, to discuss the matter with us . . Under theprinciple of equality of treatment, Germany waslogically entitled to possess some Tanks.    If, however,we adopted this position we should be subject to acutecriticism, both at Geneva and at home, as supporting the re-armament of Germany.    On the other hand, was it possible to agree that Germany should have no tanks and the United Kingdom a very large number?It was suggested that, as in the case of supervision, so in this case of the German claim forTanks we should leave the discussion to the Germans,the French and the Americans, and if there seemed any prospect of agreement we should use all our influence to bring an agreement about.    So far as the require-men ts of the United Kingdom were concerned, it waseasy to answer any criticism.    Our Tanks were merelya substitute for a conscript army,mhe Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note that the Secretary ofState for War would furnish theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs as soon as possible with thefigure of H.M,Government&apos; s requirements in regard to the number of Tanks tobe entered under Article 21 of thedraft Convention:
(b) That in regard, to Tanks for Germany*       our representative at Geneva should,so far as possible, leave the dis-cus sion of this question to theGerman, French and American Delega-tions .AIR.The Cabinet were reminded, of the suggestionthat in the last resort we might propose the substi-tution of the following formula for paragraph (a) ofArticle 35 in the draft Convention:-&quot;The High Contracting Parties acceptfrom now the principle of total abolition of military and navalaviation subject to the effectivesupervision of civil aviation toprevent its misuse for military purposes.   The Permanent disarmament commission shall immediately devoteitself to the working out of thebest possible scheme with this inview&quot;.It was pointed out that the Air Ministry tookobjection to the -formula contained in Geneva mele-gram No, 8^3*X  and. that they hoped that the Cabinet wouldrefrain, in the absence at Geneva of the Secretaryof State for Air, from reaching any conclusion inregard, to this matter.The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that his Military Adviser took the same view,as the Air Ministry on  liit sub ject ^/so//ee h-onfl/r?^c(j-///?/&apos;rr our own lerr/toryIn this connection reference was made to atelegram just received from Geneva stating that the iraqi Delegate was likely to desert us in regard, topolicethe question of/ bombing from the air.    attention was d.rawrn to the inefficient and unsatisfactory stateof the Iraqi army, which made it all the more necessary for us to maintain without reservationsthe view that the preservation of order in Iraqwas our responsibility.The Cabinet agreed  
NO RESORT TO FORCE DECLARATION.After a brief discussion, in the course of whichthe Cabinet were reminded of the Conclusion reached by the Ministerial Cabinet Committee at their meetingon February 17th last  (D.C.(m)   (32) 8th Conclusions),namely:-&quot;That the Declaration of No Resort to force was meant specifically to applyto Europe and had been framed witha particular end in view, to extend its application universally would beto destroy the entire usefulness ofthis Pact, and any attempt to do soshould be strongly resisted by us&quot;,the Cabinet agreed  (i) That the reply to telegram No.273should be to the effect that theCabinet were not prepared tc modify the policy in regard t.o the No resort to Force declaration siet out above:(i) That in reply to telegram No .275it should be stated that the cabinet are not prepared to modify thepolicy in regard to Air armamentsset out in Article 35 of the DraftConvention:(II) That the Under Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should be invitedto confer with the Secretary of Statefor Air on the formula contained inthe Air paragraph on pages 3 &amp; 4 ofC .P.-150 (35).After the Cabinet had reached the above Conclu-sion the following message was received from thePrime Minister in regard to telegram No.283r-&quot;This is most binding and will tieus badly *    In 1936 we shall not really be free to examine proposals in practical details   We shall bemorally bound.   Why not take the wording of our own declaration withall its safeguarding provisions?&quot;On being informed of the revis ed formula on pages 3 &amp; 4of O.P.-150 (33) the Prime Minister thought that thistoo changed undesirably the emphasis of our previousdeclaration, and that we should stand by our attitude that only minor changes in our draft Convention couldbe allowed.
(il) To take note that the Secretaryof State for Foreign affairs proposed to communicate withthe members of the ministerial committee on the questions raised in further telegrams(Nos.286 and 287) from Mr Edenwhich had just been received.
IL PROPOSED&quot;Wr-POWERJgREBMBNT FORI MUTUAL CO-* OPERATION.IpreviousI Reference:Cabinet37 (33)Conclusion 2)4. The Cabinet were informed by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs that it was probablethat this Agreement would be initialled in Romebefore the end of the week.      In its latest form theAgreement was less contentious and more anodynethan in the form originally drafted.    He thought thatthe Agreement represented a distinct advance, and itwas satisfactory that France had accepted it.The objections of the Little Entente had been overcome,and the Agreement now amounted to an arrangement between the four great Western Powers for thesettlement of controversies by peaceable methodsduring the next 10 years.     As soon as the agreement was initialled it was proposed to publish it in theform of a White Paper.
t&amp; OBLIGATIONSHP GERMANY UNDERIarT V OP THEIkeaty OPbrsailjjss.5. The Cabinet had before them a Note(Paper No. CP. 149 (33)) by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, covering a memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office on the measureswhich can be taken to compel observance byGermany of her obligations under Part V(Military,Naval and Air Clauses) of the Treatyof Versailles.The Cabinet took note of this document   which had been circulated for their information.
POLICY of japan.... *Eft.6. The Cabinet had before them a Note (paper No.CP. 145 (35)) by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs covering a Memorandum by His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Tokio on the internal position and external ambitionsof Japan.     Sir Francis Lindley&apos;s views may be summarisedas follows -Japan&apos;s internal political situation may beconsidered as reasonably stable when existing world conditions are taken into account, and her financialposition cannot be described as critical.     Japan has noforeign aspirations outside Asia, and for the time beingthese do not extend further than Manchuria, with regard towhich, however, nothing short of armed force will induceher to forego her supremacy in that country.     Economically,the Chinese market is of far greater importance to herthan to any other foreign country, and it is not too muchto say that that market is of vital necessity to japan and that she will not allow it to be closed against herwithout a struggle.Japan left the League of Nations with genuineregret.   Her relations with the United States can only be described as thoroughly bad, but while the generalpopulation regard America as the enemy, the Japanese Armyconcentrates its whole attention on a future war withRussia as the only means of safeguarding the newlyacquired territory of Manchukuo, and of Japan itself,against attack by aircraft.As regards disarmament, Japan will agree to nomodifications which will impair her supremacy by land orsea in the Far East,     Subject to this, it is not impossible that she might consent to some measure of disarmament.The Cabinet took note of Hi;Majesty&apos; c? Ambassador&apos; sinteresting appreciation ofthe Japanese situation.
mWE MONETARY 7,   In. pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inM) ECONOMICCONFERENCE. the margin, the Cabinet had before them a Report..... of the Committee on the Monetary and EconomicConference (CP. 144 (33))  covering Appendix &apos;B* gThe Govern-   -departments Policy draft Resolutions in the form agreed by the Committee,at.The Committee recommended the Cabinet to approve the draft Resolutions as the basis of the policy to(previous &quot;be pursued by the United Kingdom Delegation at the reference:Cabinet Conference in regard to the Monetary and Commercial36 (33),Conclusion 7).    Headings named on the draft Agenda.The Cabinet were informed that the PrimeMinister, to whom an advance copy of the draft resolutions had been sent, had made certain commentsand suggested a number of amendments in the draft.The Cabinet agreed : -(1) To invite the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries, toconfer in regard to the various suggestions made by the Prime Minister.(2) Subject to (l) above, to approve theResolutions in the form of the draftset out in Appendix &apos;Bf to Paper No,CP. 144 (33) as the basis of thepolicy to he pursued by the UnitedKingdom Delegation at the monetary and Economic Conference in regard tothe Monetary and Commercial Headingsnamed on the draft Agenda.(NOTE: After the Meeting of the Cabinet the. Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke tothe Prims Minister on the telephone,-  and it was agreed that the consider-ation of the Prime Minister&apos;s amendmentsshould be deferred until after his return, to London, when they could bediscussed at a meeting of the UnitedKingdom Delegates at the Conference.Until the Prime Minister has conferred with his colleagues it will not bepossible to circulate copies of theResolutions in their finally approvedform.)
REPORT OP THECOMMITTEE ONECONOMIC CON-SULTATION ANDCO-OPERATION.* * *The ottawa conference... *(previous reference:Cabinet 64(32) ,Conclusion 16).H.P.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(CP. 141(33)) by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs covering the Report of the Committee onEconomic Consultation and Co-operation which wasappointed as a result of the Ottawa Conference, 1932.As explained in this Memorandum the Reportcontains no proposals for setting up a comprehensiveform of machinery for consultation upon economic questions of common interest to the various parts ofthe Empire.     While the representatives on theCommittee of the United Kingdom, Australia, New-Zealand, India and the Colonies favoured close co-operation and the establishment of some form of central body, the representatives of Canada, SouthAfrica and the Irish Free State were opposed to any form of central body and would only agree to alimited degree of co-operation.     As it seemed certainthat in this matter the three Dominion governments would adhere to their settled policy the UnitedKingdom representatives concentrated   on obtaining a Report representing what was agreed upon and notwhat was the subject of disagreement.     Among the agreed proposals of importance were those for anenlargement of the functions of the Executive Councilof the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux and of theImperial Economic Committee.The Memorandum then discussed the question ofthe attitude of the United Kingdom Government both to the Empire Marketing Board and to the maintenance,cessation or transfer of its activities in detail,and in paragraph 18,while regretting the ,&apos;disappear-ance of the Board,the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs stated that he saw no alternative but to arrangefor the Board as now constituted, to come to an end on-16-
30th September, 1933.      If the Committee&apos;s report is adopted by the Empire Governments he proposed toarrange for the necessary steps to he taken, for thosefunctions of the Board whose continuance is recommended to he transferred as from 1st October, 1933, to the -Imperial Economic Committee and for the work of winding up the remainder of the Board&apos;s activities to be putin hand.The Memorandum, after referring on the otherexisting inter-Imperial agencies, such as the imperial institute and to the publication of the Committee&apos;sReport, stated that the immediate questions on whicha decision is required are :-(1) YiThether arrangements are to be madefor the Empire Marketing Board as atpresent constituted to come to an endon 30th September, 1933.(2) Whether, if the Governments of theEmpire adopt the Committee&apos;s Report,the functions of the Empire MarketingBoard, whose continuance is recommendedare to be transferred as from 1st October,1933, to the Imperial Economic Committeeand steps taken for the remainder ofthe Board&apos;s activities to be wound up,and concluded with proposals for inter-departmentalexamination of certain questions relating to the empire marketing Board and the other agencies covered by theReport.In the course of discussion, attention was drawn to the desirability of discussing with Representativesof the Dominions who would be present at the monetary and Economic Conference, the extent to which theDominions might be prepared to hasten the plan of future co-operation indicated in paragraph 13 of theMemorandum.The Cabinet were also informed that arrangements were under consideration for- utilising the services of
the Secretary of the Empire Marketing Board and his staff after the Board&apos;s activities came to an end.General agreement was expressed with thefollowing proposals contained in the Secretary of State&apos;sMemorandum (CP. 141 (33)):-(l) that arrangements should he made forthe Empire Marketing Board as atpresent constituted to come to an endon 30th September, 1933.(3) that, if the Governments of the Empireadopt the Committee&apos;s Report, thefunctions of the Empire MarketingBoard, whose continuance is recommended,should he transferred as from 1stOctober, 1933, to the Imperial EconomicCommittee, and that steps should betaken for the remainder of the Board&apos;activities to be wound up.(3)  that the United Kingdom Departmentsmore especially concerned -(a) should examine the provision now made from the Empire MarketingFund for the services which willbe discontinued, with a view tosuch action, in consultation withthe Treasury, as may seem desirable in regard to them:(b) should consider to what extent the recommendations, apart fromthose relating to the empire marketing Board, should be carried into effect so far as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United kingdom are concerned.Before, however, reaching any final conclusions -the Cabinet agreed :-(1) That the Secretary of State&apos;sMemorandum (CP. 141 (33))&apos;shouldbe referred for examination andreport to a Cabinet Committeeconstituted as followsc - -   nj*      The Chancellor of the Exchequers.fS.frOom,m*nfiff*,TS -ffie secretary of State for the colonies the Secretary of State for scotland the President of the Board of trade the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,,(S) That a representative of theDepartment of Scientific and industrial research should be available for consultation with the Committee as required.
TAXATION 9 . The Cabinet had before them a memorandum in KENYA.(Paper No. CP. 148 (33)) by the Secretary of State for... *the Colonies, on the situation in Kenya in regard to theimposition of further taxation on the non-nativecommunity.     After recalling the adoption of Lord Moyne&apos;s(previous advice as to the necessity of increased taxation to reference:Cabinet balance the Budget, and that an income tax would be the35 (32)Conclusion fairest method of increasing the non-native contribution4).to revenue, and drawing attention to the intenseopposition in Kenya to income tax in principle, theMemorandum explained the circumstances in which thefollowing alternative practicable proposals for raisingrevenue had been submitted to the Secretary of State :-A graduated non-native Poll Tax, based on income;An extension of the system of Trade Licences;A Landing Tax on Passengers;A Package Tax;An increased Tax on the registration of companies(l per cent, on nominal capital);    and increased stamp duties on Bills and PromissoryNotes.Among other advantages the alternative proposals would produce some greatly needed revenue in the current)year, and revenue from them would be found with the co-operation of the unofficials, while income tax wouldcertainly be obstructed.It was also urged that if the alternative proposals are adopted and income tax is dropped, one ofthree things will happen.     Either the alternatives willwork and produce the necessary revenue and the tax payerswill be satisfied with them, in which case the situation will be satisfactory;    or they will fail to produce anadequate revenue;    or, while producing revenue, they willbe found to be unpopular in practice, with the result thatthe tax-payers will ask for a system of taxation more
justly and scientifically adapted to capacity to pay.    In either of the last two events the Income Tax Bill, which is already indraft and has received detailed examination, can he imposed witha larger measure of acceptance.Attached to the Memorandum were telegrams which had recently passed between the Secretary of State and the Governor,who was opposed to the above proposal and favoured the enactment of the Income Tax Ordinance for the reasons set out in his telegrams .The Secretary of State for India enquired whether indians in Kenya would not be more heavily taxed under the alternative proposals than under the Income Tax proposal.   He would like, ifpossible, before action was taken, to inform the Government ofIndia of what was proposed, but he did not ask that the policysuggested in CP. 14S (33) should be modified^ even if the Govern-ment of India raised objections to it.The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed that underactually f ry?nor$ if? fayesthe alternative proposals Indians in Kenya would-fc&amp;jge^? than under the Income Tax proposal.
