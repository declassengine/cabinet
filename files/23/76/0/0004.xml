CABINETPROCEDUREProbableDate of next Meet-ing-1. The Lord President of the Cotincil said thathe had summoned the Cabinet in order to clear awayany   outstanding questions of detail before thePrime ministers arrival from Washington.   He thoughtthat the Prime Minister would in all probabilityfix a Meeting of the Cabinet at an early date totell his colleagues the results of his visit to washington.CO-operative societies.Propos edTaxationof.(Pre\rlousReference:Cabinet 31(33), Con-elusion 5.)(NOTE: After the Cabinet had risen, theChancellor of the Exchequerinformed the Secretary that hewould be glad if the PrimeMinister would agree to holda Meeting of the Cabinet onFriday, May 5th, at 11 a,m.to consider the question ofCo-operative Societies.)
THE TARIFFTRUCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(31), Con-elusion 3,)2. The Lord President of the Council informed theCabinet that he had received from the Foreign Secretary(who was absent indisposed) a Memorandum on theAmerican proposals for a Tariff truce, on which heand the Foreign Secretary had had some conversation.He thought, however, that the question was so bound up with the subjects of the Prime Minister&apos;s recentMission that it would be better, particularly in theabsence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,to defer its consideration until after the PrimeMinister&apos;s return.
AUSTRALIA.Finances of.F R.3.   The Chancellor of the Excheqxier made astatement to the Cabinet on discussions he had had with the Right Hon. Stanley Bruce on certainfinancial questions interesting the Government ofthe Commonwealth of Australia and various AustralianStates ..A summary of this discussion is on record on the standard file ofCabinet Minutes in the Secretary&apos;scustody, and copies have beentransmitted to Ministers closelycone concerned.The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows  The Lord President of the Council(in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for theColonies ,The President of the Board of Trade  should be formed, to assist theChancellor of the Exchequer on thesubject of his discussions withMr Bruce.
THE -JUDICIAL 4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by  theVACANCYLord Chancellor (CP.-117 (33)) on the subject of the(Previous judicial vacancy caused by the death of Mr JusticeReference: d JCabinet 9 McCardie on April 26th.   The Memorandum reviewed the(32), Con-clusion 9.)        state of business in the Royal Courts of Justice,3bbblt)lo       since, for the filling of the present vacancy, an address would have to be moved in both Houses ofParliament for the appointment of a Judge in theKingTs Bench Division, and stressed the imperativenecessity of maintaining the number of Judges as itwas prior to April 26th.The Lord Chancellor gave the Cabinet furtherstatistics of the state of business in the Courts,emphasising the necessity for filling the judicialvacancy created by the death of Mr Justice McCardie.In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer he explainedthat for technical reasons no assistance could beobtained from the Chancery Division of the RoyalCourts of Justice on a scale sufficient to render his proposal unnecessary.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposal of the LordChancellor as set forth in his Memo-randum CP.-117 (33) and summarised above, and that a Resolution shouldbe introduced in both Houses ofParliament on Tuesday next, May 9th.(The Secretary of State for Indialeft the Meeting at this point.)
PRODUCEMARKETSSITUATION,(Pr previous reference:Cabinet 13(33), Con-conclusion ion 2 .)5. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-115(33)) containing a review of the general producesituation, including meat, dairy produce, cereals,sugar, horticultural products, hops and fish.   Thedecisions desired by the Minister related to milk products (see below, Conclusion (a))and fish policy.The essential features of the fish policy, agreed toby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Presidentof the Board of Trade, were stated in the memorandum as follows:-&quot;Restriction of foreign imports of fishin conjunction with a greater restric-tion of British-caught fish, attained by -(a) regulation of the mesh of nets topermit the escape of under-sizedfish, coupled with the impositionof size limits below which fishmay not be landed or sold inGreat Britain:    these measures are designed to combat thedestruction of immature fish,which has been a growring evilfor some years past;    and(b) the prohibition of the landing and sale in Great Britain during the summer months of fish taken fromdistant regions, such as BearIsland.The policy will require legislation and an early statement on the subject is desirable&quot;.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries made astatement to the Cabinet in elaboration of his memorandum,In reply to   , questions from colleagues he saidthat the Argentine Agreement made impossible anyimposition of a tariff on beef during the next fewyears.   He was not satisfied as to the beef situationand outlook, but, as the result of consultation between himself and the President of the Board of
TariffTruce.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(33), Con-clusion 2.)Trade, the Argentine Delegation had been warned that if prices of beef remained unremunerative weshould have to exercise the right provided for in theAgreement to call a Conference of the Dominions andcountries concerned, with a view to further restric-tions.    Further, the quota of imported beef for the summer had been raised to a comparatively high level in order that it might be restricted in theautumn when British supplies were normally put onthe market.   Also in reply to a question, he gavesome details as to a possible project for utilisingsurplus stocks of milk in this country.As this would involve expenditure from, public funds and it had not been disciissed with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Cabinet did not discuss the project in detail.The Minister was asked, if he wished to pursue tieproposals, to discuss them in the first instancewith the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Both the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland laid stress on the importance o-f not carrying through theproposed tariff truce until a decision had beenreached as to the imposition of a tariff on importedoats, which was now under consideration by theImport Duties Advisory Committee.The Cabinet approved the following proposals ofthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries:-(a) Milk Products .   That authority should be given to the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries, inconjunction with the Ministers atthe head of other Departmentsconcerned, to open negotiationswith supply countries with a viewto arranging for a considerablerestriction of imports of milk products into this country:

He feared,however, that in this case a solution would be difficult.The matter arose out of the financial position inAustralia and proposals for the conversion of certainAustralian Loans.   These were chiefly State Loans, butthe Commonwealth was responsible.   For some time therehad been a feeling in Australia that after we hadwere being converted our own Loans they setss&amp;^x&amp;B badly treated bythe bondholders who insisted on the maintenance of thepresent high rates of interest.     The proper procedure&apos;...&apos;&apos;,of the Commonwealth Government in these circumstances would, be to go to the Bank of England and arrange for theissr?e of new Loans and for their under-writing.

He was being attacked by the Opposition in theCommonwealth Parliament, who claimed that he was not doinghis best for Australian interests, and naturally, there-fore, he was anxious to get some striking success,   TheGovernor of the Bank of England had told Mr Bruce thathe was prepared to deal with some  84,000;00G of Loansspread over two years;   he could not, however, under-writ emore of them at one time than  15,000,000, and proposed towork them off by taking them In blocks&apos;at intervals.By these means the Governor of the Bank thought it mightbe possible, in the period named, to convert the-584,000,000.

He feared,however, that in this case a solution would be difficult.The matter arose out of the financial position inAustralia and proposals for the conversion of certainAustralian Loans.   These were chiefly State Loans, butthe Commonwealth was responsible.   For some time therehad. been a feeling in Australia that after we hadwere being converted our own Loans they *8h3l^x1sr badly treated bythe bondholders who Insisted on the maintenance of thepresent high rates of interest.     The proper procedure of the Commonwealth Government in these circumstances would be to po to the Bank of England and arrange for feeissue of new Loans and for their under-writing.   Mr Brucewas present, in London mainly for the conversion of these loans.   He was being attacked by the Opposition in theCommonwealth Parliament, who claimed that he was not doinghis best for Australian interests, and naturally, there-fore, he was anxious to get some striking success.   TheGovernor of the Bank of England had told Mr Bruce thathe was prepared to deal with some  84,000,000 of Loansspread over two years;   he could not, however, under-writemore of them at one time than  15,000,000, and proposed towork them off by taking them in blocks at intervals.By these means the Governor of the Bank thought it mightbe possible, in the period named, to convert the. 84,000,000.   Mr Bruce had replied that this was not a
proposal which his Government could entertain.   Publicopinion in Atistralia was vfry strongly moved, and evenexplosive;    consequently he wanted some much more rapidscheme of conversion.   After conversations in the CityMr Bruce had come to see the Chancellor ef the Exchequer.He had shown himself anxious a fes about the future positionin Australia, and had not concealed his belief that australia might default on her Loans unless the  84,000,000at once.could be dealt withy   He had agreed that it was fantasticto try and, convert 00 large a sum unless the BritishGovernment &quot;could come in&quot;.   When pressed, Mr Bruce had explained that by this phrase he meant &quot;guarantee theLoan&quot;.   The Chancellor had replied that Mr Bruce mustput this idea out of his head at once.    It would require legislation, and he himself, as Chancellor of the Exchequer,could not for a moment contemplate introducing it.   Re had further pointed out that what Mr Bruce told him of theattitude in Australia indicated a very wild state of mind,as a default would deal a disastrous blow at Australiancredit, and had advised him to adopt the Governor of theBank*s proposal for cleaning up the situation within areasonable period.   He had said that if Mr Bruce could not accept that proposal he himself was willing to discuss thematter with the Governor of the Bank of England. Mr Bruce,in the course of their conversation, had produced longtelegrams from Australia, to show the strength of feeling,resentment and impatience at delay that was felt there.Prom their discussions three propositions had emerged.The first was to deal with  36,000,000, which wasto include all the 6^% Stock and  15,000,000 of 6% Stock.The Chancellor had said that if that was attempted, itwould probably be necessary to make special arrangements,as not more than  15,000,000 could be under-written at onetime.    Although he had not said this to Mr Brtice, it would
in fact be possible for the Government here to aid inrespect of the remaining  11,000,000 without- legislation.Also this might be followed by a second arrangement to clear away the remainder of the 6$ Stock.^he second proposition had been to deal with 43,000,000, namely, the whole of the 6^ and        Stock.It would, of course, be impossible for that amount to be under-written at one time.   Unless the United KingdomGovernment guaranteed the issue, the market could notabsorb further Loans until the  4.3,000,000 had beendigested.^he third proposition was the proposal of theAustralian Government to plant the whole of the  84,000,000on the market at one time.   They did not suggest that itcould possibly be under-written:   they simply proposedto send a circular to the bondholders proposing that thewhole favm should be converted to a 4$ basis.   This wouldbe followed by &amp; later notice stating that the responsehad been so unsatisfactory that they found themselves inthe position of being able to pay no more than 4$ in thefuture.   The Chancellor added that Mr Bruce was coming tosee him the same afternoon.   He had seen the Governor ofthe Bank, who was not willing to deal with more than 86,000,000.   Mr Bruce would ask the Chancellor to makeit possible for him to deal with  43,000,000.   1*heGovernor of the Bank took a serious view of the situationand thought that Australia would in fact be prepared todefault.    It was impossible, of course, to know how farthey were bluffing^ but in any event the possible outcomehad to be weighed.   Vhe Chancellor&apos;s own inclination wasto refuse the proposal.   He intended to Ray that he wouldbe willing to help in the matter of  36,000,000, but that even that would slow down the conversion of the balance.
If Australia acted as they proposed, the result would fall on the bondholders and Australia would have to takethe consequences, which would be very serious.   TheChancellor warned the Cabinet that beyond the  84,000,000nearlynow in qttestion there were loans of/ 500,000,000 toAustralia at lower rates mK&amp;ty&amp;$X%l^lim%xm and these would necessarily be affected by the proposed actionsince the whole credit of Australia would be ruined..He was not asking for a decision that day, and was onlytelling his colleagues for information.   As, however, theresponsibility was rather heavy for a single Minister totake, he would ask the Cabinet to appoint a small committee to assist him.THfl SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR raised thequestion of the effect of the proposals on the status of Trias tee Stock.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed outthat there was power for the United Kingdom Governmentto disallow Australian legislation affecting TrusteeStock, and the bondholders were likely to come to theGovernment to exercise that power.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that the question was affected by proposals that had been mentioned to him by the High Commissioner ofSouth Africa,   ^he South African Government did not wishto interfere with the Trustee status of Dominion Stock,to abandon the practice of sending tobut wanted/the United Kingdom Government kHxxkxK^aKxfelxKcertified copies of their Acts. This would not affect theKKXxx^xxxkxaiaxKfxSxxMxxxtkXxKffiastxJafxkkMxXSJlxIx&amp;^xialegalsxxxxBi&amp;xxxxhs^power of disallowance.   General Smuts wasin agreement with this proposal.     The Secretary ofState also referred to the difficulties which one, at anyrate, of the Agents-General of Australian States was placed in obtaining any information as to Mr Bruce&apos;sconversion proposals,
THE PRESIDENT CP THE BOARD OP TRADE informed the Cabinet that the great mass o.f Australian Loans washeld not by individuals but by large institutions.   TheInsurance Companies, for instance, held a great deal.If the Commonwealth Government carried out their proposalAustralia would never get another penny of money from theLondon market.THE SFGRETARY OP SmATB PGR DOM IN TON affairs pointed out that the financial position in New Zealandwas also serious, and the Australian proposal would reacton them.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said it would react detrimentally to all Dominions Trustee Stock.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that bothlew Zealand and South Africa could convert at once onbetter terms than Australia.   The Australians realisedthis.   He had fold Mr Bruce that he was willing to doSouth Africawhat he could to get Hew Zealand and Au^ym^m to postponetheir conversion.   He had welcomed this, but would notThe Chancelloradmit that it affected his position.   3j&amp; added that theposition had some bearing on the American situation.At, first he had understood that President Roosevelt wasterrified of a default by us, or by anyone else.   Now hewas instructing his representatives to discuss with our representatives on the basis of a Debt payment in June.An Australian default might show President Rooseveltthat in the present state of the world a default was not impossible.   He asked what was the view of the Cabinet asto the effect on the Rouse of Commons of a proposal to guarantee an Australian conversion?The view was expressed generally that theHouse of Commons would not look at such aproposal.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed outthat the Australian Government appeared to have lost allsense of proportion.
THE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought the Bank ofEngland&apos;a offer extraordinarily good from Australianspoint of view.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE saidthat the Bank of England and Messrs Nivison were the bestjudges.   He doubted if Mesrs Nivison eould under-writemore than  15,000,000.   Latterly investors in thiscountry had rather run away from Australian Loans.   Hethought, the Bank of England&apos;s offer was on the generousside.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought it was extremely generous.   The Governor of the Bank, as he had said, took a serious view of the possibility of an australian defsxi.lt, and was most anxious to avoid it.No doubt he could, exercise a good deal of inflxienee inthe City.   On merits, however, the offer was an actound-ingly good one.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs pointed out that the        Loans concerned were to Statespolitically unfavourable to Mr Bruoe.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theannual paving from the conversion of  84,000,000 would beabout  1,250,000. and from  26,000,000 about half that sum.That meant that for about  600,000 the commonwealth government was willing to jeopardise the $hole credit ofAustralia.THE SFCRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs thought that Mr Bruce ought *o be left in no doubt.He should be made to realise that Parliament would not look at a proposal to guarantee a Loan and that no memberof the Cabinet would, be willing to propose it.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said his intention was to talk very straight, to Mr Bruce that afternoon.
THE SECRETARY OP S^ATE FOR WAR pointed out thatthe bondholders, bf pressing the Government here todisallow any legislation required by Australia to oarryout their proposal, would place the Cabinet in a difficult position.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hewas much concerned at the exacerbation of Imperialopinion that would arise.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR asked if the recentassistance given to Newfoundland would not give Mr Brucea precedent?THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that inthat case money had actually been found for Newfoundlandin conjunction with Canada.   He did not think, however,that       Bruce would use it as a precedent.   He was takinghis own line.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES pointedout that the proposed Australian action would react very seriously on the Indian debates.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA agreed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed/out that it would also create great difficulties for him.owing to large Loans which had been issued in certainColonies, e.g. lenya, without the possibility of conversion.The Cabinet then took the decisionrecorded in, Cabinet 32 (33).
