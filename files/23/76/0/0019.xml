MpE monetarymo eoonomigmonference .Iff   -forthcomingParliamentaryRebate.ffpreviouspeference:cabinet 451(53), Oon-jclusion 1,)I   ^)&apos;- 1.1. The Prime Minister raised the question of who6&quot;should speak on behalf of the Government in the Debate,asked for by the Opposition next Tuesday.   TheOpposition desired to raise two pointsnamely,- thequestion of why the Conference was to be adjourned,and the recent statement at a Committee of theConference by the President of the Board of trade on the subject of Public Works ,The discussion showed that there were a number of difficulties involved in this proposal.   The questionof the adjournment of the Conference would have to betaken on the Foreign Office Vote, while the&quot; questionof public works would most conveniently be taken onthe Ministry of Health Vote.   The two questions,however, were felt to be inextricably connected one with the other.   To take them on separate Votes wouldbe inconvenient.   Moreover, it was virtually impossiblefor the appropriate Ministers to be present at the debate on Tuesday.   There was to be a very importantmeeting of the Bureau of the Conference on Tuesdayafternoon at 5.30, at which both the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer would have to be present.   The date of the Bureau meeting could not be changed as it had been fixed at the latest possible moment in order to meet the convenience of M, Hymans,the Belgian Foreign Minister, and S. Jung, the ItalianFinance Minister, who would be arriving in london that day.   mhe President of the Board of Trade wouldbe in attendance on the King at Southampton that day and could not take part in the Debate.(At this point the Prime Minister sent for the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury, and during this intervalitems 2    and   3       were discussed.)The&apos; Prime Minister explained the situation to theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and asked him
to take the matter up with the Opposition Whips,emphasising in doing so the difficulty of altering the time of the meeting of the Bureau.   He was askedto try and arrange that the Debate should take placeon Wednesday, July 2.6th, instead of Tuesday the 25th.
m RUBBERifusrrRY111.jjipevious[reference:Cabinet 20Is), Con&quot;i conclusion 4.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-182 (33))recalling that at the Meeting mentioned in the marginhis colleagues had agreed to the introduction of the rubber Industry Bill in the House of Lords as aGovernment measure.   The Bill, which provided for theimposition of a levy on all raw rubber used in manu-facture in the United Kingdom in order to afford funds for the Research Association of British Rubber Manu-faeturers, had passed through that House without serious opposition, but differences of opinion had since arisenamong the rubber manufacturers who formerly stipportedthe Bill, with the result that many of the largermanufacturers had become opponents of the proposalfor a compulsory levy.   The present supporters of theBill (the smaller manufacturers) had recently passed a Resolution urging the Government to bring the bill before the House of Commons, possibly in the hope thatthe Bill might be considered and submitted to the free vote of the House, when the position of the smallermanufacturers could be ventilated.   They had also discussed the possibility of making some arrangement for the support of the Research Association by voluntary contributions from manufacturers, and had promised to increase their individual subscriptions.In these circumstances the Department of scientific and Industrial Research were considering whether further State assistance could be recommended on special terms, subject to Treasury approval, to secuiethe continuance of the Research Association during thenext five years.   In these Conditions the Presidentthought that the only course would be to announce that the Government did not intend to proceed withthe Bill in the House of Commons .   He proposed to do
this in answer to a Parliamentary Question, explaining the reasons and adding that efforts were being made tocontinue the work of the Research Association by meansof voluntary subscriptions.The Cabinet agreed  That the President of the Board of^rade should be authorised to announce that the Government did not intend toproceed in the House of Commons withthe Rubber Industry Bill.
ST INDIES. 3, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (C .P.-171(33)) covering the Report of the Closer UnionCommission on their visit to the Leeward Islands,the Windward Islands and Trinidad.   After the Commis-sion had spent some time in the West Indies it became clear that public opinion in Trinidad was so opposedto any form of closer political union with thenorthern Islands that it would be useless to try to devise any form of Federation which should includeTrinidad as well as the Leeward and Windward Islands.They had accordingly set themselves to considerwhether there was any system which they could recom-mend for the latter two groups, and they had evolveda series of proposals for this purpose.   Theseproposals, howrever (a summary of which was attached as an Appendix to the Memorandum), the Commissionersthemselves regarded as nothing more than a first step  and that a tentative one - towards a real Federa-tion, not only of the Islands with which they weredealing, but of other units in the West Indies whichmight eventually be found willing to join.The most important proposal of the Commission wasa change in the present method by which the governor of the Colony is invested with the power of ensuring the passage of essential legislation.   At present this is effected by means of an     Official majorityenabling the Governor to use his casting vote in orderto carry or veto any measure on which the votes areevenly divided.   The Commission proposed that when theGovernor takes the view that it is necessary in thepublic interest to carry a measure decided upon byhim and the particular Executive Council but opposed by the Unofficial members of the Legislative Council,he should be empowered to make a declaration to this-5-
effect and the measure should then have the force oflaw, subject to its being approved by the Secretary ofState.   The Official majority would be abolished.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for the colonies in CP.-171 (33), including thechange in the method by which theGovernor of the Colony will be invested with the power of ensuring the passage of essential legislation.This changetwas recognised to be applicable to/West Indies, though notto African Colonies:(b) To invite the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to circulate to them a map of the West Indian Islands whichwould serve to illustrate the Report.
THE ADELPHI 4.   The Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesESTATE BILL *called the attention of the Cabinet to a discussionof the Adelphi Estate Bill on the previous day beforethe Select Committee of the House of Commons onUnopposed Bills, at which, inter alia, a decision was reported in the Press to have been taken that thedesigns of the new buildings should be submitted forthe approval of the Crown Lands Advisory Committeeinstead of the Fine Arts Commission, which would raisecertain difficulties,The question was left for decision by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries in consultation with thePrime Minister and the First Commis-sioner of Works.

The Secretary of State for the Coloniesraised as a matter of urgency in connection with item 1 of these Conclusions the position of theTariff ^ruce on the adjournment of the Monetary andEconomic Conference.    So far as the Colonies were concerned, the difficulty arose with the JapaneseGovernment, who were asking whether the measures taken to protect British trade in certain Coloniesagainst acute Japanese.competition were consistent with the Tariff Truce.   The Secretary of Statereported that he had never adhered to the TariffTruce on behalf of any of the Colonies, and, judgingfrom the precedent of an ordinary Commercial Treaty,the Colonies would not be committed unless he had soadhered,The President of the Board of Trade also raised the question of the position of the Tariff Truce fromthe point of view of the United Kingdom.    In presentconditions he could not undertake to adhere to itindefinitely.   The most satisfactory solution wouldbe if the adjournment of the Conference were to bedeemed as suspending the Tariff Truce.The Cabinet were informed that other nationsmight not raise this question, as many of them hadprotected themselves by very wide reservations to theoriginal Truce.    Our own position was also fairlycomprehensively protected in this respect.The Prime Minister recalled that at the time whenthe Tariff Truce was entered into the conditions were different from those prevailing today.    It wasthen assumed that the Conference was to be completed at a single session and. that there would be noadjournment.   Moreover, there appeared to be considerable doubts as to whether certain nations,
including the United States of America and Prance,had in practice observed the Tariff Truce.   Hethought it might be necessary for him to raise thequestion at the next meeting of the Bureau.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies eould justify theaction taken in particular colonies in respect to Japanese competitionby stating that he had not adhered to the Tariff Truce on behalf of theColonies,   He should, however, inconsultation with the President ofthe Board of Trade, assure himself that this position was covered bysatisfactory precedents from previousCommercial Treaties.   He should beauthorised to make the statementpublicly if pressed on the point:(b) That the Prime Minister and thePresident of the Board of trade should see the Head of the UnitedStates Delegation the same afternoon and discuss with him the question oftheTariff Truce and whether it hadbeen observed by the United Statesof America:fc) That the Prime Minister, if he deemeddesirable, should raise the questionof the Tariff Truce, or arrange for it to be raised, at the appropriate body of the Monetary and EconomicConference (either the Bureau or theEconomic Commission).
6,   The Cabinet continued the discussion begunon Monday, July 17th, of the Loan raised in Americain January, 1917, and the arrangements proposed inconsequence of the United states legislation abrogatingthe gold clause in contracts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer amplified his proposals by explaining that the exchange would bemade on the basis that for every /I,000 of 5^% GoldBonds the holder would receive  275 of SterlingBonds .   The Sterling Bonds would be repayable inLondon on February 1, 1937, and would bear interest at the rate of 2^% per annum, payable half-yearly inLondon on August 1st and February 1st, the firstpayment being made on February 1, 1934.    In august the payment would be made in paper dollars, but thiswould be taken into account in framing the scheme.That meant that  133:6:8 would be given for every 100.   About  10 of the  33 represented the difference in interest, and the remainder would be compensation to holders for their inability to receive payment inGold Dollars .   The amount of the Twenty Year Bondsoutstanding on March 31, 1933, was  136,333,500( 28,013,733 at par) .    If all these Bonds wereconverted to Sterling Bonds the amount of the latter to be issued would be  37,491,712.   At par theinterest payment on the Twenty Year Bonds is equivalentto  1,540,753 yearly, while the charge for interest on the Sterling Bonds would be . 937,292 (at 2\%).    It was anticipated that this offer would be generally accepted, but persons whowere unwilling to take advantage of it would getpaid in paper dollars.    In reply to questions, theChancellor of the Exchequer admitted that the amountof the Sterling Bonds to be offered in exchange for
the original Bonds was very difficult to determine.The Governor of the Bank of England had been consulted and the figure now contemplated was below that whichhe at first advised, and satisfied the Officials ofthe Treasury.In the course of the discussion it was suggestedthat the proposal would be criticised as involvingpayment by the British taxpayer of a bonus in corn-pens at ion for American legislation of doubtfulpropriety.   As soon as an announcement of our intention was issued there was likely to be a large rise in thevalue of these Bonds.   That rise would accrue to acertain extent to speculators.It was suggested that in the House of Commons itwould be said that if the Directors of a Companyacted in the manner now proposed by the&apos; Chancellor ofthe Exchequer the stockholders could bring an action for an Injunction against them.The various criticisms mentioned at the previous meeting of the Cabinet were raised, including thepossible objection of the Dominions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied to allthese points,   ^here was n0 question of legal liability to the Bondholders.    It was not even a question offinancial morality, but merely one of whether, onthe wider view, his proposal was not to our advantage.In taking the very difficult decision involved it wasnecessary always to bear in mind that we were essentially great creditor country.    In that respect our position was different from that of most nations of the world,including the Dominions.   This was a unique transactionnever likely to recur.   There was no real comparisonwith Canada, who frequently borrowed in the Americanmarket.    Our action ought not to cause any serious
embarrassment to that Dominion. These considera-tions were imponderable, but were nevertheless ofthe greatest importance.mhe question was raised as to whether, by takingthe high line in this matter, we should not raisedifficulties for ourselves later on in discussing asettlement of War Debts .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that thatdepended almost entirely on the form in which theannouncement appeared.   He had prepared a White Paper,from which he read the following extract:-&quot;Since the legislation of the countryto whose laws the contract is subject hasabrogated the gold clause in the contract,payment of interest and repayment ofprincipal under the existing Bonds canonly be made in coin or currency whichis at the date of payment legal tenderin the United States for the dischargeof debts, that is in paper dollars andnot in gold dollars .    In the very specialcircumstances which surround thisparticular case, however, His Majesty&apos;8&quot;Government propose to make an offer tothe holders of the Bonds to surrendertheir existing Bonds after encashmentof the interest coupon due on the 1stAugust, 1933, and receive in exchangenew Sterling Bonds which would be issuedsubject to the following terms andconditions&quot;.    (Here the Chancellorreferred to the conditions already mentioned above.)The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that he had -avoided the imputation that British finance wasbeing assimilated to that of the Gold Countries byfixing the offer on a purely arbitrary basis.^he President of the Board of Trade reminded the Cabinet that the abrogation of the gold clausehad hit very hard many people in this country towhom payments wrere due from America.   This was amatter which would have to be raised when thequestion of War Debt payments was discussed.In the meanwhile it was not a good thing for us todo something that we condemned America for doing,
or to take advantage of their action.   He pointed outthat, whatever action the Government took in thismatter, they would be exposed to criticism.   In his view the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposals werethe best and cheapest way out of the difficulty fromthe point of view of the interests of this country as a whole .The Cabinet agreed -(a) To accept the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer, butthe opinion was expressed that theoffer should, if possible, be on lessgenerous lines than those at present contemplated.   There was general agree-ment, however, that this technicalquestion must be left to the Chancellorof the Exchequer to decide:(b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should discuss with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury the arrange-ments for the announcement of the abovepolicy, and should have discretion asto the form it should take, including,if he thought advisable, the issue ofa White Paper.
JUDGES&apos; 7.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySALARIES. Jthe Lord Chancellor (C .P.-180 (35)) on the subjectjprevious of the validity of the cut in Judges * Salaries.   the reference:Cabinet 23        Memorandum stated that the Lord Chancellor and the(33), Con-clusion 1.)       Secretary of State for War, in accordance with thef\ decision of the Cabinet mentioned in the margin, had^%b]ill on several occasions seen Justices Macnaghten, Clausonand Luxmoore, who now said that they were willing tomake a voluntary surrender of their salaries equal in amount to the cut, but that their real grievance wasthat the action of the Government was not only uncon-stitutional but had lowered their prestige, dignity and independence.   The two Ministers had made every possible suggestion to the three Judges as to means whereby any supposed lowering   of their prestige,dignity and independence co\ild be put right, but theyhad not been able to satisfy them.   Attached to theLord Chancellor&apos;s Memorandum were a Memorandum bythe three Judges and a draft Bill which they wished. to see passed (CP.-180 (33), Appendices &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;) .After setting forth the very difficult considera-tions involved, the Lord Chancellor asked the decisionof the Cabinet on the following question, namely,whether -(l) The three Judges should be informedthat the Government were unable totake any further step in the matter:. .. or(2) The Judges should be invited to obtainthe signatures of all their colleagues,being informed at the same time thatif they did so the Government would proceed with legislation relieving the Judges from the compulsion imposed by the Act and Order in Council, andat the same time containing suchrecitals as would make it clear thatthe independence of the Judges wasunimpaired by what had been done inthe past and remained in the future as it was before the passing of the economy Act.
The Cabinet approved the second of the above alternatives, and authorised the Lord Chancellor totake action thereon in concert withthe Secretary of State for War.
IE ROYALMISSIONjj LOTTERIESjjD BETTING.Lnal Report,previous reference:Cabinet 6133), Con-conclusion   6.)8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C .P.-179 (33)) on the subject ofthe Final Report of the Royal Commission on Lotteriesand Betting, suggesting that, as the House of commons would expect to receive in the autumn some statementof the Government&apos;s intentions, a representativeCabinet Committee should be set up charged with theduty of studying the Report with a view to submittingrecommendations to the Cabinet in the autumn.   Theappointment of a Committee now would prevent parliament and the country from thinking that the Royal Commis-sion*s Report had been pigeon-holed, while theMinisters appointed.as members of the Committee might find time to give some preliminary study to it duringthe Summer Recess.   Meanwhile the Report was beingcarefully studied in the Home Office, and steps werebeing taken to ascertain the views of Chief Officersof Police on certain practical questions affectingPolice administration which were suggested by the detailed recommendations of the Royal Commission.Attached to the Memorandum was an analysis of the reception accorded to the Report by the Press.The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows:-The Home Secretary (in the Chair)The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for Air,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Minister of Transport,PfhvocJL ^The Attorney-General,The Financial Secretary to thetreasury  should study the FinaltReport of theRoyal Commission on Lotteries and betting and submit recommendations to the Cabinetin the autumn.
