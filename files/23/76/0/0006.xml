IT HE DISARMAMENTjOONPERENCE.frhe criticalIjPosition atfGeneva.j( previous reference:Cabinet 33(33), Con-clusion 4.)1.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,as a matter of urgency, reported that since thereturn of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary forForeign Affairs with instructions from the Cabinet,a critical stage had been reached in the DisarmamentConference at Geneva.    The German Delegate objectedstrongly to the standardisation of Continentalarmies, as proposed in Part II of the British DraftConvention;    the French agreed with us, as didvarious other nations, and the Americans, thoughrather less strongly.   Mr Eden had adhered closely to his instructions from the Cabinet to press for a procedure under which the Conference should take a   -Second Reading of the portion of Part II, dealingwith Effectives, before a First Reading of theremainder of that Part.   All the time the strain hadbeen increasing, and rather alarming messages werebeing received that very morning.   The parliamentary under-Secretary had seen the German Delegate, withthe approval of the Chairman of the Conference, andhad learned that the Germans now claimed that duringthe five years in which other nations were cutting down their forces and scrapping their material,Germany rrrast be allowed to build up to a position ofqualitative equality:    for example, in the Air, asthe French Air Force was brought down the Germanwould rise.   The German Ambassador had indicated tothe Secretary of State that Germany expected to proceed by stages, but this went very much further.   In his conversations the German Delegate had hinted at somepossibility of compromise; but the Foreign Secretarywarned the Cabinet that if Germany expected to have both a professional Reichswehr and a conscript forceGeneva would not accept it.    ^he Secretary of State
had informed the Parliamentary Under-Secretary thathis action up to now was quite correct, and had asked.him, if possible, to keep the discussion confined tothe question of Effectives, even to the point of taking a vote on it at the General Commission.Tn this connection he mentioned that a majority votedid not automatically bring matters to an end.   Hethought it advisable that Germany should be made to face up to the position of whether the General Commis-sion would accept the principle of standardisation or armies .   He then read a telegram from the parliamentary under-Secretary that had not yet been typewritten,inter aliaaccording to which Germany was  demanding/guns up to155 mm.:    that was to say, 100% of equality.In reply to questions the Secretary of Statedid not conceal that in the event of an adverse vote on the question of procedure it was possible thatGermany might walk out of the Conference.Some discussion took place as to the desirabilityof the Parliamentary Under-Secretary telling theChairman of the Conference and the representatives ofthe United States, Prance and Italy, of the extremecharacter of the German proposals .   notwithstanding the consternation that this was likely to produce,it was generally thought that the parliamentary under-Secretary could, hardly avoid informing them ofthe position, since otherwise they would not be ableto appreciate the risks that would be run by adopting the alternative procedure of continuing a First reading of the British Draft Convention.The Prime Minister said he hesitated to accept an offer that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had made to go back to Geneva as soon as hehad cleared up some work connected with the Organising
Committee of the Monetary and Foonomic Conference.He knew the Secretary of State was not fully restored to health, and he realised the wear and tear ofGeneva;    nevertheless, he felt it might be necessaryfor him to go to Geneva and make one of those speeches in which he was unequalled, setting out the whole position in order that the facts might be on the records of the Conference.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should instruct the Parliamentary Under-Secretary,at Geneva, to continue Mutatis Mutandis the policy agreed to atthe Meeting of the Cabinet referredto in the margin;    that is to say,to press for a procedure under whichthe Conference should take a SecondReading of the portion of Part II,dealing with Effectives, before proceeding to a First Reading ofthe remainder of that Part.     Heshould also authorise Mr Eden toinform the Chairman of the Confer-ence frankly of what had passed between him and the German Delegate.He should also Rive him discretion,if he thought fit, to tell the otherDelegates mainly concerned.   Heshould work to bring the Germansinto the open on the question ofEffectives .
THE DISARMAMENT 2 . The Cabinet had before them the Conclusions[CONFERENCE.of a Meeting of Ministers held on May 5th, in accord-j(Previous ance with the decision reached at the Meeting mentionedI Reference:i Cabinet 33 in the margin, on the subject of the policy of the] (33), Con-I elusion 6.)        United Kingdom Delegation at the Disarmament Confer-ence at Geneva (CP.-122 (33)), circulated for theinformation of his colleagues by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs,after a short discussion (referred to inConclusion 3 below) the Cabinet approved the proposals  in C.P.-122 (33), a summary of which is given in theAppendix.
I AIR BOMBING- .Effect ofAbolit ion.on the Defenceof India.1( previous References:Cabinet 60i (32),  Con-1 elusion 1 &amp;I Appendix; andI Cabinet 19I (32), Con-conclusion ion 9.)3.   The President of the Board of Educationmade enquiry as to what would be the effect of theprohibition of bombing from, the air on the scheme approved for the defence of India.The Cabinet were reminded that the latter schemeinvolved the use of bombing from the air in certaincontingencies beyond the frontiers of India,, inco-ordination with certain military dispositions.It was suggested that without air bombing the defenceof India might have to be conducted less in advanceof the zone of the frontier tribes than was desirable.The mere fact of an aggression by Soviet Russiathrough Afghanistan would, not justify us in the useof bombing if it had been prohibited, unless theenemy had first violated the Convention.It was stated, however, that the militaryauthorities in India, though realising that theywould be handicapped, were prepared to undertake thedefence of India without the assistance of bombingfrom the air.The Secretary of State for Air recalled thatthe Air Ministry had repeatedly called attention tothis aspect of the proposal for the abolition of bombing.The Secretary of State for India said that after this discussion he would telegraph again to theViceroy on the subject.The Prime Minister recalled that the Secretaryof State for India was Chairman of the Defence ofIndia Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence, which he could summon to consider the matter further if it was deemed necessary.
4. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Air (C.P.-121 (33)) covering a Memorandum by the Air Ministry on the questionof the participation of the Royal Air Force in world air records.   The Memorandum stated        cogentobjections to setting out to recapture, at thepresent stage of development, the record recentlyobtained by the Italians, and the Secretary ofState thought it essential that if, as he recommended the decision of the Cabinet was adverse to an attempt on the speed record, there should be no question ofreversing that decision afterwards in response to public pressure.    In the light of the analysiscontained in the Memorandum by his Department, theSecretary of State indicated a policy which seemedboth sound and publicly defensible.    This policyhe summarised as follows:-(l) That His Majesty&apos;s Government shallrefuse to authorise the diversion ofthe Royal Air Force from its normalduties and its employment to secureworld records as suchT where thereis no genuine service purpose to be served thereby;    at the present stage of development an attempt to recapturethe world speed record comes underthis category .(2) That,  in view of the beneficial effecton British prestige and the foreignexport market of the capture of worldrecords by the Royal Air Force (thoughthe latter has been much exaggerated),where, in the normal course of serviceresearch and experimental development,aircraft become available which are suitable for attacks on existing worldrecords, an attempt should be made;.,the height record comes under this category, and it is probable that otherrecords will again do so in due course.After the Secretary of State for Air hadamplified the. information given in his Memorandum,a short discussion took place in the course ofwhich the Secretary of State for Air was urged tomake public, in as complete a form as possible, the
reasons for his decision.    This, it was suggested,might he accomplished by a Question and Answer inthe House of Lords to supplement announcements inthe House of Commons.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet thatthe possibility could, not be ruled out that LadyHouston, who had financed the Schneider Cup prepara-tions, might come forward with a similar offer, inwhich event the Secretary of State for Air might haveto bring the question back to the Cabinet.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary of State for Air,as set forth above, and invited himto consider carefully the best meansof giving to Parliament and thepublic a full statement of thereasons for the decision.-7-
TE monetary and ECONOMICCONFERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 33(33), Con-conclusion ion 2 .)PR5. ^he Prime Minister made a statement to theCabinet on the subject of the forthcoming monetary and Economic Conference, in the course of which he mentioned that although he was to be President ofthe Conference, he was not precluded thereby fromconference with his colleaeru.es on the United kingdom delegation, any more than had been the case at lausanne.   His idea, which the President of theUnited States shared, was to divide the Conferenceinto four stages:-(l) A Second Reading stage in PlenaryConference (which he afterwardssaid on a very rough estimate might take three weeks).(2) A Committee stage (involving possiblyas many as 10 Committees, which might take some time) .(3) A Report stage, at which the Reportsof each Committee would come beforethe Plenary Conference.(4) A Third Reading stage, at whichconsideration would be given toa document setting out all theResolutions resulting from theC conference.This was not quite the normal method of an Inter-national Conference, but would, he thought, prove acceptable.   As President he did not wish to be hampered in matters of procedure by official Bureauxresponsible for offering him advice.   He was only tooglad to get advice, but not in that form.    He was anxious to find a number of very able Chairmen forCommittees, and he hoped for co-operation from hiscolleagues in this respect.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed  
(a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Prime Minister fin the Chair),^he lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, ftThe Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The President of the Board, of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries -should be formed to consider the prepara-tions for the Monetary and EconomicConference.As regards the Secretary of Statefor India, see Conclusion (c).(b) That the Ministers referred to in (a)should form the nucleus of the UnitedKingdom Delegation, though the additionof other Delegates should not be ruled out if this was found desirable.(c) That the Secretary of State for India,though probably too busy to attend theCabinet Committee, should receive the papers, including Notices of Meetings.He would receive Conference Papers asa member of the Indian Delegation.(d) That Sir Maurice Hankey should beattached to the Personal Staff ofthe Prime Minister in his  capacity as President of the Conference, and,in close liaison with the Secretary-General of the Conference, shouldrender the same kind of service, mutatismut and is, to the Prime Minister as inthe past he had rendered as Secretary-General of Conferences .(e) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should be responsiblefor organising (in consultation withthe Secretary to the Cabinet on theSecretarial side) meetings of repre-sentatives of the British CommonwealthDelegates at the Conference, including(notwithstanding recent difficulties)representatives &quot;of the Irish FreeState.(NOTE:    For Hospitality Arrange-ments see Conclusion below.)
6.    The Prime Minister said he was anxious togive an opportunity to some of the younger- Members ofParliament to obtain some contact with the monetary and Economic Conference, and it had occurred to him that this might be done by associating them with thehospitality arrangements.   He had made suggestions tothe First Commissioner of Works in this respect.The Cabinet agreed  (a) &quot;&quot;hat the First Commissioner of works should form a Committee, including representatives of the Departmentsmainly concerned, as well as Membersof Parliament who might be interested,to make all arrangements for hospitality,including, so far as possible, theco-ordination of private hospitalityat the Conference:(b) That any Cabinet Minister whoseDepartmental arrangements offeredfacilities for suitable entertainment(e,g., the Naval Pageant at the royal naval College, Greenwich), or whowould like to offer private hospitality,or who had any suggestions to offer onthe subject, should place himself in communication with the First commissioner of Works ;(c) That,  in view of the position at theDisarmament Conference, technicaldisplays by the Defence Services were,generally speaking, an inappropriateform, of hospitality for the world conference.
THE POLICE.Draft white paper.(previous reference:Cabinet 22(33), Con-clusion 1.)7. The Cabinet had before them copies of a most secret advance proof of-the White Paper on Changesin the Organisation and Administration of the Metro-politan Police (CP.-123 (33)), which had been circxi-lated by authority of the Prime Minister.Certain drafting suggestions were made by theChancellor of the Exchequer, mainly with a view to avoiding any stress on the position of &quot;new Officers&quot;which might be used to support the crlticism that an&quot;Officer class&quot; was being established.^he Home Secretary thanked the Chancellor of theExchequer (whose suggestions covered similar points mentioned hy the Secretary of State for War) and undertook to give careful consideration to the proposedalterations.The Minister of Labour, referring to page 14 ofthe White Paper (third paragraph from end of page)asked that, before taking his final decision to setup a Special Appointments Board, the Home secretary should acquaint himself with the arrangements made bythe Ministry of Labour for maintaining contact withex-Service men.The Home Secretary undertook to consult theMinistry of Labour.   The view was expressed, however,that the Special Appointments Board might be ratheran important- feature of the new scheme.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that hisplan was that the White Paper should be in the VoteOffice on Thursday evening, and should be availablefor the Press of Friday morning. Meetings ofthe Police Federation that morning had been notifiedthat the White Paper would be issued within the next day or two, and had been asked to reserve the submission-sion of Resolutions until after they had received it.
The suggestion was made that the Home secretary should put himself in a position to he able to tell the House of Commons that he was taking all possible steps to secure support for the scheme from thePolice Force itself, and various methods were suggested by which this might be accomplished.   Theone roost favoured was that the Home Secretary should send to every Police Constable a copy of the Report,accompanied by a letter bearing his own facsimileautograph.    It was further suggested that the letter should be given, as nearly as possible, the form ofa typewritten document.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the HomeSecretary&apos;s White Paper entitled&quot;Memorandum on the Object ofcertain Changes in the Organisationand Administration of the MetropolitanPolice Force&quot; for issue as a command paper:(b) That Ministers who had made suggestions for amendments should communicate themdirect to the Home Secretary, with aview to their incorporation at his discretion:(c) That the Home Secretary should giveconsideration to the proposal that he himself should send, to every member ofthe Metropolitan Police Force a copyof the White Paper, accompanied by asuitable letter, with his own facsimileautograph:(d) That the Home Secretary should have authority to give notice, on the evening of Tuesday next, of the formal presentation of theMetropolitan Police Hill (H.A.-14 (33))which was to be considered, by theCommittee of Home Affairs on the morrow and would come before theCabinet at their next regular weekly meeting on Wednesday, May 17th.

The Cabinet took note of a Most SecretSecond Report of the Committee on international economic Policy of the Economic Advisory Council(C.P.-100 (33)), circulated for their informationby direction of the Prime Minister.(previous reference:Cabinet 33(33), Con-clusion 2.)F.R.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 10, 1933.
APPENDIX.DISARMAMENT.POLICY OF THE UNITEDKINGDOM DELEGATION AT GENEVA.CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of Ministers heldat 10, Downing Street, S.W.1. , on Friday,5th May, 1933, at 2.30  p. m.(Paper No. CP,  122(35). )CALIBRE OF G UNS.It was agreed:-(i)    that, in Article 19 of the United KingdomDraft Convention, the reference to guns of105 mm.  calibre should be deleted and thefigure 4.5&quot; only should be quoted.      TheArticle in question should now read as follows:-&quot;The maximum limit for the calibre ofmobile land guns for the future shallbe 4.5&quot;.    Existing mobile land guns upto 155 mm. may be retained but allreplacement or new construction of gunsshall be within the maximum limit of 4.5&quot;.The maximum limit for the calibre ofcoast defence guns shall be 406 mm.&quot;(ii) That an alteration will, also, be required to article 22, third paragraph, which should nowread as follows: -&quot;All guns above 4.5&quot; shall be destroyed so soon as they are replaced by new guns of or below 4.5&quot;.&quot;DESTRUCTION OF MATERIAL.It was agreed:-that the periods to be prescribed forthe destruction of material underArticle 22 should oorrespond with theperiod of the Convention which, atpresent, is assumed to be five years.TANKS.It was agreed:-(a)    that since it was impossible to agree toa Tank Truce, the only alternative wasto allow Germany to have a token figure which could probably best be decided by
negotiations on the spot.    It should bemade quite clear in the course of these negotiations that the principle had always been accepted that Germany should reach equality by stages and not in theform of an omnibus concession.(b)    that the figure to be inserted in the tables of the number of tanks to beallowed to the United Kingdom might bein accordance with the probable progressof the War Office construction programme,the actual number being dependent on the duration of the Convention and the provisionof a definite safeguard that, in time ofemergency, it would be possible to derogatefrom the figures finally inserted.BOMBING IN OUTLYING REGIONS.It was agreed:-(a) that it was essential for us to retain the reservation to Article 34, permittingpolice bombing in outlying regions;(b) that in putting forward our case for themaintenance of the reservation to Article 34,it could be explained that we were onlyasking to preserve the right of actionwhich we had been taking for a great numberof years,in some cases under the actualaegis of the League Mandates Commission:    thatthere was every difference in the world betweenoffensive bombing in a war and the type of bombing we employed for the maintenance ofpeace in outlying regions, which experience had shewn was both humanitarian and economic.It might further be pointed out that if this right was no longer conceded, it might benecessary for us very greatly to increase thenumbers of our military effectives.(c) to instruct the Secretary, in consultationwith the Departments concerned, to prepare a Note for the guidance of Mr.  Eden, on thelines of those suggested by the Secretary ofState for Air and the Foreign Office.(The Note agreed is as follows):-
tiIn accordance with Conclusion 5 (c) of the Meeting ofMinisters held on Friday. May 5th, 19335 a meeting was held with representatives of the Foreign Offices India OfficesColonial Office9 and Air Ministry^ and the attached formulawas agreed.Particular5 attention is drawn to the following points in connection with this formula:-(a) In case the Afghan Government should heinclined to raise any questions as towhether the formula contemplates thepossibility of bombing in Afghan territory,it is suggested., that Mr-. Eden mightexplain private^ to the representativeof the Afghan Government that such is notour intention.    80 far as India isconcerned the outlying regions which wehave in mind would be British territoriesor territories under British protection,,(b) The formula suggested is made entirelyapplicable to &quot;outlying regions&quot;.    this may mean, so far as interpretation atGeneva is concerned, that we are debarred,from taking air action in the last resortin any place which cannot properly be described as outlying, e.g. in defence ofa British cantonment in India.    The AirMinistry are particularly anxious thatthis possible implication is fully appreciated.(c) The question of our position vis-a vis the sultan of Muscat and the Arab States on thePersian Gulf was considered.    It was felt to be difficult to put in any specific reference which would., in fact, cover theposition if we were asked by any of these local rulers to assist them with air action.    Legally speaking, these
States are independent and they arenot members of the League of Nations.It is assumed that we should be perfectlycovered if we took any action at their request but attention is drawn to thispoint in case any questions should arise in future.(d) A paragraph has been inserted covering theposition of the Iraqi Government.     Atelegram has been despatched to Iraq,seeking the support and agreement of the iraqi Government in including this para-graph in the formula.      Unless and until afavourable reply has been received fromthe Iraqi Government,however, obviouslythis paragraph cannot be used.(e) No mention has been made of the questionof reporting any action of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the League.        There isparticular objection to making any specific provision for such reports fromthe point of view of the Government ofIndia.      In recent years frequent occasionshave arisen for separate minor air operations and the Government of India- might be putin a very invidious position if, as is verypossible, air action took place only inIndia and with-considerable frequency there and they were forced to make reports to geneva at comparatively short intervals.    Ifpressed on this point, it is suggested that Mr.Eden should refer to Article 77 of theDraft Convention and should intimate that machinery exists under this Article wherebyany complaints can be investigated.    if mr. Eden should be further pressed on thispoint,  it is requested that he should refer the matter back again.to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  so that the Government  ofIndia can be consulted.      The Secretary ofState for India does not feel able toaccept any proposal beyond the suggestedreference to Article 77 under this headunless the Government of India have been consulted.
FORMULA REGARDING THE DEFINITION OF BOMBING INOUTLYING PLAGES.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom proposeto retain the right to employ, in outlying regions ofBritish territories and territories under British protectionor mandate and in disturbed frontier areas, air action for police purposes, since in their experience it is incertain circumstances the most humane and the only effective system of restoring order.     By &quot;outlying regions&quot; theymean undeveloped or sparsely inhabited areas where, owingeither to their inaccessibility or remoteness from centres of civilisation or to climatic conditions, ground operations would require the use of disproportionately large forces and involve the risk of unnecessarily heavy casualties on both sides.     Among the areas they have in mind are the aden Protectorate, the Mandated Territories in the middle east, and the frontier tracts of India;   but if other suitable means of pacification were unavailable it might prove necessary to employ air action in other similarlyremote territories.His Majesty&apos;s Government have been asked by the iraqi government to state that they consider that the right to employ air action within Iraq cannot be relinquished under present conditions, and His Majesty&apos;s Government associate themselves with this view,&quot;
It was agreed:-that the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs should arrange for a Conference of theHigh Commissioners of the Dominions in thiscountry,  in order to discuss with them thefigures they proposed to insert in the tables in the Convention for the numbers of aircraft, with a view to seeing if   it waspossible to arrange for a reduction in thefigures which it was understood they areat present contemplating.
