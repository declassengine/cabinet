1. The Cabinet was summoned at short notice toconsider further developments of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer^ negotiations with the Co-operative societies ,The Chancellor of the Exchequer apologised to hiscolleagues for asking for this Meeting, but explainedthat he wanted to ask the Cabinet to alter their previous decision.   After describing his negotiationsup to the point of the last Meeting of the Cabinet,he read to his colleagues an official reply which hehad received as the result of a joint meeting betweenthe Executive Committee 0? the Co-operatives and their income Tax Special Committee.    They informed him thatthe GoArernment&apos;s proposals were entirely unacceptable,though they were willing to listen to any other proposals he might make.    In this connection they mentioned thatthey were holding a further meeting on Wednesday next.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was away at thetime, had, on receipt of this letter, drafted a replyand sent it to the Treasury for despatch.   Before his reply was sent, however, Mr Alexander had telephoneda resolution by the Executive Committee indicating that the Co-operative Societies already paid more taxthan was properly payable, but intimating that theywere willing to discuss the position further.   TheChancellor of the exchequer had then added a postscriptindicating that he would be happy to receive a Deputa-tion on Monday, April 24th, at 4 p.m.   That invitationhad been accepted, and he would meet representativesof the Co-operatives the same afternoon at the hournamed.In the meantime, the Chancellor of the exchequer said, he had given further consideration to theproposal approved by the Cabinet at their earlier
Meetings.    The more he looked at it the less heliked it.   Without the co-operation of theCo-operative Societies the plan was indefensible.The Retail Societies would pay too much?   more,indeed, than they would have to pay under the RaeburnReport, and the Wholesale Societies would pay too little.    Some Income Tax would be paid twice over,namely, once by the Society and once by the recipients.Moreover,  in the absence of an agreement it would bepossible for the Societies to convert their sharesinto loan capital, in which case they would be -ableto avoid payment. Many of the recipients ofinterest would not pay anything in Income Tax, as their income was below? the level.    In the result,therefore, the Exchequer would actually receive lessTax than they did before.In the circumstances there appeared to theChancellor of the Exchequer to be only two courses:-(l) To do nothing:(2) To adopt the Raeburn Report:which? however, raised thequestion of &quot;mutuality&quot;.He thought the fact that the Co-operatives had askedfor a further meeting showed   what had beenconveyed to him from other sources   that a sectionof the Co-operatives at any rate wanted to come to anagreement.   When he saw their representatives thesame afternoon he expected them to state that theGovernmentfs proposals were hopeless from their point of view and to ask him if he had anything elseto propose.   He would reply in the negative, andwould ask them if they could make a suggestion.He did not think there was the least prospect oftheir making any offer worthy of consideration.
When that- stage was reached he wished to be in aposition to say that on behalf of the Government he must refuse their proposal;    that, in the desire toreach a settlement of this long controversy, he wasvery anxious to continue the discussions, but was bound to say something in his Budget Speech on thesubject;    and that he proposed to obtain from theHouse of Commons in Committee an Enabling Resolutioncovering the whole of the Raeburn Report.   ThisEnabling Resolution, however, he would explain, wouldnot become operative until it became part of theFinance Bill.   That would give some time for further discussion.   With this decision in his hands he thoughthe would be in an adA^antageous position for negotia-tions .   He believed that with the help of the Co-operative Societies the experts of the Board of InlandRevenue could probably find some compromise.The Chancellor of the Exchequer realised that hecould not expect to get agreement by the time theFinance Bill was introduced. In that event he proposedto introduce into the Finance Bill a provision basedon the Raeburn Report.    If no agreement had been cometo by the time the Committee Stage of this provision was reached, he proposed to add to the provision inquestion a suspensory clause so as to give time forfurther discussion, if necessary.    If, however, bythat time a disagreement had been reached, then he would come back to. the Cabinet for a fresh decision.The Chancellor then read to the Cabinet a passage from the draft of his Budget Speech dealing with thissubject, showing how he proposed to present it to theHouse of Commons .
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairssupported the proposal of the Chancellor of theExcheqvier.   He would have liked, as his colleaguesknew, to see the whole subject dropped, but he realised that the Chancellor of the Exchequer couldnot avoid saying something on the matter in his budget Speech,    His information was to the effectthat the Co-operative Societies were divided on thissubject.   On the political side they hoped for nothing more than that the Government would destroy theprinciple of mutuality.    The business side, however,wanted a settlement.   The latter did not seek todefend the exemption from taxation of profits fromtrading with outsiders, but claimed that the taxation on these profits was actually covered by their othertaxation.   He agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer that the original scheme was defective.Its inclusion in the Finance Bill would draw so much criticism as to destroy the effect of the Budget.The only alternative was to show the House of commons that negotiations were still taking place.   The only question on which he felt some doubt was as to whether anything would be lost if the Chancellor made astatement of the Government&apos;s intentions on the linehe proposed without obtaining an Enabling Resolution.^he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the proposal was new to him, but rather alarmedhim.   The taking of powers to tax undistributedreserves seemed inconsistent with respecting theprinciple of mutuality.   The original proposal wasto tax the income of Co-operative Societies fromthe investment of undistributed reserves.   TheRaeburn Report, however,  involved a tax not onincome, but on the total of investments.   He thoughtthat would create a difficult situation.   He was not-4-
opposing the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal,but he thought that the Resolution was likely to be passed by a very reduced majority, and this would not do the Government much good.   What would be the effect,he asked, after the discussions with the Co-operativeshad been taking place oh such a much milder basis,of informing them that this much wider Resolution wasto be passed?The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained thathis intention was to see the representatives of theCo-operatives the same afternoon.    It was possible,of course, that when he informed them of his inten-tions they might say that in that event they wouldhave to break off negotiations.   He hoped, however,that he would be able to make them, realise theintention of the Government to discuss the question,and that the powers now taken would only be exercised in the last resort if agreement could not be reached.Without any powers of this kind he would be in a veryweak position.In the course of the discussion the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer made it quite clear that, in the eventof his being unable to reach agreement with theCo-operative Societies, he would ask the Cabinet(after the return of the Prime Minister) for a freshdecision before the final stages of the Finance Bill.Fie also said that if the Cabinet would give him thedecision he required he would like to be free, after his discussion with the Co-operative Societies, todo something less if he thought it advisable.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should have authority, in his inter-view with the representatives of theCo-operatives the same afternoon, totake the following line:-(i) mo refuse any unacceptableproposal from the Societies:(ii) mo inform them that he was ready to continue discitssionsin the most friendly way, butthat he was bound to make some statement on the subject in his budget Speech on the following day;(iii) To inform them that he proposedto obtain, from the House ofCommons in Committee an EnablingResolution based on the whole ofthe Raeburn Report, but notoperative until the substance of it was passed, as a provisionof the Finance Bill:    this would,give time for discussions in the interval:(b) That if discussions were still contin-uing by the date at which the finance bill was to be introduced, a provision should be included based on the RaeburnReport:(c) That if dis ctiss ions were still contin-uing by the time the Committee stage of the Bill was reached, the clausereferred to in (b) should be passed,with a suspensory clause to give timefor further discussion:(d) ^hat if disagreement was reached beforethe stage referred, to in (c), theChancellor of the Exchequer should ask for a fresh decision from theCabinet, by which time it was hopedthat the Prime Minister would be present:(e) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should, have discretion, at hisdiscussion with the representativesof the Co-operative Societies thesame afternoon, to adopt some milderline than the above if, as the resultof the interview, he thought thisdes irable.
RUSSIA. 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,^rial of in reply to questions from his colleagues, statedPr.it ishSubjects. that he had that morning, at the Forezgn Office,The Russian seen the deportees who had just, returned from Moscow.Goods (import prohibition) They all paid a high tribute to the great help andAC  &quot; Ffc.3i(33);2. assistance received from Mr Strang, the British(Previous Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires at Moscow.    All those who had reference:Cabinet 29 returned from Moscow also agreed that these gentlemenfc( p &apos;6) , Gon-clusion 1.) release was due to the firm attitude and action ofthe British Government,   He had warned them that anything they said in public must be attuned solely to its effect on their comrades who had not yet been released.   Mr Thornton&apos;s appeal had been presentedlast Friday.   Mr Macdonaldrs appeal had not yet beenlodged, but there was some reason to suppose thatthis delay was for tactical reasons, though maskedunder the supposed indisposition of his Counsel.The released gentlemen had not been able to throw anylight on the curious episode in the trial whereMr Macdonald, after a short adjournment, had retractedthe plea of &quot;Wot guilty&quot;, which he had made unexpeeted-ly a few minutes before .    Even more unexpected tothem had been Mr Thornton1s alleged confessions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedthat the Russian Trade Delegation had now left thiscountry, but their wives were still here.The President of the Board of Trade, in reply to questions, said that where Soviet Russia would be hit by the Russian Goods (import Prohibition) Act wasthat without the credits they built up here from) their export trade they would be unable to pay for goods ordered in other countries .   As he had neverconcealed, however, British trade would also behit.1   - -7-
In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to Sir Alfred Pease*s letter in &quot;The Times&quot; of even date on the subject of doors from Russia,The Secretary of State for War asked that a briefmight be provided by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs for use either by the Secretary ofState for Air or himself for a reply to a resolution to be moved in the Rouse of Lords by Lord Ponsonbyon the following day.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 24, 19 33.
