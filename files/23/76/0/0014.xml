The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the Bureau had met that day at Geneva and had agreed unanimously that thebest plan would be to adjourn until October.   Thisrecommendation would come before the General Commissionon Thursday next.    It was probable that the proceedingsof the General Commission would be formal.   TheParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was accordingly returning to London and leaving Mr Cadogan, of the Foreign Office, to representthe United Kingdom Delegation at the General Commission.A possible difficulty that might arise from thispostponement was that the German Government mightclaim that it had been very patient but must now insist on re-arming. , He had received a message from M. Paul-Bone our to the effect that the only necessity at themoment was to stop Germany from re-arming.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs paid a tribute to the good offices of Mr Arthur Henderson,whan he and the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had seen together.   At first Mr Henderson had beeneager to proceed with the discussion of the draftConvention with a view to eliminating the less contro-versial matters.    Subsequently, however, he had agreedthat the real issue lay between Germany and France,and he had undertaken to convene a conference with aview to clearing up this situation.   Such a conference should help to show where responsibility lay for the delays in disarmament.The Prime Minister expressed the hope that the conversations on Disarmament would be pursued duringthe adjournment, as this was the only means of promoting Disarmament,
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed,but explained that the difficulty was that the french foreign Minister did not wish to meet the Germans .The Cabinet took note of the Papersbefore them and of the statementss ummaris e d ab ove .-   (Note:    Accompanying one of the documents(CP.  167(33))  is an Extract from the Conclusionsof a Meeting of the Ministerial Committee on disarmament held on June 19th, 1933, which isattached as an Appendix to these Minutes.)1.14 i

AUSTRIA.LoanGuaranteeBill.(previous reference:Cabinet 64(32), Gon-clusion 10)5.  The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C .P.-166(33)) circulating for the information of hiscolleagues a Memorandum prepared in his Departmentregarding the present situation in Austria.The Prime Minister said that this was&apos; a usefulsummary of a complicated question which changed from day to day.The Cabinet took note of the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP.-166 (33)).
PORTUGAL. 6* The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theTreaty President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-155 (33)) onObligations g a b,eot of portUguese Flag Discrimination. Afterwith. d                      o              o(Previousoutlining the history of the question the MemorandumReference.       stated that the Portuguese Government were nowCabinet 53(27), Con-       prepared to abolish discrimination in Porttigal andelusion 2) .3//V7J5-      the adjacent islands in June,  1934, and in thePortuguese Colonies in June, 1936, provided that HisMajesty&quot;s Government would give an undertaking tomaintain the present protection of Portuguese winesfor a period of five years from the second date.The President of the Board of Trade recommended tohis colleagues the acceptance of this compromise.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinet that he had seen thePortuguese Ambassador and had reached agreement onthe lines proposed by the President of the Board ofTrade.The Cabinet took note of, and approved, the Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade(cp.-155 (33)) and the statement by the Secretary of State for -Foreign Affairs.
$*AWE       NOR^H 7.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byBORNEO.&quot;      __ the Secretary of State for the Colonies  (CP.-146(33)) outlining a suggestion for the purchase, byHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the Straits SettlementsColony, of the State of North Borneo from the british north Borneo (Chartered) Company, in the interestof closer co-operation between the four separateBritish administrations in Borneo.   After setting forth the arguments in favour of the project, whichhad the support of the Governor of the Colony, theSecretary of State sought directions from the cabinet as to whether the Colonial office should open negotia-tions with the Company with a view to ascertaining(without committing His Majesty&apos;s&quot; Government) what are the minimum terms that the Company would accept.The Secretary of State for the Colonies reportedthat this question had been the subject of consideration for some time, and he and the Chancellor of theExchequer had agreed that it should be set at rest bya Cabinet decision.   At the present time the State of. North Borneo was adequately administered byBritishthe/North Borneo Chartered Company.    If taken over byHis Majesty&apos;s Government the administration might perhaps be more efficient but would probably cost agood deal more.   At the present time the purchasecould probably be achieved relatively cheaply.    Onthe other hand, the cost would be considerable, andthe Straits Settlements had no funds for the purchase,which would have to be made by the British Exchequer.aroseUnless, therefore, some over-riding Imperial interest/(e.g., to prevent Japan from buying land) there appeared no strong reason for making the purchase atthe present time.
The Cabinet were informed that from the point ofview of Imperial defence the value of North Borneowas negative.    Our main object was to prevent any-other country from obtaining, possession.   As long as.the State was in the hands of the British north borneo Chartered, Company the War Office were satisfied.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said therewas no danger of the State being disposed of.    Inreply to a question from the Prime Minister, he saidthat if at any future time financial reasons shouldcompel the Company to dispose of the State of north borneo, it might be necessary to reconsider thequestion.The Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for theColonies should take no action to open negotiations with the Company.-10-

flE HOTELS ANDESTAURANT SILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 22(33), Con-elusion 14.)9, The Home Secretary said that this was one of anumber of Private Members&apos; Bills which, if proceeded with, would have to be carried over to the autumn.There was a large body of opinion in favour of it,and there was something to be said for the Bill fromthe point of view of employment and of bringing people to this country.   The Bill was based on recommendations by a Royal Commission.The Lord President of the Council said there wouldbe no time for any Private Members&apos; Bills before the recess.    It might, however, be starred and kept overwith other Private Members&apos; Bills for decision afterthe Recess as to whether it should be proceeded with.The Cabinet were reminded that, although the bill was strongly supported, its passage would expose theGovernment to criticism in some quarters .The Cabinet agreed with the proposal of the Lord President of the Councilon the understanding that the Governmentshould not be committed in any wayeither for or against the Bill.
the FIREARMSAND IMITATIONFIREARMS(CRIMINAL USE)bill.by the Home Secretary (H.A.-19 (33)) covering thedraft Firearms and Imitation Firearms (Criminal Use)Bill:    together with the following recommendationof the Committee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.G. 8thConclusions (33), Paragraph 1):-To authorise the introduction inthe House of Lords of the Firearmsand Imitation Firearms (Criminal Use)Bill, in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-19 (33), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable irable .The Cabinet approved the above recommendation of the Committeeof Home Affairs,

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byuggested Use      the Secretary of State for India (C.P.-161 (33))Tear Gasor Dispersing    circulating for the information of his colleagues acopy of a letter from the Government of India, in whichPrevious proposal was made that the Government of the Punjab/Reference* Jjhabinet 27 should be authorised to make experimental use ofpO) , Con-conclusion   2). tear-gas for police purposes, within a limited field,in situations such as arise when armed criminals are70633)3brought to bay in a house or place of refuge.    TheSecretary of State proposed to inform the Governmentof India that, subject to their further considerationof the possibility of retaliation in kind by criminals,a limited experiment of the kind suggested might beundertaken, and that a full report of its workingshould be s\ibmitted to him for consideration by HisMajestyfs Government.The Home Secretary reminded the Cabinet that thisquestion might arise later in,connection with Policemeasures at home.   There had been experiments withtear-gas which tended to show that in certain cases,comparable, for example, with the Sydney Street affair,the use of this weapon might avoid loss of life.The President of the Board of Education called attention to the very limited extent of the proposal of the Secretary of State for India.    As the resultof his own experience as Viceroy he was inclined tosupport the proposal, though he would have preferred that the Secretary of State for India should have been present.The Cabinet agreed  That there was no objection to an experimental use of tear-gas for police purposes in India on the limited lines suggested in theMemorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (CP.-161 (33)).
12,The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (CP.-164 (33)) 6n the subjectof a temporary grant for distressed areas .   In thisMemorandum the Minister stated that the proposal thatthe more fortunate areas should be asked to make some contribution out of their share of the block grant for the current financial year towards helping the hard-pressed areas, supplemented by an additional contribution from the Exchequer, had not provedacceptable to Local Authorities, who opposed any suggestion which would have the effect that moneyfound by one group of authorities should be spent by another.    In view of the desirability of preserving the existing cordial cooperation between the centralGovernment and the Local Authorities, the Minister-thought it would be inexpedient to introduce legis la-tion making the contribution compulsory, and accordingly proposed that the Exchequer should provide the sum of 500,000 for Great Britain for this purpose.   TheChancellor of the Exchequer had concurred in theproposal, and the Minister of Health asked the authorityof the Cabinet for the introduction of the necessarySupplementary Estimate.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that as itMeeting of he had  not been possible to summon a^,Cabinet in the previousweek, after informal consultation with some of hiscolleagues he had authorised the Minister of health to take action..The Cabinet took note that action had been taken on the Memorandumby the Minister of Health (CP.-.164 (33)).
13. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Minister of Transport and the Treasury (C.P.-169(33)) in pursuance of a request by the Cabinet, atthe Meeting referred to in the margin, presenting astatement of what powers are required and whatproposals are agreed in order to push on with theelectrification of suburban railways; and suggesting that, if the Government eventually decided to give,financial assistance in order to accelerate the starting of work, the appropriate procedure would belegislation on an ad hoc basis *The discussion revealed a very strong desire onthe part of the Cabinet that there should be no delay in putting in hand the electrification of the suburbanrailways affected, in order to relieve unemploymentduring the forthcoming winter.The Minister of Transport explained that at themoment the main line railways concerned had no powerto negotiate or proceed with the work, since, as theresult of the passing of the London Passenger transport act, they had to await the examination of their proposals by a Joint Committee which had not yet comeinto existence.   Electrification schemes within thearea of the London Passenger Transport Board had tobe considered by a Standings Joint Committee providedfor by the London Passenger Transport Act, to consistof four members appointed by the London passenger transport Board and four members appointed by theamalgamated Railway Companies.   The Board had just been appointed, and steps were being taken to ensurethat the Standing Joint Committee was established and got to work.   mhe London Passenger transport board would meet at a very early date and appoint their representatives, after which theJoint Committee would be formed arsd would consider-16-
M7this question.   Meanwhile the schemes of both theLondon and North Eastern and the London Midland and scottish Companies for the electrification of certain of their London suburban lines were in an advancedstate of preparation.   The carrying out of these schemes, however,  depended on their finance.    On thefinancial aspect of these schemes the passing of theLondon Passenger Transport Act had brought about a fundamental change in the position.   Under that act the whole of the passenger receipts of the Board andof the main line railways (so far as their suburbanservices were concerned) were to be pooled, and theBoard were empowered to participate financially inany new schemes which might be approved by the JointCommittee.    In the light of the change of circumstances and of the lapse of the powers contained in theDevelopment Act of 1929, the question of financialassistance was not automatically governed by theaction taken on past cases at a time when it was theGovernments policy to subsidise public works of manykinds where employment was provided.   Until detailed estimates had been prepared it was premature toindicate on what basis Exchequer assistance might be proposed.The Cabinet were reminded that in the course ofthe Debate on the London Passenger Transport Billstatements had been made in both Houses of Parliamentto the effect that the Act would expedite the carryingout of this work:    in fact, it was hardly too much tosay that these statements had proved a decisive factor in passing the Act.    It was suggested that theMinister of Transport should not hesitate to confrontthe Railway Companies with these statements and to
recall the circumstances in-which they had been made.It was further suggested that pressure might be puton the Joint Committee to press forward at once withthe financial aspects of the scheme and to reach adecision before the end of July.In authorising the Minister of Transport to continue his discussions with the Railway Companies concerned,the Cabinet invited him to make full use of the state-ments made in Parliament in the course of debate,to spare no effort to ensure that the proposed electrical -fication was proceeded with without delay, and to use his utmost endeavour to secure that the Joint Committeeshould take *.v\e matter ud at the earliest possible moment, so that he might be in a position toreport to the Cabinet at an early date as to thepossibilities of schemes being put in hand at once.
mHE ROAD 14. The Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumTRAFFIC      t(AMENDMENT)     by the Minister of Transport (H.A.-20 (S3)) coveringbill.the draft Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill:    together(Previous with the following recommendations of the CommitteeReference:Cabinet 22 of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C. 8th Conclusions (33)(33), Con-clusion 12.)

Copy No.    4 4CP. 167 (33).CABINET.FUTURE   PROCEDURE   OF   THE   DISARMAMENT   CONFERENCE.Record of a Conversation with Mr. Henderson.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WITH reference to Cabinet 39 (33), Conclusion 1 (b), I circulate to mycolleagues a memorandum prepared, at my request, by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, giving the record of a discussion withMr. Henderson on the future procedure of the Disarmament Conference.J. S.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,June 22, 1933.Mr. HENDERSON, accompanied by M. Aghnides and Mr. Noel Baker, cameby appointment to see me yesterday afternoon (the 20th June), to discuss thefuture procedure of the Disarmament Conference. The Secretary of State torForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for the Dominions were present to the greater part of the meeting.Mr. HENDERSON explained that it had so far been impossible to initiatein London conversations on the subject of disarmament. More especially, it had proved impossible to secure an appointment with M. Daladier. In thesecircumstances it remained to be considered what could be done at the meetingsof the Bureau, on the 27th June, and the General Commission, on the 3rd July.Mr. Henderson had seen Mr. Norman Davis last Saturday before the latter departure for the United States. Mr. Henderson understood that Mr. NormanDavis could not be back in this country before about the 10th July, and m thesecircumstances he had enquired of Mr. Davis whether the latter did not think thatit would be best to postpone the meetings referred to. Mr. Davis had replied thathe would not favour simple postponement. He thought it would be possible tokeep the General Commission going on throughout the month of July.In reply to an enquiry as to the actual questions with which the GeneralCommission would occupy itself, Mr. Henderson explained that he thought thattime could be saved bv taking a second reading of a number of articles which werenot really the subject of controversy. Further discussion elicited the fact thatthese would resolve themselves into certain of the articles relating to supervision and chemical warfare. It was pointed out to Mr. Henderson that althoughcertain of these articles presented no real difficulty, there was little reality in discussing them whilst certain of the vital questions concerning even these points were left in abeyance.It was explained to Mr. Henderson that His Majesty&apos;s Government felt thatthere was a danger of the Conference relapsing into what the Prime Minister inbis speech at Geneva had called &apos;&apos; compartmental discussion.&quot; The British Draft[8763]
Convention had been put forward as a means of avoiding this pitfall, but we weregradually being led on to other ground by, in particular, the French Delegation,who, whilst refraining from pronouncing on the really essential principles of theBritish draft, invited us to consider far-reaching amendments to certain portions of it as well as certain wholly extraneous subjects. His Majesty&apos;s government felt strongly that until we knew whether the underlying difference between Franceand Germany could be remedied by the acceptance of the British draft as a wholeit was really undesirable to continue public discussion of individual articles atGeneva. They felt that the only means of eliciting the true attitude both ofFrance and of Germany towards the Convention as a whole was to discuss thematter quite frankly with those Delegations in private and informal conversation.It was with this object in view that the Bureau and the General Commission hadadjourned a fortnight ago; owing to various circumstances it had proved impossible during the last fortnight to engage in the necessary conversations andtherefore we should be faced at Geneva with exactly the situation that had ledto adjournment on the 8th June. Would it not therefore be better for mr. Henderson when the Bureau assembled to explain frankly that time had proved insufficient, and the circumstances had been unfavourable for the conversations, and to suggest therefore that he should be allowed to summon the bureau at a later date when matters might be sufficiently advanced to afford a prospect of the Bureau and the General Commission making good progress withthe work ?Mr. HENDERSON indicated that he would be quite prepared to do thisprovided he were assured that the British Delegation Avould immediately come tohis support and that he would have the support also of the United states delegation.Mr. THOMAS said he was confident that he could state on behalf of theBritish Cabinet that such a proposal would be supported, but he suggested thatMr. Eden should, in the course of the next twenty-four hours, obtain confirmation of this from the Prime Minister. It was agreed also to communicate withMr. Norman Davis through Mr. Dulles with a view to ascertaining whether theproposal would have the support of the United States Delegation.Some discussion ensued as to the possibility of starting conversations in thenear future, and it was suggested that an attempt should be made to do thisimmediately on Mr. Davis&apos;s return from the United States next month.Mr. Henderson might issue formal invitations to the French and other delegations whom it- might be necessary to consult to meet him either in london or elsewhere as might seem most convenient. Mr. Henderson himself suggestedthat the signature of the Four-Power Pact might have a direct bearing upon this procedure. Article 3 of the Four-Power Pact provided for consultation on thesubject of disarmament. He enquired as to the prospects of an early signature of the Four-Power Pact and where signature would be likely to take place. TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed-Mr. Henderson of the state of negotiations concerning the signature, which could not be long deferred.Sir John Simon undertook also to look into the possibility of arranging for formal-signature in London, if that were possible, though he feared that this might not be acceptable to Signor Mussolini. This might afford the occasion for M. Daladier and other representatives to come to London, and, if this were so, opportunity might be taken of their presence here to enter into conversations.&apos;   &apos;&quot;      :! *&apos;&apos;; ;&apos;; (Initialled) A.
