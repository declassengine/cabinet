GERMANY,foreign3olicy of.I( previous Reference:1 Cabinet ISI (33), Oon-1 elusion 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-129(33)) outlining the foreign policy of the presentGerman Government., which he described as &quot;definitelydisquieting&quot;, and pointing out, with illustrations,that the Government of Germany, for the first time since the War, are giving State sanction and encouragement-encouragement  to an attitude of mind, as well as to various forms of military training, which could end in onlyone way.   Attached to the Memorandum was a Paperprepared by the military expert to the United kingdom delegation at the Disarmament Conference reviewing the present state of German armaments and summarising the evidence of German re-armament, which has been intensified since Herr Hitler became Chancellor.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs didnot ask the Cabinet to discuss the question in detailat the moment.    Such discussion could not usefullytake place until after the German Chancellor&apos;s speech.He drew particular attention to the following messagethat Sir H* Rumbold had been asked to convey to herr hitler, as set out on page 5 of the Memorandum:-&quot;At this critical juncture in the life of the Disarmament Conferenceand on the eve of the World EconomicConference, it is clearly in theinterests of the whole world, and not least of Germany herself, that inter-national tranquility and confidence inEurope should be preserved and, ifpossible, increased.   Unfortunately,the recent change of regime in germany has produced the opposite effect  a fact which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdeeply deplore.   We trust, therefore,that during the difficult time ahead of us all we may hope that the GermanGovernment will not merely abstain from doing or saying anything which may increase the already existing nervous-ness in the public opinion of Europe,but that it will go further and, withinthe framework and in the spirit of theCovenant of the league of Nations,collaborate in the common task of
establishing that confidence whichis necessary to the siiccess of theDisarmament Conference., which isthe aim of the Pour-Power Pactnegotiations, and which is essentialto the success of the World EconomicConference&quot;.In view of the existing delicate position inforeign affairs, the Prime Minister asked hiscolleagues to be particularly careful in any unavoidable-able public reference to matters of foreign policywhich by force of circumstances they might find themselves compelled to make.The Cabinet agreed  That the passage in the Secretaryof State&apos;s Memorandum referred toabove was in accord with thegeneral policy of the Government.(NOTE: The Prime Minister warned theCabinet that events (e .g., atGeneva) arising, out of herr hitler&apos;s speech might compelhim to summon a Special Meetingof the Cabinet within the nextfew days ,)
PRESIDENT 2, The Prime Minister drew the attention of theROOSEVELT&apos; SSTATEMENT. Cabinet to the fact that President Roosevelt hadThe Constitu-     addressed direct to the King his statement to thetional Aspect.nations of the world dealing mainly with the Confer-ences on Disarmament and Monetary and Economic Policy .This appeared to be an incorrect procedure and raised the question of what attitude His Majesty shmild be advised by his responsible Ministers to adopt.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that the King was the Head of the Empireas well as of the United Kingdom.    So far as theUnited Kingdom was concerned His Majesty would naturally be advised by the Ministers concerned,but Constitutional questions arose affecting theDominions, e.g., as to whether His Majesty shouldtransmit President Roosevelt&apos;s message to the Dominionsand consult them as to any reply or acknowledgment.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the United States embassy had communicated to the Foreign Office copies of thePresident&apos;s statement.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should seek the advice of the Lord chancellor and the Law Officers of the Crownon the Constitutional issties raised(both as affecting the United Kingdomand the Empire) by President Roosevelt&apos;transaction in addressing his communicationdirect to the King:(b) That the Prime Minister should advise the King for the moment to send noacknowledgment or reply to PresidentRoosevelfs message as constitutional issues were involved,on which thePrime Minister would make a further communication to His Majesty afterconsultation with the appropriateConstitutional authorities.
b PRESIDENT 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsROOSEVELT SSTATEMENT. gave the Cabinet an appreciation of president the Substance.     Roosevelt&apos;s message, in the course of which he pointed out that the proposal  &quot;that no nation shallincrease its existing armaments over and above the limitations of treaty obligations&quot; was not likelyto please Germany or other ex-enemy States, as theywere bound by treaty obligations and other nationswere not.It was also pointed out that by a strict inter-pretation of the fourth step proposed by president roosevelt, under which the Signatory Powers would&quot;agree that they would send no armed force of whatever nature across their frontiers&quot;, a Fleetcould not leave territorial waters and the positionof British or American troops at Shanghai would be a breach.
4. The Cabinet took note of atelegram (CP.-126 (S3)) despatched to the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, atGeneva, on May 12th, following a Meeting of the ministerial Committee on Disarmament which was heldon the same day, and circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister, the Chairman ofthe Committee,   The telegram related to Germany&apos;attitude at the Disarmament Conference and suggested the line that the Parliamentary Under-secretary should adopt.TNE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE.United kingdom policy atGeneva.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(33), Con-clusion 1.)
