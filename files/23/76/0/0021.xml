ARGENTINETARIFF NEGO-jTATIONS.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(33), Con-elusion 4.)1.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum &quot;by thePresident of the Board of trade (C.P.-199 (33)) relatingto negotiations at present proceeding at Buenos .Aireswith a view to securing concessions from Argentina intariff matters .   The Agreement which it is hoped to conclude on this subject will be supplementary to theConvention signed on May 1st, which accorded to theUnited Kingdom concessions with regard to remittancesfrom Argentina, and to Argentina certain safeguardswith regard to our regulations, of the importation of meat.    It was provided that the Convention could be denounced at any time after August 1st if in the meantimeagreement had not been reached on the matter of tariffs.From the latest information from Buenos Aires it seemed clear that a short extension of time after that date would have to be allowed.   We had not yet secured the concessions we require on certain classes of goods of paramount interest to our trade, and it might therefore be necessary In the near future to threaten the Argentine Government with termination of the existingConvention.    The President of the Board of Trade therefore asked authority, after consultation with the PrimeMinister or the Lord President of the Couneil, to use this threat if necessary, and to carry it out if it proved impossible to secure satisfaction in any other way.    Should the negotiations proceed satisfactorily,however, the President of the Board of Trade assumed that he would have authority to authorise the signature of a Supplementary Agreement as soon as it appeared that satisfactory terms had been arranged.The Cabinet agreed  Parliamentary9.er-Secretary ofte for Foreignairs, who was notpsent at this dis-ssion   has writtenthe President ofe Board of Tradeing that the Foreign^ice shall also besuited, as politicalfederations arevoived.(a) That the President of the Board ofTrade should have the authority forwhich he asked, after consultationwrith the Prime Minister, or the lord president of the Council in his absence.,34to use, if necessary, the threat to terminate the existing ArgentineConvention. -
In giving this authority theCabinet expressed the hope thatthe President of the Board ofTrade would not find, it necessaryto use it.(b) ^hat if negotiations should proceedsatisfactorily, the President of theBoard of Trade should have authorityto authorise the signature of a supplementary Agreement as soon asit appears that satisfactory termshave been arranged.
THE NEW GUNARDLINER.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(S3), Con-clusion 19.)4-2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer brought up thequestion of the proposed continuation of the largeCunard liner in order that he might consult hiscolleagues as to their willingness for him tocontinue negotiations during the Recess on certainlines.   Up to now the negotiations had been tedious,and agreement had not yet been reached between the cunard and White Star Companies.    Some of the diffi-culties, however, had been eliminated.   The cunard company had now agreed that a new Company should be formed to operate the Atlantic trade.   The divisionof shares between the operating Companies had not yetbeen decided.    He was holding a meeting that veryafternoon to try and reach an arrangement.    It was proposed that the shareholders should surrendercertain shares and take instead shares in the new-operating Company.    The question then arose as towhat form the assistance by the Government shouldtake and what terms they should make.   Before explain-ing this the Chancellor said that he did not proposethat the Government should help towards the construc-tion of a second ship, bmt only the ship already begun, on which  1,700,000 had already been spentand  2,800,000 remained, making  4,500,000 in all.Incidentally he mentioned that the correspondingFrench ship was to cost  9,000,000.    As to theprospect of the ship becoming a paying proposition,Lord Essenden, who had been rather an opponent ofthe policy of building these giant ships and stillthought it better to build three medium-size ratherthan two mammoth ships, considered that the shipwould pay and win a sufficient traffic from theGermans for this, purpose.
If he followed the ordinary course, any government assistance would he a first charge on the propertyof the operating Company.    It was impossible, however,to insist on those terms,  owing to the conditions governing some categories of the shares in the parentCompanies.   Negotiations had not yet begun, but hisown view was that the only plan was for the Governmentto accept the position under which a portion of thecharges would be taken over in the form not ofdebentures but corresponding to the charges, the twofirms would have on the profits of the operatingCompany:    that is to say, what he would call &quot;incomedebentures&quot;   a somewhat vague term to which differentmeanings sometimes attached.   This meant that theGovernment would not have a prior charge on the assets or profits of the operating Company, but wouldstipulate for a prime charge of, say, %%y and forthe rest would share with the ordinary shareholders.mhe Company,  of course, would like to fix. the charge on the liner only, but he thought the Governmentwould have to spread it over the whole of theoperations of the Company.    He did not think theycould get a mortgage over the whole assets of theCompany, so he asked the Cabinet to allow him tonegotiate on the terms he proposed.    In reply to thePrime Minister he made clear that the Government wouldhave no responsibility for the operation of the Company,The President of the Board of Trade said that, hisown view had veered considerably since the original proposals .   At first he had thought that the general idea would be to enable the ship to be proceeded withby simple agreements which put the matter almost on a business basis.   The conditions proposed by LordWeir, however, could not be complied with, and considerable changes had been incorporated in the-4-
proposals now put forward.    The last suggestion put us in the position of being an equity-holder.   Thiswas an objectionable position for a Government,especiallyin a trade of such uncertain prospects as the Atlanticshipping business.    He was somewhat surprised to hearof Lord Essenden&apos;s confidence that a profit could bemade in a traffic where the total number of passengerswas so limited.    In order to make the ship pay itwould be necessary to earn a profit of  450,000 ayear after all charges,  in order to pay a reasonablerate of interest:    that is to say, there must be a net profit of  18,000 a voyage.   With the trade on itspresent basis he saw no prospect of this, which madehim apprehensive of any arrangement on the basisproposed.    It was dangerous, he thought, for aGovernment ^o go forward with two Companies only inso precarious a business as the North Atlantic Shippingtrade,   There were lots of other branches of shippingwhich needed assistance.    South American shipping was just holding its own, but was subject to heavy compe-tition.     The British Indian trade was vital.   Theshipping trade to Australia and the Par East was all of the greatest importance.   He presumed that we shoxildnot contemplate extending shipping to them also.   Hewas not sure whether the Chancellor of the Exchequerhimself approved the scheme as yet.   He rather though this attitude was one of considering it.   He hoped,therefore, that he would take into consideration allthese factors.    Sir Percy Bates, the Chairman of the cunard Steamship Company, maintained that a steadytraffic, such as was maintained by the Germans, was essential to success.    This involved two ships.Consequently when No, 554 was completed, very soona good case would be made out for No.535, and theGovernment would ultimately become involved in a
further  4,500,000.    Sir Percy Bates had said thatif agreement could be made on a commercial basis hewould be able to obtain the rest of the money bythe issue of Bills by the Company.    Referring tothe employment aspect, the President of the Board ofTrade said that some 3,500 men would be employed foreighteen months or two years .    If  2,800,000 wereto be laid out now and  4,500,000 later on, hethought that a better way could be found of employingthese funds.    The Government would be accused of assisting in the construction of a floating&quot;DorchesterHotel&quot;.   All these matters were serious;    but whatreally was uppermost in his mind was that no seafaringnation except the Scandinavians, was willing to agreeto stop shipping subsidies.    It would be better to&quot;devote the money to lines serving an Imperial interestrather than a mere luxury traffic.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring to thesuggestion that this was an equitjr holding, said the proposal had not come from Sir Percy Bates norLord Essenden;    it was the Treasury who had suggestedthat the difficulties should be faced in this way,because they could not see how, otherwise, the scheme could be got through at all.    As to financing byBills, he understood that this was still in the mind of the Cunard Company, but if they had the Governmentbehind them it would make all the difference, forthat meant,  in effect, that the Government guaranteedthe Bills and no difficulty would arise as tosubsidy it was a security..    If this was a/shipbuilding and not ashipping subsidy. He agreed the Government might beasked to finance a second ship and it might bedifficult to refuse, but he was not proposing to commit the Government to more than one ship.
It was conceivable that if the first ship were a success, the second, ship might be financed without government aid.    He had no idea of financing shipping in all parts of the world, but he had understood thatthe Blue Riband of the Atlantic was in a position by itself, and a great deal of public attention hadbeen concentrated on this particular ship.    EvenLord Essenden agreed that the prestige- of british shipping was bound up wrlth our possession of a ship of this kind.    He also thought that a single shipwould form a unit.    Having gone as far as they had,he thought it would be very difficult for the Govern-ment to announce that they would give no assistance.In the subsequent discussion the question was raised as to why, if the prospects  of the ship were so good, the money could not be raised in the market.The reply was that the Company would have to pay agood deal more for the money and that the cunard company had lost  900,000 last year, which did notfacilitate raising fresh capital.    It was suggestedthat other countries which were unwilling at present to give up subsidies were more likely to come to some arrangement if they realised, that the British Govern-ment was backing the construction of this ship.In this connection it was mentioned, that when theship had been laid down. Sir Thomas Royden had ascertained from some of the Continental Companiesthat they did not object to the construction of thisship as they considered it Great Britain&apos;s turn, andthat when these ships were built they themselves wouldstabilise for some years.    The proposal was stronglywelcomed from the Naval point of view of stimulating the shipbuilding industry, and from that of employmentin Scotland.    The Cabinet were reminded, however,
that the construction of many other large ships washeld up, including a 1.000 ft. ship at Harland andWolffs.The President of the Board of Trade asked thathis views might be summarised in full as above, andthe Secretary of State for War associated himself withthe President of the Board of Trade.    He did notbelieve in the construction of these great ships forcompetition in the Atlantic, where there were alreadytoo many ships for the passengers available.   Theycould not earn money in these circumstances,    It waswreng to build extreme luxury trade ships at a timewhen conditions in America meant that the number ofluxury passengers was being diminished.mhe Prime Minister thought that the view of theCabinet was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldbe allowed to go on with his negotiations during theRecessy on the assumption that his proposals were accepted in principle and that he should, report theresult of his negotiations to the Cabinet for consider-atxon.The Cabinet agreed in the PrimeMinisterTs summing-up, and instructed the Secretary to the.Cabinet to make afull record of the discussion.
