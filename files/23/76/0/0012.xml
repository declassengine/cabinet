THE british war DEBT TOTHE UNITEDSTATES .(previous reference:Cabinet 39(33), Con-conclusion ion 2 .)The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that,the Committee on War Debts had met early the same evening and had decided that the circumstances were such that the Cabinet ought to meet the same night,and that was his reason for summoning this emergencyMeeting.   The present position was that, so far asinformation was as yet available, President Rooseveltappeared not to feel able to issue an exoneratingstatement that would comply with the conditions decided on by the Cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin as justification for an offer of a token paymentof 5,000,000 Dollars..   If those conditions had been complied with, the Cabinet Committee had been willingto consider a recommendation to the Cabinet that theamount of the payment should be advanced to 10,000,000Dollars .    It appeared doubtful, however, whether10,000,000 Dollars would produce the certificate fromthe President complying with the CabineVs conditions.At the time when the Cabinet Committee had metearlier in the day it had been understood that atelegram would have been received at about 8 p.m.clearing the matter up definitely.    It had been hopedthat the telegram could have been deciphered by thepresent hour.   As a matter of fact, however, thattelegram had not yet arrived.   If the telegram shouldconfirm the position as at present indicated, theUabinet would have to decide whether to pay or not topay.   He thought, however, that it wotild be better not to settle the question that evening, and to holdanother Meeting in the morning.The Chancellor of the Exchequer Said that theposition was not yet quite clear.   The Presidentappeared to have boggled over the word &quot;any&quot;, whichwas used in a paragraph of one of the telegrams to
Sir Ronald Lindsay (No. 301, of June 11th)  (See appendix i to the following Meeting. Cabinet 41 (33)) ,   As amatter of fact the word &quot;any&quot; appeared twice in thesame paragraph, viz.:-&quot;We should like the President to make acontemporary declaration that hepersonally did not regard theUnitedStates of America as in the presenceof any default&quot;:and again,&quot;The Cabinet will not agree to any payment unless we can thereby obtain some quite specific and authoritative moralindemnity from the President&quot;.It was not quite clear why importance was attached tothe word &quot;any&quot;.   The telegram which was awaited should give the exact text of the draft statement the president would be prepared to make if the Cabinet decided to stand by the draft note contained in telegram No.302to Sir R. Lindsay of June 11th (See Appendix II to thefollowing Meeting, Cabinet 41 (33)).   Until the text of the Presidents statement was available it was difficult to take a decision.   It was clear that thesituation at Washington had become more difficult,largely owing to the fact that the President had not succeeded in securing the adjournment of Congress.What made the situation particularly awkward was thathe himself was due to make a statement in the House ofCorrraons on the following day and it would be difficultto postpone it.The Prime Minister gave some explanations that hehad received from Mr Cordell Hull, the principalAmerican Delegate at the Monetary and Economic Confer-ence, as to the Congress situation.After some further discussion, the Cabinet agreed -To meet at 10, Downing Street thefollowing morning at 9 a.m.(NOTE:    Just before the adjournment of the Cabinet news was
received from the Foreign office that a message was beginning tocome in from Washington.   As the message, however, would probablybe in cipher, and would in that event not be available for an hour or two, it was decided to adhere to the above decision.)* .  *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 12, 1933.
