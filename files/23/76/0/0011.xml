EDUCTION ANDTWIT AT ION OPVtENTS .(previous reference:Cabinet 38(33), Con-conclusion 3.)1. The Secretary of State for Air reported onconversations that he and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had had on theprevious day in Paris with M. Daladier, M. Paul-Boncourand Mr Norman Davis.   The conversations were dtie toan initiative taken by Mr Norman Davis and had lastedfrom 10-30 a.m. to 5 p.m.    In view of the important matters awaiting consideration by the Cabinet on other items of the Agenda the Secretary of State only gave a brief summary.   He promised to circulate a full report .   One point which had impressed both. Mr Edenand himself was that the French Government had nowrather receded from their previous insistence on&quot;Security&quot; and were placing emphasis on &quot;Supervision&quot;.At Geneva they had suggested numerous amendments tothe supervieion clauses of the British Draft Convention.At Paris M. Daladier had insisted strongly that &quot;nosupervision could be too rigorous&quot;.   He and Mr Edenhad listened to these proposals, and after suggesting that the French plans went further than we had hitherto contemplated, had pressed the French to say what theywould do in return.    In asking for this they had pointed, out that we had already made a great manyconcessions to the French point of view.   The british representatives had insisted strongly on the importanceof securing a successful result to the DisarmamentConference.   They gathered that this was alsoM. Daladier&apos;s view.   They could not tell, however,how far that represented the view of his colleagues,and M. Daladier had reserved for discussion with hiscolleagues the question of what France could give inreturn.   M. Daladier had admitted that he had learneda good deal in the last 24 hours .   They had obtained the impression that M. Daladierfs idea was that-1-
tp^ft^U-ltS] idealistsupervision should start at once from the moment ofits adoption, and that when it had proved itselfeffective, disarmament should take place.   The british representatives had pointed out that the Germans hadbeen induced to make many concessions and had usedthis as an argument for urging that the French should indicate what concessions they would make.   The Frenchidea appeared to be that there would not be muchdisarmament for the first three years, but that after that they would reduce their material as compensationfor the alteration in the conditions of the GermanReichswehr.   That was the only concession they hadbeen able to obtain from the French, who at first had indicated that they would wish to await the resultsof the working of the supervision arrangements.   on what he would call the &quot;service&quot; questions, some differences of opinion existed, but they did not appearvery serious.   So far as the Reichswehr were concerned the French had suggested that at a certain point theGermans would be at their peak strength and the Frenchat their minimum.   They were obviously nervous of theGerman strength.   Whether the French would implement their concession he was not prepared to say, but hethought that they had got them to the point that theywould say what they were prepared to do after thethree years.   Lord Londonderry paid a tribute to theway Mr Eden had stated the various points.   Generallyspeaking, the conversations had produced evidence ofa French desire for success on material rather thanic grounds.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for, Foreign Affairs added that the importance the FrenchI   attached to supervision was due to tfee*-^e4 thatGermany was re-arming so much. 7 he evidence in thisrespect was so strong that i&amp;^fe4re^-e^enAe*i-^-f-4tee-&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; S
flteonoft. &apos;Mlnjttit.ogo no-one -would ask Prance to do verymuch in the way of disarmament.    They had mentioned,for example, that they had definite information of1    cz^vJD oa^iIs&quot;&quot;&quot;] concrete emplacements being constructed in the Blacknfc. WForest.   The French also thought./that it would beiLlvl Hzl *---hl-*^journey^-r useless for the Disarmament Conference to meet ina    ylwAf-i^ ^ reply to a question from the Prime Minister as topub lie I unAAlwJth^s&quot;e*^q^ .    in what was contemplated during the adjournment of theDisarmament Conference, he said that Mr arthur henderson had announced his intention of coming backto London from Geneva and hoped for an opportunityof conversations with some of the Prime ministers present in London at the Monetary and Economic Confer-ence.The Secretary of State for Air added that theyhad pressed the French representatives for earlyconstiltat ion with their colleagues .The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reminded the Cabinet that the question of disarmamentwould be raised in Debate on Tuesday next.   He thought the Debate should be allowed to take place,  after which contact should be established with Mr Henderson.The Prime Minister entered a caveat that the workof the Monetary and&apos; Economic Conference was likely tobe so heavy that Prime Ministers and Foreign ministers might not find much time for serious conversations on disarmament.Some discussion took place as to the forthcoming debate, in which, judging from correspondence in thePress, it appeared probable that bombing from the airwould be the main point raised.    On this point therewas strong evidence of an active propaganda.   Therewas general agreement that the right course was not to
confine the reply to the defence of Police bombing,but,  in addition, to widen the front of the Debate;to make clear that we had saved the DisarmamentConference again and again from failure;    to bring out that It was the major differences between france and  Germany that were holding up the Conference; andthat, compared with these, the question of PoliceBombing was a side issue.Mr Eden was asked to repeat in the House ofCommons a statement he made to the Cabinet that itwas &quot;fantastic to suggest that the question ofbomtTing^was&quot;&quot; holding up the Conference&quot;,The conclusions of the Cabinet may be summed upas follows:-(a) To take note that the proces-verbalof the conversations in Paris wouldbe circulated to the Cabinet, whowould have an opportunity of raisingany point arising therefrom:(b) That the Debate on Disarmament shouldtake place on Tuesday next, after which the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should get in touchwith Mr Arthur Henderson:(c) That in Tuesday&apos;s Debate the Secretaryof State and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should adopt the line as to bombingindicated above.(Mr Eden withdrew at thispoint.)

THE monetary and ECONOMICCONFERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(33), Con-elusion 7.)fx3, The Cabinet took note of an account,circulated by the Secretary by direction of thePrime Minister, of a conversation between thePrime Minister and the Secretary-General of the monetary and Economic Conference on procedure atthe Conference (CP.-153 (33)).The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatplaces would be reserved for Cabinet Ministers whowere not members of the Conference.   He wished toknow, however, which members of the Cabinet wouldnot be able to use their tickets, as the number of places was extremely limited.The following Ministers indicated that theywould not be able to attend the Opening Meeting:-The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board of Education.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs stated that he had made arrangements for a meeting with the Delegates of the Dominions at the monetary and Economic Conference to take place on Monday,June 12th, at 10-30 a.m.    Officials had not been invited.   He did not anticipate the meeting wouldlast more than an hour and a quarter .   He thought it important that the Dominions representatives shouldnot be encouraged to assume that this was the first of a series of meetings.   In this respect it wouldbe desirable to be gviided by circumstances .

kjsTjsECRETiBRITISH WAR DEBT TO THE UNITED STATES.Addendum to Cabinet 59 (35) conclusion^,,^-k BRITISHm DEBT TOp UNITED(NOTE;    By instructions from the Cabinetthe following note of the Cabinet&apos;discussion on War Debts is notreceiving general circulation andis retained in a sealed copy (solong as need for the utmost secrecyremains) in the Secretary&apos;s standard file.     A copy of the record asfinally approved has been sent tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,)As no Papers had been circulated, THE CHANCELLOROF THE EXCHEQUER summarised the situation on War Debts forthe benefit of his colleagues.      He recalled that up to ashort time ago we had reason to hope that the Presidentof the United States of America would send a message to congress asking for an authority that he could use for thepurposes of a moratorium on June 15th.     Although, judgingfrom Press reports, the situation had been deteriorating,up to quite recently Sir Ronald Lindsay had held outexpectations that all would come right before the day of payment.      We had been led. to suppose that if the mood of congress was too intractable President Roosevelt wouldtell them that he intended to regard a failure to paysimply as a non-payment and not as a default.      Then ahint had been given by Mr. Moley that a part-payment wouldbe accepted in lieu of the whole.      The Prime minister had then written a private letter to President Rooseveltexplaining the objections to this course.     This had crossed a communication from President Roosevelt suggesting)that we should offer a part-payment and indicating^10,000,000 Dollars as the appropriate sum.      Sir Ronald
Lindsay had told Mr. Moley that the Prime Minister&apos;communication provided the reply to Mr. Roosevelt&apos;suggestion.     Mr. Moley had explained that the situation had now deteriorated and that Congress would not receivein silence a message such as had previously &quot;been con-templated.      He had come back to the proposal for an interim part-payment.      Mr. Phillips, the AmericanAssistant Secretary of State, and Mr. Moley had told the ambassador that the President could not make thisproposal officially and that it would have to come fromthis side.      They had indicated that Congress was likelyto adjourn by June 10th, but this was now doubtful.Their proposal was that immediately after the adjourn-ment His Majesty&apos;s Government should themselves suggest a part-payment, and they had enclosed a memorandumdeveloping this idea.     We were to plead poverty as an excuse and say that we could not pay more than10,000,000 Dollars.      They would then offer to acceptpayment in silver.      Sir Ronald Lindsay had pointed outthat 10,000,000 Dollars was in excess of the sum coveredby the Lausanne Agreements.      He had also raised theconstitutional position and had suggested that a part-  .payment would not be accepted by Congress, who would say;that they did not agree with the President and declareus in default.      At this point Mr. Phillips had left theroom, but Mr. Moley had indicated that he shared SirRonald Lindsay&apos;s doubts on the constitutional positionand wanted to consult the Chief Justice.      He had in-dicated further that he was&apos; uncertain whether congress would adjourn on June 10th,      Sir Ronald Lindsay had then asked for an interview with the President.      a record of this interview had now arrived, and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer summarised the reply, withcopious extracts.      (The text of the telegram is attached inAppendix I.)      It will he noticed that the general effect ofthe telegram is to confirm the American position as indi-cated above, namely, that importance was attached to a part-payment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then stated that hehad received a communication from the French Government,through M. Rueff, expressing views against any payment beingmade to the United States of America and holding that it was essential that the Creditor Powers that were parties to the lausanne Agreement should hold together on the basis of the lausanne settlement.      He read extracts from an interviewthat Sir Frederick Leith-Ross had had with M. Rueff(Appendix II).The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that hehad not had an opportunity to discuss the latest developmentswith the Prime Minister.      Prior to these developments thePrime Minister had drafted a Note, but he thought that theselatest developments would, involve some modifications in thedraft.     He had accordingly made a re-draft himself, which,however, he had not had an opportunity to discuss with thePrime Minister.(The Secretary handed round copies of theChancellor&apos;s re-draft  - Appendix III.)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr.Roosevelt was still talking of discussions between the UnitedKingdom and the United States of America without the other powers.      He felt that in the spirit of the Lausanne Agree-ments it was necessary that the debtors to America should keep in touch with one another.      It was impossible to escape the dilemma that we must either pay in full or default.      ThePresident&apos;s own advice to us was that we should offer a part-payment, which he suggested should amount to 10,000,000Dollars.      We had paid the instalment due in december last in order to preserve ourselves from default, butthat payment had not done us much good, as Congress-3-
appeared more obdurate than ever.    If we paid 10,000,000Dollars now there was no reason why we should not toe -asiied to pay the same again next December, and twopayments of 10,000,000 Dollars would amount to a bigfigure in one year.    If we made this payment it would tend to break up the Lausanne Agreements,  since under those Agreements we could not obtain so much from ourown creditors:    that is to say, we should have to askmore from our creditors than was provided for in the lausanne settlement.    The payment, therefore, wouldhave to be of such an order as we could take on our ownshoulders.    A part-payment on account of the Juneinstalment would, in his opinion, be a mistake, but a token payment, as a recognition of the legal position,might be regarded in a different light.    He felt thatit was difficult to take no notice of president roosevelt&apos;s interview with Sir Ronald Lindsay, since this might antagonise him and create a bad impression in his mind.    His own suggestion would be to offer not10,000,000 Dollars, but 10,000,000 ounces of silver.One advantage of this would be that a payment in silverwould emphasise its nature as a token payment.    Further,10,000,000 ounces of silver represented only 5,000,000Dollars.    Such an offer, however, could only be made if we obtained first from the President an undertaking that he would accept it as a token payment.    In replyto the Foreign Secretary, he said that in his view thePresident could hardly meet it with a negative, as theproposal was not very different from his own.    His ideawould be to forward the proposal to Sir Ronald Lindsayto show to the President in confidence.    If the Presidentdid refuse it he would have to indicate some alternative.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggestedthat this was in effect a payment on account.    He thought
that the world at large would not understand what wasmeant by a &quot;token payment&quot;.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER explained and emphasised that a token payment would not be on accountoi&quot; the June instalment, but part of a final settlement.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thaton a hasty reading of the Note in Appendix III it seemed to him that all the arguments were againstpayment.    Then in paragraph 10 a suggestion was madefor a token payment.    Would this, he asked, reallyimprove the position?   The arguments against further payments had been set out very effectively in the note of last December.    Today, however, we were no further than we had been then.    As the Prime Minister&apos;s visitreceded,  the President,  instead of becoming more flexible, appeared to be hardening.    If any paymentwere made snort of the total, the temper oi&quot; congress would rise.    It was true that token payments might be recovered in part by payments from our debtors underthe Lausanne   Agreements, but last December&apos;s payment hadreally produced no result.    Our experience at Lausannehad been that we would have had no settlement if germany had not made it quite clear that she would not pay anyfurther large sum.    That fact alone had enabled anAgreement to be reached.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER explained thathis Note had had to be very hastily drafted.    The real question at issue was whether the Cabinet was preparedto pay the June instalment or not.    The only object ofa token payment was to avoid a flat refusal.    He wished the Cabinet to know that he had had no opportunity todiscuss the matter with the Governor of the Bank ofEngland,  but his impression was that the Governor would prefer to pay, though perhaps not very convincedly.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that He recognised that the President of the Boardof Trade&apos;s Memorandum CP.-134 (33) was a very formidabledocument and contained strong arguments against making any payment.    He asked, however, whether a repudiationwould stop at that point.    Taking the case of the IrishFree State, for example, their case was admittedlytotally different from that of War Debts, but it wouldbe impossible to get this recognised in the Free State.He recalled that not long ago the Cabinet had had togive assistance to Newfoundland on a fifty-fifty basis with Canada in order to avoid repudiation.     Australiawanted, though unjustly, to place the responsibilitylor their inability to fund their debt on this country.These factors pointed to the danger of default.Consequently, while recognising that the United states had let down both this country and its Prime Minister,he thought that the reactions of default, not only onGovernments but also on individuals, ought to be most seriously considered.    He asked, therefore, if theChancellor of the Exchequer was not right in proposingby whatever means to avoid the consequences of a default?THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not had timeto consider the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s conclusions.The line he had been working on up to now had been thatwe should claim the June payment to be part of the wholesettlement which was actually under consideration, sothat there was no object in paying this part of thewhole.    Non-payment in those circumstances could not betreated as a default.    His idea had been to say that we wanted a comprehensive settlement and were prepared tocome to an agreement without delay and without even theneed for a token payment.    President Roosevelt had indicated to the Prime Minister that he would not regard-b-
non-payment in such circumstances as a default, and heread extracts from Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s telegram No.381-382 (Appendix I) to show that he would not so regard it.      Apparently the idea of a token or part payment wasthat it should he large enough to influence publicopinion in America, and President Roosevelt appeared tothink that 10,000,000 Dollars would suffice and 5,000,000would not.      He asked, however, whether by a token paymentwe gained anything at all?      If we paid either 5,000,000or 10,000,000 Dollars could we do it without tellingthe French?      The line he himself had taken with president roosevelt was that if we made a part-payment we shouldhave to ask our Allies to make an equivalent payment tous.      He did not much like the mention of silver.      Assomeone had interjected when the Chancellor had mentionedsilver just now, the word &quot;Judas&quot; was likely to come intopeople&apos;s minds.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought thatto a nation with such strong Biblical knowledge payment in silver would be regarded as a grim jest.THE PRIME MINISTER felt, on the whole, that payment in silver was not sufficiently dignified andthat it would be better to pay in Dollars.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE asked whether any halfway-house between full payment or no payment waspossible.        Many people thought that the Americans haddealt us a heavy blow by abrogation of the gold clause,and undoubtedly this hit hard British creditors of american debtors.      That alone was sufficient reason foropening the whole question.      What he objected to mainlywas, however,  a payment which left us in the exactposition that we were in last December, did nothing to alleviate the situation, and did not even avoid legalrepudiation.      He did not agree with the Newfoundland
parallel , since in that case it had not been a questionof repudiation but of charity.      As to the Irish FreeState, they would accuse us of repudiation if we did not pay the whole instalment.        In these circumstances hethought that anything short of payment of the fullinstalment would be termed repudiation.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR recalled that hehad been opposed to payment last December, and he took the same view today that we ought not to pay.    In sayingthis he fully realised that default was a very serious matter.      Nevertheless, it was impossible for us to go onpaying for ever.      Consequently, unless we had some reasonto believe that we could get a complete settlement  which he had no reason to suppose was at present thecase   we had better make up our minds today insteadof six or twelve months later when we should have paid out further money.      He did not deny that this might beused as a precedent, by other countries, but he thoughtthat those countries would be influenced mainly by thequestion of the effect on themselves of repudiation.As to the question of a token payment, it would be a default legally if we were to offer 10,000,000 ounces of silver in lieu of the total sum due.      It would be much better to say frankly that on practical grounds we hadan unanswerable case and that we did not feel justifiedin paying at a moment when an Economic Conference was meeting on which the recovery of the world depended.    Ifwe made a payment now we should have to ask for an equivalent token payment from our debtors.    Perhaps then it would be better to say that we did not intend to paybut that we were ready to negotiate at once and would be willing to meet the Americans anywhere that the Presidentwished for this purpose.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR pointed out that we owed alarge capital sum, as well as a recurring sum for interest.      Why, he asked, should we not negotiate for&quot;both the capital sum and the recurring sum at the sametime?THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed outthat this was what was now proposed.      The only reasonhe had suggested a token payment was because thePresident had proposed it and he had thought it mightbe considered rather serious to reject the proposal.Many people would say that we were defaulting for thefirst time.      If we could reply &quot;That is true, but we did it with the assent of the Head of the AmericanGovernment&quot; their objections would be mitigated.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSassumed that we should only make this arrangement on condition that the President would say publicly thatit would not be regarded as a default.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thatnevertheless the leader-writers would declare it a default.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that the question should be put to president roosevelt in some such manner as the foilowing:-&quot;Will you state publicly, in reply, that in youropinion this is not a default and will not be soregarded?&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said he had discussed this with Mr Roosevelt, who had said that he would not regard it as a default or treat us as a defaulter.      It wouldbe necessary for him to accept this proposal and not topress us for further payment in June.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR suggested thatthe President was more likely to content himself with anacknowledgment and a &quot;take-note&quot; of our view.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that thiswould not he enough.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR suggested that more shouldhe made of paragraph 10 of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;draft (Appendix III) , where it was stated &quot;that payment ofthe June instalment would gravely imperil the success of theConference&quot;.      If this statement was correct it would hevery wrong to make a payment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that that position had beenvery carefully considered.      He felt it was essential to mention the Conference as a factor in the case, but not to -build too much on it.      The President was only asking for a nominal payment, and, as indicated on page 3 of Sir RonaldlatestLindsay&apos;s/telegram, would not treat us as a defaulter if we did not pay at all.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES thoughtthat this latter point was the most important in the telegram.      He thought that the general public here would regard the transaction as an odd one and take it badly.Probably most people did not wish to pay.      Those who onhigh moral grounds thought that we ought to pay would notbe satisfied with a token payment.      Congress would say thatwe had defaulted.THE PRIME MINISTER then read the following extractfrom the concluding passage of his original draft(which hasnot been circulated):-&quot;For that and other&apos;reasons which have beenrepeatedly stated, it appears to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the successful pursuit of thepolicy which the two Governments desire to promotewould be gravely imperilled if the question of aninstalment upon a debt obligation were thrust as adisturbing political and economic factor into thework now being done for world recovery.
The position as His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsees it at the present moment is:-1.  We are engaged in examining proposals fora final and comprehensive settlement of the debtproblem which in the nature of things cannot be delayed;2.   In that settlement the December payment and the June obligations are being included;3.  A payment now made, without taking intoaccount familiar arguments upon its effect on general world economy,   (a) will raise issues whichhad better be settled once and for all inconnection with an immediate general settlement;and (b) cannot be confined to arrangements betweenthe United States and ourselves but must have serious reactions on existing conditional and temporary agreements between all debtor andcreditor States;    it must, whilst yielding no substantial benefit to the United States, be avery disturbing element in world economic andpolitical conditions.His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore press uponthe United States Government to allow the Junepayments to be regarded as part of the general debtquestion already under consideration by both governments with a view to being comprehensivelysettled at an early date&quot;.Since that draft had been prepared, new papers had arrived,&quot;and he agreed that they necessitated some reconsideration,which, however, might take the form of an addition ratherthan an alteration.      He thought that something might beadded in regard to the token payment.      He thought it essential that we should present our case for non-payment, andthat it was impossible event to make a token payment withoutdrawing attention to the fact that we were involved in negotiations on the very matter on which we were asked to pay.The demand for a token payment only indicated want of trust inour credit.      The real point, however, was that the wholequestion was actually under negotiation.&apos;..   THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR    strongly supported this point of view.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that the only
important point was as to whether by a token payment wecould get the quittance we required against accusation ofdefault on the June payment.THE LORD PRESIDENT Off THE COUNCIL proposed that theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal for a token payment of5,000,000 dollars (but not paid in silver)  should be submittedto the President.      If Mr.  Roosevelt did not consider itsatisfactory we should fall back on the Prime Minister&apos;s draftPossibly it might be found feasible to wed the two.      It might even be possible to allow Sir Ronald Lindsay to show bothdocuments to the President.      He did not conceal, however,  thahe saw great dangers in not paying.(The Lord President of the Councilwithdrew at :.this point&apos;.to...keep an&quot;official engagement out of London.)THE PRIME MINISTER felt that he could get Mr.Roosevelt to agree to his proposal if he were with him, butthedifficulty was the distance of 3,000 miles.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH was impressed by theimportance of avoiding the prospect of a default, andplansuggested that the Prime Minister&apos;s/should be. tried first andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s plan kept in reserve.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out thatthere was now no time for negotiation, as presumably some statement would have to be made in the House of Commons on tuesday.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs suggested that the two proposals might be blended.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION recalled that in December he had been in favour of not withholdingpayment,  in order to give time to educate public opinion.Unfortunately no effect had been produced on Congress, buthe thought that world opinion had been educated.      The main issue was the choice between paying and withholdingpayment on June 15th.      He saw no difficulty now
in the choice, as if we paid there seemed no reason, why we should not go on paying indefinitely.      The only question at issue then was whether a token paymentshould he made.      He gathered that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer&apos;s object in a token payment was the psychological effect on the mind of the President.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER interpolatedthat what he really wanted was a certificate of goodintention from the President.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION,continuing, said, that if we could obtain that he wouldbe in favour of a token payment;    otherwise he would fall back on the lines of the Prime Minister&apos;s Note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs read a draft telegram to Sir Ronald Lindsay setting outthe points on which we should require a public announce-ment by the President if we made a token payment.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he attachedno special importance to the proposal to pay in silver.He had only proposed it because the suggestion hademanated from the Americans themselves.      Moreover,Mr Roosevelt appeared to think that the figure of10,000,000 would impress American public opinion and5,000,000 would not.      10,000,000 ounces of silver wasthe equivalent of 5,000,000 Dollars of gold.      If thepayment were to be made in silver, time would berequired.THE PRIME MINISTER was anxious that his colleagues should not take a wrong view of what was in the President^mind. Probably anyone in his position would have to takethe same line.    He had kept Congress rather too long  against which the Prime Minister himself had warned him.He thought that if the token payment was to be madethe President would have to be willing to announce that
it&quot;was accepted under the circumstances and he did not regard it as a default&quot;.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought ittremendously important to obtain some such statement.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that to offer morethan 5,000,000 Dollars would be a great mistake fromthe point of view of the House of Commons.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE pointed outthat 5,000,000 Dollars would not keep the Hearst Pressquiet.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but pointed out thatthe great change in American public opinion must not be under-rated.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA suggested thatthe Cabinet should agree to make an inquiry as to   whethera token payment of 5,000,000 Dollars would be acceptedby the President, with a public declaration that in hisopinion it was not a default.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER asked whetherthe Cabinet were agreed that, if the worst came to the worst, we should not pay?There was general agreement to this effect and no dissent was made.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in these circum-stances we must fall back on our Note if the president would not do what we wanted in reply to an offer of a token payment.      If silver was to be mentioned it shouldbe put in the form that His Majesty&apos;s Government under-stand that the American Government prefer a payment insilver to a payment in gold.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought it unnecessary to say whether the payment was to be ingold or in paper.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE pointedout that paper dollars were cheaper to buy.The decision of the Cabinet, as summed up bythe Prime Minister, was as follows :-(l)      That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send a message to Sir RonaldLindsay reporting the result of the cabinet discussion.    He should point out that any payment now would involve us in   veryconsiderable difficulties at home, butwe might be prepared to make a tokenpayment of 5,000,000 Dollars, to be takeninto account, together with the paymentlast December, in the final settlementif the President could give us an assurance that in acknowledging this payment he wouldnot only make the three following declara-tions already proposed, viz. :-(a) He would acknowledge receipt:(b) Put on record His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsstatement of reasons:(c) Express his willingness to negotiate atWashington for a final settlement.but,  in addition, give us an assurance -(d) that in his opinion such payment was acceptable in the circumstances;    and(e) that in view of our having made itwe ought not to be regarded as indefault.(A copy of the telegraph as actuallydespatched is attached in Appendix IV&quot;).(S)      That, failing acceptance of this offer by president Roosevelt, we should fall backon the proposal in the Prime Minister&apos;draft Note quoted above  (marked &quot;A&quot;):(3)      That the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inreply to a request from M. Rueff forinformation as to the Cabinet&apos;s decision,for the secret information of the FrenchGovernment, should state that the question was still under consideration by the cabinet and that enquiries by the Press should be answered to the same effect:(4)      That it was most important that the utmostsecrecy should be observed., Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 9, 1933.
APPENDIX    I.Copy of Telegrams (Nqs. 581 and 582) fromSir R. Lindsay, Washington, dated 8thJune. 1935.IMMEDIATE.SECRET.1. I saw the President this afternoon.     I said Iwished to urge him once more to send a message to Congressrecommending a moratorium and was It quite impossible for him to do this.     He said a fortnight ago he had confidentlyexpected to send such a message and had in his box a first draft which he had prepared.     His letter to the PrimeMinister and his messages to me through Moley had reflectedthis conviction.     Since then however a very serious deterioration had taken place in the Congress situation andit was absolutely impossible now to send any such message.In the temper of Congress at this moment such action might provoke them to pass every kind of legislation, mischievousnot only to the United States but even to the world ingeneral.     They would probably vote enormous payments toveterans and provide for funds for meeting them by makinginflation (?measures).     He could not possibly face sucha risk as must (?grp.omtd..) this.     He had even had to drophis message on tariffs.2. I said it seemed to me that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas now in the position of either having to make a full pay-ment or having to default.     He said there was a modus Vivendiin between these two and we then proceeded to discuss thequestion of a part payment as foreshadowed to you in 364.3. I said it seemed to me a prerequisite to this scheme that Congress should have adjourned before June 15th.He said that this was not so at all and that it would not
matter if Congress was still sitting at the moment whennotes were exchanged.     He contemplated that notes regard-ing a part payment would become public immediately, huthe did not contemplate himself sending them to Congress.He thought it likely that there might be some fieryspeeches in Congress about the debt provoked by notes andpossibly an attempt to pass a resolution on the subject.If a concurrent resolution were passed, that would not,under recognised Congress procedure, be binding on theAdministration and he would pay no attention to it.     Ifa joint resolution were passed which would (grp.undoc:)him, he would not hesitate to veto it.     I asked if thiswould not put him in great difficulties with Congress buthe denied this.4. I said that by making a part payment in the manner suggested we would not be saved from being put legallyinto the position of having defaulted.     He denied thatthere would be any default.     He did not like the wordand he would not allow it to be used in such a connexion.5. I asked for more precise information as to thenature of the notes suggested and as to the procedure.On this, he said. His Majesty&apos;s Government might say anything they liked in their note.      If they were unableor unwilling to plead poverty in support of their actionin forwarding (?plea for) a part payment, then they might perhaps urge the condition of exchanges, or any other reason that seemed good to them.     Katurally the lesscontentious the British note was the better would it beand the less likely to raise difficulties.     He said thathe was quite indifferent as to whether payment profferedby His Majesty&apos;s Government were stipulated as a paymenttowards capital, towards interest, or towards anything else.     It might, he said, he offered with the stipulation
that It should he counted In towards a final settlement,and he added that he knew perfectly well that that meantnothing at all.     Note is of course an expression of our desire to undertake further negotiations towards adefinite settlement and should ask when and where these negotiations should take place.     In his answer he would,as stated In his letter to the Prime Minister of June 7thacknowledge receipt of the sum, putting on record thestatement that His Majesty&apos;s Government were making withtheir payment, and express his willingness to proceedto discussion In Washington in the course of this summer.6. I said that I did not see what His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were likely to get by making any part paymentnow.     Their legal position would at the best be a veryambiguous one and Congress would probably call themdefaulters.     fas it his intention, if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment made no part-payment now, to refuse tonegotiate with them for a final debt settlement untilthe June instalment had been paid - in fact to adopt tous the attitude he has been adopting to the French.The President emphatically denied that he had any suchintention, and said that he would negotiate anyhow.We should at least he a whole instalment in front of theFrench.     He did attach a great deal of importance to apart-payment on account now by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentbecause it would exert a great influence on publicopinion if they should do so and make the approach to negotiations (?omitted during the) forthcoming summerfar easier and still more so the acceptance of the result if any result ensued.     To this he attached a good dealof importance.7. I asked him whether they could he any firmassurance that Congress would ever agree to any remission(ill)
Their resolution now on record was quite categorical.The circumstances of the present moment, with a newPresident just come into office, and elections as far offas they ever can he, were the most favourable that couldever exist.     If nothing could Be done now, what chancewas there that anything could be done next January.     Hisanswer to this was that no such assurance could be given and no certitude could exist under the constitutionalregime of the United States with which we are all familiar,but he was looking forward to the negotiations to takeplace in the autumn on the basis of the Warburg proposal.If during the coming summer and autumn he could get to(?omitted agreement with) His Hejesty&apos;s Government he wouldnext January be able to put it to Congress with all the weight of the administrations approval behind it and congress would either have to take it or leave it.     if in the meantime the economic situation had improved anddepression was substantially removed it would be veryreasonable to expect that Congress would accept such asolution.8. I said that if His Majesty&apos;s Government were topay ten million dollars now, there seemed to me to be avery considerable chance that they would have to pay thesame again next December because Congress would not besitting.     He denied this absolutely, and said that paymentcontemplated for the present moment would not In any waycommit His Majesty&apos;s Government to any definite paymentnext December.     At that time at the worst the question would be open to negotiation again.     If in the meantime ageneral settlement of debts had been reached, it would beopen to him to say he regarded it as covering the Decemberpayment and so get over any possible difficulty of that month..
9. I referred then to the figure of ten million dollars.     The President knew the limits which were imposed on His Majesty&apos;s Government by the Lausanneagreements.     Ten million dollars would more thancover the utmost His Majesty&apos;s Government could expectfrom the Lausanne situation in one year on paper andit wo\ild he extremely difficult for them to make a payment of that sum as covering what was due for sixmonths only.     Making it clear I was speaking withoutany authority, I said it might be easier for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to do something if only fivemillion dollars were required instead of ten million dollars.     To this his answer was that he had fixed on sum of ten million rather empirically and he wasnot disposed to dictate to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwhat they should offer.     He himself did not much carewhether it was ten or five.     But he had had a verydistinct object in view, viz to strike public opinion and create a favourable impression by part payment, hethought $10,000,000 would achieve this;   hut he did nothonestly think any leader writer in a newspaper could possibly regard a payment of $5,000,000 as anythingimpressive or could write with any sort of enthusiasmabout such a sum.10. I thanked the President for speaking to me sofrankly and said I would report his language to you.i could not feel very sanguine of the results.     It was more and more evident that Great Britain would getpractically no payments from her debtors or fromGermany, and here he was now asking us to pay$10,GOG,000 and the Warburg scheme, which he waslooking upon as a basis of a final settlement, wouldrequire a payment of not less than $20,000,000 a year(iv)
Illfor many years.11. The whole conversation was carried on in themost friendly tone and the President, in spite of hislabours, is extraordinarily fresh and vigorous.There was nothing vague or indefinite in what he saidthough there are plenty of contradictions.     Hisanswers came very crisply and deeisively and without anydesitation at all, so much so that 1 could not helpwondering sometimes if they were brilliant improvisations.Yet he was always so very much on the spot that I had noimpression either that he was not fully conscious ofwhat he was saying or that he would be likely to forgethis words.
APPENDIX IIThe Chancellor of the Exchequer. .Monsieur Rueff asked to see me late on 8thJune.    He said that he had instructions from the french minister of Finance to ^represent the strong view ofthe French Government against any further payment tothe United States.    They did not wish to intervene inany way in our affairs but they were convinced that theonly way of arriving at successful results at theWorld Conference was for all the debtors to America to treat the question of debts as settled on the basis ofLausanne, and to make no further payments to Americapending the negotiation of a final settlement.Monsieur Rueff said that Monsieur Bonnet&apos;message was motived by a report which they have just received from Washington.    In this report thePresident was alleged to have said that he had succeeded in getting the British Government to make a partial payment on the 15th June.    Sentiment in france would be hurt if we made such a payment.    It would draw a further line between the French and the british governments and would delay the possibility of a jointnegotiation with America.    Thus the discussions offer Debt settlement would drag on and the possibility of definite conclusions at the World Conference would beproportionately prejudiced.I told Monsieur Rueff that we had not offeredany part payment but that the question&apos;was still underconsideration.    I did not. however, follow the grounds on which the French Government objected to such a payment.There was, of course, a strong equitable case for linkingWar Debts and Reparations, but this connection had never been admitted by America and if we could avoid a default
by any partial payment there were strong arguments for it.     I promised, however, to report to you what he said*Monsieur Eueff added that Monsieur Bonnet feltso strongly on the question that he would he preparedif it would he useful, to come over and see you on saturday morning.(ii)
/./    a.- -to 195MOST SECRET. COPY WO.   //(IMPORTANT^     It is requested that all copies ofthis draft he returned to the Secretary,   to the Cabinet at the conclusion of thediscussion on the Note.)DRAFT NOTE TO UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.(With the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;samendments.)1. The imminence of the date when the next instalment of War Debt to the United States of America becomes due,coinciding with the opening of the World Monetary andEconomic Conference, /on the successful outcome of whichthe hopes of the general revival of prosperity are centred/&apos;&apos;impels His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom tocommunicate to the Government of the United States /the//certain/&apos; conclusions at which they have arrived on thesubject of War Debts.2. Their general views on these debts and on theirrelation to the present world difficulties were explained in the notes exchanged in November and December last.His Majesty&apos;s Government at that time decided to makepayment of the amount due on the 15th December, but theyindicated clearly that this payment &quot;was not to be regardedas a resumption of the annual payments contemplated by theexisting agreement&quot; and they announced their intention of treating this payment &quot;as a capital payment of which account should be taken in any final settlement.&quot;3. Finally, they pointed out that the procedure adopted-1-
&quot;must obviously be exceptional and abnormal&quot; andthey urged upon the United States Government &quot;theimportance of an early exchange of views with theobject of concluding the proposed discussion beforethe 15th June next in order to obviate the risk ofa general breakdown of existing inter-Governmentalagreements.&quot;4. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom adopted this procedure because they recog-nised the peculiar position in which the then UnitedStates Administration was placed, and the impossi-bility of their undertaking any effective discussionof the problem at that time.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment acted, however, on the understanding thata discussion would take place without delay, uponthe provisions of the existing agreement in all its aspects, so as to arrive at a comprehensive and final settlement, and in the belief that payment on the15th December would greatly increase the prospects ofa satisfactory approach to the v/hole question.5.      Negotiations were accordingly started even beforethe new administration was inaugurated, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have been most anxious to pursue them as rapidly as possible.,/On the occasion of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to washington/ the President and he made preliminaryexplorations as to the basis of a clearer understanding
IS?of the situation.      For reasons not withinthe control of either Government however, it&apos;has not yet been possible to arrive at a definite conclusion of these negotiations.6. A. speedy conclusion is, however, urgently needed. The treatment of War Debts must closelyaffect the solution of the problems with which theConference has to deal, because they cannot be separated from the influences which have brought the world to its present plight.       Indeed, thepossibility of the effective operation   of conference conclusions must largely depend firstupon the burden of inter-Governmental debts and thenupon the method of paying them.     For instance, HisMajesty&apos;s Government agree with the President thatone of the first and most essential of our aimsshould be to increase the general level of commodity prices.      It may be recalled that after the lausanne conference there was a marked tendency for prices torise, but that this tendency v/as reversed when theprospects of a final settlement of inter-Governmentalobligations receded, while the December payment was accompanied by a sharp fall in prices, which was felt in America at least as much as in Europe.      Theeffect of these payments upon prices is there for every close.
7. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government it isessential for the success of the Conference that the delegates should not he hampered and harassed by doubts about the possibility of a satisfactory settlement ofWar Debts.       The payment of a further instalment ofthe Debt at this juncture,, marking as it v/ould inevitablydoj, the fact that no progress whatever had been made towards such a settlements would in the judgment of HisMajesty&apos;s Government deal a fatal blow at the confidence of the delegates.8. In the circumstances and in view of their actionlast December His Majesty&apos;s Government had hoped thatthe United States Government would have been grantedauthority by Congress to accede to the request of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to postpone the payment of the June instalmentpending the discussion of War Debts as a whole.       Sincehowever9 this does not appear to have been found possibleHis Majesty&apos;s Government are obliged to decide upon their course of action.9. &apos;       Such a decision must in any case be of an extremelydifficult character and in considering it His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have felt their deep responsibility not only &quot;Nto their own people but to the whole v/orld which isawaiting the deliberations and. recommendations of theConference with the utmost anxiety.10.     I The conclusion at which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave arrived is that  the payment of the June instalmentv/ould gravely imperil the success of the Conference.-In their view this instalment should be considered and discussed as part of the general subject of war debts.      In orderto indicate their recognition that a suspension of the June payment    is not intended to prejudice any s ettlement which may ultimately be arrived at they are prepared now to make a token
payment of say -ten million ounces of silver, which wouldbe taken into account in the final settlement, and if theGovernment of the United States is prepared to accept this offer as a preliminary to debt negotiations His majesty&apos;s government would desire to enter upon such negotiations at the earliest possible moment and in such place as maybe designated by the United States Government.

For reasons already repeated so often weearmofc indefinitely continue payment of instalmentswithout receiving anything from our debtors andunyielding attitude of Congress gives no encouragement to hope that payment of June instalment would assist in final settlement or relieve us from any furtherhalf yearly instalments on existing- toasis*we have noted President *s suggestion as to a partor as we should prefer to say a token payments   It,might toe worth our while to make such a tokenpayment if thereby we could secure a normal indemnityagainst default.   President*s proposed procedure as reported in your paragraph five does not however go far enough, , It la confined to three followingdeclarations (a) he would acknowledge receipt (to)
put on record Hie Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;a statementof reasons (c) express his willingness to negotiateat Washington for a final settlement.Any payment now would involve us in considerable difficulties at home hut we might &quot;be prepared to makea token payment of 05 million to &quot;be taken into accounttogether with the payment last December in the final settlement if the President could give us an assurance that in acknowledging this payment he would state inaddition to (a) (b) and (c) above (d) that in hisopinion such payment was acceptable in the circumstances and (e) that in view of our having made it we ought notto he regarded as in default.     As regards (d) you should point out that this is in reality asking no more than the President would anyhow have to say ineffect in defending us against the charge of defaultas promised in your telegram under reference.In our note we should of course express our desire to enter as soon as possible on negotiations fora final settlement and would enquire when and wherenegotiations should take place.
