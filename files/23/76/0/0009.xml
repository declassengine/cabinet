PERSIA. 1. The Lord President of the Council called the attention of the Cabinet to a correction which(previous reference: had been issued to the draft Conclusions of the previous cabinet 36(33), Con-       Meeting.        In that draft a statement had beenelusion 3.)recorded to the effect that the draft telegram fromthe King to the Shah of Persia, attached to CP.-135(33), had actually been sent.    It had since transpired that this was incorrect.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the telegram could not be sent until after the ratification by Persia of the new Anglo-Persian OilAgreement, and this had not yet taken place.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to obtain His Ma,jesty&apos;consent to the despatch, of atelegram on the lines of the annex to CP.-135 (33) when the appropriate moment arrived.
THE PROPOSEDPOUR-POWER&quot;I agreement for MUTUALCO-OPERATION.I (previous reference:Cabinet 36(33), Con-clusion 4.)F.R.3^ (S32, The Cabinet again had before them the memo-randum by the Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  (C.P.-138 (.33)), circulated by direction ofthe Secretary of State, on the subject of the proposedFour-Power Agreement for Mutual Co-operation, consideration of which had been postponed at the meeting referred to in the margin.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs firstgave the Cabinet a resum^ of the Articles of theproposed Pact, and described theif significance.In the course of his observations on Article III he&apos; drew attention to the words &quot;the principle of equality of rights recognised by the Resolution of December 11,1932&quot;, and said that to meet the French this would be amended to read in some such terms as &quot;The principleof equality of rights such as is recognised (tel qu&apos;ila ete reconnu) by the Resolution of December 11, 1932&quot;He attached importance to Article IV, which would extend the Agreement for ten years ..Turning to Article II, the Secretary of Stateexplained.that the French insisted that it must applynot only to Articles 10 and 19 of the Covenant, butalso to Article 16, which deals with sanctions.   TheItalians and Germans, like ourselves, much preferred that no reference should be made to Article 16, and to confine the application of Article II to Articles 10and 19 of the Covenant.   The French, however, had committed themselves publicly by a statement made byM. Daladier to the Chamber, and had got themselvesinto a position where they could not sign the Four-Power Pact without the reference to Article 16.    Inthese circumstances both the Italians and Germans had reluctantly agreed to include the reference to Article16.   Consequently we were in the dilemma of either-2-
having to consent to the inclusion of a reference tothat Article or of getting blamed for wrecking the pact.   His own view, on balance, was that we shouldnot persist in standing out for the omission ofArticle 16.    His reasons were as follows:-First, in the House of Commons that very morninghe had stated as follows:-&quot;The obligations we have entered intowe shall strive to perform, but our friends on the Continent well under-stand, and it cannot be too clearly understood, that it is no part ofthe policy of G-reat Britain to assumefurther obligations of this Character.We take our existing responsibilitiestoo seriously to be willing light-heartedly to enlarge them&quot; .If we accepted the inclusion of a reference to article 16, the Secretary of State said that he wouldmake our position perfectly clear to M. Paladier and call his attention to the above statement.Second, we had already signed the Covenant ofthe League of Nations and were to that extent committed to the provisions of Article 16, which, however, were of a somewhat general character.    If we were how torefuse to sign the Pact on the ground that it included a reference to Article 16, the result would be toincrease the general unrest in Europe.Third, he had not the slightest apprehension ofany evil results from a meeting of the four Powers atwhich &quot;proposals relative to the methods and procedures&quot;to give effect to Article 16 were raised, since both germany and Italy, who shared our view, would berepresented.    In such an event his idea would be tostate that the British way of dealing with thesematters was to wait until the moment arrived.The Secretary of State added that he had spoken to Sir Austen Chamberlain on this subject.    Sir Austenhad at first been opposed to the Pact, but said that-3-
on the present lines he would approve and support it^and had agreed that it was impossible to refuse a pact put in this way.   The Secretary of State&apos;s view,therefore, was that It would be better to agree to theinclusion of a reference to Article 16 than to havethe responsibility of breaking down the prospect ofagreement.    In order to avoid a description ofArticle 16 of the Covenant comparable to the descrip-tion of Articles 10 and 19 contained in the present draft of Article II, he proposed to omit thesedescriptions altogether.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthe reference to Article   16 would be less objectionableif the following words in the first two lines wereomitted:- &quot;with a view to the ultimate application inEurope&quot; .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedthat these words ought to be altered.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that the Dominions had strong objectionsto sanctions.   He proposed,  therefore, to telegraph to them the passage from the speech by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs quoted above.The Lord President of the Council said he under-stood that the view of the Defence Services v/as thatwe should keep as far away from Article 16 of theCovenant as possible.The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to theAdmiralty, representing the First Lord (unavoidablyabsent) said that the Admiralty were nervous of our being manoeuvred into a position of having to give some decision of policy. They attached great importanceto adhering closely to the words  &quot;methods and proee-dures&quot;.
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, WarOffice, said that the Secretary of State (unavoidablyabsent) felt that there was no great disadvantage inthis, as we were already committed under the Covenant.The General Staff, however, had strong objections tosanctions, and pointed out that we were not in aposition to impose them.    They did not like the words&quot;methods and procedures&quot;, wrhich could be interpretedto mean the drawing up of plans. /The Under-Secretary of State and Vice-Presidentof the Air Council, speaking for the Secretary ofState for Air (unavoidably absent) had no remarks tomake.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thoughtit important to get rid of the final words,  &quot;calculated to give full effect to these Articles&quot;.The Chancellor of the exchequer suggested that instead of inserting the reference to Article 16between Articles 10 and 19, -the sentence should run&quot;Articles 10 and 19, together with Article 16&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to consider these points.   He saw the objection of the General Staff in the matter of plans.He did not think, however, that there was any riskof our being drawn into concerting plans with France,Germany and Italy.   There was at the moment no-one with whom the plans could be concerted.   He proposedto write a Despatch to the British Ambassador at Romewhich would eventually be published as a White Paper.It would include the principal points made at theMeeting of the Cabinet, and the passage from his speech in the Houise of Commons which is quoted above.The Lord President said he felt strongly thedanger of the whole plan breaking down, and the
importance of keeping Italy in the Western group ofnations.    The balance of argument, therefore, appeared in favour of doing what the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had suggested.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle the proposedFour-Power Agreement, including a reference in Article II thereof to article 16 of the Covenant, as wellas to Articles 10 and 19, subject tothe foilowing:-(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be given a reasonablediscretion to secure a re-draft ofArticle II in accordance with thediscussion of the Cabinet, and witha view to making the reference to article 16 as brief and non-committalas possible (e.g., in particular hewotild consider the following suggestions :-the elimination of the words &quot;with aview to the ultimate application inEurope&quot;:    the tentative suggestion to substitute for &quot;Articles 10, 16and 19&quot; the words  &quot;Articles 10 and 19,together with Article 16&quot;;    the omission of the description of Articles 10 and19, and of the final words &quot;calculated to give full effect to these Articles&quot;).(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs would leave the French PrimeMinister in no doubts as to our attitudetowards Article 16, and would draw his attention to the passage quoted abovefrom, his speech in Parliament the same day.(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should prepare a Despatch to theBritish Ambassador in Rome with a view tioits being published at the right time as a White Paper, quoting the passage inhis speech in Parliament, referred toabove, and elucidating the attitude ofHis Majesty&apos;sj Government in the UnitedKingdom towards the reference to article 16.
jPERSIA ANDTHE ARMSI TRAFFICJCONVENTION.([(PreviousiRef erence:jCabinet 36(33) ,fConclusion 6) .3.      The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Persia and the Arms TrafficConvention:    A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. 136(33) pointing out thata Sub-Committee of the Disarmament Conference had for some time been considering the preparation -ofan International Convention for the suppression ofillicit traffic in arms, and proposed, inter alia.a special maritime zone in which the   warships ofthe contracting parties should have the right to visit and control certain classes of vessels.This maritime zone included the Persian Gulf andthe Gulf of Oman, to which strong objection was raised by the Persian Government, who threatened towithdraw from the Conference unless an early solutioncould be found.     The Secretary of State asked for afollowingdecision as to which of the two/courses of action should be pursued:-(i) His Majesty&apos;s Government could ignore the Persian representations and continueto press for a Convention closely repro-ducing the provisions of that of 1925,and, in particular, including the persian gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the SpecialMaritime Zone;    or(ii) An attempt could be made to meet thePersian wishes by excluding the twoGulfs from the Maritime Zone providedfor in the Convention, and by dealingwith them in the two separate instrumentsproposed in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum.The Secretary of State trusted that his colleagues would agree to the adoption of course (ii).A Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(CP. 143(33)) together with a later Note attachedthereto   opposing the adoption of course (ii) above and pressing for a proposal to Persia on the lines-7-
of the compromise mentioned in paragraph 9 of cp. 136(33).A Eeport by the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East(CP. 140(33))  furnished in accordance with therequest of the Cabinet at the meeting mentioned inthe margin and submitting the following conclusions:-(l) That unless the right of verifying theflag of suspicious vessels is retainedit will be impossible in practice tocontrol the traffic in arms in thePersian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.If this right is to be lost in anycase, courses (i) and (ii) as statedwould be equally objectionable:(2) That there can be no question of extending reciprocally to Persianships the right to verify the flagof British Indian and Arab vessels:(3) That the most advantageous course ofaction to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be alternative (ii), as modified by paragraph 9 of CP, 136(33), i.e. ,to secure the right of verificationof flag in the case of the Persianflag only;    and that an effort shouldbe made to persuade the Persian Govern-ment to agree to this course:(4) That if our existing powers of control in the Persian Gulf are to be lost inany case, there would be certain advantages in obtaining a guaranteefrom the Persians that they would notclaim any rights of control over vesselsother than those flying the Persian flag.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) That the instructions to the british representative in any negotiationswith the Persian Government on thissubject should be in accordance with(l), (2) and (3) above, and that no reference should be made in thoseinstructions to the alternative course (4):(b) That if it was found impossible toobtain the acceptance of the proposals in (3) the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should again consult the cabinet who would consider whether it would bedesirable to fall back on (4),itshall Gardens, S.W.I.26th May, 1933.
