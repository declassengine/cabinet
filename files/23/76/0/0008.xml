PROPOSEDSPECIALDAY OPPRAYER.(previous reference:Cabinet 85(31), C on-clusion 1.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe Archbishop of Canterbury had received a largenumber of requests for a National Day of Prayerto be declared on June 11th in connection with the monetary and Economic Conference.    His Grace didnot intend to take any formal steps to declare aDay of Prayer, or to issue set forms of prayer, butproposed to issue some statement to the effect thathe hoped that on that day Christian citizens,bearing in mind the issue at stake, would pray forDivine guidance for the representatives of theBritish and other Governments participating.   the archbishop would like to be able to associate theGovernment in this suggestion.The Cabinet agreed with the PrimeMinister that, whatever might bethe personal views of individual members, it was better that anappeal of this kind should bemade on purely religious grounds and by the leaders of the Churches,without quoting in support a body,such as the Cabinet, representingpolitical opinion.
LAMP TAXATION 2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that and LANDVALUE TAX. he had received that morning a letter, with whichwere associated between 250 and 300 Members of(previous reference: Parliament, asking for a free vote on an amendmentCabinet 85(31), Con- to the Finance Bill standing in the name of Sir Georgeelusion 2 ,)Courthope, designed to secure the repeal of the taxation of land values clauses in the Finance act of 1931.   They claimed that the issues involved boreno relation to the raison d&apos;etre of the national government, and urged that the Government Whipsshould not be put on when the amendment was discussed.The Prime Minister pointed out that if this proposal was accepted he and the Labour Party section of theCabinet would be placed in an impossible position,particularly as the amendment followed so soon onthe decision on the taxation of Co-operatives.mhe Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that he had received a Deputation on thissubject.   An Opposition newspaper had suggested that,while he had given no assurances to the Deputation,he had given them a strong hint that they should putall the pressure they could on Members &quot;of Parliament.This, of course, was devoid of all foundation.   he expressed considerable indignation at the unreasonableand unjustified attitude of the Members of Parliament,to whom he had expressed himself in strong terms to the effect that it was not fair to put the PrimeMinister and some of his colleagues in this difficult position.   He had made three suggestions to theDeputation, which he had invited them to consideramong themselves without going back to their CommitteeHe understood that they had given these suggestionsonly a few minutes&apos;  consideration, and afterwardsthey had sent a letter demanding a free vote of the-2-
House.    To this demand he was strongly opposed.Nevertheless, he could not conceal that if theGovernment Whips were put on, it might result in bringing the Government&apos;s majority down to very smalldimensions.    This would be awkward at the opening ofthe Economic Conference.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs suggested that the Members of Parliament who hadassociated themselves with the letter to the PrimeMinister did not realise the danger of upsettingthe National Government,    In that event there was nodoubt that the action taken by the National government when they came into office would be nullified, withdisastrous consequences , hy their probable successors.This view met with unanimous support.After various suggestions had been considered,the Cabinet agreed  To accept the proposal that the lord president of the Council, accompaniedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer andany other colleague he might desire,should make an opportunity to see theMembers of Parliament in question and bring home to them the importance ofmaintaining the National Governmentin office and consequently of avoidingraising questions such as the onereferred to, which v/ere calculated toexercise a disintegrating effect.The Lord President should also takeadvantage of any suitable opportunityto make&quot;a statement of the same kindin the House of Commons .
PE^fTA- 3.   ^he Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-135(33))  on the subject of Anglo-Persian Relations;(Previous circulated for the information of his colleagues?e fre]?Gf: on the eve of his departure for Geneva.     ^heCabinet 1(33), Con- Memorandum reported a satisfactory settlement of elusion 6.)the dispute between the Persian Government and theF.R.. Anglo-Persian Oil Company, with a new concession3p(33)t. running until 1993, involving an extension of 30years beyond the term of the cancelled concession.Attached to the Memorandum was a draft telegramfrom the King to the Shah of Persia (in response toa suggestion by the British Minister in Tehran,supported by Sir John Cadman), to be sent afterthe ratification by Persia of the new Anglo-persian oil Agreement, expressing Kis Majesty&apos;s pleasure atthe successful conclusion of the negotiations.   TheMemorandum further stated that as the british minister was coming home on leave this would give anopportunity for a Committee representing the IndiaOffice, the Admiralty and the Foreign Office, to goover all the points with him, including the Persianrequest for the evacuation of Henjam, and to give him definite directions.The Secretary of State for India reportedthat as he had some doubts as to the expediency of the proposed telegram from the King to the shah of Persia, he had had a long talk with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs andSir John Cadman, with the result that he had not felt justified in offering any opposition to thecourse proposed.
Aete?-Ire-en t-nformed l&apos;Aal&quot;The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that^Sir John Cadman took an extremely favourable viewof the Agreement and of the prospects of clearing up the whole Persian situation.
Illi PROPOSED-POWERtfENTMUTUAL0-OPERATION.previous reference:Cabinet 30(33), Con-clusion 10.)37 [S3) Z,4. The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePermanent Under-Secretary of state for ForeignAffairs (CP.-138 (33)), circulated by directionof the Secretary of State, to which was attached atelegram from the Secretary of&apos;State (at Geneva)in regard to the negotiations for a Four-PowerAgreement for Mutual Co-operation, together with an english translation of the latest text drawn up bythe Italian Government after discussions with theBritish and French Ambassadors and also with theGerman Prime Minister.   The crucial Article of thistext was No.2, in which a reference was made to article 10 0f the Covenant (territorial integrity),and article 16 (sanctions), side by side with Article 19(reconsideration of Treaties).    Insistence by theFrench on the mention of Article 16, in which theGerman and Italian Governments had now reluctantlyacquiesced, placed upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the onus of deciding whether they would promote early agreement by accepting this unwelcome reference, whichmight lead to misrepresentation at home, or whetherthey would continue to resist the French demand withthe consequent risk of a breakdown of the Conference.The Cabinet were asked, for an immediate decision in order that instructions might be sent to Geneva.The Prime Minister pointed out that CP,-138 (33)had only been circulated late on the previous evening.There had been no time for any proper&apos; examination ofthe issues raised, either by Ministers or their departments .   Notwithstanding the importance of urgency, he could not take the responsibility of inviting the Cabinet to decide so important a questionwithout time for full examination by all concerned.He recalled that in passing through Paris on his wayhome from Geneva he had warned the French Government
that he could not agree to any proposal which, bylinking Article 16 of the Covenant on to Articles10 and 19, would commit us in any way to a &quot;Gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot; to impose sanctions.The Prime Minister&apos;s view that consideration should be postponed was unanimously accepted byopinionthe Cabinet, and the    /   was expressed that thequestion was one which would be difficult to decide in the absence of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thathe had learned from the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury that there was some doubt as to whetherthe Secretary of State would be able to return intime for the Debate on the Foreign Office Votearranged for Friday, May 26th.The Secretary to the Cabinet was instructed toreport the views of the Cabinet at once by telephoneto the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, atGeneva, and to ascertain whether it would be possiblefor him to return in time for the Debate on theForeign Office Vote on Friday, May 26th, after whichCP.-138 (33) would be discussed at a Special Meetingof the Cabinet.Later in the Meeting, after telephoning to geneva, the Secretary to the Cabinet reported thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was prepared to comply with the suggestion of the cabinet and that he quite appreciated the desire of hiscolleagues for further time.The Cabinet agreed  That the questions raised in C.P.-138(33) should be considered at a special meeting of the Cabinet to be held onFriday, May 26th, at 4 p.m., in thePrime Minister&apos;s Room at the Houseof Commons.
THE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE.Pr e vi previous reference:Cabinet 35(33), Con-clusion 4.)F.R.5. The Secretary to the Cabinet, after telephon-ing to Geneva, as mentioned in the previousConclusion,  informed the Cabinet that he wasrequested by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to say that the situation at Geneva todaywas rather troublesome owing to a speech made atthe close of the previous day&apos;s discussion byM. Paul-Boncour raising the question of Frenchsectirity.   M. Paul-Boncour&apos;s. attitude had arousedsome indignation, especially in the United states delegation.   Mr Norman Davis wished to find some means to call the French to order, and doubted ifmuch could be done unless M, Daladier could bebrought to Geneva.   This, in Mr Norman Davis&apos;opinion, could only be accomplished if Heads of states&quot; were to attend the Disarmament Conference.Sir John Simon realised the importance to the monetary and Economic Conference of the PrimeMinister taking the brief rest that had beenarranged in the interests of his health, and wasusing his influence to steady the situation.
PERSIA AMDTHE ARMSTRAFFICONVENTION.previous reference:Cabinet 43(29), Con-clusion 3.)F.R.37^35)3 .6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-136(33)) raising an urgent question in connection withthe proposed arrangements for the control of armstraffic in the Persian G-ulf.Several Ministers pointed out that the memorandum in question had only reached them late on the previous evening and there had been no proper time for them to study it themselves, much less to consult their departments.   A suggestion was made that the question should first be considered by the Middle East Committee.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question raised in CP.-136 (33)should be referred at once for consider-ation by the Middle East Committee:(b) that the Conclusions of the Middle EastCommittee should be submitted to anearly Meeting of the Cabinet.
7. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thattheir Committee had been working continuously on theDraft Agenda Paper, which had now been examined indetail.   Agreements had been reached as to the policy to be adopted under each heading.   nhe Conclusionswould take the form of Resolutions or Declarations,which were now being drafted.   After the Committeehad had a further meeting to approve them they wouldbe submitted for the Cabinet&apos;s examination and decision.   The Cabinet Committee, however, was sorepresentative in character that the Prime Ministeranticipated that his colleagues would be able toaccept their recommendations.The Cabinet took note of the present ime Minis t er&apos;s s ta t ement.

The possible effect of such action at this particular moment,with the near approach of the Monetary and EconomicConference, impelled the President to revive thequestion, and after reviewing the arguments for and against withdrawal, which were fairly evenly balanced,his own inclination was to refrain from withdrawing from the Convention on June 30th next.After discussion the Cabinet agreed  That formal notice should be given of our intention to denounce theConvention, but it should be explained that this is in orderthat we may be free to enter into any agreements that may emerge fromthe Monetary and Economic Conference.v-14-

This further increase was proposedin order to give the same degree of protection against Japanese competition as that provided by themethod of calculation adopted by the Tariff Board inAugust last, when the Exchange stood at a higher figure.   The Secretary of State was convinced that,on political and commercial grounds, a refusal toallow the Government of India to increase these duties would cause serious and possibly irreparabledamage,After hearing a statement from the Secretary ofState for India, the Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposal that theGovernment of India should beallowed to increase the duties asset forth above, as a continuation of their present policy.
