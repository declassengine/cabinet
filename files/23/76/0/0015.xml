T . 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidiatiQns he had discussed the matter he was about to lay before*th&quot; the Cabinet with the Lord President of the Council, who)Previous        had an engagement which prevented him from attending the reference:Cabinet 36     Cabinet.   The Lord President had been disposed to accept(33), Con-Illusion 12.) the proposals he was about to lay before his colleagues.The Secretary of State said he had had two interviews with Mo Litvinoff during the present week.   At firstM, Litvinoff had made some impossible proposals, withwhich he would not trouble the Cabinet in detail.   He had formed the conclusion that M. Litvinoff, whose position was possibly not very secure, would not at present agreeto the release of the two prisoners first and the with-drawal of the embargo after they reached home, but mightnevertheless he in a position to agree to the Russianstaking steps to release the British prisoners, subjectto simultaneous action by ourselves.   The question whichthe Cabinet had to decide was whether the time-tableproposed was acceptable.   The proposal was that M.Litviro ffshould call at the Foreign Office on Friday morning toinform the Secretary of State that M. Kalinin, as headof the Soviet Executive, had had laid before him all thecircumstances of the Thornton-MacdonaJd cases, including their petitions and the contemplated cancellation of the embargo on either side, and that M. Kalinin was willingto give his consent to a free pardon for Thornton andMacdonald so that they would be   free to leave Russiaimmediately.   M. Litvinoff had assured him that for all practical purposes M. Kalinin&apos;s decision would be effective.   M&apos;. Litvinoff would add that the formaldecision of the Presidium of the Executive Committeeof the Soviets would be taken on the following day(Saturday) and the necessary papers signed, and at thesame time the Commissar for Trade would cancel the
counter-embargo/on British exports.     All this would be on the assumptionthat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was thenable to inform M. Lltvinoff that a meeting of the privy council would take place on Saturday, when the Proclamationrevoking our embargo of April 19th would be passed.     Itwas clearly agreed that there should be no publication orannouncement or reference in the Press, either in Russiaor here, of any of the decisions taken on Saturday, orof the intention to take them, until the following(Sunday) morning, when the newspapers in both countries would publish the documents:    that is to say, in thiscountry the Sunday newspapers would contain an announce-ment that the Secretary of State had seen M. Litvinoffand that the prisoners would be released,etc.     In thesame papers would appear the Order in Council cancellingthe Proclamation issued under the Russian Goods (import prohibition) Act, 1933,     The Secretary of State mentioned that M. Litvinoff had, up to now, behaved very well so faras publicity was concerned.     After their interviewsa communique had been drawn up, and nothing else hadbeen published on either side.     To sum up, everythingwould be concluded on Saturday and announced on Sunday.In his interviews with M. Litvinoff he   had, by consentof the President of the Board of Trade, been accompaniedby the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade.The idea was, after the Vickers&apos; affair was settled, toallow the Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations to be taken up at the point where they had been dropped.     M. Litvinoffhad shown some suspicion lest we should use the RussianGoods (Import Prohibition) Act in connection with tiietrade negotiations.      The Secretary of State, however, hadreminded him of the President of the Board of Trade&apos;sstatement in Parliament to the effect that it would only beused in connection with the release of the prisoners.
M. Litvinoff had asked for a note repeating thestatement that the Act was only intended in connectionwith the release of prisoners.   The Secretary ofState had made it clear that we desired to keep thetrade negotiations entirely separate from the contro-versy which was now to be closed, and that any action taken in connection with our futtire trade arrangements would be entirely separate from the present Act or anyProclamation thereunder.   He would, if desired, beprepared to hand M. Litvinoff a note confirmingMr RuncimanTs statement, although, of course, what mr Runciman had then said was stated on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government as a whole and remained an effective undertaking.   The question, therefore, was whether the Cabinet had sufficient confidence inM. Litvinoff to carry out this plan.   It was true thatit had been announced that we should not cancel the proclamation until the prisoners had reached. Britishsoil.   His intention, however, if this arrangement wasadopted by the Cabinet, was to telegraph to Mr Strangto meet the prisoners and look after them until theyleft Russia.In the course of the discussion it was suggestedthat in the House of Commons criticism would be on two points(1) That it had been understood previouslythat the prohibitions would not beremoved until the prisoners were inthis country:     and(3) To know whether we were completely freein the event of a failure of the trade negotiations.On the second point the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs recalled that during the debates on the Russian Goods  (import Prohibition) Bill hehad pointed out that the Treaty negotiations wouldbe kept entirely separate from the controversy over
the prisoners.   He did not know,  of course, whethera Trade Agreement could be arrived at, or what our attitude would be in the event of failure.    In replyto a question he said that if the Soviet Governmentfailed to implement the agreement with M, Litvinoffa fresh Proclamation could be issued at once underthe existing Act.Some discussion took place as to the effects on trade of the Proclamation.The President of the Board of Trade said that theBoard of Trade had received a great many representa-tions from traders which showed that the cumulative effect of the embargo on trade was considerable.F/very week the difficulties increased.   Traders had got into considerable trouble as their contractshad been broken, liabilities wiped owt, and consider-had arisen,able complications^  particularly in the case of the timber trade, which passed through many hands.    A gooddeal of business had been lost.   Recently, for example,the cooperage trade had received considerable orders on American account and were confronted with great difficulties owing to the fact that ready-made stavescould be obtained only from Russia.   He had aconsiderable list of difficulties of this kind, andhe had to admit that the British loss ran into fairlylarge figures.   He paid a tribute to the attitude oftraders towards the policy, considering their difficulties.   The relief would be very considerableif agreement were reached.   He added thatduring the continuance of the embargo the RussianGovernment had paid all their obligations to thiscountry.The Cabinet expressed satisfaction at the successof the negotiations, and agreed  
(a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs:(b) That, if agreement were reached,the King should be asked to holda Council on Saturday morning to approve a Proclamation cancellingthe previous Proclamation:(c) That the Gazette should be issuedas late as possible on Saturday:(d) That the Proclamation should comeinto operation from the date atwhich it was made, - Saturday,July 1st:(e) That the decision of the cabinet should on no account be made publicuntil it was announced in Sundaymorning&apos;s newspapers.
UEXT MEETING S.   The Cabinet agreed  OP CABINET *That the date of their next meeting should be left to the Prime Ministerto determine.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.Wtl,June 29, 1933.
