THE CO-operative societies.ProposedTaxationof *(previous reference:Cabinet 31(33V, Con-clusion 5.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer describedfor the benefit of the Prime Minister what had happened during his absence in Washington.    Ina spirit of conciliation he had sought, in consult-ation with the Co-operative Societies, some agreedbasis of taxation as an alternative to the proposals in the Raeburn Report, and had more especially madeefforts to avoid trenching on the principle ofmutuality, to which the Societies attached so much importance.   As he had already explained to theCabinet during the Prime Minister&apos;s absence (seeearlier Cabinet Minutes), his alternative proposal was only workable with the co-operation of the societies:    otherwise it would throw the whole ofthe payment on the Retailers;    it would exempt frompayment the Wholesale Societies;   means could befound for evading the taxation;    and some of the taxation would be paid twice over, namely, by the societies and the recipients.   Owing to the failure to reach agreement, the Cabinet must now decide what was to be done.   There were three possible courses:-(1) To do nothing;(S) To adopt the Raeburn Report; and(3) To devise some new tax to be imposed on the Co-operative societies as a substitute for income Tax, which, it could berepresented, had been devised for the taxation of individuals and had not been found easy toapply to the peculiar positionof the Co-operative Societies.So far as the first course was concerned, theChancellor of the Exchequer said he was informedthat there was a strong feeling that the Governmentwould suffer in prestige if nothing was done.
&quot;The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Prime Minister that since his absencnothing had been mooted in the Cabinet that was notprompted by a desire to reach a satisfactory basis.He thought that in the House of Commons the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s proposal would arouse a greateropposition than the Whips thought.      The sum that theChancellor of the Exchequer was likely to obtain wasnot likely to be much.      Mr^Churchill had estimatedit at  100,000 a year, and Lord Sncwfiten at  300,000.The Committee said  1,200,000*      He warned hiscolleagues that this decision would probably costhim his seat.      That applied to others, includingthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, dominions office.     Nevertheless the affair had., in his view,reached a stage when the Chancellor of the exchequer could not do nothing.      Consequently he himself would not stand in the way of his proposals, though he feared the Government would get more of a shockthan they expected.     The issue, however, wassecondary compared with the importance of maintaining the National Government in office in the present state of the world.The Prime Minister said that his seat also wouldbe imperilled by this decision.      He hoped, however,that something else might happen before an election to counteract the effect of the taxation ofCo-operatives,      Since, however, there appeared tobe no alternative, he, for his part, would acceptthe Raeburn Report.&quot;
4%^He did not recommend the third course.    Its mainadvantage was that it avoided any infringement ofthe principle   of mutuality.   The objection was thatit would not conciliate the Co-operatives, who wouldfear that the tax might be increased arbitrarily by subsequent Governments.The third course met with no support at all inthe Cabinet, as it would be criticised as singlingout the Co-operative Societies and exposing them toa new system of taxation the amount of which would be liable to be increased.&quot;The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Prime Minister that since his absencenothing had been mooted in the Cabinet that was notprompted by a desire to reach a satisfactory basis.He thought that in the House of Commons the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s proposal would arouse a greateropposition than the Whips thought.

He did not recommend the third course.    Its mainadvantage was that it avoided any infringement ofthe principle   of mutuality.   The objection was thatit would not conciliate the Co-operatives, who wouldfear that the tax might be increased arbitrarily by subsequent Governments.The third course met with no support at all inthe Cabinet, as it would be criticised as singlingout the Co-operative Societies and exposing them toa new system of taxation the amount of which would be liable to be increased.There was also general agreement that it was/impossible to do nothing.   Even members of the/cabinet who had felt misgivings about the Raeburn Report were agreed that a policy of inaction could/not be followedwithout discrediting the Chancellor/of the Exchequerand the Government.    Some of the-se members informedtheir colleagxies that their^eats would be endangeredat the next General Elecjyfon by the adoption of theRaeburn Report.   Nevertheless, in all the circumstancethey felt that the/ issue was a minor one compared withthe importance/of maintaining in office the national government/in the present world-wide difficulties .In the circumstances they expressed their willingness2dcept an announcement of taxation based on theurn Report.The Lord President of the Council said that thewhole Cabinet would respect and admire the attitudethese members had taken up.   Their colleagues recognisedtheir difficulties, and especially those of the PrimeMinister.   A good deal of time would elapse before thenext General Election, and he hoped that in the meanwhile other events would compensate the disadvant-ages in the constituencies of the present decision.
In any event he and his friends could promise theirwarm support to the Prime Minister up to the end ofthe present Parliament.The Prime Minister, in thanking the lord president, realised that the Chancellor of theExchequer had made every possible effort to secure a compromise.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should base his taxation of Co-opera-tive Societies on the Raeburn Report:(b) That as the announcement was not likelyto.be made., for Parliamentary reasons.before May 22nd. the utmost reticenceshould be observed in the interim asto,, the Cabinet&apos; s dec is ion.
THE BRITISHfAR DEBT TOf% UNITEDSTATES.The primeministers visit to washington.(previous reference:Cabinet 23(33), Con-elusion 3.)PROPOSEDTARIFF TRUCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(33), Con-clusion 2.)THE WORLDMONETARY ANDECONOMICCONFERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(33), Con-elusion 3.)2. The Prime Minister made a statement as tohis recent visit to Washington.    In connection withthis statement a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs on the Monetary and EconomicConference and on the question of a Tariff Trucehad been circulated (C.P.-118 (33))..^he Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that hehad already made a very full verbal report on his visit to Washington to the Cabinet Committee on theBritish War Debt to the United States, and he wouldmake a shorter report to the Cabinet.    So far asDebts were concerned, his conversations had been satisfactory.   The President of the United States wasin an awkward position, but he sincerely desired full agreement with the British Government.   No record hadbeen kept of his conversations with Mr Roosevelt.They had talked as friends who wanted to put all theircards on the table, and each had stated all his diffi-culties.   He himself had not hesitated to say thatrepudiation was much nearer than he liked:    theGovernment would have to consider it without feelingbound, to reject, it.   Mr Roosevelt had said that hewas in no doubt as to the importance of the LausanneSettlement.   He had described it as the greatest thingdone since the Peace, and it was clear that he was anxious to play up to it.   The President had absolutelyno power to deal with Debts.   That might be changedMr. Rooseveltnext week.   He believed that /   had intended to getpowers last Wednesday, but he had put so many Billsbefore Congress that he was behind his programme.The President, however, was proposing, and had giventhe Prime Minister a very firm pledge, to ask forpowers to deal with the Debt situation before
Disarmament.The world conference.Tariff Truce.Congress rose..   He might have more to tell theCabinet on this subject after the President hadreceived his powers, but at the moment he was rathertied.On the subject of Disarmament he and thePresident had been in general agreement.   Mr Rooseveltwas willing to accept no amendments to the British draft Convention that would tend to weaken it.He had instructed Mr Norman Davis to this effect,and. also that he was to oppose excessive pretensionson the part of Germany .As regards the World Conference, in agreementwith M. Herriot they had decided to ask that it shouldbe opened on June 12th.In the Papers he had taken to Washington wasthe idea of a Tariff Truce.   He had not much likedit in its application.    In Washington he had found,however, that the Americans also had it on theiragenda.   He had found that the Marketing Act con-tained provisions which required quotas to put themin operation.   That had made an awkward situation for him, and Mr&apos;Roosevelt had not much &apos; liked it.After full discussion, first between the Experts andthen by the President and himself in the presence ofthe Experts, agreement had been reached that the truce should not be used to interrupt continuingnegotiations or a policy that had. begun to be developed but was unfinished.    Its object was to stop new initiative.The subject of the Tariff Truce had beencomplicated somewhat by Mr Norman Davis&apos;s action atthe meeting of the Organising Committee of the [jMonetary and Economic Conference held on the 29thApril, when he announced that the United States-5-
Delegation intended to ask the participating Govern-ments to join in a detailed agreement on the subject.by reference toSir John Simon having explained /   CP.-118 (33) thatMr Norman Davis had not acted on his own initiative,the Prime Minister said he had understood that theactual forrrrula was to have been worked out by the experts of the United Kingdom, the United States andFrance after he left Washington, and he had not yetseen the formula they produced.   The idea in the mirdof Mr Roosevelt and himself had been to agree on a plan for a Tariff Truce to be put before the Confer-ence, embracing the following points:-(l) Power to continue negotiationsalready begun;(S) Power to issue Orders which wrere underconsideration as the result of legisla-tion already passed;(3) In the matter of Quotas a discrimina-tion to be made between industrial and agricultural quotas .Only that morning Mr Norman Davis had been to see him to say that the whole Conference would be injeopardy if the United Kingdom opposed the TariffTruce.   He had told Mr Davis to cable to America thatwe were stillawaiting the draft that was to be prepared.He had learned the same morning from Mr Davis that france (who, of course, had completed, a whole systemof tariffs,  quotas, and so forth) was in favour ofmaking the truce as comprehensive as possible!    Hesuggested that *Tis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at washington should be asked to send the draft that was to beprepared in regard to the truce, in order that itmight be examined.The United States Government wanted to reducetariffs considerably.   Mr Hull, the new Secretary ofState, was a strong opponent of tariffs, and Mr Roosevelt
supported him.   At the same time they consideredfree trade quite out of the question.   In additionto tariffs, the subjects to be considered at theWorld Conference included Quotas and stabilisation of Currencies.   Mr Roosevelt was not very keen onthe maintenance of the Gold Standard, which apparentlyhad no political value in America.   He was more interested in a Silver Standard, which had a politicalvalue.   At the same time the President was most anxiousto avoid instability between the Pound, the Dollarand the Franc.   The President thought that the Dollarhad been over-valued before America came off Gold,and wanted to reduce its value.   He had talked of &quot;notmore than 50 per cent.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said his latest estimate was not more than 20 per cent.The Prime Minister added that these matters didnot appear to have been worked out in any detail bythe American Treasury.   He himself had said that hewas anxious to avoid, instability of currencies, butthe details were a matter for experts .   The Americansappeared to have no policy except that they realised that they were in for inflation in order to raisecommodity prices.   He had advised Mr Roosevelt to study these matters.   At the moment the Administrationwere almost completely cut off from banking advice,aand/well-known banker   he had seen in New York wasvery depressed.   President Roosevelt controlled Congress 1in an extraordinary degree, notwithstanding that muchof the patronage at his disposal had been dealt with.He had so strong, a support from public opii ion inAmerica that even the Senate hesitated to oppose him.- nSummarising, the Prime Minister said that President!Roosevelt had impressed him by his personality.   He was g
anxious for a complete understanding with us oneverything.   He could see his way to an arrangementas regards the June and, if necessary, the Decemberinstalments of Debt.    On Tariffs the American attitudeat the World Conference might prove satisfactory.On Quotas they might go further than us and adoptthe attitude of smaller countries, such as denmark and Belgium;    but he had been assured that they wouldnot carry opposition to the point of embarrassing us.On international affairs there was agreement on all points, inclxtding even a Consultative Pact to reassure the French as to their security.   As regards Germanythey would support the same kind of policy as ourselves .Mr Roosevelt&apos;a great preoccupation was Japan.    On that subject he himself had not felt prepared to tell him.the recent decisions .    Sir Robert Vansittarthad had conversations with Mr Hull and Mr Stimson,who, though out of office, was still consulted.The popular effect of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit hadbeen even greater than that of his previous visit toMr Hoover, of which he gave evidence to the Cabinet.At the moment he did not wish to say more on thesubject of Debts, and he asked his colleagues to exercise the utmost reticence as to, what he had said.The Prime Minister sai^i that he proposed to appoirtta Cabinet- Committee to work out, for consideration bythe Cabinet, the policy of the Government at the monetary and Economic Conference.i
The forthcoming debate inparliament onThe primeminister&apos; visit .3. The Cabinet discussed at considerable lengththe attitude to be adopted during the forthcoming debate on Tuesday. May 9th, on the Prime Ministersrecent visit to Washington.   They were informed thatthe Opposition would press not only for furtherinformation from the Prime Minister but also as tothe attitude to be adopted by the Government at theWorld Conference,,    In addition, they were especiallylikely to ask for information as to the attitude ofthe Government towards the Tariff Truce.There was general agreement that the PrimeMinister could not be expected to add substantially to the statement he had made on the previous day:also that it would be out of the question for theGovernment to tie their hands by announcing beforehandthe policy they intended to pursue at the world conference.    In this respect they would have to takethe same line as in the case of the Conferences ofLausanne and Ottawa.   Useful statements might be madeon the basis of the annotated Agenda for the monetary and Economic Conference prepared by the League ofNations Expert Committee.   Beyond that it would notbe expedient to go.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should&apos;instruct the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury to place himself in touch with the leader of the Opposition and suggest thatthe Debate on Tuesday, May 9th,should not extend beyond 7-30, andthat a fresh subject should be putdown for discussion after that hour.(NOTE: The Prime Minister sent for the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury and before the endof the Meeting instructed him to take actionaccordingly.)
4, The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Reduction and Limitationof Armaments :-A Note by the Secretary (CP.-120(33)) enumerating the principalsubjects on which decisions arelikely to be required by the UnitedKingdom Delegation at Geneva:The Draft Diisarmament Conventionsubmitted to the DisarmamentConference at Geneva on March 16,1933, by the Prime Minister(CP.-74 (33)), which had been circulated to the Cabinet forinformation on March 20, 19 33,by direction of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.&apos;The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, ForeignOffice, who had arrived during the Meeting from geneva by air, said he had not a very favourablereport to make.   Progress with the discussion of theBritish Draft Convention had been very slow.   various factors in the present state of Europe, such as the^nervousness of the countries of the Little Entente,increased the difficulties.   Recently the conference had come up against the first of the real difficultiesDiscussion of Chapter- I had been adjourned, for thereason that the Americans were not ready to considerit.   During the last few days the General commission had been discussing the first part of chapter-pt-er II,dealing with Effectives.   No decision had beenreached, except perhaps a single one on theA subjectof Police forces .   The main difficulty was thatGermany had rejected the proposals for the standard-isation of Continental Armies, to which the Frenchattached the utmost importance.An important point arose as to procedure.   TheGermans desired to continue a First Reading of theremainder of Gliaptor II, dealing with- Material.tM-t*  ^**^tj&amp;&amp; y       lift -&amp;sT-  **y ?4r-The French, however, sou-ld-not discuss Materialuntil they knew what was to be the basis of the
BelligerentRights at Sea(Previous-Reference:* Cabinet 60&quot;(30), Con-clusion 10.)various Armies.   An alternative procedure was to go back to a Second Reading of the Articles on EffectivesDecisions, however, were only possible by vote, andthat meant something like the isolation of Germany,which might even result in Germany leaving theConference,   Germany&apos;s desire to discuss Material wasthat on this subject Prance might be thrown on the defensive   and, as mentioned during the Meeting,the United Kingdom also.   He did not conceal that, a break oxrer the first part of Chspt-ea? I might mean the break-up of the Conference.    If that happenedthe Conference would have broken down owing to theattitude of Germany and not of Prance.Another plan would be to go back to Sh^pt-er I,but he understood that the United States Delegate wasnot prepared for this .   The advantage of that plan,if it could be carried out, was that it would give time for putting pressure on Berlin, if this wasconsidered desirable.The Prime Minister thought that the American delegation ought to be ready to discuss Shaptrer I.Mr Roosevelt&apos;s attitude had been that he could notsubscribe to the Articles in Chapter I withoutsubmitting the Convention to the Senate, who might make difficulties .   He understood his plan was to pxta foot-note making clear that when the United Statesthought right they would take part in consultations.Mr Roosevelt had been particularly anxious to beunfettered either as to joining in any consultationor in the action to be taken as the result thereof.The President had, however, gone a good deal further and had said that the United States would not protectAmerican subjects in trading with a country that hadbeen declared an aggressor.   He had made it clear that-11-
it was his intention to make an announcement of that kind before the Conference came to an end.The Parliamentary Under-Seeretary, ForeignOffice, said that, if Mr Norman Davis would agree,the best plan would be to go back and discussOha^&amp;er i,   He understood, however, that the americans had not yet prepared the actual draft oftheir statement and would not assent to this course.In the circumstances, he would be glad of a decision.The Cabinet also discussed the question of whether diplomatic pressure should be exerted at berlin with a view to inducing the German Governmentto modify their attitude on Effectives, whichthreatened to wreck the Conference.    If such repre-sentations were likely to have any effect they weredeemed desirable, but the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs was doubtful on the point.    It wassuggested that more likely the result would be to stimulate the German Government to seek a break on some subject where France would be on the defensive.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That if the Disarmament Conference wasn&apos;t  , unable to return to the discussion off^f Chapter I of the Draft Convention, theBritish Representative at the Bureaushould be authorised to press for a procedure under which the conference should take     Second Reading of the portion of Shaffer II, dealing withEffectives, before proceeding to a first Reading of the remainder of the(Jhapt-e^;       ,;(b) That the question of whether repre-sentations should be made at Berlin&quot; with a view to a modification of theGerman attitude should be left tothe decision of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.-IS-
5. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, ForeignOffice, said that the United Kingdom had now beenasked to give their figures for Effectives.   Thefigures proposed involved an increase of 50,000&quot; menon the figures previously given, whereas the figureswe had inserted for Continental Armies were for themost part less than, and in some cases equal to, theexisting figures.   This was calculated to place him in an embarrassing position when the figures were discussed.The Secretary of State for War reminded theCabinet that when the policy of the Draft Conventionhad been under consideration he had given warning thatthis very difficulty was bound to arise, as well as another difficulty owing to the impossibility of ouragreeing to a truce as affecting Tanks .   He was underthe impression that at that time the Cabinet and thePrime Minister himself thought it would be wiser notto produce a Draft Convention.   Nevertheless, circum-stances had necessitated the production of a convention and against this he raised no objection.   For reasons which had been fully developed in Papers preparedfor the Ministerial Committee, it was impossible forthe War Office to reduce their figures.   As a matterof fact, however, the increase was not so great as it seemed.   They were far below the figures in theHoover Plan.   Moreover, in previous returns we had given figures for actual strengths rather thanauthorised strengths of our military forces9 thedifference being about 30,000.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, ForeignOffice   said it was not improbable that the EffectivesCommission at Geneva would allow some 3^,000 of our troops abroad to count as Police forces .
The Prime Minister pointed out that the 20,000difference between actual strength and establishmentsmentioned by the Secretary of State for War, added tothe 2^,000 mentioned by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, would account for nearly the whole of the50,000 excess.    He suggested, therefore, that afoot-note should be added to the figures as communi-cated to the Disarmament Conference explaining how the increase was accounted for.The Cabinet approved thisproposal.
The Cabinet agreed  That consideration of the   various points on Disarmament shotild bereferred to a Committee of Ministerscomposed of such members of the ministerial Committee on Disarmamentas were available, supplemented byany members of the Cabinet who found it possible to attend at 10 downing street the same afternoon at 2-30 p.m.
INDIA.OpoliticalSituationin.Release ofMr Gandhi.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(33), Con-clusion 2.)7. The Secretary of State for India, as amatter of urgency, informed the Cabinet thatMr Gandhi had decided to start a hunger-strike onMonday next, May 8th.   Mr Gandhi had stated thatthe strike was not against His Majesty&apos;s government but the Caste Hindus,   The Secretary of State wasin agreement with the Viceroy and the Governor of bombay that Mr Gandhi was prepared to starve himself to death;    that he could not be allowed to die onthe hands of the Government;    that if he wasreleased from prison be would not do much harm;    thatif he was to be released it would not do to wait until he was seriously ill;    and that in thesecircumstances the best plan would be to releasehim immediately after he had started hunger-strikingon Monday.The Cabinet approved this course.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W,1,May 5,  1933.
