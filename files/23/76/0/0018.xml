CABINET 46 (55), Conclusion 1.1.      THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that thequestion he wished to bring before the Cabinet aroseout of a Loan issued in New York in 1917, during theWar, for a total amount of slightly over 156,000,000Dollars (equivalent to  28,000,000 at par)  in the formof Gold Dollar Bonds, repayable in 1937, carryinginterest at the rate of 5^ per cent, payable in GoldDollars.     The next coupon of these Bonds was payable on August 1st.     Since the payment of the last couponthe United States Government had passed legislationrepudiating their obligation to pay in gold the Bondsthat they dealt with.     The question, therefore, on whichthe Cabinet was consulted, was as to whether we were totake advantage of American legislation and pay thecoupon in paper Dollars, arguing in support of suchaction that the Loan had been raised in New York underAmerican law and was therefore payable now underAmerican law:    or, alternatively, were we to adopt amore austere practice and say that, whatever the UnitedStates Government might have decided as to its internalLoans, we were not going to take advantage of theirlegislation so far as our Loan was concerned?    ThisLoan was held mainly in America, but some also was heldon the Continent and in this country.     The Loan was actually a commercial issue, though concluded by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that his advisers had at first taken the view that we were notbound to pay more than what was prescribed by theAmerican law.     In fact, on legal grounds there was nodoubt on this point.     They had pointed out that, in so-1(a)-
far as some of the Bonds were held outside of America,this was because the holders of the Bonds had thoughtthat Dollar Bonds were better than Sterling Bonds, andtherefore they ought to accept the consequences oftheir choice.      His advisers had also said that we werenot bound in equity to pay in gold values.As against this view it was argued that we werein the main a creditor country and we ought not to do anything to throw doubt on the spirit or letter of a contract.     In this connection Mr. Chamberlain read an extract from an article in the &quot;Financial News&quot; ofJuly 15th.      A somewhat similar question had arisen inthe case of Belgian, Swiss and French Loans, which thosecountries had decided to meet in gold.     It was truethat these countries differed from us in being stillon the Gold Standard, but that precedent could not beleft out of account.At first he himself had contemplated a plan togive holders of the Loan an option of payment in the equivalent of gold in consideration of repatriating theLoan by accepting payment in sterling instead of dollars.The original form of this proposal would have involvedlegislation, and it would have been necessary to hand ina Financial Resolution this evening.     That was why he had asked for a Meeting of the Cabinet to-day.      Since then,however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been consider-ing another plan, which would avoid legislation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s recommendation tothe Cabinet was to honour the spirit and the letter ofour obligations.     It involved a burden on the taxpayer,not, it was true, greater than he had expected, but greaterthan if he took advantage of the alteration in the American-S4b)-

That was why he had asked for a Meeting of the Cabinet to-day.     Since then,however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been consider-ing another plan, which would avoid legislation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s recommendation tothe Cabinet was to honour the spirit and the letter ofour obligations.     It involved a burden on the taxpayer,not, it was true, greater than he had expected, but greaterthan if he took advantage of the alteration in the American4-(d)-
law.     The fact was that we could not pay the coupon ingold coin of the United States owing to recent Americanlegislation.     He suggested, therefore, that we should give a new option to the holders of the Loan, under whichthey should accept for the original Bonds new SterlingBonds, hearing a low rate of interest, repayable in 1937:that is to say, for every  100 Sterling we should substitutesome higher figure, the exact amount of which he could notyet estimate.      In fact, one difficulty was that the priceof G-old in 1937 could not be estimated;   but his aim wouldbe to offer a new Bond which as nearly as possible wouldfulfil the expectations of the original Loan.     Owing tothis uncertain factor he could not give the Cabinet anyreliable estimate of the amount that his proposal would cost, though, very tentatively, he suggested  10,000,000.Turning to the question of procedure, the Chancellorof the Exchequer said that the Government possessed extremelywide powers of conversion.     He was not particularly anxiousto arouse enquiry in the House of Commons as to the extentof these powers, which it was useful to have.     What he hadin mind was that if the Cabinet approved his proposal, a white Paper should be issued and he should announce theGovernment^ intention to ask the House of Commons to passa Declaratory Resolution on the White Paper.     That would avoid a Financial Resolution.     He hoped a DeclaratoryResolution might be obtained by Friday of the present week.In submitting his proposal the Chancellor of the Exchequeremphasised how difficult the choice was between taking advantage of a change in the American domestic law to reduce our payments, or, alternatively, paying a larger sum in orderto maintain a standard of integrity not only in this countryhut throughout the world, - the value of which could hardly-^fc) -
3tf)&quot;be estimated in financial terms.      If any of hiscolleagues would like to help him in deciding theprice that should be offered in the conversion hewould be only too glad to share his responsibility.The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal met with much support and general sympathy, but a numberof difficulties were raised.      The first of these wasthe reaction on the Dominions, particularly Canada and australia, both of which had considerable Dollar Loansin America.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was advised by the Governor of the Bank of England that theywould probably be able to make a case for the adoptionof a different procedure.The Cabinet were also reminded of political difficulties that would arise in the House of Commons.It was pointed out that commercial firms were already taking advantage of the change in the American law.This fact, it was suggested, was likely to be used inParliament as an argument against the course proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.      It was said alsothat the benefit of the bonus would be reaped by speculators:also thattiiis was a gesture to the Gold Countries whichwould not be popular in the House of Commons at thepresent time.     Another argument likely to be used inthe House of Commons was that by almost universal agree-ment the world was sinking under the weight of itsdebts;    that the Americans had given an opportunity ofobtaining some relief;    and that it would be wrong notto avail ourselves of it.      To that we should have tor (d).
reply that we did not like to take advantage of an act of doubtful commercial morality.The Cabinet were reminded that when the F renchdevaluated the Franc the British public were largeholders of rentes.     An appeal was made to the FrenchGovernment to deal differently with the British holders,but they refused.      Then an appeal was made to theBritish Government to take over the obligation, butthey were unable to accept,  and in the end the Britishholders had suffered.The Cabinet&apos;s attention was also drawn to thefact that foreign holders of Sterling gilt-edgedsecurities had suffered heavily when we went off Gold,without receiving compensation.      It was suggested,however, that there was a difference between taking advantage of our own law and of a foreign law, thehonesty of which was felt in this country to be doubtful.      It was suggested that we ought not to takeadvantage of American interference in the relationsbetween ourselves and our creditors.It was recalled that the largest economy that theGovernment had been able to effect was the conversionof the Debt, and that could not have been carried outexcept for our reputation for financial integrity.In fact, rectitude had a cash value.A suggestion was made that as payment in GoldDollars had become impossible owing to AmericanLegislation, payment might be made in the alternativeoption allowed to Bondholders, namely, payment in paper Dollars at a value of 4.86.      This, it wassuggested, would not involve very much loss to theTreasury even at the present time, and,  if the Dollar.1(e).
continued to fall, might work out in our favour.As there was no question of a Financial resolution to he introduced the same evening, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer agreed that the subject should be adjourned until the regular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet onWednesday, July 19th.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1*July 17th, 1933.
ARMISTICE DAY.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(31). Con-clusion 4.)2,   The Cabinet authorised the Home Secretary tomake the same arrangements for the celebration of armistice Day as in previous years.FA
INDIA.PoliticalSituationin.Mr Gandhi.(previous reference:Cabinet 45(55), Con-elusion 6.)a fa)13. The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that he had to.make a speech on India thesame afternoon and proposed to refer to Mr Gandhi&apos;request for an interview with the Viceroy.   TheCabinet would have seen in the Press that Mr Gandhihad acted precipitately.    If his colleagues agreed,the Secretary of State proposed to read out the telegram sent by the Viceroy to Mr Gandhi, to theeffect that if a different kind of telegram had beensent, Mr Gandhifs request might have been taken intoconsideration, but that as he now proposed negotiationaccompanied by a threat of civil disorder there couldbe no question of granting an interview,^he Cabinet agreed to the action proposed by the Secretary of State.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 17, 1935,
