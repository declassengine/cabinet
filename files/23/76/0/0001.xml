RUSSIA,Trial ofBritishSubjects.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(33)   Con-elusion 1.)THE RUSSIA!-!aoODS (import prohibition)ACT .(previous reference:Cabinet 27(33)    Con-clusion 3.)1.   The Cabinet met, as a matter of urgency, toconsider the position arising out of the trial ofBritish prisoners in Moscow.   A large number of tele-grams from the British Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires at Moscow hadbeen circulated.At the outset of the Meeting the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs handed round a note giving his view as to the probable results of the trial andhis recommendations as to action to be taken in thevarious contingencies that might arise (Appendix) .Prom this note it will be seen that, according to theinformation received by the Foreign Office, theSecretary of State anticipated that while Mr Gregorywas likely to be acquitted, the other five engineerswould be convicted and sentenced.   The Secretary ofState made a verbal statement on the lines of his note.The various points in the Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum were discussed seriatim.Discussion took place as to his suggestion thatif the sentence, instead of involving imprisonment,was one of expulsion from Russia forthwith, we could take no action under the Russian Goods (import Prohibi-tion) Act.    In view of the information from Moscowthis result was felt to be very unlikely in the firstinstance, whatever might happen subsequently.    some members of the Cabinet felt that even if no sentencewere inflicted, it would be intolerable, after the wayBritish subjects and the British Government had beenhumiliated in this trial, to leave matters where theywere.    In view, however, of the explicit undertaking given to the House of Commons by the President of theBoard of Trade that the powers under the Act would notbe used for any other purpose than to secure the lives and. liberty of these men, it was generally agreed that
no action could be taken under the Act without freshauthority from Parliament.    It might be in fact thatit would be better to take action outside the Act,The question might have to be considered as to whetherdiplomatic relations ought not to be severed:   whetherBritish subjects could be encouraged to do business with a country where British nationals were exposed to humiliation, insult and intolerable injustice:whether the Russian trading concerns here, particularly the R.O.P., should be allowed to remain:    and whetherthe whole system, of export credits to Russia ought notto be abolished.    In the unlikely event of a sentence of expulsion from Russia, therefore, it was thoughtbetter that the matter should be considered at thenext Meeting of the Cabinet,There was general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s view that if there are sentences of actualimprisonment a Proclamation should be issued at once,and that even if some of the five were merely expelledwhile Macdonald and Thornton were imprisoned, theGovernment must still issue the Proclamation.Disappointment was expressed at the bad impressionMr Thornton appeared to have made on British and foreignopinion in Moscow, but nevertheless in all the circum-stances it was felt that public opinion would expect-a Proclamation to be issued, even if only one of the prisoners received a sentence of imprisonment.Parliament might be told, however, that it would be withdrawn if redress were given,.Some discussion took place as to the nature ofthe Proclamation, and Sir Horace Hamilton (the Perman-ent Secretary to the Board of Trade) and Mr Palmer(of the Board of Trade) attended to give expertexplanations.
Sir Horace Hamilton explained that the list ofarticles suggested by the President of the Board ofTrade in C.P.-101 (33) represented in 1931 nearly 80per cent, of all imports from the Soviet Union.   Thefigure might be slightly lower for 1932.   The excludedarticles would comprise rather a long list.   Administra-tively their inclusion would be very inconvenient, ascertificates of origin would have to be obtained, andthis would handicap the trade of countries contiguousto Russia.    flax had been omitted,, in the interest ofthe^ industry of Scotland and Northern Ireland.    If SovietRussia were to retaliate by prohibiting the export of flax to the United Kingdom, our industry would be badlyhit.    The Cabinet thought it probable, however, thatflax would be obtainable through indirect channels .With the assistance of the Board of Trade Expertsthe Cabinet examined the articles of Russian importsomitted from those included in the Proclamation.As the result of this examination the Cabinetaccepted the view of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the President of the Board of Trade that the proclamation should be extensive, and that; it should bemade to operate after the interval of a week, in orderto give time for the arrival of goods that had alreadyleft Russia, and thus to avoid the issue of great numbersof licences.The Cabinet felt strongly that the least possible delay should elapse between the announcement of the sentences and the issue of the Proclamation.During the Meeting information was received from moscow to the effect that the Court had retired at.3C p.m, (Russian Time) to consider its decision, andthat the five men on bail had been instructed to report at 11.30 p.m.(Russian Time:    say 9.30 p.m. Greenwich time)-3-
when the result of the trial would be announced.    Inthe circumstances the Cabinet felt that a Council oughtto be held, if possible,  early the following morning to approve the Proclamation.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That if the sentence,  instead ofinvolving imprisonment, was one ofexpulsion from Russia applicable toall the prisoners, we could take no action under the Russian Goods(Import Prohibition) Act owing tothe nature of the pledge given tothe House of Commons that the powers under that Act would not be used forany other purpose than to secure the lives and liberty of these men.    Inthe unlikely event of such a sentence,the action to be taken should beconsidered at the next Meeting of theC ab inet:(b) ^hat if   as seems more probable, thereare sentences of actual imprisonmenton any of the prisoners, a Proclama-tion should be issued at once:(c) That the Proclamation should beextensive and should cover all thearticles proposed by the Presidentof the Board of Trade in CP.-101(33), viz.,Butter,Wheat in grain,Barley,Oats ,Maize,Poultry and game,Raw Cotton,Petroleum,Timber (including sleepers,pitprops and manufacturesof timber, that is, plywoodand builders&apos; woodwork) .(d) That the Proclamation should follow the news of the sentence with the smallestpossible interval, that  is to say,  if practicable, it should be made on the morning of the following day, Wednesday,April 19th:(e) That the Proclamation should operateafter the interval of a week:    that isto say, as from Wednesday, April 26th:(f) That the Secretary to the Cabinet should notify members of the Cabinet present atthis Meeting, the same evening, of theresult of the trial:
(g) That if there should be a sentence of death on any of the prisonersthe Cabinet should be summoned againas soon as possible.(NOTE:    His Majesty the King has decidedto hold a Council on Wednesday,April 19th, at 9.30 a ,m,, atWindsor Castle, unless the sentences render this unnecessary,)
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 18, 1933.NEXT MEETING 2.   The Lord President of the Council saidOP CABINET.that unless an emergency Meeting of the Cabinet were required in the interval, the next Meeting would beheld on Wednesday, April 26th,. at 11 a.m.*  *  *
APPENDIX.CABINET.THE VICKERS TRIAL.1. We must assume that, while Gregory is acquitted,the other five engineers will he convicted and sentenced.The probability seems to be that they will fee sentenced,at any rate in the first instance, to terms of imprisonment -there is of course the possibility that the sentence mightbe commuted later on to expulsion from Russia which wouldgive these men their liberty in the end.2. If, in view of the warning I gave to Maisky whichhas been communicated to Litvinov, the sentence, insteadof involving imprisonment, was one of expulsion from Russiaforthwith, we could take no action under the Russian Goods(Import Prohibition) Bill.     For the Government pledge tothe House of Commons was explicit that we would not use thepowers under that Bill for any other purpose than to securethe life and liberty of these men.     If, on the other hand,as seems more probable, there are sentences of actualimprisonment, my view is that we must issue a proclamationat once.     Even if some of the five are merely expelled, whileMacDonald and Thornton are imprisoned, we must still issue the proclamation.     Thornton has certainly not cut a creditablefigure, especially as he has signed completely false accusationsagainst other Englishmen, but it is impossible to judge the pressure under which he so acted.     MacDonald does not seem tobe a satisfactory person either, but the withdrawal after an adjournment of the Court of his previous declaration ofinnocence is an eloquent indication of the pressure that musthave been put on him.     I do not think any of my colleagues will be disposed to judge any of these engineers harshly and   &apos;CO
everyone of them is entitled to all the help we can give,3. In my view the proclamation should he extensive.I suggest that it should cover all the products mentionedin Mr. Runciman&apos;s memorandum of April 10th - &quot;butter, wheat in grain, &quot;barley, oats, maize, poultry and game, raw cotton, petroleum and timber.     These items account for 25,000,000 sterling of Russian imports a year.      I note that furs and flax are not included.      Is this right?4. It seems to me vital that the proclamation should follow the news of the sentence with the smallest possibleinterval.      I have ascertained from Sir Clive Wigram thata Council could be held at Windsor to-morrow afternoon atany time after 5.      It would be possible to announce theintention to issue such a proclamation even before that,but not of course until the result of the trial is known.I agree that the proclamation should be stated to operateafter the interval of a week, not only from the adminis-trative reasons given &quot;by the President of the Board ofTrade, but because (a) this gives the Soviet government week to reflect whether they will not commute the sentences forthwith to banishment and (b) if they do not do so and negotiations subsequently take place, I should like to be able to stipulate that the prisoners mustarrive in England safe and sound first and that the proclamation will be withdrawn one week afterwards.     Asregards (a) Sir E. Ovey points out to me that the SovietGovernment can prevent any knowledge of the proclamationreaching the Russian masses and the adverse reaction whichmight arise from a prospective embargo is thereforediminished.5. One very important reason for making the proclama-tion widespread and stopping all important branches ofRussian imports here, i3&apos; pointed out by my Foreign Office
advisers.     Russian balances here are rapidly drawn on by the Soviet Government to pay for purchases from other foreign countries, especially Germany,and it is the viewof my advisers that if the proclamation is sufficientlywide, it is very improbable that Soviet Russia could standthe strain for more than a month.     Germany would put the strongest pressure on the Soviet, for Germany would be unable to sell and would be forced to cut off supplies to the Soviet if the reservoir for payment dried up.6. I find the whole Soviet mentality so incalculableand incomprehensible that I do not feel confident that asatisfactory result will come out of all this, but I amentirely clear that there is no other course to be taken and we ought to take this course very promptly and boldly.18th April,  1955.
