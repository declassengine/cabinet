The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that-the Cabinet were no doubt aware of the decision reached by the Bureau of the Monetary and EconomicConference on the previous day, after laboriousdiscussions, that each Sub-Commission should be requested to meet as soon as possible to draw up alist of the questions which could in present circxim-stances be usefully studied by them.   The CommissionsMonetarywere now considering the question.   At/Sub-Commission Ihe had urged that the various items should be pursued.   M. Bonnet had then made a long speech,which had been received with applause   more,perhaps, owing to the speech than to the substance.Afterwards M, Bonnet had told him that he was in adisagreeable position.

Similarly it was decided, withouta separate meeting, that Sub-Commission IIIB.(Indirect Protectionism) should resume its work at once.     The question of continuing thediscussion of Subsidies had been referred to theSub-Commission (Sub-Commission IIIA.).Subsequently this Sub-Commission decided by amajority of 13 to 8 that it was desirable tocontinue its work.     At Sub-Commission I, on commercial Policy (Quotas, Tariffs, etc.) theFrench Delegation had led off as though theywere the leaders of a team.

The Chairman had tried to secure the appointment of a Drafting Committeeto make a reasoned statement of the position, but without success.   M. Colijn had also urged that the secretariat side of the Sub-Commissions should bekept in being, so as to provide the necessary data.The Frcnoh, howe^ei?, would have nothing to do with th-eM. Colijn said, that he must report the matter in hisown way.    The Sub-Commission had not adjourned untilXH&quot; p.m.   M. Colijn was coming to see the President ofthe Board of Trade that afternoon with a draft of hiss t a t erne nt.   A-^mar^j^eaHfet^^ .fefefeared that not much progress could be made withimportant European countries on the G old Standardholding divergent views.The Prime Minister said that he had had hisusual conversation with Presidents and Vice-Presidentsand had spoken rather plainly.   There were threesections in that body:-   the Americans, who thought they ought to lead the Conference in their own way;the countries in the Gold bloc, who had been forcedto accept yesterday&apos;s compromise but were now opposingprogress in Commissions;   and ourselves.   We had to stand up to both.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairscommented on the remarkable support that the dominions had given the United Kingdom Delegation,
The Secretary of State for India said that, ashead of the Indian Delegation,. he was not able tokeep in close to-uch with the Conference owing to hispreoccupations with the Joint Select Committee on india.   He relied for information mainly on histechnical adviser. Sir Henry Strakosch.   He gathered from this informant that the Dominions had put forward a series of resolutions which they wanted the UnitedKingdom to adopt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought thatthese resolutions had been prompted by Sir HenryStrakosch, who was the only real expert in the BritishDelegations from overseas.   He thought it probablethat Sir Henry Strakosch had. prompted the Dominions&apos;resolution put forward by General Smuts.   The firstresolution was in favour of raising prices, and thelast resolution advocated cheap and plentiful short and long term credits, public works expenditure on loan account, and a reduction in the level of taxation.That really meant that we should be expected toundertake these proposals, as the Dominions could not do sufficient to produce much effect on the world.The Chancellor had then explained that this was notpart of our policy, and General Smuts had withdrawnthe resolution.   This morning, however, General smuts had reversed his policy.   After previously supportingPresident roosevelt&apos;s ideas he was now urging us to do anything we could to induce President Roosevelt toput the brake on the fall of the Dollar.   The Chancellorthought it probable that Sir Henry Strakosch promptedthe Dominions&apos; attitude in these matters.The Secretary of State for India said that, fromthe point of view of India, public works would be useful.   There were several schemes, ready:    for example.
railway developments.   He had warned Sir HenryStrakosch, however, that he himself was not onlyHead of the Indian Delegation, but also a member ofthe Cabinet.The Minister of Labour thought that General Smuts&apos;resolution was a verbatim copy of a resolution adopted&apos;by the International Labour Organisation.The Prime Minister said that it had been decidedthat morning that the International Labour organisation should be heard by the Economic Commission.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat M. Colijn had said that the Commission ought tohave a discussion on public works.The Prime Minister said that this differed from what M. Colijn had told him that morning,   ^he intentionthen had been only to hear the International LabourOrganisation without having a discussion for some timeto come.The Prime Minister said that the Bureau would meet again on Monday to decide what subjects were tobe taken up by the Sub-Commissions.    He hoped he wasvoicing the view of the Cabinet in saying that our policy should be to make the list of subjects aselastic as possible and to go ahead with the work ofthe Conference as actively as possible.This was agreed to.
THE monetary and ECONOMICCONFERENCE.forthcoming debate inParliament .(previous reference:Cabinet 44(33), Con-clusion 1.)FA.2.   The Prime Minister said that a Debate onthe Monetary and Economic Conference would take placeon Monday, July 10th.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should open the Debate for the Govern-ment, and that the President of theBoard of Trade should be prepared totake part in the Debate.   As it was a supply day the Chancellor of theExchequer could wind up the Debateif necessary:(b) That the Prime Minister, since he wasPresident of the World Conference andnot Leader of the United kingdom delegation, should not be drawn intothe Debate unless reflections were madeon the Conference itself:(c) That as many members of the UnitedKingdom Delegation as possible shouldbe present at the Debate.-5-
MALTA.Italianropaganda(previous ReferencerI Cabinet 22I (35), Con-f elusion 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-174(33)) on the subject of Italian propaganda in Malta,which had grown in volume since the Cabinet last considered the matter.   Bearing in mind the improvedrelations now existing with the Italian Governmentfollowing the visit of the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Rome inMarch, coupled with the successful issue of theFour-Power Pact negotiations, the Cabinet were invitedto approve the following measures with a view to immediate action on lines to which they had already agreed  (l) The enactment of an Ordinance by theGovernor of Malta in the terms of adraft attached as Appendix I to cp.-174 (.33), laying down, inter alia,that no alien shall without licenceengage in certain specified activitiessuch as teaching in schools or beingconcerned in the organisation ormanagement of any institution.   IfS, Mussolini refuses to help inending Italian propaganda in Malta,the Governor will bring the Ordinanceinto operation and use it to compel. the closing or restriction ofobjectionable institutions .   Warningsby the Governor to his Ministers arealso contemplated in certain circum-stances:(ii) The despatch of instructions toSir R.Graham acquainting him withthe whole   position and instructing him as to the representations he isto make to S, Mussolini (Appendix IIto the above Memorandum):(iii) To authorise His Majesty&apos;s Ministerat the Vatican to act on a proposal of the Governor of Malta that the holy See should be invited to take steps to strengthen British asagainst Italian influence in the religious Orders which give instruc-tion in Malta.
The Cabinet were informed that the action nowproposed conformed and gave effect to their previous decision mentioned in the margin.In the course of the discussion the Prime Ministermentioned that he had received a very cordial personal telegram from S. Mussolini to thank him for the arrange-ments made at Londonderry for the reception of GeneralBalbo and his force of aircraft engaged in a Trans-atlantic flight.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention tothe suggestion in paragraph 6 of the Memorandum attachedto CP.-174 (33) that &quot;if His Majesty&apos;s Government seefit to close Italian schools which are voluntarilydispensing education at nominal fees, they should atleast provide equal facilities themselves without charge to the Maltese Exchequer&quot;.   He demurred to thesuggestion that when educational facilities in Maltawere &quot;being reduced owing to Italian propaganda theBritish taxpayer should be asked to pay compensationfor their suppression.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said hewas not asking for a decision on this point, but had felt bound to mention it.   The Secretary of State forWar, he said, had also written to him on the subject,as the War Office were affected.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposals setforth by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies in CP.-174 (33),subject to the following alterations in procedure
(b) The first step should be to approachS. Mussolini.   His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Rome should be asked not to notifyS, Mussolini of the details of theaction it was proposed to take at malta when first opening up thesubject, lest this might tend to arouse opposition, but should ratherseek to enlist his support .   Some days later, however, if necessary, heshould have discretion to inform him of the nature of the Ordinance to beissued.   This would involve some.amendments to the draft Despatchattached to C.P.-174 (33)  (e,g,,paragraphs 4, 6, 7 and 9);(c) That the Governor of Malta should notpass the secret Ordinance or informMaltese Ministers of what was proposeduntil he was given instructions to doso by the Secretary of State for theColonies.
tHB (MALTESE)CRTMINAL LAW^ENDMENT BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 68(32), Con-clusion 2.)4. The Secretary of State for the Coloniesrecalled that at the Meeting referred to in the margin the-   Cabinet had approved his proposal forinstructing the Governor of Malta to exercise his powers of reservation in respect of the Bill to amend the Criminal Laws referred to therein, and, afterreservation, of advising His Majesty not to signifyhis assent to it.   The Governor had now reportedthat the Bill had passed unanimously through bothHouses of Parliament.   The penalties, however, were reduced to about one-half of what they were originally,/VA smaller penalty was imposed in respect of publicdLtu*tu2\uL      \ villi:fyin8 0:? any cult tolerated by law comparedwith that in respect of the Roman Catholic religion^The Bill was a foolish one, but in the form in whichit was passed it was not likely to do any harm, as there were few, if any, Protestants in the Islandapart from the Defence Services and a small Britishcolony.   In the circumstances he asked the Cabinetto reverse their previous decision and to permit himto telegraph to the Governor not to refuse assent.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to instruct theGovernor of Malta not to refuseassent to the Criminal Law amendment bill:(b) That the Governor should be askedto watch the working of the bill and report to the Secretary of State.
-gw GOVERNMENTUILEINGS IN-I^FHALL ENDINBURGH .(previous reference:Cabinet 35(33), Con-elusion 6,)F.R.$$(sty-5, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Commissioner of Works (CP,-162 (33)) on thesubject of new Government buildings in Whitehall and edinburgh, in which it was stated that the stage hadbeen reached when architects must be appointed, andthat the best results were likely to be achieved by direct choice of architects rather than by making a selection from a number of designs submitted either in open or in limited competition.   He accordingly proposed to ask the President of the Royal institute of British Architects to submit a panel of the names of eight or ten architects who would be prepared toaccept a commission for the new building in Whitehall.These names would go before a Selection committee consisting of, say.The First -Commissioner of Works (Chairman),The Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commis-sion for England and Wales,The Chief Architect of His Majesty&apos;office  of Works,The President of the Royal institute of British Architects,The President of the Royal Academy,who, after a careful examination of their work and records, would select the architect considered to be most suitable,   ^he architect&apos;s appointment would thenbe made, on terms to be settled with the Treasury inthe usual way and subject to precise conditions regardingcontrol of design, structure, finance, etc.   The first commissioner proposed that the procedure outlined above should also be followed, mutatis mutandis. in the caseof the central Government building scheme in Edinburgh,the separate panel for selecting the architect for theScottish buildings to be a matter of agreement betweenthe Secretary of State for Scotland and himself.   Havingregard to the architectural and national importance ofthese Government building schemes, the First Commis-sioner desired the approval of his colleagues for thecourse he proposed. -10-
The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet of a previous decision that no buildingcommitment was to be entered into without a cabinet decision.   He was willing to agree with the first commissioner of Works&apos; proposals so far as the whithall Gardens and Montagu House scheme was con-cerned.   He was more doubtful, however, as tic theEdinburgh building, as it was estimated that &quot;theemployment of an outside architect would involve an expenditure of  50,000 more than if the work were undertaken by the Office of Works .The Secretary of State for Scotland made strong representations that, in view of the interest takenin Scotland in this building, which was the firstimportant Government building to be erected in edinburgh for a very long time, public opinion therewould not stand the employment of an Office of Worksarchitect for Edinburgh, especially when an outsidearchitect was to be selected for England.The Cabinet accepted this view.On the understanding that no building commitmentwas entered into without a Cabinet decision, theCabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals submittedby the First Commissioner of Workson the subject of new government buildings in Whitehall and Edinburgh,as set forth in CP.-162 (33), subjectto the following minor alteration:-(b) That the Council, instead of thePresident, of the Royal institute of British Architects should be askedto submit a panel of architects whowould be prepared to accept a commission for the new building in Whitehall and. Edinburgh:    and that the Presidentof the Royal Institute of BritishArchitects should be a member of the selection Committee.
LnTON AND 6. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theNation opMENTS. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.p.-175 (33))Disarma- covering a Memorandum by the Parliamentary Under-confer-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the questionus ion 2.)f.r.of future procedtire on disarmament.    In this Memorandumeviousference: it was stated that Mr Henderson, the President of thebinet 423), Con- Disarmament Conference, was about to begin a disarma-ment tour with a view to reaching agreement by provate conversations now that public discussion haa failed.Mr Henderson had indicated his desire that the UnitedKingdom Government, as author of the Draft Convention,should be represented at these conversationst andthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State suggestedthat if and when Mr Henderson appealed for the ass ist-ance of a British representative, Mr Cadogan should attend in the first instance, with authority to askMr Eden to join him when he considered it necessary.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat the general line indicated by Mr Eden might be. pursued.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had received a letter from the Secretary of Statefor War who was unable to be present at the Cabinetthat afternoon.Lord Hailsham did not want to object to theForeign Office sending a representative to watch anyconversation if they thought it useful, but had expressed some anxiety lest the representative shouldbe drawn into discussions tending to lead away fromprevious Cabinet decisions.The First Lord of the Admiralty shared theSecretary of State for War*s apprehensions.     he recalled the decision of the Ministerial Committee which-12-
was taken note of by the Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin -&quot;That we are not prepared to agreeto alterations being made to isolatedparts of our Plan while the fundamentaldifficulties between France and Germanystill remain,.....&quot;He hoped, therefore, that the Foreign Officerepresentative would on no account be drawn into negotiations.       On the Naval Chapter there was nothing to negotiate.     France might want another&quot;Dxmquerque&quot; and might want to do a deal in that respect, but this would upset the Italians.The Prime Minister said he, too, had written a minute indicating his apprehension that if Mr.Henderson was confronted with a negative attitudehe would turn to the Foreign Office representative and ask if we could do anything to help the situation,which might result in our being drawn into detailed discussions.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that he and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had seen Mr, Henderson and he thought thatthey had made our attitude clear.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs readan extract from his record of the conversation,referred to by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, including the following extracts -&quot;Mr. Henderson said that it had occurred to  him that as His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad submitted the draft Convention to theDisarmament Conference, it might be well that a member of the British delegation should accompany him.     Mr. Thomas admitted that this might possibly give rise to somesuspicion and misunderstanding;    it would throw doubt on the President&apos;s true positionas an impartial Chairman.     It was, there-fore, a matter that would have to be very carefully consideredMr. Henderson was told -&quot;If by his conversations, Mr, Hendersoncould secure a likely basis for Franco-german agreement, His Majesty&apos;e Gpvernment would beprepared to give sympathetic consideration-15-
to all these matters, hut they were notprepared to make further piecemeal concessions in advance of such a prospective accord.&quot;The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that Mr. Henderson&apos;s view was that his conversation would he a continuation of the Parisconversations, and he was aware that we could not make any concessions in Paris.The Prime Minister said that the representativeof the Foreign Office would attend the conversationsunder close conditions.In the course of the discussion a preference was expressed for attendance by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State rather than an official representa-tive in view of the considerations involved.A suggestion was made that,as the question of inspection was one of the most acute between theFrench Government and ourselves, the Secretary of Statefor War might take some opportunity to visit paris and to discuss this subject.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve generally the proposal ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in CP. 175(33) , a preference being expressed that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState should, if possible, attend in person.
7.     The Cabinet again had before them thefollowing documents on the subject of responsibilityfor Persian Gulf affairs, briefly summarised at thehead of the Cabinet Conclusion mentioned in the marginA Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (CP. 154 (33)):A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. 156 (33)):A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (CP. 165(33))..The question of the future responsibilityfor the Persian Gulf affairs was postponed.
EGYPT. 8,      The Prime Minister said that before the recess it would be necessary for the Cabinet toResumptionof Treaty dispose of the question of the Resumption of negotiations.Treaty Negotiations with Egypt.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(33), Con-clusion 3).F.R.
