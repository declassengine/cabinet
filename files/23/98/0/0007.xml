CONCLUSIONS of a meeting of the Cabinet heldin the Prime Minister&apos;s Room, House of commons on FRIDAY,  31st MARCH, 1939,  at 12 noon.CONTENTS.Subject. PagTHE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION:Poland. ^ 1Position as to Russia. 5
iics inter-situation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought itwas only right, in view of observations which hadPoland.&quot;been made at the previous Meeting, that the Cabinet(Previousshould have an opportunity of seeing the proposed reference:Cabinet 16(39), Con-elusion 1.)Statement before a final decision was reached inregard to it.This had been one reason, among others,which had influenced him in postponing the. publicationof the Statement until that afternoon.The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues thatat the Meeting held on the previous day, the cabinet had authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign.Affairs to despatch telegrams forthwith to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Warsaw and Paris, and theForeign Policy Committee to settle the terms of aStatement to be made in Parliament in the light of the replies received to those telegrams0   The ForeignPolicy Committee had accordingly met the. previous afternoon and had prepared a draft Statement, but ithad been decided to hold another Meeting at 9*45 a.rrwtoday to give further consideration to the Statement,,when the replies to the two telegrams had beenreceived0The Prime Minister said that in the course of theprevious afternoon he had seen Mr. Greenwood andSir Archibald Sinclair, and had reported the positionto them.   They had both said that they were afraid that trouble would be, raised in certain quarters, onthe, ground that the action taken by the government did not include Russia,0   They had urged him toInclude in his Statement, some reference to Russia.In reply to this the Prime Minister had explainedthat the present arrangement, was only intended tocover the interim period, and that the position inregard to Russia would no doubt be cleared up during
Colonel Beck!s visit to this country.   Further, itwas essential to obtain quick results and not to &apos;complicate the position unduly.   The opposition leaders had seen this point, but they had neverthelesssaid that they were afraid that there might be somerather heated Supplementary Questions, and had pressed the Prime Minister to include a passage inhis Statement to the effect that Russia had been consulted.   To this he (the Prime  Minister) had replied that the Secretary of State for Foreign   Affairsintended to see the Soviet Ambassador on Fridaymorning before the Statement was made.Shortly before 10 p.m. on the previous eveningthe replies to the telegrams to Paris and Warsaw hadbeen received.    Both the French and Polish governments had expressed agreement with our proposal.Shortly after 10 p.m., he (the Prime Minister)had been asked to see three leaders of the labour opposition, viz., Mr. Greenwood, Dr. Dalton andMr. Alexander.  While the former    had throughoutadopted a helpful attitude the two latter represented the pro-Russian section of the Labour Party.   They came to report strong objections to any action being taken which would imply that Russia was being left on one side.   The Prime Minister said that he had :sepaated*the arguments which he had previously used toMr. Greenwood and Sir Archibald Sinclair, includingthe fact that the Foreign Secretary was to seeMo Maisky at 10.30 the next morning.    They had thenpointed out that this interview would take place avery short time before the Statement, if it was tobe made at 11 o&apos;clock, and had pressed him to postpone making the Statement until later in the day*
Continuing, the Prime Minister said that at firsthe had been unwilling to agree to any postponement,since he was afraid of leakage of the news from Paris.As, however, full particulars of the action whichwe had taken had appeared in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; andother newspapers that morning, this reason forpostponement no longer held good..  He also thoughtthat it would be desirable to spend some further timein considering the draft.The Prime Minister said that further enquirieshad failed to confirm the alleged German troop movements.     The telegram from Prance received theprevious night stated that the French Government didnot apprehend any imminent coup on the part ofGermany.     In consequence he felt that it was undesirable that the proposed Statement should be madeto rest too much on the prevalence of rumours.     TheQuestion had therefore been re-drafted as follows:-&quot;To ask -the Prime Minister whether he could make any statement as to the Europeansituation.&quot;He had replied at 11 o&apos;clock that morning to theeffect that he would prefer to make a statement later in the day, and in reply to a Supplementary he had stated that there was no official confirmation ofrumours of any projected attack on Poland, and thatthe Government must no t    be    taken as accepting them as true.     This answer had been given in order toavoid any risk of a heavy fall in prices in the City.The Prime Minister said that the draft statement had also been modified so as to make it relate more
directly to the interim period, pending conclusionof the consultations which were now proceeding withother Governments.     This made the Statement rather less final and weighty, and left us rather moreleverage to obtain a reciprocal undertaking from poland.The draft Statement (a copy of which is appended to these Conclusions) was at this point circulatedto the Cabinet.THE PRII.E MINISTER then read the Statement and made a number of comments on it.He pointed out that the second paragraph nowtook the form of a general statement, not specifically directed to relations between Germanyand Poland.The operative part of the Statement was in thethird paragraph, and it would be seen that twoconditions must be fulfilled before His LIa;jesty&apos;sGovernment felt bound to lend all support in their power to Poland.     These conditions were, first,that the action taken must clearly threaten Polishindependence.     It would, of course, be for us todetermine what action threatened Polish independence,and this left us some freedom for manoeuvre.The second condition was that the threat toPolish independence was one which the PolishGovernment considered it vital to resist with hernational forces.     This would prevent us becomingembroiled as the result of a mere   frontierincident.     He thought that the   position was nowsafeguarded   as far as was possible, consistently with the declaration attaining its object;
Discussion then ensued, as to the attitude which was likely to be adopted by the opposition parties in regard to Russia and what answers could begiven to the questions which they were likely to put.One suggestion was that a supplementary question might be put asking whether there had been consultationwith other Governments, including Russia.,     To thisan affirmative answer could be given.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wouldcertainly be asked whether the Russian Government hadbeen informed of the action which we had taken.     Whatanswer should he give?THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had notbeen able to see M, Maisky that morning as the soviet ambassador was not available.     He hoped to see himbefore 3 o&apos;clock.     If this was not possible, he intended to send a telephone message to Moscow.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought he wouldalso be asked whether the Russian Government had offered to join in this undertaking, and whether wehad asked them to give any undertaking.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thoughtsuch questions could be answered by saying that thepresent was only an interim arrangement and that theinclusion of Russia was a matter which it was intendedto deal with in the discussions next week.     He addedthat he understood that a representative of the Polishminers was now over here, and had conveyed to theLabour Opposition quite definitely the unfavourableviews which were held in Poland regarding Russia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtthat the Labour Party felt that the Government wereprejudiced against Russia and were neglecting a possiblesource of help.     He thought that his answers to
Supplementaries would have to depend on the results ofthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s interview vith M. Maisky.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he was anticipating that M. Maisky wouldexpress himself at the interview as perfectly satisfiedand would say that the Russians were willing to help us if they were allowed to do so.     He thought, however,that from the point of view of Poland, it would he goingtoo far to say that our proposal had been communicated tothe Russian Ambassador, who had expressed completesatisfaction.     He thought that it would be safer tosay that the position had been fully explained to theRussian Government, and that there was no misunderstandingbetween the two Governments.THE HOME SECRETARY referred to a very moderatearticle on the subject in the Manchester Guardian, and thought that it should be possible to convince publicopinion that we were right to make sure of Poland first.It was agreed that the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary should consult later as to the replies to be given to supplementaries in regard to the positionof Russia, in the light of the  ofeign Secretary&apos;s interview with M. Maisky.In the course of discussion, the question was raised whether, in view of possible embarrassment inregard to supplementary questions regarding Russia, itwould be desirable to postpone the proposed statement that afternoon from 2.45 until 4.0 p.m.In this connection,  THE SECRETARY OF STATE forwar read out a statement summarising the latest
military information.    This showed that Poland hadalready mobilised a considerable number of reservists,and that the indications were that Germany intendedeither to occupy Danzig on the 1st April or tointimidate Poland, at a time when that country appearedto be drawing closer to the Western Powers.The general conclusion was that, in all thecircumstances, it was better to make the statement about 3 orclock and run the risk of a Debate, ratherthan to make a further postponement.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had beeninformed that public opinion in Canada was veryignorant in regard to Poland, and might be surprisedthat we should enter into so binding a commitment inregard to that country.    He enquired whether thispoint could be met by a small amendment of the draft,linking more closely the action taken by H.M.Government and by the Prench Government inthis matter. Amendments in this sense were considered,but it was  finally    decided that the draft should standwithout alteration.    It was pointed out that thestatement was a statement by H. M. Government and it was felt thatthe Prench position was sufficiently emphasised in thefinal paragraph.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he proposed thatthe terms of the statement should be communicatedimmediately to Signor Mussolini so that he might receive them before they were made public.    He also proposed to communicate the statement to the UnitedStates Ambassador in order that he might let thePresident of the United States have it before publication.
This course was agreed to.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said he had heard from the Naval Attache in Berlin that Herr hitler was expected to take the opportunity at the launching of the warship at Wilhelmshaven on Saturday to make a violent anti-British speech.The Cabinet:--(1) Approved the statement to be made bythe Prime Minister that afternoon,as drafted by the Foreign PolicyCommittee.(2) Authorised the communication of thestatement to Signor Mussolini, andto the United States Ambassador,forthwith, before the statement wasmade in the House.(3) Authorised the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary to decide theline to be adopted in regard to possible supplementary questions as to the position of Russia, inthe light of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s interview with M. Maisky.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.31st March, 1939.
APPENDIX.Quest!on.    To ask the Prime Minister whether he can now make a statement as to the European situation.Answer. As I said this morning His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave no official confirmation of the rumours of anyprojected attack on Poland and they must not thereforehe taken as accepting them as true.I am glad to take this opportunity of statingagain the general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.      Theyhave constantly advocated the adjustment, by way of freenegotiation between the parties concerned, of any differences that may arise between them.      They considerthat this is the natural and proper course wheredifferences exist.      In their opinion there should be noquestion incapable of solution by peaceful means and theywould see no justification for the substitution of force or threats of force for the method of negotiation.As the House is aware,  certain consultationsare now proceeding with other Governments.      In order tomake perfectly clear the position of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the meantime before those consultations are concluded, I now have to inform the House that during thatperiod in the event of any action which clearly threatenedPolish independence, and which the Polish government accordinly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty&apos;s Government would feelthemselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government allsupport in their power.      They have given the PolishGovernment an assurance to this effect.I may add that the French Government have authorised   me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty&apos;s Government.
SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION,SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION.Gypher telegram to Sir E. Phipps (Paris).Foreign Office, 50th March, 1939.     3.50 p.m.No.&apos; 114.MOST IMMEDIATE.A question is being asked in the House of Commons tomorrowsuggesting that a German attack on Poland is imminent and asking-what action His Majesty&apos;s Government would take in such a case.We have some reason to apprehend that preparations for a coupagainst Poland may be far advanced and that action may be -imminent.     If anything of the sort occurred, the consequencesmight evidently be very serious unless we had jointly resolvedon action to be taken in such an event.2.    It may take some days yet to conclude with Poland anarrangement such as we have in mind for the defence of poland and Roumania, and we feel it is highly desirable to give timelywarning to the German Government in terms as little provocativeas possible concerning any aggression against Poland.3.    In the meantime therefore, in reply to the parliamentary question, we propose, if French Government concur, to say that wemust not be taken as accepting the rumour of proposed attack astrue, but that we had assured the Polish Government that, ifpending the conclusion of consultations with other Governments,any action were taken which clearly threatened their independence,and which the Polish Government accordingly felt obliged to resistwith their national forces, His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government would at once lend them all the support in their-power.4,   We presume that this would in any case be the attitudeof the French Government, quite apart from the provisions of Franco-Polish alliance.5..  Please ascertain French Governments views urgently and let me know if possible tonight.     I shall further be glad to knowwhether French Government would authorise me to say tomorrow, asI propose, that in this matter their attitude is identical with-vUr own. &apos;Repeated to Warsaw 67, Bucharest 76, Moscow 48 and Berlin 96.
&apos;   SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION.SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION.Cypher telegram to Sir H. Kennard (Warsaw).Foreign Office, March 50th 1959.     4.20 p.m.No. 66.MOST IMMEDIATE.A question is &quot;being asked in the House of Commons tomorrowsuggesting that a German attack on Poland is imminent and askingwhat action His Majesty&apos;s Government would take in such a case.We propose, subject to concurrence of French Government, to reply that we must not he taken as accepting the rumour of a proposed attack as true, but that we had assured Polish Governmentthat if, pending conclusion of consultations with other Governments,any action were taken which clearly threatened their independenceso that they felt bound to resist with their national forces, HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Prench Government would at once lendthem all the support in their power.&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Governmentpresume that this reply would be in accord with Polish Government&apos;swishes.I suggest that you should make this communication in the samequarters as those to which you addressed representations inaccordance with my telegram No.56, and endeavour to obtain immediateexpression of their views - if possible tonight.Repeated to Paris No. 115, Moscow No. 47, Berlin No. 95 andBudapest-No. 75.

(By telephone)     7.50 p.mo     30th March 1939.No. 94.MOST IMM&quot;JDIAT3.Your telegram No. 660Mo Beck agreed without hesitation to proposed reply.2*     In these circumstances any comments on my part may seem redundant more especially as Your Lordship doubtlesspossesses much information not available to me,3*     It is of course unlikely that Polish governmentwould deliberately provoke Germany.     But in present state of feeling here possibility of some impulsive action cannotaltogether be excluded..For instance 12 Danzig Senate declared their return toGermany Polish troops might well enter territory of the freecity.     I venture to suggest insertion of word &quot;unprovoked&quot;before words &quot;action were taken&quot; in proposed reply*     I do not see how M. Beck could object to this addition, should your lordship see fit to make it but I have of course not mentionedsuggestion to hime     Incidentally I might add for what it isworth that both German Ambassador and M. Beck have assured meto-day that German government have not made any demands inthe nature of an ultimatum and that there is no indication,that they intend to take more menacing action in the immediatefuture.Addressed to Foreign Office, repeated to Paris, Berlin,Bucharest and Moscow.
