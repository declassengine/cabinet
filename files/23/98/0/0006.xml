THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSapologised for again calling the Cabinet together and at such short notice,,     His reason for doing sowas that information received on the previous dayappeared to disclose a possible German intention to execute a coup de main against Poland.     Mr. Kennedyhad received a message from the American ambassador at Warsaw to the effect that the Memel episode was generally regarded as reflecting credit on Hsrr von ribbentrop, who was anxious to bring off another coupwhile this country and France were still discussingwhat action they should take.The Foreign Secretary said that he had also had an interview with the Berlin Correspondent of the&quot;News Chronicle&quot;, who was one of two Correspondentsunder sentence of expulsion from Germany.     He had come over to London especially in order to give information which had reached him from various contactsin Germany to the effect that Poland was the nextitem on Germany&apos;s programme of aggression.      Jhisthesis was supported by a good deal of detailed information, including the statement of a localindustrialist that he had had orders to accumulaterations opposite Bromberg by the 28th March.     It wasalso stated that the plan was that Germany should occupy considerable parts of Polish territory, leavingonly a narrow buttress between Germany and Russia.The Correspondent of the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; also quotedtextually the words of a despatch which our military attache at Berlin was sending over, to the effect thathe would be glad to see Great Britain at war WithGermany in the next three months, for unless this
happened, Germany v/ould have absorbed Poland,The Foreign Secretary explained that hisanxiety was, therefore, lest Herr Hitler should make some immediate move.     He hoped that his judgment was notunduly affected by what was necessarily uncertainevidenceo     If, however, there was a danger that herr hitler might act before our major arrangements had been concluded, he thought that we should consider whether wecould take some prior action so as to forestall herr hitler&apos;s next step.     The proposal which he wished toput before his colleagues was that we should make a cleardeclaration of our intention to support Poland if poland was attacked by Germany.     There were two objects inmaking such a statement.     First,  the knowledge that weshould take such action might cause the plan to be suspended and would thus react to the discredit of herr hitler in Army circles;    secondly, when our statementbecame known it would help to educate public opinion in :germany as to the likelihood that Herr Hi tier &apos;s presentcourse of action would result in Germany becoming engagedin war on two front s.Those who were foremost in urging that adeclaration on these lines should be made contended thatsuch action would have great effect on military leaders and persons in important positions in Germany.      TheForeign Secretary thought, however, that it would be rashto attach undue importance to the prospect of any suchresult.The Secretary of State then proceeded to put the objections to this proposal which had occurred to, him.First, that if we were now to make adownright declaration that we should come to Poland1sassistance If attacked,- we gave Colonel Beck what he
Ill 158wanted without obtaining any reciprocal undertaking from him     He had tried to meet this in the draft statement which he had prepared, by explaining thatthe proposed declaration was an interim measureonly, designed to meet what was apprehended to bean immediate threatsThe second objection was that there was some risk of upsetting the prospects of direct agreementbetween Germany and Poland.     Negotiations were inprogress but we did not know how they were proceeding.The third objection was that a declaration onthese lines would be very provocative to Germany, andsomewhat reminiscent of the action taken on the 21stMay, 1938o     The Foreign Secretary said that he had no particular objection to a provocative statement, providedthat it did not land us in an unpleasant situation.The fourth objection was that the draft statement had the appearance of leaving Roumania out of the picture.Finally, the draft statement was rather heroicaction to take, on the meagre information availableto us.     It was, however, fair to say that thesesources of information had been pretty accurate in theprevious autumn, when we had not always been preparedto rely upon thenuThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat there were two other considerations which wouldweigh with the Cabinet.     The first was that M. daladier had just made a statement as to negotiations between france and Italy, and it was desirable not to take any action which would upset the possibilities of a reason-able settlement between France and Italy.   Vcc-- [,   ?.-^-vct*.i.
The second point was that action had now beentaken on the telegrams to Bucharest and Warsaw whichhad been before the Cabinet on the previous day, andit was undesirable to disturb these negotiations.The Secretary of State said that his tentativeconclusion was as follows.     He would like to have adraft statement agreed between ourselves and France,and concerted with the Leaders of the opposition parties.     The Dominions should also be informed ofit.     It would then be possible for this draft state-rnent to be published at a moment&apos;s notice, if thesituation should require it, in consultation withthe French GovernmentaIt was necessary to consider to what extent our action in this matter should be dependent upon theviews of the Polish Government&apos;.     His own judgement in this matter was perhaps somewhat influenced by theview which he took of the Polish Foreign Minister.Nevertheless he thought that it would be necessaryto inform the Polish Government of our intentions soas to give them a chance of expressing their views.      Inthe meantime an endeavour would be made to securefurther information as to the exact position.The Foreign Secretary asked the Cabinet toconsider whether they were prepared to authorisethe Prime Minister and himself to issue a statement on the lines proposed, if circumstances should arise which should render this necessary0
In reply to questions, the Foreign secretary said, that he believed that plans had been prepared byGermany for a number of adventures, including an attackon Poland.    The real question was which adventure Germanyproposed to undertake next and at what date.    He didnot think that what he was now proposing represented anyany material departure from the policy which had beenapproved by the Cabinet on the previous day.    Our policy was to resist Germany&apos;s attempts at domination.    If poland was the next object of aggression, we must face thesituation at once, and the best means of stopping german aggression was almost certainly to make clear that weshould resist it by force.    Asked by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer whether he drew a distinction between aseizure of Danzig by Germany, and a German attack on therest of Poland, the Foreign Secretary said that he thoughtit was difficult to find any better test than the decision by Poland whether to regard such an attack as a threat to her independence which she must resist by force.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he thoughtthat the indications pointed to a coup in regard toDanzig on the Memel model.    He quoted two telegrams datedthe 28th March from H.M. Ambassador at Warsaw and ourConsul at Danzig indicating that the danger appeared tobe limited to Danzig.    While he was clearly of opinionthat we must support Poland if her independence wasthreatened, he thought that we should not encourage poland to go to war with Germany about Danzig.    He also suggestedthat it would be difficult to make a public statement which could not be construed as an attemot by us to
prevent the Germans from trying to absorb Danzig.THE PRIME MINISTER said that under theproposals approved by the Cabinet on the previous day,we were seeking an agreement between Poland, Roumania,Prance and ourselves under which, if Germany tookaction which threatened Polish or Roumanian independence,all the countries concerned would go to the assistanceof the country attacked.    It was true that this undertakingwas subject to certain conditions, but these were not of essential importance.    It was also intended that thisagreement should be made public and should have a deterrent effect.    He thought that the Foreign   Secretary&apos;sproposals amounted to no more than anticipation of actionwhich it was intended to take in certain events.    At thesame time, the action now proposed was a serious stepand was the actual crossing of the stream.    It was right that all his colleagues should consider the mattercarefully before they took any irrevocable step.All that the Foreign Secretary was nowproposing was the preparation of a draft statement.He thought that it would now be appropriate to examinethe statement and to see whether it met the difficultiesreferred to by the Lord Chancellor and the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    It was important to secure that thepublication of the draft statement would not bring usup against a tremendous decision on some point which did not affect the independence of Poland.We were, however, faced with a dilemma.    Ifit was true that Herr Hitler and Herr von Ribbentrop
thought that they could bring off a coup in Polandwithin the next week and face us with a fait accomplibefore we could decide what action we could take, itwas difficult to assess the damage which would result.It had already been pointed out, as a result of theGerman action against Czechoslovakia,  instead of the czech army being on our side, Czech resources were now available to Germany.    It would be a very serious matter if Poland, instead of being a potential ally,also became added to the resources of Germany.    If,therefore, we took no action, there was a risk that,in a short time, we should find that Poland had been over-run and that we had missed an opportunity.On the other hand, if we uttered a warning such as was now proposed, we should be committed to interventionif Germany persisted in aggression.The Prime Minister said that he was somewhatuneasy at the fact that our Ambassador in Warsawcould obtain no information as to the progress of thenegotiations between Germany and Poland.    one possible, but very distasteful, explanation of thiswas that Polish negotiators were,  in fact, giving wayto Germany.    He thought it was of the utmost importance to take all possible steps to ascertain what was happening in these negotiations.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs explained that telegrams had been despatched to Sir HowardKennard urging him to take action from this point of view.
THE MINISTER ^OR-GO ORDINATION OP defence said that the position had been examined from themilitary point of view by the Chiefs of Staff.     Theyhad come to the fairly definite conclusion that, if wehave to fight Germany, it would be better to do bo with poland as an ally, rather than to allow Poland to be absorbed and dominated by Germany without making anyeffort to help her.     N0 doubt it would be impossibleto prevent Poland from being over-run.     The Chiefsof Staff, indeed, thought that Poland would be likelyto be over-run by Germany within two or three months.Nevertheless, Germany would suffer heavy casualties in the process, and would have to leave considerableforces in occupation of Poland.     There had been no discussion with the French as to whether it wasfeasible to make an attack in force on the SiegfriedLine.     In some quarters it was held that this wouldbe impracticable, while in others it was thought thatwe could effect considerable damage^on important centres in Germany.     If we and the French were to go to warin support of Poland, Germany might decide to maskPoland and to direct her main attack on the west.Poland had no fortifications, there were no naturalGerman territory on three sides of her.     Nevertheless,the Chiefs of Staff thought that if Germany were toattack Poland, the right course would be that weshould declare war on Germany.     Poland had 50 Divisionsfeatures in defence of^her territory, and she had
- 9 -and she had 230 bombers which could be used to bomb Berlin, the defence of which would account for a considerable proportion of the GermanfightersoThe Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence said that the Chiefs of Staff assumed that we should not render ourselves liable tobe drawn into war as a result of an act of warcommitted by Poland, without consultation with us.     Further, they assumed that we should onlyfight for the independence of Poland if the Polesresisted and the French were our allies.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIRenquired whether the issue of the proposed statement was to be dependent upon the agreementof the Polish Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that he did not contemplatemaking the statement if the Polish Governmentwere to ask us not to do so, unless he had good reason for thinking that the advice of thePolish Government was suspect^
Asked whether the statement should he made, beforeColonel Beck&apos;s visit, the Foreign Secretary said hethought it was essential that the statement should be ready for immediate use.     We should be exposed to greathumiliation and. should suffer a serious set-back if Germanytook any action against Poland before we were prepared.      Theissue of a statement would also have a deterrent effect.THE&apos; SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS pointed out thatif v/e were now to consult the French and Polish Governments,there was a possibility of leakage, to which the foreign secretary replied that he thought it was unnecessary to show the terms of the proposed statement to the French, havingregard to the existence of the Franco-Polish Treaty.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that the issue ofa statement on the lines proposed would definitely commit usto going to war in the circumstances specified therein. Hethought that it was difficult to justify the issue of such astatement unless we were asked by Poland whether v/e were ready to come to her help if attacked. No such request hadbeen made to us.itude Reference had also been made to the possibility ofItaly.better feeling between France and Italy.     He asked whether any reply had been received to the letter which the PrimeMinister had sent to Signor Mussolini,THE PRIME MINISTER said that no reply had been received,but Count Ciano had sent for Sir Noel Charles and had informed him that Signor Mussolini had received the letter,that he had much appreciated the Prime minister&apos;s action in sending it, that there were certain suggestions which theDuce was turning over in his mind, and that, after consideration of them, he would reply to the letter.-lO
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE asked what would be the effect on Italy of a German attackon Poland, since Italy had always regarded Poland as a country with which she was proud to be on good terms.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought the indications were that Herr Hitler did not intend to be very much influenced by Signor Mussolini1sopinion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said thatwhile he agreed that steps should now be taken to draft the statement for issue at any moment, he thought thatthe Cabinet should consider the matter in the lightof all the circumstances before they agreed to theissue of the statement.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs thought that, if the independence of Poland wasthreatened, it was inconceivable that we should stand aside and see her over-run.    He thought that the realpoint at issue was whether the Polish Government thoughtit desirable to issue the proposed statement at thepresent time in advance of any direct German threat.The issue of such a statement would certainly have a deterrent effect and the most important question wasthe proper time for its issue.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought theissue of a statement at the present time might beregarded as provocative, and might force certainelements in Germany to take action which they would not otherwise have taken.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat France was bound by treaty to Poland; if thereforePoland was attacked and France honoured her obligations,
Germany would ipso facto toe engaged in war on two fronts.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatthe real difficulty &quot;before the Cabinet was to know whatwas behind Polish policy.    The German method was alltoo familiar.    They might threaten to lay Warsaw inruins in a few days with their air force.    It was difficult to know what line Poland would take if facedwith a threat of this kind.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said that the upshot ofthe advice of the Chiefs of Staff was that it was better to fight with Poland as an ally than without her.    Hethought,  therefore, we ought to take steps to ensurethat Poland did resist German aggressiono    There werepro-German and pro-Prench parties in Polish opinion, andwe should do our best to strengthen the latter.    Hethought that there were strong arguments in favour ofissuing a draft statement on the lines proposed, and ensuring that it was brought to the notice of thosewho had to determine. Poland&apos;s policy.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat it had been agreed that, if Germany over-ranRoumania, that would constitute a military threat.    Itmight be questioned whether, if Germany over-ran Poland,that would to the same extent constitute a military threat to us, since Germany would then be faced with Russia on her borders.    He felt, however, that if Poland were attacked, it was politically impossible for us to stand aside.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSadded that if Poland was over-run, there would be nohope of saving Roumania.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thencirculated a draft statement which had been preparedtogether with draft telegrams to our Ambassadors inParis, Warsaw and Bucharest.     ^/copies of these documentsare not appended to these Minutes, but are kept on recordin the Secretary1 s standard file of Cabinet conclusions^The following comments were made on the draft telegrams.On the draft telegram to Warsaw THE PRIME minister thought that the Foreign Secretary would wish to ask the Polish Government whether they had any information that Germany was preparing a sudden coup against Poland,and whether they thought that a declaration such as was proposed would be likely to avert it.     He suggested thata copy of the proposed declaration might be enclosed, as showing the kind of action which we proposed to take,subject to recommendation, in the light of furtherinformation received.In regard to the draft telegram to Paris, THECHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought that Sir Eric Phippsshould be asked to remind the French Government of theexistence of the Franco-Polish Treats^ and say that ifthe French Government intended to support Polishresistance to German aggression in accordance with theterms of that Treaty, we should help them.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the third paragraphmight be re-drafted on the lines of suggesting to theFrench Government how serious the consequences would balfour Germany took action, and we were not prepared tomeet it.     We had therefore considered what action weeould take by publication of a warning to avert
aggression by Germany.     With this object in view, adeclaration had been drafted, which we sent to theFrench Government for their prompt consideration.     Itmight be necessary to take a rapid decision as to publication if fresh information came in.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat, if we accepted a commitment of the kind proposed,the Chiefs of Staff thought that our Staff conversations with the French should be extended to cover Poland.They thought, however, that such Conversations should becarried out by the French, who had considerable experienceof the Poles and had already had Conversations with them.This could probably be done later in a separate telegram.As regards the Draft Statement it was agreed thatthe second paragraph would require to be made much more general, and put on a broader foundation.On the suggestion of THE MINISTER OF LABOUR it wasagreed that the words &quot;and inasmuch as some further time may be occupied in the consultations now proceeding&quot; inthe third paragraph should be deleted.There was some discussion on the final paragraph,which, it was suggested, might put us too much in thehands of the Polish Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he came back to the point that the ultimate testwas action which the polish Government regarded as a threat to their independence.      THE PRIME minister agreed.     The real test was a threat to their independencewhich the Poles were prepared to resist.     reference was again made in this connection to the question of danzig.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that if the Poles
regarded the Danzig issue as constituting a threat totheir independence, and v/ere prepared to .resist by force,then we should have to come to their help.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS added,however, that it was clear that Colonel Beck was most anxious to avoid war with Germany if he could possibly   &apos;do so.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thedeclaration should end up on a somewhat less defiantnote, and should indicate the desirability of settlingdifferences not by threats of force but by discussion.He suggested that we might indicate our readiness totake part in such a discussion, if called upon to do so.Such action would be more in accord with our generalpolicy.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he agreed, generally, but was a little averse fromindicating our willingness to enter into discussions between Germany and Poland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that the last paragraph of the Statement met the main point which hehad made.     He thought it was clear, however, that astatement on the lines proposed could not be made unlessthe Polish Government so desired,THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE pointedout that the Draft Statement could not be issued until further information had been obtained.     If this happened, the statement might well be issued too late toserve any purpose.     He suggested that it might bebetter to issue a more general statement at an earlier date, which would give more timely warning.In the course of discussion general agreement was expressed with this view.      It was suggested that this might be done by a Parliamentary Question and answer on Friday.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that to he an effective deterrent the statement would have to he made publicly0In the course of further discussion theForeign Secretary said he attached some importanceto taking action which would make it plain to importantpeople in Government circles in Germany that herr hitler was embarking on action which was likely to leadto war on two frontse     It was, however, generally felt that the publication at this juncture of aStatement on the lines of the draft circulated tothe Meeting was likely to be provocative to the GermanGovernment0THE PRIME MINISTER then read out to the cabinet an alternative to the Draft Statement which he had prepared.Some discussion ensued as to whether the statement should take the line that we had a vital interest in theindependence of Polando     The view was expressed thatthis would not be the best line to take, particularly from the point of view of public opinion in the UnitedStates,It was suggested that the final words of thedraft Statement, circulated by the Foreign Secretary,should be incorporated in the Prime Minister&apos;s draft,viz; that in the event of action which clearlythreatened Polish independence, and which Poland felt obliged to resist, His Majesty*s Government would lendPoland all the support in their power.
Discussion then took place as to the procedure to he followed,,THE PRIME MINISTER explained that he had already seen the Opposition Leaders and explained the position to themand they had indicated their general concurrence in theline of action proposed.     He agreed v/ith the proposal that a Parliamentary statement should he made by meansof a Parliamentary Question and Answer, but he thoughtthat it would obviously be necessary to have priorconsultations with Warsaw and Paris.     It was agreed thatarrangements should be made for a Parliamentary Question,which would have to be a Private Notice Question, tobe answered on Friday morning, or if that v/as notpossible, on Friday afternoon.     In order to secure this, it would be necessary for telegrams to be despatchedat once to Warsaw and Paris, and the Foreign secretary was authorised to proceed accordingly.      It v/as suggested that these telegrams should indicate that aQuestion had been put down for reply on Fridayreferring to various rumours which were circulating asto a possible German coup against Poland.      It shouldbe indicated that we did not necessarily attach credenceto the rumour Sc.      If, however, they should, contraryto our opinion, have some substance in fact, and if any action   resulted which clearly threatened Polishindependence, and the Polish Government felt accordinglyobliged to resist, II.M. Government and the FrenchGovernment would give the Polish Government all thesupport in their power.     The telegram to poland should state that it was presumed that a statement on tli^se lines v/ould be in accord with the v/ishesof the Polish Government.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed out thatGolonel Beck was coming here on Monday, and this would affectthe situation in two ways.     In the first place, any state-ment would add great significance to Colonel Beck&apos;s visit,and secondly, he thought it would affect the possibility of getting a definite reply from Poland in the course of thenext two or three days.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE then read out a Memorandum which he had just received from the Chiefsof Staff, who had discussed the international situation withthe Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, War Office./]k copy of this Memorandum is on record in the Secretary&apos;standard file of Cabinet Conclusions,./     The effect of this information was to indicate that the present German military dispositions appeared to be intended to cover a coup d!etatagainst Danzig.Reference was made by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence and the Home Secretary to the importance of avoid-ing some action on Poland&apos;s part, which might result inprecipitating hostilities, without consultation with us.     Itwas pointed out that this would apply to any steps for fullmobilisation, although it was known that Poland had alreadymobilised considerable numbers of troops.Jtude of THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that heBomirrAons.had been rung up that morning by Mr. Lyons who had intimated that if we became involved in a war, Australia would be with us.     Mr. Lyons had also indicated that he thought we appearedto be taking on commitments in regard to certain rather weakcountries, and he seemed to have no very high opinion ofRussia.     He had indicated to Mr. Lyons that we might at anytime find ourselves faced with a threat of war and that, ifsuch a threat was made, the best plan was probably to meetit at once.0
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he had received indications which showed thatthe anti-German feeling in South Africa was increasingconsiderably.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that he had also had a message from Mr. mackenzie king who drew a distinction between a communicationsent to a Dominion Prime Minister for purposes of consultation, in which he was specifically asked forhis consent to a line of action, and .a communicationsent to him for his information, which merely gave himan opportunity of objecting if he so desired.      TheSecretary of State asked whether, in the present case,telegrams were to be sent in the form of consultation or information, and further whether such telegrams shouldbe sent now or later,THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the telegramssent should be informatory.      It was desirable to send a fully informative telegram that day.      The telegrammight set out the position in regard to the international situation and the steps which had already been taken for consultation between the various powers.      It might beadded that, in the meantime, information had beenreceived as to a possible coup over the week-end, andthat for this reason we had felt bound to consider what action we should take immediately in order to deterGermany if she was contemplating action at this time.The actual terms of the draft statement should not becommunicated that day, but would no doubt be sent later.
The Cabinet agreed -(l) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to despatch tele-grams forthwith to His Majesty&apos;ammbassadors at Warsaw and Paris on thelines indicated in the discussion.These telegrams should state that a parliamentary Question was being asked in the House of Commons onFriday, suggesting that a German attackon Poland was imminent and asking what action His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldtake in such a case.     It should be indicated that, subject to the concur-rence of the French Government, we proposed to reply that, while we mustnot be taken as accepting the rumourof a proposed attack as true, we had assured the Polish Government, that if,pending the conclusion of consultations with other Governments, any action wastaken which clearly threatened theindependence of Poland so that Polandfelt bound to resist with her national forces, His Majesty&apos;s Government would at once lend there all the support intheir power.     The telegram to poland should say that we presumed that this reply would be in accordance with thePolish Government&apos;s wishesj(2) To authorise the Foreign PolicyCommittee, at a Meeting to be held at3C45 p.m. that afternoon, to settle the terms of the statement to be madeon Friday in reply to the parliamentary question, subject, of course, to the answers received from Paris and Warsaw.(3)That telegrams should be despatchedthe same day to the Dominion Govern-rnents for their information, explaining the present position and the actionwhich was contemplated.     The terms ofthe draft statement should not becommunicated to the Dominions at thisstage.

THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEreferred to the Conclusion reached by the cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin, that theChiefs of Staff should have authority to impart tothe French such information as to our plans and resources (other than certain technical details)as was necessary to ensure co-ordination in peace and efficient co-operation In war.The Minister said that the matter hadbeen further reviewed by the Committee of ImperialDefence, who had been informed that the StrategicalAppreciation Sub-Comviittee had reached theconclusion that, on balance, we stood to gain   morethan we should lose by taking the French into our confidence in regard to such secret equipment asR.D.F, and asdics).     The Committee of ImperialDefence had concurred in this view, subject to no information being given in regard to processes ofmanufacture.     Any secret equipment which theFrench desired to adopt would have to be manufactured in this country.The Minister said that he had proposed tosubmit this matter to the Cabinet later, but asStaff Conversations were now proceeding rather more rapidly than had previously been anticipated, hewould be glad if the Cabinet would reach a decisionon this matter that morning.The Cabinet agreed.That our representatives in the staff conversations should have authorityto disclose to the French secretequipment, such as R.D.F. and asdics^subject to a stipulation that such ofour secret equipment as the French may desire to adopt should be manufactured in this country.Richmond Terrace, S.W.150th March, 1939,
DRAFT statement the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as of otherGovernments with.whom they have been in consultation, is notdirected against any legitimate aims or interests of the GermanGovernment, but is concerned solely with the prevention offurther attempts by that Government to destroy by force orthreat of force the independence of other states.Apart from other evidence at their disposal that is dis-quieting, His Majesty&apos;s Government have not failed to observe that the German Government have, during the last few days, begun to employ the same methods of violent press attack on Poland,that were used to prepare for the forcible absorption ofCze cho-Slovakia.This is inevitably causing anxiety, and inasmuch as some further time may be occuped in the consultations now proceeding,His Majesty&apos;s Government think it desirable forthwith to makeplain what is their position pending the conclusion of these consultations.His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly hope that their anxietiesmay be without foundation, and, as they have repeatedly stated,it is no part of their policy to interfere with the adjustmentthrough free negotiation between the parties concerned of any differences that may from time to time arise between them.At the same time in pursuance of the policy to which theirpresent consultations are directed I wish to say on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, that, in theevent.
2.event of resort by the German Government to any action whichthe Polish Government feels obliged to regard as a threat totheir independence and accordingly to resist, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will at once lend the Polish Government all support in their power.
Draft telegram to Sir E. Phipps (Paris).United States Ambassador here has informed us of message,sent by United States Ambassador in Warsaw, to the effectthat Hitler considers Ribbentrop deserves great credit forthe Memel coup and that, on the strength of this, Ribbentropis now pressing for immediate action against Poland, pointing out that Great Britain and France will fail to support poland and that this failure would have additional advantage thatit would serve to alienate American opinion from France andGreat Britain.We have some reason to apprehend that preparations fcr a coup against Poland are far advanced and that action may beimminent.It may take some days yet to conclude with Poland anarrangement such as we have in mind for the defence of poland and Roumania, and we feel it is highly desirable to give atimely warning to the German Government concerning anyaggression against Poland.     Even if this does not have sufficient deterrent effect to induce Hitler to hold his hand,we feel that it may produce division of opinion in German,particularly army, circles.We are therefore considering desirability of issuing,as soon as we obtain concurrence of French Government,declaration of which text is given in my immediately following telegram.Please at once consult French Government and let me knowwhether ...
whether they agree and. would issue similar declarationsimultaneously.     I would of course give them as long noticeas possible before publication of declaration, but it mightbe a matter of hours only.

Thecontinuance of the guarantee now given by His Majesty*sGovernment would be dependent on whether comprehensive scheme, as outlined in my telegram No.       , can be putinto operation.
Draft telegram to Sir R. Hoare (Bucharest).My telegram to Paris Ho.Please at once exolain to Roumanian Governmentthat His Majesty&apos;s Government are resolved to continue with the scheme explained in my telegram No.They have been led to take this interim actionregarding Poland alone in view of the information in their possession which seems to point to immediate action against that country.
1 oo103ANNEXReport by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee tothe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.MINISTER.The Chiefs of Staff have just discussed theinternational situation with D.D.M.I., War Office,and they think it right to inform you at once of theinformation they have received.dispositions opposite Poland to-day.    The significantfeature is the concentration of German troopsopposite Silesia (coal and iron districts).      In theNorth there are four to five divisions on either sideof the corridor.    This is practically normal.3. The D.D.M.I.  interprets the concentrationopposite Silesia3 not as an intention to invadePoland from the south west, but as forming an effective threat in any negotiations with Poland.There is in fact no evidence that either the Germansor the Italians intend to make any major move but theyare employing the same technique as they adopted whenthey started the Dutch hare running with suchsuccess in February by spreading rumours of Italianintentions in the Mediterranean.    D0D.M0I0 considersthat the present dispositions and smoke screen are designed to cover a coup d?etat against Danzig only.The attached map shows the German
4. The D.D.M.I. does not think the Germans have any intention of going beyond Danzig at present, or that the Poles in present circumstances will fightif Danzig is the only issue unless Germany presentsan ultimatum in regard to it.    They would, however inhis judgment, undoubtedly fight for the Corridor.5. If the Cabinet decide to make an announcementthe Chiefs of Staff think that the followingpoints should be safeguarded.    It should be made clear that we should not intervene -(a) unless there were a definite act of aggression against Polishterritoryi(b) unless the Poles resisted suchaggression and appealed to us tohelp i(c) unless Prance were fullycommitted with us.6. The Chiefs of Staff think it. important thatthe Poles should make a simultaneous declaration that they would come to the help of Prance orourselves if either of us were attacked.    otherwise there would be no two front war for Germany.7. The Ohiefs of Staff also think it important that we should, by some means, secure that Roumania&apos;resources are denied to Germany in the event ofwar.(Signed) C.L.N. NEWALL.
