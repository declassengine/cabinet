THE, CABINET: 1.    THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleaguesMeeting on       that the Meeting of the Cabinet on Wednesday, g2ndWednesday.22nd March.      March, would take place at 10 a.m. , on account ofthe Luncheon to &quot;be given at the Guildhall to thePresident of the French Republic.    As cars had tohe en route by 12 o&apos;clock, it would be necessaryfor members of the Cabinet attending the Luncheonto come to the Cabinet in uniform.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: 2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNSituation. AFFAIRS said that there was not much which he(Previous could tell his colleagues beyond the text of an reference:Cabinet 3 agreement signed early that morning by Herr Hitler(39), Con-clusion 7. )       and Herr von Ribbentrop, on behalf of Germany,Ffl. /? 34)*&apos;      and by Dr. Hacha and Dr0 Chvalkowsky, on behalfof Czechoslovakia,    The text of this agreement had already appeared in the 7.0 aam.  edition ofthe &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;0The Foreign Secretary then read out theagreement,  the text of which is contained in telegram No0  103 from Berlin.The Foreign Secretary added that at  .30 a*mo  German troops had appeared in the outskirts of Prague-,    Early that morning Reuters1Berlin Correspondent had informed Reuters, on information received from an official of theMinistry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin, thatBohemia and Moravia were to be militarily occupied.According to Reuters&apos;  Correspondent, the Ministryof Foreign Affairs had admitted officially thatthe occupation had begun on the previous day. Greatreticence was being maintained, at the Ministryof Foreign Affairs in Berlin, about Hungary1sattitude.    Routers&apos; Buda-Pest Correspondentreported that Hungarian troops were discreetlyinfiltrating into Ruthenia.    A Proclamation was expected that day annexing Ruthenia to Hungary.Reuters&apos;  Correspondent at Bucharestreported that Dr. Volosin, the ex-Ruthenian PrimeMinister, had been wounded and that he and theother members of his Cabinet had fled to Roumania.Reuters also confirmed the occupation of thirtyvillages by Roumaniao
Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that hehad seen the French Ambassador the previous day.    TheFrench Government took much the same view of the matter as we did, and held that there was no possibility ofeffectively opposing what was taking place, or of influencing the position,,    The French Government had said that they would take no action except in consultationwith us.In a telegram dated 14th March (No. 104 from paris) Sir Eric Phipps had said that he had seenM. Bonnet and M0 Beranger, who both felt that theless we interfered in this crisis the better.    Theyhad both remarked that this renewed rift between the czechs and the Slovaks showed that we nearly went towar last autumn on behalf of a State which was not&quot;viable&quot;.In reply to the Prime Minister, the foreign secretary said that Germany had not, so far as was known, objected to the occupation of Ruthenia byHungary.    This might be because Germany did not wishto raise objections to Poland and Hungary obtaining the common frontier which they desired.    Again, it mightbe that Germany thought that this common frontierwould not constitute an effectual barrier to any actionwhich she might wish to take at a later date.Frontier THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed outGuarantee.that although Germany&apos;s action did not in terms constitute an unprovoked aggression, the same could not be saidof Hungary&apos;s action0THE PRIME MINISTER said that he&quot; thought thefundamental fact was that the State whose frontierswe had undertaken to guarantee against unprovoked aggression had now completely broken up,
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that we could also rely on the argument thatwe had regarded the terms of our guarantee as morallybinding before the guarantee had technically come intoforce, because we intended our action to be a means ofsteadying the position during what was thought to bea purely transitory situation    We had, however, neverintended permanently to assume responsibility for a monopoly of obligation in this matter.,THE PRIMES MINISTER thought that if it was agreedthat the argument which he had suggested was valid,  itwould perhaps be undesirable to supplement it with the argument put forward by the Foreign Secretary.    He also thought that it would be wise to take an early opportunityof saying that,  in the circumstances which had arisen,our guarantee had come to an end.The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues ofthe history of this guarantee.    In the first instanceit had been part of an arrangement   made with theFrench, in response to a request put forward by theFrench Government,    As we had been asking Czechoslovakiato make considerable sacrifices, we had felt under an obligation to offer a guarantee.    At that time it had beenbelieved that both Germany and Italy would join in theguarantee.The Prime Minister explained that in the courseof the Munich discussions the question of a guarantee for Czechoslovakia had been mentioned.    The matter hadnot, however, been raised formally, as there had been noset discussion with all the parties sitting round a table.We had,however, enquired whether Germany and Italy were prepared to
enter into a guarantee, and they had replied that theywere not willing to do so until Czechoslovakia hadsettled her minority questions with Poland and Hungary.This had led to discussion as to the position of ourguarantee. M. Daladier had said that the FrenchGovernment guarantee was already in operation, and he(the Prime Minister) had felt that we were bound tokeep closely in step in this matter with the French.It was in these circumstances that the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, as spokesman of the Government,had made a statement on this subject in the House ofCommons on the 4th October.In reply to a question as to the attitude adopted by the Czechoslovak Government towards theguarantee, the Prime Minister said that the czechoslovak government had stated sometime back that they were notprepared to give us their views as to what form theguarantee should take, until they knew what view Germanyheld on the matter*It might,, no doubt, be true that the disruptionof Czechoslovakia had been largely engineered byGermany, but our guarantee was not a guarantee againstthe exercise of moral pressure.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Germanaction had all been t^ken under the guise of agreementwith the Czechoslovak Government.     The Germans were,therefore, in a position to give a plausible answer toany representations which were made.     They would no
doubt say that a situation had arisen in which Germancitizens were being insulted and maltreated;    that representatives of the Czechoslovak Government had visited the German Government and had then invited&apos;the Germans to assist in keeping order.In reply to a question whether the representativesof the Czechoslovak Government had gone to Berlin atthe invitation of the German Government, the foreign secretary pointed out that the oommiinlqiie published that morning from Berlin said that the Czech representa-tives had &quot;been received in Berlin at their own request.THE SECRETARY OF ST,;&apos;.TE FOR WAR pointed out thathitherto Herr Hitler had contented himself withincorporating        German peoples into the Reich andthat that had constituted the first phase.     Thepresent step resulted in the establishment   of Germandominance over non-German peoples,  and constituted thebeginning of a new and second phase and all pointed to the Drang nach Osten.     The former Military Attacheto Berlin had foretold these two phases and thoughtthat there would be a third phase, namely, when germany would begin to expel the Slavs from the territories which she dominated.The Secretary of State for War thought that itwas now in our interests that Hungary should incorporateRuthenia, and that we should enco^lrage as close arelationship as possible with Turkey, Roumania and,if possible, with Hungary,     It was pointed out inthis connection that Slovakia was not strong enough   to constitute an independent state.
THE PRIMS MINISTER said that there were three connected points on which it would benecessary to reach a decision that morning, namely -(l) The proposed visit of thePresident of the Board of Trade to berlin.(2) He would be asked to make a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon and it would be necessary, after setting out the facts, to give some indication of our attitude to these events.(3) The proposed loan to Czechoslovakia.Visit of the The Prime Minister thought that it wasPresident of theBoard of Trade   impossible for the President of the Board ofto Berlin.Trade to visit Berlin at the present time0THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that, apart from the trade aspects ofthe negotiations, he thought that a visit by thePresident to Berlin would be highly undesirableat the present time.     He thought the same would apply to the proposed visit to Berlin of theSecretary of the Department of Overseas Trade.It was necessary that we should take some overtaction to show our disapproval of Germany&apos;s action.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE saidthat, if the matter was looked at from the tradepoint of view, the result of postponement of the visitmight be serious, since the German Governmentsreaction was, he thought, likely to be to break offthe existing trade talks.     Unless we could find some means of reaching agreement with Germany, weshould be strongly pressed to stand by our industries in order to enable them to compete with Germany.At the same time, he thought that politically itwas undesirable for him to visit Germany.     Hethought that the same applied to Mr. Hudson.
Some discussion ensued as to whetherit would be possible for the visit of the Presidentof the Board of Trade to be postponed but for mr. Hudson to go to Berlin.The Cabinet, however, reached theconclusion that this would be an unsatisfactorysolution and that Mr. Hudsonrs visit to Berlin aswell as that of the President of the Board of trade should be postponed.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that,in this matter, it was necessary to steer a coursebetween, on the one hand, pious and futilelectures and, on the other hand, the undesirabilityof leaving public opinion in any doubt as to our attitude to Germany&apos;s action in this matter.In further discussion, it was agreedthat the fact that Mr. Hudson&apos;s visit to Berlinwould be postponed was no reason why he should not carry out his proposed tour to other countriesin the Baltic and Eastern Europe.      It would greatly diminish the strength of our disapproval ofGermany&apos;s action, which the postponement of the visit to Berlin was intended to imply if the rest of the visit was also postponed.     It was pointed out thatthe visits of the British Ministers to Berlin hadbeen arranged in connection with negotiations inprogress by the Federation of British Industrieswith corresponding organisations in Germany,but that this did not apply to the other visits.
Recall of H.M.Ambassadorfrom Berlin.THE PRESIDENT OP.THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat he thought that the fact that his visit was postponed would he in itself a sufficient mark of:disapproval, and that it would he undesirable tomake any statements which would render it difficultto resume the economic discussions at a later date.It was also agreed that the German Government shouldhe informed of the proposed postponement of the visit before any public announcement of the fact wasmade.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS   &apos;asked his colleagues to consider the possibilityof recalling His Majesty1s Ambassador from Berlin.On the whole he was against this step since,although it was easy to recall an Ambassador, itwas not so easy to find reasons to justify his return.     The United States were experiencing this difficulty.     The same argument, however, did notapply if we recalled our Ambassador to report, inwhich case he could return to Berlin after a week or so.     While he did not feel strongly on the .matter, he thought that there was something to besaid for adopting this course.     He was reluctant to allow public opinion in the United States or inSouth-eastern Europe to think that we were inert.The general view of the Cabinet was thatthe step suggested was premature.     The postponement of the visit of the British Ministers to Berlinwould be a signal mark of our disapproval.
Furtherf  it must he home in mind that the action-of which we disapproved had only heen reported in&apos; the last few hour s *    In this connection it waspointed out that the situation had been completely-changed since the previous day owing to the news of Germany&apos;s military incursions into Czechoslo-vakia0The Cabinet agreed that HisMajesty!s Ambassador should not now be recalled from Berlin^but that the question ofrecalling him should be reservedfor further consideration ata later dateDStatement to be At the outset of the discussion attentionmade in theHouse of Commons^ was devoted to the statement to be made by thePrime Minister in answer to a Private notice question,        Later, however, information wasreceived to the effect that the Opposition were asking for a debate to take place that afternoon in place of the discussion on Navy Estimates, a demandwhich it was felt must be agreed to.     Inaddition to the proposed statement, the PrimeMinister would, therefore, have to make a speech on the matter,,THE PRIME MINISTER read out a short state-ment which he had drafted indicating the general line of the statement which he proposed to make*The statement started by expressing His majesty&apos;s government*s regret at the military occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia and ended with an announce-ment to the effect that, in the circumstances, the visit of the British Ministers to Berlin would notbe appropriate.     The Prime Minister invited hiscolleagues to give him their general reactions asto the line of the statement to be made*
In the course of the discussion the wisdom ofemphasising the military occupation of Czechoslovakiawas questioned on the ground that the czechoslovak government had invited this step0THE PRIME MINISTER explained that he thoughtthat Iierr Hitler was disappointed in not being ableto stage a military triumph in the Auturniio He had for some time past been working for a militarydemonstration,, He, therefore., thought that themilitary occupation was symbolic,&apos; more than perhapsappeared on the surface0THE SECRETARY CP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought it was significant that this was the first occasion   on     which     Germany had applied her shocktactics to the domination of non-Germans,     He thought that itwas important to find language which would imply thatGermany was now being led on to a dangerous path*This was of importance from the point of view of ourGerman broadcasts which were having increasing influence.He also stressed that Germany11 s attitude in this matter was completely inconsistent with the Munich agreement.Germany had deliberately preferred naked force tothe methods of consultation and discussionoTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thestatement should make it clear that the Government nolonger had any obligation, legal or moral, under theguarantee to Czechoslovakia^     He thought, and the PRIMEMINISTER agreed, that this should be made clear at the outset.     It would be desirable if possible to say thatthe French agreed with our view, but the FOREIGN secretary thought that although this was in fact the case, it was doubtful whether we were in the position to make astatement to that effect that afternoon,
I 16It was agreed that the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary should he authorised to settle the terms of thestatement to he made by the PrimeMinister in the House of Commons that afternoon, in the light of the discussion which had taken place.Financial THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reminded., his assistance, colleagues that the total amount involved was  10millions.     He had made enquiries that morning andhad ascertained that  3 millions had been drawn fromZJftq)&apos;0- the Bank of England and that  7 millions remained tobe drawn.     He had sent a message to the Bank ofEngland to say that if any further drafts fromPrague were presented, Irinuoy chtwli. aat Tm auuiu^^enilym&amp;mf&amp;B further authority from the Government.     Theposition was not perhaps altogether unfavourable,inasmuch as the  3 millions which had &quot;been djpawn hadbeen very largely used for the purposes which wehad had in mindo     For example,  g- million had been used to enable people to go to Palestine, whileother sums had been given to other refugees toenable them to leave the country.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that no reference should be made in the proposed statement to theloan, but that he should deal with the matter inhis speech by explaining how matters stood atpresent.     With regard to the future, he would say that it had been decided to suspend further payments until.we saw how the position developed^
The Cabinet agreed:-(l)    That the forthcoming visit of thePresident&quot; of the Board of Trade andthe Secretary of the Department of overseas Trade to Berlin should be postponed:(2)    That the visit of the Secretary ofthe Department of Overseas Trade to moscow and certain other capitalsshould be carried out s(3)    That H0M. Ambassador should not nowbe recalled from B&amp;rlin, but thatthe question of recalling him shouldbe reserved for further consideration at a later date:(4)    That the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should be authorised to settle theterms of the statement to be made bythe Prime Minister in the House ofCommons that afternoon, in the lightof the discussion which had taken place:(5)    To authorise the Prime Minister to include in his speech in the House of Commons that afternoon a statement that  3 millions ofthe proposed financial assistance to czechoslovakia has already been paid butthat any further payment, over and abovethe  3 millions would be suspended forthe presento
ITALY.(previous reference;;Cabinet 9 (39)Conclusion 2. )It3.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said hethought it was important to obtain all the information available as to the attitude of Italy.. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Earl of Perth had arranged for his military, Naval and Air Attaches to make exhaustivetours in Italy to investigate the position.      Theyhad horne across nothing significant.      Indeed theaircraft factories seemed to be working at a somewhatlower output, and reserves were reported to be at a low level.The Cabinet took note of the above.
SPAIN;Blockade ofRepubli canterritory.(previous reference cabinet,?(39), Con-clusion 6).4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that General Franco had issued ahorder the preceding week which amounted toclosing a certain area and saying that hewould sink any ships which entered ports inthat area.    He (the Foreign Secretary) had madea statement in the House of Lords in which hehad raised no questions of principle.     Pie had said that we would continue to give protection to our ships on the high seas, and would retaliatein regard to any indefensible action insideterritorial waters.     He had, however, left vaguethe action which we would take in the event ofseizure of British ships by General Franco insideSpanish territorial waters.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary saidthat if it was proposed to expand the statement which he had made in the House of Lords, this could only be done by saying that General Francohad a right to close the ports.       This was equivalent to giving him the right to seize and attack ships.     If, however, we took no further action, the present position would be that our ships would have a right to try to enter the ports in Republican Spain, and General Franco wouldhave the right to try to stop ships insideterritorial waters, provided that he stoppedthem in a recognised way.       If General Francowere to seize ships in territorial waters, thenno doubt an argument v/ould ensue, and we shouldclaim that the ships should be released andthat compensation should be paid and so forth.
The question arose whether we should go further and allow General Franco to exercise&quot;belligerent rights in Spanish territorial waters.He understood that the President of the Board ofTrade would prefer to leave matters as they were.He had seen the Duke of Alba the previous day and had told him that we did not wish to havetrouble over this mattero     He hoped, therefore,that the Duke of Alba would dissuade general franco&apos;s Government from doing outrageous thingsas, for example, sinking ships in territorial waters.In the course of discussion, thefollowing points emerged:-THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he was afraid the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement might encourage British merchant ships to attempt to run the blockade on the ground that the Government would support them.      If British ships tried to run theblockade and were sunk, he thought that a difficult situation might arise.     He also pointed out that inso far as General Franco had threatened to sink ships at sight, his statement was entirely unjustified.He thought, however, that a sovereign state was entitled to close ports in an area where there wasinsurgency.     This problem had frequently arisen allover the world, and he was unable to give    anyparallel case in which the right to close ports wasnot claimed.     He agreed, however, that it would be quite reasonable to act on the line&apos; that the stoppage of ships: must be limited to territorial waters.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OFDEFENCE pointed out that earlier in the war, when
the former Spanish Government had been in control of thesea, we had refused to recognise any right to seize our ships on the high seas.   &quot;We had, however, taken the viewthat territorial waters cannot be separated from theState territory, and the actions of our Fleet, when ships had been running Franco&apos;s blockade and trying to enterBilbao and Santander, had been based on this principle. very careful instructions had been drawn up and communicatedto the Fleet on this matter, and General Franco was well aware of them.   He thought that there were only twocourses open to us.   First to accept the blockade5 whichwould be inconsistent with our previous attitude.Second, to refuse to accept the blockade and say that ourposition in this matter was exactly the same as that adopted when General Franco was attempting to blockadeBilbao and Santander.   The adoption of this second coursewould,he thought, be wholly consistent, and moreover   wouldbe readily understood by General Franco.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that his department had always been careful to avoid giving any instructions to shipowners.   Shipowners, however, were well aware of the fact that their ships would not receive anyprotection within territorial waters, but that they werenot liable to be sunk within territorial waters without warning.    In response to a request from the foreign secretary, he undertook to try to stop ships from attempting to run General Franco&apos;s blockade, but he did not thinkthat the type of firm which was now engaged in this business would be likely to prove very amenable to argument, moreespecially since the present blockade was not very effective
and the profits were &quot;believed to be considerable.The Cabinet agreed:-(l)   That we should adhere to our presentposition in the matter, namely that weshould not admit any right on GeneralFranco1s part to seize our ships on thehigh seas, or any right on General Francoispart to sink ships without warning withinterritorial waters.(2)   That such steps as were possible shouldbe taken to avoid any serious troublearising out of the Blockade of RepublicanSpain.
PALESTINE.The LondonConferences.I; (previous Reference:I Cabinet 10(39), Con-clusion 5).Attitude ofpfche Jews.5. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE colonies said that the substance of the final proposals to- ........be communicated orally to the Arab and JewishDelegations had been considered by the PalestineCommitteeo      Copies of a revise of these finalproposals were handed round at the meeting of theCabinet.On the constitutional issue the Jews were fairly satisfied, since our proposals left open thepossibility of an independent Palestine State onfederal linese     What the Jews hoped for was thatthey would obtain complete control of immigration into the Jewish areas of the federal State.The Jews objected strongly, however, to our proposals for the transitional periods     In particular they objected to the suggestion that Arabs and Jewsshould be nominated to the^Advisory councils in theproportion of two to one     The Jews wanted paritywith the Arabs, and feared that the two to oneproportion would prejudice their position in theindependent Palestine State in its final form.     Ithad, of course, been explained to them that while theArabs would out-number the Jews on the^AdvisoryCouncil, the Arabs would not out-number the Jewstogether with the British members.It seemed very likely that the Jews would refuseface (uUutf a*^tto accept nomination to the/Advisory Council at anyrate in the early stages^      It might be, however, thatafter a few months, when the present bitterness haddied down, they would be prepared to accept nomina-tion.     Generally speaking, the Jewish reception ofthe constitutional proposals was somewhat mixed.\      .....&quot;&quot;,7 - &apos; &quot; &apos;- 19 -
The Jewish attitude to the immigration proposals was one of hitter opposition.     The point to which they took particular exception was, of course, theprovision that there should he no continued immigra-tion after a period of five years without the acqui-escence of all parties.     It was perhaps unnecessary to repeat all the arguments which they used on thispoint.     It would suffice to say that they wouldprobably break on this issue.The Jews also objected strongly to our proposals in regard to land transfers,Generally, it seemed that the Jewish representa-tives as a whole, including such representatives as lord Reading and Lord Bearsted? would reject theproposals entirely.     Dr. Weizmann was in a very bittermood, thought our proposals a betrayal of the Jews,and said that they would result in worse bloodshedin Palestine than ever before^     The responsibilityfor this, he said, would rest on our shoulders.There was no doubt that our proposals were a bitterdisappointment to the Jews as a whole, but it wasonly fair to point out that if the Jews had devotedsome of their energies in the last twenty years totrying to establish good relations with the Arabs,the present position would never have arisen.The Palestinian Arabs were also likely to reject the Governments proposals.     On the constitutionalside they appreciated that the Governments proposals would not give them complete power to do what they wished in Palestine,     They were also critical of our proposals for the transitional period.     They were-yy-y &quot;v-: ;y::: y-&apos;     - .V    &apos; \      yy&amp; : - yyy.-;:satisfied with the proportion of Arab to Jewish repre-.   ......;y;y.y &quot; - - .    .-y;V\ -.. -:-- &quot;&apos; *  ,    &apos; . .   . i\ .  v-,.....- /.. -\ ;&quot;:&apos;;w:.;:-:;&apos;- ;.; f-;; -.&apos; , \v........  .    -   &apos;sentatives, hut they realised that the british representatives would exercise a preponderating power.- 20 -Kttitude of thegalestiuian-Arabs.
There was a possibility that the Arabs also^ouldrefuse to nominate representatives to the AdvisoryCouncil^,    If this happened, presumably things would continue much as at present on the constitutionalside.As regards immigration, the Arabs were, of coursepleased that they would have the power to veto furtherimmigration after five years, but they thoughtthat the figure of 75,000 immigrants in the next fiveyears was much too big.     They were thinking in termsof some 20,000 immigrants in this period.As regards the land proposals, the Arabswere fairly satisfied.The representatives of the Palestinian Arabsrecognised that our&quot;proposals represented a greatadvance in recognition of the rights and position of arabs in Palestine.     Further, these proposalsremoved two fears which had dominated their minds,namely, first, the creation of a Jewish State inPalestine, and, second, that Jewish immigration would continue until the Jews had established a majority inPalestine.     Nevertheless, it seemed likely that the palestinian Arabs, at a Meeting to be held that afternoon, would make a number of critisisms of our proposals, and in the end would probably reject them.Attitude of If this happened, the attitude of the represen-Arab States.tatives of the neighbouring Arab States became a matterof great importance.     Their own judgment was probably in favour of acceptance of these terms, and they realised that on merits the terms had much to commendthem.    But they were very loth to come to any sort of
agreement with us unless the Palestinian Arabs wouldalso reach an agreement on the same terms.Two suggestions had been put to the representa-tives of the neighbouring Arab States:    one was thatall the neighbouring Arab States should enter into anagreement with us on the basis of our proposals.It had &quot;been represented to them that if they alltook this course they would be unlikely to be subjected to criticism by public opinion in their own countries.     Further, if they entered into anagreement with us in this matter, the proposals wouldbe far more binding on us than if we were to make a unilateral declaration of policy which was not accepted by any Of the parties represented at the conferences.The second proposal put to them was that, ifthey were not prepared to enter into an agreement withregard to these proposals, we would make a unilateral declaration of policy, and they should issue a statement to the effect that while the Palestinian Arabs had notgained all that they had asked for, they had obtained a great deal; and they would therefore appeal to the palestinian Arabs to stop their campaign of violence.There was a possibility that the second coursewould be adopted.Continuing, the Colonial Secretary said that theposition would be a good deal clearer in two or three days time.     The form of the White Paper which was tobe presented to Parliament would depend on the events of these next few days.     The White Paper would ofcourse contain a great deal more than the final
proposals which he had circulated to his colleagues.A good deal would be said as to the history of thematter and the arguments in support of our proposals.A draft of the white Paper dealing with these matters had been prepared so far as was possible at thisstage.In the meantime the Government were in aposition of some difficulty since our proposals must now be communicated to the Delegates and it was clear that once this was done they would become knownto the Press.     As soon as this happened there wouldprobably be pressure in Parliament for a statement and it might therefore be necessary for the white paper to be laid before the discussions with theArab and Jewish Delegates had been finally concluded.A draft of the White. Paper would, of course, besubmitted to the Cabinet Committee on Palestine for examination and approval.The situation in the United States of Americawas being watched.     A telegram had been sent to our ambassador at Washington the previous night explainingour proposals.     This would be follotved by a fullertelegram in a few days time.The Colonial Secretary concluded by saying thathe was afraid that the Government would have a difficulttime when the proposals became knovm. but he had nodoubts as to their being just, fair and right and hewas sure that they could be justified to Parliament andto the League of Nations.
THE PRIME MINISTER proposed a modificationof the last sentence of paragraph A (l) to read as follows:-&quot;In such treaty relations withGreat Britain as would providesatisfactorily for the commercial and strategic interests of both countries o11This was agreed to.In reply to the Secretary of State for War,he said that the General Staff wished the strategic reservations to be more preciselystated.The Prime Minister said that this point would not arise until the stage of drafting aTreaty was reached.The Cabinet took note of thestatement by the Secreteiry ofState for the Colonies and approved the substance of thefinal proposals to be communicatedorally to the Arab and JewishDelegations subject to theamendment of paragraph A(l) as suggested by the Prime Minister-(A copy of the final proposals,  including theamendment of paragraph A (l) and certain other minor drafting amendments, is attached as an annex.)
THE CLUBST?FiGISTRATIONBILL,(previous reference:Cabinet 9(39), Con-clusion 8).6. The Cabinet again had before tp.em-^MgmDve&amp;rfxua^y&apos;the Home Secretary (CP. 51 (39)) drawing attention tothe Clubs Registration Bill,, introduced in the House ofCommons by a Private Member and down for Second reading on the 17th March.    In his Memorandum the Home Secretarystated that, in his present view, the Bill should be supported, and that facilities should be given for ensuring that it passed into law with such amendments as might be found necessary in Committee.    The onlyprovision to which the Government need object was theproposal in Clause       that in the event of objection tothe registration of a Club  the question should bereferred for decision to the County Court Judge.    TheHome Office view was that the appropriate authority wouldbe the Stipendiary Magistrate, or the Justices for the petty Sessional Division concerned, as the case mightbe.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Home Secretary(who was indisposed and unable to attend the Cabinetthat morning) had given further consideration to thematter, and had reached the conclusion that while theGovernment were bound, in view of their pledges tointroduce legislation on this subject to adopt a friendlyattitude towards the Clubs Registration Bill, it wouldprobably be a good thing if the Bill were defeated.The Home Secretary proposed to indicate that thiswas a matter in which details were all important;    thatthe Bill required extensive amendment which might occupyconsiderable time in Committee;    hut that no facilities could be promised for its later stages.    He should thenleave the matter to the Vote of the House.
The Home Secretary proposed^ howeverp to votehimself for the Second Reading of the Bill.In the course of a short discussion it waspointed out that there was considerable opposition tothis Bill not only from the bogus clubs which the bill was designed to deal with,, but also from the betterclass clubs and it was felt that the Bill might involve the Government in some political difficulty.The Cabinet agreed -To leave the Government attitude in regard to the Bill to besettled by the Prime minister in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Chief Whip.
THE LOCALGOVERNMENTAMENDMENT(SCOTLAND)BILL.(previous reference;Cabinet 9(39), Con-Clusion 6.)7. The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland(H.A.1S (39)) covering the draft Local GovernmentAmendment (Scotland) Bill, which had been prepared on lines recommended by the Scottish Local GovernmentConsolidation Committee, and was drafted to amend,in certain respects, the law relating to the disqualification of Councillors for membership ofCounty, Town and District Councils in Scotland;together with the following recommendation tothe Cabinet thereon by the Committee of Home Affairs:-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith .in the House of Commons of the LocalGovernment Amendments (Scotland) Billin the form of the draft annexed with.A.12(39), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that maybe found necessary or desirable.&quot;After a short discussion theCabinet agreed to this course.
ARMY ANDAIR FORGETJOURTS-martial committee,1938.Publicationof Reportof.8.     The Cabinet had under.. -con.s-id.er&amp;.tioia. &amp; tTo-intMemorandum by the Secretary of State for War and theSecretary of State for Air (CP. 66 (39)), in.whichthey sought authority for the immediate publicationof the Report of the Army and Air Force Courts-martial committee, 1938, as a White Paper, in advance of any decision as to the action to be taken on therecommendations contained therein.     The committee considered in particular whether there ought not to bea right of appeal against Court-Martial convictionsfor civil offences.     The main recommendations in theReport related to the appointment, constitution and functions of the Judge Advocate General, in connectionwith which the First Lord of the Admiralty had seriousmisgivings.     The differences between the three ministers had now been referred to the Lord Chancellor and theSecretary of State for the Dominions.     Meanwhile, itwas very desirable that the Report should be in thehands of Members of Parliament by the date of theCommittee Stage of the Avmy and Air Force (Annual) bill at the end of the month.In discussion the view was expressed that itwould be much more satisfactory to defer publication ofthe Report, if possible, until the Government had reached decisions as to the action to be taken in regardto it.THE LORD CHANCELLOR stated that he and theSecretary of State for the Dominions hoped to dispose of the points referred to them in the course of a fewdays.     It appeared, therefore, that it should bepossible to reach decisions as to  the action to be taken on the Report before the end of the month.
In these circumstances, the. cabinet agreed:(l) To defer for a week a decision as tothe publication of the Report of theCourts-Martial Committee:(2)   Subject to (1) above, to authorise theSecretary of State for War to makeprovisional preparations with a viewto the publication of the Report beforethe end of the month.

ANGLO-INDIANTRADE TREATY.previous reference jCabinet 36 (38)Conclusion 4)10.      THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat, after two years of negotiation, the Anglo-Indian Trade Treaty would probably be signed next week.     Looked at. purely from the trade point of view,the Treaty was unfavourable to us;    as his colleagues were aware, however, the negotiations had been carriedout on lines decided by the Cabinet from the widerpolitical point of view.     He was afraid that theTreaty would not be popular.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said thatthe Indian Legislature would be involved inconsiderable difficulties if the Treaty was signednext week.     He asked if it was possible to sign theTreaty during the current week.     In view, however, ofthe importance of ensuring adequate preparation inthe Press and elsewhere before the Treaty was published,it was   felt   that the present arrangements for the signature of the Treaty should stand.The Cabinet took note of the statement by the President of the Board of Trade ,and agreed that the present arrangementsfor the signature of the Treaty should stand.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.15th March, 1939.
E C R E TSTATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES ONTHE SUBSTANCE OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;S PROPOSALS.A.    CONSTITUTION.(1)    His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s ultimate objective isthe establishment of an independent Palestine State, possiblyof a federal nature, in such treaty relations with GreatBritain as would provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic interests of both countries.    This wouldinvolve the termination of the Mandate.(S)      It is not the objective of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that Palestine should become a Jewish State or an arab State;    nor do they regard their pledges to either Jewsor Arabs as requiring them to promote either of these alternatives.    It should be a State in which Arabs and Jewsshare in government in such a way as to ensure that theessential interests of each are safeguarded.(3) The constitution of the independent State would be drafted in due course by a National Assembly of the people ofPalestines either elected or nominated as may be agreed. HisMajesty&apos;s Government to be represented on the Assembly and tobe satisfied as to the provisions of the constitution, and inparticular as regards -(a) the security of and access to the Holy Places;(b) the protection of the different communities inPalestine in accordance with the obligations of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to both Arabs and Jews, and asregards securing the special position in Palestine ofthe Jev/ish National Home.
His Majesty?s Government would, also require to besatisfied that the interests of certain foreign countries inPalestine, for the preservation of which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are at present responsible, were.adequatelysafeguarded^(4)      The establishment of the   independent State to be preceded by a transitional period throughout which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as the Mandatory Power, would retain responsibilityfor the government of the country,(5)     As soon as peace and order are sufficiently restored,first steps to be taken towards giving the people of Palestine,during the transitional period, an increasing part in thegovernment of the country.The first stage of this process would be as follows-In the legislative sphere - The addition of a certainnumber of Palestinians, by nomination, to the AdvisoryCouncil;    the numbers of Arab and Jewish representativesbeing fixed approximately in proportion to theirrespective populations, and so as to give a majorityof Palestinian members.In the executive sphere - The selection of Palestinianmembers of the Advisory Council to sit on the ExecutiveCouncil;    the numbers of Arab and Jewish representativesbeing fixed approximately in proportion to theirrespective populations, and so that half the membersof the Council would be Palestinians,,The next stage would be -In the legislative sphere - The conversion of theAdvisory Council into a Legislative Council with an elected Palestinian element.,    Certain powers would be reserved to the High Commissioner.
In the executive sphere -Certain Departments wouldbe placed in charge of Palestinian members of theExecutive Council.After these second stages, further advances towards self-government in the transitional period might be inthe direction of increasing the powers of the LegislativeCouncil and also of placing more Departments under thecharge of. Palestinian members of the Executive Council.(6)      His; Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared, if conditions in Palestine permit, to hold elections for a legislative Council (the composition and powers of which wouldbe a matter for consultation between the different parties)within two years.    Beyond this no time limit can be fixed now for the advance from stage to stage of constitutional development in the transitional period;    nor can a date be fixed for theend of the transitional period and the establishment of theindependent State.    His Majesty&apos;s Government would hope thatthe whole process could be completed in ten years, but this must depend upon the situation in Palestine and upon the successof the various constitutional changes during the transitional period, and the likelihood of effective co-operation ingovernment by the people of Palestine.    They could not contemplate relinquishing all responsibility for the governmentof Palestine unless they were assured that the measure ofagreement between the communities in Palestine was such as tomake good government possible.B.      IMMIGRATION.(1)     Immigration during the next five years would be at separately which, if economic absorptive capacity permits,. would bring the Jewish population up to approximately one-third of
of the population.    Taking into account the expected natural increase of the Arab and Jewish populations, and the number ofillegal Jewish immigrants (estimated at 40,000) now in thecountry, this would entail the admission of some 75,000immigrants over the next five years, who would be admitted asfollows -First, 10., 000 per year;    then, in addition,25,000 Jewish refugees,  (special consideration being given to refugee children and dependants).    the refugees would be admitted as soon as the HighCommissioner is satisfied that adequate provision is secured for them.(2)      The existing machinery for ascertaining economicabsorptive capacity would be retained, and the High commissioner would have the ultimate responsibility for deciding what theeconomic capacity allowed.    Before a decision was reached,appropriate Jewish and Arab representatives would be consulted.(3)      After the period of five years Jewish immigrationwould only be permitted subject to the acquiescence of theArabs as well as of the Jews and the British authorities.    Thisquestion to be discussed and settled through the medium of theappropriate constitutional organs functioning during the transitional period, or by means of consultation between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and representatives of the Arabs and theJews.(4)      His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined to checkillegal immigration, and further preventive measures are being adopted and will be strictly enforced. The numbers of any Jewishillegal immigrants who, despite these measures, succeed Incoming into the country and cannot be deported would be deducted from the yearly quotas.
St. James&apos;s Palace,S.W.1.C.      LAND.The High Commissioner would he given general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers of land.    TheHigh Commissioner would be instructed to fix areas in whichtransfer was to be permitted freely, regulated or prohibited,in the light of the findings of the Peel and Woodhead Reports.He would retain this power throughout the transitional period.
