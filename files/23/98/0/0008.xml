THB CABINET:   &apos;Arrangements forEaster Recess.The Budget.1*      TIIB PRIME MINISTER said that, unless forany reason it was necessary to summon a Meeting atan earlier date, the next weekly Meeting of theCabinet would be held on Wednesday, 19th April.He asked his colleagues to arrange for theirSecretaries to communicate to the Cabinet Officesparticulars of their addresses and movementsthroughout the Easter Recess.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he proposed to make his Budget statement in the Houseof Commons on Tuesday,  the 25th April.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the customaryspecial meeting of the Cabinet to consider theChancellor&apos;s Budget proposals would be held shortly before that date.
i ITALY:Relations with france.(previous reference:Cabinet,     8 (39)  2.)j AlbaniaJ2. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FORE I GIT affairs read to his colleagues telegram ITOo 265 from Rome,received from the Earl of Perth the previous night,in regard to the possibility of starting negotiations between France and Italy. This telegram had been repeated to Paris, and v/e had asked our ambassador to communicate it to the French Government.As regards Albania,  the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs said that he had little to add to the information contained in the telegrams already circulated.     He reminded his colleagues that italy&apos;s special position in Albania had been recognised after the :;&quot;a.r by the Conference of ambassadors.      It was therefore to be anticipatedthat, if Italy took any action in Albania, heraction would be taken in a manner which,  on formalgrounds, would not perhaps be open to strong criticism.     Our Ambassador at Rome proposed toask for an interview with Count Ciano that day in regard to Albanian affairs.
GERMANY.Return ofH.M. ambassador to Berlin.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(39) Con-elusion (2)).3, THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had been considering for some time the questionof the return of Sir Nevile Henderson to Berlin.      Asagainst his return it might be urged that this action might be regarded in this country and elsewhere aswiping the slate clean and as a sign of weakness.      OnF/5?.7.l/3^)3.   the other hand, he was anxious that we should not driftinto a position in which the withdrawal of our ambassador was treated as a punitive measure.      If the view wereto be taken that we could not have an Ambassador at berlin because of the unreliability of the Nazi regime,then it would seem that we could not keep an ambassador in Berlin so long as the Nazi regime endured.      Such aposition could not be accepted.      Further, so long as sir Nevile Henderson remained in this country, certain sections of opinion in Germany might perhaps be led tothink that we intended to attack Germany.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that hehad hesitated a good deal over this matter, but was nowin favour of Sir Nevile Henderson returning to Berlinafter Easter.    He asked whether the Cabinet would authorise the Prime Minister and himself, in consultation,to insert,  if they thought fit, a short notice in the newspapers to the effect that it was expected that sir Nevile Henderson would return to Berlin shortly after Easter.In reply to a question, the Secretary of state said that he thought the French Government were alsoanxious that their Ambassador should return.    It would,of course, be necessary to act in consultation with themin this matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that if theGermans were to take some further violent action, it
would &quot;be difficult again to withdraw our Ambassador.    he asked whether Sir Nevile Henderson was in a position tomaintain useful contacts.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Sir Nevile Hendersonsaw Field-Marshal Goering frequently, which, he thought,was of considerable importance.      THE LORD CHANCELLORadded that it was within his knowledge that our Ambassador ,maintained constant and effective touch with certain sections of German public opinion.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH suggested that it might beIdesirable that the statement as to the return of sir nevile Henderson to Berlin should be made after the8conversations with Colonel Beck had been concluded, sothat it would not appear that his return was a sign of weakness.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed.     While it would not be possible to make acomplete statement in regard to the Polish negotiations,he thought that a short communique could be issued onThursday or Friday.      This communique would give thegeneral impression that we had reached an understanding1with the Polish Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs emphasised that Sir Nevile Henderson had been called back&quot;to report&quot;, and that the longer his return was delayed     jjjjthe harder it would be to arrange for his return. IlTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND was infavour of Sir Nevile Henderson&apos;s return, on the groundthat for him to remain in this country might lend colour    if to rumours that we were attempting a policy of encircle-    If!ment.The Cabinet agreed:-To authorise the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation, to reach a decision and make an announcement in regard to the return ofSir Nevile Henderson to Berlin.
H(jJjAgD. 4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRSprevious said that on the morning of the previous day he had had reference:Lbinet IV (39))      two hours&apos; discussion with Colonel Beck and that thePrime Minister and himself had also had a longdiscussion with Colonel Beck the previous afternoon.Colonel Beck had been prepared, on behalf of hisGovernment, to pledge Poland to a mutual reciprocityarrangement with this country in the case of a direct attack on either party.      This arrangement would put uson the same basis vis a vis Poland as the French.   It hadbeen agreed that in any event this arrangement should operate during the interim period and pending theconclusion of the formal negotiationsoIn the second place he had discussed with colonel beck the question of extending the principle of reciprocity to cases in which Great Britain becameI involved in war with Germany as the result of a german attack on the west, e.g. against Holland, Belgium,Switzerland or Denmark.      On this point, Colonel Beckhad said that he had no instructions from his Government,and that he could not commit them.     Provided, however,that the arrangements for mutual reciprocity in the caseof direct attack on either party were made into apermanent arrangement, he would be prepared to agree thatthe question of extending this principle should be takeninto serious consideration by the Polish Government.Further than this he was not prepared to go.The question of Yugoslavia had been referred&apos; toin this connection, but Colonel Beck had taken the viewthat Yugoslavia was in a different position owing toher geographical position and should be dealt with aspart of the general Balkan problem.
Thirdly, Colonel Beck had indicated that hewas unwilling to extend the scope of the Polish-Roumanian Alliance,  (which was at present limited to aggresion against Poland and/or Roumania by Russia)to cover aggression by Germany or Hungary without prior consultation with Roumania,,     His reluctance todo this was due to the fact that he felt it would driveHungary into the arms of GermanyD      So long as herefrained from such action, he thought that the doorwould be left open for Polish influence to work onHungary and for the possible establishment in someindefinite form, of a front of Polish-Hungarian-Italianinfluence.It might be, however, that Colonel Beck&apos;sreal reasons for taking this view were, first, that hewould prefer that Roumania rather than Poland   shouldbe over-run by Germany, and, secondly, that ifRoumania was attacked and resisted, Poland could hope to intervene effectively, whereas Poland doubted whether if she was attacked by Germany, Roumania could afford her much help.Again Poland thought that the reasons which made it undesirable for her to give a guarantee to roumania also made it undesirable for us to take thiscourse.      The Polish Government were opposed to anyrigid system and desired something rather more elastic.The Foreign Secretary thought that an approach mightbe made to Colonel Beck on the folllowing lines:    if great Britain and France undertook to help Roumania if shewas attacked and resisted? could. we, in that event, count onPolish supporto      He thought it was possible that
Colonel Beck would be favourable to an approach onthese lines, although his own impression v/as that colonel Beck would not be able to commit hisBeck had/said that the position would be differentif Hungary became a German vassal state.      He thoughtthat Colonel Beck had some real hope that the positionof Hungary could be preserved, possibly through theinfluence of Italy and by means of some secretagreement in which Yugoslavia might also participate.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY then dealt with theposition of Russia.      It had been abundantly clearthat Colonel Beck was most unwilling to have anydealings with Russia apart from commercial arrangements and non-aggression pacts.      The Prime Minister had tried to persuade Colonel Beck that it would.be advantageous to Poland to be able to obtain suppliesof war material from Russia, but Colonel Beck had notresponded    to this suggestion.     He had made it clearthat if Great Britain and France entered into anycloser relationship with Russia, he would have tomake a public declaration to the effect that poland was not thereby affected.      In his view, germany would not raise opposition to a Franco-PolishGovernment on this point,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had asked&quot;Colonel Beck what was to be done if Germany were topresent Roumania with an ultimatum demanding,  for example,the right to receive all Roumanian oil and wheat, andthreatening if Roumania failed to give an affirmativeanswer within a few hours, say,  to lay Bucharest in ruins.M.  Beck replied that this was a matter for the Roumaniansto decide.      If they had sufficient courage,  they would decline to agree, and in his opinion assistance should inthat event be afforded to Roumania.     M. Beck could notpromise that Poland would give Roumania a specific fassurance of assistance if she resisted such German&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;demands,  since this v/as a matter on which he would have to consult the Roumanian Government. Colonel
Colonel Beck would, be favourable to an approach onthese lines, although his own impression was that colonel Beck would&quot; not be able to commit hisGovernment on this point,HE PRIME MINISTER said that he had nokodL-g,Colonel Beck whether, if Roumania was expose^r^to adirect threat by Germany, arising perhaps out of the allegation that she was not carding out her economicagreement, and Roumania^^e^frered resistance, andGreat Britain a ^r*&quot;France then went to war withGemanjSrfToland would come in as an ally.       ColonelB^ok had anoworod thio in tho affirmativoj      0olonelBeck had/said that the position would be differentif Hungary became a German vassal state.      He thoughtthat Colonel Beck had some real hope that the positionof Hungary could be preserved, possibly through theinfluence of Italy and by means of some secretagreement in which Yugoslavia might also participate.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY then dealt with theposition of Russia.      It had been abundantly clearthat Colonel Beck was most unwilling to have anydealings with Russia apart from commercial arrangements and non-aggression pacts.      The Prime Minister had tried to persuade Colonel Beck that it would.be advantageous to Poland to be able to obtain suppliesof war material from Russia, but Colonel Beck had notresponded    to this suggestion.      He had made it clearthat if Great Britain and Prance entered into anycloser relationship with Russia, he would have tomake a public declaration to the effect that poland was not thereby affected.      In his view, germany would not raise opposition to a Franco-Polish
arrangement or to an Anglo-Polish arrangement, hutthere would be an explosion if any combination ofPowers was formed in which Russia was involved.The Foreign Secretary said that he had discussed with Mr. Hudson that afternoon a suggestion by the latter that ttfjta tripartite blocs might be formed, namely, Great Britain, France and Russia, andGreat Britain, France and Poland.      He (the foreign secretary) was afraid, however, that such anarrangement might lead Colonel Beck to make hissuggested public declaration and that the result would be that we should either lose Polish supportaltogether or at least weaken the common front.     Hehad been surprised at the vigour and persistence ofColonel Beck&apos;s reactions to the Russian problem.The Foreign Secretary then summed up theposition as follows:    first, we had obtained, directreciprocity as an immediate arrangement;    secondly,we should press for indirect reciprocity in the eventof our becoming involved in war as the result of aGerman attack on the west;    thirdly, we must pressforward with consultations as to the position of roumania;    fourthly, we should press forward withthe Balkan problem generally irrespective of Poland&apos;sreactions, with a view to strengthening the balkan Entente.In regard to Roumania, he thought that itmight be desirable for us to explore, in consultationwith the Roumanian Government, the question of possible Polish assistance to Roumania.
In regard to Danzig, Colonel Beck had stated that no formal German demands had beenmade.     Indeed, so far there had only beenconversations and not formal negotiations.Colonel Beck had indicated that he was preparedto do a deal with Germany on the basis of improving the status of Germans in the Free City but within the framework of the present international arrangements.     While he was ready for anagreement with Germany, he would not acquiesce inforced settlement or a fait accompli.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the effecton his mind was that Colonel Beck was notanticipating any serious trouble in regard toDanzig either in the near future or later on.Colonel Beck seemed to think that he could get an arrangement with Germany on this matter which would give satisfaction to Germany while retaining what was essential to Poland.      Itmight, of course, be that Colonel Beck wasoptimistic in holding this view.
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY added that Colonel    -Beck&apos;s view was that, while Poland wished to avoidwar, Germany knew that war with Poland would he aserious proposition.     The one thing which hethought was likely to provoke German aggressionwould be a close association of Poland with Russia.The position of Poland in regard to munitions was then discussedo     The Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs said that Colonel Beckhad expressed himself optimistically as to armsproduction in Poland^Tm PRIME MINISTER said that he had askedColonel Beck whether Poland could maintain her outputof munitions during a long war and what coursewould be open to Poland when her resources had been exhausted, except to obtain munitions from Russia.To this Colonel Beck had in effect replied that hewas unwilling to come to any decision on this point at the moment, and he thought it would be better toleave this matter to be settled when the time camerather than to make an arrangement now which wouldcertainly provoke an explosion.The Prime Minister asked the Cabinet to appreciate that while the conversations with colonel beck had been by no means unsatisfactory, they had&quot;notturned out quite as we had expected*     The general attitude adopted by both the Liberal and labour opposition was that we had now returned to the policyof collective security*     They were thinking in termsof arrangements under which we should have anagreement with Turkey, Greece, Roumania and perhapsother Balkan States, the Baltic States and Russia - in
in effect, a Grand Alliance against Germany.The Prime Minister said that at the outset ofthese negotiations he had thought that we might perhaps have an understanding with Poland? Russia,Roumania, and later on with Turkey and Greece*.     Itwas clear, however, that wc should not secure anarrangement with Poland on these lines.   He read-out a statement published in the Daily Express that morning from their reporter at Warsaw to the effectthat Poland was ready to sign with Britain a bilateral Treaty similar to the Treaty signedbetween Poland and Prance in 1921, but that poland would not set her pen to any new system of collective security.   We were thus offered by Polandnot even a Three-Power Pact, but a Two-Power Pact,and every attempt which we had made to suggest that other Powers should be brought into the arrangementhad been quietly but firmly resisted by colonel beck.The Prime Minister said that he had veryconsiderable distrust of Russia, and had no confidence that we should obtain active and constantsupport from that country.   Mr. Hudson had informed him that while he had been treated in a friendly wayby everyone in Russia, he had formed an impression that Russia would be of little or no assistance,except for defensive purposes.     If this was correct,and if an arrangement which included Russia wouldbe likely to cause an explosion, the question ofmaking any arrangement with Russia was obviously oneWhich required a great deal of further consideration.
The Prime Minister said, he was by no meansindisposed to negotiate a Two-Power Pact with Poland.After all, Poland was the hey to the situation, and an alliance with Poland would ensure that Germany would been gaged in a war on two fronts.   At the same time, itwould be necessary to take the utmost care as to the presentation of this arrangement if the Governmentwere to avoid a considerable outcry and criticism.Poland&apos;s policy was to avoid quarrelling with either of the two big neighbours between which she was placed, and he thought that it was quite possible thatthe Polish Government would have no objection tosaying that it would not be in accordance with their general policy that they should enter into an alliance with either Germany or Russia.It was also necessary to consider Roumania&apos;position.     It was clear that Roumania felt the samesort of objection as Poland to any arrangement which included Russia.    The Prime Minister said that his mainconclusion was, therefore, that we should not make any statement which purported to cover the whole position.Our next step should be to convert our- temporary arrangements with Poland into a permanent arrangement and to secure that the principle of mutualreciprocity in the case of direct attack was extendedto cases in which we were involved in war throughGerman attack on other countries.       After that, wecould proceed to consider what further steps could be- IS -
taken.In the course of discussion, the foreign secretary said that he thought it might he desirable for him to see the RussianAmbassador somewhat more frequently than inthe past so as to avoid any suspicion that wewere cold-shouldering RussiaoTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE saidthat the fact that we had reached an arrangement with Poland was likely to divert Germany&apos;attack to some other direction0    It was thereforeall the more necessary to continue negotiations -in regard to other countries, particularly inregard to RoumaniaaTHE PRIME MINISTER said he agreed, and also referred to the great desirability that poland should extend her obligations under the mutualreciprocity agreement to cases of indirect attacksAt the same time, there must be no illusions as tothe difficulties of the situations   Many of thesmaller States whom we might seek to include in these arrangements would not, from the military point ofview, represent an added source of strengthoGermanyrs position in the centre of Europe,moving on interior lines, was one of considerablestrategic strengths   Mr0 Hudson had informed him that he had been shocked by the attitude of M.Sandier who had taken the view that Sweden must make terms with germany     It seemed clearthat we should obtain no help from that quartere
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that hethought Roumania represented the danger spot.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it would he difficult for Germany to tackle Roumania directly.    He thought thatif Herr Hitler had designs on i;toumanla he would he likelyto work through Hungary.    He would not be surprised to seean attempt made by Germany to obtain control over Jiungary.In reply to questions, THE SECRETARY OP STATE PORFOREIGN AFFAIRS said that up to the present no discussions had taken place with Colonel Beck in regard either tothe Jewish and refugee problems, or as to colonies, or onthe question of a loan to Poland.Reverting to Hungary, he said that we in this country had been apt to take the view that Hungary might fall under german domination at any time, and we had thought that itwould be difficult to build up a front against Germanegression which would include Hungary.    In view of colonel beck&apos;s attitude we should perhaps reconsider our ideas onthis point.    Colonel Beck thought differently, and theForeign Secretary felt that the right course would be thatwe should encourage him in this attitude and ascertain what action Poland would take if Germany attempted to seizeor dominate Hungary.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA pointed out that thedesire expressed by Poland and Hungary to have a common frontier appeared to indicate at least an intention to standtogether in resisting German aggression.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS questioned whether we were doing enough by way of propaganda in Hungary.If war had broken out,- we should now be spending considerablesums in buying up newspapers and similar action, as we had
done in Roumania and Spain in the last War.    The germans were very active in a number of countries, such as Spain,Portugal, Hungary and Roumania..    He thought it would be worth while to consider whether we should attempt to meet this propaganda now by the same methods as we should adopt in war-time.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR expressed strongagreement with this view, and said that propaganda mightbe the cheapest way of breaking down this form of attack.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he would look into this matter, but he was afraid that the question would resolve itself into one of theamount of money which could be made available for thispurpose.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA asked whetherreliable account had been received from an eye-witnessof Herr Hi tier&apos;s speech.at Wilhelmshaven,THE SECRETARY OF STATE.FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS repliedin the negative.    The best explanation which he hadreceived, though it was no more than a surmise, was thatthe glass erection, from behind which Herr Hitler had spoken, had concealed some device for providing air ina form which would relieve Herr Hitler&apos;s asthma, and thatthe broadcasting had been switched off on the ground that herr Hitler&apos;s voice might give an impression of physicalWeakness.In reply to another question the Foreign secretary said that Colonel Beck did not take the view that anattack by Germany had been or was imminent, although hehad agreed that it was impossible to be certain whatwould happen in these days,
The Cabinet -(1)    took note of the statements by thePrime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs as to the conversations with Colonel Beck:(2)    authorised the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs tocontinue with the conversations on thegeneral lines indicated in the discussion:(3)    invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to consider whether further steps should be taken by way of propaganda to counteract German propaganda activities.
VISIT OP THEjBENCH air minister.previous^ReferencesCabinet 15 (39,Conclusion 9)5.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR gave an account of the visit of the French Air Minister.M. La Chambre had given a very candid account ofthe position in the French aircraft industry.The Secretary of State gave his colleaguescertain particulars in regard to this matter whichare recorded in a separate note in the Secretary&apos;standard file of Cabinet Conclusions.&apos;The Secretary of State for Air said that anumber of practical conclusions had been reached inregard to a measure of standardisation of machines and equipment in the future.     He had also made an offer to supply France with a certain number of complete aircraft and of aircraft engines.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that theChief of the Imperial General Staff, who had just returned from France, gave an extremely good accountof the French Army materiel and of their productionarrangements.     He thought that there were certainweapons which we might obtain from France, possibly in exchange for the^supplies of aircraft and airengines.The Cabinet took note of the statements made by the Secretary of State for air and the Secretary of State for War.
PALESTINE.previousfeeference:[Cabinet 14 (39)Jconclusion 5.)6.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat, owing to his absence, it had been necessary to delay the last stages of preparation of the white paper setting out the Governments policy in regard to palestine.     In any event, however, it would have beendesirable to postpone the issue of the Paper in viewof the European situation.      The present arrangement was that the Palestine Committee would meet onThursday afternoon, and the draft White Paper would besubmitted to the next Meeting of the Cabinet for their approval.     In the meantime, informal discussions were continuing with certain individuals who had beenmembers of the delegations to the Conferences.The Cabinet took note of this statement.(At this point the Secretary of Statefor. Foreign Affairs left the Meeting..)
HOSPITALORGANISATION.7.     The Cabinet had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland (CP.-77 (39)) onthe question of Emergency Hospital Organisation for civilian and Service casualties in time of war.     Theministers pointed out the inadequacy of existing arrangements in England and Wales and in Scotland,and described tentative steps which had already beenIItaken with a view to increasing hospital accommoda--tion.     For the reasons set forth in their Memorandum,and in the interests of economy and uniformity ofadministration, they made the following recommenda-tions to the Cabinet(a) That approval should be given to theprinciple of unified control of allthe emergency hospital accommodation,whether for civilian or service requirements in this country;    and(b) That a Committee of Ministers shouldbe set up to consider the extent towhich additional accommodation oughtto be provided.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH explained the main points in the Memorandum.     It was impossible toprovide hospital accommodation on a   modern basis for all the air raid casualties which might beanticipated in the first two or three weeks of v/ar,and he thought that the question of the extentto which additional accommodation should be providedv/as one which must be settled by Ministers.There was the further point that air raidcasualties were expected to fall off after thefirst month or so, whereas casualties in the expeditionary Force were likely to rise after the initial period.     This pointed to an arrangement
9^9fcl t J Wfor pooling resources, and he thought that itwould he desirable that the Cabinet should formallyapprove the principle of unified control for allhospital emergency accommodation, whether for civilianor Service requirements.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 7/AR said that he hoped the Cabinet would not approve the principleset out in Recommendation (a) aboveo     His view v/asthat it was essential that the military authoritiesshould nave their own hospitals.      Last Septemberhe had undertaken not to mobilise 25 out of 29Territorial hospitals.     This had been a temporary arrangements.     He thought that this question was oneto be considered by the proposed Cabinet Committee.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he alsowished to raise certain points on this proposal.Thus he wished to be sure that certain hospitals wouldbe available for the Royal Air Force.      But these point would be dealt with by the Cabinet Committee.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he was working on the principles which had been laid down and agreedto last September.      It was pointed out in paragraph  of his Memorandum that units could be transferred tothe Services if and when the need arose.There was some discussion whether the questionof the extent to which the additional accommodationprovided was a matter which required the attentionof a Ministerial Committee.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that since it was impracticable to provide hospital accommodation forthe total number of casualties on the present forecast,
the task of settling the extent of the accomodation to be provided, involved a big question of policy,which must be left to Ministers.In connection with discussion on a lateritem (conclusion 14), the Minister of Health saidthat if an immediate emergency took place and orders were given for the mobilisation for all theTerritorial Hospitals, this would wreck the schemefor civil hospitals as at present arranged,THE PRIME MINISTER invited the Ministers concerned to reach an agreement in regard to this matter, to govern the immediate situation, without further reference to the Cabinet.After discussion it was agreed -(1) That a Committee comprising:-&apos;The Lord Privy seal the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster,The First Lord of the Admiralty,,The Secretary of State for War,S/S  rv $c ftl&amp;t+^L.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR T&quot;AR said that.BRITISH TROOPSPROM INDIA, the Cabinet Committee on Defence Programmes andtheir Acceleration at a meeting held on the 23rdMarch had approved in principle the immediatewithdrawal from India of certain British unitswhose release had been proposed in the Reportof the Chatfield Committee.    It had been decidedthat the first step was that the 17ar Office should discuss the matter with the India Office, and thelatter had now replied that the Government of Indiaand the Secretary of State for India were preparedto release the British units forthwith, if HisMajesty&apos;s Government were definitely of opinionthat the international situation demanded their release.   The units in question were 2 infantry battalions, 1 Medium Regiment of Royal Artillery,1 Cavalry Regiment and 3 Batteries of HorseArtillery,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR INDIA said thatthe Government of India were willing to releasethese troops on the understanding that their withdrawal was considered to be really important.He wished to point out, however, that the ChatfieldReport had contemplated that India could sparecertain troops on two conditions - first, if theremaining troops were modernised, and, secondly, ifthe British Exchequer helped to find the money formodernisation.   Neither of these two conditionshad yet been fulfilled.   He must therefore enter the caveat that if the recommendations of the chatfield Report were not adopted India might haveto ask for the return of the troops now to be
99^m W vreleased 0THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEexplained, that it had originally been proposedthat British units should be withdrawn first, andthat at a later stage the number of Indian troops should gradually be reduced.    It was now proposedto ask India to reduce a number of Indianbattalions at an earlier date     Perhaps this woulddispose the Government of India to view thepresent proposal more favourably,,THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the main point at issue was that the international situation was such as to necessitate the immediaterelease of these British units by India, and he   -thought that there would be no doubt that thiswas in fact the case.The Cabinet agreedthat the British units mentionedin the first paragraph of this conclusion should be withdrawn from india forthwith.
INCREASE INTHE STRENGTHOP THEREGULAR ARMY.(previous reference cabinet 15(39), Con-clusion 5. )9.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thatthe Regular Army was at the present time 19,000short of establishment.    There was also an estimated wastage in the current year of 30,000oFurther, there were substantial deficiencies whichhad&quot; existed for a long time, and which could onlybe remedied by an increase in establishment.    Inthe result he required in the current year anintake of 100,000 men for the Regular Army.It had been known for some time that asubstantial increase would be required, and hehad informed the Treasury in this sense at thetime of the submission of the Estimates.    Hehad decided, however, not to ask for theinclusion of any additional figure in theEstimates pending decisions on the ChatfieldReport.The changes in the internationalposition, and in the role of the Field Force now made it necessary to take immediate steps to remedy the position.    The Field Force could notbe mobilised without an addition to its strength.Garrisons abroad were below war establishment, andthe same was true of the 13 short tour battalionsnow abroad.    At the Cabinet on 29th March(Cabinet 15 (39) Conclusion 5) a rapid decisionhad been taken to double the strength of theTerritorial Army.    On that occasion he had askedwhether he could supplement his statement as tothe doubling of the Territorial Army by astatement regarding the Regular Army, bU;t it hadbeen decided that this statement should be made ona separate occasion.    The Minister for Co-ordination
of Defence had. examined the figures and was satisfied as to the need for this increase.    Hethought that it was of the utmost importance that advantage should he taken of the present wave ofenthusiasm for the Territorial Army, to improverecruitment for the Regular Army.    He was reluctant to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who hadbeen so helpful to him, for further increases which would result in substantial additions to the burdens on the Exchequer; at the same time he attached great importance to being able to make an early announcement,  if possible before Easter as tothe increase in strength of the Regular Army.   In replyto the Secretary of State for India, the Secretaryof State for War said that in order to obtain thenumber of recruits required in the current year itwould be necessary to offer a number of inducements,such as marriage allowances at a lower age and ashortening of the period of the service with thecolours from 7 to 5 years.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had agreed to this matter being mentioned at  theCabinet.    At the same time he thought that hiscolleague would probably feel that it was a littledifficult to deal with a matter which involved sosubstantial an increase at the present meetingwithout further consideration.    For himself, hehad not appreciated that the increase contemplatedwas so large.    He suggested that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Minister for Co-ordination of -Defence and the Secretary of State for War shouldbe asked to consider this matter.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said, thatthe previous week he had agreed to proposals to double the Territorial Army in somewhat specialcircumstances.    He felt that it was impossiblefor him, having agreed to this very large increase,to accept this further very large commitment.    Thetotal liability thus involved was more than wecould possibly bear, and he must ask the Secretaryof State for War to reduce his proposals.    Hethought it was only right that he should make hisposition in the matter plain.After further discussion it was agreedTo invite the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence and theSecretary of State for War toconsider the proposed increase tothe strength of the Regular Army.
PUBLIC HEALTH 10.      THE MINISTER OF HEALTH explained that this(COAL MINEprFUSS) BILL. Bill would come up for Keport and Third. Reading(previous on Friday, the 31st April.     The Bill had. alreadyReference:Cabinet 56 (38) been before the Cabinet, when it had been decidedConclusion 8)that the Government Spokesman should express generalsympathy with the principle behind the Bill.     Fromthe point of view of his Department, there was noobjection to having this Bill on the Statute Book.In the course of discussion, THE LORDCHANCELLOR pointed to defects in the drafting ofthe Bill.     In his view the provision in the bill relating.to a deposit &quot;liable to spontaneouscombustion&quot;, unless further defined, was for all practical purposes almost meaningless.After some discussion,  the Cabinet agreed:That the Government Spokesman on theBill should indicate that, while theBill had the Government!s generalsympathy, it stood in need of amendmentbefore it could be regarded as a usefulmeasure.

paredness,Uvio us[ference:ftinet 14 (39)fonclusion 3)14o      THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEreferred to the series of crises which had taken placein recent months when the possibility of an imminentattack on this country had been envisaged.     The lastsuch occurrence had taken place in the previous twenty-four hoursy and related to the possibility of an attackon the Fleet (See Telegram No0 223 from Berlin)0Our war preparations were drawn up on theassumption that there would be a certain period betweenthe declaration of an emergency and an outbreak of war.If there were no such interval our existing machinerydid not function.      There was also the risk of one service being asked to make preparations to meet animminent attack without similar steps being taken byother Services.     He thought that it was essential toensure a system whereby, if there was any fear of a sudden attack, the news would be communicated to all those concerned, and that there should be a priorunderstanding as to the action which should be taken0In the second place, the Minister suggestedthat if we had to face the prospect of living for sometime in a period when we might be subjected to a numberof alarms, the right course would be to make arrangements which would operate more or less continuously,instead of having to prepare arrangements hurriedly and at short notice, with the risk of creating disturbance inthe public mind.      He thought, therefore, that all three Service Departments should be instructed tomaintain some condition of continuous readinessoFor example, it might be necessarj&apos; that one flight ineach group should be continuously available for actioneThe perpetual readiness of a proportion of the troops on the North-West Frontier illustrated the sort of
precautions he had in mind.The Minister also referred to the risk of attackon the Fleet from the air or by submarines.The Minister concluded by saying that his proposal was that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to make proposals, which should be put before the StrategicalAppreciation Committee on the following day.     He wouldthen report the views of his colleagues to the Prime Minister.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR supported thisproposal.     He thought it undesirable that we should be ina position of having repeatedly to order measures of defencepreparedness and then- to cancel them.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY referred to thestatement he had made the previous night, which, he said,had only been intended to convey the impression that the preparations in the Fleet were so arranged that the anti-aircraft guns could be manned at any time. He said thatthe Naval Staff did not rate highly the danger of a suddensubmarine attack at Sheerness or Portsmouth.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was glad that theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence had made this proposal.He, was clear that it was necessary that we should adapt our arrangements to present-day conditions.     He thought thatthe Lord Privy Seal*s Department should be included in thearrangements contemplated.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL agreed, but pointed out that civil Defence was in a somewhat different position from theServices, which were entrusted to Service personnel.     Hethought it would be very difficult to take action to bring a civil Defence scheme into a state of readiness without causing public alarm.
In further discussion THE MINISTER OP HEALTHexplained the situation which had arisen in the House ofCommons the previous evening as the result of the somewhatmisleading reports which had been received of the FirstLord&apos;s speechoTHE PRIME MINISTER also explained the action whichhad been taken with a view to discouraging the dissemination of misleading accounts of the First Lord&apos;s speechoTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE raised theQuestion whether the offices of the Civil departments should be closed for EasterQAfter discussion it was agreed that a responsibleofficer should be present throughout the day and nightover the holidays in every Department concerned with theimmediate introduction of Defence measures in the event ofemergencyoThe Cabinet agreed:(l)    To invite the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence to ask the Chiefs of Staff anda representative of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;office  to prepare a statement showing what steps should be taken in order to maintainsome condition of continuous readinessduring the situation likely to prevail inthe next few months, thus avoidingconstant change of orders:(2)    That this Report should be considered at aMeeting of the Strategical AppreciationCommittee to be held on the following day:(3)    To authorise the Prime Minister and theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence toissue the necessary instructions to departments in the light of this Report:(4)    That the Secretary to the Cabinet should issue instructions to all DepartmentsnV**. 2.6 t$q)n.        concerned with the immediate introductionof Defence measures in the event ofemergency to the effect that a responsibleofficer should be available in each department night and day over the Easterholiday and until further notice0

VISIT OF THEFRENCH air minister.MOST SECRET.CABINET 18 (59),  CONCLUSION 5.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that the visit;of the French Air Minister had been a depressing affair,although he hoped that he (the Secretary of State) had beenable to make some useful suggestions.The present position of the French Air Force wasmeagre and weak.      Their output in the preceding monthhad been 107 operational machines and 90 trainers.     About    fa year ago, however, the monthly average had not been morethan 35 or 40;    while the actual production from April 1938to March 1939 had been 716, against a programme total of1,800.     The French Government had a number of national factories, but there were only two substantial private firms employed in aircraft production.     The workers were now working longer hours $ and the total number of workersin the industry was now some 37,000 (January, 1939) ascompared with 87,000 a year ago.      The French did not seemto have grasped the underlying features of large-scale production, and their ultimate objective was production at the rate of 300-330 machines a month.     It seemed clearthat, so long as the French only aimed at a rate ofproduction of this kind, they would not achieve it.      our experience had shown that industry tended to prolong theexecution of orders, unless orders were sufficiently largeto ensure that the operat:0.r,s were fully engaged.      If anemergency arose in the next few weeks or months, it was obvious that most of the air operations in defence of both countries would fall upon us in this country.A number of practical conclusions had been reachedIt had been agreed in principle that in future we should. have the same types of machines and equipment, while animmediate offer had been made to the French of a certain
number of training machines and &quot;Battles&quot;.The French were also in an awkward positionin regard to aircraft engines.      We had offered to sellthem 300 and then they had asked for more.      We had ourown engine difficulties, but we should try to meet theFrench over the matter.     Experts of the two countries were to meet at once,  and it was hoped that, althoughany improvements now made would take some time tobecome effective, we would give the French all the helpin our power.The French air personnel had both capacitj&apos; andcourage, but he could not speak very highly of theexisting machines in the French Air Force.

hlTUATION:$mLBMIA.7(previous reference:Cabinet 18(39), Con-elusion 2.)THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explainedthat it had been decided to summon a Meetingof those Ministers who were available at short notice. He proposed that a statement tothis effect should be communicated to the Pressafter the meeting.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he was glad of an opportunity of consulting some of his colleagues.     The informa-tion which   he had received the previous afternoonshowed that the position in Albania was extremelyobscure.       This helped him to decide betweenthe four courses immediately open, namely;enquiry, protest, threats, or action.     It seemed clear that, at the present stage, the right course was to make enquiries.       Accordingly,telegrams had been despatched to Belgrade,Athens, Angora, and other Capitals, to ascertain what information the Governments in question hadreceived, and how they viewed the position.     Atelegram had also been despatched to our ambassador at Rome (No. 165) indicating that we found it difficult to reconcile the reports ofwhat v/as taking place with the assuranceswhich had been made to us by the representativesof the Italian Government, and saying that wewere gravely perturbed about the position.The Foreign Secretary then read out to theCabinet telegram No. 288 from the Earl of Perth,reporting the upshot of an interview which hehad had with   Count Ciano on 7th April.    Inthis interview, Count Ciano had given an accountOf the position in Albania ?/hich was altogether
at variance with the information published in the newspapers.A further telegram had been sent to the Larl ofPerth on the 7th April (telegram No. 168) instructing him again to seek an interview with Count Ciano.No reply, however, to this telegram had yet beenreceived.The Foreign Secretary said that he had also donehis best to give the Press the necessary background.He had explained to them that the situation wasobscure and that it was undesirable that they should reach any very definite conclusions until more was known of the position.The attitude of other Governments seemed to beas follows.It was clear that Yugoslavia did not intend totake any action^.     There was some suggestion that she might perhaps have reached a secret understanding with Italy.The Government in Greece were watching theposition very closely.     So long as Albania onlywas concerned, they were unlikely to take any action;but if the present situation developed further, it seemed certain that they would be on our side.The attitude of Turkey was the same as that of greece.No particular information had been received as to the attitude of France.    He hoped to seeM. Corbin later in the day.The Foreign Secretary said that Signor mussolini had sent a telegram to the Prime Minister onthe previous afternoon (reproduced in telegramNo. 167 to Rome) to the    effect   that   he    had read   with   great   interest   the   Prime
Minister1s statement in the House of Commons aboutAlbania, and giving him a formal assurance thatthe solution of the Italo-Albanian question wouldtake place in such a form as not to provoke a crisis in Anglo-Italian relations or in theinternational situation in general.As regards the Anglo-Italian Agreement,the Foreign Secretary said that if, in thecourse of a few days, the Italian Government came to some arrangement which left unimpaired the sovereignty, and frontiers of Albania, it mightbe contended that such an arrangement was within the letter, at any rate, of the Anglo-Italian Agreement.     He emphasised, however, thatthe situation was extremely obscure.     We had had no information in the last 24 hours from our minister at Durazzoe     It was stated on thetape-machine that Tirana had been capturedearly that morning, after riots had taken place,King Zog having given orders for the prisoners to be released.The Foreign Secretary said he thought there were two groups of questions which it wouldbe useful to consider that mornings     First,what should be done about Albania itself;    and,secondly, the political side of the pr-oblem.As regards the former, it looked as thoughthe invasion of Albania had been deliberately timedto take place during the Easter Recess, and as a
riposte to the Anglo-Polish Agreement.     Againit looked like a demonstration by the Dictatorsagainst the Western Powers.     No doubt public-opinion in certain countries, such as America,would be likely to take the view that, while we used brave words, our action was less heroic.Nevertheless, the Foreign Secretary continued,he felt that Yugo-Slavia was the key of thepresent situation, and he thought that it wasimpossible that we should take a more forwardline in this matter than Yugo-Slavia took.     he mentioned that Mr. Winston Churchill, whom he&apos; had spoken to the previous evening? had taken this view.     The Foreign Secretary felt,therefore, that it would be impossible for us tosend a Fleet to the Adriatic in order to bombard theItalian forces at Valona or Durazzo.     Nor didhe feel that it would really be right to starta European war by sending Signor Mussolini an ultimatum on this matter which he could not accept.     The present episode, however, showed the insecurity in this part of Europe also, andit would be right that we should take early stepsto reach agreements with both Greece and Turkey,which would make it clear that we would tolerateno interference with these two countries.      his conclusion, therefore, was that we should not go towar   about Albania, but should endeavour to securefurther time, which we should use to improve ourposition.
If we accepted this conclusion, we had thenWarships to consider how it should be presented.      In thisiji Italianports. connection, it should be remembered that a certainnumber of our warships were at present visiting Italianports.      The Admiralty had enquired the previous daywhether orders should at once be issued for the ships toleave, but he had advised that the situation was tooobscure and that a decision should be deferred for themoment.     He thought, in present circumstances, thatthe right course was that these ships should now leaveItalian ports.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theships concerned were at San Remo and in the Bay of Naples.They were visiting Italian ports as part of the normalSpring cruise and had had a good reception.      Unlessspecial arrangements were made,&apos;they would not leavethese ports until Monday at the earliest.In discussion, it was agreed that it was undesirable that these ships should remain in Italianports over the Easter Holidays, since it would be very undesirable that the crews of our ships should beexchanging hospitality with the Italians at the present justice.     It was agreed that orders should at once begiven that the ships in question should withdraw to Malta.Some discussion then ensued as to what reasons,if any, should be given for this-fiction.    It was at firstsuggested that no reason should, be given;    but it was felt that as soon as the news of the withdrawal of theships became known, there would be considerable enquiriesfrom the Press in this country.      It v/as also felt thatit might be desirable to give some indication to theItalian Government as to the reasons for the withdrawal ofthe ships.     It was agreed that the explanation given
should include a reference to the obscurity of the presentposition and  to the possibility that embarrassing incidentsmight arise.      The meeting agreed that the Foreign Officeand the Admiralty should concert together as to the formof words to be used in this connection.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY then asked what furthercould be done to make our disapproval of the Italianaction.One suggestion was that we should with drawour Ambassador.     He would, however, feel considerablehesitation about this course, since it was easier towithdraw an Ambassador than to secure his return once hehad been withdrawn.     He also thought that we should haveto make a protest;   but in his view our real answer should be that we should establish muoh closer relationswith Greece and Turkey.Some  discussion then ensued as to Italy&apos;special position in. Albania.      The Italo-Albanian agreement was a published document.      In effect, Italy had had aprotectorate over Albania for a number of years.     At the ambassadors Conference in 1921 a resolution had been passedwhich gave Italy the right to enter Albania and restoreAlbanian frontiers.      This right had been granted to italy as some compensation for refusal to allow Italy to annex the coast line of Albania. THE FOREIGN secretary said that, in effect, the position was that if it wasnecessary to restore order in Albania, the duty
of restoring order rested on Italy, subject to various formalities being carried out.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it seemed dear that the present juncture did not justifyus in taking steps which would result in a european war.      It was, however, necessary that we should so-conduct ourselves so that we should not appear to condoneaggression while, at the same time, we should notindulge in such strong rebukes as to make ourselvesappear in a weak position.THE SECRETARY OP STaTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSthan referred to the telegram which had been despatched to Lord Perth on the previous evening (telegram No. 168)instructing him to seek an immediate interview withCount Ciano.      He said that a reply had now been receivedfrom Lord Perth enquiring whether he (the foreign secretary) had received telegram No.  288 and asking whether, in the light of that telegram, the instructions given in Foreign Office telegram No.  168 still stood,or should be amended.The Foreign Secretary said that it would benecessary to send a reply to the Earl of Perth.     Hethought that the instructions already given should stand.      It was suggested, however, that this replymight be linked up with a message as to the reasonsfor withdrawing our ships from Italian ports, onthe lines already indicated.
Relations THE CHANCELLOR OR THE EXCHEQUER said that hewith   turkey and Greece.        appreciated that it had been intended that consultationwith Turkey should take place after the discussions,.with poland and Roumania had been completed;    but v/e had always had it in mind that Turkey was of greatimportance to us;    the present events in Albaniamade it very important that we should get on goodterms with Turkey at an early date.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed with this view.He reminded his colleagues that our intention hadbeen first to make an arrangement between ourselves,France, Poland and Roumania.      Poland had been doubt-ful as to the inclusion of the latter country untilshe had herself approached Roumania, and he had beenuncertain whether until Roumanian negotiations were settled, we should ourselves enter into discussions with Turkey and Greece.      He had, however, kept both these countries informed of the position generally.      Hethought that probably our real answer to Italy&apos;s action would be a far more closer arrangement than we had previously contemplated with both Greece and Turkey.Hitherto we had always been influenced by the fear that such an arrangement might give offence to signor mussolini.      It would be a matter for considerationlater when   further information had been received,whether we should inform Signor Mussolini that wewere taking action on these lines.
THE HOME SECRETARY said, that in talks whichhe had had with Colonel Beck and the Polish Ambassador,he had reached the conclusion that it would take a longtime before any definite arrangement was reached withregard to Roumania.      He thought that Colonel Beckwas determined to take no action which v/ould beunfavourably received by Hungary.      He therefore thoughtthat the right course would be to isolate our arrangements with Greece and Turkey from the Roumanianquestion.Some discussion then ensued as to whether,  ifwe were at once to make an alliance with Turkey,this would lead Signor Mussolini to take some further action.      One view expressed was that the invasion of Albania should not be taken too lightly;that it was a move of the -utmost significance - aclosely laid plan taken in concert with Germany whichwould result in closing the Adriatic and bottlingup Yugoslavia.      On the other hand,  the view was expressed that the fact that the Chiefs of staff had always recognised that Italy could close the adriatic,  that an attack by Italy on Yugoslavia wasnot thought to be probable, and that Signor Mussolinimight well have been encouraged to embark on thisadventure because he knew that it was an easy task, and would
give him a cheap triumph.     It was also suggestedthat it might he intended to dethrone King Zog and set up some other Albanian Chief as King and that theItalians would then set up a Protectorate, and obtainthe right to fortify certain ports.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that if therumours which had been circulating in the last 24 hourswere all to be believed, it would be quite certain thatthis was part of some general move.     For his ownpart, however, he considered that these rumours wereill-founded.     He thought that we should not go towar in regard to Albania, but that we should make itclear to Turkey and Greece that if they were attackedwe should do our best to help them.     Looking at thematter from the point of view of the map of Europe, theonly countries in regard to which our policy was not clear were Yugoslavia, Roumania and Hungary.     colonel beck had shown him (the Foreign Secretary) a letterfrom the Hungarian Foreign Minister giving assurances that Hungary would take no improper action with regardto Roumania.     It must also be remembered that colonel beck had given an assurance that if Germany tried to occupyHungary and Hungary resisted, Poland would resist also
if that happened it would he necessary thatwe should come to their help. .    Our nextstep should he. to make an arrangement with turkey  and Greece.       At the same time hethought that we should not take action in thisdirection until the situation was somewhatclearer.     If, however, Turkey and Greece shouldhe threatened, we should have to move very quickly.THE HOME SECRETARY, who said that he waspersonally familiar with conditions in Albania,referred to the bands of comitadji which movedfreely across the frontiers.      A situation might well develop in which there was continuousguerilla warfare on the frontiers. 1  He hopedthat we should avoid a situation that gave aguarantee to Greece of her frontiers when therewas, in fact, no clearly defined frontier.Proposed THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER then referredRecall ofParliament. to the letter which the Leader of the labour opposition had sent to the Prime Minister asking that Parliament should be recalled at the earliest opportunity.       This matter v/as, of course, closely connected with the date of the Prime Minister&apos; return.In the course of discussion it was pointedout that there.were already signs in the Press that
if the Prime Minister were to remain in scotland for any long time his absence v/ould be liable tobe misrepresented.       It was explained that thePrime Minister had suggested returning on Fridaynight but had Toe en dissuaded from doing so.After a discussion it was agreed that a message should be sent to the Prime Minister tothe effect that the opinion of the Ministers presentfavoured sending a reply at once to Mr. Attlee tothe effect that Parliament would be summoned to meetone day in the next week;    and that in order toavoid undue pressure a fairly clear indicationshould be given that Parliament v/ould be summoned to meet on, say, Wednesday, the 12th or Thursday,the 13th April.      If no such definite indicationwas given as to the date of the Meeting, this/ould be liable to increase the pressure for themeeting of Parliament.       In this connection itwas pointed out that if fighting in Albaniacontinued, public feeling on the matter was likelyto run high.THE HOME SECRETARY referred to the considerableAlbanian community in the United States, which hethought would make United States public opinionon this matter more sensitive.
