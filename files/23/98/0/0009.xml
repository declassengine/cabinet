1.      THE PRIME MINISTER regretted to have interruptedhis colleagues&apos; holidays, hut in the circumstances itwas inevitable that the Cabinet should meet to hear thelatest information and to take stock of the situation.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the members of the Cabinet would not yet have seen the records of the numerous conversations which he had had ;in the last few days with representatives of othercountries, although they would no doubt be familiar with the general course of events as reported in the newspapers, starting with the Italian invasion of Albaniaon Good Friday.      He had seen the French and UnitedStates Ambassadors on Saturday afternoon, 8th April.The former had seen matters in very much the same lightas ourselves;    that is to say, that the Italian action was, in some degree, a riposte to the Anglo-Polish pact.The Foreign Secretary added that, since Saturday,certain evidence had accumulated which made him thinkthat the theory of a riposte was perhaps not altogetheraccurate, since it appeared that,prior to her invasion of Albania, Italy had given very little warning of herintentions to Germany and that Germany was not altogetherpleased with Italy&apos;s action,,THE PRIME MINISTER interposed that it seemed clear that this invasion had been planned long beforethe Anglo-Polish Agreement had been signed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the United States Ambassador had said that he would endeavour to keep the Press in his country as steadyas possible, and would try to secure that criticismin this matter was not directed against this country.
On Saturday evening lie had also seen theAlbanian Minister, who had delivered a note protesting against the action taken by. the Italian Government in violation of all international treaties voluntarilyaccepted and signed by that Government and appealingto His Majesty&apos;s Government to do its utmost to helpa small nation desparately attempting to defend itsown territory.      He had replied that he would lose no time in placing the matter before his colleagues, andthe Minister had added that he hoped Albania could at least count on our moral support.The Foreign Secretary said that at the Conferenceof Ministers whiC-i had been held on Saturday, he had expressed the view that it would be impossible forthis country to take a more forward line in this matterthan Yugoslavia was prepared to take.      In his view it was not incumbent upon us to plunge the whole of Europeinto war over Albania, having regard to the extent towhich Italian interests in Albania had already &quot;been recognised.      He thoxigat, however, that the presentepisode showed how necessary it was that we should take steps to reach agreements with Greece and Turkey whichwould make it clear that we should not tolerate any interference with those two countries.On Saturday evening Signor Crolla, the ItalianCharge dfAffaires, had asked to be received urgently.Signor Crolla had said that Signor Mussolini had beenpuzzled by the tone of the British Press and by thecommuniciue issued after the Meeting of Ministers, whichreferred to &quot;some obscurity in the situation!.&apos;     signor mussolini therefore wished to make certain comments inorder to clear the situation.     These points, which are set out in full in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s note of his interview, included the following:-
(l) That Italian interests had been pre-eminentfor a century in Albania and had been expressly recognised by the Conference of ambassadors:(2) Italy&apos;s colossal expenditure in Albania:(3) That King Zog had betrayed his people;    andthat the Treaty settlement offered by italy provided for the political independence of Albaniae(4) That the help of the Italian Governmenthad been invoked by many elements inAlbania,(5) That Yugoslavia and Greece were perfectlycalm:(6) That the Anglo-Italian Agreement of lastApril was not prejudiced?(7) That the occupation of Albania would becompleted in a few days, with the fullconsent of the Albanian people0Signor Crolla had added that, speaking personally,he was apprehensive of the attitude which the Sundaynewspapers might take.     Thus, it might be suggestedthat the Anglo-Italian Agreement should be denounced;or that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should be withdrawn;or that Great Britain should occupy Corfu.     As regardsthe latter point he had said that the Italians were certainly not going to threaten Greek independence, andthat any British occupation of Corfu would create themost dangerous reactions,,At this point the Foreign Secretary had interruptedSignor Crolla and had said that he could dismiss from his mind the idea that we had any intention of occupyingCorfu.     That was not the sort of action which we took;but that we should take a very grave view if any other country occupied it.The Foreign Secretary had also said that he wishedto leave Signor Crolla in no doubt that if the political
position of Albania was to be completely changed, thatwas a vital factor from the point of view of the Anglo-Italian Agreement and would be difficult to reconcile withthe assurances which had been given to us.     Signor Crollahad appeared somewhat sheepish under this interrogation,and had contented himself with saying that circumstances might have altered,      Signor Crolla had also referred toa report in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; as to the withdrawalof Italian troops from Spain, and had said that he had nodoubt that Signor Mussolini would keep the pledges givento us in this matter^     On this the Foreign secretary had made it clear that nothing would more assist those who wished to promote good relations between Italy and GreatBritain than that the pledges for the withdrawal of italian troops from Spain should be speedily and thoroughlycarried out.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that atllol5 a.m. on Sunday morning, 9th April, he had seen theGreek Minister, who had informed him of a report that italy proposed to occupy Corfu between the 10th and 12thApril.     He had added that Greece would resist anyItalian attack by force of arms and had enquired what attitude His Majesty&apos;s Government intended to adopt.The Foreign Secretary told him he would report the matter to his colleagues.     He had also told the Greek minister that Signor Crolla had informed him the previous night thatGreece and Yugoslavia were calm and had recounted the conversation which he had had with Signor Crolla inregard to Corfu.      He had added that he would take stepsto see what reply he could give to the Greek Government,but that it could be assumed that we should take a graveview of the matter.
At 11.30 aomc on Sunday, the Foreign secretary had had a second interview with Signor Crolla, who reported that the Duce, having read the account of the interview the previous night, was anxious to givethe Foreign Secretary information on the followingpoints.     First, that the occupation of Albaniawas taking place peacefully and with the enthusiasmof the population.    Second, that the future status of albania   would have a character conformingwith the juridical traditions of Rome.Third, that the Italian volunteers in Spain would be withdrawn after the military parade in Madrid,,      Fourth,that a crisis in Anglo-Italian relations would bedeplorableo      &quot;Lejeu Albanais ne vaut pas la ehandelle&quot;of the relations between Great Britain and Italy,He told Signor Crolla that he was grateful for this message and observed that, although he had been informed on the previous day by Signor Crolla that yugoslavia and Greece were calm, he now had information to theeffect that the Greek Government were very anxiousin view of reports now in circulation that the ItalianGovernment intended to occupy Corfu.      Signor Crollahad replied that it was the first time that he had heard a hint of such action and that, on his own responsibility, he would give an assurance that this wasnot Italy&apos;s intention,,     The Italian Government couldnot, however, allow Corfu, which was a vital strategicpoint, to be occupied by a foreign Power other thanGreece.     The Foreign Secretary had told the Charge
 affaires that he was glad of his personal assurance, &quot;butif Italian action against Gresrce of any sort were cp -concerntemplated, it would bra mattei* of the gravest/to HisMajesty&apos;s Government.      He (Signor Crolla) could assureCount Ciano that His Majesty&apos;s Government would do everything in their power to assist in maintaininggood relations between themselves and the ItalianGovernment.      He hoped that Signor Grolla would reportthis interview very fully to Rome in order that there might he no possibility of misunderstanding in thematter.The Greek Minister, who had again called atthe Foreign Office in the course of Sunday afternoon,had been seen by an official of the Foreign Officeand had been informed of the upshot of the secondinterview with Signor Crolla.     The Greek minister had said that he thought this could hardly be regardedas an answer to the Greek Governments request.      Hewas told to read between the lines of the answer,which should go a long way towards reassuring hisGovernment.     The point was that the Italian government now realised the full implications of any possibledesign on their part against Corfu,At 5.45 p.m. on Sunday, 9th April,  the foreign secretary had had a third interview with Signor Crolla,who had given him the following message from the Duce.First, all Italian volunteers would be withdrawn from spain immediately after the great parade which was totake place in Madrid.     Second, he had already givenample assurances to the Greek Government that italy would respect Greece&apos;s territorial and insularintegrity in the most absolute manner, and a message
to-this effect had heen sent to the Greek Government.Third, he appreciated the cordial attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government which would contribute to a furtherconsolidation of the ties between the two countries.The Foreign Secretary had asked Signor Crolla to thank the Duce for having acted so promptly in sending this message, which was a valuable contribution.     At the sametime, he had pointed out that strong feelings had beenaroused in this country by Italian action in Albania.Parliament was likely to meet next week and it would be most desirable that, if possible, an announcement should be made that the future status to be accorded toAlbania would conform with the assurances already given and be something which could reasonably be described as political independence.With the Prime Minister1s approval a telegram had also been sent to the French Government on Saturdayafternoon reporting the upshot of the conversation withSignor Crolla and asking whether the French Governmentwere prepared to adopt a similar attitude to ourselves        -if the Italians should make an attack on Corfu.The Foreign Secretary read out the terms of the reply tothis telegram which had been received, indicating thatthe French were prepared to adopt a similar attitude to ourselves (Telegram No. 155 from Paris).     He alsoread out a copy of a further telegram received from paris (No. 156), reporting the upshot of discussions which iM. Daladier had had with French Ministers, and, inparticular, with the Service Ministers,  indicating theirviews on a number of defence matters.      The FrenchGovernment seemed, perhaps, to take rather too exciteda view of the situation since it appeared unlikely that signor Mussolini had any intention of becoming .involvedin war with us at the present time.
The Foreign Secretary said that his mind was now moving on the lines of the suggestion made by theHome Secretary at the meeting of Ministers held on theprevious Saturday, namely,  that without waiting for afinal settlement of our arrangements with Rumania, weshould proceed independently to enter into agreements with Turkey and Greece0     He felt, however, that evenin the present troubled conditions, it was necessarynot to neglect altogether the possible effect of ouractions on Signor Mussolini&apos;s mindo     He thought thatthe Albanian adventure had been entered into mainly because Signor Mussolini wanted a cheap victory, although,of course, Albania constituted a possible base for afurther Italian advance into the Balkans0     He thoughtit was important that we should not act so as to driveItaly into greater reliance on Germany.,The Foreign Secretary indicated that he was Iexploring in his own mind the possibility that theaction, which we should table  in regard to Turkey and greece, should take some form other than the signature of non-aggression pactsD      Thus we might table  the line that, cinoe recent events showed how unsettled andanxious public opinion was in the Eastern Mediterranean,we desired to reinforce the clause in the Anglo-italian agreement which dealt with the maintenance of a status quo in the Mediterranean by rallying to thesupport of that principle such states as Turkey and greece.     He had it in mind that we might inform theItalian Government that we were taking this action, butthe position clearly required a lot of thinking out.As an example of the kind of difficulty which would requireto be dealt with in this matter, he pointed out, to take an extreme case, that it would be hopeless to expectGreece to come to our assistance if we were involved
in war as a result of an attack on Holland, but that turkey would almost certainly be prepared to.come toour support if we were involved in war in the EasternMedi terranean.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had come to theconclusion that the best way to make progress was on thelines of this country making unilateral declarations.This was what we had done in regard to Poland and asatisfactory agreement had resulted.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether we should not expect the countries concerned to afford help to eachother in the Mediterranean, to which the HOME SECRETARYreplied that he thought we should certainly obtain anysuch undertakings that were possible.      Tho main point was, however, in his view, that a unilateral declaration on our part would steady the situation.Some discussion then ensued whether we reallydesired that if war broke out Greece should join us or should remain neutral.     Reference was made to the recent report on this matter by the Chiefs of Staff (Paper No.iJ*0.S.8?3 (J.P.)), in which ihe view was expressed thatin view of her long northern frontier, v/e should prefer to have Greece as an assured neutral, i.e. with the certainty that she would not join our enemies, rather thanthat she should enter the war on our side*     In reachingthis view the Chiefs of Staff had, however, assumed thatwe should be able to make some use of Greek ports, eventhough Greece remained neutral.     It was also pointed outthat if an attack was to be made on Greece by, for example,Italy, we could not hope to be able to give any material assistance in Greece itself, but should hope to crushItaly in some other theatre.
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE thoughtit possible that the Dictators might intend to actalternately.      Italy, having achieved a coup in Albaniamight keep quiet for a time,  and the real menace mightbe what Germany would do next.      Ought we not to be considering with the other Powers what action we could take to concerting defensive measures with other Balkan Powers?THE HOME SECRETARY thought that we should get nothing done^by way of a general discussion withthe Balkan Powers and favoured the method of unilateral declaration.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he was in general agreement with the idea of makinga unilateral declaration in regard to Turkey and Greecewith the support of France.      This matter, however, couldnot be considered only on the political plane.      its economic aspect was of great importance.      Attempts hadbeen made to do something on the economic plane with turkey and Greece and,  in the last few days, with Bulgaria.    while he appreciated very fully the difficulties of the Chancellorof the Exchequer, he felt it was his duty to say clearly that if it was impossible to find money for the economicneeds of these countries, he was afraid that, whateverwe did in the political sphere,  we should find thesecountries fast slipping into the German orbit.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought thatthere was a much stronger case for doing something to helpBulgaria and Roumania than for helping Greece, which was unlikely to fall into the German orbit.   Germany, which
took 50 per cent,  of Bulgarian trade, was in a position,if she so desired, to starve that country into submission.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then read a copy of a telegram which had just been receivedfrom H.M. Ambassador at Rome (No.  304), regarding the interview that Lord Perth had had with Count Ciano who had just returned from Tirana.      This interview repeated the assurances which Signor Crolla had given in regard to theevacuation of Italian troops from Spain (including theBalearic Islands).      Lord Perth had made it clear to count Ciano how strongly public opinion in this country would react against the action which Italy had taken.It appeared that Italy was contemplating an arrangement withAlbania somewhat on the model of our Treaty with Egypt.In reply to a question,  the Foreign Secretaryexplained that at the present time Italy had no legalprotectorate over Albania.     Her interests in Albania had,however, been recognised by the Conference of Ambassadorsin 1921, and if it was necessary that order should be restored in Albania,  this task would probably have been entrusted to Italy by the Council of the League.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that if Greece was attacked by Italy we should have to treat this as a very serious matter which might result in this country going to war;   buthe wondered whether it was necessary to give definitepromises of assistance to such countries as Roumania and bulgaria and get nothing in return.      Further,  there was always the possibility that these countries might benegotiating behind our backs with Berlin.      If Poland was
prepared to join in the war if Roumania or Bulgariawere attached,  then Germany would he involved in a war on two fronts.      He asked what effective action wecould take to assist these countries in the absence ofany assurance of Polish support.THE SECRETARY CP STATE POR HOME AFFAIRS thoughtthat if, for example, we should in any event go towar if Italy was to attack Corfu, we should lose nothingand should obtain a definite advantage by saying so inadvance, since our declaration might prevent italy from making the attack, ^ ^kh^^ lk*.c*. a^^fl&apos; $Uy.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE urged theimportance of not concentrating too much on TurkeyIand Greece at the expense of Roumania.(the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS replied1that, with regard to Roumania, it had been decided that-Ithe first move must be made by Colonel Beck.In regard to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s point, hethought that,  if war came,  it would be a general war,and that if either Turkey or Greece were threatened,it would be impossible for us to stand aside.      Therewas,   therefore,  in his view,  everything to be said for defining our position clearly, since Signor mussolini had given too many hostages to fortune to be in aposition to contemplate a war with us with equanimity.As regards the Anglo-Italian Agreement, he thoughtthat we should express the strong views which we held as to Italy&apos;s action in Albania.      At the same time he was
most unwilling to see the Agreement denounced.      Wederived far more benefit from it than Italy, and we wishedin particular to see the Italian troops leave Spain.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought that a unilateral declaration by this country in favour of greece and Turkey would make it easier to defendacquiescence in what had happened in Albania.     A sharpdistinction could be drawn between Albania,  on the onehand, where Italian interests had long been recognised,and Greece and Turkey on the other hand.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thatpopular opinion,  although, no doubt, not well instructed,would certainly take the view that the Anglo-italian agreement was now almost valueless.      He thought thispoint of view could perhaps be met by saying that the actionwhich Italy had taken was a great shock to us, but thatthe question whether the Agreement- still had any validitydepended upon whether Italy removed her troops from Spain,-THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreedthat public opinion would take a strong line on thismatter, but he was nevertheless most anxious that theAgreement should not be denounced, and that we should notappear to distrust the assurances that Signor mussolini had given us over Spain.In this connection THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OFEDUCATION and THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that in their view it would be undesirable, when making the proposedunilateral declarations as to Greece and Turkey, to refer to the,clause in the Anglo-Italian Agreement dealing withthe stat\xs quo in the Mediterranean.    They thought that reference to the Agreement in this connection would do more harm than good.
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE thoughtthat the threat of an attach by Germany on Roumania wasthe greatest danger which confronted us,    We should nowbe considering what action we should take in such an event,and how we should prepare ourselves to meet it in con-junction with the other countries concerned.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that thelogical deduction from this would be that any declarationregarding interference with the status quo by force wouldresult in Great Britain and France declaring war on germany.      This compelled consideration of the conditionof our own forces, and our defence preparations.      Hesaid that in the present case he would have liked to have seen British ships go into the Ionian Sea.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND agreed withthe view of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.He thought that it was Herr hitler mentality which would decide when the main attack would take place.    If wewere now to make a declaration as to Greece and Turkeythere was a risk that this might induce Herr Hitlerto strike at Yugoslavia or Roumania, the two countries.likely to be threatened,  in regard to which nodeclaration had been made.    He wondered whether it would bepossible to avoid this by adopting an alternative course.      He had in mind that,  instead of making a formaldeclaration, the Foreign Secretary should announceperhaps by a statement in Parliament, the upshot of the conversations which he had had with the representativesof foreign States.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that this point was worth considering.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER   suggested-14-
that the proposed declarations in regard to Turkey and greece might he founded simply on our desire to mitigate the state of unrest in the Mediterranean,Such action would he in keeping with our position as a mediterranean Power.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he doubted whetherthe Cabinet could carry the discussion any further that day.     He suggested that the Foreign Policy Committeeshould meet and discuss the two main points which had arisen that morning,  namely:-(1) What steps should be taken to reassure the Mediterranean countries as to their position.(2) What steps should be taken to securethe position against further aggression by Germany0In regard to the second point, it was clear thatit was unlikely that we could prevent Roumania being over-run if attacked.     We could, however, make itclear that if she was attacked we should declare war on germany and. that might act as a deterrent.     We had,however, always contemplated that any assistance from usto Roumania should be dependent upon action by Poland,which would ensure a war on two fronts.     It was alittle difficult to see how we could take any effective action without Poland&apos;s help.      He suggested, and theCabinet agreed, that the Foreign Policy Committeeshould be asked to consider the matter and report to afurther Meeting of the Cabinet.In reply to a question, the Prime minister  explained that he did not intend that the discussion by the Foreign Policy Committee should be rigidlylimited to the two points which he had summarised above.
There was no objection to the Foreign Policy Committeeconsidering the position of Hungary or Denmark.The Cabinet agreed to the course proposed bythe Prime Minister, and a Meeting of the ForeignPolicy Committee was arranged to be held at 4 p.m.that day.
2.    THE jjij5xs.IER FOR CJO-QRDUSUTID1T SF-DEEEITOE-^xplaiJied -that he had presided. the previous afternoon.,over a -meeting attended-by &quot;the Foreign- Secretary and himself, and the three Chiefs of Staff or their Deputies^The main-point at issue had been to ensure that-we -should.not he caught unawares in.the Mediterranean,. .,JJe-explained in detail the position of the mediterranean fleet-, which was, at present, - somewhat, scattered.., -ami,said that,, with the approval of the First Lord, orders had been sent to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean),giving him a general appreciation of the situatioJX-anxiordering him to concentrate units of the Fleet,,otherthan those now at Malta, at an appropriate rendezvousto the south of that Island.Three questions were-now outstanding in regardto the Fleet.(a) Whether ships at present at. Malta.-should leave the island -and- join the rest of the Fleet attheir--r endezvous.(b) Whether two cruisers and a division of destroyers, which were earmarked for the defence of. the suez. Canal,, should leave Malta .for.. Alexandria.(c) Whether the French should be -in oj?iaed^of--the&apos;action we proposed to take in regard to the Fleet.In. discussion, it was explained that, to remove from Malta the ships at present in harbour there or to concentrate the Fleet at Malta before the pre-arrangeddate   would be likely to give rise to some comment.     Onthe., other hand, it was not thought-that the - despatch oftwo cruisers and a few destroyers towards the..middle ofthe. week, for the defence of the Canal would give rise .to any comment.
-after some discussion the Cabinet agreed -To authorise the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary, inconsultation with the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence andthe First Lord of the Admiralty,to settle the further movements of the Mediterranean Fleet.&quot;troops in Egypt THE SECRETARY OF ST^TS FOR VA-R said that threej Palestine-days ago he had given instructions that a plan shouldbe prepared for the return from Palestine of the unitsnormally located in Egypt which had been lent to palestine.      The General Staff were convinced that themilitary risk in Egypt was far greater than inPalestine.     They were anxious for the immediate returnto Egypt of the units on loan to Palestine, whichcomprised one armoured car regiment, one batterjr of artillery and two battalions of infantry.     The GeneralStaff -also-wislv9d...ths. Middle Sast and Reserve Brigadeto move from Palestine to Egypt, but he thought -fciiat adecision on this point might be postponed.TEE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS (inthe absence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies)said that the High Coanissioner and the General OfficerCommanding, who had been consulted by telegram, bothagreed in thinking that the present was a mostinopportune moment to move these troops.     They pointed36 NOTE.At a Meeting held later in the afternoon it wasdecided - n^w(a) That the Mediterranean Fleet should/rendezvousat Malta.(b) That two Cruisers and a division of Destroyersshould leave Malta for Alexandria:(c) That the French should be informed, through,the Naval AttachS, of our Fleet movements inthe Mediterranean, and that an appropriatemessage should be sent to quieten theapprehensions which the French government appeared to entertain in regard to suggestions that we intended to send a Fleet to theFar East.
out that it would, he most inopportune that this movementshould table  place just before the declaration of Govern-ment policy was due to be made,THE MINISTER FOE CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEemphasised that the Chief of the Imperial General staff was satisfied that if the troops were withdrawn hecould hold the position in Palestine without any serious risk.      The position in Egypt, however, was insecure untilthe troops returned.In the course of further discussion, the PRiMEMINISTER pointed out that one alternative to acceleratingthe announcement of the Governments policy would be to delay it, a course which he understood had been advocated by the Chiefs of Staff,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that if we couldbelieve the assurances given to us, the position to-daywas a good deal easier and it might therefore be argued that the Colonial Office view should be deferred to.Against this, however, must be set the public anxietyin Egypt and the strong French feeling that our positionin Egypt was we alia      On balance,  therefore, he was infavour of the immediate return to Egypt of the troopsloaned, to Palestine? viz. two infantry battalions, one armoured car regiment, one battery of artillery.THE PRIME MINISTER concurred with this view.THE CABINET agreed -That orders should be issued for theimmediate return to Egypt of thetroops loaned from Egypt to Palestineas set out above.
i AiriTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR ,/AR said that,,in view of information which had been received from our Consul at Benghazi as to the concentration of italian troops in Tripoli, the General Officer commanding in egypt wished to move certain troops to Ivlersa Matruh,No decision on this point was reached by theCabinet, but in a discussion between the Prime Minister,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for War after the Meeting, theSecretary of State for War was authorised to issue instructions to the effect that the troops in question should be in readiness to move, but should not moveuntil further orders were issuedcIt was explained that of the three Royal AirForce Squadrons now in Palestine one was part of theordinary Egyptian force and two were designated for egypt as part of the plan for the defence of thatcountry*     It was explained, however, that these squadrons could move at short notice, and it was agreedthat there was no need for further discussions to takeplace with the Authorities in Palestine on this matter at the present time

Arising out of the discussion on theprevious conclusions as to the return to EgyptOf the troops loaned to Palestine, THE Secretary Of STATE POR DOMINION AFFAIRS asked what action should he taken in regard to the suggestion thatthe announcement of Government policy in regard to palestine might he postponed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the HighCommissioner in Palestine should he informed that,if he thought that, in view of all the circumstances,including the recall of the troops now on loan from egypt, it was desirable that the Government should postpone an announcement of their policy in regard to palestine, the Government were ready to consider such a suggestion.-2t/..-
jjj&amp;lFESS TO\xjr SUDDENrIR ATTACK.(previous reference:Cabinet l4,(o9;Conclusion 3;.4.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had given further consideration to the position of this country-to meet the threat of sudden air attack.      It v/asclear that we were not in a position to meet suchan attack until IS hours had elapsed after thedeclaration of an emergency.      There was the furtherpoint that, while our Fighter Aircraft were ready totake the air at any time if an emergency were to arise, there would he no searchlights to assist them,with the result that the Fighters could not operate effectively at night.     Nevertheless, it was at nightthat a surprise attack would he most likely to takeplace.      This position was most unsatisfactory, and hethought that the Secretary of State for War should he asked to investigate some alternative method of ensuring that at any rate the searchlights could hemanned every night.     No doubt the obvious way to dealwith this matter would be to entrust a considerable partof our A. A. defence to Regular Troops.     It was clear,however, it would take a long time to enlist and trainRegular Troops.     He thought, therefore, that immediate steps should be taken to see whether the matter couldnot be dealt with by some interim ad hoc arrangement.He was not satisfied that the possibilities of voluntary service on the part of Territorials had been exhausted,and he would be glad if the Secretary of State for war would be good enough to examine the whole matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR explained thelegal position and said that, &quot;while he could, of course,invite Territorial Officers and men to undertake specialduty, there was no certainty that he could secure the requisite response or the requisite number of.specialists.     Further, most Territorials could not
combine their civil vocations with the type of duty nowproposed.     Nevertheless, in spite of these difficulties,and although it would make the matter very difficult todeal with on a satisfactory basis, he would undertake toexamine the matter again, and he would do his best tomeet the Prime Minister1s views.In the course of discussion,   THE MINISTER FORCO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE referred to the possibility that caretakers or retired personnel might be employed to,stand by the searchlights during the day, and it wassuggested that one useful method of procedure would befor the matter to be discussed with the TerritorialCoiTimanders in order that it might be explored on thebasis of what could be done in particular units.THE CABINET agreed -To invite the Secretary of State for war to consider what arrangements could bemade so as to ensure the continuousmanning of a proportion at least of thesearchlights of the A.D.G-.B.   (and, ifpossible, also a proportion of the guns)during, say, the next three to six months,as an interim arrangement.
ASLIAMBNT.eoall of.&apos;Previous&apos;reference:cabinet 15(39)inclusion 1),5.      THE PRIME MINISTER reported that he hadreceived a request on Saturday, 8th April, from the leader of the Labour Opposition, asking that parliament should be summoned at the earliest opportunity.      if parliament was recalled, there would no doubt bea good deal of hard speaking about the Dictators, whichwas unlikely to make the international situation anyeasier.     At the same time it was difficult to refuse the request that Parliament should be recalled beforethe date arranged, namely Tuesday, 18th April/ and begiven the best information which the Government had at their disposal and an opportunity to discuss thematter.General agreement was expressed with this view.A discussion then took place as to the date onwhich Parliament should be recalled;    the alternativesbeing Wednesday, 12th, Thursday, 13th, and Monday,17th April.     If Parliament was recalled on Wednesday,12th, there was a likelihood that the debate would lastat least two days.     While there would be advantages in deferring the summons of Parliament until Monday,17th, it was felt that, if justification existed forthe earlier recall of Parliament, the recalling one day earlier would not really meet the situation.General preference was therefore expressed for therecalling of Parliament on Thursday, 13th April.THE CABINET agreed -to authorise the Prime Minister tosettle the date for the recall ofParliament in consultation with the leader of the Labour Opposition, inthe light of the above discussion.fNOTE.    It was later arranged that parliament should meet on Thursday,13 th AprilJ7.
