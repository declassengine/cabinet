THE suez canal.Defence of.(previous reference:Cabinet 15(39), Con-elusion 3 ,)1. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs referred to the Conclusion noted in the margin, whenhe had been authorised to invite the Egyptian Govern-ment to take the necessary steps for the immediatemounting of certain guns near Port Said and Suezfor the defence of the Suez Canal.    He thought hiscolleagues would like to   know that this work had now been completed.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
THB INTER-jf AT TONALSITUATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 20(39), Con-elusion 1.)Poland,Poland, and roumania *The soviet union.F.R.ZLr (2q)l.2, THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs reported that the Polish Government had agreed togive us an assurance   of- assistance in the event ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government heing involved in war withGermany in defence of the smaller yes tern Powers(Telegram No. 110 from Warsaw) ,In reply to the Prime Minister, the Foreign Seere-tary said, he thought that this phrase included.Denmark,The Polish Government had also asked for staff conversations.    This matter was under considerationby the Chiefs of Staff.The Polish and Roumanian Foreign Ministers had met in the train which carried the latter throughPoland to Berlin,    The Roumanian Government had.proposed to the Polish Government that the latter should bind themselves to support Roumania if thatcountry were attacked by Germany (Telegram No. 114from Warsaw) ,    Colonel Beck&apos;s reaction to this approach was not yet known, but was unlikely to be favourable.The Soviet Amba.ssa.dor had. informed the Secretaryof State tha.t the Soviet Government were prepared totake part in giving assistance to Roumania.    TheSoviet Government had asked our views as to how helpshould be given (Telegram No, 70    to   Moscow).    our suggestion ha^ been that the Soviet Government shouldmake a declaration offering assistance, if desired,to any European neighbours of the Soviet Union(Telegram 71    to  Moscow).    The Soviet Governmentreply to this suggestion had. been to propose a comprehensive European plan o^&apos; mutual assistance and Staff Conversations between Great Britain, Franceand Soviet Russia, and assurances to Russia&apos;s  Vesternneighbours (mel.eera-* No. 69 from Moscow).
THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Soviet ForeignMinister appeared to have given our Ambassador at Moscowa false account ef the Foreign Secretary&apos;s interview with M. Maisky e.    The Russian Foreign Minister had said that M. Maisky had tolci the Foreign secretary that the Soviet were prepared, to give help to roumania on condition that, we implemented ourassurance to Roumania, and that the Foreign secretary had replied to thi? suggestion by a.sking Russia to35make a. unilateral r1 eclara.tion.    In fact, however,M. Maisky, in informing the Foreign Secretary thatthe Soviet Government were prepared, to take part in giving assistance to Roumania, had made no suchcondition.THE SECRETARY OF STAm^] FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSconfirmed that this was so.   M. Maisky had begun by saying that he had been instructed by his Governmentto say that they woul^ help Roumania.   He had. replied,that this was good ne^s, since we were ahout to ask the Soviet Government whether they would be prepared,to elve help to Roumania and Poland.The Foreign Secretary undertook to clear up thispoint as quickly as possible.The Foreign Secretary added that he thought it-would be necessary to exercise considerable cautionin the answer to be sent to the Soviet Government,and. he propose^ that this matter should be considered  -by the Foreign Policy Committee.This course was agreed to.Turkey. ^he Foreign Secretary said that the reply givenby the Turkish Government to the approach which we-3-x      (Telegram 68 from Moscow)
had ma.de to them was somewhat confused and revealeda number of inconsistencies.    Thus, it was  clearthat Turkey wished to avoid (a.) provoking the hostilityof the Berlin-Rome Axis, -(b) alienating Bulgaria&quot;,and ( c) wished to &quot;he sure precisely what assistance would be available to her.      The Turkish government proposed, first, that a public statement of a somewhatvague character should be made.   His own view wasthat this statement should be made somewhat more precise.    Secondly, that, a secret understanding shouldbe entered into between the two countries, givingwider assurances of assistance.     Thirdly, thatStaff Conversations should take place between thetwo countries.    This last point was under considera-tion ^y the Chiefs of Staff.The Foreign Secretary sai^ that a draft reply had been prepared, and he suggested that this matter might also be considered by the Foreign PolicyCommittee that afternoon.This course was agreed to *Bulgaria. The Turkish Government, with our approval, wereactively seeking to promote an agreement betweenBulgaria and Roumania,    The suggestion was, first,that Bulgaria should join the Balkan Entente&quot;secondly, that the Dobrudja question should, beconsidered after a stated interval;    thirdly, thata Balkan bloc should be formed to resist german pressure (telegrams Nos . 121 and 1S6 from Angora).It was too early to say what prospect there wa.s that
this-move -would be successful.    Our Minister atSofia took a grave view of the position unless somesettlement could be reached of the Dobrudja question^But it should be remembered that,so soon as theDobrudja question was openly raised, there was apossibility that the Transylvania question would beraised by Hungary, which might result in a eonflagra-tion.    It-was much better that the Turks, who werethe architects of ^he Balkan Entente, should raise this matter in the first instance rather than thatwe should do so.      We had lent our support to theTurkish demarche in this matter.Danzig. Our Charge d&apos;Affaires at Berlin had recentlyFR2b (^tf) $       received a report that, failing an amicable agreementwith Poland, the German Government were planning an internal revolt in Danzig, to be followed by german military occupation.   We had asked Colonel Beckwhether he had. any information ^ihich bore out thisreport, and what credence he attached to it.    It had also been suggested to the Polish Government that ifthere was the least likelihood of the GermanGovernment planning a coup-de-main. and. if thePolish Government, were in fact prepared to treatwith Germany for a settlement of the Danzig question,it might be well if they could cut the ground, fromunder the feet of thP German Government by showingtheir disposition to negotiate.    It was understood from other sources that the Poles were not apprehen-sive of any immediate development in Danzig.
At a lerfro-r Btago in the meeting)! THE FQiKB9i9MAt a later stage in the Meeting, THE foreign secretary reported that he had now received a telegramfrom Berlin in regard to relations between Germany and poland,     In effect, the upshot of the report was that herr Hitler was now dealing with these negotiationshimself, but that not much progress was being made.This was attributed to the fact that the Poles were adopting a more intractable attitude since they had obtained our guarantee.     It was not expected that therewould be any surprise in regard to Danzig beforeHerr Hitler&apos;s birthday, but events were apparentlyexpected in the first fortnight in May.The Cabinet took note of the statement,and agreed that the replies to bo fph-isent to the Soviet Government and to ;     /JxVj Turkey should be discussed at a meetingof the Foreign Policy Committee to beheld at 5.30 p.m. that afternoon.
3131GERMANY. 3.      THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that the question had arisen JProposedmessage whether our Charge d&apos;Affaires in Berlin shouldfrom the king to Herr Hitler subscribe to the birthday present to Herr Hitler Ion his fiftiethbirthday. which had been organised by a certain memberof the Diplomatic Corps in Berlin.    The jjdecision which had been finally taken on thismatter had been that our Charge d&apos;Affairesshould not subscribe, provided that the ambassadors of France and the United Statesdecided to adopt a similar attitude.    In theevent, the representatives of Great Britain,France, the United States and Russia had decided not to subscribe.The question whether The King should      [ifsend a birthday message to Herr Hitler fell,&apos;&apos; ;; S    ;,.Av however, to be decided on different grounds.The proposal that the Diplomatic representatives should combine in giving a birthday present tothe head of the German Reich was withoutprecedent.    On the other hand,  it was thenormal practice for The King to send birthdaymessages to the heads of a number of States.(The full list is set out in Appendix A tothese conclusions.)    Further, we could notalign ourselves with France and America in thismatter,  since it was not customary for thePresident of the French Republic or thePresident of the United States to send birthdaymessages to the heads of other States.    Subject-Ito the views of his colleagues, he thought that\one very important consideration was theprobable effect on Herr Hitler of the discontinuance of the normal birthday message,which he might well regard as a deliberate affront,;-7-
3 iJ 0At the same time, care must he taken to avoid actionwhich would expose The King to criticism.    On thewhole, he thought that the right course would heto send a message, not in the customary form which contained wishes for the recipient&apos;s health and welfare, hut as follows.;; -&quot;Please accept Herr Reichschancellormy congratulations on your fiftieth&quot;birthday.&quot;In the course of discussion,  it was explained that no official invitations had been sentto this country to attend Herr Hitler&apos;s birthdaycelebrations.    Two invitations had been sent to individuals - General Puller and Lord Brocket - andit was understood that Herr Hitler had followed asimilar line in regard to other countries.The view generally expressed in discussion was if the investigation showed that birthday greetingswere regularly sent by The King to the heads of anumber of States, the right course was that, notwith-ssanding a certain reluctance to any message being sent,His Majesty should on the present occasion be advised to send a message on the lines suggested by thePoreign Secretary.Note:    After the conclusion of the meeting,it was decided,  in view of the particulars set out in Appendix A,to these conclusions, that theSecretary of State for Poreign affairs should advise the King in favour of sending a birthday message to herr hitler in the terms suggested byhim at the meeting.Return of As regards the return of H.M. Ambassador with.M.Ambassador     Berlin, the Poreign Secretary reminded his colleagues to Berlin.that just before Easter he had informed them that it(previous reference:       was proposed that Sir Nevile Henderson should returnCabinet 18(39)Conclusion 3.)   to Berlin shortly after Easter.    Events had then -happened which -made some postponement of this
arrangement necessary, and lie had thought it v/asbetter that Sir Nevile Henderson should not return until after the Fuhrer&apos;s birthday celebrations.    A statement had been inserted in the Press to the effect that sir Nevile had taken a short period of leave after making his report.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
AiaANIA. 4c THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSRecognition        referred to telegram No. 205 to Rome informing theof Italianaction. Earl of Perth that Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s credentials as(Previous Ambassador designate had been signed on the 28th March.Reference:Cabinet 20(39) We were anxious that there should be no question of theConclusion 2.Italian Government refusing to accept these credentialsalthough they contained no reference to the King ofItaly1s title as King of Albania.      On the other hand,it was out of the question at the moment that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should take any action involvingformal recognition of Italy1s title to Albania.      Hehad therefore asked Lord Perth to explain the positionfrankly to Count Ciano and to state that we were anxious not to enter into controversy at the moment and he hoped that the Italian Government would acceptSir Percy Loraine&apos;s credentials on the ground that theyhad already been signed before recent events took place.If the Italian Government refused to accept the presentcredentials, it would mean that the arrival ofLord Perth&apos;s successor would have to be postponed.The Foreign Secretary added that he hoped thatif the Italian troops left Spain within a short time,it would be possible to recognise Italy, at any rate, asthe de facto ruler of Albania.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
ALLEGED italian and GERMANACTIVITIES in spain.5.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR POREIGNAPPAIRS said, that there had recently been anumber of conflicting rumours about Italian andGerman activities in Spain.    It had been alleged:-Firstly, that large bodies of italian troops had arrived at Cadiz in the first weeks ofApril.    It v/as true that about 2,500 italian troops had landed at Cadiz between the 22nd and25th March,  i.e,  just before the fall of Madrid.It had also been ascertained that before the fall of Madrid it had been the Italian intention tosend a further 6,000 fresh troops, and there hadbeen many reports that further consignments had,in fact, been sent after the 2,500 mentionedabove.    No positive confirmation, however, had beenobtained, and there was no evidence at all that large numbers of Italians had landed at thebeginning of April.Secondly,  it was rumoured that the alleged Italian reinforcements had proceeded tothe Pyrenees and to the Portuguese frontier.All the information tended to show that theItalians were concentrated in the Albacete-Alicante area in southern Spain, with theexception of one regiment which was north ofMadrid.    There was,  in fact, no reason tobelieve that Italian troops were threateningthe Portuguese or French frontiers, and it looked as though they were preparing to return home.
Thirdly, there was the allegation thatthe Germans were constructing a network of aerodromes and fortifications along the Pyrenees.    There was no evidence for this allegation:    in fact a delegation of Prench Military Correspondent, mostly Generalsof Reserve, had toured the Spanish side of thePyrenees at General Franco&apos;s invitation in February .and had found no evidence of fortifications.    It seemed unlikely that any  substantial wprks could have-been undertaken in the meantime.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that it would be seen that these rumours were for the most part either contradictory or vagueand were unsupported by evidence.    He pointed outthat Lord Perth in a telegram of the 6th Aprilreported that the Spanish Embassy in Rome, when asked about reports that additional volunteers had recently been sent to Spain, had replied that therehad been reinforcements or replacements, and,though the Spaniards had not wanted them, theycould do nothing about them.    This reply, however,might well refer to the 2,500 Italians who had landed at Cadiz between the 22nd and 25th March.Unless large numbers of Italians had been sentafter the fall of Madrid on March 28th, thisadmission of the Spanish Government was not ofspecial significance.Information from other sources indicated that the Italians were making active preparations for withdrawal and that about 500 at least hadalready left Spain, although these preparationshad been somewhat hampered by Italy&apos;s preoccupationwith Albania.The Cabinet took note of this statement.-12-
RETURN OF 6.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSMOORISH troops to SPANISH said that the Spanish High Commissioner at TetuanTERRITORY.Position atTangier and gibraltar.had stated on April 13th that the troops senthack to Spanish Morocco represented there patriation of personnel employed in Spain duringthe Civil War, and that at least half of them had been ,disbanded.    He had assured Mr. Keeling,our Minister at Tangier, that there was no truth in the report of an impending occupation ofTangier.On April 14th Mr. Keeling had reportedthat the Spanish High Commissioner at Tetuan hadtelephoned&apos;to deny the press rumours of the arrival of ,Italian troops in the Spanish zone.Arrangements were being made in response to an invitation from the Spanish High Commissionerfor a British Officer from Gibraltar to verifythis statement.The Foreign Secretary thought that thereturn of Moorish troops to Morocco was a verynatural step for the Spanisli Government to take.In reply to a question by the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that there had been numerousreports of military movements which at one timeled to a consensus of view that an attack onGibraltar by land was being planned.THE /SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR saidthat there were reports that troops and tanks were concentrated at La Linea,and that it had been thought right to treat this threat seriously.    a
number of precautions had therefore been taken,including the manning of the anti-aircraft guns.Two battalions of infantry which were on. their wayto Palestine would be detained at Gibraltar untilthe arrival of   a   battalion of the Welsh Guardswhich was shortly leaving this country for Gibraltar.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that it seemed that these reports probablyarose out of the arrangements made in connectionwith the embarkation at Algeciras of troopsreturning to Spanish Morocco, or from the arrangementsfor a Military Parade at Seville on the occasion ofGeneral Franco&apos;s entry into that city on 16th April.The Portuguese Ambassador had also told him that hehad been informed of these troop movements by theSpanish Government, which were due in part todemobilisation and in part to the movements with aview to the rounding up of communists.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies said that he was not altogether satisfied as to thearrangements at Gibraltar for the air defence of civilians.    Until recently the Colonial Office hadbeen advised that the galleries in the rock.would afford protection to 12,000 civilians.    The presentGovernor thought that the galleries would not affordadequate protection, mainly on the grounds that thetime available would not enable the civilian population to reach the galleries.    Authority had therefore been given to start borings in the rocknear to the town, but these new arrangements wouldtake some time to complete.    Apart from distance,some questions had been raised as to the suitability of the galleries as air raid shelters on technical grounds.The Cabinet took note of these statements.- 14 -
0OSRELATION ?oiOW SITUATION.iWnet 19 (39)7.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to certain rumours recently receivedfrom our Ambassador at Rome which were of adisquieting nature.     A telegram had been receivedfour days ago regarding the calling up of italian fleet reserves-     There were also rumours ofGerman troops passing through Italy.     He wastrying to obtain confirmation of these reports.The French were also apprehensive about the visit of the German Fleet to Spanish waters*     Hethought that our first reaction to this had beenthat, on balance, the Admiralty did not regard the visit as alarming,.     Information received fromother intelligence sources, however, pointed to thefact that the position might be becoming critical.The Foreign Secretary said that while he found it impossible to check the value of these reports, he thought that we should satisfy ourselvesthat our state of readiness was as well advancedas was practicable,     He asked the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence and the Service Ministerswhether they had any suggestions to make.     Inparticular, he was rather perturbed as to the visit of H.M.S. Repulse to Canada,      He also thought that consideration might be given to the question whether some Standing Committee should be set up which mightshare with him the responsibility for examining theinformation received regarding developments in theinternational situation.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said theAdmiralty still took the view that on balance the visit of the German Fleet to Spain was not
disturbing.     This Admiralty view turned, in part,on the composition of the German Fleet, whichcomprised not merely the three Deutschlands and submarines, but also destroyers and cruisers.He thought there might be some advantage in H.M.S.Repulse being on the other side of the Atlantic.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that while other countries frequently tookmeasures of mobilisation or partial mobilisation,such measures, if taken in this country, were apt to lead to alarm.     He agreed, however, that we oughtto consider whether further precautionary steps should not now be taken,,     The Home Fleet was atpresent laid up and taking leave.     The foreign secretary,^the First Lord 5sad he had agreed that itwas right that the Home Fleet should take leave at thepresent time.     It also had to be remembered that many of the ships in our Fleet were relatively oldand must spend a certain amount of time undergoingminor repairs.     The leave of the Fleet would finishin about a week&apos;s time (27th) and he thought that inviewof the date of the Reichstag meeting (28th), he had not thought it necessary to suggest cutting short the periodof leave.TheJVlinister for Co-ordination of Defencee^sfe&amp;iri&amp;ea that the boom defences had been laidat Gibraltar, but not at Malta, and that the boomdefences at Scapa and Rosyth could be laid in 48hours, i.e., before the Fleet,  if ordered North,would reach Scapa or Rosyth.7
The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff had informed him that he had received messages fromthe Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and theCommander-in-Chief, Plymouth, to the effect that,while precautions were being taken in H.M. Ships,neither the Military nor the Air Force Commanders hadreceived any similar warning.     He (the Minister)thought that the measures which had been taken about ten days ago, after consideration by the StrategicalAppreciation Committee, had had one result that hehad not foreseen;   namely, that they had led to thefeeling that, while the Government were themselvesalarmed about the position, adequate precautionarysteps were not being taken.     He had asked theChiefs of Staff to consider the matter from thispoint of view that afternoon.The communication from the Deputy Chief of theNaval Staff also pointed to some lack of co-ordination.Steps had now been taken to set this right, and atelegram had been sent to the Governors of Malta,Gibraltar, Aden and Sierra Leone informing them ofthe basis on which measures were being taken in thiscountry, and instructing them to take such measures as they thought fit to meet a completely unheraldedattack, on the same basis as the precautions taken here.These latter, however, contained a proviso that themeasures taken should not cause publicity.     Hethought that this might prevent any effective measuresbeing taken.     He attached importance to our allowingour defence measures to become known, thus gettingpeople accustomed to seeing precautionary measures taken without becoming alarmed.- 17 -
The Minister thought that, while it was probablyundesirable     to mobilise the Fleet, since this was a stepusually only taken when war was imminent,  the Fleet could begot into a state of greater preparedness, and that we should consider whether there was any counter which we -could make tothe visit of the German Fleet to Spain.      Strategically this move was not, perhaps, disadvantageous to us.      He thought,however, that the Germans would probably use the occasion to train the Spaniards to work with them, and perhaps to make arrangements for German ships to operate from Spanish waters.In regard to our Naval position generally, so long as bothH.M.S. HOOD and H.M.S. RENOWN were laid up, he felt thatthere was a certain risk in H.M.S. REPULSE, our onlyremaining Battle Cruiser&apos;, going to Canada.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR gave particulars of the extent to which our garrisons overseas were understrength.      In particular, we were short of artillerymen inthe Mediterranean.   He thought that consideration should begiven to the question whether measures of partial or half-mobilisation should not be adopted immediately in the Army,The General Staff was strongly of opinion that this should bedone.     Virtually all other nations in Europe had now takensubstantial measures of mobilisation.      It was only bymobilising reserves that we could provide the artillerypersonnel required.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE agreed thatthe mobilisation of the Army was more urgent than the mobilisation of the Fleet, in present circumstances.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we were now back in thesame position in regard to the air defence of Great Britainthat we had been in before the Regular Anti-Aircraft unitshad been brought from Lichfield to London.    Under present
arrangements it would &quot;be impossible for us to man the guns and searchlights without a Proclamation declaring anemergency, and the process of manning the lights and gunswould take 12 hours.      In the meantime we were virtuallywithout defence against air attack, with the exception of the fighter aircraft which, in the absence of searchlights, could operate by day only and not by night.     He invited theSecretary of State for War, who had been investigating thismatter, to explain the position to the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY of STATE for WAR said that theposition had been very thoroughly examined, and with every&quot;desire to find some measures which-^ould enable us to meetthe threat of sudden air attack by voluntary effort.   among those consulted had been Territorial Officers, representativeemployers, and Lord Derby, the Chairman of the Council ofthe Territorial Association.      The universal opinion hadbeen that it was impossible to work a voluntary system withina voluntary system.     Unless an emergency existed, it wouldbe an intolerable burden on Tei*ritorial officers and men tobe called upon to serve whole-time for indefinite periods.It was impossible to combine the duties in question withcivilian work, more particularly in the case of the search-lights, which were situated at considerable distances fromthe headquarters of the units.Arrangements had been made whereby 96 searchlightsin the London area could be manned at very short notice,but these lights were within the inner artillery zone andwere intended for co-operation with anti-aircraft guns, andnot with fighters.a scheme had been prepared for a permanent nucleus of defence against high-altitude attack, which would require,in round figures, 1,000 officers and 26,000 other ranks.    Of
*^ 9 *)0 0 hthese, 500 officers and 14,500 men were required by thesearchlights alone.      The War Office took the view that itwould be unwise to man the searchlights only, since attack by day was more likely than by night.     The Secretary ofState for Air demurred to this view.Continuing, the Secretary of State for War said thatthe defence system was a coherent whole, and that all theintegral parts of it should be manned,  including the balloonbarrage and the Observer Corps.     He thought that an attemptto obtain the necesso.ry personnel by voluntary methods would fail and would deal a shattering blow to the system.     Theconclusion reached was that the only satisfactory method ofproviding a permanent nucleus for defence against air attack was to man that nucleus with Regulars.      The proposal putforward was, therefore,  first, to declare an emergency and call out the A.A. units of the Territorial Army to man thedefence during the next few months:    secondly, to create a regular force by calling out Reservists, who could be trainedto man the searchlights and guns in three months&apos; time.    This,however, was only a temporary arrangement, and he saw no meansof obtaining the number of additional Regulars required fora permanent arrangement, except by some system of compulsory service.     It was suggested, therefore that some form ofICompulsory       compulsory service should be introduced, and that the menService.called up should serve for one year.      He thought that         &apos; the men obtained by this means could be adequately trained insix months.     This system would, therefore, always give a nucleus of men who would have completed six months&apos;  training and would be capable of manning the guns and searchlights.
*i 6 aTHE MINISTER POR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat it was generally agreed the present position was most unsatisfactory.    It was clear that the only immediatemeans of meeting the situation would he to call outforthwith the territorial personnel who had undertakenan obligation to serve in time of war..   He thought thatit was very difficult to justify an arrangement wherebythose who had volunteered to serve in war would becalled upon to man guns and searchlights in time ofpeace, while others who had not undertaken this voluntaryobligation continued with their ordinary occupations.He also doubted whether the present system resultedin our using the best material in the best way, orgave us the results which we required..   He thought thatit should be considered whether we should be justifiedin introducing compulsory service in order to meet theneeds of the air defence of Great Britain, or whetherthis was employing a sledge hammer to crack a nut.   Sofar as he had been able to ascertain, the War Office was.the only Department which appeared likely to deriveany immediate benefit from a system of compulsory service.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the matter whichwas now being considered was one of far-reachingimportance and his colleagues must realise that mattersof this kind could not be lightly undertaken, or without due preparation.    It was true that there was more and more pressure from France and other countriesabroad for the adoption by this country of compulsory
military servicec    As against this, it was necessaryto realise the strong feeling against compulsion inthe Trades Union movement, particularly among theleaders of that movemento    Any rash or sudden decision without proper preparation would he likely to cause a violent reaction which would interfere with the rearmament programme *.    If this happened, the effectabroad would be the opposite to what the supporters, ofthe scheme anticipatedoThe Prime Minister added that he had been giving a good deal of thought to this matter and would liketo take an opportunity of discussing it with theMinisters specially concerned.    He agreed that adecision upon it was required as soon as possible, andif he was in a position to do so, he would submit someproposal to the special meeting of the Cabinet which hadbeen arranged for 5 p.mc on Monday, the 24th April, to hear the Chancellor of the B:thequer&apos;s Budget proposals-.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he was greatly impressed with the opinions on thissubject expressed in foreign countries    He thought thatif the decision on this matter was limited to compulsoyservice   for the air defence of Great Britain, theresults would be unfortunate on public opinion.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR thought the general council of the Trades Union Congress would be likely toexperience trouble in the matter with the NationalUnion of Railwaymen and. the Amalgamated engineering union.-
The Cabinet took note(l)   That the Prime Minister proposed togive consideration, in consultationwith certain of his colleagues, tothe questions of our defencepreparedness and compulsory militaryservice (&quot;tooth in relation to the air defence of Great Britain and generally)with a view to bringing proposals before the Cabinet in the ensuingweek.(2)    That further consideration should begiven to the Poreign Secretary&apos;suggestion that some StandingCommittee should be set up to sharewith  him the responsibility of examining the information receivedregarding developments in theinternational situation.
ITALY.t        .Relationswith France.J(previous Reference:Cabinet 18 (39)Conclusion 2.)8.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. FrancoisPoneet, the French Ambassador in Rome, had expressedthe opinion that it should be possible to get asettlement between France and Italy if we could persuade the French Government to take the first step.     The Prime Minister expressed the view thatthe French were not doing their share in smoothingout their difficulties with Italy.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to telegram No. 173 from Paris in which sir eric Phipps had reported M. Bonnet&apos;s view that france was prepared to do a deal with Italy over Jibuti andthe Suez Canal, and his desire that Sir percent,2Loraine should be sent to Rome as soon as possible,THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it wastime that the French took some action^themselves inthis matter and the FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed to putsuitable pressure on the French Government to this-end.
SALE OP 9.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thatANTI-AIRCRAFTMATERIAL TO     General Garaelin had asked as a matter of urgency,FRANCE.that we should supply the French with 20 3.7&quot;A.A.  guns.    It was proposed to let them have8   in May and IS in June together with 1,000rounds of ammunition per gun and predictorson the scale of 1 per 2 guns.    The French had asked for mobile guns, but we could onlysupply them with static guns.    If we let theFrench have these guns, it would, of course,diminish our state of readiness, but hethought that,  in the circumstances, we should meet the French request,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINIONAFFAIRS enquired whether it was necessary tosupply the French with predictors on the scale of 1 per 2 guns instead of on the scale, whichwe had adopted, of 1 per 4 guns.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARundertook to look into this matter.On the suggestion of THE PRIME MINISTER,it was agreed that the Secretary of State forWar should be authorised to arrange for thesupply to the French Government of the above a.A.  guns, ammunition and other material, onrepayment under the normal arrangements.
PALEST iks.ProposedCommandPaper.(previous reference:Cabinet 19(39), Con-clusion 3.)EK. l-U-iyoi) ^/^TWtJs)8 to7/Ca    / Ljp ,10.      The Cabinet had before them aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP.79(39)), submitting the draft of a proposedCommand Paper on Policy in Palestine, whichembodied a number of amendments agreed to bythe Cabinet Committee on Palestine.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THECOLONIES said that, as n^gotiationro were still proceeding with the representatives of the neighbouring Arab States,  it would be premature to invite the Cabinet to approve the draft white Paper.Paragraph 10 (4) of the draft white paper stated that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentanticipated that Palestinian representativescould be placed in charge of certain Departmentswithin 2 years of the restoration of peace and order.    The representatives of the neighbour-ing Arab States had, however, been pressingthat the Palestinians should be placed in charge-of a number of Departments as soon as peace and.order had been restored, without waiting for twoyears.    The Cabinet Committee on Palestine had decided to ascertain whether a concession onthis point would secure acceptance of theGovernment&apos;s proposals by representatives ofthe neighbouring Arab States/   With this object in view, a Memorandum had been sent on the6th April to the Egyptian Ambassador.    Thelatter had undertaken to telegraph its substanceto Ali Maher, who would get in touch with the iraqi and Saudi-Arabian Delegates in Cairo.
It had now &quot;been ascertained that representatives of the neighbouring Arab states were prepared to agree to our proposals, subject tothis modification and to modifications on two orthree other points on which the Secretary ofState thought we could^^e^fe-tegiftwmst    Therepresentatives of the neighbouring Arab Statesalso wanted us to re-open negotiations with the mufti and with the Palestinian Arabs,    TheSecretary of State -for the Colonies thought there were serious disadvantages in this course.He proposed that the points which he had mentioned   should be discussed at the meetingof the Cabinet Committee on Palestine whichwould be held on Thursday,  20th April.In normal times, no doubt, there wouldbe serious disadvantages in continuing without a fixed policy in regard to Palestine.    The presenttimes, however, were abnormal and it was clearthat the absence of policy had not adversely affected the military authorities who had beenvery successful in stamping out the rebellion,although isolated acts of terrorism must beexpected to continue for some time.    There wasthe further consideration that publication ofthese proposals would give rise to controversy inParliament.    There was, therefore, much to besaid for pursuing a somewhat cautious attitude i&apos;h iLt.- jfrrrrrOTffi in regard to our determination ofour Palestine policy.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH wished it to beput on record that, while the Cabinet Committee on
Palestine had approved the circulation of thedraft White Paper, it had been made clear thatthis did not necessarily mean that the Committeeendorsed the paper in every detail.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WARexpressed the view that our strategic requirements should be referred to not merely in paragraph10 (l) but also in paragraph 10 (6). -It was agreed that this point, which.had been referred to by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence at an earlier meetingof the Committee, should also be considered bythe Cabinet Committee on Palestine.The Cabinet took note of thestatement made by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and agreedthat the points raised in discussion should be considered by the CabinetCommittee on Palestine.
SUPPI*Y 11.       The Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumORGANISATIONIN PEACE AND by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (CP. 84 (39))(previous reference:     reviewing the question of the establishment of aCabinet 9(39), Con-     Ministry of Supply in the light of recent events andolusion 4).decisions, and outlining a plan for the equipment ofthe Regular and Territorial Armies.    At the end ofthe Memorandum the Ministers summarised their recommendations by asking their colleagues for authority -(a) To plan the equipment of the regular and Territorial Annies on the following basis -(i) To equip in peace with full warequipment, war reserves and war potential, a total of 16 Field Armydivisions (6 Regular and 10Territorial), the 10 territorial divisions being ready to gooverseas as soon after the outbreakof war as transport arrangementsallow and their training has beencompleted i.e. within   a period of4-6 months    (Para. 9).(ii) To provide equipment on a full wartraining scale for the remaining 16Territorial Field Army Divisions(Para. 10).(iii) To create such war potential for the16 Territorial Divisions under (ii)as could not be created after theoutbreak of war in sufficient timeto enable them to go overseas with full war equipment and reserveswithin   9-12 months from thatdate    (Para. 10).(iv) To provide the necessary equipment and war reserves for any additions to the Regular Army that may beauthorised.(b) To create forthwith a Ministry of Supply onthe special lines indicated in thisPapers viz:-(i) To take over all army supply (paras.5 and 15), with the exception ofcertain quartermaster-general stores and other services which require futher consideration   (Para. 17).
(ii) To take over the supply of such storesof general user as may he convenient(Para. 16).(iii) To take over the functions of design,research experiment and inspection forthe stores which it will supplya onthe understanding that the userdepartment remains closely associatedat all stages of design and in regardto standards of inspection    (Paras.23 and 22).(iv) The Ministry&apos;s vote to cover the staffof the Ministry, the provision of factories and stocks of essentialmaterials, and cost of manufacture(Para. 27).(v) The Ministry&apos;s vote to receiveappropriations in aid for the saleof supplies to user departments(para. 27).(c) For the introduction of legislation insuch a form that -(i) The Ministry could he progressivelyenlarged into a full Ministry ofSupplyr, if need bes without furtherlegislative authority    (Para.  15).(ii) ihe liinistry is given a statutoryright to enforce the acceptance of,and priority for, government orders(Para. 19), and possibly legal powers to determine prices after a cost investigation   (Para. 20),(&amp;) To supplement the existing machinery ofthe Principal Supply Officers Committeeand of the Contracts Co-co-ordinating committee by a Ministerial priority committee    (Para. 29).
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCEintroduced the Memorandum by drawing attention to itssalient points.      In regard to Part I, he said that neither he nor the Chancellor of the Duchy wishedto alter anything in their earlier Memorandum, butthat the situation which had now arisen was exceptional.The Secretary of State for War was faced with problems of great complexity and with duties outsidethe scope of a normal Defence Department.     TheSecretary of State for War had therefore reached theconclusion that supply responsibility should now bedetached from the War Office and placed in the handsof a separate Minister and Ministry.     He (theMinister) and the Chancellor of the Duchy felt thatthey must accept that conclusion.The Minister then dealt with the duties, powersand constitution of the new Ministry.     Paragraph 19provided for a statutory right to enforce acceptanceof, and priority for, Government orders.     Very  \,vicareful consideration should be given to the questionwhether it was wise to make a statutory provision to enforce the acceptance of Government orders,since if a particular industry or firm refusedto accept orders, the Government might be driven to take over that industry or firm.     As regardsthe priority machinery he did not anticipate any great interference with the Admiralty or AirMinistry orders, but there might be a risk of interference in certain respects.     He therefore thought it right that special priority machinery should be set up,
In regard to Part II of his Memorandum? theMinister explained that the proposal that 10Territorial Divisions should proceed overseas inthe 4 to 6 months immediately after the outbreakof war would result in 16 divisions in all (6 Regular,10 Territorial), or half the total Field Army, being available to proceed overseas during the months immediately following the outbreak of war.The Minister emphasised that- we should not reach the position which, under the plan, we aimed at being in, on the outbreak of war, until October-^1940.      By that date, we should be able to sendoverseas 16 divisions within a period of 4 to months, and the remaining 16 divisions within a year.It would take 18 months to provide the full (trainingequipment for the 13 additional Territorial divisions.The fact that it would take us so long to reach our objective was, however, an argument in favour ofmaking an early start on the plan proposed.     Ifwar broke out within a few months, we should be ina far better position as a result of having made aatart on the creation of additional factories and war potential.     Further, there was reason to thinkthat, under war conditions, the time occupied incarrying out the whole programme could be appreciablyshortened.-In reply to the Prime Minister, the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence explained that whileparagraphs 9 and 10 of CP. 84(39) represented the goal at which we were aiming, paragraph 11 related to the position as it existed to-day,
THE CHANCELLOR OE THE EXCHEQUER drew a distinctionbetween the Minister&apos;s proposal that 10 territorial divisions should be made ready to go overseas within4 to 6 months after the outbreak of war,  and the proposal that a further 16 divisions should be in a position to gooverseas within 12 months from the outbreak of war.      Asregards the former proposition, he had been anxious thatthis part of the plan should be limited to 8 divisions, butthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had informed him that he v/as satisfied that it was a practical propositionto make preparations now on the basis of 10 divisions, andhe agreed therefore that the plan should go forward onthis basis.     He doubted, however, whether we should proceed with the arrangements proposed for the remaining16 divisions.      He asked whether the scheme in regard tothese divisions had been fully worked out and whether theobject now aimed at was,  in fact, practicable.      he understood that the War Office attached considerably more importance to certain proposals in regard to the Regular Armythan to the implementing of the full scheme for doubling theTerritorial Army.      He suggested, therefore, that so faras Part II of the ministers Paper v/as concerned, a decision should be limited to the provision of war equipment, reserves and potential to enable 10 Territorial Divisions toproceed overseas within a period of 4 to 6 months after theoutbreak of war.     The proposals in regard to the rest of theTerritorial Army should be considered in connection withother proposals of the Secretary of State for War,  e. g. ,proposals relating to the Regular Army and to the Air Defenceof Great Britain.
THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR DOMINION affairs said that, as he saw the matter,  the question was one of creating the necessary capacity.     Unless a start wasmade on this now, the completion of the whole scheme would he delayed.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat there were certain requirements which could not possibly be created within 12 months after an outbreakof war, particularly in regard to filling factories and explosives.     If the action proposed was not takennow in regard to the supply elements which took a longtime to bring into production, it would be impossiblefor the^l6 Territorial Divisions to proceed overseaswithin a year of the outbreak of war.     He explainedthat the total cost of the scheme outlined in his paper was estimated at  135 millions, of which about 45 millions represented new industrial capacity,factories, etc, and  90 millions represented equipment.This figure of  135 millions compared with the figureof  90 millions as the cost of doubling the TerritorialArmy on the basis originally proposed, and  245 millions as the cost of the scheme set out in paragraph 8 of cp. 84 (39).     He explained that the scheme put forwardhad been considered by the Supply advisers, who regarded it as practicable0     Representatives of industry,however, had not been consulted.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR referred to theimpor tance of making sure that any available civilcapacity would be employed on the enlarged War office programme.     Until there had been consultation withleading industrialists, it would be impossible to say whether or not the scheme was practicable.     his information was that there was now very little furtherskilled labour available.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR WAR said that theproper test was to consider what effort this country would have to make if war broke out.     The rightprinciple, surely, was that all the Divisions of our army should be ready to play their part, and thealternative scheme in paragraph 8 was, in his view theonly logical plan.     If the scheme in paragraph 8 wasnot adopted, it was necessary that some supplyarrangements should be made in regard to the territorial divisions who would not be available to proceed overseasin the first six months of a war.     It was essential tohave a definite programme.     The programme now putforward was not, in the view of his advisers, by any means a very large programme.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not realised that the scheme in Part II of the Minister&apos;s paper had been worked out so far.     If it was clear thatthis scheme was accepted as practicable, he thought thatit should be adopted.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION thoughtthat the right test to adopt was whether the present scheme represented a maximum effort.     Having regard tothe language used in paragraph 18, he doubted whether thescheme could be so described.The discussion then turned to parts I and iii of CP.  84 (39).THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR agreed that theBill presented to the House of Commons should be a Billfor the setting up of a Ministry of Supply.     He thoughtit was desirable that the new Ministry should be regardedas in some sense a new organisation, which would make afresh start.     There were a number of points of detailwhich he thought might be considered, namely, whether
the new Ministry should, take over responsibility forgeneral stores of food and clothing for all three defence Departments.     The question of compulsory powers should also be carefully examined;    in particular, thelegal implications of priority for Government orders.He suggested that these points might be considered bythe Ministers concerned.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY and THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR expressed general agreementwith the procedure proposed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he was anxious that, if the new Ministry wasto obtain any special powers, those powers should bethorough-going.The Cabinet agreed:(l)    To approve in principle the recommendations contained in CP. 84 (39), as set out inthe summary to that Paper and reproducedabove;(2)    To invite the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster to arrange for theplan set out in CP. 84 (39) to be worked out in detail, and for a draftBill to be prepared, in consultation withthe three Service Ministers and any other ministers concerned.
(At this point, the Prime. Minister left the Meeting.)12.     THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that theAgenda for Cabinet Meetings were now apt to be longer than in recent years.     He suggested that the cabinet should meet at an earlier hour than 11 o&apos;clock.It was agreed:That the normal weekly Meetingsof the Cabinet should until further notice take place at 10,30 a.m.
JppeviousReference:jCabinet 601(38), Con-conclusion   22,)13. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Privy Seal (CP. 86(39)) on the subject of air raid Shelter Policy,  to which were attached the following documents:-(l)    The Report of the Conference,presided over by Lord Hailey,  toconsider and advise on the issuesunderlying the provision of heavilyprotected air raid shelters:(2)   A Memorandum by the Lord Privy Sealon the above Report, which came beforethe Civil Defence (Policy) Committeeon the 14th April at their FifthMeeting (C.D.S.(p) 12):(3)    The Conclusions of the Civil Defence(Policy) Committee.In CP. 86(39) the Lord Privy Seal sought theapproval of his colleagues for the presentation toParliament on Thursday,  20th April, of the Report of theConference, as a Command Paper.     He proposed that onthe same day he should make a statement accepting generally the principles laid down in the Report, subject to anumber of points of detail which would recmire furtherconsideration, and announcing that the following conclusions had been reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government(a) that no ground was shown for departing from the policy of blast and splinter-proof protection already announced,and the Government would accordingly make every effort to assure its being carriedout as speedily as possible invulnerable areas:(b) that the attempt at the provision on anygeneral scale of deep and bomb-proofshelters would be a mistaken policy andwould prove unattainable in practice:(c) that there was a. case for providing heavilyprotected shelter for certain key points and certain vital services:(d) that technical advice would be afforded as speedily as possible to industrialistsand others as to the forms which suchshelters might take.
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that hewas anxious to make a statement in regard tothis matter on the following day.     He thoughtthat the Government would he exposed to criticism if there was any long delay in making anannouncement.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIRsaid that the Air Ministry were in agreementwith the lines of the proposed statement ofGovernment policy in regard to air raidshelters.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE exchequer said that the Treasury had seen the proposed statement by the Lord Privy Seal, and v/ouldlike to have an opportunity of discussing oneor two points in the announcement with theLord Privy Seal&apos;s Department.This course was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIRreferred to certain difficulties which had arisen in regard to the provision of structural air raid precautions in a number of factories which were engaged on Government contracts,where the contracts were placed on the basisof &quot;target prices&quot; or of competitive tender.This matter had been under discussion for sometime.THE CHANCELLOR. OF THE EXCHEQUER saidthat he did not think this question was altogetherrelevant to the present matter, but he undertook to do his best to ensure that it was settled at an earl;/ date.
The Cabinet agreed-(l)   To approve the presentation toParliament, as a white Paper, of theReport of the Conference preside over by Lord Hailey-(ii)   To approve the statement which theLord Privy Seal proposed to make,announcing the conclusions reached by His Majesty&apos;s Government inregard to shelter policy, subjectto the settlement of outstanding points between the Treasury andthe Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Department.
