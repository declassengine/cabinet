THE INTER- 1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he regrettedNATIONALSITUATION. having had to call his colleagues together at the week-previous end, hut it seemed that we were entering upon anotherReference:Cabinet 11 (39) rather troubled period.Conclusion 2)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said^fi^^ that the immediate trouble had arisen out of a messagey which had been conveyed to him by the roumanian minister in London.     ^The substance of this messagewas summarised in the telegrams to His Majeety&apos;representatives at Warsaw, Angora, Athens and Belgradewhich are referred to below^     The message from theRoumanian Minister had been reinforced by information which had been communicated by the Roumanian military attache to the Secretary of State for War.     TheRoumanian Minister (M. Tilea) had said that the GermanGovernment had asked Roumania to agree to give germany monopoly of Roumanian exports and to accept measuresof industrial restriction inside Roumania in Germaninterests,,     If Roumania agreed to take these stepsGermany would guarantee the frontiers of Roumania.The Roumanian Minister, however, represented that theseproposals took the form of an ultimatum, and that developments might be expected within a matter of days.The Foreign Secretary said that if this matter was to be considered as one of urgency, it wasnecessary that the Cabinet should have information as.to the attitude of the adjacent States.     Accordinglytelegrams had been drafted to our representatives inthe four Capitals referred to above.     He was not cer-tain whether these telegrams&apos; had all been despatched,orwhether, if they had been despatched, action had beentaken on them.    The reason for this was that a message had been
received that afternoon from our Minister at Bucharestasking that action should he suspended on these telegrams.    Our representatives in the four Capitalsconcerned had accordingly been instructed to hold their hands.The Foreign Secretary then read out to hiscolleagues telegram. Noc 45 from Bucharest, a copy ofwhich is appended to these Minutes.      This telegramshowed that the Roumanian Minister for Foreign Affairsentirely denied that there was any truth in the reportof a German ultimatum, and asserted that the economicnegotiations with Germany were proceeding on completelynormal linescThe Foreign Secretary said that the roumanian minister in London, Mo Tilea, had been telephoned toand still adhered to the view that his information was correct,.      There were reasons for thinking thatthe discrepancy in the information might perhaps bedue to personal differences between the roumanian minister for Foreign Affairs and the roumanian minister in London.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that hehad asked Sir Alexander Cadogan to make furtherendeavours to clear the matter up with M. Tilea.Although it therefore seemed that Roumania wasnot faced with the immediately threatening situationwhich had been thought to exist, the Foreign secretary thought that it would be an advantage if theCabinet took this opportunity of considering what our position would be if a situation such as
had been envisaged were to arise in the future.He reported that he had seen the United states ambassador that morning, who had warmly approved the PrimeMinisters speech at Birmingham on the 17th March, but had added that it carried with it the connotation that thiscountry would not submit to further aggressive action on germany&apos;s part.The French Ambassador, who had also called on him,had said that in his view the speech was on absolutelythe right lines.      He had added that perhaps it had seemed,during the first two days or so,  as if British opinion hadreacted somewhat slowly to recent events, but that after a little time for reflection British opinion had, as was so often the case,  taken up a very definite line.The Russian Ambassador, whom he had also seen that day, had made it plain that he was speaking withoutinstructions.      He had made some rather general statements to the effect that the Russian Government&apos;s purpose was to resist aggression, and had indicated that more definite information might be received from M0 Litvinoff.      He had added that he thought that there was probably   no immediate danger of an attack on Roumania;    and indeedthat Roumania was not likely to be the next objective ofGermany;    but he had...thought that Germany might now turnher attention to Croatia.&apos;  The Foreign Secretary said that he had asked theGerman Ambassador to come and see him in order to made a complaint about the action of certain members of theGerman Embassy staff in London.      The German Ambassador,however, had at once made a complaint about remarks aboutHerr Hitler, made by Mr. Duff Cooper in the House ofCommons on March 16th.       He had made it plain that he wasspeaking without instructions from Berlin.
The Foreign Secretary had replied that whateverviews might he held as to the undesirability of using strong language about the Heads of States,he thought that Herr Hitler was not perhaps in avery strong position to make a complaint, havingregard to remarks which he had made about DrD Benes.He had added that, having regard to. the somewhatviolent remarks which Herr Hitler had made about aprivate Member of Parliament, it was not altogethersurprising that that Member of parliament had made some reply.     Dr. von Dirksen had then asked if he should repeat to Berlin what the foreign secretary had said about Dr, Benes, to which he had replied that his only reason for mentioning this had been to show that Herr Hitler did not observe the strict rule that no attack should be made onHeads of States.,     Dr0 von Dirksen had then askedwhether the Foreign Secretary would send a formalreply to his complaint, to which he had replied byasking Dr. von Dirksen whether he really wanted suchan answer.     Dr. von Dirksen had said that he would think the matter overt,The Foreign Secretary said that the german ambassador had again called to see him that afternoon and had enquired about the withdrawal ofour Ambassador from Berlin.     He had asked whetherthis was on the same footing as the withdrawal of theUnited States Ambassador from Berlin.     The foreign secretary said that he had replied that he did not knowexactly on what footing the United States had withdrawntheir Ambassador.     We had recalled our Ambassador toreport, and the time of his return to Berlin would, nodoubt, depend upon his report.     He had made it plain,however,, that the recall of our Ambassador to report wasa mark of our distress at the action taken by Germany,- 4 -
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs then read a letter from our Ambassador in Parisgiving certain information from a secret sourceas to the probable German attitude towards thiscountry.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said thathe thought that it would be profitable to considerthe position in regard to Roumania in the light ofthe views of our expert advisers.      Subject to thatadvice, however, and looking at the matter on political grounds, his view was that, if Germany committed an act of naked aggression on Roumania, it would be verydifficult for this country not to take all the actionin her power to rally resistance against that aggression,and to take part in that resistance herself.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that he had called the Chiefs of Staff together and asked them to draw up an aide memoire for him touse at the Cabinet.     They had, however, had verylittle time to consider the matter, and the questioninvolved so many considerations that it had notbeen possible for the Chiefs of Staff to reach anyconsidered conclusion on the whole question.     Hehad also had the opportunity of discussing thematter for a few minutes with the Defence Ministers,So far as they had been able to consider thematter, the view of the Chiefs of Staff was as follows
Germany had threatened to take action which/wouldresult in the economic domination of roumania.&apos;Once Roumanian agriculture and oil production had been organised with German efficiency* Germany^strategic position would he greatly improved,since she .would he able..almost to neutralise theefforts of the British Navy to blockade her in timeof war.     On this basis, it was necessary to decide whether the economic advantages which would accrue to Germany were so serious that we should take action to prevent German economic domination overRoumani a.There was a further consideration that,if Germany could dominate Roumania economically,political domination of that country would almost certainly follow.     This would have even more serious consequences, since there would be nothing to prevent Germany from marching straight through to the Mediterranean, more especially since she could rely on Bulgarian friendship.The economic domination of Roumania thusseemed likely,to lead to very serious consequences.We ourselves, however, could not take any actionwhich would prevent Germany from dominatingRoumania.     The position in this respect was very similar to that which had faced us in Septemberin regard to Czechoslovakia.     The only help which
this country could give would be to engage^, inconjunction with France, in hostilities on theWestern Front, and such hostilities would have no practical effect in preventing Roumania from being over-run.      If, however, the support of poland and Russia could be secured the position would be entirely changed.     He thought that the provisionalview of the Chiefs of Staff would be that, ifPoland and Russia would be prepared to help us, we should join with them in resistingGerman &apos;ag,^&apos;ression.If, however, Poland or Russia were unwilling to help us, the only plan which appeared feasiblewas that we should obtain the support of turkey and Greece,     An alliance with Turkey wouldhave more military value to us than an alliance with Greece.     The latter country was not strongin a military sense and had a long and difficultland frontier.     The position in regard to yugoslavia was also uncertain.     Generally,it would be more to our interests that Greeceshould be a neutral than an ally.     This was as far as the Chiefs of Staff had been ableto get in the time available to them.     Theyhad, however, made it clear that they attachedconsiderable importance to Italy&apos;s attitude.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that up tilla week ago we had proceeded on the assumption thatwe should he able to continue with our policy of getting on to better terms with the DictatorPowers, and that although those powers had aims,those aims were limited.     We had   all along had at the back of our minds the reservation that this might not prove to be the case but we had felt that itwas right to try out the possibilities of this course.On the previous Wednesday, the Germanaction in Czechoslovakia had only  usttaken place,, and the information available had been so imperfect, that neither he nor any of hiscolleagues had had time to give the matter properconsideration, or to decide how far the situation had changed.     It had been unfortunate that, owing to theOpposition1^ demands, it had been necessary to havea debate in the House of Commons immediately on theheel of these events.The Prime Minister said he had now comedefinitely to the conclusion that Herr Hitler&apos;attitude made it impossible to continue to negotiate on the old basis with the Nazi regime.     This did not mean that negotiations with the German people wereimpossible.     No reliance could be placed on anyof the assurances given by the Nazi leaders.On the occasions when he had met Herr Hitler,he had thought that while Herr Hitler might mean what he said, it was always possible thathe would find reasons to change his views later.
The Prime Minister said that it was onthe basis of this conclusion, and after consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, and others of hiscolleagues who were immediately available, thathe had made his speech at Birmingham on the17th March,     He thought that the speech had been generally approved in this country.The Cabinet indicated their warm approvalof the Prime Minister&apos;s speech.The Prime Minister said that he regarded his speech as a challenge to Germany on the issuewhether or not Germany intended to dominateEurope by force.     It followed that if Germanytook another step in the direction of dominatingEurope, she would be accepting the challenge.     AGerman attempt to dominate Roumania was, therefore,more than a question whether Germany would therebyimprove her strategical position;    it raised thewhole question whether Germany intended to obtaindomination over the whole of South Eastern Europe.&apos;He agreed, therefore, with the Foreign Secretary&apos;view that if Germany was to proceed with this courseafter warning had been given, we had no alternative but to take up the challenge.     On this basisour next course was to ascertain what friends wehad who would join with us in resisting aggression.Asked whether we alone should resist german aggression, the Prime Minister said that this was notin his mind,     He added that he thought that at leastwe could rely cn the co-operation of the French.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought itmight he necessary to consider what would he the mostsuitable opportunity to take up the challenge.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was not asking the Cabinet to determine there and then whether weshould declare war on Germany if Germany invadedRoumania.     What he wished to ascertain was whetherthe Cabinet agreed generally with the change ofpolicy which he had outlined^     The question of themoment at which we should make our stand was aseparate issue.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that hewas in entire agreement with the Prime Minister&apos;sBirmingham speech, and with the analysis which thePrime Minister had just made.THE SECRETARY  OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that it.was no doubt highly desirable that weshould have France, Poland, Turkey and the U.S.S.R.as allies in resisting German agression.        Itshould, however, be remembered that even if thereports of feelings in Germany and Italy werediscounted, a war which did not have immediate and conclusive success, might have importantinternal reactions in Germany.      It might be thatsuch a reaction would only follow under the pressure of Germany getting rashly engaged in war.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER agreed, but said the extent of such pressure on German opinion would depend on the attitude which we took up beingknown in Germany before Germany&apos;s    a o t   of aggressiontook places      If this was done, it was possible thatthe effect on German public opinion might be toprevent the war startingo
THE LORD CHANCELLOR said he would liketo make one or two possible qualificationson what had been said0 First,that itwould make a great difference to public opinion,particularly in the Dominions, if Roumaniawere to put up a real fight. Secondly,he thought that there was a good deal &quot;which still remained to be done which would be ofgreat importance in a world ?/arc Againour position in the East should be carefullyconsideredo Might not the Congress Partyin India seize the opportunity to declarea break with this country?       While he had reached the conclusion that we should probably have to fight Germany before very long, he thought that if we could put offthe evil day, our position would be improved.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINIONAFFAIRS said that he had seen the high commissioners for the Dominions that after-noon and had explained the situation to themand had endeavoured to obtain some indication of their views.     With the exception ofMr. Jordan (whose silence probably did not mean dissent) they had all said that they agreed entirely with the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech which was in accordance with what theDominions would have expected to be saidc
When he had endeavoured to secure afurther indication of their views, the HighCommissioner for Canada had said that hethought that the Canadian people might askwhy, if we did not go to war with Germanyover Czechoslovakia, we should do so in regardto Roumania;    Mr. Massey had also made thepoint that if Germany attacked Roumania andwe then declared war on Germany it might healleged that we were attacking Germany inthe West,The High Commissioner for South Africa&apos;attitude had made it plain that opinion inSouth Africa seemed likely to support us in resisting German aggression0      This was perhapspartly-due to--the...fact that anti-German feeling was runnin high in the Cape with regard to a recentepisode in connection with 150 Germans who hadbeen sent by ship to South Africa and had been refused permission to land6The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairscontinuing, said that he found it difficult tosee how we could take effective action againstGermany if we were now to declare war on her.The situation would be much the same as in last september.      If, however, it was possible toorganise an effective combination among the states in South Eastern Europe, the position would be greatly changed and much improved.     He feltthat if .Roumania was overrun and Germany advanced to the Mediterranean and the Aegaean, we shouldbe in danger of becoming a second-class Power.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THECOLONIES said that he realised that no decision was being asked for as to the action thatwe should take if Germany invaded Roumania.But at the moment he was disposed to agreewith the view of the Secretary of State forthe Dominions that if we failed to take up thischallenge, we should lose the support of allthe nations whose help we should require later.He was in full agreement with the PrimeMinister&apos;s views,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR,while in agreement with the views already given, stressed the importance of choosingthe right moment for opposing Germany,He thought the answer really depended uponthe amount of help which we could obtain fromother countries.     It must also be rememberedthat our position would be far strongerby the end of the year.        He thought that itwas clear that Roumania&apos;s own decision would depend to a considerable extent on theattitude of other countries.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OFDEFENCE said that the whole position inSouth-Eastern Europe had been greatly changedby the German absorption of Czechoslovakiawhich brought her within reach of Roumania.
If, on further consideration, the view wastaken that the economic domination of Roumaniaby Germany would lead also to politicaldomination of that country and that this wouldinvolve us in serious strategical consequences,then, in his opinion, our right course was toorganise political support in South-eastern europe.     He thought that the inter-weavingof the political and strategic considerationsmade it very difficult for the Chiefs of staff to deal with the situation now envisaged untilthe main lines of our policy had been determined.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADEexpressed agreement with the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech at Birmingham and with his analysis ofthe position.     He thought that in consideringGerman aggression on Roumania the real point was, not whether we could prevent Roumania from being overrun, hc;.t whether, if we went to war withGermany, we could defeat her.      If this happened,  the fact that Roumania might be temporarily overrun would not affect the finalissue.     The events of the last war showed thatthis was so.Continuing, the President said that hethought that it was important, in approachingother countries not to lay too much emphasis on the fact that our attitude would depend upon theirs.      In his view it was important that we should make it clear that we were in
favour of action to resist German aggressionif they would support us, and that if we didnot give a lead in this way, we should not obtain any results.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thathe thought the Chiefs of Staff attached greatimportance to Germany being compelled to fighton two fronts.      If Poland and Russia were our allies there would be a big battle front in theEast   as well as in the West and Herr hitler was greatly averse to being faced with this situation.      Provided we could ensure Germanyhaving to face a war on two fronts,  there was much less likelihood of war and we should bemore likely to win if war came about.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLANDthought that it was important to lose no timein making the necessary approaches to thecountries concerned.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE addedthat he thought it was undesirable that theseapproaches should be confined to the questionof a possible attack on Roumania as the attackmight in fact fall elsewhere.     The guaranteesshould be joint and several.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that if opposition to German aggressionwas to be organised,  it had to be done by thiscountry, as there was no one else in a positionto do it.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs thought there was great force in the point putby the President of the Board of Trade, but thatit was impossible to anticipate where the nextthreat would fallo     The real issue was Germany1sattempt to obtain world domination, which it wasin the interest of all countries to resist.     he agreed that we were the only country who couldorganise such resistance.     It was, no doubt, equallydifficult for this country to find effective meansof attacking Germany, whether Germany attackedRoumania or Holland4     The attitude of the GermanGovernment was either bluff, in which case itwould be stopped by a public declaration on our partjor it was not bluff,- in which case it was necessarythat we should all units&apos;to meet it, and the soonerwe united the better^     Otherwise we might see one country after another absorbed by Germany.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that itwas necessary to choose between the dangers ofprocrastination, on the one hand, and the immenseadvantages which we should gain by postponing theissue for another six or nine months.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR concurred inthis statement of our dilemma.     He also referred tothe danger of speaking in terms of military attacks on this and that country     We were now faced with anew technique, which brought about collapse frominside.     This new technique made it difficult todetermine at what point we should make our stand against German aggressionc     He was in favour ofreconsidering our policy and contracting frank and open alliances with countries such as Poland and russia.     He also thought that it would be necessary
to take steps vastly to increase our military strength.     Germany had just seized in Chechoslovakiathe complete equipment of 38 infantry and 8 mobiledivisions.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that he thoughtpublic opinion had changed considerably in the past few days.     Whereas in the autumn the detestationof war had perhaps counted for more than hatredof tyranny, he thought the position was nowreversed.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the realpoint at issue was whether we could obtainsufficient assurances from other countries, to justifyus in a public pronouncement that we should resist any further act&apos;of aggression on the part of Germany,He thought that such an announcement might deterGermany, at any rate for a period, and that weshould take full advantage of the breathing-spacethus offered.     He thought that Poland was very likely the key to the situation, and he suggestedthat our communication to Poland should probablybe to go somewhat further than our communications to other countries.     We should not merely askwhat attitude Poland would adopt, but we should explain how we envisaged the situation, and that we thought that the time had how come for those whowere threatened by German aggression (whetherimmediately or ultimately) to get together.     We shouldenquire how far Poland was prepared to go alongthese lines.     The attitude of other countries would obviously be affected if Poland decided tojoin with us.
In reply to a question as to relations between Russiaand Japan, THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the view held was that Japan was now so deeply involvedin. China that Russia&apos;s Eastern Army was capable of meetingany forces which Japan could oppose to Russia in the far east.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought that it was most import-ant to get into touch with Russia, since Russia&apos;s attitude would have very considerable effect upon the smaller Powers.Questions were then asked as to Poland&apos;s position.It was explained that Poland&apos;s Treaty with Roumania onlybound her to help Roumania in case of attaok by Russia;but the Roumanian Minister had sp-oken as though Poland would support Roumania if attacked by Germany.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA agreed that it was essential that we should make an approach to Poland,Roumania and Yugo-Slavia and possibly other powers, and let them know what was in our minds.       At the same time hethought that if the issue could be postponed a little longerit would be to our advantage.In regard to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s remarks, he thoughtthat Moslem opinion in India would be somewhat reassured by our Palestine proposals, and he did not anticipate more thana certain degree of embarrassment for a short time at theoutbreak of a war.     At the same time, owing to the fact thatthe number of British troops had been largely reduced in thelast year, it might be difficult to spare troops from india for a time until we saw how matters were going.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE asked whether,  ifwe offered to give assistance to the Powers in South-eastern Europe if they were attacked by Germany, we should endeavour to secure their help if Germany attacked us inthe West?THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the great thing wasto make a start with communications on the basis alreadyproposed.    If need be, their scope could be extended later.,-18-
THE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought that on thewhole an attack in the West was more likely than one in the EastoTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERpointed out the need for continuing these enquirieswith discretion, otherwise we would he accused of apolicy of encirclement, and run the risk of provokingattack,THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION raised the question whether steps should he taken toincrease our preparedness for war, e. g. by partialmeasures for mobilisation0After discussion, it was agreed that measuresof this character were not justified at the presenttime,THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEexplained that the Chiefs of Staff were disposed tothink that it would take Germany perhaps a couple ofmonths to clear up the present situation before she would be prepared to launch an attack in the West.He added that the Chiefs of Staff wished him to informthe Cabinet that, if there was any likelihood of our being engaged in war with Germany, we should take immediate steps to increase our preparedness and therate of production,,THE PRIME MINISTER at this point read out a message which had been received from the officialGerman News Agency issuing a denial of the report thatGermany had delivered an ultimatum to Roumania.     Itwas stated that there was no evidence of a general order for further mobilisation of reservists,-
although there might have been individual    cases of young reservists being called up for duty.     a message had been received from the Foreign Office tothe effect that the German Government had recalledtheir Ambassador, Dr. von Dirksen.THE PRIME MINISTER said that his view was thatGermany was not likely to make an immediate   attack onRoumania.     He thought, however, that we should take immediate steps to approach those countries which hadbeen mentioned, in order that we could make a strongpronouncement of our determination to resist furtherGerman aggression with the knowledge that we shouldbe supported in that   action,,The Cabinet agreed:(l)    To approve generally the new line ofpolicy proposed by the prime Minister,namely, that we should make approaches toRussia, Poland? Y^go-Slavia, Turkey, greece and Roumania with a view to obtainingassurances from them that they would join with us in resisting any act of Germanagrees ion aimed at obtaining dominationin South-East Europe.      The French Gover-ment would, of course, be kept fully informed and action concerted with them.(2)    That, provided satisfactory assiirances canbe obtained, we should make a. public pro-pronouncement of our intention to resist anysuch act of German aggression.(3)    That the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState for Foreign. Affairs, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade should be authorised to approve the telegrams to be sent to thecountries named, with a view to obtainingthese assurances, and that a Meeting shouldbe held for this purpose at 2o30 p.m*on Sunday, 19th March.(4)    That for the present, until the results ofthese approaches had been ascertained, itwas unnecessary to invite the Chiefs ofStaff to prepare a further StaffAppreciation^s   Subsequently altered to 11.30 a.m.
2.    THE PRIMS MINISTER said that it would be necessary  for the position in regard to our defence preparations to he further examined.He suggested that the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence should carry out this task with his Service Colleagues and theLord Privy Seal.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that he thought that the main action thatwe could take in this respect would he first toquicken up production by such means as ensuringnight shifts, and, secondly, to strengthen ourposition in the Middle East.      He thought thatthe production question was largely hound up with obtaining increased skilled labour, whichwould necessarily involve taking away labour from existing industry and thereby might causesome disturbance.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR thought that the skilled labour difficulty could be met to someextent by the spreading of the work over a wider area by means of further sub-contracting,i^e gave an instance of this which he had recently seen at Elswick.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said thathe could not subscribe   without qualificationto the statement made by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence.      It had been found possible to secure an increase from 5 to 6 percento each month in the labour employed on
aircraft production. Much of this labour wasnot expert.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADEstressed the difficulties which might result if existing industry was denuaea of its skilled labour.     This might result in throwing largenumbers out of work, in seriously damaging our export trade and in weakening our financial resources. jTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thatthere were certain matters which were atpresent delayed pending discussion of theReport of the Expert Committee on the Defence ofIndia.     He was anxious that these matters shouldbe disposed of without delay.      He also mentioned Part II of the scheme for the air defence of Great Britain.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtthat the Committee should concentrate on short-term projects.It was agreed:That a Committee should be appointedto consider our Defence programmes and their Acceleration, composed asfollows:-The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.        (In the Chair)The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Privy Seal.The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.The President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Labour.
3.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that after his speech on the previous night at Birmingham in which he had saidthat it would he necessary to review every aspect of our national life from the point of view of national safety,it would he necessary to consider a number of -matters.For example, the issue of conscription might he raised,or the establishment of a Ministry of Supply.    Or itmight be said that further powers should be obtained tofacilitate the transfer of labour to the-production ofarmaments.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat a number of persons were looking for some actionwhich went beyond a national register, and thought thatthe State should have powers to direct individualsto take particular jobs.    This clearly raised broadpolitical issues.     He thought that provided it couldbe made plain that we were determined to resist anyacts of aggression, this, would have an important influence upon those whose co-operation we requiredeTHE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he did not think there was any sign as yet of any change in publicopinion such as the Foreign Secretary suggested. .    any suggestion of compulsion at the present time would,for example, result in the resignation from the voluntary National Service Committees of therepresentatives of the Trade Unions.     Any developments,however, in regard to Russia might modify the positionmaterially.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed that therewas a body of opinion which desired to see on theStatute Book an Act conferring on the Governmentcompulsory powers^     It was thought in some quartersthat the Government might require to use such powers in
advance of the conferment of powers which we shouldohtain by war legislation.     According to this view, thepassing of such an Act would/be most striking evidenceof the determination of the people of this country, andwould have considerable psychological effect.      It wasagreed, however, that if the attempt to pass such an act was made prematurely, the result would be to dogreat damage to our prestige.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY enquired whether it wouldbe possible to invite the Leaders of the opposition parties to discuss the proposal that, assuming it waspossible to make a pronouncement of our foreign policy on the lines indicated, they would assent to thepassing through Parliament of a short statute givingthe Government compulsory powers over labour.     he appreciated that this idea required a good deal offurther elaboration.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thismatter required a good deal of further consideration, andhe rather doubted&apos;whether the Leaders of.the opposition were   likely    to adopt a very helpful attitude.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that the Trade union leaders who were being most helpful from the point ofview of voluntary national service, were at presententirely opposed to compulsion.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought that the attitudeof Russia would provide the key to this problem.The Cabinet agreed to defer further considerationof this matter..
ROUMANIA.Trade mission to.(previous reference:Cabinet  3 (39)Conclusion 4).   4.    THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat he had to answer a Question on Monday inregard to the proposed Trade Mission to Roumania.He reminded his colleagues that the Cabinet had decided that this Mission should not be despatcheduntil he had been able to inform the GermanGovernment of our intentions during the courseof his visit to Berlin, which had now been postponed.   He thought that it was undesirable,in present circumstances, to announce our decision to send a Mission to Roumania, without prior consultation with the Roumanian Government.The Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take stepsto consult Roumania in this matter,and that until this had been done,no public announcement should be made.
CZECHOSLOVAKBALANCES INTHE COUNTRY.(previous reference:Cabinet 11 (39)Conclusion 2. )5. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER reminded hiscolleagues that he had already announced, in answer toa Question, that the Bank of England had been instructed not to transfer Czechoslovak balances outof this country without instructions from the Treasury.Similar instructions had also been issued to otherbanks.When Germany had incorporated Austria in the reich, the German authorities had taken steps to collect Austrian assets in other countries and had then repudiated Austrian liabilities.     It was desirable to prevent Germany repeating this procedure in the case of Czechoslovakia.     To give effect tothe instructions which had already been given, itwould be necessary to give an indemnity to the banksin respect of any legal actions which might be brought against them as the result of their refusal to honourdrafts drawn on Czechoslovak balances in this country.He therefore proposed to ask Parliament for the necessary powers.     A Bill had been drafted for this purpose.In the normal course this Bill would have come beforethe Committee of Home Affairs.     In the    specialcircumstances he asked authority to dispense with thiscourse and to present the Bill to Parliament early inthe ensuing week.     As an instance of the need for this measure, the Chancellor mentioned that of the  3,500,000(out of the total of  10 millions of financial assistance)which Czechoslovakia had drawn, only a part had beendevoted to the purposes for which we had promised
Czechoslovakia a free gift.     The rest of the sumsdrawn had been used for other purposes, in respectof which Czechoslovakia had promised to make repaymentto us when the proposed guaranteed loan had beenissued.The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer to introduce the Bill tothe House of Commons without priorsubmission to the Committee of HomeAffairs.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,18th March, 1939.
ANNEX.NO DISTRIBUTION.Decypher.      Sir R. Hoare (Bucharest),18th March, 1939.D.      BY TELEPHONE.      18th March, 1939.R.      3.40 p.m. 18th March,  1939.No. 45.My immediately preceding telegram.It appeared to me so utterly improbable thatthe Minister for Foreign Affairs would not have informed me that an immediate threatening situation had developedhere that I called on him as soon as your telegrams toWarsaw and Moscow had been decyphered.      He told methat he was being inundated with enquiries regardingreport of German ultimatum which had appeared in &quot;the times&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; to-day.     There was not a word of truth in it.I asked how negotiations with Doctor Wohlthatv/ere progressing and told him the gist of what theRoumanian Minister had said to Your Lordship yesterday.Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed bewilderment and maintained under close cross-examinatipn that economicnegotiations with the Germans were proceeding oncompletely normal lines as between equals.      He assuredme most positively that there had been no attempthitherto to introduce politics into the discussions andthat the tone of the German negotiations was moreconciliatory since the Czech coup than before.      Ministerfor Foreign Affairs was in fact absolutely positive thatfor the moment there was no threat to Roumania&apos;political or economic independence.
Minister for Foreign Affairs is distressedthat the Roumanian Minister should in an excess of zealhave misrepresented the situation and will endeavour toensure that this shall not recur.     He implied that hewould be very grateful if you did not withdraw yourentire confidence from Roumanian Minister.      With thegreatest diffidence as I realise the enormity of hisblunder I venture to endorse Minister for ForeignAffairs&apos; views.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 45 ofMarch 18th, repeated to Moscow and Warsawand figures by post to Angora, Belgradeand Athens.
