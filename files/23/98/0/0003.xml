INTERNATIONAL 1.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSTUATIONoreminded his colleagues that at the Meeting held onevious Saturday, 18th March, the Cabinet had agreed thatferencejbinet IS (39)        we should make approaches to Russia, Poland, Yugo-conclusion 1.)Slavia, Turkey, Greece and Roumania, with a view to obtaining assurances from them that they would join with us in resisting any act of German aggressionaimed at obtaining domination in South-eastern europe,     The Cabinet had also agreed that the PrimeMinister,  the Chancellor of the Exchequer, thePresident of the Board of Trade and himself shouldbe authorised to approve the telegrams to be sent tothese countries.When the matter had been examined at the meetings held on Sunday,  19th March, he and hiscolleagues had come to the conclusion that, whileit was important that some action should be takenquickly, if we attempted to do too much we mightend by achieving no positive results for a longtime.     From this point of view it appeared that theessential point was to secure the early consent ofFrance, Russia and Poland to some pronouncement whichcould be made public.     A pronouncement of this character would by itself have a steadying effect,and it could, of course, be followed up by an examination of the particular situation of Roumania,and by approaches to the other smaller States.A draft telegram had accordingly beenprepared on this basis, for despatch to His Majesty&apos;ammbassadors at Paris, Moscow and Warsaw, and had been circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 75 (39)),Tiie Foreign Secretary drew attention to thefact that the formula spoke of &quot;the security and
political independence of European States&quot;, whereas theCabinet Conclusion of the 18th March had related to&quot;German aggression aimed at obtaining domination in South-Bast Europe&quot;.     It was felt that if the declaration were confined to South-Eastern Europe, a State such as poland would ask whether it was intended to resist an act ofGerman aggression aimed against her.     Further, it was feltthat Eastern States such as Poland would recognise thatthey had an interest in resisting German aggression evenif that aggression took the form of an attack in the West.It might be suggested that a pledge &quot;to consult together in the event of any action being taken which appeared to constitute a threat to the said security   and independence&quot;, was not a very heroic decision.     As against this it should be pointed out, first, that it was very important to take some action quickly;    secondly, that apublic declaration of solidarity between the four states concerned would have an immense political significance;thirdly, that it was impossible to attempt to reachimmediate decisions as to the action which should be taken,in view of the enormous variety of circumstances which might arise.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the Debate inthe House of Commons, on the previous Wednesday, theChancellor of the Exchequer had dealt with a suggestion,that we should get all nations of good will together, andthat we should &quot;draw a line&quot; and make up our minds alltogether to resist by force any attempt to go beyond thatline-.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer    in reply, had explained that it was impossible.for us to accept soextensive and indefinite a commitment as that suggested.The Prime Minister also referred to a statement made by the Secretary of State for India at the Cabinet on
March 15th when he had referred to the difficulty of framing a pronouncement which would fit all the variouscircumstances which might arise.The draft now before the Cabinet aimed atavoiding specific commitments which, even if entered into,would be sure to omit types of circumstances which might easily give rise to a threat to the security and independence of European States.     The formula left itopen what would constitute a &quot;threat&quot; and what steps weshould take in the event of a &quot;threat&quot;.     Although,therefore, the pronouncement did not involve us in anyactual new commitment, public opinion would certainly attachsignificance to such a declaration signed by the four powers, and they would assume that if we consulted togethersome action would follow.The Prime Minister said that it would benecessary for the four Powers concerned to consult together and consider what action they could take.    Promthis point of view, the precise form which the casus bellimight take was perhaps not very material.     The real issue was that if Germany showed signs that she intended toproceed with her march for world domination, we must take steps to stop her by attacking her on two fronts.     Weshould attack Germany, not in order to save a particularvictim, but in order to pull down the bully^     He thoughtthat the four Powers should consider the situation in thislight, and decide what military action they could take inorder that such a war could be conducted to the best advantage.
Continuing, the Prime Minister said that publicopinionwould no doubt suggest that we ought not to confine ourselves to approaches to Paris, Moscow andWarsaw, but should endeavour to secure the support of anumber of smaller States.    He doubted whether  theadvantage to be gained from this course was as great as might be supposed...       If the little States were all to become parties to the arrangement entered into,they would be tempted to adopt a very rigid line aboutminor matters, and this might precipitate the verysituation which we wished to avoid.    On the other hand,certain countries might be able to afford us aparticular measure of assistance.    He had Turkeyespecially in mind.    But he was certain that the right course was first to make an approach to the threebig Powers and obtain a declaration, on the lines proposed,to the effect that they had decided to work together.    He thought that the Cabinet should recognisethat this was a bold step and involved a considerable advance on any action which we had previously taken.Although we did not tie ourselves down to do more thanconsult, the pronouncement had a definite implication,and people would expect consultation to be followed by action.; While he was reluctant to take any step ofthis character, he was satisfied that nothing less wouldhave any value.On a drafting point, the Prime minister thought that it would be necessary to amend the lastline of the pronouncement to read - &quot;A threat to thesecurity of the independence of any of them.&quot;    Otherwise,
it might appear that we were only interested in thesecurity and independence of European States as a whole.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said thathe appreciated the advantages of confining our approach to a limited number of States, and he recognised thatit was necessary to bring Russia into the picture, buthe asked that consideration should be given to theinclusion of Turkey-    Geographically, Turkey was abuffer between Germany and the Near and Middle East.Turkey was still a Moslem Power, and there was an advantage in having a Moslem Power associated with us.Further, Turkey had in the past shown itself to be agood friend of this country&apos;s.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had borne a number of these considerations in mind.    One point was that it was difficult to regardTurkey as one of the major Powers without causingoffence to Greece, since these two countries were apt tomove in the same orbit of European politics.    He would,however,  consider whether it was possible to take some action which would please Turkey.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out thatthe inclusion of Turkey might affect Italy&apos;s attitude.Italy would not regard the approaches to Paris, Moscowor Warsaw as being directed against her, but she might do so if Turkey were also to be approached.It was agreed that this consideration had great force.
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said that, in his opinion, perhaps the most important point was not the proposed pronouncement, hut theaction which would follow afterwards.    He was sure that his colleagues did not wish to return to the oldidea of collective security, which, in effect, meant that this country was left to find means of savingcountries against which acts of aggression were committed, while other countries looked on.    He also thought it was necessary to consider what would he the.position of our representatives in any staff conversations which might ensue after the proposedpronouncement had been made.    They would be likelyto be subjected to great pressure, designed to extractpromises from them.    He therefore asked whether itwould be possible to amend the proposed pronouncementso as to make it clear that we were determined to stop any action which constituted a threat to thegeneral security of Europe.He thought that we should be cross-examinedon the precise meaning of the pronouncement, andshould be in danger of being forced to say that wewere prepared to guarantee the independence of practically every State in Europe.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did notthink that under the formula as it stood we could resonably be asked to go so far as the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence suggested; nevertheless,he agreed that the formula was perhaps open to criticism on the grounds that it could be so interpreted.
The Prime Minister then suggested an alternativedraft declaration.      This alternative was discussed in considerable detail, and various alterations were from time to time suggested.      In its final form, thisversion read as follows:-&quot;We the undersigned hereby declare thatinasmuch as peace and security in Europeare matters of common interest andconcern, and since European peace and security may be affected by any actionwhich constitutes a threat to the. political independence of any EuropeanState, we have pledged ourselvesimmediately to consult together if itappears that any such action is beingtaken.&quot;Considerable discussion ensued in regard tothe terms of the draft declaration.     On the onehand it was urged that the main point was to securepublication of the fact that the four Powers concernedv/ere going to organise resistance to German attempts to dominate the world.     That was our main objective and it was undesirable that we should be too specificas to the nature of our collaboration or use words which would tie us down too much.     On the otherhand, it;was argued that, if we used words which leftus too free, the declaration would not inspire confidence in the very countries which it was desired to rally against the threat of german domination.     If this happened the declaration would fail in its main purpose.     To meet this point itwas suggested that the word &quot;must&quot; should besubstituted for the v/ord &quot;may&quot; in line 5 of theformula quoted above.
THE PRIME MINISTER saw objection to thisalteration on the ground that it would enable everylittle European State to call upon the four Powersto consult together in regard to what night be a trivialmatter.It was also pointed out that Poland would nodoubt be unwilling to sign the declaration until sheknew what action we would take if her. independencewas threatened.     Although it v/as agreed that ouranswer to this question need not be made public, itwas suggested that it would be essential that weshould clear our minds on the point.committee SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said!that the purpose of the declaration v/as to make itclear that we had resolved that if Germany showed thatshe intended to attempt to dominate Europe by actiondesigned to coerce a particular European State, we,in concert with other Powers, would have to take stepsto stop her.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but added that it v/as important that we should make it clear that thedeclaration did not constitute a guarantee of theexisting frontiers and of the indefinite maintenanceof the status quo.    The declaration v/as concernedwith a far wider issue, namely, security and political independence of European States against german domination.Reference v/as then made to the cases of Danzigand Memel.    Would German aggression against Danzigand Memel come within the scope of the formula?It was suggested that the test must be whether theaction proposed v/as such as to constitute a threat to the security and political independence of Poland.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he attached importfSiceto the inclusion in the formula of the word &quot;interest&quot;.Germany had on several occasions taken the line that what happened in Central and Eastern Europe was of no interest to us and it was important to make it clearthat this was not the easeaAfter discussion it was finally agreed to acceptthe alternative form of declaration quoted on page7 above.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE askedwhether it was Intended that the Staff conversations with France should be extended to include Russia and poland..THE PRIME MINISTER said that if we wereenvisaging a v/ar on two fronts he, for his part,thought that we should be wise to have Staff Conversa-tions so that we should know what action to take inthat contingency.     But he thought it was unnecessary to make any statement to that effect now. .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSenquired exactly what was meant by the phrase&quot;seems likely in existing circumstances to causeanxiety&quot; on page 2 of the draft telegram.      It was explained that this was intended to refer to roumania and was&apos; linked up with the first and second paragraphof the telegram.     In the course of the discussion the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggested thefollowing alternative wording:-&quot;... .we should propose that publication should be followed by an examination by the signatories of any specificsituation which requires, it, with aview to determining the nature ofany action which might be taken.&quot;
The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the proposal that an approach   should be made to Paris,Moscow and Warsaw only, and that adraft telegram should, be despatched to those capitals on the lines ofthe telegram circulated in CP. 75 (39),subject to the amendments shown above and. to such further minor drafting amendments as the Foreign secretary might find necessary.
,^y. 2o THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had&apos; had tinderconsideration the&apos; question whether he should address a private letter to Signor Mussolini,      During the visit to Rome the Duce had at one point asked himprevious whether there was any other matter he wished to raise,Reference .*Cabinet 11(39)     and he had said that he was somewhat disturbed as to conclusion 3).the action which Herr Hitler might take in the nearfuture.     The Duce had given him a reassuring answer,but he (the Prime Minister) had spoken to the Duceon the matter again during the last evening of the visit.      This would give him a suitable peg on which to hang what he wanted to say0He proposed to say in his letter that he was much perturbed as to the attitude of Herr Hitler; whowas now starting to include persons of non-German racein the Reich, and that this raised the whole questionwhether Germany was now seeking world domination.The Duce was probably the only person who could put the brake on Herr Hitler.      This communication, ofcourse, would be private and would not be published,and he (the Prime Minister) would be glad to knowwhether his colleagues would approve generally an approach being made on these lines, subject tosettlement of the draft between the Foreign secretary and himself.The Prime Minister added that he had considered whether, without mentioning France, he should add a word advising Signor Mussolini not to put forwardclaims in lought. aggressive manner.      He thought, however,that it was&quot;probably undesirable to include anythingon these lines-,
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he was apprehensive lest the letter mightconvey to Signor Mussolini the impression thatthe Democracies were alarmed at the position andwanted him to get them out of a difficulty.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought this difficulty was one which could be overcome in drafting the   letter, which would be a personal appeal from himself to Signor Mussolini, rather than an approach to the Head of a Government0THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had considered whether it would bepossible for the Prime Minister to write on somewhat different lines, namely, that we were friendly withthe Italians and also knew the   French very well,and that we should deeply regret it if, as the resultof Italy putting her claims forward to France ina provocative manner, Italy and France became involvedin war and we became involved, too.THE PRIME MINISTER was afraid that the appealto Signor Mussolini to exercise some restraint onHerr Hitler would lose its force if it were accompanied by any direct advice to Signor Mussolinihimself.The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the Prime Minister tosend a private letter to signor mussolini on the lines indicated,the terms of the draft to be settled by the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs in consultation.

THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESreferred to the Conclusion rea-ched by the cabinet at the previous Meeting that a Committee should beappointed to consider our Defence Programmes andtheir acceleration.     He thought it important thatthe position of agriculture should be reviewed.    he felt that action should be taken to ensure that the farmers were not short of machinery and equipment.As regards any steps to be taken to increase our production, he agreed that it would be difficult totake any action before the autumn sowings.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested, and the cabinet agreed -That the Minister of Agriculture and -Fisheries should consult with theMinister for Co-ordination Of Defence   -&apos;as regards the food productionposition in the light of the presentsituation.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,,20th March, 1939.
