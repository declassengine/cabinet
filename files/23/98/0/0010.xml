&amp; inter-ptuation.Jressfeports..3^)1-1.      THE PRIME MINISTER referred to an article which had appeared in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; onWednesday, 12th April,  to the effect that he (thePrime Minister) had received assurances from signor mussolini, through a very private source and was nowcontemplating some new Mediterranean agreement, to whichItaly would be a party.      On the strength of thissupposed message the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; had concocteda leading article which contained a bitter attack onthe Government.Fifeom enquiries the Prime Minister had ascertained that the Press Officer of the Foreign office had been aware of this rumour, and had assured thePress, both on the authority.of the Foreign Office andof the Prime Minister, that there was no truth in it.The Correspondent of the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; had, however,maintained that he had obtained this information from aCabinet Minister and had insisted on publishing it.The Prime Minister said that he had sent for theChairman     of the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; and had protested inthe   strongest possible terms as to the attitude whichhis paper had adopted in this matter.  The Chairman had given  an apology.     An article in that morning&apos;s &quot;News Chronicle&quot;however stated that &quot;reports of such a commvnicationhave received very wide circulation in the past two days ,in well informed pro-Government as well as in oppositionnewspapers&quot; and that &quot;reports of this kind are not givenpublicly in   reputable    newspapers unless received fromauthoritative      and well informed sources&quot;.     He hadlooked through a number of these papers, but had found in them no reference to this rumour.The Prime Minister said that he, of course,did not attach any credence to the report that this false
285  Ifalse rumour had been communicated to a newspapercorrespondent by a member of the Cabinet.      he understood, however, that it was a matter of someIcomplaint on the part of certain newspapers that threeiscorrespondents (whom he named) frequently hadconversations with members of the Government.The prime Minister asked his colleagues to abstain from talking to these correspondents,thereby perhaps giving rise to the impression that these particular correspondents received information that wasnot made available to representatives of other newspapers,A suggestion was made that the Prime minister might find it desirable to include in his speech in theHouse of Commons that afternoon a denial of the rumourspublished by the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;.      It was generally felt, however, that the wisest course would be to make no reference, to the action of a particular newspaper in a speech which would attract attention throughout the world.In the course of discussion, mention was madeof the fact that the British Broadcasting corporation had also published this rumour of a personal message tothe Prime Minister from Signor Mussolini, and, further,that the News Bulletins of the British broadcasting corporation frequently contained allusions and extracts from the views given by certain newspapers&amp;      In these respects the British Broadcasting Corporation news bulletins seemed to be departing from a standard ofobjectivity.The Cabinet took note of the PrimeMinister&apos;s request.
2.       THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS reminded his colleagues that theCabinet on Monday last, 10th April, hadempowered the Foreign Policy Committee to examinethe international position on lines generally approved by the Cabinet.      The Foreign PolicyCommittee had begun by examining the positionof Greece, and had reached the conclusion thatthe Statement to be made in Parliament that day should include a special reference to our interests in that country,,The Foreign Policy Committee had alsoreached the conclusion that, whilst Greece wasthe more immediate issue, it was also necessarythat we should take into account the position inregard to Roumania, which was, in essentials,part of the same problem.      In regard to bothRoumania and Greece the attitude of Turkey was regarded by the Committee as being of greatimportance.      The Foreign Policy Committee had therefore authorised the despatch of two telegrams to our Ambassador at Angora, the firstdealing with the position of Greece, and thesecond with the wider question of ensuringTurkish support for our efforts to create aBalkan bloc in support of Roumania.
The Foreign Secretary then read out tothe Cabinet telegrams Nos.  92 and 98 to Angora.(Copies of these telegrams are on record in theSecretary&apos;s standard file of Conclusions.)     Thefirst of these two telegrams embodied the proposed declaration in regard to Greece, which had been circulated to the Cabinet as CP.  81 (39),The reply (telegram Noe 119) of theTurkish Government to the former telegram had just been received, and was to the effect thatthe Turkish Government was not prepared to commit themselves to a public statement asdesired without the consent of the Chamber andwithout some more definite guarantee of theirown security.The Foreign Secretary explained thatthis reply had been despatched before the TurkishGovernment had received our telegram No. 98, inwhich we proposed that the British and turkish governments should enter into a reciprocalobligation to come to the help of each other in the event of either Power being involved ina war with Italy.     He thought that this telegramwould set at rest the Turkish Governments,doubts, but in the meantime it would be necessaryto refer in somewhat general terms to theattitude of the Turkish Government, in the statements to be made in Parliament that afternoon.
Boumania. The Foreign Secretary said that the most difficult point was perhaps the attitude of theFrench Government in this matter.     They had agreed without hesitation to the policy which we proposed to adopt in regard to the GreekGovernments but at 8.0 p.m* on the previous nightthey had telegraphed to the effect that they wished to extend the unconditional guarantee to Roumania and proposed to make an announcement to this effect on that day.      The Foreign secretary said that he had seen IvI. Corbin and told him thathe thought the French plan was a mistaken one5since it destroyed the leverage which as &quot;the resultof our pledges to Poland and Turkey2 we hope to beable to use to bring those two Powers into a widerarrangement.The Foreign Secretary pointed out thatit was impossible for us to prevent the french from making such a declaration   but if they made it and we did not act with them.; then all the evils of divergence between France and GreatBritain^ including of course the suspicion thatwe and the French are not in line9 v/ould result.The French Government appeared to attach thegreatest importance to this matter;, and to takethe view that if Roumania was left out of the.proposed arrangements3 German pressure would atonce be exerted against that country.     Afterspeaking to the Prime Minister he had again spoken to M, Corbin and sent a telegram (No.150) to Paris.He v/as afraidj however,  that the indications were that the French Government v/ould adhere to their intention to make this declaration.
In reply to the Home SecretarySy/ theForeign Secretary said that he thought if both we and the French now made the proposed declaration in regard to Roumania2 there was some likelihood that Turkey would not give any undertaking to cometo Roumania&apos;s assistance.THE PRIME MINISTER concurred in this view.,and was afraid that the proposed- declaration mightstiffen up the attitude of Roumania in regard to possible concessions in the Dobrudja to placateBulgaria.The Prime Minister added that he had seen mr. Churchill the previous day and had explained to him the situation,, and the lines on which theGovernment were acting.     Mr. Churchill had beenin complete agreement with the Governments plans which he described as hopeful.      But he fely strongly that Bulgaria had been badly treated^, andit was important that Roumania should set her house in order and make a concession to Bulgaria beforeRoumania received a guarantee from France andGreat Britain.     He had felts however  that evenif we could not obtain the assistance of Turkey and poland in this matter,, it might be necessary thatthis country-  in co-operation with France?  should give a guarantee to Roumania.The Prime Minister said that he had seen mr. Attlee on the previous day and had had asatisfactory interview with him.     He had alsoseen him again that day with Mr. Dalton.      The
Leaders of the Labour Opposition had pressed thatthe Prime Minister should make some statement inhis speech about the position of Roumanian although they did not urge that we should give Roumaniathe same pledge as we were giving to Greece.Nevertheless3  they attached importance to some statement being made which would not leave a gap in our defences.(It was decided to defer discussionpending further news of the french governments attitude. )Attitude of THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNPoland.AFFAIRS said that he had had a long talk with thePolish Ambassador on the previous day^ and atelegram had also been despatched to Warsaw two days ago to instruct our Ambassador to informColonel Beck that we were anxiously awaiting the news of the negotiations with Roumania.     Judgingfrom news which, he had had from France,, Colonel Beckhad not as yet-3 however^ made any approach to roumania on this matter.     No information had yetbeen received from the Polish Government as totheir attitude in the event of the variouscontingencies which might give rise to a warstarting in the West.Attitude of The Foreign Secretary had had half anRussia.hour&apos;s talk with M. Maisky0 and had done his best to assure him that the difficulties in regard toco-operation with Russia^, of which they were both aware? were no fault of the British Government.He (the Foreign Secretary) had been wondering whetherit would be worth while to speak very frankly toM.. Maisky on the following lines:-
He would point out that the British Governmentwere giving concrete pledges of support to various countries in the event of aggression.      He would goon to suggest that if the Russian Government wishedto be helpful, they should stop talking in generaltermsP and should say openly that they recognisedthat certain difficulties existed between them andother Powersy but they had often, expressed their willingness to give help in case of aggression, andthat they would now declare formally that if anyparticular State against which an act of aggressionwas committed desired their help9 they would do their best to give it.      He found it difficult to seeon what grounds Russia could refuse to make a statement on these lines.During discussion., the view was expressed that russia&apos;s reply to such an approach might be to saythat she had already made declarations in these terms.It was also suggested that it might be desirable tomake a special approach to M. Litvinoff in this matter in order to secure his interest.Attitude of In reply to questions, THE SECRETARY OF STATEGermany.FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that no very definite information had recently been received as toGermany&apos;s attitudes although there was the usualcrop of rumours.      It did not  however, appear that anything immediate was likely to take place.     ThePolish Government thought that there was no likelihood of any immediate German action.     Herr Hitler&apos;sfiftieth birthday fell on the 20th April and was tobe celebrated with considerable festivity.      Itappeared likely that Signor Mussolini had invadedAlbania largely on his own motion and without muchconsultation with Germany.
jttitude ofIreeoe.lbania andIhe Anglo-Italiangreement.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatofficial notification had heen received from germany that the three Deutschlands, a number of cruisers anda flotilla of destroyers and submarines and lesser vessels were to leave Germany on the 18th April for exercisesin Spanish Waters lasting about four weeks.     this appeared to be definite evidence of a detente.THE PRILiE MINISTER read out telegrams 129,130and 131 from our Ambassador at Athens.The main effect of these telegrams was thatthe Greek Government were showing signs of uneasinessat our proposed guarantee and were anxious that theimpression should not be created that the declarationhad&apos; been given as a result of previous agreement withthe Greek Government,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the vitalwords in the clause in the Anglo-Italian Agreementrelating to the status quo in the Mediterranean were -&quot;Disclaim any desire to modify or, sofar as they are concerned,  to see modifiedthe status quo as regards nationalsovereignty of territories in theMediterranean area&quot;.The offer by the Albanian Assembly of theAlbanian Crown to the King of Italy could hardly havebeen made at a more inconvenient moment.      It would,of course, be represented as a free and voluntary acton the part of the Albanian people.      It would be argued that Albanian soverignty was not impaired, andthat Albania v/ould remain a separate entity notwithstanding the union of the esown of the two countries in onesovereign.       He could not believe, however, that any of
these arguments could carry any weight with public opinion inthis country.     The offer of the crown to the King of italy would greatly aggravate public opinion and encourage those whowere pressing for the denunciation of the Anglo-italian agreement.     He thought that nothing was to be gained by attempting to minimise the force of the view that Italy had broken that Agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in view of the offer of thecrown to the King of Italy, it was no longer possible to takethe line that we should suspend judgment until we saw what  thefuture status of Albania v/as to be,THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE said that he thoughtthat nothing was to be gained by attempting to show with purelylegalistic arguments that the Agreement had not been broken.    Itwas clear that the Italian invasion of Albania was entirelycontrary to the provision of the Agreement to which the foreign secretary had referred.    He thought that, from a Parliamentarypoint of view, the most hopeful way of ensuring the maintenanceof the Agreement was to admit openly that, in our view, this action which Italy had taken was a breach of the Agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he proposed in his speech that afternoon to say, in effect, that we must await the Italianreply to the offer of the Albanian crown, but that theacceptance of this offer would not, in our view, be consistent with the Anglo-Italian Agreement.     This was tantamount tosaying that we should be fully justified in denouncing theAgreement, but that we did not propose to do so.     He thoughtthat the Labour Party were unlikely to try to force theGovernment to denounce the Agreement.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said thatwe stood to gain many advantages from the Agreement and,although we might as a result of the invasion of Albania have lost one of these advantages, it would be a pity to sacrificeall the rest.
In the course of discussion, the attitude which the Prime Minister proposed to take in regardto this matter was approved by the Cabinet.Withdrawal In reply to a question by the Secretaryof italian troops of State for India, the PRIME MINISTER said that hefrom Spain.proposed to refer in his speech to the assuranceswhich Signor Mussolini had given in regard to thewithdrawal of Italian troops from Spain.    The ItalianGovernment had now given an assurance that they would now be withdrawn after the Victory Parade in Madridon the 2nd May, and that the withdrawal should include pilots and aeroplanes.In the course of discussion it was pointedout that at first it had been stated that the troops would be withdrawn when the war was declared to be over.    This had happened some time ago, and the dateof withdrawal had now been postponed until after the victory Parade, the date of which had also been postponed.    It was also pointed out that it was unnecessary to retain all the troops in Spain totake part in the Parade.    It was-felt, however, thatthere was no action which we could usefully take to secure the withdrawal of Italian troops beyondtaking note of the assurances given and seeing what we could do to ensure their fulfilment.The Prime Minister said that he proposed tostate in the House of Commons that afternoon that HisMajesty&apos;s Government   took due note of the recentassurances which the    Italian Government had givenin regard to the withdrawal of the Italian troops from Spain, which conformed to those previously given.He proposed to make it clear that we regarded the
withdrawal of the Italian troops frora Spain as a vital element in the Anglo-Italian Agreement, and thatwe looked forward to its early fulfilment.It was generally agreed that the action ofthe Italian Government over Spain would constitute the ultimate test of whether they intended to abide by the terms of the Agreement.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR mentioned that the Italian Blilitary Attache had been to theWar Office during the last 24 hours asking forinformation under the terms of the Anglo-italian agreement as to the movement of troops in Egypt.The information had been given*    It had been pointedout that no information had been given to us, as itshould have been under the terms of the Agreement,as to the movement of Italian troops to Albania,In reply to a question, the SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that a telegram had beerreceived to the effect that the German troops would shortly be withdrawn from Spain.Roumania. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that a telegram had now been received fromSir Eric Phipps reporting the results of the representations which he had made to the FrenchGovernment in regard to the proposed guarantee to roumania (Telegram No.  164 from Paris).    The FrenchGovernment took the view that Turkey would onlyguarantee Roumania if Great Britain and France didlikewise, and they feared that unless a guaranteewas given, Germany might deliver an ultimatum to Roumania within a few hours.In discussion the SECRETARY OF STATE FORDOMINION AFFAIRS said that if France was determined to make this declaration we could not stop her, and,further, it was clear that if, as a result of France- 12 -
making this declaration, she he came involved in a war,we should have to join in with her.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that, while this declaration would result Indepriving us of one of the-leverages which we had intended to use in building up a Balkan bloc, the  losswas not perhaps quite sc serious as might appear.     we still possessed this further leverage, namely, that even if we gave a guarantee to Roumania, we shouldnot be able to afford her any effective militaryhelp unless the Balkan Powers combined to make abloc:    in other words, there would still be agreat incentive to the Balkan Powers to make an effective combination,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had always hoped that we should not find ourselves in the position in which we were now placed.    At the same time he had never had much doubt as to what our attitude should be if. weshould find ourselves in this position, namely,that we should have to act with the French.    his reasons were as follows,    First,, that if Franceinsisted on making this Aaiulai iuiy and Roumaniawas attacked, v/e should in any case be involved.Secondly, that he did not anticipate that we should get much satisfaction out of Poland on the linesof the direct approach which was to be made byPoland to Roumania,    Nevertheless,  if a war started and Roumania and both we and the French joined in,he would expect Poland would do likewise; and thesame, he thought, was true of Turkey.    Thirdly, if
our general diagnosis was correct and any further attempt at expansion by Germany or Italy meant anattempt at European domination, then we must reckonthat Roumanian wheat and oil would be of great value to Germany.    If we were to go to war, it was better to do so before Germany gained these great advantages and before there was any loss of moral in the Balkansor in the United States.    Fifthly, he stressed thedanger of any open divergence with the French.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been anxious to delay giving the proposed assurance to roumania for the reasons which had been given.    the attempt, however, to delay matters until these,negotiations could be carried through had failed.    Hewas satisfied that we could not afford to differpublicly from the French at this stage.    He proposed,therefore, that we should join with the French in giving the suggested declaration to Roumania.    he proposed, however, that we should do so with a slightdifference.    The suggested French declaration statedthat the French Government had given to Roumania a specific assurance.    We had given no such assurance to Roumania, and, further, Greece had asked us not to let it appear that she had asked for an assurance from us.    He proposed, therefore, that the assurancesto be given to both Greece and Roumania by HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be in a unilateral form;that is to say, that we should announce to the&apos;world that if aggression took place against either of thesetwo countries, and they resisted, we should come totheir aid.This course was agreed to.- 14 -
In the course of further discussion, thePRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE asked whether it wouldhe possible to make it clear,  in regard to Roumania,that the Prench and not ourselves had taken theinitiative.    This might be of assistance in rebuttingthe attempt which was now being made in Germany torepresent us as the protagonists of a policy ofencirclement.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTERthought that the French might be actuated by the motivethat, this country having taken the initiative in theproposed guarantees to Poland and Greece, M. Daladier&apos;ssupporters thought it was time that France took theinitiative and made a Statement in which this countryconcurred.The Cabinet agreed(l) To approve the line which the Prime-Minister proposed to take in his speech that afternoon, both generally,and in particular, in regard to theItalian invasion of Albania, and its effect on the Anglo-Italian Agreement;(2) To approve the proposal that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should make a unilateral declaration on the lines indicatedin CP. 81 (39) that if aggression tookplace against Greece or Roumania and thesecountries resisted, we should come to.theiraid;i(3) To approve the negotiation of a reciprocal undertaking betweenGreat Britain and Turkey to cometo the help of each other in theevent of either Power being involvedin war with Italy..
INSURANCE OF 3.        THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADEBRITISH shipping in TIME OF WAR.      referred to the Conclusion noted in the margin^(Previous when the Cabinet had authorised him to inform the reference:Cabinet 4 War Risks Association that in the event of an(39), Con-elusion 10.;       emergency breaking out after the 20th February,, 1939,the Government would give effect to the arrangements in the new draft Agreement.On the previous Tuesday the Marine Insurancemarket had been in a very unstable condition andthere was serious risk that the result would be to stop the flow of commodities to this country.After speaking to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,,who had consulted the Prime Minister, he had informed the Marine Insurance interests that theGovernment Emergency Scheme would be put intooperation.The President of the Board of Trade saidthat he proposed to announce in the House ofCommons that afternoon that in advance of legislative sanction he proposed that theprovisional scheme for the reinsurance of themarket as regards King&apos;s Enemy Risks on Cargoesto or from the United Kingdom would be broughtinto force at once.     In reply to the Chancellorof the Exchequer, he said that while it wouldano doubt5, be desirable to introduce legislation as soon as possible;,, it v/as important that such legislation should be dealt with as part of thegeneral scheme for War Risks Insurance.
MEMORIAL 4.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINIONSSRVICE TOrjtgjj LATE PRIME AFFAIRS said that a Memorial Service to the lateMINISTER OFAUSTRALIA. Prime Minister of Australia   would he held in westminster Cathedral at 12 Noon on Monday,17th April.     On previous occasions, a considerablenumber of members of the Cabinet had attendedMemorial Services of this nature.      The Secretaryof State therefore hoped that a number of hiscolleagues would be able to attend the Service.The Cabinet took note ofthis statement.Richmond Terrace, S*W.l.13th April, 1939.

Please seek urgent interview with Minister forForeign Affairs and speak to him on following lines:-2.     His Majesty&apos;&amp; Government have been, as HisExcellency will be aware, much concerned with reports thatthe Italian Government have been contemplating an attack onCorfu.   His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly informed theItalian Government that any such action would be a matter ofthe gravest concern to them (as His Majesty&apos;s Government had ascertained it would also be to France) and they have sincereceived.the most formal assurances from the Italian Governmentthat no such action is, or ever was, in contemplation.5.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken note of these assurances and propose to refer to them in Parliament onApril 15th.4. Nevertheless His Majesty&apos;s Government think it isnecessary to give a more definite assurance against Italianaggression to the Greek Government.5.     As His Majesty&apos;s Government understand the presenttreaty relations between Turkey and Greece, the former isunder no obligation to come to the aid of the latter except inthe event of aggression by a Balkan Power. - If His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government were to give to theGreek Government a specific assurance as suggested Inparagraph 4 .....
Hiparagraph 4 His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to knowwhether the Turkish Government would extend their existing obligations to Greece so that Greece might be assured of full Turkish assistance in the event of any Italian threat to Greek independence.6.     If the Prench Government agree, statement onApril 15th might include declaration in following form:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government attach the greatest importanceto the avoidance of disturbance by force or threat of forceof the Mediterranean status quo.      The events of the last few days have given rise to special anxieties as to thesituation of Greece, and His Majesty1s Government have accordingly given to that country a specific assurance thatin the event of action being taken which clearly threatenedthe independence of Greece and which the Greek government accordinly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel themselves boundat once to lend the Greek Government all support in their power.   I am happy to state that the French Government aretaking a similar attitude.&quot;7.     We should be glad if Turkish Government coould givea reply to enquiry in paragraph 5 above to reach us beforeThursday midday, as if the Turkish reply is favourable, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would wish to announce the fact intheir declaration by adding following:&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have consulted the TurkishGovernment v/ho have intimated that they concur and areprepared to adopt the same attitudef&quot;8,     For your own personal information.   If the FrenchGovernment agree, we shall in all probability announce theabove....

;ySPECIAL DISTRIBUTION.SPECIAL distribution.Cypher telegram to Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen (Angora)Foreign Office, 12th April 1959.   6.50 p.m.No.98.000000000000000000000MOST IMMEDIATE.In my telegram No.92 [of 11th April] I have set forth thelines of the approach to be made to the Turkish Government in orderto deal with the immediate menace to Greece arising out of theItalian action in Albania.2.   We must however fear that the present Italian action inAlbania may only be one step in a wider movement for the achievement of the expansionist aims of the Axis Powers, who, it is presumed,are acting in collusion.   We cannot foresee where the next point of attack will be; but whenever and wherever it is made (Greece orRoumania or Poland or Western Europe) the ultimate aim will bejoint domination of Europe by Germany and Italy.   Whichever of thesetwo Powers it is that launches the attack, it is almost certainthat the other will be involved.   This means that the next act of aggression by either of the Axis Powers whatever may be the point of attack is likely to involve directly or indirectly all the Powersbordering on&quot;the Mediterranean.5.   It must be evident that if in such a war, however it arises,the Western Powers did not emerge completely victorious, the resultmust be complete domination of the remaining States of Europe- byGermany and Italy.   If this result is to be averted, it is essential,m the interests of all, that the strongest possible barrier by thegreatest number of States should be jointly opposedto aggressive action on their part.
. -,   .   .    - i ... 2.4.   With this object in view, His Majesty&apos;s Government areprepared in principle to come to the help of Turkey in the eventof any threat by Italy, direct or indirect, to the independence of Turkey in the- Mediterranean area which is actively resisted by the Turkish Government, provided that the Turkish Governmentare prepared for their part to come to the help of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the event of His Majesty1s Government being in-volved in a war with Italy,   The precise circumstances in whichthe proposed reciprocal obligation would operate would of course have to be worked out in consultation^5.   You will be aware from my telegram Intel No. 3 [of March 30th]of the nature of the approach which His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe French Government have recently made to the Polish and roumanian Governments with a view to meeting the German menace.Among the suggestions made to the Polish Government was a proposalfor common action by. Poland with Great Britain and France in defence of Roumania in the event of any threat by Germany, director indirect, to the independence of Roumania which was activelyresisted by the Roumanian Government.   You will also have seen from my telegrams Nos.70 and 71 [of April 7th] the conclusions which were reached on this matter during the recent conversations with the Polish Foreign Minister.   The Polish Government are now,we believe, in communication with the Roumanian Government on thissubject and we await their reply.   We have kept the turkish ambassador informed in general terms of the above; but in casethe situation should not be clearly understood by the TurkishGovernment you are authorised to explain the situation to them in strict confidence in the light of the telegrams referred to aboveThis____
5. ImThis situation may develop in one of two ways:-flj(a) that Poland will not be prepared in conjunction with theUnited Kingdom and France to guarantee Roumania against german aggression,(b) that Poland will be prepared to give such a guarantee.6.   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it of the first importance that the Turkish Government should collaborate in any project ofcommon defence, and in determining what attitude they will adopt towards either of the foregoing alternatives they will be in-fluenced by an-y indication which the Turkish Government can give them as to what their (the Turkish) attitude would be towardseither of the two developments enumerated above.7.   It further appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government that in the *present situation it is most desirable to achieve the greatest possible degree of co-operation between the Balkan States and fromthis point of view the position and attitude of Bulgaria has aspecial importance.    I shall be glad to learn from the turkish minister for Foreign Affairs his estimate of the probable attitudeof Bulgaria in the situation which we are envisaging and whether in his view there are any steps which could now be taken tosecure her co-operation or, if this is impossible, at least toneutralise her opposition.8.   You should lose no time in laying the foregoing considera-tions before the Turkish Minister for Foreign. Affairs.   He will doubtless wish to consider them in connexion with the enquiry which you will have made as a result of the instructions in my telegramNo.92.   I have no desire to rush His Excellency where decisions ofsuch moment are involved.   You may therefore indicate to him thatwhile of course His Majesty&apos;s Government would be grateful to have anearly expression, of his views on the proposals contained in the pre-sent telegram, I should not wish the consideration of these matters to delay the Turkish Government&apos;s reply to the more urgent question dealtwith in my telegram No. 92.Repeated to Paris No.147,Warsaw No.94, Bucharest No.109,Athens 111Sofia No.58,Belgrade No.91, Rome No.189, Moscow No.62.
