PARLIAMENT.Arrangementsfor easter recess ..1. THE PRIME MINISTER said, that the normal procedure would be for him to announce in theHouse of Commons on Thursday the arrangements forthe Easter Recess.    The proposal was that bothHouses should adjourn on Thursday, 6th April, and.Should meet again on Tuesday, 18th April.    Itwas not usual for either House, when adjourningfor a short recess, to pass a resolution givingpower to the Lore1 Chancellor and the Speaker tocall both Houses together at an earlier date if thepublic interest should so require.The Prime Minister asked the Cabinet to considerthe following alternatives:-(l) That Parliament should adjourn for theusual recess, but that power should begiven to the Lord Chancellor and the speaker to call both Houses togetherIf an earlier meeting was required:(2) That the adjournment of parliament should be for a shorter period, namely,from Thursday, 5th April, to Tuesday,11th April.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  To approve the first course proposed,namely, that Parliament should adjournfor the Easter Recess on the 6th april and should meet again on Tuesday, 18thApril, but that power should be givento the Lord Chancellor and the Speakerto call both Houses together if an earlier meeting was required.-1-
[theJlNTERNATI ONAL(jfelTUATION.previous reference:Jcabinet 14 (39)gConclusion 2.)2 c      THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that at the Meeting of the Cabinet held on the20th Marchxit had been decided to work in favour ofa joint declaration, to be signed by Great Britain,France, Russia and Poland.      The essential point inthe declaration had been an agreement &quot;to consult together as to what steps should be taken to offerjoint resistance&quot;0     France had replied in the affirmative.     Russia had said that she would sign the declaration provided that Poland agreed to do so.Poland, however, had made a very hesitant answer.It had become clear that it would be extremelydifficult to make progress with the declaration onexactly the lines proposed.      It was also clear thattoo close an association of Russia with the proposed declaration made difficulties for a number of countries as, for example, Portugal, Spain, Japan, Italy, theSouth American countries, Canada and, according tothe French, Roumania.Although, therefore, it seemed impossible tomake progress with the declaration on precisely thelines proposed, it was none the less necessary to take effective steps to organise action against furtherGerman aggression^Continuing,  the Foreign Secretary said thatit was clear that if action was to be undertaken in circumstances at all favourable to us, or if the threat of action was to be an effective deterrent,Germany must be faced with war on two frontssimultaneously.     Poland was therefore the key to thesituation.,      In his discussions with M. Bonnet it hadbeen common ground that Poland and Roumania were inthe line of likely attack, and that steps should be- 2 - \U   H-&apos;- Wlfuh^fx   Cabinet 13 (39) Conclusion 1.
-    see. ft *v K-t^ttaken to encourage those two countries.     A draft telegram had been prepared with a view to making analternative approach to the problem.      The PrimeMinister had agreed that this matter should be consideredby the Foreign Policy Committee, a Meeting of which hadbeen held on Monday last, March 27th.      The draft conclusions of this Meeting had been circulated to theCabinet as Paper CP. 74 (59),(At this point copies of the telegrams, No. 56to Warsaw, No. 65 to Bucharest and No0 105to Paris, were circulated to the Cabinet.Copies of these telegrams are not annexed tothese conclusions, but a copy is on record inthe Secretary&apos;,s standard file of cabinet conclusions. )&apos;*&apos;The Foreign Secretary then went through the telegrams and commented on the salient points.     he explained that action would not be taken on the telegrams to Warsaw and Bucharest until the FrenchGovernment had signified their agreement,.     He referredto paragraph 4(d) and said that he realised that thisparagraph was asking a good deal of Poland, which wasthereby invited to enter into a reciprocal arrangementby which (in consideration of Great Britain and Franceundertaking to come to Poland1s help) if Great Britainor France were attacked by Germany, or, if they went to war with Germany to resist German aggression else wherein Western Europe or Yugo-Slavia, Poland would come totheir aid.     The Secretary of State said that he had felt some doubt whether this &quot;was not asking too much of Poland.He thought, however, that there would be no harm in
1 9 016 w .including the proposal in the telegram   to Warsawas he had reached the conclusion that Colonel Beckwas unlikely to reach any definite decision upon it before he visited this country at the beginning ofthe ensuing week.The position of Yugo-Slavia was one ofgreat difficulty, and he felt that it would be embarrassing to Yugo-Slavia if we were to put any veryformal or difficult proposals to her representatives.The latest information appeared to indicate that matters were somewhat steadier in regard to thatcountry.     The Prince Regent had received reassuringmessages from both Italy and Germany^The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs then referred to the position of Turkey and Greece.He did not propose to ask the Cabinet to authorisethe taking of any specific action in regard to thosecountries that morning.     Nevertheless, he thoughtit right to warn his colleagues that an occasionmight arise at very short notice in which it might become necessary for us to tell Turkey and Greecethat if they were engaged in war in the Mediterraneanwe would come to their assistance, and that weshould expect them to come to our help if we were engaged in war in the Mediterranean.     If thesituation showed signs of deteriorating it migirtbe necessary as a matter of special urgency for him toobtain the Prime Minister&apos;s authority to give suchan undertaking to the Turkish and Greek Governments.
Some discussion ensued in regard to theposition of Russia.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had endeavoured in drafting paragraph 6 of the telegram to meet the views put forward by the Home secretary at the meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee.THE PRIME MINISTER reported that he had discussed this matter with Lr. Greenwood (in theabsence of Mr. Attlee who was indisposed) on theprevious day.     He thought he had brought home toMr. Greenwood that it was of the utmost importanceto obtain the support of Poland and that it wasimpossible to secure this if Russia was broughtinto the declaration. &quot;   Certain other members ofthe Opposition   were, however, less amenable to this argument and it was likely that opposition would beraised to the Governments action from this point ofview.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY emphasised that poland was anxious that any arrangement to be made between this country and Poland should be of asecret nature.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was puzzledwhy France had not taken more definite action with Russia.     The French had an alliance withRussia and it was for them to see whether they couldnot make something more out of it.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH also emphasied theimportance of Russia from the point of view of thehome front.     He also referred to the suggestion that
had &quot;been made by the President of the Board ofTrade on the Foreign Policy Committee that there might be a separate agreement between Russia andGreat Britain to the effect that if either was attacked in Europe, each would come to theother&apos;s aid.     As Russia could not be attacked by Germany except through Poland and Roumania, thiswould not involve us in any new commitment.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought, moreover,that if Roumania signed away her independence andGermany then attacked the Ukraine this country would not be able to stand aside.      It would bemuch less provocative if this country were to associate herself with Russia at the present stagerather than to wait until such a contingency ashe had suggested took place.THE SECRETARY OF ST.--TE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he and the prime Minister had had inmind the point of view expressed by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Health.     Hethought it was clear that M. Bonnet had no great confidence in Russia.     Nevertheless, hewould consider whether it was possible to urge the French to take some further action with Russia.He agreed that it was desirable that we should try to get as much assistance from Russia as was practicable.     The essential point was to managematters so as to secure the support of Poland.At the same time he would take what steps were possible to keep in with Russia.
There was also some discussion whetherRussia would he able to supply munitions to poland and Roumania.    On the one hand, it was pointed out thatthe Polish munition areas were liable to be over-runand that there was no other possible supplier exceptRussia.    On the other hand, it was suggested that russian munitions were not likely to be of up-to-datetypes.Some discussion took place on an enquirywhether paragraph 4(a) of the telegram covered the contingency in which either Poland or Roumaniaactively resisted a threat to their independencebut the other country gave help to the aggressor.To this the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary answered that it was essential to proceed on the hypothesis that the countries concerned desiredto preserve their independence, but that they might beafraid to do so unless we promised them support.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointedout that the drafting of the telegram would perhapshave been improved if paragraph 4(d) had read as follows&quot;The undertaking given by Great Britain andFrance under (b) to Poland ,  .  .  .&quot;It was agreed, however, that the meaning ofthis paragraph was not open to doubt,THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATIONasked whether the Foreign Secretary was satisfiedthat the position would be held pending Colonel Beck&apos;arrival.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he wasconscious that these negotiations took a long time, buthe thought that the authorities in Germany realised that
this country was paying serious attention to what had happened.    He also believed that Germany would thinktwice before she involved herself in a major war.    Hehad been informed by M.  Corbin that conversationswere being carried on between representatives of Germanyand Poland in Berlin, and it was suggested that these conversations were not confined to Danzig.    It was perhaps significant that Colonel Beck had not altered the arrangements for his visit to London next week.These facts did not point to any sudden disturbance,but it was, of course,  impossible to predict thefuture.The Cabinet took note of the telegrams which had been despatched to Warsaw,Bucharest and Paris, and authorised the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary to proceed with negotiations on the general basis indicated.
DEFENCE OF THE    3. THE SECRETARY OF STATi! FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSSUEZ canal.said that the War Office had asked the consent ofthe Foreign Office to the immediate mounting for thedefence of the Suez Canal of certain gunsf.iZ,7-\ (^)) &apos;&apos;      near Port Said and Suez.    . It would take four days to mount these juns and hitherto this step had only been contemplated as part of the plan for theimmediate preparation for war as it was thought thatthe mounting of the guns was contrary to the suez canal Convention of 1851.     The effect of the last sentence of Article 8 and the last sentence ofArticle 11 of the    Convention was to provide that&quot;the erection of permanent fortifications on eitherbank of the Canal, the object or effect of whichmight be to interfere with the liberty and entiresecurity of navigation, is prohibited&quot;.The Chiefs of Staff now represented that inthe period before the guns could be mounted weshould be running a very serious risk.     It was,therefore, proposed that the Egyptian Governmentshould be Invited to take immediate steps to mountthe guns*      If this step was taken it was possiblethat Italy would lodge a complaint,,     To such a complaint we cou.ld answer (a) that the guns were notmounted on the banks of the Canal and (b) that theobject and effect would not be to interfere v/ithnavigation.     Neither answer however was thought to be wholly convincing,       Italy, however, was notin a position to compel the Egyptian Government togo to The Hague Tribunal and the worst that could
happen would therefore &quot;be a certain heating upof Italy1s claims in regard to the Suez Canal.A short discussion ensued in the course ofwhich the SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR explainedthat vital oil supplies were exposed to unnecessarydanger so long as the guns were not mounted.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that attemptsmight be made to camouflage the guns.The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to invite theEgyptian Government to take thenecessary steps for the immediatemounting of certain guns nearPort Said and Suez for the defenceof the Suez Canal0
A &amp; 9tpEECHES BYifolSTERS ONlaSIOW AFFAIRS,iprevlous Reference:aDinet 2 (39),conclusion 4.)4. THE SECRETARY OF STATiui FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the conclusion noted in the margininviting Ministers if they proposed to include,in their speeches, statements on Foreign Affairs,to submit the text of what they desired to say to theForeign Office in advance.     At the present time hewas receiving draft speeches to be made not only by Cabinet Ministers but by junior Ministers and itwas impossible for him to find time to read allthese speeches.     He asked whether Cabinet Ministers(while continuing to submit to   him their ownspeeches on foreign affairs) would be good enoughto make themselves responsible for the reading andapproving of speeches to be made by their parliamentary Secretaries,In this connection he suggested that thefollowing points should be borne in mind;   first,that this country should do all it could tostrengthen the will to resist aggression and togive support to those who are prepared to resistaggression.     Second, (not of course for publication)that it is desirable that we should gain time (a)for the progress of our Rearmament Programme, (b)for Germany&apos;s difficulties to develop.     Third, it followed that it was undesirable that language shouldbe used which suggested that we were anxious toattack Germany, since this might perhaps encourageGermany to make an immediate attack on us.
THE PRIME MINISTER suggested a furtherpoint namely that it was desirable that ministers should abstain from personal attacks on herr hitler and Signor Mussolini aThe Cabinet took note with approval ofthese suggestions.
RATIONAL SERVICE3AND DEFENCE.^previous references[Cabinet 57(38), Con-jclusion 12and Cabinet14 (39),Conclusion 3. )5. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wishedat this point In the proceedings to deal witha matter of great urgency and importance whichwas not on the agenda.There had been considerable discussion in the country on the question of Nationalf.^. l&amp;lzoj) ^.  Service, whether compulsory or voluntary, andfeeling on this matter had developed considerablyand had affected opinion in Parliament.      Therewas no wide measure of agreement on anyparticular course of action, but there was general agreement that some action should betaken in the near future.The Prime Minister said that he had given this matter his close personal attention,andafter discussing it with certain of his colleagues,had reached the following conclusion:He had a great deal of sympathy withthose who said that there was nothing whichwould so much impress foreign opinion as theadoption by this&apos;country of compulsory militaryservice.      If such a step was carried throughsuccessfully, he was sure that it would havea good effect.      His own personal view was favourable to this course, and he mentioned that many years ago, before the War and before he had entered Parliament, he had made public speeches in favour of the national servicemovement of those days, sponsored by LordRoberts.The Prime Minister next referred to thefact that he had repeated the pledge given by his predecessor to the effect that
1 t) !vhe would not introduce compulsory military service in peacetime during the life of the present Parlia-mento     As regards this s he thought that although we were not actually at wars the state ofaffairs in which wc now lived could not he described as peace-time in the ordinary meaning of the word.      The point which reallyinfluenced him was the probable attitude ofthe Labour Party and the Trade Union movement.At the present times Labour was acting veryhelpfully and was turning a blind eye to anumber of practices to which they would ordinarilyraise objection,,      All this facilitated the rapid increase in the output of munitions.,If the Government were now to propose compulsory military service3 this would result in the open opposition of organised labour and might result in strikes and a &quot;ca1 canny&quot; attitude.This would decrease output and would have adeplorable psychological effect.      It wouldbe said abroad that we had failed to secureunity or to show any real national determination.He therefore felt that it would be wrong toaccept the views of those who urged theadoption of compulsory military servicesunless it was certain that the results whichwere feared would not materialise.     Prompreliminary soundings which he had made9 hewas satisfied that it would be very dangerous to adopt this course.      At the same times itwas not possible to contemplate any delay.
It had also been represented to him invarious quarters that it was deplorable that youngmen who wished to enlist in territorial units should be turned away because the units in whichthey wished to enlist were up to establishment.The Prime Minister added that some days ago he had asked the Secretary   of State for War to submitalternative proposals for (i) compulsory militaryservice, (ii) a scheme designed to secure a large increase in the territorial force.    Since he had asked the Secretary of State for War to preparethese Memoranda^ he had come to the conclusionthat the first course was impracticable, and hehad therefore asked him to develop the secondsuggestion.    The Secretary of State for War had prepared a Memorandum the previous evening, whichhad been discussed with a number of his colleagues.The Prime Minister then asked the Secretary ofState for War to explain his proposalsoIncrease in THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thatStrength of territorial       the peace strength of the Field Divisions of theArmy.Territorial Army was 130,000.    He now proposedto raise these Divisions to the war strength,which was 170,000s and then to double the TerritorialField Army, the strength of which would thenbe 340,000.    The method followed would be toover-recruit in every unit, so as to form a cadrefrom which a duplicate unit could be built.
This course would involve a number of difficulties, which might result in criticism of the War Office.    Thus, the capacity of theexisting drill halls would be greatly over-strained until new ones could be provided.    Itwould be necessary to authorise the territorial force Association to make temporary arrangements.He hoped that it might be possible to make arrangements for utilising schools for thispurpose.There would also be difficulties in regardto instructors.    The Regular Army was in courseof being re-organised, and had already been askedto supply an increased number of instructors forthe Territorial Army.    He thought it would benecessary to re-employ retired officers andrT.C.O&apos;s as instructors.    There would also be difficulties in regard to equipment, but hethought the equipment available could be eked out for training.At a later stage it would be necessary toraise Corps and Divisional troops.    The capital cost was provisionally estimated at from  80 to 100 millions.    The annual cost had not yet been calculated, and it was impossible to say how long it would take to give effect to the whole scheme.The Secretary of State for War added thathe had also obtained the approval of theChancellor of the Exchequer to regard 18 per cent of the temporary over-recruitment approved forthe Territorial Anti-aircraft units as a permanentincrease in strength.
The Secretary of State for War then asked if it would he possible to supplement theannouncement which would he made as to the doubling of the Territorial Army by a statement relating to the Regular Army.    An increase of16,000 in the personnel of the Army had alreadybeen approved for that year, but a further 50,000was required.      He thought that it would betactically wise to include a reference to theRegular Army in the proposed announcement, andhe felt no doubt that the figure of 50,000 whichhad been submitted to the Treasury would, after examination, be approved in due course.The Secretary of State for 7/ar also referred to the National Service campaign whichwas now in progress, and suggested that the emphasis of that campaign should be altered soas to give much greater assistance to recruitment for the Regular and Auxiliary Forces.    He also suggested that the schedule of the reserved occupations should not apply to recruitment forthe Territorial Army.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtthat the questions as tQ the schedule of reserved occupations or the method of carryingout the proposed recruiting campaign could be deferred for later consideration.      He said thathe had mentioned this proposal to
Mr, Greenwood on the previous day in order toascertain whether the Labour Opposition wouldassociate themselves with the proposed increase   inthe Territorial Army.     Mr. Greenwood had saidthat it would be necessary to discuss this matter with his colleagues, but he had now sent a message to say that he was willing to ask a Private notice question,    which, he thought, indicated the LabourParty&apos;s concurrence.     He proposed to discuss thematter also with Sir Archibald Sinclair.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that thepresent proposal represented, of course, an immenseaddition to the already extremely heavy financial burden.     Nevertheless, he thought that it v/asright that he should not look at this matterprimarily from the financial point of view.     It was clear that what was needed, from the standpoint ofpublic opinion both at home and abroad, v/as someimpressive evidence of the prompt determination ofour people, expressed in some very definite form.He understood that the Foreign Secretary regardedthis matter as of the utmost importance from thepoint of view of public opinion in foreign countries,and that the step proposed v/ould operate as a severe, but unprovocative, v/arning to Germany ofour fixed determination to resist aggression.     he assumed that the Foreign Secretary v/ould considerthat this measure v/ould result in a demonstration of unity and determination that v/ould be of theutmost value to him.
It was clear that the proposal would heattended by considerable difficulties.     nevertheless it was a very big decision, and it could not possibly result in a division of opinion in thecountry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that he did not feel able to agree to an announcement beingmade as regards an addition of 50,000 men to thestrength of the Regular Army.     He doubted whether an announcement of this fact would have the samevalue, from a spectacular point of view, as theproposed announcement in regard to the TerritorialArmy.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Prime Minister had referred to theimportance in the foreign field of some practicalevidence of our determination.     There was indeedabundant evidence of this.     It was true that he would greatly have preferred a measure on somewhat widerlines, but he agreed that it would be most unwise to embark on a measure which would involve serious opposition in Labour circles.     In reply to theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s question he would saythat if the scheme was properly presented, itwould be of very great value indeed, and he was most grateful to the Secretary of State for War and to theChancellor of-the Exchequer for their parts in working out and in accepting these proposals.     In order toensure that these proposals would have the greatesteffect, he suggested that the announcement should bemade by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons,and by the Leader of the House in the House of Lords.
1 oplooThe Foreign Secretary concluded, by sayingthat he was certain that the course proposed wasthe right one and should he taken quickly.     Atthe same time he thought that we should not closeour minds to the possibility that at some later date it might be found necessary to go even further. -THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEWar Potential. referred to the Committee which had been set up bythe Cabinet at their Meeting on the 18th march to consider the Defence Programmes and theiracceleration.     The Committee had considered anumber of proposals, many of which had already been sanctioned.     The most important of all, however,was the question of war potential..     At the presenttime we were aiming at sending 4 territorial divisions overseas after six months, and the remain-ing 9 after a year; but it was quite clear that along time must elapse before even this could beaccompliehedo      Now that the Territorial Army wasto be doubled, immediate steps should be taken to double the war capacity.     Without this the whole scheme would prove a failure.Priority The Minister for Co-ordination of DefenceProposed appeal said that he had also given consideration to theto industry.steps which should be taken to ensure priority overnormal trade for munitions production, especiallyin regard to machine tools.     A number of appealshad already been made to particular industries, butthe view had been expressed that, in order to ensurethe maximum acceleration, the Prime Minister shouldbe asked to make a public appeal to all industryto give priority to all authorised orders for there-armament programme over normal trade.
Some discussion ensued on this point.      Onthe one hand the view was expressed that it was far better to deal with priority questions byspecific enquiry into individual cases or by appealsto particular industries;    and apprehension was expressed as to the possible ill effect of any generalappeal.     On the other hand it was pointed out thatcertain of the Supply Authorities and the PrimeMinister&apos;s Industrial Panel had expressed the viewthat the course proposed would have considerable advantages and that the Industrial Panel were now engaged in preparing a draft of the appeal0It was agreed that no final decisions shouldbe taken on this matter until all the ministers concerned had had a further opportunity of consideringit.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat if an appeal was made for an additional 200,000recruits to the Territorial Army and only  say 30,000were obtained, it would be clear that voluntarynational service had failed and that it would benecessary to have recourse to some other method.He suggested that the appeal for recruits should be conducted somewhat more ostentatiously than the campaign started at the beginning of the year0THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the fact thatcertain Territorial units had had to refuserecruits, had of necessity reduced the possibilitiesof advertisings
In reply to the Secretary of State for Air.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he was notvery hopeful of obtaining the full number of recruitsnow asked for within a short time*THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that the statement should make it clearthat the obligations of the Territorial Armyincluded service abroad,,After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed -(l)   To approve the proposal outlined bythe Secretary of State for War, thatthe strength of the Territorial field army should be double d:(2)    To authorise the Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for War tosettle the terms of the announcementsto be made that afternoon in theHouse of Lords and the House of Commons.
(The Postmaster-General entered the meeting at this point.)WIRE BROAD- -6. The Cabinet had. before them a MemorandumCASTING.by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(previous reference: (CP.70 (39))  covering the Report of a Sub-CommitteeCabinet 35(38), Con- of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Wireelusion 11.)Broadcasting.     The recommendations of the Sub-Committee which had been endorsed by the Committeeof Imperial Defence at their 351st Meeting are attached as an Appendix to these Conclusions.     Atthe end of his Memorandum the Minister invited theCabinet -(a) to approve the recommendationsof the Sub-Committee on WireBroadcasting set out in paragraph 32of their Report (C.I.D. paper No.314-A), including the proposal tomake an announcement in parliament on the lines submitted in recommendation(viii), the terms of which should be drafted by the Postmaster-General inconsultation with the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence.(b) to authorise the Postmaster-general to explain the Cabinet decisions tothe Governing Body of the british broadcasting Corporation at the sametime as the public statement is made.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that the Committee under the chairmanship ofthe Financial Secretary to the Treasury had pointedout that the cost of providing wire broadcastingon a scale which would enable wireless broadcastingto be closed down altogether in war warn fabulous.Nevertheless,   the Committee thought that efforts should be made to encourage wire broadcasting.
This could he done in three ways:    First, by theextension of the licences of the existing relay companies for the period, of ten years.      Secondly,by the Post Office instituting a service over the telephone network on a self-supporting basis.Thirdly, by assisting the Electricity Industry toobtain permission to grant powers to the relay companies to use their lines on rental terms.The Report of the Committee had beenapproved by the Committee of Imperial Defence.As regards the British Broadcasting Corporation, itv/as thought that the right course was that theCorporation should be informed of the decision reached by the Government.THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL said that the relay companies were not authorised to originate messages,but they might be required to do so In an emergency.The question had now arisen whether they might notbe required to send messages for A.R.P. purposesbefore an emergency had arisen.     If it v/asdecided that this should be done, a reference tothe fact should be included in the proposed public announcement.It was agreed that this point should be taken up Departrnentally.The Postmaster-General also emphasised&apos;theimportance of making a very early announcement on the decision reached, since, until such anannouncement was made, the Relay Companies would take no action.     He proposed, therefore, to make an announce-ment, in the terms which had been agreed with the Minister
(At this point the Postmaster-Generalleft the Meeting).for co-ordination of Defence, on the following afternoon and to communicate with the governors of the British Broadcasting Corporation immediately thereafter.The Cabinet agreed to approve the recommendations madein the Memorandum submittedby the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence (C?o70 (39)) summarised above.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs and hehad been asked to advise on matters which affected the Judge Advocate of the Fleet, andthey had been averse from expressing iews about   other   matters    in   the   Report.At the same time,    they felt that certain points in the Report were not perhapsaltogether logical or wise. If theReport were now to be published, without any government statement, he thought that theGovernment might run a risk of findingthemselves committed to putting the judge advocate General in a position which in his(the Lord Chancellor&apos;s) view he ought not to occupy.After further discussion, it wasagreed:-(l) To defer publication of theReport of the Courts-martial committee.i(2) That a Cabinet Committee comprising the Lord Chancellor (in the Chair)The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.and The Financial Secretary to theTreasury.should be set up to consider theReport of the Army and Air force courts-Martial Committee, and recommend what action should betaken thereon and in regard to theposition of the Judge Advocateof the Fleet.

APPENDIX.[C.I.D. Paper No. 314-A]Recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Wire Broadcasting.The following are our recommendations : (i) The development of a wire broadcasting service on a nation-wide scalewithin two or three years could only be achieved by the provision ofthe service free and the assumption by the Post Office of responsibilityfor the development. This course, which would involve a capitalexpenditure of some  100,000,000 and annual charges of some millions of pounds, cannot be regarded as a practical proposition (para-graphs 3-5).(ii) The present short-term arrangements for wireless broadcasting in time.of war must also be regarded as the intermediate-term arrangements,subject to such modifications as may result from further investigationor technical development (paragraph 5).(iii) In view of the great advantages of a wire over a wireless system in theevent of war, every method of encouraging its development in peace without subsidy from the Exchequer should be adopted (para-graphs 7-10).(iv) Development should be effected (paragraph 11) (a) through the expansion of the services at present provided by RelayExchange Companies;(b) through a Post Office Service over the telephone network.(v) Relay Exchange Companies.(a) Licences for existing Companies should be extended for 10 years to the 31st December, 1949 (paragraph 12), subject to conditionsregarding programmes, connection by wire to stations of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation, purchase by the Governmentand control in an emergency, set out in paragraphs 13-16, 17,18 and 19 respectively.(b) Licences for new Companies should be terminable at the same date and be subject to the same conditions as in the case of existing companies (paragraph 12).(vi) Post Office Service over the Telephone Network.(a) The service should be introduced first in districts most favourable to success, and should be restricted, in the first place, to telephone subscribers; but a reference to its possible extensioneventually to non-telephone subscribers should be included inthe initial announcement (paragraphs 20-22).(b) The service should be operated on an economic basis withoutsubsidy, probably at a cost to the subscriber of 25s. to 30s. perannum (paragraph 23).(vii) Electric Light Network. The Government should be prepared to assistthe electricity supply industry to obtain powers to grant permission to any licensed Relay Company to use their lines on rental terms forthe transmission of broadcast programmes (paragraphs 24-26).(viii) An announcement of the scheme for the development of wire broad-casting should be made in Parliament as soon as possible andshould contain an indication that, whilst it is the intention ofthe Government to maintain wireless broadcasting in time of war, theservice would be liable to some deterioration or occasional interruptionas a result of enemy jamming or other interference (paragraph 27).[18777]
$        11   rl        n__:SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION.Cypher telegram to Sir E. - Phipps (Paris),Foreign Office, 27th March, 1959.   11.CO p.m.Mo. 105.BJMEDlATlSECRET..4-As you will see from the record of the conversation whichthe Prime Minister and I had with the French Minister for ForeignAffairs on March 25rd, the two- Governments reached generalagreement on the best course of action to adopt in view of the reluctance of the Polish Government to accept the proposed Four-Power declaration of consultation.,2.   The draft instructions contained in my telegrams to .Vi-warsaw Ho. 56 and to Bucharest Mo. 65 have &quot;been prepared in thelight of our discussions with Monsieur Bonnet.   You should give him a.copy of those instructions and enquire whether he would be disposed to send similar instructions to the French Ambassadorsat Warsaw and Bucharest.   It is important that the British andFrench representatives at each capital should consult each otherbefore taking action, and that they should act at about thesame time.3.   You will see from my telegram under reference that it is contemplated that the Soviet Government, while not associateddirectly with the proposed arrangements, should be kept in touchwith developments and invited to undertake to lend their assistancein certain circumstances in the most convenient form. I hope thatthe French Government would cooperate with us in endeavouring tosecure this from the Soviet Government.4.   It is of the first importance that the character of the approach which His majesty&apos;s Government and the French Governmentare making in Warsaw and Bucharest, and the communications whichmay follow it, should be kept secret, since any premature dis-closure would jeopardise their success.Repeated to Warsaw No. 57, Bucharest No. 66 and Moscow No.54. .
&apos;Special DISTR/bui I DIM?.SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION,Cypher telegram to Sir H- Kennard (Warsaw). No. 56,-Sir&quot;R7&quot;Hbafe (Bucharest), No. Bo,Foreign Office, 27th March, 1959.   11.30 p.m.IMMEDIATE.(No action should he taken on the present telegrampending further instructions).1.   My enquiries in the various capitals concerned haveshown that it will not be possible to proceed without modifica-tion with the proposed Four-Power declaration.   While the FrenchGovernment have accepted the proposal, and while the SovietGovernment have accepted, subject to acceptance by France and poland, the Polish Government are reluctant, for reasons which I appreciate, to associate themselves with the Soviet Union in apublic declaration of this kind.2.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have been in close and confidential consultation with the Polish Government on thissubject, and although possible variants of.the original schemehave been discussed, it is becoming clear that our attempts to consolidate the situation will be frustrated if the Soviet union is openly associated with the initiation of the scheme.   recent telegrams from a number of His Majesty1s missions abroad havewarned us that the inclusion of Russia would not only jeopardise the success of our constructive effort, but also tend to consolidate the relations of the parties to the anti-CominternPact, as well as excite anxiety among a number of friendlyGovernment.
5.    It is evident, therefore, that some alternative methodof approach must &quot;be sought.   In any scheme, the inclusion ofPoland is vital as the one strong Power bordering on Germany inthe East, and the inclusion of Roumania is also of the first importance, since Roumania may he the State primarily menacedby Germany&apos;s plans for Eastern expansion.4.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore, decided tomake an approach to the Polish and Roumanian Governments inthe following sense.   The French Government have agreed to makea corresponding approach.(a) Germany may either directly attack Poland or Roumania, or may undermine either country&apos;s independence, whether by processes of economic-penetration or national disintegration, as in the caseof Czechoslovakia, or by indirect military pressure, which, inthe case of Roumania, might take the form of Hungarian troop concentrations.   Are Poland and Roumania respectively preparedactively to resist if their own independence is threatened in anyof these ways?(b) If so, Great Britain and France would be prepared to cometo the help of the threatened State.   It would be understood that,as a counterpart for the undertaking by Great Britain and france to support Poland and Roumania, Poland and Roumania would keepGreat Britain and Prance fully and promptly informed of anydevelopments threatening their independence;(c) The assurance offered in (b) is dependent upon Polandcoming to the help of Roumania, if the latter is the Statethreatened.   We should wish to know whether Roumania would beprepared to come to the help of Poland if the latter were theState
State threatened..(d)(The present section (d) of the communication is to he made to the Polish Government only, since Poland, unlike Roumania,has a treaty of Mutual Assistance with France, and is a strongermilitary power than Roumania).     The undertaking given by GreatBritain and France under Co) would he given as part of a reciprocal arrangement by which if Great Britain or France were attacked by Germany, or if they went to war with Germany to resist German aggression anywhere in Western Europe or Yugoslavia,Poland would come to their help,5c   If the position of Poland and Roumania can beconsolidated, Turkey and Greece could more easily be rallied tothe common cause and would be more likely to be able to make an effective contribution^6.   It is important that the Polish and RoumanianGovernments should be made aware of the manner in which we would propose to deal with the Soviet difficulty.   It is desirable to preserve the interest&apos;of the Soviet Union in this schemeB   Theintention would be, at some&quot;convenient moment in the discussions,to explain to the Soviet Government that it was proposed in thefirst place to proceed with the Governments of the two countriesnearer to Germany and.most likely to be affected by the potential danger of the situation,   In the event of an attack on Poland orRoumania there would be good reasons on the merits of the case for trying to secure some measure of Soviet participation.   Ibelieve that even the benevolent neutrality of the Soviet union would be to the advantage of these two countries in case of war,and that they might indeed be grateful in an emergency to have at their disposal such war material- as Soviet industry would bein
1r ijin a position to furnish.    I am disposed in the first place toascertain the view.of the Soviet Government as to their likely-attitude to this proposalo   It is important not to reinforcetheir tendency towards isolation and I propose to consider indue course how best to retain their close interest which is,after all, to their own general advantage.7.    It is essential of course that the present approach tothe Polish and Roumanian Governments should be kept secret, aswell as any negotiations that may follow it,,   Once howeveragreement had been seoured, it would be necessary, for consti-tutional reasons, that some statement should be made in Parliament.His Majesty&apos;s Government would at any rate have to state in public the assurances which they had given to the Polish and roumanian Governments.   It is possible that the Polish government might be reluctant to agree to make public such counter-assurancesas they would have given to us, but His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould certainly be pressed to say whether any such counterassurances had been given and they would very much hope to bein a position to announce the facto8&apos;.   Your French colleague will receive similar instructions and. you should, after consulting him, speak, to the Minister forForeign Affairs in the sense of the present telegram.   You shouldnot leave with him any statement in writing.Repeated to Paris No. 164 and Moscow No. S3.
