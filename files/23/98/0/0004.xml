SPAIN.international committee fopthe applicationof the Agree-ment regardingHon-lnt er v en ti onin Spain.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(59)Conclusion 2.X. THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that an indication had been received thatGermany and Italy proposed to discontinue further payments to the Non-intervention Committee.The Earl of Plymouth and Mr. Francis Hemming,the Secretary of the Non-intervention Committee,had reached the conclusion that it was now necessaryto wind up the Non-intervention Organisation. &apos;   He(the Secretary of State) proposed that steps shouldbe taken to this end.     He thought that the cabinet should be aware of the position.The Cabinet took note of and approvedthis statement.
THE INTER- 2. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRSNATIONALSITUATION. said that after the Meeting of the Cabinet on 20th MarchGeneral. he had shown the draft declaration, in confidence, to(Previous the French Ambassador, who had expressed considerableReference:Cabinet 13(39) concern at the terms of the declaration as drafted,Conclusion 1)which he thought would create the impression that thef,f%. powers were no-t disposed to take any action andwould only talk when a new threat arose.     Mo Corbinhad been particularly afraid of the possible effectof the declaration as drafted on Colonel Beck, who,he thought, would conclude that his country could look for no material assistance from the Western Powers.After speaking to the Prime Minister, he (the SecretaryOf State) had therefore altered the latter half of theformula to read:-&quot;Our respective Governments herebyundertake immediately to consult together as to what steps shouldbe taken to offer joint resistance to any such action&quot;.Copies of the telegram had also been sent to theGovernments of the Dominions and to the United StatesGovernment.Up to the present no replies had been received,but it was possible to give some indication as tothe attitude of the other Powers.As regards France, he was proposing to have some further discussion with M. Bonnet in the course ofthe day.     The general French reaction was favourable.Poland had not yet replied, and the Frenchthought that Poland&apos;s attitude would be rather difficult.It appeared that the French had already made somewhat similar proposals to the Polish Ambassador in Paris.The Egyptian Ambassador had also expressed the viewthat Poland would, for the time being, continue to occupy a middle position.- 2 -
At the previous Meeting of the Cabinet enquirieshad been made as to the relation between the Franco-Polish Treaty and the German-Polish Treaty.      TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that theposition  was that there was nothing in the German-PolishAgreement which need prevent Poland from working with us if Poland so desired, but that this Agreement would givePoland a good excuse if she did not wish to co-operate with us.     The Polish Ambassador had informed the foreign secretary that if Germany attacked France, Poland would come to the assistance of France;   but he (the foreign secretary) feared that if Germany attacked roumania and in consequence France declared war upon Germany,Poland might stand aside0     It was worth rememberingthat the Polish-German Treaty was without prejudice to poland&apos;s existing legal engagements.It seemed clear that the French regardedRoumania as the key to the situation.     Mo Bonnet had saidthat France would go to war to save Roumania, but he kepton emphasising that Poland&apos;s attitude was of capitalimportance.Our Minister at Bucharest had seen King Carol, whohad assured him that while there was much in the demands made by Germany in the economic discussions that wasunpalatable, there had been no question of an ultimatum.It seemed that M. Tilea, the Roumanian Minister inLondon, had general instructions to ensure an activeinterest in Roumanian affairs on the part of His majesty&apos;s government, and he appeared to have somewhat exceeded hisinstructionsoTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theRoumanian attitude seemed to indicate that, she didnot wish Germany to become too angry.
Russia.    THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that M. Litvinoffseemed to be somewhat perturbed that we had not been more enthusiastic over his proposals for a conference.As regards relations between Hungary and roumania, it appeared that there was still a gooddeal of mutual suspicion between the two countries,and it was uncertain how far Hungary was prepared toplay the German game.     The Egyptian Ambassador had informed the Foreign Secretary that his impression was that if Great Britain, France, Russia and the balkan States showed a united front9 they would stopHerr Hitler even without the support of Poland.      TheEgyptian Ambassador thought that Herr Hitler was out for a bloodless triumph.Turkey.    The Turkish Ambassador had given theForeign Secretary information as to the attitude ofthe Turkish Governments which he had explained didnot represent a decision taken by that Governmentin the light of the happenings of the last few days,but was a fixed policy which had been decided uponbefore he (M. Aras) had left Turkey.     The situation was that the Turkish Government were quite satisfied with all their existing treaty arrangements and quitedetermined to fulfil all their obligations under them.But before accepting any further commitment, and before departing from neutrality3 the TurkishGovernment would wish to be reassured on two points.The first was, generally, would they have GreatBritain with them?   The second was, more particularly9if they were attacked in the Mediterranean would theyhave the benefit of direct British assistam.ee?M. Aras explained that once satisfied on these two points there was no other question that would present
any difficulty9 and zhey would be prepared to go toall lengths with Great Britain.     At present9 incertain circumstances they would, under their treatyarrangements9 be neutral9 but in any event they would only depart from neutrality if they were on the sameside as Great Britain.The Secretary of State said that the cabinet would have read the information published in that morning&apos;s newspapers about the situation in Memel.This information was in advance of the official information that we had so far received? but itwas probably true that an Anschluss of Memel withGermany was to be expected.     There was? of course,more justification for this course than for certainrecent events.In reply to a question as to Italy&apos;s attitude,the Foreign Secretary said that evidence wasaccumulating that Signor Mussolini was angry at theway in which he had been treated by Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the french president had spoken optimistically about Italy,but he had conveyed to him no definite Information.He (the Prime Minister) had been disappointed to seethe resolution which the Fascist Grand Council were stated to have passed.     It seemed clear that theItalian papers had orders to support the continuanceof the Berlin-Rome axis.As regards other matters the Prime ministers aid that the impression left on his mind as to the-probable attitude of both Poland and Russia was somewhat disagreeable.
In further discussion, the FOREIGN secretary said that the general opinion was that Poland would fightif Roumania was attacked.     His general impression hadbeen that Russia would adopt the same course, but that the feelings between Roumania and Russia were far from cordial.He thought that if M. Litvinoff attached considerable importance to his proposed conference, it might benecessary to see whether we could not get somewhat closer to the Soviet point of view in this respect.In reply to a suggestion that Turkey should beasked to attend such a conference, THE PRIME minister pointed out the supreme importance of bearing in mindItaly&apos;s point of view.     If Turkey were included in theconference, Italy would certainly regard the conference as directed against her interests.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat Canada and New Zealand had fastened on the statement made by the Prime Minister in his Birmingham Speech as to consultation with the Dominions and Democratic Nations.The Dominions were well satisfied with the information which they had received, but they were now beginning tothink in terms of specific consultation.     Both Canada andNew Zealand had made considerable advances on what theyhad previously undertaken to do in the way of co-operation,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the reference tothe Dominions in his Speech had not been intended to be a prelude to some new form of consultation.    It wassuggested that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsmight ask our High Commissioner in Canada to ascertain what
fhe UnitedI states.Mr. Mackenzie King had in mind in this respect.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, during a conversation with the american ambassador the previous evening regarding the AmericanNeutrality Act, he (the Foreign Secretary) had pointedout what a help it would he to us vis-a-vis Japan if,in the event of trouble breaking out, part of the UnitedStates Fleet could be sent to Honolulu.     Mr. Kennedyhad received this suggestion enthusiastically and had promised to suggest it to President Roosevelt.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat later in the evening he had discussed this projectwith Mr. Kennedy who, at that time, had seemed a trifleless enthusiastic and had not been prepared to discussthe matter further than to say that he intended to proposethat the U.S. Fleet should be brought to a state ofpreparedness.The Cabinet took note of the statement made bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
SECTIONS.previous reference:cabinet 13(39)conclusion 3.)&quot; 1^        W.5.     THE PRIMS MINISTER said that in the courseof the previous two days, he had had consultations withthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and withthe Service Ministers as to the state of our defencepreparedness^     As a result, certain steps had beentaken.Our air defence ground organisation (a.a.guns andsearchlights) had been based on the assumption thatwe should have at least IS hours&apos; warning.      If thematter was considered from the point of view of a sudden air attack without warning, the position wasvery disturbing and we were totally devoid of grounddefences against air attack.T-here was the further point that the organisationof the Territorial Antiaircraft Divisions \r/asintended to secure a rapid deployment of the wholeForce, but that, first, it was very difficult to deploy a part only of the Force and, secondly, that once the Force had been deployed and had been allowed to disperse, a considerable period must elapse before it could again be rapidly deployed.The Prime Minister thought that this aspect of our defence preparations would have to be looked into again with a view to ensuring greaterreadiness to meet a sudden attack.     He had alreadyasked the Minister for Co-ordination of defence and the Secretary of State for War to look into thematter.     The Prime Minister then asked theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence to explain the steps which had been taken to deal with theimmediate situation.
Tins mi:.:ist:jr for oo-ORDf:.uo?ion of de:;;lttce saidthat the guns which we were now considering were thosemanned by the Regulars, and which formed part ofthe Field Force.     Excluding guns for defence againstlow-flying attack, there were 72 A.A. guns aianned byRegulars.     Some of these had recently been brought from Lichfield to London and the rest were atAldershot.      It had now been arranged that all theseguns should be deployed in the course of the day inthe London area.     As regards searchlights,  there were48 searchlights manned by Regulars at Aldershot,These were being brought up and would be deployed inthe London area in the course of the day.     Thesesearchlights could be supplemented by making arrange-ments for searchlights in certain of the Territorialdrill halls in London to be available to operate ata moment&apos;s notice.     It was also proposed to make arrangements to move ammunition to the war sites of32 static 3.7&quot; guns which had already been mountedin the London area,     These guns were manned byTerritorials but this arrangement would enable theseguns to be manned at very short notice.With regard to the Roj&amp;l Air Force, theposition was that a duty flight of 6 machines wouldbe available to take to the air at 15 minutes&apos; notice in each Fighter Sector.Discussion then ensued as to the steps whichshould be taken to improve the machinery fordeployment and the organisation of the Air Defenceof G-rea/fc Britian which was too slow for modern conditions.
ISOTIE) PRIME MINISTER said that so far as he could see the only way to deal with the matter would he tohave a proportion of our ground defences manned byRegulars.THE SECRET. RY OP ST....TE FOR WAR asked whether itmight not be possible to deal with the scheme by meansof a system such as that adopted in Switzerland wherebyevery uian v/as under obligation to serve the State fora specified period in every year.     This system had moreelasticity and v/ould enable a certain number of men tobe made available at any period.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought that ascheme on these lines might be worth exploring.     he added that he had information that a meeting of the TradesUnion Congress, the Parliamentary Labour Party and theNational Council of Labour v/as to be held that afternoon.It seemed possible thut, provided satisfactory assurances   jcould be given as to our foreign policy, these bodieswould be prepared to support the Government openly, subject only to the reservation that they would not supportconscription.In the discussion which ensued, the Prime ministers aid that in his view, unless there was a very markedchange in their opinions, the Labour Party v/ouldcontinue to oppose conscription strongly.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said thathe did not think that the Defence Ministers or the Chiefsof Staff had ever considered what advantages v/ould be derived from conscription.     The general feeling that conscription would add greatly to our military strength-needed, of course, a great many qualifications.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would welcome such an enquiry.The Cabinet took note of the statements madeby the Prime Minister and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.- 10 -
FOREIGNPOLITICALORGANISATIONSIN THE UNITEDKINGDOM.(previous reference:Gabinet3o(37), Con-clusion 7).4.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME. affairs said that his colleagues would he aware that thismatter had previously been discussed in theCabinet, but that it had been decided to taice no action because of the possible political reactions.It was clear that there were a number of Germansnow in London whose e^*e employment was inconnection with the activities of foreign politicalorganisations.    In the opinion both of the police and of the Military Intelligence Authorities, theposition would be much more secure if three orfour of the leaders of these organisations wereto be deported.    He iwopogied to take this step in regard to the officials of the Naziorganisations, but not to take similar action inregard to the Fascist organisations.    He askedwhether the Cabinet would be prepared to leave thePrime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and himself to authorise such action as they might decide wasnecessary in consultation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN.AFFAIRS said that at the present time there were61 officials of Nazi organisations in thiscountry.    He was disposed to favour action onthe lines proposed in regard to persons who were found to be engaged in undesirable activities.He thought that on the whole this was a good timeto take this step, since our relations withGermany could hardly be worse than they were atpresent.    It v/ould be a pity to postpone actiontill a later date when our relations might beimproving.
The Cabinet agreedThat the Prime Minister, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for Home Affairs,acting in consultation, should heempowered to authorise action witha view to the deportation of a limited number of officials of Nazi organisationsin this country who were engaged inundesirable activities.
PALESTINE.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(39), Con-clusion 5. )AO5.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE colonies said that the formal Conferences had come to anend on the previous Friday (17th March).    TheJews had rejected the Government&apos;s proposals ona number of counts.    The Palestinian Arabs hadostensibly rejected the Government&apos;s proposalswholesale and had adhered to their original views.In fact, however, it appeared that we should havehad a very good chance of reaching agreementwith the Palestinian Arabs but for our refusal toput a definite time limit to the transition period.The Palestinian Arabs had thought that the failure to put a time limit on the transition period would have the effect of encouraging the jews in an attitude of non-co-operation.One unfortunate and unexpecteddevelopment the previous week had been that when*at the final meeting, the Palestinian Arabs had rejected the proposals, the Iraqi Delegate had atonce aregggagaaaaafc said that he likewise entirelyrejected the proposals.    Following on thisunforeseen result the representatives of the    ,/   &amp;      \Yemen, Trans Jordan and Saudi-Arabia had **aJc*rather unfortunate speeches condemning theGovernment&apos;s proposals.    Only the EgyptianDelegate had behaved really well on this occasion.Although the representatives of the neighbouring Arab States had taken this attitude0arn*4. fit. &quot;fk&amp;4**-in public, behind the scenes sbaey had told us that they regarded our proposals as wise and reasonable.    For example, the representative ofTransJordan, himself a Palestinian Arab, had said
that if we announced our proposals now, therewould he a temporary increase in rebellious activity,after which the rebellion would collapse.    Itwould, however, take longer to bring acts of individual terrorism to an end.The position had, of course, been affected by the European situation, and con-sideration of the draft White Paper by thePalestine Committee, which was to have been published that day, had been postponed.One argument in favour of some delaywas that the United States Ambassador had been authorised by his G-0vernment to urge us to delay the announcement of our policy.    The reason far this presumably was that it v/as thought atWashington that if our policy was published now,the Jews would be able,, to work up an agitation against us which might have an effect on thediscussion of the amendment of the AmericanNeutrality Laws.    Another reason for delay wasthat the discussions with the representatives ofthe neighbouring Arab States about the transition period had been revised.He had gone some way to meet the Arabpoint of view on this and he hoped to find a formula which, without committing us to a givenperiod of years for the transition period, wouldnot enable the Jews to hold up constitutional progress by a refusal to co-operate with the Arabs.It was possible that he might be in a position tosubmit proposals to the Palestine Committee inthe course of the next few days.    It was clear
that notwithstanding that there were reasons forsome delay in issuing a statement of our policy,it was essential that we should make up our minds as to what was in fact our policy in regardto Palestine, and should announce it in, say, thenext two or three weeks.    The Jews, however,were working up a considerable agitation and asking that our    decision   on policy should be postponed for six or twelve months.The developments in the international situation could not of course be ignored.    It was of the utmost importance to consider whether itwas not possible for us to meet the Arab objectionsto our proposals.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that he was glad to hear that these points were being further considered.    It had alwaysseemed to him that the constitutional arrangementscontemplated were open to the criticism that progress on the constitutional issue might be postponed through no fault of the Arabs butthrough the failure of the Jews to co-operate with the Arabs.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies said that it had always been made clear that thefailure of the Jews to co-operate would not delayprogress during the transition period.    TheGovernment had, however, taken the view that thefinal establishment of the independent Araflfr state must depend on the Jewish and Arab communitiesbeing ready to work in co-operation.The Cabinet agreed -To take note of the statement madeby the Secretary of State for theColonies.
hiCIVILSIENCE$ILL.ceviouaMabinet 10 (39)Mpnclusion 7.)6.     The Cabinet had before them the&quot; following-do cuments:-A Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal(haA. 13 (39)) covering a draft civil defence Bill dated 10th March, 1939;The 6th Conclusions (39) of theCommittee of Home Affairs (item 4):The 7th Conclusions (39) of theCommittee of Home Affairs, to whichwas attached a new draft Bill dated20th March, 1939,The recommendations to the Cabinetby the Committee of Home affairs were as follows 1-(1)    To approve the Civil Defence Bill inthe form of the draft dated 20th March, 1939,subject to:-(a) the reservation by the Chanoellor ofthe Exchequer of his position inregard to Clause 15 (7);(b) the various additions, deletionsand other modifications made tothe Bill by the Committee at their meetings on 13th and 20th March,as summarised in H.A.C. 6thConclusions, Minute 4, and in thepresent Conclusions:    and(c) any further drafting or other minor alterations that may be foundnecessary or desirable.(2)    To authorise the introduction forthwith inthe House of Commons of the Bill in theform as finally settled, with a view to its passage into law as soon as practicable,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Chief Whipwas very anxious that this Bill and the Building-societies Bill should be circulated as soon as possible.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that a number of provisions of the Bill were of a very serious character and gave very wide powers to the Minister.     He was satisfied, however, that it was necessary that theMinister should have these powers in the circumstances which now existed, and the whole Bill had been very carefully considered and criticised.
5EHE LORD PRIVY SEAL then went through theBill, calling attention to the most important points.The chief points dealt with were as follows:Clause 15.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explainedthat there was an extremely complex point, in regardto income tax, which arose on Clause 15, and whichmight need some adjustment.The Cabinet agreed to accept either thescheme set out in the present draft or some substitute therefor to be agreed between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Lord Privy SealoIt was provided in Clause 17 that exchequer grants should be made in respect of work on shelterscompleted by 51st March, 1940, or substantiallycarried out by that date.     The Prime Minister&apos;industrial Panel thought that this date was too late,and that an earlier date should be substituted in theBill as published.      The LORD PRIVY SEAL asked theCabinet&apos;s authority to substitute 30th September, 1939,for 31st March, 1940oThis was agreed to&amp;In regard to Clause 24, the Lord Privy Sealexplained that this Clause was being redrafted so asto confine the powers to be conferred to him more closely to matters relating to civil defence.      Thepoint had also been raised in regard to this sectionthat as the Clause at present stood, the minister would have power to make regulations dealing with matters affecting public utility companies.     he proposed to insert a new provision whereby so far aselectricity generating stations were concerned, thepowers should be exercised by the ElectricityCommissioners, subject to consultation with theMinister for Civil Defence.
THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT said that as theClause was at present drafted, Local Authorities wouldhave powers., to interfere with essential services.It was agreed that the points arising onthis Clause should be settled by the lord privy Seal and the Minister for transport in consultationcIt was also agreed that certain points arising on Part V of. the Bill in regardto the agreement made with the DockUndertakings should be settled by the lord privy Seal and the Minister for transport in consultation.Clause 40.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL explained that this Clausedealt with property requisitioned in anticipation of animmediate emergency.     He thought that it was clear thatsuch cases must be dealt with as part of the general war-time problem., and the terms of compensation left tobe settled by the Government of the day.     He was satisfied, however, that it was necessary that buildingsshould be made available quickly and that it wastherefore necessary that Departments should have these powers in anticipation of an emergency.The Cabinet agreed as to the need for these powers, although it was pointed out that it would benecessars^ to provide compensation very soon afterproperty had been requisitioned.     Such compensationmight well have to be provided on an interim basis.If the property was requisitioned in anticipation of an emergency and no emergency ensued, then the action taken would presumably be dealt with under peace-timecompensation powers.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL explained that as aresult of discussion which had taken place on theprevious day, he must now ask for the powers ofrequisitioning included in Clause 40 to be extended to transport.     It might be necessary to requisition and
adapt transport for fire brigades and ambulances.THE MINISTER 01:&apos; TRANSPORT said that he agreed to this course, subject to the consent of the traffic Commissioners being obtained in regard tothe transport to be requisitioned,,The proposed addition to Clause 40 was approved,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION APPAIRSenquired whether the powers under the Defence of the realm Act would be affected by the powers sought inthis Bill.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that for the mostpart the powers asked for in the Civil Defence Billrelated to peace-time, but he undertook to look intothe matter.The Cabinet agreed?To approve the recommendations of theHome Affairs Committee set out above and to authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of commons of the Bill in the form as finally-settled subject to the points referred to in the Cabinet discussion,which should be settled by theMinisters concerned in consultation.
shippingIdustry.peviousiference;cabinet 1 (39)Inclusion 7.)lb.7*     The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(CP. 67 (39)) on the question of Assistance tothe Shipping Industry, in which he made certain recommendations for adoption by the Cabinet.     these recommendations were the result of the deliberationsof the Cabinet Committee appointed at the meeting mentioned in the margin and of the subsequent discussions between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand himself.     These recommendations are reproduced in the Appendix to these Conclusions.     In the eventof their adoption, legislation would be required of which the details would need a considerable amountof working out, in consultation with the Shipping-Industry.     The President asked for authority to makea statement in the House of Commons on general lines,in order that there might be no avoidable delay in the placing of orders for new ships.     For this purpose,it would be necessary to say that when legislation was introduced the House of Commons would be asked,so far as assistance for shipbuilding was concerned,to agree that orders placed after his announcement,but before the passing of the Act, would not be excluded from consideration for this assistance.After THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP trade had expounded the principal points in his Memorandum,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he acceptedthese proposals, though with some reluctance, havingregard to the undesirability of granting subsidies.He asked, however, that before the President of theBoard of Trade made any announcement as to theposition, he should first see the representatives ofthe steel and shipbuilding industries with a view to securing some reductions in their prices in
consideration of the financial assistance, which itwas now proposed to grant to the shipbuilding industry.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE agreed,and said that he had already made arrangments to seethe representatives of these industries this week.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR asked the Presidentof the Board of Trade to bear in mind that theOpposition would certainly raise the question whetherthe Pair Wages Clause should be included in contractswhich would benefit from the subsidies now proposed.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that the Dominions Office would like to be consulted in regard to the form of the announcementproposed, in order that it should be made clear that the subsidies related to United Kingdom shipping only.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE agreed tothis course.The Cabinet agreed(l)    To accept the recommendations madeby the Committee on Shipping and shipbuilding, as summarised in the.Appendix to these Conclusions:*(2)   To authorise the President of theBoard of Trade to make a statement in the House of Commons, on general lines, in regard to these proposals.
U BUILDING-QGXEVIESkPreviousBerenc e:jatinet 4If), Con-plus ion 3. )8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (CP. -68(39)), covering a draft ofthe Building Societies Bill which the Committee on building Societies recommended the Cabinet to approve for introduction at a very early date.     The major points inthe Bill had been discussed with representatives of theBuilding Societies, who were in general agreement with its provisions.     As a result of the Judgment in the Borderscase, which had been delivered after the Meeting mentionedin the margin, considerable changes had had to be made inthe draft Bill.     The main changes were as follows:-(i)    Clause 4.     Provisions designed to preventthe borrower from assuming unjustifiablythat the making of an advance to him bythe Society is evidence that the estateis sufficient security for that advance.(ii)   Clause 5.

restriction   9Iribbon*velopment1935.IndingI1&apos;III leviousIference:ibiiiet 52Is), Con-conclusion 5 andipendix ii.)The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (C.P.-69(39)), relating toamendments of the Restriction of Ribbon Development Act,1935.      This Act had necessarily been of a somewhatexperimental character, and its objects (viz., theprevention of damage to the traffic value and amenity valueof our roads) were not being as fully achieved as had been hoped.     The inability or unwillingness of many authoritiesto make full use of their powers had been due largely tothe financial provisions of the Act, which contained no provision for grants towards the compensation that an authority might have to pay as a result of effectiveexercise of their powers under Section 2 to controlbuilding within 220 feet from the middle of the road and access to the road.      Difficulties had also arisen inconnection with restrictions on the standard widths of roads.      In the circumstances explained in his Memorandum,the Minister sought the authority of the Cabinet:-(a)   To inform highway authorities, as occasionmay arise; that the Government intend, whenpossible, to amend the Restriction ofRibbon Development Act,  1935 -(i)    so as to enable Road PundGrants to be given in connectionwith compensation payable forinjurious affection arising fromaccess control under Section 2:(ii)    so as to substitute an &quot;approved plan&quot;for the &quot;approved standard width&quot;as the means by which Section control will be brought into force:To instruct Parliamentary Counsel to draft a Bill, with a view to its submission tothe Home Affairs Committee and subsequentintroduction into Parliament, to give effectto these proposals and to include minor amendments by way or removing doubts as tointerpretation, or simplifying the machinery.The Cabinet authorised the Minister to proceed asproposed in (a) and (b).Richmond Terrace, s.W.122nd March, 19390
inAPPENDIX./O.P.67(39j7Shipping and Shipbuilding.Conclusions.(i)    That a tramp shipping subsidy of  2% millions perannum should be made available for a period of fiveyears subject to an arrangement for determining, by reference to the index number of shipping freights,whether in any given year subsidy should be paidin full, or paid at a reduced rate, or not paid.Conditions would be attached to the subsidy,similar to those attaching to the previoussubsidy, regarding employment of British crews,compliance with National Maritime BoardAgreements where applicable and maintenance of freight co-operation.     Shipowners would also berequired to do their utmost to promote theformation of an international laying-up schemewhich would help to safeguard the level of freight rates.The industry would also be required toorganise itself so as to satisfy the Governmentthat at ihe end of the subsidy period it will be ina better position than it now is to maintainitself without Government assistance.(ii)    That  10 millions should be made available forlending to shipowners over a period of two years atfavourable rates of interest for the purpose ofbuilding tramps and plain cargo liners.The loans would be made on financial termssimilar to those in the Scrap and Build scheme under the British Shipping (Assistance) Act,1935, i.e. repayment over twelve years and interest at favourable rates.(iii)    That for the purpose of forming a reserve of tonnage by the purchase of useful cargo vessels which would otherwise be sold to foreign owners or sold forbreaking up, a sum not exceeding  2 millions,
11 K1 i 0together with the sum required for the maintenance ofthe vessels, should he provided.(iv)    That as regards the defence of liner shipping fromState-aided foreign competition, financial provision should he made to enable assistance to be rendered to individual liner companies requiring such assistance,and that an Advisory Committee should be appointed toexamine and report on applications for such assistance.The industry ashed for  5 millions for fiveyears, though without expecting anything like this sum to be spent.     It is not considered necessary to indicate a sum.     If one is called for by legislative practice then  10 millions for two years might be stated.As a condition of setting up the Committeethe liner section of the industry should berequired to work out a plan for the maintenanceof a defence fund, if such a fund is necessary,out of the resources of the industry afterGovernment assistance comes to an end.(v)    That expenditure should be authorised of a sum notexceeding  -g- million per annum for five years ( ^million for tramps and  3; million for cargo liners)to provide a special inducement for the placing oforders for ftow ships in the next twelve months.I propose to meet the shipbuilding industry,and the industries supplying shipbuildingrequirements, with a view to getting suchguarantees in respect of prices as may be practicable,,
