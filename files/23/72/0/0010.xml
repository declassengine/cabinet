THE CABINET. 1.   Trie Prime Minister welcomed two membersof the Cabinet who were present for the first time,namely, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries
-2-THE CONVERSION 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informedISSUE.his colleagues that the subscription list for 150,000,000 of 2$ Treasury Bonds at par had closedhalf an hour after the opening on the basis of cash offers.   The applications for conversion hadnot yet been received, so it did not appear likely that any great part of the cash offer would berequired.
19^7ptj kinG&apos;S S,   The Prime Minister made a statement on the speech subject of the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of theM) ON PRORO-G AT ION new Parliament.   He felt that the Government ought(2) ON THE to announce some social legislation to figure inOPENINGOP THE NEW the King&apos;s Speech. He hoped that the Chancellor ofPARLIAMENT.the Exchequer, the Minister of Health and thejT*0^        Minister of Labour would consider the mattertogether, in order to ensure that matters were not allowed to drift.    So far as he could gather fromtravelling about the country, the general state ofunemployment was disturbing public opinion.   trouble was also arising out of the administration of the&quot;Means Test&quot;.   He gathered that an opposition wasbeing sedulously organised, and that before christmas it was not unlikely that Public AssistanceCommittees one after another would ask the LocalAuthorities to relieve them of the embarrassmentof administering the Means Test.   There was also apossibility of disorder.   Another subject on which&apos; organised propaganda was widespread was disarmament.India was another subject that would require mentionin the King&apos;s Speech.The Cabinet agreed  (a) ^hat a Cabinet Committee, composed, of -The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of state for War -should be formed to draft, forconsideration by the Cabinet, theEing&apos;s Speeches on the Opening ofthe new Parliament and on the&quot;Prorogation of the present Parliament:(b) That the Secretary to the cabinet should ask the Ministers at the headof Departments to submit contributions for(l) The King&apos;s Speech on Prorogation,(2) The Ring&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament.
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the world was full of troubles at thepresent time, but the questions on which he wantedimmediate decisions were on the Agenda Paper of theCabinet.
(THE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE.The Withdrawalof Germany,Proposed Con-fere nee , inLondon,(previous reference:Cabinet 49(32), Con-conclusions (b)and (c) ,)5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum.by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(C.P.-338 (32)) summarising the course of eventssubsequent to the decision of the Cabinet at theMeeting referred to in the margin, that an endeavour should be made to secure the return ofGermany to the Disarmament Conferenoe by callingin aid the Declaration of Mutual Consultation ofJuly 13, 1932, to which the French, German, italian and United Kingdom Governments were parties ,The Memorandum also set forth the reactions ofItaly, Germany, France and the United States tothe suggested meeting in London at an early datethat.for an exchange of views, and submitted, the line that should be taken when the meeting takes placeshould be as follows:-&quot;That on the question of principle weshould try to get France and Italy toagree with us upon a public statement that the contemplated disarmament convention would cancel out completelythe relevant disarmament clauses ofPart V of the Treaty of Versaillesso that the latter would not reviveon the expiry of the disarmament convention.    Having made this joint declaration, we should indicate thatthe German government&apos;s material claim for various readjustments in Germany^present armaments to be embodied in* the proposed Disarmament Conventionmust be regarded as matters for negotiation at Geneva when germany has resumed her place there, as our declaration on the question ofprinciple would enable her to do.&quot;In the course of a statement explaining in further detail the situation as set forth in his memorandum,.the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs mentioned certain new information (derivedin part from a member of the British Embassy inBerlin), e.g., that France is likely to produce anew Disarmament plan;    that there is little doubt
that Germany is aiming at some measure of re-armament;that the idea was growing in Germany that it wouldbe to their advantage to postpone a decision and thattime was in their favour;   that among the countrygentry the possibility of war was being discussedfor the first time;   that the German government appeared to be ill-informed about public opinion inthis country, and that any criticism we might makearmamentsof their intentions&apos;relating to, was received by themwith extreme surprise;    that there was a certainamount of danger in agreeing to the German proposalfor a Militia.   The Secretary of State adhered, however,to the proposal,as set forth above, in his memorandum as the best course in all the circumstances.   If thedisarmament propagandists in this country were toldof the German intentions, their reply would be&quot;Can you be surprised at Germany&apos;s attitude, when she has been refused all reasonable treatment?&quot;The Prime Minister thought it was important thatthe British Delegation at Geneva should have adefinite policy.    Everyone at Geneva was looking to us to give a lead, even if it only gave them the chance of making fervid speeches.   The United kingdom were the &quot;candid examiner&quot; of the various proposals,and consequently could not adopt a very ^ehogiewtline^.   There was a tendency, therefore, for people to say that we obstructed everything.   The question arose as to whether we ought to allow the DisarmamentConference to fail and to have the blame heaped upon us, or whether we ought not to announce that we were willing to go to any length in the direction of disarmament to which other countries situated simi-larly to ourselves were ready to go.
The First Lord of the Admiralty, reported thathe had had an extremely valuable conversation that morning with Mr Norman Davis, the American Delegate.He gathered that the Hoover proposals were not acceptable to the Americans, and he was hopeful of preparing a useful collaboration.After the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had read the extract from his Memorandum set forthon the first page of this Minute, the Prime minister asked what was to be the next stage after the conversations with M. Herriot?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat Germany was prepared to come to London for aConference.    Italy actually preferred London to anyother place for the meeting,    France, howeverobjected to London and preferred Geneva.    He thoughtthat it might be possible to get the Germans to cometo Geneva, not to take part in the Disarmament Confer-ence, hut to discuss the terms on which they might come back to Geneva.    One difficulty was that thePresident of the Conference had plans of his own.The French viev was that it was possible to proceedwith Disarmament discussions notwithstanding theabsence of Germany.   He himself felt, however, thatthe French would not make substantial concessions insuch conditions.The Prime Minister reported that Mr Norman Davishad. informed him that he had&apos; learned from Mr Wilson,the American Minister at Berne, who is at Geneva,that there is a strong propaganda there to the effectthat the London Conference had been proposed in orderto &quot;blanket&quot; Geneva,   Mr Wilson had urged Mr Davisto support Geneva as the place for the Conference,
not on the ground that it was really as good asLondon, but that it was the more politic plan.Another reason in favour of Geneva was that president Hoover and Mr Roosevelt were both preparedthat America should be represented as effectivelyas was possible^in the circumstances at the Confer-ence.    If, however, the Conference was held inLondon it might become a point in the Presidentialcampaign.   On the other hand, if the Conference washeld at Geneva it would be regarded as part of thework that the American Delegation were doing there.Consequently he thought that the Conference shouldtake place at Geneva, in about a fortnight&apos;s time.There was general agreement that the PrimeMinister should be prepared to attend a Pour-power conference at Geneva, together with the foreign secretary.   The general line proposed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and setforth at the head of this Minute, also met withgeneral approval.The question was then raised as to what line should be taken if the French proved obstinate andwere unwilling to make the proposed public statemeitthat the contemplated Disarmament Convention wouldcancel out completely the relevant DisarmamentClauses of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles sotftaat the latter would not revive on the expiry ofthe Disarmament Convention.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs .thought that in these circumstances the UnitedKingdom Delegation should make their own declaration.He was inclined to think that in the last resortthe French could not stand out,
The question was then discussed as to what attitude we should adopt ifthe Poles and Czechs, who were much concerned inthe German claim for equality of treatment, shouldtake up an obstructive line.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that this point should be left to thePrime Minister and his colleagues at the Conference,The Cabinet were reminded that not only theFrench but also Dr. Benes and M. Politis (the two latter in concert) were reported to be working outnew schemes for the Disarmament Conference.   It was thought possible that these schemes might envisage aseries of Locarno Pacts from which the United kingdom would be omitted.    It was generally felt that such a development would be satisfactory.In the course of the discussion the question raised earlier by the Prime Minister   as to whether we ought to express a willingness to go as farin disarmament as any other nation similarly situatedwas prepared to go   was considered on general lines.    The question was raised, for example, as towhether we were prepared to abandon the weaponsprohibited to Germany by Part V of the Treaty ofVersailles.    In this connection it was suggestedthat there was not the least likelihood that any such proposal could possibly be accepted universally.The Secretary of State for War expressed thehope that no such decision would be taken today.He recalled that the Technical Advisers had madequite clear that such proposals were impossible.He thought that this was especially true of the Navy.-9-
Without Tanks the Army would certainly have to beincreased in size.   He recalled also that theSecretary of State for Air had much to say on theabandonment of naval and military aviation.   Thearguments of the Departments concerned would have tobe considered roost carefully before any decision wastaken on this subject.The Prime Minister agreed that if the discussions at Geneva took such a turn it would be necessary to consult the Cabinet,mhe Prime Minister, after instructing theSecretary to make rather a full record of this discussion, invited his colleagues to check itcarefully.The conclusions of the Cabinet may be summed upas follows:-(a) That at the forthcoming conference with M, Herriot the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to agreethat the Four-Power Conference shouldbe held, at Geneva, or in the vicinitythereof: .    -(b) That the Prime Minister should be(asked to attend the Conference/^&quot;!?&quot; it takes place: A(c) That the following proposal of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs4 as to the line that should be taken if the Conference takes place should be approved as the basis of the UnitedKingdom Delegation&apos;s policy:-&quot;That on the question of principlewe should try to get France andItaly to agree with us upon apublic statement that the \contemplated disarmament convention would cancel outcompletely the relevantdisarmament clauses of Part Vof the Treaty of Versailles sothat the latter would not reviveon the expiry of the disarmament convention.    Having made thisjoint declaration, we should indicate that the GermanGovernment&apos;s material claim for various readjustments inGermany&apos;s present armaments
to be embodied in the proposedDisarmament Convention must beregarded as matters for negotia-tion at Geneva when Germany hasresumed her place there, as our declaration on the question ofprinciple would enable her to do.&quot;(d) That the United Kingdom delegates should not be authorised to undertakeany kind of commitment for renunciation-tion of weapons Ibrbidden to Germanyunder the terms of Part V of theTreaty of Versailles without further consultation with the Cabinet:(e) That it was desirable to confine theConference, if possible, to the UnitedKingdom   Prance, Germany, Italy andthe United States of America, but thatsome discretion must be left to thePrime Minister and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs as to thepossible admission of other nations,such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, ifpressed strongly:(f) That discretion should also be left to them at the coming Conferences, as to other points Of detail.
EGYPT. C The Cabinet had before them a secret memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign previous(Reference: Affairs (CP.-329 (32)), giving a full account[Cabinet 321(31), 0o&quot;C o;f an extremely cordial interview in Geneva betweenc&quot;conclusion 2.)Sidky Pasha (the Prime Minister of Egypt) and himself on the subject of reopening negotiations on the Treaty question and the Sudan.   Attached tothe Memorandum was a Paper in French, handed tothe Secretary of State by Sidky Pasha, setting forth the views of the latter.   The Secretary ofState had promised the Egyptian Prime minister that he would inform the Cabinet of all KisExcellency had said and would invite their opinionon the proposal put forward by Sidky Pasha that private and unofficial conversations between himself and Sir Percy Loraine might be begun assoon as the latter returned to Egypt, with a view-to preparing the ground for a resumption of officialnegotiations when the time came for them.   TheSecretary of State mentioned that he had made clear to Sidky Pasha that modifications, ascompared with the earlier proposals, would betrequired in connection with the disposition ofthe British forces once they were removed fromthe cities, and that we should not be able toagree to any alteration in the existing system and personnel of the Sudan,Administration.In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs gave a number of reasons why the Egyptian situation could not beleft indefinitely.   For example, under the Declara-tion of 1922 the &quot;Four Points&quot; were reserved&quot;until such time as it may be possible, by free-12-
discussions and friendly accommodation on bothsides, to conclude Agreements in regard theretobetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governmentof Egypt&quot;.   To leave matters as they were indefinitelywas to encourage the extremist elements in Egypt.Sidky Pasha occupied a position midway between the palace Party and the Extreme Left.   With neither ofthe extreme Parties were negotiations possible, butSidky Pasha was a negotiable person.    It should bepossible to secure a better bargain with him than if matters were left to take their chance later.At the present time we had two bargaining counters,First, the desire of Egypt to enter the League ofNations.    Iraq and Turkey had already done so, - theformer under our aegis.    In course of time Egyptwas bound to be admitted to the League, and thispoint would cease to exist as a bargaining counter.Second, the capitulary position.    Everyone, from lord Gromer onward, was agreed that the capitulationsmust come to an end in Egypt, as they had everywhereelse.   He recognised, however, that the War Officeand the Air Ministry would have a good deal to sayabout the details of any settlement.After a discussion in the course of which theSecretary of State for War explained the views ofthe General Staff in opposition to the departure ofBritish troops from. Cairo, or, rather, from&apos; itsvicinity, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should setup a Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence to examine theproposals of the Foreign Office fora Treaty with Egypt:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should instruct theBritish High Commissioner in Egypt
that, pending the above examination,he should not enter into conversa-tions with Sidky Pasha with a viev;to exploring the possibilities of aTreaty, and should consider himself as without instructions.
AFGHANISTAN .(previous^Reference:Cabinet 29(31), Con-clusion 11,)7. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for India(CP.-300 (32)) on the subject of the reply to begiven to an enquiry received from the AfghanGovernment as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment if the Russian Soviet attacked afghanistan-8 tan-.   After setting forth details of the attitudeof the Afghan Government towards both the BritishGovernment and the Soviet Government, and of previous enquiries by the Afghan Governmenttogether with the replies thereto, the secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and India invitedtheir colleagues&apos;  concurrence to proposals whichthey briefly       summarised as follows(i) The Afghan Government should beinformed   that in the opinion ofHis Majesty*s Government there isno immediate danger of a Sovietattack.(ii) They should be strongly advisedagainst the conclusion of anobjectionable commercial treaty with the Soviet.(iii)  Sir R. Maconachie should be author-is ed to repeat the general assurance,already given, of British interestin Afghan independence, and to add4 a very cautious reference to thepossibility that it might be ofsome benefit to Afghanistan to join the League of Nations.(iv) He should be further authorised togive, if necessary, a guardedspecific assurance that in certaincircumstances His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould break off official relationswith the Soviet.(v)  If such assurance is given,  itshould be emphasised that thequestion whether any further action could be taken, if the case arose,would depend entirely on circumstancesat the time.(vi) The whole of Sir R. Maconachie&apos;communication would be governed by ageneral caveat that it holds goodonly while relevant conditions remainmaterially unaltered.-15-
The draft of a Despatch embodying the above proposals was annexed to the Memorandum,The Secretary of State ^or India, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, and the President/&apos; &apos;     ! &apos; &apos; ; - &quot;:  - &amp;: 11 - &apos;it;  /    -     &apos; &apos;&apos; v./..fill :&apos; i: ::Bi5ftlBsssspes !li*5K3f ?lof the Board of Education (as a former viceroy of India), made statements in support of theproposals summarised above, which were discussed by the Cabinet in some detail.In the discussion it was suggested that in thedraft Despatch to Sir R. Maconachie (CP.-300 (32)Appendix 4) a re-draft was required of the followings ent once:-&quot;If Russia invaded Afghan territoryfor the purpose of permanent ocoupa-tion or to provoke a Russo-Afghanwar&quot;, etc.,and it was thought that it would be preferable touse some such phrase as &quot;In the event of a serioxisinvasion of Afghan territory by Russia&quot;.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of&apos;Statefor India, set forth in CP.-30O (32)),subject to the possible re-draft, bythe Secretary of State for India inconsultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs,  of thepassage quoted above.
9rtIMPORT,DUTIES.[[proposed[preferencejto Palestine[(previous reference: -Cabinet 25(33), Con-clusion 1.)a.5ft 607&apos;8.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-333 (32))on the subject of Imperial Preference for Palestine.In his Memorandum the Secretary of State suggestedthat, in view of the opposition of most of thecountries concerned to the grant of Imperial Prefer-ence to Palestine, it would be useful to have re-constituted the Cabinet Committee which had previouslyexamined the matter, in order that the present position might be fully and carefully considered.The Cabinet approved the proposalto refer the question to the CabinetCommittee, to which the Attorney- .General should be added.    consequently the Committee would be composed asfollows:-The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Attorney-General,
. The Cabinet had before them the followingtents on the subject of Coast Defence and thepore Base:-^he Report of the Coast defence sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence, together wriththe Conclusions and Recommendationsof the Committee of Imperial Defencethereon at the 256th Meeting, heldon June 9,  1952 (CP.-238 (32))which are given in the Appendix.These Conclusions not only cover the organisation o^ Coast Defence,but include a recommendation thatthe first stage of the plan ofdefence for the Naval Base at singapore, subject to necessarymodifications, should be proceeded with:A Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (C.P.-252 (32))  pointing outthe unsatisfactory state of affairs at singapore from the defence point of view;drawing attention to the fact that thereis evidence already that some of the communities of the Empire who contributedlargely to the cost of the Base are verydissatisfied with the present situation;and suggesting that the Cabinet shouldcouple with the decision in regard tothe defences, approval to proceed withthe Base as finance allows;    the detailsof expenditure to be left for considera-tion between the Treasury and theAdmiralty:A Note by the Secretary of State forAir (C.P.-325 (32)) on the need forfurther aerodrome accommodation at singapore.    A site had been acquired by the local Government, and a recentestimate for its preparation involved a total expenditure of about  50,000.He therefore asked that cabinet authority should be given for theconstruction of a second aerodrome:A Note by the Secretary of State forWar (C.P.-327 (32)) covering a Memo-randum by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, which stated that assoon as the approval of the cabinet is given to the Report of the coast defence Sub-Committee the problem will arise of the best means by whichthe recommendations contained in theReport can be implemented, and summarised the immediate requirements as follows:-(i) A Cabinet decision authorising the resumption of work on the singapore defences is needed.-18-
(ii) Special provision tinder theArmy Vote is required over and above the provision that is normally made for Army expendi-ture .(iii) This special provision shouldamount to about  120,000 for1933, and to about  325,000 ayear for the following 4 years .The question was raised as-to whether theproposals of the Committee of Imperial Defence didnot infringe the extension of the Armaments Truce.In this connection the Cabinet were reminded thatno expenditure could take place until the next financial year, by which time the present extensionof the Armaments Truce would have expired.   TheCabinet, however, felt that the utmost care must betaken to ensure that the Government was not exposed to the possibility of any criticism that they wereinfringing the Truce.The Cabinet then examined in detail each ofthe recommendations of the Committee of ImperialDefence, as set forth in the Conclusions in theAppendix, together with the proposals of theMinisters at the head of the Defence service as set forth in their respective Memorandasummarised above.In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Air pointed out that the War office proposals in C.P.-337, if approved, would raise
the question of the provision of ancillary air-units to co-operate with the gun defences, inaccordance with recommendation (d) of the Reportof the Coast Defence Sub-committee.   There had notbeen time, since the circulation of the War OfficePaper, to discuss in detail what aircraft would benecessary, but he estimated that one flight of aircraft for spotting, and one flight of fighters,would be required.   He would ask that the cabinet should approve in principle the provision of thenecessary ancillary.aircraft, leaving the details,including the stages at which they should beprovided, to be worked out by the War Office andthe Air Ministry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought thatthe arguments for proceeding with the first stage of the armament of Singapore were very powerful.It was necessary, however, to confine what was done to absolute essentials.    He included in this theSecretary of State for War&apos;s proposals for defence in CP.-327 (32) and the First Lord of the AdmiraltyTsproposals in CP.-252 (32).   He was, however, notyet convinced that the new aerodrome was essential,as there was already one aerodrome at Singapore.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatthe Coast Defence Sub-Committee had approved theprinciple of co-operation between the^ Services efeslcoast defence.   The cost of an aerodrome was about 50,000.    If there was an emergency, great difficul-ties would arise if only one aerodrome were available.Hostponementwas, of course, possible, but he/   felt bound to warn the Cabinet that in emergencythe requirement was for two aerodromes .
C e) t)The Prime Minister asked the Secretary of Statefor Air to watch the situation and to raise thequestion if the necessity should arise.The First Lord of the Admiralty warned theCabinet that his proposal in C.P.-252 (.32) onlycovered the question of the Base and did not includelocal seaward defences,The Prime Minister said that that class of question would have to be&apos; discussed between theService Departments concerned and the Treasury.In his view it was advisable,  in eases of this kind,that before the Cabinet considered the questionthey should have in writing the views of the treasury the Cabinet approved in principle -(a) The Conclusions ef the Committee ofImperial Defence as set forth in theAppendix, including those relatingto the Singapore Naval Base,and(b) The proposals of the Ministers atthe head of the Defence Services,as set forth in their respectiveMemoranda, for giving effect to theabove Conclusions.The above decision, however,was subject to the followingunders tanding:-(i) That no actual increase inarmaments was to be made until after the expiration of the Truce adopted by theDisarmament Conference:(ii) That the proposals of the^Defence Departments were subject to approval indetail by the Treasury:(iii) That the Secretary of State, for Airfs proposal for a newaerodrome should be reservedfor further consideration.

I concur inthe opinion of Sir Philip Chetwodeand the Government of India thata medal should not be granted.The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that the Commander-in-Chief in Indiaoriginally had been opposed to the grant of any. medal.

APPENDIX. 261RECOMMENDATIONS OP THE COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL defence on COAST DEFENCE POLICY.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed -(I) To approve the following recommendations bythe Coast Defence Sub-Committee:-&quot;(a) Coast defences should be organised on abasis of co-operation between the three defence Services, the gun retaining its place as the main deterrent againstNaval attack.(b) At the same time, aircraft are a mostimportant factor to be reckoned with in considering both forms of attack andforms of defence.     Their co-operation will always increase the security of the fortress and add to the deterrent effectof the fixed defences.     In the case ofthe more important naval bases their co-operation is essential. 11(II) To recommend the adoption of the following recommendations:-&quot;(c) We consider that the first stage of theplan of defence for the naval base at singapore, modified in the light of thelatest developments in coast artillery,should be proceeded with, including theprovision of three 15-inch guns.
