The Cabinet had tinder consideration the sanedocuments as at the morning Meeting referred to inthe margin, and, in addition, a Memorandum by theChief of the Imperial General Staff (CP.-573 (32)),which had been handed round by the Secretary of Statefor War at the end of the morning Meeting, on theproposals for qualitative military disarmament con-tained in C .P ,-360 (32),After continuing for a time the general discussionof the draft Declaration on Germany&apos;s claim, to equality of rights, attached to CP.-360 (32), the Cabinetpassed to a discussion of the Explanatory Note annexed to that Memorandum, in which proposals are made for.giving effect, In naval, military and air armamentsrespectively, to the principle that all States shouldcontent themselves with the same kinds of arms, butthat changes in Germany&apos;s fighting strength must becarried out in such a way as not to conflict withhothe pr inc simple e o f^ r e-armament.The trend of the Cabinet&apos;s deliberations at the morning and afternoon Meetings may be summed up asfollows:-THE POLICY.(a) At the moment these Conclusions must,,be regarded as provisional and mutuallyinterdependent, each item thereof be ingtreated not as a separate and independ-ent decision, but as part of a completepolicy in process of construction:(b) Disarmament is a part of..and cannot be dissociated from,theGovernment&apos;s main policy of securing peace.&quot;This should be firmly stated at thehead of any Declaration of policy .
9 H f*0 i 0[THE DRAFT DECLARATION ON GERMANY&quot; claim TO EQUALITY OF RIGHTS.i(c) Subject to (b) and to re-drafting,as provided for by the Conclusionset forth at the end of these minutes, the draft form of Declara-tion attached to the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  (C.P.-360 (32)) provides abasis for a statement of theGovernment&apos;s policy.(d) The first part of the draft form of delclaration might be improved by a reference to the machinery providedby Article XIX of the Covenant ofthe League of Nations for rectifyingany provisions of the Peace Treatiesor other Treaties that are found toprovide intolerable grievances orburdens.(e) The proposal in the draft declaration to agree to the German claim forequality is acceptable, on condition that the utmost care is taken toobtain satisfactory guarantees thatGermany will not upset the tranquilityof Europe.GUARANTEES BY GERMANY.(f) Germany should be called upon toaffirm her determination to enterinto the comity of Europe, to co-operate in maintaining peace, to observe her various undertakings,and to refer all questions of controversy to the League of Nations.(g) Germany&apos;s guarantees not to be limited in time to the duration of theDisarmament Convention.(h) Subject to these guarantees byGermany, the proposals in the second part of the draft Declaration as tothe manner in which the German Claimto equality should be met were approved:that is to say (in brief) (i) GermanyVslimitations to be contained In the.sameDisarmament Convention as those of other powers, and (ii) to last for the sameperiod and to be subject to the samemethods  of revision as those of othercountries:    and (iii) all States shouldcontent themselves with the same kinds of arms, but any changes in Germany&apos;sQi fighting strength must be carried outin such a way as not to conflict withthe principle of no re-armament,(The precise wording of (iii), it was felt, required very careful scrutiny.)(i) The principle in (h)  (iii) was deemedessential in order to bring Germanyback to the Disarmament Conference,
and there was general agreement that,without it, Germany&apos;s return (whichis essential to the success of theConference) could not be obtained.The proposals summarised in (h) (i)and (ii) were considered useful asan additional inducement to Germany.(j) If the German Government should refuseto give the guarantees suggested in(f) and to come back to the DisarmamentConference in return for the adoptionof the three principles set forth in(h), they would antagonise both world opinion and moderate opinion in Germany,particularly if they then proceeded with their plans for re-organisationand re-armament .BRITISH LEADERSHIP.(k) If the United Kingdom is to recoverleadership in Disarmament it will beby a political lead on some such lines as the above rather than by some freshprogramme on the details of disarma-ment.    The French proposals (so faras they are published) and the Hooverproposal, both appear to contain usefulmaterial on this latter aspect of thesub ject.THE TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS OH&quot; DISARMAMENT.(Annex to CP.-360 (52) .)(l) The political agreements contemplatedabove, however, will require to becompleted by technical disarmamentagreements .    Our attitude on the points,    raised in the Annex to CP.-360 (32)requires to be defined at once,irrespective of whether it is to beincluded with the proposed declaration on Germany&quot; s Claim, to Equality of rights in order that the Government, and our representatives at Geneva, may be in aposition to make an authoritativestatement of our position on any pointas netel aris es .(m) In any version of the Annex to CP.-360(.32) as finally approved, which may bepublished, the alternatives to the main proposals  (e.g., the alternative to theabolition of submarines) should, as faras may be found practicable   be suppressed.    It is preferable thatthe alternatives should not be mentioned unless and until the mainproposal for each weapon has been rejected.   They should then be offered in the course of discussion at theConference.NAVAL ARMAMENT S .(n) T&amp;Sxproposals in the Annex, to CP.-360(32) wrere approved, subject to the
omission, if found practicable, ofthe alternative to the proposedabolition of submarines, and tocertain details which were left for discussion between the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (e .g ., the reference to Budgetary expenditure).Consideration should be given to thePrime Minister1s tentative suggestion(i) that the London Naval Treatyshotild be completed by an Agree-ment between France and Italy(for which the^ prospects seemedmore hopeful) enabling them to adhere to Part III of the Treaty rand(ii) that, subject to (i), an invita*-tion should be addressed by theTreaty Powers to Germany to join the Naval Disarmament conference which is due to take place in 19 35,Germany would be asked in the mean-while to suspend, naval construction,or at least all types of vessel outsidethe Treaty categories until 19 35,and to draw up her programmes witha view to their being fitted intothe Naval Treaty in 1935,It was suggested that this sus-pension could be justified to Germanyowing to the fact that the Confer-ence will take place in less than three years time, before much progress could in any event be madewith any naval construction pro-gramme .LAND ARMAMENTS.From a military point of view verypowerfi.il arguments have been adducedin favour of -(i) the retention of tanks as life-saving-weapons;    as the weapons of smallvolunteer armies like our own;    ascompensating in some degree for lack of numbers as compared, withthe large conscript armies of theContinent;    as especially useful in maintaining order and in policingcolonial territories and frontiers;and as avoiding the necessity for large increases in other arms ,The 16-ton tank is strongly advocatedas the most useful type..   Unlike theheavy tank of 30 tons or more (whichthe military authorities are willingto abolish) this type is not an offensive weapon in the sense thatit can be us ed for attacking permanentfortifications and is required largelyfor dealing with machine-gun posts.(ii) the retention of the 6-inch and 4.5inch howitzers, provided as part
A Memorandum by tine Secretary of Statefor War (C.P.-362 (32)) covering aMilitary Appreciation of the present world Situation by the Chief of theImperial General Staff.A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air (C.P.-369 (32)) commenting once.-360 (32) from the point of view ofair forces.    The principal points inthis Memorandum were as follows:-Internationalisation of civil aviationis impracticable.The proposal to refuse to Germany&quot;examples&quot; of air armaments (whileconceding her examples of the otherforbidden weapons) is inconsistentand will encourage refusal of theproposals ,The concession of specimens of military aircraft to Germany would introduceno new menace, as they already possesslarge numbers of civil aircraft suitablefor warlike purposes, and facilitiesfor manufacturing military aircraft,The proposed reduction to 650 kilosweight ttroop-carriers and seaplanesexcepted) means the scrapping of all military and naval aircraft inexistence and is li&quot; .ely to lead tothe rejection of the proposal.   the limiting figure should be 3,000 kilos .A re-draft of the proposals, to includethe above points, was attached.    It waspointed out also that the position ofthe Dominions and India, and nationswhose air forces are in an embryonicstate would have to be specially safeguarded,as the 33 1/3 per cent, cut would cause an embarrassment.-4a-
of our regular equipment, insteadof adopting as a maximum the105 mm. upper limit of guns andhowitzers permitted to Germany.This was suggested, both formilitary reasons and to avoid the need of replacing our equip-ment at a cost of  3,500,000.The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, in his Memorandum C.P.-373(32), claimed that &quot;the 6-inchhowitzer/, which is not a weaponcapable of destroying permanentfortifications, or of any greatattaching power, is absolutely essential for our needs in the caseof operations on the Worth-west frontier and in other- possibletheatres in the East&quot;.The Cabinet were impressed by the military considerations urged in regard to theabove weapons, but they also realised thedifficulty of refusing to Germany the weapons we retained ourselves, and the objection to allowing her to acquirethose weapons and thus to increase her military strength.   Various suggestions-were made for meeting the difficulty,e.g.:-by mentioning no upper limit formedium tanks or medium movable gunsat the present stage, and to leavethe figure to be thrashed out atthe Disarmament Conference:by justifying a difference in arroa-ments owing to the peculiar natureof our military commitments as a colonial Power:by some plan allowing for the retentionof existing weapons of these calibresfor a term of years before replacementwithin Treaty limits:and, in the case of the howitzers,by giving up the 6-inch weapon on condition that the 4.5-inch howitzer(which only slightly exceeds 105mm)is retained.The question was left,  in the firstinstance, to the Drafting Committee(see Conclusion), which was invitedto discuss the matter with the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff.
AIR ARMAMENTS.(q) No final decision was taken on thepassage in the Annex to C.P.-360 (32)on Air Armaments.   This was criticised by the Secretary of State for Air inC.P.-369 (32), who proposed analternative version.    The limitationof the unladen weight of military aircraft (other than troop carriersand seaplanes) to 650 kilogrammes(2/3rds ton) was stated by theSecretary of State for Air to be impracticable, as neither the Britishnor French air forces include machinesof so light a weight.   The Air Ministrypropose 3,000 kilos (about 3 tons).It was suggested that for the purposesof a published document the formulashould be &quot;a limitation on the unladen weight of military and naval aircraft&quot;.The matter was left in the firstinstance to the Drafting Committee.QUANTIT ATIVE DISARMAMENT.(r) The observations on QuantitativeDisarmament in the Annex to C.P.-360(.32) need not appear in any publishedDeclaration.TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.(s) Eventually, as part of the DisarmamentTreaty, careful, arrangements will haveto be concerted as to the dates atwhich scrapping of material and itsreplacement by&quot;smaller weapons is totake place, in order to avoid an uneconomic procedure.In addition to the above, a proposal which met with much support was the Chancellor of the Exchequersuggestion for a gradual reduction of armaments by stages to the level allowed to Germany by the Treatyof Versailles, each stage being adjusted to the stateof Europe and conditioned by the attitude of Germanyand other Powers,The Prime Minister, at the end of the discussion,raised the question as to whether a declaration of ,moral equality must necessarily be followed by adeclaration of actual equality in weapons or in strength, or on a scale approaching thereto.   Nationshe pointed out, had varied requirements, whichjustified a certain variation in their defensiveequipment.
SO&amp;The Cabinet agreed  That a Drafting Committee,  composed as follows  The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The President of the Board ofEducation  should meet, with authority to invitethe collaboration of Cabinet colleagues on particular points and to hear theviews of experts (e.g,, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, as suggestedin (p) (bove), in order to prepare, inthe light of the above discussions, adraft statement of the Government&apos;policy on Disarmament for considera-tion by the Cabinet.
2.      The Cabinet agreed: -That the Government speakers at the Lord Mayor&apos;sBanquet on November 9th should be:-The Prime Minister orLord President of the Council,The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The First Lord of the admiralty on behalf of the Defence Services.If the Foreign Secretary should be at Geneva, heshould arrange for some other Cabinet Minister to take his place
