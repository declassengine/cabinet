s &amp; IREDUCTION AND The Cabinet had before them the followingLIMITATION of armaments * documents on the subject of Disarmament:-A Most Secret &quot;Form of declaration on Germany&apos;s Claim to Equality of rights&quot; (CP.-377 (32)) which hadbeen drawn up by the CabinetCommittee appointed at the meeting referred to in the margin, afterconsultation with the Ministers andChiefs of Staff of the defence services:A Most Secret Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (CP .-384(32)) covering a Minute by the Chiefof the Air Staff and protestingstrongly against the first sub-paragraph of the passage on page 3of CP.-377 (32), relating to AirArmament s, viz.:-&quot;The only completely satisfactory method of dealing with the futuremenace of bombing from the air isthe entire abolition of militaryand naval aircraft, combined withan international prohibition of bombing and international regula-tion of civil aviation.   Moreover,it is apparent that the abolitionof all military and naval aircraft would carry with it substantial reductions in both the cost and scale of military and naval arma-ments.   While recognising that theremay he formidable difficulties involved in such a proposal, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom are not convinced that theyare necessarily insuperable, anddesire that they should form thesubject of an immediate andthorough investigation&quot;.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(32), Con-clusion 1.)fit.The discussion in the Cabinet centred almostentirely on the objections of the Secretary of Statefor Air to the paragraph quoted above.    In additionto the objections set forth in the Secretary ofQ State for Air*s Memorandum (CP.-384 (32)), thepassage was criticised, on the ground that neitherthe entire abolition of military and naval aircraft,nor the international regulation of civil aviation,was a practical proposal.   The latter proposal could
42 2rst t^t hionly be carried cut effectively if no nation had. anymachines of its own.   The only effect of the siiggestedStatement, therefore, would be to encourage mostthinking people to believe that the proposals werenot genuine,to enable experts to realise that they wereimpracticable, to create the impression in the AirForce that they were going to be abolished, and togive the extremists on Disarmament the same impression in a word, a pledge would be given, but we should getthenothing at all.    It was suggested that/specific proposals in the second sub-paragraph of the passagerelating to Air Armaments should become thefirst part of that section, and that the first partshould either be suppressed or modified in a more practical sense.On behalf of the Drafting Committee the cabinet were reminded that the ideas set forth in the passageunder consideration had not emanated from the minds of the Drafting Committee, but had already met with aconsiderable degree of support in the Cabinet.   Thefirst proposal for the abolition of military and navalaviation had emanated from the Lord President of theCouncil as long ago as May 4, 1933 (Cabinet 36 (33)),and had at once Interested the Cabinet.   After discus-sion on several occasions the proposal had, at therequest of the Cabinet, been set forth in the form ofa draft Despatch to Geneva elaborating in detail thesuggestion for the abolition of military and naval aircraft combined with a strict international controlof civil aviation (C,P.-164 (33), Enclosure I).Comment on this draft Despatch had been furnished fromthe Admiralty and the War Office.   The First Sea Lordof the Admiralty had expressed the following view:-
% 4. ti&quot;Prom the point of view of the Admiraltyit is considered that as we depend forour existence upon commodities carried in surface ships, and,broadly speaking,aircraft contribute more towards attack upon stirface ships than toward their defence, the total abolition of navaland military aircraft wotild be advantage-ous to this country, on the understandingthat international control of civilaviation would be an essential complementto this&quot;. (C.P.-182 (32).)The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had statedgenerally as follows:-&quot;Prom the broadest view of national defencean effective total abolition of all navaland military aircraft throughotit the* world cannot but be advantageous to thiscountry as tending to restore to us thesea as our first line of defence and asremoving the danger of air attack on london&quot;.  (CP.-176 (32.)The proposal had been strongly criticised by theSecretary of State for Air (CP.-181 (32)), but on a review of all these Memoranda, and after more thanone discussion on the subject and after a telegram had been sent to the Dominions, the Cabinet, without committing themselves on the question of principle,had, on June 7th, so far favoured the plan as toauthorise the Prime Minister and his colleagues atGeneva to sound M. Herriot and S. Grandi on thesubject (Cabinet 31 (32), Conclusion 1 (a)).   Theproposal had. not commended itself to the french ministers and had since lain dormant.The Drafting Committee, in hearing the Experts,had applied itself to the question of whether weshould be substantially more or less safe    if thecomplete proposal could be carried out.   They had no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that we should$ be safer.    It was true that if naval and military airforces were abolished there would be a risk from civilaviation.    Even so, however, it should be possible,
present danger of the &quot;knock-out blow&quot; at the outset of a war.   The Committee were also influenced bythe consideration that if naval and military aviationwere abolished Germany could be given complete equality of status without being allowed to re-arm-herself inthe air.   Another point that had influenced theCommittee was certain peculiarly terrible potentiali-ties which recent secret experiments had shown thataircraft already possessed.   The Committee had feltthat the only way to check such developments was totake the edge off the national organisations whosebusiness it was to explore them intensively.   TheCommittee had also been impressed by the desirabilityof getting public opinion to realise the dangers toall the world from the developments of militaryaviation.    Even if this did not produce results todayit might in the future promote more sweeping measuresof disarmament.A proposal was made, in order to meet the diffi-culties of the Secretary of State for Air in come degree, that the limitation of naval and military aircraft should be confined to those required for police purposes.   A draft to this effect.was read tothe Cabinet.When the question of principle was put to theCabinet by the Prime Minister there was an overwhelroia gmajority in favour of the inclusion of some paragraphopening the way to a possibility of developments onthe lines of the Committee&apos;s proposal now underconsideration.    There was an equally strong desire tohelp the Secretary of State for Air in his difficulties,and a number of proposals were made with this object.The Secretary of State, for Air., while recognising the desire of his colleagues to assist him, felt boundto express his disagreement with much that had been-4-
said.   He reminded the Cabinet that, as set forth inparagraph 4 of his Memorandum C.P.-384 (32), theclaim that the abolition of naval and military aircraft would carry with it substantial reductions in the cost and scale of military and naval armamentswas a very dubious one.   The abolition of aircraft-carriers and aircraft in cruisers, for instance, wouldbe offset by the necessity of building more cruisers,etc.,  as &quot;eyes&quot; for the Fleet.   Corresponding conslder-ations applied to the Army, which would require large additional forces in order to carry out its increasedImperial responsibilities.    As to the danger of aircraft, of course everyone hoped to avoid anotherwar.    If that should happen, however, the developmentsthat now appalled us would be carried out within afew months of the outbreak of war.   We shouldundoubtedly keep our engagements in the letter andin the spirit, but could we rely on others to do thesame?   The primary difficulty was that conditions were unfavourable for the development of civilaviation in this country.   We should be swamped by civil machines produced in far greater numbers on theContinent.    In time our Empire development would be great, but in an emergency our machines would not beable to return in time.   To abolish the Air Forde andto trust to the older Services for our defence wasutterly retrograde.   Whatever might be said now, thefuture of war lay in the air.    Eventually, perhap seven in ten years&apos; time, the ideas now under consider-ation would seem incredible.   We should be taking a tremendous risk to Imperial Defence if we got rid ofthe arm with the greatest potentialities.   any suggestion for the abolition of the Air Force wouldresult in parents refusing to allow their children-5-
to make the Air Force a profession.   He asked ifit would not at least be possible, before making any announcement, to assemble a Five-Power Conferencein order to ascertain what use Germany intended tomake of her freedom?The Cabinet felt, however, that, in view of theFrench scheme and other developments at Geneva, itwas impossible to delay the issue of a Statementuntil a Five-Power Conference could be arranged.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Annex to the Declaration on germany&apos;s Claim to Equality of Rights(C.P.-377 (32), page 3, para.(3),headed &quot;Air Armaments&quot;) should include a paragraph opening the way  to theinternational exploration of thequestions referred to in the existingparagraph, quoted on the first pageof this Minute and marked A.(b) That the Drafting Committee of theCabinet should meet at once, withthe Secretary of State for Air, inorder to concert, in the light ofthe discussion at the Cabinet, a revised draft of the above paragraphfor consideration at the Meeting ofthe Cabinet to be held on the follow-ing morning.(c) That the Statement, as revised, should then be considered as a whole by theCabinet.3, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,(j        November 8, 1932,
