REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet 45(33), Con-clusion 4.)The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Reduction and Limits-tion of Armaments:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, covering a Resolution adopted by the GeneralCommission of the Disarmament Con-ference on July 23rd, 1932 (CP.-270(32)) .A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, covering a Statement published on Monday.September 19th, 1932 (C.P.-305 (32)).A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs on germany&apos;s claim &quot;to &quot;Equality of rights&quot;  (CP.-323 (32)).A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs on theEuropean Situation in relation to disarmament (CP.-326 (32)).The Cabinet met from 11.30 a.m, to 1.15 p.m.,.and from 2.15 p,.m. to 3.30 p .m.At the beginning of the discussion the Secretary,of State for Foreign Affairs, in elaboration of his memorandum (CP ,-326 (32)) made a statement to theCabinet emphasising the seriousness of the situation created by the withdrawal of Germany from theDisarmament Conference, and describing thosefeatures of German armament policy that areoccasioning so much anxiety in France.   Later inthe Meeting the Secretary of State for War, while not dissenting from the decision of the Cabinet onthe subject of &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot; (See Conclusion(a) below), uttered a grave warning as to theconsequences that might follow a few years hencewhen Germany, free from the military provisions ofthe Treaty of Versailles, was able to develop herarmaments to the point where she could pursue,by force or threat of, force, her undisguisedintention of rectifying her eastern frontier.
9 ^ QC k, 6On the various points submitted by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs the Cabinet agreed  (a) &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot;:   That the principleof equality of rights should be approved,and that its application, as indicated inthe Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs under the headings(A) &quot;Common Document&quot; and (B)  &quot;CommonDuration&quot;, could not be resisted.   Themethod to be pursued should be that suchequality should be expressed in the formof a programme and subjected to regulation and agreement during the term of theDisarmament Treaty.   At the end of thatperiod there would be. no distinction instatus between the ex-enemy Powers andother Powers:   thus the restrictions onthe armaments of the ex-enemy Powers, sofar as they are imposed by the Treaties ofPeace, will be&apos; brought to an end;(b) Germany and the Disarmament Conference:That British policy should be directed towards securing the return of Germany tothe Disarmament Conference:(c) That the withdrawal of Germany from theDisarmament Conference raises a problemof the hind that the Lausanne Declarationregarding future European co-operation, ofJuly 13, 1932 (Cmd.4131) was intended tomeet;    and that, with a view to carryingout the policy set forth in (b) above, theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should, in accord with that Declaration,approach the Governments of France, Germanyand Italy with an invitation to meet inLondon at an early date (e.g,, Tuesday,October 11th) for an exchange of views onthe situation created by the withdrawal ofGermany from the Disarmament Conference.At the same time the United States Govern-ment shotild be informed of this invitation,and the suggestion should be made,  in such manner as the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in consultation with the Prime &quot;&quot;Ministert      might deem advisable, that the presence of an american Observer (e.g., Mr Norman Davis)would be welcomed:(d) The Common List of Arms:    That the eonse-quences of Germany&apos;s continued absence fromthe.Disarmament Conference would be so serious that in the course of the discussions designedto bring Germany back to the DisarmamentConference, the possibility could not be ruled out that it might be unavoidable, toagree to Germany possessing some of the weapons prohibited by the Treaty ofVersailles, but that any such admissionshould be reserved to a late stage of thediscuss ions:(e) Air Forces: To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to accept the resolution adopted by the General Commission of the Disarrn-ament Conference on July 23, 1932, that &quot;air attack against the civilian population shallbe absolutely prohibited&quot;:
(f) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto accept in principle the secondResolution35 adopted by the GeneralCommission of the DisarmamentConference on the abolition of bombardment from the air, but should say that we do not deny that thereare difficulties in putting it into execution or that there is inconsist-ency in prohibiting air bombardmentwhile permitting artillery bombardmentat extreme ranges.   He should indicatethat the United Kingdom delegation were prepared to accept the Resolutionbut that they realised that in Committeedifficulties would be encountered:(g) Supervision:    That the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should beauthorised to accept in principle the Resolution adopted by the GeneralCommission of the Disarmament Confer-ence on July S3, 193S, on the subjectof Supervision&apos; , on the distinctunderstanding that the permanent disarmament Commission must nothave the right to act as a rovingCommission.    The objections of theDefence Services, as expounded atsome length by the ministers concerned   were recognised to have much practical force, but there wasunanimous agreement that these objections were outweighed by thepolitical considerations in favourof acceptance of the principle.It was also felt that the objections were mitigated to a great extent bythe considerations set forth inParagraph 5, 2, of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs&apos; memorandum cp.-326 (32)  (Extract reproduced inthe Appendix).The high contracting parties shall agree as between themselves that all bombardment from the air shall be abolished,subject to agreement with regard to measures to be adopted for the purpose of rendering effective the observance of this rule.These measures should include the following -(a) There shall be effected a limitation by number and a restriction by characteristics of military aircraft;(b) Civil aircraft shall be submitted to regulation and full publicity.   Further, civil aircraftnot conforming to the specified limitationsshall be subjected to an international regime(except for certain regions where such a regimeis not suitable) such as to prevent effectively
the misuse of such civil aircraft.4. Supervis ion.There shall he set up a Permanent disarmament commission with the constitution, rights and duties generally as outlined in Part VI of thedraft convention submitted by the Preparatory-Commission for the Disarmament Conference, withsuch extension of its powers as may be deemedby the Conference necessary to enable theconvention to be effectively applied.Whiteha11 Gardens,  S .W.1,September 30, 1933.
APPENDIX.C *i j.Extract from Memorandum on. Disarmament &quot;by the Secretaryof &quot;state for Foreign Affairs.    (CP. 326(32572*    Disarmament Control.      This also comes up immediately in challenging form.      The former Home Secretary,  in hisparting declaration (page 21 of Cabinet Conclusions 47 (32)),told us, as the fact is, that he had written a paper urging,under strict conditions, that the Disarmament commission should not be denied all power of inspection.     Our service departments are against the whole idea, largely I  thinkbecause they fear that the power might be abused for thepurposes of getting information or spying out the nakednessof the land.     There is undoubted force in these arguments,but the Cabinet must appreciate the strict limitations whichwill circumscribe the power.      Inspection could only take  -place (a) if the allegation of infraction was made on the direct responsibility of a State;    (b) if it was formulatedwith precise particulars, so as to prevent a roving Commission;(c) after which, the Disarmament Commission, consisting ofpermanently appointed individuals, would consider it and, ifnecessary, request observations from the Power accused;(d) after which, it is suggested,  they might report to theCouncil of the League, who would no doubt consider the matter further;    (e) with the ultimate result that the nomination ofan inspector might be authorised.      The argument that these limitations deprive the proposal of much of its danger isreinforced by remembering that the whole thing depends onacceptance by all the States at Geneva, including America.On the other hand, the Cabinet will appreciate that directopposition to anything of the kind from us is likely to bedisproportionately exploited. Moreover the French attachconsiderable importance to the power as a means of keeping-Germany in check. They think that even though inspectiondoes no good, the situation would be worse if you begin byagreeing that in no conceivable circumstances can there everbe any inspection at all.
