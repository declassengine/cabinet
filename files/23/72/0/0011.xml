2. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Postmaster-General (G.P*-3i7 (32))  covering the Report of aCommittee of Enquiry on the Post Office, 19 32.The recommendations contained in the Memorandum may-be summarised as followst-(i) That the Postmaster-General should,with the concurrence of the PrimeMinister, appoint a suitable Boardon the lines and with the dutiessuggested in the Report, and thatone of the first duties of theBoard should be to take such action as may be necessary and advisable to carry out the proposals generallyfor re-organisation set forth in theReport.    It being understood that,if the Postmaster-General finds on examination that any eliminationsor modifications in such scheme(including the Board system itself)are desirable, he shall make sucheliminations or modifications accord-ingly in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer.(ii) That the recommendation of theCommittee on the financial relation-ship between the Exchequer and thePost Office, which may involve legislation (either by a separate bill or a clause in the Finance Bill),should be adopted in principle,although further examination maysuggest the desirability of some modification in detail.   That this aspect of the question and the working out of any consequential re-arrangements which may follow in relation to theTreasury and the Post Office, be remitted to a small inter-DepartmentalCommittee under the Chairmanship ofSir Ernest Stronmenger,   This Committeeshould also advise as to the date fromwhich the change shall take effect.(iii) That any re-arrangements that may from time to time be necessary in the relationship of the Post Office tothe Office of Works shall be thesubject of discussion and adjustmentbetween the two departments as hitherto.(iv) That the Committee&apos;s conclusionsconcerning the relationship of thePost Office and Stationery Officebe generally accepted.(v) That the Postmaster-General shallstrengthen the personnel of the- 2 -
Advisory Council of the Post Officeand arrange that it shall be con-suited on matters of general policyin which the public are interested and enable its members to raiseitems for discussion on its Agendaas recommended in the Report.(vi) That the-Postmaster-General shall also re-examine the question of telephone charges in the light ofthe suggestions contained in theReport ,(vii) That the Postmaster-General shall beauthorised on an appropriate occasion to announce that the Government accept in principle the two main recommendations  -tions in the Report, and that it willbe one of the first duties of the newPost Office Board to examine sympathet-ically the recommendations as to re-organisation of a detailed character which are contained therein.After the Postmaster-General had made a statement onthe lines of the joint Memorandum the Cabinet discussed theproposals contained therein.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring to Recommendation (ii) above that the financial relationship between theExchequer and the Post Office should be adopted in principleexplained that the principle was that instead of all PostOffice profits being taken by the Treasury there should bea payment by the Post Office to the Treasury fixed period-ically.      He himself favoured the principle, but he was not sure that the $ommittee*s precise plan was right.      Itmight, he thought, lead to the possibility of divergence of view between the Treasury and post Office,which it was desirable to avoid.      Consequently, he reserved his opinon as to the Committee^ plan on that particular point.     Asuggestion was made that,in the disposal of the surplus,the Postmaster-General might be given instructions to consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer or even the Cabinet.
The Cabinet agreed. -(a) That the Postmaster-General should beauthorised to let it be known by alloongerned that the Cabinet regards theReport sympathetically,  and that it isto be considered and examined from that stand-point.(b) That the proposal in Recommendation (i) above that the Postmaster-General should, with theconcurrence of the Prime Minister, appoint asuitable Board,should be approved.(c) That the other Recommendations set forth above,including the Inter-departmental Committeecontemplated in (ii), on the financial relation-ship between the Exchequer and the Post Office,should be approved.
16MALTAfhe Languageuestion.previous reference:Cabinet 41(32), Con-clusion 5.)3. The Secretary of State for War,  on behalf ofthe Secretary of State for the Colonies, who wasunavoidably absent from the Cabinet, reportedprogress as to how matters stood in the Island of malta.On the 3rd October the Secretary of State for theColonies ashed the Law Officers to report whethercertain instructions recently Issued by MalteseMinisters with regard to the teaching of Italian inclasses of the elementary schools constitute   an infringement of the recent Letters Patent.   On the4th October the Secretary of State also asked the LawOfficers to advise whether it is Competent for HisMajesty, by means of further Letters Patent, toprovide that the Maltese Legislature should not havepower to pass laws relating to languages and publicinstruction in Malta, and to provide that either or both of these matters should become &quot;reserved&quot;subjects .   He also asked whether the department ofPublic Instruction could be taken over and administered by the Maltese Imperial Government, and the necessary funds obtained by means of an addition to the reserved Civil List.   If these objects could be attained by fresh Letters Patent, a further Act ofParliament relating to Maltese affairs this wintercould be obviated.The Prime Minister asked that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies should keep the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs closely informed of develop-ments of this kind at Malta at every stage, In orderthat the latter might take such steps as he might deem appropriate to avoid difficulties with theItalian Government.
I? POLICE PAY, 4.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-341 (32)) oirculat-(previous reference:       ihg a Note by the Treasury examining in detail theCabinet 48(32), Con-       proposed administrative economies in the Policeelusion 7 (a).)r-n Services.   The Treasury Note concluded as follows: -y.\.&quot;It is difficult to regard even asmuch as one half of the economiesas of a strictly continuing character.It is, however, only fair to add thatthe Home Office point out that the economies are contributed by not lessthan 180 separate authorities andthat, although a particular savingmay not recur in a particular police district, its place may be taken byother economies in other districts.They suggest that on balance theaggregate may well be maintainedover a period of years.   They alsopoint out that the savings are calculated by reference to thefinancial year ending 31st March,19 33, and that most of the measuresproducing savings under the head ofpolice strength take effect gradually.The savings under this head will be higher in the year October 1932 to october 19 33 than in the financialyear 19 32/3.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled thatwhen the subject was last discussed, the cabinet had agreed that the question would have to bedecided as soon as possible after the appointmentof the new Home Secretary.   With the authority ofthe Prime Minister, the Police Pay Committee hadbeen re-constituted so as to include the newMinisters, and had met on the previous evening   to explore the subject in the light of such informationas the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland were able to provide.   The Committeehad not felt in a position to make a recommendation to the Cabinet.   They had decided to put the factsbefore their colleagues and leave the Cabinet totake a decision.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer then proceeded to make a verbal report, which he opened by emphasis -ing the extreme gravity of the issues involved.The trouble had originated from the following decisionof the Cabinet on September 1, 1931:-&quot;(a) That in the ease of any Departmentrequired to effect economies in thepresent emergency, the department should have discretion, afterconsultation and in agreementwith the Treasury, to realise the economies in the best mannerattainable, provided that theamount so realised is not lessthan the economy figure as determined by the Cabinet.......,&quot;That decision was taken before the decision for the10% cut, and at that time the proposed cuts variedin respect of different Services and approximatedmore closely to those proposed by the May Committeeon Economy,   ^hen had come the Invergordon incident..The Cabinet had felt bound to make reductions in thecase of the Navy, and had decided that the cuts toother Services could not be maintained.    Consequentlythey had adopted a maximum and almost uniform cut of10%. - The Chancellor of the Exchequer then proceeded to quote a series of public statements by the lateHome Secretary, who claimed that,as those statementshad not been contested at the time by his colleaguesor challenged in the Cabinet, the Government as awhole were committed by them.   The first of these,made on September 4th to the Police Council, was asfollows:-&quot;We are not restricted, as I mentionedlast week, to the May Committee&apos;srecommendations,    So long as thefinancial result on which the Exchequerrelies is not affected we can vary theprocedure which may be adopted in orderto secure it;    and I have obtainedconfirmation of that from the Cabinet......&quot;That statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequerpointed out, contained no pledge and. named no figure,
but merely undertook to look into economies.On September 10th the White Paper containing theofficial statement of the Government&apos;s economy pro-posals was presented to Parliament.    It contained the following passage&quot;The expenditure on the police fallshalf on the rates and half on theExchequer and the Exchequer conse-quently receives half the benefitof any savings secured in the expendi-ture on this &quot;service.    Savings in expenditure amounting to  2,000,000are to be made in two equal instalments,the savings to the Exchequer being thus 500,000 in the first year and  1,000,000in the second year.   Some of this reduc-tion of expenditure will be secured bythe introduction of lower rates of pay    .for new entrants to the service and various administrative measures, butSavings of this order cannot be secured without substantial sacrifices on thepart of serving members of the forces.The May Committee recommended, a reductionin the pay of all ranks of &amp;s per cent,in the first year and 12g per cent, inthe second year, but after consultationwith the English and Scottish PoliceCouncils, on which the police authoritiesand all ranks of the Service are repre-sented, it has been decided to makeinstead deductions from, pay on a graduatedscale according to rank, commencing at5s. weekly for constables, whose scaleranges from 70s. to 95s. a week.   Thesedeductions will continue for a year fromthe 1st October, 1931,   Additional savings of similar amounts are to be secured inthe second year and will involve further substantial sacrifices on the part ofthe police, but the detailed measures are reserved for further consideration&quot;.On September 12th there was issued from the HomeOffice to Police Authorities, Chief Constables, thePolice Federation and the Police Press an approvedsummary of the Proceedings of the Police Council, i:which the following paragraph appeared:-&quot;So long as it was understood that additional savings of equal amount would be forthcoming in the second year, the Police Council wouldcertainly be given an opportunity toconsider the detailed measures&apos; to betaken.   The deductions from pay would accordingly be limited in the firstinstance to a year from the 1st Octoberbut would be renewable by further
regulation at such rate as might he found necessary after further review by the Police Council, and, in themeantime, all possible means ofsecuring savings by administrativeor other methods would be explored.&quot;This statement did not commit the Home Office to more than an attempt to find economies and to consult the Police Council.   mhe view taken of these assur-ances by the Police Forces was expressed in a leadingarticle in the &quot;Police Review&quot; of September 18th,1951, of which the following is an extract&quot;Some of the reduction in expenditure(we again quote the Memo.)  *will besecured by the introduction of lower rates of pay for new entrants to theService and various administrative measures  .... The detailed measures for effecting the additional savings of similar amount (i.e,, double thepresent saving) to be secured in thesecond year are reserved for furtherconsideration&apos; .   Among these detailedmeasures the Police are not by any means entitled to rule out the possi-bility of a further supplementarydeduction from pay.   The amount ofthis would depend upon the savingeffected by the introduction of lower rates of pay for new entrants and bysavings on administration.    Somehow orother a saving roughly equal to twice the present &quot;cut&apos;  is to be effected asfr om 0 ct ober, 19 32 .&quot;This extract, the Chancellor of the Exchequer pointedout, showed that up to this stage there was no difference of opinion between the late Home secretary and the Police Forces that the second cut was insuspension until the following year, and that certaineconomies might be set off against the cuts in pay.On September 21st the Prime Minister, after carefulconsideration by the Cabinet of the situation arisingout of the Invergordon incident, had made a statement which included the following&quot;^here are undoubtedly classes of personswho are unfairly affected, and theGovernment have, in view of all thecircumstances, come to the conclusionthat the simplest way of removing iustgrievances is to limit reductions asregards teachers, police and the three defence Services, to not more than10 per cent........n
This statement, said the Chancellor of the Exchequer,was understood by all branches of the Public service to be an unqualified pledge embodying the principleof equal sacrifice.   That announcement altered thewhole basis of the Governments policy.   Up to that point the percentage cut had varied in the case ofdifferent Services.   Now, however, all were brought down to 10$, and that altered the whole situation.The late Home Secretary, however, had taken adifferent view and had made the following statement on September 25th in the House of Commons:-&quot;Furthermore, the Home Office and thePolice Council agreed that instead ofthe whole of these economies fallingupon the pay of the various ranks ofthe force, as much as possible shouldbe effected by administrative economies?The late Home Secretary, the Chancellor added, main-tained that that statement had never been challenged by the Cabinet, who were therefore committed to it.At the Central Conference of the Police federation on November 12th, as reported in the &quot;Police Review&quot;for November 20th, the late Home Secretary made thefollowing statement:-&quot;The Police got respite so far as.one-half is concerned, and during that respite we want to considermost carefully whether it will notbe possible to make larger adminis-trative economies in Police expendi-ture, so that the money required bythe Exchequer shall not come whollyfrom the pockets of the members ofthe Force,We are going into that most carefully,and the Home Office is very much alive to the desirability of that object.We have received a number of suggestions which are being carefully examined.I can assure you that the Home office are very desirous of securing allpossible economies in order to avoid,so far as may be, the enforcement tothe full extent of the second half ofthe cut.&quot;
In the meantime the late Secretary of State forScotland had been giving assurances of a similarcharacter.   Prom, the above extracts there was nodoubt that the late Home Secretary was right inclaiming that he had committed himself towards thePolice to try and make administrative economiesto be set off against the cuts in pay, and that theCabinet were to some extent committed by these state-ments .The question now arose as to how far thosestatements justified the cutting down of the secondcut to the Police.At this point the Chancellor of the Exchequermentioned a complication which had arisen owing tothe claim of the late Home Secretary that the economyfor the second year of  2,000,000 to be realised bythe Home Office had been reduced, with the consentof the Treasury, to  1,750,000.   The document onwhich the late Home Secretary had founded this claim,and which he stated was in the files of the HomeOffice, was not to be found either in the treasury or at 10 Downing Street, although it was supposed to have been submitted, to the Prime Minister.   Piehimself had investigated the matter and had seen theOfficial of the Treasury (Sir Alfred Hurst) whosehandwriting appeared on the document, and otherOfficials.    It appeared that when the originalPolice cuts of an aggregate of I2k% had been reducedto 10$ the Home Office had aaowmod thaCoroallor&amp;o anomi^ 8 were require. Sir Alfred Hurst, theTreasury Official in question, had not made any suggestion on the subject, but the Rome Officeand Sir Alfred Hurst, without having any means of checking, had accepted it as an estimate.   As a matter-11-had estimated that
of fact when the outs in pay were made the G-overn-ment Departments were told that they must findother economies elsewhere:    that is to say, theHome Office was still under an obligation to find the full  2,000,000 of economies.    The chancellor had been informed by the present Home Secretary thatthe Estimates were being discussed on the basis oflsW\W j&quot; - c tf\J&apos; M*a-tfe4s-^i^asjjg^^Tha lower figure applied only to the&apos; V        rirot yisar^.    The late Home Secretary had used the document in question as an argument that heonly had to find  1,750,000.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer submitted, however, that  2,000,000was the proper economy to be found by the HomeOffice by one means or another.   The purpose of the document had not been to show what economy was to bemade, but what would be the effect of a reductionfrom 12*$ to log/7 JJ3&apos;Comment was made at this point that a reductionof  250,000 appeared to be based on some very rough calculation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer continuedthat the Committee had accepted the view that thepotu. xl-^economies could be set off against the second cutI&apos;fk*-tj   so long as economies were found by the Home Officeto the extent of  2,000,000.   The 10% cut, however,plus the pay of all new entrants, only producedeconomies of  1,600,000, so that there was ashortage of  400,000 on the  2,000,000.   TheTreasury had examined the proposed economies indetail, and found that about only half the savings could reckon as continuing savings.The Treasury admitted, however, that in thisrespect the savings by the Home Office did not^t
differ very widely from those of other Departments.Consequently the Chancellor asked the Cabinet to disregard this point.    Even so, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer estimated that, in order to carry outin the most literal sense the engagements of theHome Secretary, it was necessary to make a cut of something slightly more than 4^%,   The Chancellorreported that the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland were prepared to take responsl-bility for whatever the Cabinet decided.   They hadbeen warned, however, that the consequences might be serious ,   The possibility could not be ignored of a police Strike, which might be timed to coincide withtro\ible with the unemployed:    the calling out ofthe military to maintain order;    and of members ofthe Police Forces taking advantage of their rightto pension and thus increasing expenditure;    to say nothing of great uneasiness in the House of Commons.That was one side of the question;    though, if 2,000,000 a year was accepted as the proper cut the Government could not be accused of any breach of faith if they imposed a cut of 4^%-.On the other side of the question they had toconsider not merely the view of the general publicbut also that of the Fighting Services, Post Officeofficials, Teachers, Civil Servants of all kinds,doctors and chemists, who universally believed thatthe 10  was based on the principle of equality ofsacrifice.    If it was argued that a relaxation wasto be made in the log in the case of a particularlywell-paid and well-found Force, it would beimpossible to resist the claims of other services to a corresponding relaxation.   The public were-13-
drawing the conclusion from the success of recentConversion operations, and. so forth, that there wouldhe some remission in taxation next year.    So far ashe could judge there was more likely to be a deficit of  20,000,000 in the present Budget and he could see no possibility of a reduction in taxation withouteconomies.    How could he ask for fresh economies ifconcessions were being made to the Police?Considerable discussion took place as to theextent of the cut to which the Home Office was committed, which was recognised to be a point of some importance.    There appeared to he no dodbt that theHome Office had been working on the assumption thatthe total economy was  1,750,000,    mhe Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, however, made it clear that there hadbeen no official alteration in the figures in theWhite Paper, and that Sir Alfred Hurst denied everhaving given permission to cut down the original sumof  2,000,000.There was general agreement that the late HomeSecretary had interpreted the mind, of the Cabinetincorrectly, but that, as no-one had challenged his statement at the time, he had technically committedthe Government.    It was suggested that in debate theimposition of the 5% cut could be justified in some such terms as the following&quot;It was generally admitted that the 10^all-round cut was a fair one.   TheGovernment as a whole never intendedto depart from it,   there is no doubt,however, that the late Home Secretarydid to some extent, even though withoutauthority, commit the Government to adifferent view in respect of the Police.In spite of that, however, the aggregate of Police economies would only justify a reduction in the.second cut from theoriginal 5% to 4^%.    ^hat difference ofS% was not worth adopting, and conse-quently the Government proposed toimpose the full cut of B%%
This proposal met with much support, though itwas pointed out that the late Home Secretary wouldclaim that the total economy of the Home Office hadbeen reduced from  2,000,000 to  1,750,000.In this connection the Secretary of State forScotland quo.ted Sir Herbert Samuel&apos;s statement in the House of Commons on September 25, 19 3$, asfollows&quot;Lastly, the change announced by thePrime Minister on the 21st Septemberhas reduced all round the cuts that were previously proposed, and the consequent reduction of savings willbe about  12 0,000, reducing thereceipts in England and Wales to 780,000.   That is for the first year&quot;..Interested parties, the Secretary of State remarked,would certainly draw the deduction from this state-ment that the  2,000,000 figure of the White paper had been subjected to some reduction.The Cabinet were informed also that the presentHome Secretary was not in a position to deny that conversations had taken place both within the HomeOffice&apos;and with the Treasury on the basis of thelower figure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out,however,  that these discussions had related to theestimates for the year, 193^3S*, and. nota-\  l*AvC cL  tL*.   $Ctru fU**j ?2j tnrOr cns&amp;   arat-j    h   h   Ju &amp;J&amp; cthe second year,&quot;10fee 33-.During the subsequent discussion the trend ofthe Cabinet&apos;s view was strongly in the direction ofthe adoption of some formula based on that insetabove.    At this point, however, the Home Secretaryannounced that since he had been in the Cabinet Roomhe had received fresh information to the effect that large numbers of returns were being received at theHome Office from the Police Authorities, containing
proposal? for economies ,  .60 of these had been examined and contained aggregate economies of some 35,000,    It was conceivable that, when all the returns had been examined, that figure might riseto  150,000.The Cabinet realised that this fresh informationmight seriously weaken the argument in favour of imposing the full cut of 5%^ and the question was felt to require further investigation.The Cabinet agreed -(a) ^o adjourn until 4,30 p.m,(b) That the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary ofState for Home Affairs andthe Secretary of State forScotland should meet in the interval and make fullerenquiry into the wholequestion, including thenew factors brought to notice by the Home Secretary.,  ,  ,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 12, 1932,
