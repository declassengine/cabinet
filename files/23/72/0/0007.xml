the national government .designationof Liberal[Ministers.the ottawa conference.fiPrevious9 Reference:JOabinet 46I(32), Con-jj elusion 1.)1    The Cabinet resumed their discussion (begunat the Meeting referred to in the margin) on the ottawa Agreements.   The Conference documents hadnot been available at the earlier Meeting, buteertain decisions had been taken upon the assumption,based on the information then available, that theAgreements were approved.   The Home Secretary,however, had entered a caveat that the discussionmust be regarded as of a preliminary character,since full details of the Agreements were notavailable and there had been no time for consulta-tion.   Pending a fuller opportunity for considera-tion of the question he had made reserves for his friends and himself ,on the whole policy concerningthe Conference.At the present Meeting the following Paperswere before the cabinet a Summary of the Conclusions ofthe Conference and the texts of thevarious Agreements, together withthe respective Schedules (C.P.-298(32)).   These Schedules had so far been withheld from publication, inorder to avoid risk of forestalling,and the document, therefore, was ofa most secret character.A most secret Note by the PrimeMinister (0 .P.-312 (32)) covering a letter from the Home Secretary&quot;dated September 16th.    In this lettera reasoned statement was given of the considerations which had led Sir HerbertSamuel and his friends to the conclusionthat it was impossible for them to approve the Ottawa Agreements.    Inthese circumstances, and in view oftheir anxiety to maintain the present political combination under the leadership of the Prime Minister,the Home Secretary and his colleaguesmade the proposal that judgment onthe Ottawa Agreements should be postponed until the results of theWorlds Conference were known.   If theCabinet decided to ask Parliament to implement the Ottawa Agreements beforethe World Conference took place, theywould be reluctantly compelled toplace their resignations in the PrimeMinister^ hands .-1-
A record of a Conference held onSeptember 7th under the PrimeMinister&apos;s Chairmanship (CP.-297(32))    at which the drafting ofthe Ottawa legislation had beendiscussed and the parliamentary time-table considered.A Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP.-295 (32))dealing with the regulation of meat imports in relation to theinternational obligations of theUnited Kingdom..A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP,-316(32)), in which the conclusion wasreached that it would be unsafe to rely on the proposals of the Presidentof the Board of Trade in CP.-295 (32)for overcoming the international difficulties connected with the regulation of meat imports.A Note by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries (CP.-299 (32)) covering a Memorandum asked for by the cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin, on the price to the consumerof the proposed duty of 2/- per quarteron foreign wheat.A Note by the Secretary of State forIndia (CP.-313 (32)) covering aMemorandum on the Agreement reached at Ottawa between the Indian and united Kingdom Delegations,A Note by the President of the Boardof Trade (CP.-315 (32))coveringNotes on the advantages accordedimmediately under the Ottawa agreements in favour of United Kingdom goods,The discussion at the Cabinet Meeting was confined almost entirely to the issues raised bythe Home Secretary&apos;s letter of September 16th(C.P.-312 (32)) ,The Lord President of the Council opened thediscussion at the request of the Prime Minister,and confined his remarks mainly to the political consequences of the Ottawa Agreements.   He saidthat the aim. of the United Kingdom Delegation at ottawa had been to obtain freer trade within theEmpire in the hope of promoting freer trade in theworld.   He and his colleagues believed that that
object had been achieved.   They believed also thatthey had removed the imminent danger of the absorption of Canada into the economic orbit ofthe United States of America, with all the serious consequences entailed thereby, such as the closing of Canada to British trade and ultimately to Britishimmigrants .    Instead, preferential advantages toour traders had been gained in the Canadian market,which, until quite recently, had been regarded as animpossibility.   This was a great economic advantage to the United Kingdom.   He believed also that the fiscal co-operation of the Empire had been achieved at the last moment at which this was possible.   Hadthe Conference failed, the various units of theEmpire would have drifted apart and it would havebeen too late to re-assemble them.   He admitted that considerable statesmanship would be required tomaintain the fiscal unity of the Empire, and he realised that some of his colleagues attached more importance to this than others.   The Lord Presidentalso expressed the belief that the various agreements would be ratified by the Parliaments of the Dominions,.That would render the more regrettable any fissuresin the attitude of the Government of the UnitedKingdom,   Nevertheless, he understood to a certain extent the difficulties of the Liberal position.He himself, however, had only regarded the ottawa conference, important as it was, as one of severaloutstanding questions which, in the aggregate,perhaps made the difficulties of the National Govern-ment greater than before.     Unemployment was worse than ever, and the National Government were about toenter on their second winter.   People took shortviews on these matters.   Though perhaps we were a-3-
good deal nearer recovery than we had &quot;been before,many people found themselves worse instead of betteroff and were feeling the pinch.   Consequently, if an election took place at the present time they might-vote against the National Government.   Anotheroutstanding question was the coming World Financialand Economic Conference, which rendered an unbrokennational front desirable.   A third question was India,which was perhaps the most important and difficult ofall.    This question was at a very difficult stage,since before long the National Government would bepresenting to Parliament the legislation to implementprevious negotiations.    It was impossible to over-stress the importance of presenting that legislationwith unanimous support, and the existence of. a three-Party Government might make a good deal of difference.He regretted the prospect of the loss at that moment of the Under-Secretary of State for India, and thepossible reaction on the opinion of Indian Liberalsof the resignation of his Liberal colleagues.   Thiswould tend to give an impression of weakness at atime when an appearance of strength was- desirable.The&apos; Lord President then referred to the peculiarposition of the Prime Minister, and recalled thesituation in 1931 when, at the shortest notice, theNational Government had to be formed.   At that time there seemed a possibility that his own Party mighthave had a victory at the polls.   He himself, however,simultaneously with the Liberal leaders, had feltthat in the national interest they ought to supportthe Prime Minister, the present Lord Chancellor, theSecretary of state for Dominion Affairs and the lord privy seal, who were facing a position of nationaldifficulty with the greatest courage.   At that time-4-
the Prime Minister, who did not know him then aswell as he did now, had, not unnaturally, foreseenthe risk that he might he thrown over a little later.The .lord President had replied that, if so, his party would have to throw him over too.    Since then he and his friends had worked for the nation, withoutconsideration of Party politics.   They had felt it,was their duty to pull the country through;    andfrom the first he himself had felt that it would be premature to think out the re-alignment of Partiesbefore next year;    in fact, they had &quot;signed on forthe voyage&quot;.   All this made him sad to think that now, when the National Government was confronted with so many difficulties, some of his colleaguesfelt that they could not continue.   He had not hadan opportunity of consulting his own colleagues onthe subject, but he felt sure that he was expressing their views in stating that he had no desire foranyone to leave the Government, and if they adhered to their decision to do so he would regret it mostprofoundly.The Home Secretary (Sir Herbert Samuel) thankedthe Lord President for his concluding words.   As oneof the three who had taken the decision at buckingham palace in 1931, he regretted that the combinationwas likely to come to an end.   The Ottawa conference had brought matters to a head.    If there had been noOttawa Conference, or if it had ended differently,the present crisis need not have arisen.   Supposing,for example, that the Ottawa Conference had endedwith reductions in tariffs and no increases, inaccordance with the original intentions of theUnited Kingdom Delegation, there would have been noreason for him and his friends to leave the Government,-5-
He recalled that the resolution declaring that a general reduction of world tariffs should he a purpose to he pursued by the Governments of the British Empire had been rejectedwhen put to the Ottawa Conference, and Mr. Bruce had recentlystated that Ottawa had brought.__a.bout no substantial change inthe fiscal policy of Australia.      If he found himself boundto resign, he would state the case that the disadvantages ofthe Ottawa Agreements outweighed such advantages as there werein extended freedom of trade.     This was not the occasion onwhich to elaborate this argument, but he mentioned one or twospecific points.      He did not think the Ottawa Conference could make much difference to the tendency for Canada to be drawn into the orbit of the United States, since many of the factor-ies in Canada were owned by Americans.      He concurred that theIndian Agreement conferred some advantages,, but our cottonexport trade, the greatest British commercial interest in India,gained no advantages.     Lancashire&apos;s troubles were due largely to Indian tariffs, but their position was not improved byOttawa.     Among other disadvantages the Home Secretary mentioned the termination of the Russian Trade Agreement,  to which he andhis friends attached importance.     He concluded this part ofhis statement by reiterating that his main point was that the disadvantages outweighed the advantages, in which he found thathis view was confirmed by such reliable economists as Sir ArthurSalter and Sir Walter Layton.Turning to the argument that the Ottawa Agreements had been necessary for the salvation of the Empire, the Home secretary said that he did not assent.     He recalled that the late mr.. Joseph Chamberlain had repeatedly urged, nearly thirty years ago,  that we were then at the parting of the ways andthat his policy of Imperial Preference was essential to thepreservation of the Empire.     The policy was not adopted..The Great War had then come and had shown the immense strengthof the loyalty of the Dominions to the Mother-Country.     He and
his friends held very strongly that it was not an advantage to try? by such Agreements,  to keep the Empire togetherfiscally.     This was more liable to lead to its break-up.He recognised the sincerity with which the opposite view washeld, but he was equally confident that the trade interestsof the component parts of the Empire were not complementarybut,    in various particulars which be mentioned, were diverse,and that it was not advisable to try and combine them byagreements between Governments.     In fact, the attempt to unite the Empire in a fiscal sense was a danger to theEmpire.     The 1930 Imperial Conference had broken down onthis point, and the Ottawa Conference had reached the vergeof a breakdown.      There might come a point one day when somedivergence of opinion on some question of wheat or meat wouldbecome a real danger to the Empire.     If he were asked why,if he had accepted the &quot;agreement to differ&quot; in January hewas not prepared to continue under the same arrangement now,he had two replies:    first, the effects of the ottawa agreements were far more serious even than those of the tariffs imposed earlier in the year;    they restricted theright of the House of Commons to amend fiscal duties;    theywere to bind our hands for five years and must prejudice theresults of the World Financial and Economic Conference.Second, the immediate object   for which the National Governmenthad been formed - the rescue of the country from the dangersthat had been imminent, had been accomplished by the balancingof the Budget, the cessation of borrowing for the UnemploymentFund, securing the safety of the   Sterling and the re-establishment of the national credit.     He agreed that theGovernment was faced with many difficulties at the presanttime - perhaps more, even, than usual - but that was an argument that could, in greater or less degree, always beused.      .    Unemployment, he agreed, was
considerably greater now than when the national government came into office, but this, he and his friends maintained, was largely due to theProtectionist policy of the Government.   They couldnot remain in office to screen the Government from apublic discontent which they felt to be justified.If the/psa-esMMfcfc policy succeeded they could not claimcredit for it.    If it failed, they felt that they ought not to be expected to share the responsibility.Turning to the argument that the national government was necessary from the point of view ofthe coming World Financial and Economic Conference,he said that, supposing they remained in office,foreign nations would easily see through thefiction that the Government was united.    So far as india was concerned, he and his friends intendedat a^-&amp;a*ly moment to emphasise their complete agreement with the policy of the Government andtefa^ir i-n-tontiOR to keep the Governments foreignpolicyIndian policy out of &quot;fee controversy sofar as they were concerned.    They agreed that therewere some disadvantages in their resignation fromthe point of view of international affairs, andthey recognised that the position of the PrimeMinister was entitled to consideration.   When thecountry had voted for the National Government theelectors had said, that so long as the Government uj&amp;aagreed they would support them.   The country had put the various Parties in office together in orderto adopt an agreed policy.    In India .and other important matters they had adopted a common policy,but on fiscal matters there had been no common policy .   All the sacrifices had come from the FreeTraders.   This had been true of the Abnormal Imports-8-
Act, which they had consented to with great reluctance;of the Wheat Quota?    and of the general and permanentTariffs.      On this latter question they had offered theirresignations hut had been persuaded to stay on the agreement to differ.      Since then additional Duties had been imposed,but they had kept silence.     The Conservative fiscal policy had been carried out in all respects.      This was what had led the Home Secretary and his colleagues to suggest that onthis occasion,  if it was desired that the National Governmentshould hold together, the sacrifice should come from theother side and that further progress with the ottawa agreements should be suspended until after the world economic and Financial Conference had been held.      He admitted that that would mean a good deal of upheaval and new arrange-ments with the Dominions5   but if it were so important thatthe National Government should hold together, why should it not be done?   The Government,  in international affairs, had always urged the abolition of prohibitions and restrictionson trade.      Six of the countries, including ourselves, had now agreed to a Convention to prevent any new prohibitionsof imports or exports.      Even that relatively small result would be rendered nugatory by the Ottawa Agreements,  and thePresident of the Board of Trade had shown that the meatrestrictions proposed at Ottawa would involve our givingnotice next year to withdraw from that Convention.      At theWorld Economic Conference if any groups of countries showed a readiness to enter into agreements with us for the gradualestablishment of complete freedom of mutual trade, we shouldhave to reply that we were prohibited from accepting by the ottawa Agreements.     He and his friends regarded the tieingof the hands of Parliament for five years as unconstitutional,and would not hesitate to say so.     He would add that theposition would be intolerable if the Ottawa legislation wasproceeded with and they remained in office, and that persons of recognised
authority, such as Lord Grey and Lord Or ewe andothers, supported this view.   That was why,3=38^ he had felt constrained to make theproposal contained in his letter to the PrimeMinister (C.P.-312 (32)) to which he had alreadyalluded.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that before he expressed his views he would like to discuss theHome Secretary&apos;s compromise.The Prime Minister said that he had examined the proposed compromise and found that in practice it was impossible to adopt it, for the reason that by October 13ththe various Agreements had to be published/, and to publish them without carrying them out immediatelywould destroy their value.   The Dominions Parlia-ments were meeting to pass the necessary legislation.If the whole of the Agreements were suspended for six months it would cause great difficulties andagitation.The Home Secretary said that abstention frompublication would be an., essential complement tohis proposal *The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that the date of publication had been fixed for October 13th.   The Australian Postmaster-General had resigned owing to the decision of theCommonwealth Government to give effect to areduction of tariffs.The Prime Minister said he was willing toconsider anything reasonable and practicable, butthis proposal did not seem practicable, though hewas ready to listen to a discussion on the subject.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said his view was that there was no possibility of a compromise on thes e lines .
The Lord Privy Seal said he spoke for no Partybut only for himself.    He was deeply touched by theLord Presidents statement.    It was an illustrationof that genuineness and honesty which he had learnedto appreciate during his association o&quot;p the last 13months.   whatever other results followed from hisleaving the Government, he was glad that his associa-tion had led him to know his colleagues so much betterHowever much they might differ in the future, andhowever much hard-hitting there might be, he had a feeling of genuine respect for all his colleagues,and it was agreeable to him to recollect their kindlyassociation.   The reasons which led him to resignhad already been fully and admirably expressed bythe Home Secretary.   lie agreed with him and hiscolleagues that tfeey could no longer be associatedin the Government.    It was not only on the ottawa agreements that he disagreed with his colleagues.In all these fiscal matters his own position had.been very difficult and irksome during the last many months ,   He had accepted the agreement to differwith reluctance.   At that tune Protection had notgone very far.   Wow the cumulative effect of thevarious measures amounted to a full system ofProtection.   Even apart from Ottawa he felt thatthere was a case for reconsideration of the positionowing to the change in the fiscal conditions of thecountry.   This had been brought home to him asmeasure after measure was introduced making hisposition more and more intolerable.   There was one point he wished to mention in advance,  in case there was any misunderstanding hereafter.   This wasthat the pledges made at the last Election by thePrime Minister and himself had not been maintained-11-
and had certainly been violated.   He did not thinkthat,  on its Election pledges, the Government had any mandate for Protective measures .   He did not fora moment suggest any moral turpitude on the part ofhis colleagues ,   He knew that his Conservativefriends had not deliberately flouted   these pledges,but they were so obsessed with belief in the merits of Protection that they had unwittingly slipped into these measures .   He hoped this would be rememberedwhen he made his criticisms .     He wished to associatehimself with the Home Secretary in his intention to promise support in all matters in which.the national government had been in unanimous agreement, such as their Indian policy;   but in matters where they hadbeen in disagreement he felt bound to criticise.For months past his position had been growingimpossible owing to the taunts that he was supporting the Government in proposals with which he disagreed.He left the Government with deep regret, but with thewarmest feelings for all his colleagues, and withthe promise of support in those matters in which they agreed.The Prime Minister wished he could find some wayto keep the Government together for another stage.He knew the difficulties of some of his colleaguesduring the last six months, and to some extent heshared them.   Ever since he had seen this crisisapproaching he had been doing his best to examinethe situation, including his own attitude.   He had considered, withdrawal and other expedients.   At theend, however, he had: found it impossible to squarea sense of duty with any form of withdrawal orresignation.   He felt bound to go on to the world economic Conference, and he had felt.that after that-12-
was the right time to review the work of theGovernment.   He was not persuaded that theresults of the Ottawa Conference made the World.Conference impossible.   Had that been the casehe would have felt that the matter was very serious.His own view was that if anything was to result from the work of the Government it must emerge from the World Financial and Economic Conference,which would pick up the threads of Lausanne andOttawa and other activities of the Government,-andcombine them.    It was with this in view that inJune last he had done his utmost to get the world economic Conference to London, and he had done this  .on the assumption that the National Government wouldtake charge of that Conference;    and now the Confer-ence was actually coming to London and there was noNational Government to take charge of it.    another matter in which he had felt that he could helppersonally,  though not in the capacity of a private member of Parliament, was In the settlement of theAmerican Debt .    After all the preliminary work inthis matter that had been done privately he couldnot possibly follow the Lord Privy Seal and his other colleagues in the action they were taking today.As to the Election pledges, if they had not beenfulfilled it would not be the first time that he had had to say that the good he had done was not all thathe had aspired to, and that the evil he had been compelled to do was owing to conditions which he couldnot foresee or control.    It had not been necessaryfor him to co-operate with the National Government to discover the truth of that, which showed a flaw in the moral creation of the world. There had undoubtedly beenpolitical considerations in the minds of all, except per&quot;haps the Lord Privy Seal, who was in a position of special-13-
freedom.   He knew what these events meant to himself and his friends.   At the next Cxeneral Election thenowLiberal Party/seceding from the Government wouldnot bless them.   Neither, perhaps, would the Liberalswho were remaining in the Government;    nor the conservatives-.    He had friends, and he would standby them to the end.   All these matters had- to betaken into consideration.    Some people said he wasimprisoned to the conservativeiParty.   He-admitted that he was imprisoned  - not to the conservative party, but to national circumstances.    It would benecessary for his colleagues, if they wished him tocontinue in the new circumstances, to say so, for he held his present position in virtue of a documentsigned by the Lord President of the Council, theHome Secretary and himself.   The Home Secretaryfelt that the conditions of that agreement had beendeparted from.   That changed the nature of theGovernment.    Consequently the Home Secretary&apos;resignation to himself was a cancellation of theconditions on which he had come into office.   Thenature of the Government changed from the moment atwhich the resignation was handed in.   Consequentlyhis colleagues must tell him if they were to continuetogether.    It would be necessary to have programmes to meet the new situation, Unemployment policy, andso forth.   He was, however, perfectly willing, if a one-Party Administration were preferred, to resignhis position.   He would only regret it on the sideof national duty.   mhe initiative, however, must come from his colleagues.   There were one or two matters in which he felt he could be helpful, namely,Americanthe/Debt, and the World Financial and EconomicConference.    He and the Lord Privy Seal were old-14-
oolleag-ues:    sometimes they disagreed, hut generallythey found themselves on the same platform.   He said,therefore,  to his friends who were resigning, thathe was sorry he could not follow them.   He thought they were wrong and that they should have heldtogether a little longer.The Lord Chancellor said that a year ago he had found a leader in the Prime Minister and he intendedto stick to him.    If some of his colleagues did not see eye to eye with the remainder of the Cabinet,their difference was only on one question.   On all others he would value their intimate and confidentialadvice, which could not be given in Parliamentbut only round the Cabinet table.   Without their presence the difficulties of the Government would beincreased.    It would make the task of England harder.He felt sure that all present would regret thattheir colleagues could not remain to continue their help and advice.The Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir archibald sinclair) regretted the decision that had to be takentoday.   He assented whole-heartedly to what theHome Secretary had said of Ottawa and the general political situation, and he deeply regretted hisseparation from colleagues who had shown him personally so much consideration.   The fact wasthat the Tariff issue went to the heart of the&apos;wide range of the Government1s policy.   referring to points mentioned by the Lord President, hecommented that Tariffs went to the heart ofUnemployment; and that, so far as the World Confer-ence was concerned, the Inter-DepartmentalPreparatory Committee was constantly running up against difficulties created by the Ottawa Agreements.
In CP.-516 (32) the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs characterised as  &quot;palpably disingenuous&quot;the solution of the difficulty propounded by thePresident of the Board of Trade.    So far as india was concerned, the resigning Ministers would be atpains  to show the strength of their support to theGovernment. .    .ja-ouos that our)pog%.....woul-d-bo tfro-mpro of f oe-^-a^zugHe expressed deep regret at separating from thePrime Minister, under whom it had been a greatprivilege to serve.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that the same guiding principles as haddetermined the Prime Minister to remain in officeinfluenced him also, and he believed this was true of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe President of the Board of Trade.   Twelve months ago he had taken his decision to stand with thePrime Minister because he felt that the nation was more important than Party.   The bitterness of the attacks on him since then had convinced him that anything which helped to put the Opposition in power would be disastrous to the country.   That wasdecisive from his point of view.   He also had offered to resign, but on different grounds fromhis colleagues .   He had thought it might be better for the Conservatives to take over the Government.He wished to emphasise that at Ottawa considerations of Party advantage had never entered the minds of anyof the United Kingdom Delegates .   They had consideredevery question from the point of view of a national government.   Replying to the criticism of the-16-
tariffs involved in the Ottawa Agreements he pointed out that the policy of high tariffs had broken down under the pressure of the UnitedKingdom Delegation and. as he had already mentioned,had led to the resignation of an Australian Minister.He referred also to the success in inducing the SouthAfrican Government to denounce their commercial treaty with Germany.   While paying a high tribute to the absence of rancour from the present discus-sion, he said he had felt it necessary to make clearthat his colleagues at Ottawa had never beenunmindful of the difficulties of others.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that everyone present must be under a sense of duty and high responsibility.   He had done his best to study these questions, more particularly fromthe international point of view.   He did not disputethat the Ottawa Agreements raised certain complica-tions, but he did not believe these to be insuperable.The real point was as to what course could best betaken to help in the present difficult situation,fie thought that many people would say that a unitedCabinet had agreed to send seven of their member as Delegates to the Ottawa Conference.   Even if theresults in some details were disappointing, in theaggregate they were very remarkable.   In particular,the Agreement with Canada conferred great advantages in the better treatment of British manufacturers.It could hardly be suggested that any other membersof the Cabinet could have got better results .    Ifthey had come   back without agreement, in whatrespect could things have been better?   When theHome Secretary suggested that the situation, even iftemporarily grave, was better than when the national government came into existence, he himself felt that-17-
the withdrawal of their colleagues would creategreat difficulties for Great Britain&apos;s influence.He did not see how the Prime Minister could take adifferent course, and he wished he could persuadehis dissenting colleagues that the best thing forthe country was for them to stand by the PrimeMinister.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that anyone attending an International Conference couldnot fail to see the importance of the Governmentstanding together as the National Government.   Itwas a pity that they should break up over what was a family quarrel.   The most important international conference was still to come.   That meant the PrimeMinister would lack the support of one great politicalelement in this country.   He recognised the difficult position of the Home Secretary, who had to face gibesand taunts;   but he thought that he should rise tothe position before the Government at the comingInternational Conference and put first the difficultiesof the country ,The Home Secretary said he did not mind gibesand taunts, and was not influenced thereby,    If theposition were as it had been in January he would have continued.   It was not an old political quarrel thatwas influencing his attitude^. \t widowing to theifcseLJ- *&quot;        KWorld Conference^that he felt bound to resign.   Atthe moment when we entered the Conference, when we ought to be getting rid of tariffs and restrictions,the National Government would be just emerging fromthe passage of legislation in exactly the opposite direction.   He could not share the responsibilityfor that position.   Replying to the argument that because the Government had agreed to send a Delegation-18-
employment   &apos;ANCE.$leans Test.fousPence:et 46y Con-^ion 14).to Ottawa they ought to support the results of the Conference,he recalled that when the Cabinet&apos;s Ottawa Committee had suggested that it might be necessary to assent to taxes onfoodstuffs, he had given a warning that he could not support this, but had not felt it right, however, to resign at thattime, because it would have been breaking up the national government on a mere hypothesis that might never materialise.He also recalled that before the Delegation had left forOttawa he had expressed the hope that if he and his friendscould not support the Agreement, his colleagues would not feel that they had let them down.      It had also been recorded in the Cabinet Minutes that in fact no Minister was committed in advance (Cabinet 44 (32), Conclusion 4).      The HomeSecretary himself had raised, at the Cabinet held just beforethe departure of the delegates for Ottawa, his objection toa long-term Agreement to maintain particular rates of Duties,and this had been recorded in the Cabinet Minutes.      he hoped,therefore, that no-one would accuse him and his friends of disloyalty because they had allowed matters to proceedso far and had not resigned earlier.     The Home Secretarythen stated that there were one or two other questions towhich he felt it necessary to refer, for purposes of avoidingsubsequent misunderstanding, before he resigned his post.The first of these was the Means Test.     There was noquestion of suggesting its abolition, nor did he demur tothe action taken by the Minister of Labour in supersedingcertain authorities Who had been guilty of abuses.     Hiscriticisms related to certain comparatively minor points ofadministration,  involving no considerable expenditure.His ideas had been expressed early in the year in letters to the Minister of Labour.     He had objected to a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry inLancashire on March 1st to the effect that applicants forUnemployment Transitional Allowances were to be &quot;treatedexactly like applicants for public relief&quot;.

Con-^on 4).c* the had prepared a Memorandum for the Cabinet and sent itto the Prime Minister, but he had thought that it had better not be circulated at that moment.     On August 2?with the Home Secretary had mentioned his misgivings at theCabinet, and the Minister of Labour had reported that theearliest date at which the Report of the Royal Commissionon Unemployment Insurance was likely to be received wasthe third week in October.     On September 21st he had written a letter to the Prime Minister and had told him thatas the present Meeting of the Cabinet was likely to be his last, he would like to have this question cleared up, and had suggested that his Memorandum of June 3rd should now be circulated.     The Prime Minister still thought, however,that this was not necessary.     He did not ask for a dis-cussion now, but he wished the Cabinet to know that if hecriticised publicly the action of the Government in thismatter he was not criticising the general policy, in whichhe agreed, or the Administration generally, but only certaindetails.     He was anxious that there should be no misundei&quot;-standing, and that it should not be said that he would beraising in public for the first time points on which he hadbeen silent while he had been a member of the Government.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs expressedthe hope that, as the Home Secretary had not felt sufficientlystrongly on the matter to disagree with the general policy,he would npt now make it more difficult for those who had tocarry out the policy.The Home Secretary said he would be very careful in what he said.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said hewould like to take the opportunity to clear up the attitudeof the Home Secretary on Disarmament.     He understood thatthe Home Secretary approved of the policy set forth in his recent Statement on the German claim to equality.- 20 -

He himself mighthave drafted it differently? but he had not criticised itand did not propose to do so.There were two points on Disarmament on which he haddiffered from some of his colleagues.      First? in respectof Budgetary Limitation? on which his action at Genevahad been criticised;    and second? on the question of power to check allegations of infractions of the Disarm-ament Treaty by investigation on the spot.      This was amatter on which he had written a Memorandum? and to whichhe had referred at the last Meeting of the CabinetCommittee..       Some naval questions might require more detailed consideration? but apart from the above two points he had no disagreement with the Gorernment&apos;general Disarmament policy.Ttie Prime Minister said that if a question of thiskind were to be raised? there was no question on whichhe could say that he had seen eye to eye in all respectswith his colleagues.The Prime Minister? however? said he felt boundon the present occasion to draw attention to a statement in a Memorandum (CP.  319(32)) which the Home secretary had just circulated to the Cabinet and which was actuallyon the Agenda Paper for that day&apos;s Meeting (item 5).In paragraph 7 of that Paper the Home Secretary statedthat on October 12,  1931?  the Treasury had sent to the- 21 -
Prime Minister  for his information, a statement of theamount anticipated from the Police economies,, revisedas a result of the alteration in. the cut of 12% per centoto 10 per cent., and that this statement gave a figureof  1,750,000 in place of the previous figure of 2,000,000.      The Home Secretary had added that a copywas sent at the same time by the Treasury to the HomeOfficei    that it was now on their files, and they hadbeen working on that figure ever since.      He himself hadbeen looking into this matter, and found that no copy -had ever reached him.      He had been out of London at thetime as it was during an election, but his Secretarieswere very careful and could find no copy.     Also no copyof the letter could be found in the Treasury, accordingto the information received that morning.The Home Secretary said he had relied on Home Offioefiles and had had this Paper before him when he was .writing his Memorandum.      It was stated on the paper that it was a copy of a Memorandum which had been sentto the Prime Minister for information.      The endorsementwas, he had been told,  in the handwriting of Sir AlfredHurst, of the Treasury.The Prime Minister said that this could not beused as an official document,  as it had never beenapproved officially.      He gathered that there had been some conversation between Departments, with proposals and suggestions, but that the letter in question had never come before the Permanent Head of the department and had not been seen and approved.      It could notrank as an official document.The Home Secretary said he could not be made responsible for arrangements within the Treasury.Every Minister must be entitled to assume that a document emanating from the Treasury and placed on thefiles of his Office could be regarded as official.- 22 -
ft A f*ebbThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said the real question was as to whether the Memorandum was a replacement of theWhite Paper.      His enquiries so far indicated that it wasnoto      He was making further enquiries?, hut he believedthat the figures were for estimating purposes only..The Prime Minister said that the reason he had mention-ed the matter was that he was alleged to have been implicat-ed in the document?  and this did not appear to be the case.He wanted to say that? to the best of his belief? he had never seen it.The Home Secretary said he had not had it in mind thatthe Prime Minister himself would be aware of such a document?particularly at a time of crisis of the kind that had thenexisted? but he had merely quoted the endorsement as itappeared upon the paper0The Prime Minister said that he could not use anendorsement as a criticism of what had taken place.The Minister of Labour? reverting to the question ofthe Means Test?  asked if he was right in supposing that sir Herbert Samuel would have no objection to his makingpublic use of his letters.The Home Secretary said he had never thought of makingpublic use of correspondence between his colleagues and himself? though he would not object if the Minister ofLabour wished to use his letters.      His only object hadbeen to make it clear that if he did offer criticisms itwould be on the matters which he had already mentionedpreviously.The Prime Minister said he hoped the discussion wouldnot end on any note of dispute.      He felt sure he was
interpreting the opinion of the Cabinet as a whole thatit was impracticable to suspend legislative potion onthe Ottawa Agreements.     He expressed the utmost regret atthe sequel.      He was deeply conscious of the fact of losing colleagues who had worked in so well with theCabinet, and he regretted that they were not going to face the winter together,,The Home Secretary thanked the Prime Minister and expressed regret at the conincidence that it was theSecretary of State for Scotland and himself who, becauseof their offices, were the Ministers who were concerned inthe question of Police Pay which had given rise tocontroversy.      He expressed his warm appreciation of allthe Prime Minister and the Lord President of the Council had done to keep the Cabinet together in the last year.The Cabinet then adjourned until 2.50&quot; p.m.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.September 28, 1932.
