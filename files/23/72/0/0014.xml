9 f* Q[police pay.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(32), Con-elusion 3.)The Prime Minister said that this Meeting hadbeen called to receive a verbal report on thequestion of Police Pay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that on Friday the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland had given theCabinet Committee an account of their meetings with the Committees of their respective PoliceCouncils .   These meetings had gone off ratherbetter than had been expected, especially so inScotland.   There had,  of course, been some criticisms,but in the main these had taken the form of objec-tions on the lines of the original objections tothe cuts in pay.    Conseqxiently the fl^wogwmont temihad &quot;tio ^A  jMJiJ^f -in H^aityfeainin^; its position.He then quoted the recommendation of the Committee,which was as follows:-&quot;To report to the Cabinet on thelines suggested by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, namely, thatafter having heard the accounts ofthe meetings between the HomeSecretary and the Secretary ofState for Scotland with theirrespective Police Councils, theCommittee saw- no justification for the re-consideration by theCabinet of the decision previouslyreached, that the second. 5 per cent,cut should be imposed in the case ofthe Police Forces.&quot;Continuing, the Chancellor of the Exchequerexplained why it had been thought necessary forthe Cabinet to be summoned to consider the question.The Cabinet Committee had felt that, in all thecircumstances, this was the more appropriate course and that the Police should be informed that thequestion had been considered first by the CabinetCommittee and then by the Cabinet .
The Prime Minister expressed the hope that any communication to the Press might be cotiched insympathetic terms .The Home Secretary said that the Communiqueon the subject was rather lengthy, but that great care had been taken to avoid any brusqueness.He proposed to issue the Communique&apos;&apos; the same evening to the Press through the usual channels,and at the same time to send a letter to thePolice Authorities as well as to the Local Author i-ties.   He agreed to a suggestion of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs that as a matter ofcourtesy he should see the late Home Secretary onthe subject .The Secretary Of State for Scotland,  in replyto a question by the Prime Minister, said that thePolice Authorities in Scotland had questioned thefigures, and eventually he had decided that it wasexpedient to use the discretion given him by theCabinet to give a pledge to the Scottish police council that if the Police economies throughout great Britain exceeded  2,000,000 the surplus shouldbe handed back in some form to the Police.The Prime Minister asked the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to circulate to those of his colleagues who were concerned, the shorthand-notes recordinghis pledge, so as to remove all possibility ofmisunderstanding.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the recommendation ofthe Cabinet Committee that therewas no justification for re-consideration by the cabinet of the decision previously reached that the second 5 per cent, cutshould be imposed in the case ofthe Police Forces:
(b) That the Home. Secretary and theSecretary of State for scotland should be authorised to announce the decision of the Government inthe Press the same evening, and tomake appropriate communications tothe Police Authorities and to theLocal Authorities:(e) That the Home Secretary should endeavour to see his predecessorin office and inform him in advanceof the decision of the Government:(d) That the Secretary of State forScotland should circulate tothose of his colleagues who were concerned, the shorthand-notes of the pledge he had given to theScottish Police Council that ifthe Police economies throughout great Britain exceeded  2,000,000the surplus would be handed backin&apos;some form to the Police., Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 24,  1932.-3-
