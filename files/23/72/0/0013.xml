Reduction and limitation of armaments,The Disarma-ment Confer-ence.(previous reference:Cabinet 50(32)? Con-clusion 5.)$$(yd fI. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-347 (32)) setting forth his convictions on the threatened crisis in Disarmament Policy and urging the Cabinet to reach very promptly a positivedecision on the subject:    otherwise he feared thatthe consequences would be incalculably grave both to international peace and to the fortunes of theNational Government,   After considering in detailwhat would be involved by the failure of the Disarm- &apos;ament Conference, the Secretary of State was satisfiedthat the only means was to take and to announce avery bold decision, in consultation with the Frenchbeand Italians,  of what we would/prepared to do. this declaration should take the form that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are ready, if all other Governments will do the like, to adopt and apply the principle of equality of rights in the following three respects:-(i) The limitations on Germany&apos;s armamentsshould be contained in the sameDisarmament Convention as the limita-tions of the armaments of others .(ii) The newly-expressed limitations .in thecase of Germany must last for the sameperiod and be subject to the samemethods of revision as those of others.(iii) We must declare for the principle that,as part of the new Disarmament Convention,there shall be no kinds of arms whichare forbidden to Germany, while theyare permitted to other States .Inasmuch aa any extension of the list of Germanarms was bound to lead ta re-armament and a newcompetition, the Secretary of State took the viewthat the proper form of the declaration ^rould be thatwe are prepared to accept the principle, if other states will de the like, that we content ourselves.with those kinds of arms to which Germany is nowlimited.   Assuming there were an Anglo-French--1-
Italian declaration to this effect, he felt that public opinion would recognise that this was anadequate meeting of the German claim to equalityand would discountenance all forms of German rer-armament sThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs madea statement in the course of which he emphasised the importance, internationally as well as domestic-ally, of the Government providing themselves with adequate plans to meet the-Disarmament situation.Representations were being made by a very large body of public opinion demanding (l) that GreatBritain should &quot;give a lead&quot;,  oblivious of thepractical lead, we had already given;    arid (2) thatGermany should, not be prohibited from the &quot;kind&quot; as distinct from the &quot;quantity&quot;  of arms that were allowedto other countries.The Prime Minister said that, though reluctantly,he had to agree with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s diagnosisof the situation.    A position was being created, thatwould overwhelm the Government if it was not met.On the following day he had to meet several Deputa-tions on the subject, and a few days ago he had.received an impressively sound Address, appended towhich were the names  of leaders in many branches ofour national life.   A position had been reached wherethe Government could not base its decisions on theadvice of Experts only, but must take public opinioninto account.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister theCabinet agreed -  -  -That the following Ministers should confer on the subject of Disarmamentthe same afternoon at 3-30 p.m., inthe Prime Minister&apos;s Room at the Houseof Commons :-
The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty.
^PERSIA. 2. At the request of the Secretary of State forIRelations with. Air, the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsHen jam Island. made a brief statement to the Cabinet on the subjectP.R. of the negotiations for a Treaty with the Persian5s(S-j^b Government.   The latter had recently made a demand- -that we should evacuate Henjam at once .   We had declined to do this at short notice, but it wasimpossible for us to ignore a notice to quit an island that was admittedly Persian, and before longwe should have to find accommodation elsewhere.The First Lord of the Admiralty warned theCabinet that the evacuation of Henjam would involvespendins a good deal of money on another island(Bahrein), to which Persia also laid claim.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out, however, that the Persian claim toBahrein was strongly contested and was not in thesame order as their undoubted right to Henjam.-The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to circulate ashort Appreciation on the position for the information of the Cabinet.
POLICE PAY. 3. The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that he had already sent to the Prime Minister and the(previous reference: Chancellor of the Exchequer the draft of a statementCabinet 52(32), Con- that he and the Secretary of State for Scotlandelusion 2.)proposed to make to the respective Committees of thePolice Council.   Both he and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland had had to consider what should be their attitude if, having announced that they were ready to keep the pledge made on behalf of theGovernment by the late Home Secretary,    they were asked whether any balance that there might be afterproviding the full amount of the economies mentionedin the White Paper would be handed back to thePolice.    It was not at all likely that there wouldbe a balance, and if there was one it would be so small as to be probably not worth handing back tothe Police.    Both Ministers felt, however, that itwould much strengthen their hands if they were allow to state that any surplus would be returned.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that an amended estimate showed that thesurplus was not likely to exceed  8,500.   Thatestimate was drawn on the assumption that the Policecut was for 11 months instead of 12.   At first hehad hoped that it might be possible to set off anybalance of that order against the  60,000 accruing to the Police owing to the postponement of the secondeconomy cut until November.   He had now ascertained,however, that the late Home Secretary had surrenderedthis sum unconditionally.    In the circumstances hethought that the Ministers concerned might safelypromise that if there was any material surplus itwould be returned to the Police.   He felt that thiswas reasonably safe from the point of view of the
*i 4 Vother Services, since the saving would be for oneyear only.   He was willing, therefore, that theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland should be allowed to give that assurance.The Prime Minister put the suggestion, for theconsideration of the two Secretaries of State, thatif there were a small surplus it might be possibleto return it to the Police by reducing some proposedeconomy.    This would ease the situation from thepoint of view of other Services.The two Secretaries of State undertook toconsider the sxaggestion.After some further discussion on procedure, theCabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretaries of State for home Affairs and for Scotland, in meeting the Committees of therespective Police Councils, shouldbe authorised to state that theestimates of economies had been examined very carefully and did not lead them to expect that there wouldbe any surplus after providing the economies laid down in the white paper.    But if these anticipationsshould prove incorrect and thereshould be a material surplus, itwould,  in accordance with the lateHome Secretary&apos;s pledge, be returnedto the Police:(b) That the two Secretaries of state should consider the proposal that possibly the best way of returningany surplus that might accrue wouldbe by the remission of some economy:(c) That the two Ministers should meetthe Committees of the Police councils in London.and in Scotland respectivelyon Thursday, October 20th;    that if,after the figures had been communicated,the Committees asked for an adjournment,they should, in the first Instance, be offered an hour or two in which to study the figures;    but that if furthertime was pressed for they should agreeto adjourn until Friday morning:(d) That the two Ministers should reportthe results of their meetings with theCommittees of the Police Council   tothe Cabinet Committee on Police Pay,if possible, on Friday October 21st;
but if the Secretary of State forScotland was not able to return toLondon by that date the meeting should be held on Monday, October24th:(e) That the Cabinet Committee shouldbe authorised to take a decisionon behalf of the Cabinet with aview to an immediate announcement by the Ministers concerned, iinless .new factors should arise necessitatingfresh consideration by the Cabinet,
9i nO i i$IHE MEANS TEST .        4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (C.P.-345 (32))  drawing((previous reference:       attention to the uneasiness, both among the Govern-Cabinet 46   &apos;(32), Con-       ment supporters in Parliament and in the country,elusion 14.)as to certain aspects of the administration of theNeeds Test in regard to claimants for transitional payments ,After setting forth the grounds for this uneas i-ness the Minister suggested the following:-(i) That legislation should be introduced as soon as possible to amend the Orderin Council so that in the assessment of need in the case of claimants fortransitional payments -(a) not more than 50 per cent, ofdisability pension should betaken into account&apos;(b) not more than 50 per cent, of workmen&apos;s compensation shouldbe taken into account:    and(c) in regard to realisable assets(other than house propertyoccupied by the applicant)which are normally taken intoaccount, the first  25 of valueshall be disregarded, and thevalue up to  300 shall be takeninto account at an assumed income of 1/- per week in respect ofeach complete  25.   In the caseof house property occupied by theapplicant, the rental value shouldbe taken into account.(ii) That the operation of the Bill shouldbe limited to the period expiring nextJune, when many of the existing provi-siohs of the Unemployment insurance acts expire and before which legislationdealing with the whole problem must bepass ed.(iii) That the Bill, instead of incorporatingthe Minister&apos;s specific proposals andthus showing clearly the limits of the modifications he proposed to theexisting Order in Council, should confer powers on the Minister ofLabour.to make regulations on thethree points mentioned in (i) above.Parliament should be informed that inmaking the regulations the minister would pay attention to the recommenda-tions of the Royal Commission, making clear, if the Report is published beforethe Debate, that his regulations will-B-
in fact &quot;be based on the recommenda-tions of the 0ommission on these points,(iv) That the Government should refuseto be hurried into a decision uponfar-reaching proposals on thequestion of relief to able-bodiedunemployed, both insured and uninsured,that are likely to be contained in theReport of the Royal Commission, whichmay be expected in two or three weeks .(v) That the Minister of Labour should beauthorised to announce the intentions of the Government as soon as possible after the meeting of the house ofCommons.In addition, the Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum circulated by the Minister of Health(C.P.-348 (32)) late on the previous evening,commenting on the Minister of Labourfs Memorandum.Among other observations the Minister emphasised that if strict Public Assistance principles wereto be relaxed in the case of persons in receipt of transitional payments, the practice in the areas concerned in regard to ordinary Public assistance would undoubtedly be brought into conformity.The Minister of Health also gave a number of reasons for the doubt he felt as to the necessityof a temporary measure pending a final measure fordealing with the administration of transitional payments, and, perhaps, all able-bodied relief aswell,The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a statement to the Cabinet on the proceedings of the CabinetCommittee on the Eing&apos;s Speech on the subject ofthe Means Test, as well as on certain wider proposals that had been discussed by that Committee.Details are on record in the Minutes of the King&apos;sSpeech Committee (K.S.C. (32) First Meeting).
The Minister of Labour also made a statement in which he gave his reasons in favour of theintroduction of a Bill during the present Sessionof Parliament rather than its postponement untilthe next Session.After the Cabinet had received the abovereports the subject was adjourned, in order thatthe Cabinet Committee on the King&apos;s Speech might continue its investigations with a view to a reportto the Cabinet.
