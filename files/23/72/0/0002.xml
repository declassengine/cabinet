1,      THE MINISTER OF LABOUR drew the attentionof the Cabinet as a matter of urgency to thefollowing question by Commander Marsden, M..P. ,which, by request, had been deferred until Thursday,7th July:-&quot;To ask the Minister of Labour, if hewill refuse to grant a permit to CaptainErnst Hashagen to land in this Countryfor the purpose of broadcasting hisexperiences of sinking British and alliedmerchant shipping during the last warwhile in command of a German U-boat&quot;,In May last the Ministry of Labour hadreceived an application for the grant of a permit to Captain Hashagen, and, as the Ministry had no power to refuse a permit except on employmentgrounds, which were not applicable to the case, thepermit was granted as a matter of course.      Theproposal that Captain Hashagen should broadcasthis experiences had aroused very strong feelings,and it would be a very great mistake if the broadcastwas allowed to take place on Friday next, July 8thas was at present contemplated.      The PostmasterGeneral was empowered, on giving twenty-fours hours&apos;notice in writing, to prohibit the giving of aparticular broadcast; but this power had never, infact, been exercised.General agreement was expressed with the viewthat it would be very undesirable to have recourse tothe statutory powers of prohibition in this case, as this would be represented as the exercise by theGovernment of censorship powers, which should be definitely reserved for use in cases of great national emergency.     On the other hand, it was clearly most undesirable that Captain Hashagen should beallowed to broadcast&apos;his experiences of sinking
British and Allied merchant shipping during thewar, while commanding a German U-boat;    not only because of the feelings of pain and resentment: towhich such a broadcast must give rise among thosewho had lost relatives as a result of german submarine action, but also because we had alwaysvehemently anathematized this particular form of warfare.The Cabinet were informed that if an intimationwas given to Sir John Reith that in the view of theCabinet it was undesirable to allow Captain Hashagento broadcast, the matter would undoubtedly be disposed of without the necessity for having re-course to any statutory powers.The Cabinet took note that the Lord Presidentof the Council would confer with the Post-master General in order that the views of theCabinet might be communicated forthwith toSir John Reith.

(Cabinet 41(32)Conclusion 4 ;.and Appendix II),THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL read tothe Cabinet the following telegram, which he had just received from the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs :-&quot;Personal,,&quot;It would make an enormous difference to the&quot;reception of our proposed statement on naval&quot;disarmament if we could indicate the&quot;possibility of non replacement of capital&quot;ships in 1937 0     Knowing your personal views&apos;.!I enquire if this is possible.    It might be&quot;effected on page 6, paragraph 7, fifth line1!after &quot;future construction&quot; by inserting &quot;if&quot;replacement takes place thereafter&quot; and then&quot;continuing &quot;has been fixed etc,&quot;    This&quot;insertion leaves entirely open our future&quot;policy but I cannot exaggerate how muchI1 difference it might make to the American&quot;attitude towards us not only at Geneva but&quot;in connection with outcome of Lausanne,&quot;The Prime Minister, Mr, Chamberlain and&quot;Mr, Banciman agree,&quot;In the.course of discussion, a further telegramfrom the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to theLord President of the Council was received, and was read to the Cabinet.   (For the terms of this telegram seeAppendix I.)
The Cabinet examined the proposed alterations in the Disarmament Statement and adopted the alterationsand amendments subject to the following exceptions andqualifications:-Paragraph 40      The Cabinet preferred the originalwording5 namely &quot;the United Kingdom find them-selves in full accord with the spirit which hasinspired the latest proposals of President Hooveryon the ground that it was not accurate to say thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government are in full accord withthe &quot;substance&quot; of the proposals,,Paragraph 5 (d)9      The Cabinet preferred theoriginal draft sub-paragraph on Tanks to the revised paragraph for the reasons set out inAppendix II to these Conclusions.Paragraph 8, line 9.       The Cabinet preferred theoriginal draft of this sentence which reads asfollows :-   &quot;The American proposal is for areduction in number, namely, from 15 capital ships to 10:    it would thus leave the size of theseenormously expensive vessels untouched.    Not onlyso, but guns of 16&quot; calibre would remain in any future construction of capital ships.&quot;    TheCabinet thought that the figures and language ofthis original text would greatly impress publicopinion at home.Table of Naval Tonnage Reductions.     After hearinga statement from the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Cabinet agreed that it was essential that theproposed announcement should contain a plain andexplicit statement of the ultimate increase in the
Cruiser tonnage,,      They, thought that without this inclusion the proposals were disingenuous,and they recognised that the attempted concealmentwould certainly he detected,, As our Cruiser require-raents are well known to the Americanss and as weshall certainly he questioned on the matter at home,the effect of the omission will he most damagingand will cast doubt on the sincerity and franknessof the whole arrangement,,       The Cabinet, therefore,agreed unanimously that either this table should beretained (which seemed to them the simplest plan),or that a statement should be included, saying interms that this increase in Cruiser tonnage is anessential part of our proposals.Non-replacement of Capital Ships in 1957.    It wasagreed that the proposal in this telegram that our declaration should contain an indication of thepossibility of non-replacement of capital ships in1937 was open to the strongest possible objection.On the conclusion of their examination of the revised draft Declaration, the Cabinet invited the Secretary of Statefor War and the First Lord of the Admiralty to draft atelegram to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,containing the conclusions reached by the Cabinet in regardto this matter.     Later during the Meeting, this draft telegram was read, to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State forWar.

The omission of the words &quot;by diminishingtheir number or&quot; after &quot;either&quot; in line of paragraph 8 of the proof attached to cp. 243 (32) was a printer&apos;s error inLondono    The Geneva text of the document is correct in this respect.6.
nnHE SITUATIONa THE IRISHRl&apos;:: STATE,m REPLY TOJf DE VALERA &apos; SgSPATCH OPTLy 2nd.previousReferenceJabinetI F- .3.     With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin the Cabinet had before them a Note(Paper CP.  242(32)) by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,  circulating the draft of a despatch to Mr. de Valera in reply to his despatchof the 2nd July.After explaining the reason why it was thoughtundesirable to make no reference in this reply tothe fact that in the United Kingdom Declarationaccepting the &quot;Optional Clause&quot; of the 19thSeptembers  1929, we had specifically excepted inter alia disputes with the Government of any other-member of the League which is a Member of the British-Commonwealth of Nations, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs suggested&apos;to the Cabinet that the reply should contain some reference to Mr. Dulanty&apos;sletter of the 4th July, which had contained theintimation that the Irish Free State Government wassetting aside the monies received by them for  the land annuities and other charges in separate suspenseaccounts in anticipation of arbitration.The Cabinet examined the draft reply annexed to cp.  242(32)  and approved it,  subject to the followingalterations s-(i)    paragraph 6 on page ivs the last sentenceto read as follows.-   &quot;If,however,  they can be given an indication of the grounds uponwhich these Agreements arechallenged and are consideredsuitable for reference to arbitration. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United kingdom will consider the possibility of agreeing to the arbitration ofthose questions on the same basis, and by the same tribunal,as they have already proposed inthe case of the land annuities.
The Cabinet agreed;-That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should be authorised to send toMr. de Valera forthwith the despatch inthe form of the draft approved by theCabinet,  for the terms of which seeAppendix III.8.(ii)    The addition at the end of the draftof a paragraph in the following termss-&quot;I would add that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom were- glad to learn from Mr, Dulanty&apos;s letterof the 4th july&apos;s which reached me duringthe. course of the Debate in the House ofCommons on the same day,  that the moniesreceived by the Irish Free StateGovernment for the Land Annuities andother charges are being set aside bythe Irish Free State Government inseparate suspense accounts in anticipation of arbitration,&quot;
SITUATION INTHE IRISH FREESTATE.THE LOUGHFOYLENEGOTIATIONS.4.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs reported to the Cabinet that an official of theMinistry of External Affairs in Dublin proposed toconfer with the officials at the Dominions office on the Lough Foyle fishing question.    He (theSecretary of State) proposed to treat this asan inter-official matter, and not to regard it asfalling within the principle    that in presentcircumstances there must be no negotiations betweenthe United Kingdom and Irish Free State Governments.The Cabinet took note of and approved theaction which the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs proposed to take inregard to this particular question.9.
5. In pursuance of the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had before them a Noteby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(Paper CP. 235 (32)) covering a Memorandum by theDepartments concerned as to the specific commodities to be subject to duty on the coming into forceof the Irish Free State (Special Import Duties) Act.The Memorandum in question pointed out thatthere were two courses open, namely:-(a) a general duty on all imports from theIrish Free State;    and(b) a duty on selected commodities.The first course, while avoiding anyquestion of discrimination between different classesof goods, was open to serious administrative objections.The second course would produce a revenue ofapproximately  3 millions per annum, provided that therate of duty was 20% ad valorem on the specificcommodities named in the table in paragraph 3 of theMemorandum.     These commodities are, however, mainlyfoodstuffs.After pointing out that an additional dutyof, say 10/- per standard barrel on beer, would yieldabout  500,000 per annum, and that if account wastaken of this yield it was estimated that a duty onthe commodities named in the table at the rate of16 /3rds per cent, would suffice together with thespecial beer duty to produce approximately  3millions, it was suggested as an alternative that a duty of 20 per cent, on the articles enumerated inthe table might be imposed, and that the duty onbeer might be held in reserve if the 80 per cent.duty proved insufficient, or a larger sum that . 3 millions was required.10.
The Commissioners of Customs and Excise drewspecial attention to the complications which must inevitably arise in the customs administration on theland frontier in Northern Ireland when the new dutiesare imposed.It is for consideration whether the Government ofNorthern Ireland should be taken into consultation inregard to administration before the new duties come intooperation,,The Committee also had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (Paper CP.  236 (32))covering the draft Order for bringing the new duties intoforce.The Cabinet were reminded that if Mr. de Valeracarried out the threat contained in his latest Despatch,the annual loss that would have to be recouped by theGovernment of the United Kingdom would be  5-g- millions, andnot  3 millions.It was generally a greed that If no agreement vrasreached in regard to the reference of the questions at issue to arbitration, the most effective and impressive procedure would be to -issue the Order immediately after the royal assent had been given to the Irish Free State (SpecialImport Duties) Act.     In this connection mention wasmade of.the possibility of Mr. de Valera arranging for animmediate General Election,     In this event it would benecessary to consider the desirability of inserting in theOrder a rate of duty substantially in excess of 20 per cent,ad valorem.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR TAR informed the Cabinetthat he would endeavour to arrange that the Bill should pass through the House of Lords on Monday, July 11th.      In this event if, as seemed probable, the Cabinet met on Tuesday,July 12th. it would then be open to the Cabinet to determine the precise time for.the issue of the Order, etc.11*
The Cabinet agreed :* (l) To approve the draft of the proposed order to he made by the Treasury underthe Irish Free State (Special ImportDuties) Bill as annexed to CP. 236 (32).(2) To postpone a decision respecting the issueof the Order in question until the Meetingof the Cabinet to be held at the beginningof next vreeko12
6,      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (paper cp.  239(32)) by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, relative to the serious position in theDoncaster Drainage District,  the Drainage Board for whicharea is a special Board created under the Doncaster Act,1929.In the events which have happened, the DoncasterDrainage Board are quite unable to find  the moneynecessary to carry out works likely to obviate floodingof their area, and it is imperative that provision shouldbe made to transfer the powers possessed by thisDrainage Authority, especially as regards the coalmining industry, to some authority whose financial resources will enable them to deal with the situation.With the acquiescence of the Doncaster DrainageBoard, the Yorkshire Ouse Catchment Board and the TrentCatchment Board have applied to the Minister for amending legislation to transfer the pov/ers of the Doncaster board to themselves; and in view of the urgency of the matter the Minister proposed that the necessary provisions should form the subject of a special Bill for the amendingof the Doncaster Act, to be introduced in the autumn session.    This Bill would be mainly non-contentious and,as it would have to follow the Private Bill procedure, itwould take up little Parliamentary time.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES   stated thatit was important that some indication of the intentions ofthe Government should be made before the House rises, andhe accordingly asked for authority to announce that theGovernment proposed to introduce and pass into lawamending Legislation in the Autumn, on the understandingthat the adoption of this course would not prejudice the
introduction of a more general Bill amending the land drainage Act, 1930, after the New Year.The Cabinet agreed?That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should he authorised forthwith to announce in the House of Commons thatthe Government proposed to introduce andpass into law a special Bill for amending    &quot; the Doncaster Act in theAutumn Session.
7.     7/ith reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin the Cabinet had before them aMemorandum (Paper CP.241(32)) by the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury circulated by directionof the Lord President of the Council, statingthat agreement had now been reached with theStaff Side of the National v7h.it ley Council onthe subject of the Civil Service remuneration.The terms of settlement were incorporated in aMemorandum attached to C.P.241(32)  and were inaccordance with the proposals approved by theCabinet, except that the figure 35 had beensubstituted for 40 as the lower limit of the zone in which Civil Service remuneration is to remainstabilised at its existing level.Authority for this modification had beengiven in the course of the negotiations, as amatter of urgency, by the Lord President of theCouncil during the absence, at Lausanne, of theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet agreed:-To take note of and. approve theterms of settlement embodied in theMemorandum attached to CP.241(32)which had been reached on the subjectof Civil Service remuneration.

10.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP.  234(32))relative    to the question of the prohibition onthe construction of submarines by Germany.It was explained in this Memorandum that theAdmiralty also contemplated that Germany should begiven a time limit to the Disarmament Clauses ofthe Peace Treaty, if, in return, she would acceptlittle or no increase on the Versailles Treatyfigures for a short-term treaty.    It should also be part of such an agreement that Germany accepted the limitations of the Standard Category System, whichwould not permit transfer from surface craft tosubmarine tonnage.Subject to the above conditions, the Admiraltydid not suggest that the absolute prohibition on theconstruction of submarines by Germany ought to bemaintained.The Cabinet took note of the views of theAdmiralty contained in Paper CP. 234(32) with regardto this matter.

APPEND IX    II.DISARMAMENT   POLICYTELEGRAM TO THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR FOREIGN affairs as APPROVED AT THE MEETING OF THE CABINET TO-DAYWEDNESDAY, JULY 6th 1932The Cabinet have considered your proposed alter-ations in the Disarmament Statement, and make  the following comments :-Your paragraph 4.      The Cabinet would prefer theoriginal words.    It is not accurate to say that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are in full accord with the&quot;substance&quot; of the proposals.Your- paragraph 5 (d),    &apos;   The Cabinet prefer theoriginal draft sub-paragraph on Tanks,    They think youramended form beginning as it does with an affirmationthat they are &quot;entirely at one with President Hoover&quot;in desiring the application of the principle thatspecifically offensive weapons should be prohibited, andending with the statement &quot;but as I have already said weare in entire agreement with President Hoover as to theprinciple which he   seeks to apply to the subject of tanks&quot; seems like an assertion that they only seek toretain light tanks as not being specifically offensive,and that if they could be persuaded that any tank above a certain weight was offensive, they would be prepared to abolish it.      This is not the fact.    The retention of thelight and medium size tank is vital to a non-conscriptarmy, and could not be abandoned.      Further, 20-tons is-the limit which we have publicly adopted and which theAmerican Experts at Geneva are themselves willing to accept.
5J5Your paragraph 6, line 9.      &quot;The American proposal would leave the size of these enormously expensive vessels,and the calibre of their guns untouched in any futureconstruction of capital ships&quot;.     The Cabinet prefer theoriginal, draft.      They think the figures and language ofthe original will greatly impress public opinion at home.Table of Naval Tonnage Reductions.      The Cabinet thinkit quite essential that the announcement should contain aplain and explicit statement of the ultimate increase in the cruiser tonnage.     They think that without this inclusion theproposals are disingenuous.      The attempted concealment will certainly be detected as our requirements are well known tothe Americans, and as we shall - certainly be questioned athome, the effect will be most damaging and will cast   doubt on the sincerity and frankness of the whole announcement.The Cabinet, therefore, have decided unanimously that, eitherthis table should be retained (which seems to them the simplesplan) or that a statement should be included saying interms that this increase in cruiser tonnage is an essential part of our proposals.The other suggested modifications in the statement are accepted.Your Telegram No. 47.      The proposal to indicatepossible non-replacement of capital ships in 1937 we regard as quite impossible.
APPENDIX IIIDespatch as approved by the Cabinet at Meetingon Wednesday, July 6th,  1938.Downing Street,July, 1938.kster for External Affairs.Sir,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No.95 of theSnd July in reply to my despatch No.137 ofthe 22nd June regarding the question ofarbitration in relation to the Land Annuities.2.       As I made clear in the Debate inthe House of Commons on Monday, the 4thJuly, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom are most sincerely anxious to arriveat an amicable settlement of this matter.3.        The form of tribunal which HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom have proposed was that recommended at theImperial Conference of 1930 and, for that reason, this form of tribunal still seems
to them to he the most appropriate.Nevertheless, they are ready,, in orderto arrive at an amicable settlement, toconsider any variation in the form oftribunal which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the Irish Free State may wish tosuggest, so long as its members are drawn from within the British Commonwealth.4.    The difference between the twoGovernments on the question of arbitration in relation to the Land Annuities is,therefore, narrowed down to this singlepoint, which, as between two Members of theBritish Commonwealth, cannot possibly, in theview of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, be regarded as involving an artificialor unreasonable restriction.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom would makethe most earnest appeal to the Irish FreeState Government not to allow the   /
possibility of a friendly settlement ofthe Land Annuities question to breakdown on this one point.5.     As regards paragraph 4 ofyour despatch, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom do not feel thatfor their part it would be necessaryfor them to obtain parliamentary ratifi-cation of an agreement for the reference of the matter in question to arbitrationbut if His Majesty&apos;s Government in theIrish Free State would prefer that any agreement an the subject should be made subject to parliamentary ratification on both sides, they would not wish to offerany objection.6.      In regard to the other payments referred to in paragraph 3 ofyour despatch No. 95 of the 2nd July,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United
Kingdom, have not been informed of the groundon which the liability of the Irish FreeState is disputed.    If, however,  they can begiven an indication of the grounds upon whichthese Agreements are challenged and are considered suitable for reference to arbitration.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom will consider the possibility of agreeing tothe arbitration of those questions on the same basis,  and by the same tribunals  as they havealready proposed in the case of the land annuities.7. I would add that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom were glad to learn from Mr.Dulanty&apos;s letter of the 4th July, which reachedme during the course of the Debate in the House ofCommons on the same day,  that the monies   receivedby the Irish Free State Government for the land annuities and other charges are being set asideby the Irish Free State Government in separatesuspense accounts in anticipation of arbitration.
