RFDUCTION and limitation OFARMAMENTS.   I:(Previous   !&apos;Reference:Cabinet 59(32) .)1.   The Cabinet had before them a revisedparagraph (CP.-385 (32)) which had. been preparedby the Drafting Committee in consultation with theSecretary of State for Air, as requested by theCabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin,in substitution for the first paragraph of section(A)(3), &quot;Air Armaments&quot;, on page 3 of CP.-377 (32).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he understood the Secretary of State for Airrequired a slight alteration.   He thought it wasonly a verbal adjustment, which the Cabinet could safely leave to the Drafting Committee.The Secretary of State for Air thanked hiscolleagues for the efforts they had made to assist them, and the Prime Minister thanked the drafting committee for the spirit in which this difficult question had been settled.   He thought the cabinet could safely accept the draft, subject to the verbaladjustment referred to by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The Cabinet then discussed the procedure to beadopted with regard to the Statement, and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet thathe had learned from Geneva that there would be rather
a strong feeling if the British Statement was announced in Parliament without being announced in Geneva atth e s ame t ime .The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Declaration on Germany&apos;claim to Equality of Rights as set forth in 0.P.-377 (32), subject to theadoption of a new paragraph at the footof page 3, under sub-head &quot;(3) Air Arma-ments&quot;, as proposed by the drafting committee in CP.-385 (32).   The latterparagraph, however, was to incorporateminor verbal alterations to be concertedbetween the Drafting Committee and theSecretary of State for Air.(NOTE: Immediately after the Meetingof the Cabinet the drafting committee met the Secretaryof State for Air and agreedsome small amendments. the revised paragraph is attached as Appendix-1   to these Minutes .)(b) That the Declaration should be made atGeneva by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs next week at the firstconvenient opportunity .(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should arrange to publish the-   Declaration as a White Paper on thesame day as he makes it at Geneva.(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have authority, in his speech at the forthcoming Debate on disarmament, to indicate the general lines of the Statement, but without giving the details in the Annex.- this procedure would be similar to that adopted by M. Eerriot in connectionwith the French Plan.(e) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take appropriate actionto inform the Governments of the UnitedStates of America and. the other countriesprincipally concerned, that a Motion hadbeen put down by the Opposition on thesubject of Disarmament and. that theGovernment deemed it necessary, in thecourse of the Debate, to give some indi-cation of their policy on the Germanclaim to equality of treatment.(f) That, before making the Statement atGeneva, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take appropriate action to acquaint Mr Norman Davis,the United States representative atthe Disarmament Conference, very fully  .
as to its contents, and to take suchcorresponding action as he might deemadvisable with the principal French,Italian and Japanese Delegates andthe German Government.
MANCHURIA.The LyttonReport.(previous reference:Cabinet 87(31), Con-elusion 3.)3.   The Cabinet were reminded that the Motionput down by the Opposition in connection with theDisarmament Debate referred also to the attitude ofSis Majesty&apos;s Government on the Lytton Report onManchuria.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reminded the Cabinet that before the publication ofthe Report the Japanese Government had asked for an interval before its discussion at the League, in orderto prepare their comments.    The Chinese Delegate hadnot opposed the proposal.    Eventually November 14thhad been fixed as the date for consideration of theReport.    The Japanese commentary was not yet available,but he understood it was to be delivered next week.Consequently he proposed to say in the Debate that,pending the receipt of those comments, it Would not bepossible for him to make any observations on the LyttonReport.
3.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-380(32)) on the subject of Imperial Preference and mandated Territories, in response to a request bythe Cabinet, at the Meeting referred to in the margin, that he should enquire into the nature ofthe advice given in the past by the Law officers as to our right to give Imperial Preference toterritories under &quot;B&quot; Mandates, such as Tanganyika,and, if necessary, to consult the present Law Officers,The last Report of the Law Officers, which was dated september 21, 1921, was as follows:-&quot;We have taken the matter into our consideration and in obedience to your commands have the honour toreport that in our opinion there isno objection to the grant of prefer-ence in the United Kingdom to thegoods which are the produce of(a) territories to be administered under &quot;B&apos; Mandates, assuming thatthe provisions of the draft Mandatesremain substantially in their present form, or (b) territories administered under &apos;C&apos; Mandates,   Neither of these classes of territories can, in ouropinion, be regarded as  &quot;foreign,countries&apos;,No subsequent information had been sought from theLaw Officers regarding the grant of preference to*B1 and &apos;c&apos; Mandated Territories, but on a numberof occasions they had considered this question inrelation to Palestine,      In each case referencehad been made by the Law Officers to the aboveReport, and it had been pointed out that ifPalestine is a &quot;foreign country&quot; in the sense that- 5 -We have, &amp;c ,,(Signed)GORDON HEWARTERNEST M. POLLOCK.&quot;
it is not part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, sc? also inthat narrow sense are Protectorates and &apos;B&apos; mandated territories.Discussion took place as to whether, in view ofthe fact that the Opinion of the Law Officers was morethan ten years old, it wo\ild net be advisable to invitea new Opinion in the light of the latest developments.After a conspectus of all the circumstances, however,the Cabinet decided that it was unnecessary andinadvisable to obtain a fresh Opinion.       The Cabinet,therefore, contented themselves with taking note ofthe memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies (CP. 380(32)).
THE DYESTUFFS(IMPORT REGU-LATION)  ACT,19S0.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(30), Con-elusion 10)4,      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (CP.-370 (32))reporting as to the present position relating tothe Dyestuffs (import Regulation) Act, 1920, which came into operation on the 15th January, 1921, fora period of ten years and has twice been continuedunder the Expiring Laws Act.    The Act is now due to expire on the 31st December, 1932, and in all thecircumstances the President of the Board of Traderecommended that the Act should now be allowed tolapse on the 31st December.The President of the Board of Trade reportedthat the. Secretary of State for War had raisedcertain points of concern to the VJar Office relating,for example, to the danger of disclosure of particu-lars of processes and to the efficiency of theindustry in the production of explosives and so forthThese matters would take some time to investigate,and in these circumstances he suggested that the dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act 1920 should becontinued for one year longer under the expiring laws Continuance Act, and that in the meanwhile heshould set up an enquiry to look into the questions raised by the Secretary of State for War.The Cabinet approved the above proposal.The suggestion was made that the President ofthe Board of Trade should obtain an undertaking fromthe producers of dyestuffs to sell their products to the users at the same prices as their competitorswere charging on the Continent.     The President ofthe Board of Trade undertook to look Into thismatter.
The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the Dyestuffs (Import Regulation)Act 1920 should he renewed for oneyear longer under the Expiring laws continuance Act:(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should set up an enquiry to look into the questions affectingImperial Defence, raised by theSecretary of State for War.(c) That the President of the Board ofTrade should also look into a proposalfor obtaining an undertaking from the dyestuffs manufacturers to sell their products to users at the same price as their competitors on the Continent.
5.     The Cabinet had before them a Most secret draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation ofParliament (CP,-381 (32)), which had been preparedby the Committee appointed by the Cabinet at theMeeting mentioned in the margin, and circulated on instructions from the Prime Minister.The Cabinet were reminded that, before the prorogation Speech was delivered, the Prince of wales would have attended the opening of the new Parlia-mentary Buildings In Belfast.) T.o include mention of His Royal Highness 1 visit would tend to overloadthe Speech, to omit It would attract attention inview of the reference in the first paragraph of theDraft Speech to His Royal Highness1 visits to denmark and Sweden.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn also tothe paragraph relating to the Agricultural industry which referred to wheat, fruit growing and marketgardening, but included no mention of the importantnegotiations for a voluntary restriction of meatimports which had been undertaken since the passage in question was drafted.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the references in the King&apos;sSpeech to the visits of the prince of Wales to Denmark and Sweden shouldbe omitted, and that no mention shouldbe made of His Royal Highness&apos; forth-coming visit to Belfast:(b) That the Lord President of the council should refer to the Prince of Wales1visits in the Speech which he was to deliver when deputising for thePrime Minister at the GuildhallBanquet the same evening:

UNEMPLOYMENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(32), Con-conclusion 7.)Committee on trade and &apos;Industry.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(32), Oon-clusion 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Unemployment, which hadbeen under consideration at the Meeting referred toin the margin:-An Interim Report by the CabinetCommittee (CP.-307 (32)), theRecommendations and Conclusionsof which are attached as Appendix IIto Cabinet 58 (32):A Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP.-364 (32)) coveringsome observations by the Treasury,which have been reproduced as appendix III to Cabinet 58 (32).The Prime Minister proposed that most of the subjects referred to in the above Reports should beconsidered by the new organisation that was being set up to deal with Trade and Industry.   A discussion on this subject had taken place on the previous day and he had since discussed the matter with one or twothat it would be best of his colleagues,    In the result he had decided/toset up an organisation of an elastic character, whichwould include a nucleus of Ministers and a panel of experts,   Ministers would receive invitations to every meeting, but would not necessarily attendunless it was a matter in which they were concernedor interested.   The panel of experts would, give their services on specific points, but he proposed toarrange that one or two should attend all meetings,in order to keep in touch with the work as a whole.In the present pressure of work he had not been ableto find a Minister who could spare the time to takeentire charge of this work.    In the circumstances he proposed for the present to take charge of ithimself, to see the Secretary two or three times aweek in order to ensure that work was going on, andto take the Chair at the more important meetings,
Hous ingand slum clearance.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(52), Con-elusion 13h&quot;R.though not necessarily at all meetings.   He hoped to associate Sir Horace Wilson as permanent adviser,working in close touch with the Secretary, Mr H.D.without.hcw-ever. disturbing his present position.Henderson/.   One .of the first questions to be taken up, the Prime Minister added, was Housing and slum clearance, on which the Minister of Health was preparing a Memorandum.The Minister of labour, while not dissentingfrom the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal to refer theUnemployment Report to the new organisation, askedfor an immediate decision on the proposals in theReport for the co-ordination of voluntary organisa-tions and for the provision of tools and equipment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that he had discussed the matter with theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Health and approved this proposal.The Prime Minister said that that was an example of the way in which he hoped the new organisationw ould ope rat e .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Interim Report of theCabinet Committee on Unemployment(CP.-307 (32)) should be referredto the new organisation on Tradeand Industry:(b) That the sum of  10,000 for expenses of the organisation andco-ordination of voluntary efforts to deal with Unemployment shouldbe sanctioned, as well as a sum of 15,000 for the provision of tools and equipment.   The question of the organisations on which the money should be expended was left to theMinister of Labour to decide.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (C.P.-375 (32)) on thesubject of the New Forest and the construction ofthe electricity &quot;grid&quot; between Southampton andBournemouth.   This line forms part of the maintransmission system, of the South-West England scheme,and the question to be decided was what -was the most appropriate route, taking into consideration boththe preservation of amenities in the district as aand the cost.whole/    The route proposed by the Central electricity board would cross the extreme north-west corner ofthe area included in the Forest for a distance ofapproximately 2^ miles, much of which would be only just within the Forest boundaries,    Local authorities had been consulted, and an Inquiry held by an Officerof the Ministry of Transport, who reported in favourof the proposed route and agreed with the LocalAuthorities that a grid line along either of &quot;thealternative routes would interfere to a greater extent with the amenities of the countryside.   Onthe other hand, the Forestry Commission, the Court ofVerderers and Associations connected with the NewForest object to any line within the boundaries ofthe Forest,  in order to maintain the principle thatthe Forest should be preserved intact as a Nationalsanctuary.   The Minister of Transport asked theCabinet to decide where the balance of public interestlay, and whether or not the proposals of the central electricity Board should be acceded to.
After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the Minister of Transport should arrange to visit the Mew Forest and tomake a personal investigation on the spot.He should, if possible, associate withhimself one or two members of the Cabinet:(b) That the subject should be placed on theAgenda of the Cabinet at theirs^fogwAaapwa^fe-by meetings fa-t-kijlk LlZr(c) That the Minister of Transport, If he deemed necessary, should obtain an opinion from theLaw Officers of the Croxra. on the legal rightsof the Verderers to prevent the constructionof the &quot;grid&quot; . 1*1*5 A. 1U h\j 9ws*b .

APPENDIX I.AIR ARMAMENTS.There is no aspect of international disarmamentmore vitally urgent than the adoption without delay of the most effective measures to preserve the civilian population from the fearful horrors of bombardment fromthe air.    The Government of the United Kingdom havealready stated that they would be prepared to go to any length, in agreement with ether Powers, to achieve thisobjectcThe proposal that all bombing machines should be abolished has been made from several quarters, andit has been claimed that the world-wide adoption ofthis proposal would in itself guarantee the finalabolition of bombing.    This, however, is not the case,for machines not actually designed for bombing maynevertheless be adapted and used for that purpose.What would be involved, therefore, is the entireabolition, by international agreement, of military and naval machines and of bombing (apart from the use ofsuch machines as are necessary for pclice purposes inoutlying places), combined with an effective Inter-national contro-1 of civil aviation.     The difficulties to be surmounted In achieving, by international agree-ment, such a programme are evidently very great, but his Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to co-operate withthe other chief Air Powers in a thorough examinationinto the practicability of so extensive a scheme.
appendix ii.draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.my lords and members of the house of commons ,THE admission of the Kingdom of Iraq to membership of the League ofNations as a fully independent sovereign State marks the successful issue of thepolicy which My Government and their predecessors have consistently pursuedduring the last twelve years. &quot;&quot; *- At the Lausanne Conference held, in the summer the Governments concernedcollaborated with success in devising the conditions of a lasting settlement of thequestion of German reparations as an essential preliminary to the. economic recovery of the world.I am deeply gratified at the successful conclusion of the Economic Conferenceheld at Ottawa between representatives of the Governments of the different partsof My Empire, and I-trust that it will add strength to the ties between my peoples and stimulate imperial trade. I have given My assent to theMeasure necessary to give effect in the United Kingdom to the recommendationsof the Conference.I regret that certain questions which have arisen between the UnitedKingdom and the Irish Free State have not yet, despite the efforts made, beenfound capable of adjustment.In accordance with the Resolutions approved by both your Houses, my ministers have been investigating the many difficult questions involved in the revision of the Indian Constitution, and they have removed a serious barrier toprogress by issuing a Declaration on the subject of communal representation.members of the house of commons,I thank you for the provision you have made for the public servicemy lords and members of the house of commons,The measures taken to meet the crisis of last autumn and the readiness ofthe community to make all necessary sacrifices have succeeded in re-establishing a balance between income and expenditure in our national finances.Within the last few months operations on a scale never hitherto attemptedhave been carried through with complete success for the purpose of reducing thecharge to the public for the service of the National Debt.The adverse balance of trade which occasioned so much anxiety last year hasbeen checked by the passing of the Import Duties Act and a substantial additionto the Revenue has been obtained by the same means, while a reasonable protectionhas been afforded to British industry on the recommendations of an impartialadvisory committee.Since the passing of this Act approaches have been made to My Government,by the Governments of a number of foreign countries, with a view to the negotiation of trade agreements. My Ministers welcome these approaches andconversations have already begun which will, I trust, lead to mutually satisfactory arrangements.The condition of the agricultural industry has received the anxiousconsideration of My Ministers. The serious position in the live-stock industry has demanded emergency measures and a scheme for the voluntary regulation ofimports of meat into this country is now being brought into operation with theco-operation of the Governments and commercial interests in the Dominions andforeign countries concerned. I am gratified to learn that this co-operation hasbeen so readily forthcoming.november .18; 1932.(7850)
I have given My assent to a Measure for the assistance of growers of wheat in this country, and provision has been made for the protection and encouragement of the fruit growing and market gardening industries.An Act of great constitutional significance, namely, the Statute of westminster, 1931, which makes clear the powers of Dominion Parliaments^ hasbeen passed. This Act gives effect to certain resolutions passed by the imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930 setting out the relationship of the United Kingdomand the Dominions.I have given My assent to a Bill laying down the rules to. be observed withregard to certain matters in the assessment of transitional payments to theunemployed, and enabling the; same rules to be applied to outdoor relief.  . ,. &apos;; A Measure has been passed consolidating and amending the law of town planning, whereby the responsible authorities will in future be enabled, subjectto due consideration of all interests concerned, to study and deal with problems ofdevelopment in relation to areas, whether built up&apos; or not.A number of other Measures of public utility have been added to theStatute Book.On the advice of My Ministers I have appointed a Commission to enquire into the existing law and the practice thereunder relating to lotteries, betting,gambling and cognate matters, and to report what changes, if any, are desirable and practicable. . , . .In bidding you farewell, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours. ,
