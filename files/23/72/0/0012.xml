HE SECRETARY 1.   The Secretary of State for Air informedSTATE FORthe Cabinet that a scurrilous pamphlet had lately been published purporting to be under the auspices of the British Indian Empire Society.   He himself was a member of that Society ana his name appearedon the list of Vice-presidents on the back of thepamphlet.   He had written to Lord Sumner and LordSydenham, who had introduced him to the Society,asking that his name might be taken off the list.He felt bound, however, to mention the matter tohis colleagues owing to the nature of the pamphlet.The Cabinet were informed that as a matter of fact the pamphlet in question was repudiated by theBritish Indian Empire Society.A suggestion was made that it might be advisable for the Secretary of State for Air to send a shortletter to &quot;The Times&quot; on the subject, but it was felt that this might involve giving an undesirablepublicity to the pamphlet.The Prime Minister suggested that on thispoint the Secretary of State for Air should consult the Secretary of State for India.
984LICE PAY* 2, The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported theresults of discussions he had held earlier in theSpreviousReference: afternoon with the Home Secretary, the Secretary oflOabinet 51132), Con- State for Scotland and Officials of the two Depart-jjclusion 4.)^ ments, as well as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary,Home offiee*    The figure of  35,000 mentioned at theMeeting that morning, he reported, had been produced a portion of theas an aggregate compiled from^eplies to a circularsent out usually at this time of year to police authorities making enquiries as to their requirements for the next financial year and as to how the estimates for the current financial year were likely to work out.Only this morning were the Officials of the HomeOffice able to report on the results of about one on thesequarter of the returns.   They anticipated that/therewould be an additional net saving of  35,000 on thepresent year.    These figures had no relation to anyparticular pledge.   Earlier in the year a circularhad been issued asking for suggestions as to possiblesavings which could he considered in consultationwith fetee/Police Council, and that was the only faua*^  ^bl^cL   %i*ZjL(&apos; k lj.ll)   k Luak Sv^-ecircular sent ie^connection with the late HomeSecretary&apos;s pledges.Another point that had emerged from the discussions that afternoon was that there are two different years,namely% the financial year from April to March, anda Police pay year from October 1 to September 30.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained the complications due to the existence of these two&quot;years&quot; with their differing dates .   The late HomeSecretary&apos;s pledges always referred to the second year of the Police cuts .   For the second year thePosition was as follows:-
Savings if the whole cutwere imposed . ...  1,400.000Savings on Pay of new entrants ... 106,000AdministrativeSavings ... 454,000Total      ...  1.940.000that is to say, a shortage of 60,000 on the  2,000,000 &amp;^.Scou tfk^yIn addition,  it was necessary to include the further payments due to the fact that the cuts were to &quot;be imposed on November 1 instead of October 1.   Owingto this postponement the Police were  60,000 betteroff.   The total shortage, therefore, was  120,000on the  2,000,000 economy to be made by the HomeOffice.   Consequently, in imposing the 5% cut theywould be carrying out the pledge in the letter andin the spirit.Reverting to the  35,000 additional savings,the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the HomeOffice claimed that it was a reasonable assumptionthat it might be realised, but they could not give any guarantee.   Serious trouble in some of the towns,for example, might prevent it being realised.    Ifthe rate was maintained throughout the whole of thePolice Forces then there might be a total saving of 150,000.   Deducting from this the deficit of 120,COO referred to above, there would be a totalsurplus of  30,000.   The Home Secretary might beasked to return to the Police any balance over and above the  2,000,000 that might accrue.   At firsthis impression had been that to accede to such ademand might offer a way out of the difficulty, but since his meeting he had been considering the effecton other Departments .   The Chancellor of the Exchequer
suggested that the following course might be adopted:-To point out that the savings were estimates only,which might or might not be realised.    It was known that without such savings there would be a shortageof  120,000 on the  2,000,000 cut.   The Governmentwere entitled to ask the Police to pay back theadvantage they had gained owing to the postponement of the operation of the cuts until November 1.   an offer might be made, however, to set off these savingsagainst any possible balance over and above the 2,000,000 economies that the Home Office had to find.The effect of this would be that the Police would get the whole benefit of the postponement of theoperation of the cut from October to November.In reply to questions the Chancellor of theExchequer explained that the figures stated above were different from those he had given at t^e morningMeeting, but they were figures agreed between the officials of the Home Office and the Treasury.   At the morning Meeting he had not taken into account the 60,000 due to the postponement of the operation ofthe cut from October I&apos; to November 1.The Secretary of State for Scotland reminded theCabinet that the late Home Secretary and Secretary ofState for Scotland had held out hopes that the police would benefit to a considerable extent if they couldeffect savings.   The Police... had in fact helped to effect the savings, and Police Committees had been set up in Various places for this purpose. &apos; Now the reply was to be made that in spite of this the fullcut was to be imposed.   Would it not be an advantage,he asked, to hand back the amount of savings that hadbeen made?
The Prime Minister pointed out that the reasonwas that the economies were not sufficient.    It wasalso pointed out that every Government Department,in different degrees, had had to, effect - economies,but that these were not put to the benefit of thepersonne.1 they controlled.Enquiry was made as to the views of tte&amp;&apos;  jsisfifiCommissioner of Police in London, and the cabinet were informed that he himself did not think theimposition of the full cut was a hardship, but hehad no doubt that it would be regarded as such bythe Police, One result would be that, in the eventof any trouble, the Government would only have anunsympathetic body of men to rely on.It was suggested that if the real is ed cutsproved to be larger than  60,000, -rather,a difficult situation would arise.The Prime Minister then put a series of proposi-tions to the Cabinet, each of which was discussed in turn, and the Cabinet agreedThat in discussions with the police council the Home Secretary and secretary of State for scotland should base themselves on thefollowing lines(a) That the original figure of 8,000,000 fixed as the savings to be realised by the Home office would be adhered to:(b) That it had come to the noticeof the Cabinet that certainpromises had been made by thelate Home Secretary and Secretaryof State for Scotland;    thatthose promises had been carriedout?    but that investigationshowed that the realised economiesdid not enable the Government to vary the original cuts of 5%:(e) That, nevertheless, the police would be allowed to retain theadvantage they had derived fromthe postponement of the operation
of the second cut from October 1stto November 1st:(d) That their attitude to the police council should be one of candour;that the financial troubles of thelast twelve months should be explained to them;   and that theMinisters should be authorised togive a strong hint that the country has not yet emerged from its financial difficulties :(e) That the Ministers should beauthorised to make clear that therewas as yet no final Cabinet decision,but that they themselves had been considering the subject and that theirviews were as set forth above.   Theyshould be authorised,  if they thought fit, to say that they would reportthe views of the Police Council tothe Cabinet.
THE ottawa conference.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(32), Con-clusion 2.)-r3.  The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Ottawa Conference:-A Most Secret draft Ottawa Agree-ments Bill and Notes on Clauses,.with a covering Note by the Secretary(CP.-335 (32)) drawing attention tocertain Clauses on which a cabinet decision is required, viz., Clause 2(2)  (Relations with the Irish FreeState), and Clause 13 (3)  (Duration),together with relevant Notes .A Note by the President of the Boardof Trade (CP.-339 (32)), originallyprepared for the Ottawa legislation committee, circulated in connectionwith Clause 2 (2) of the draft ottawa agreements Bill (Relations with theIrish Free State) ,A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-336 (32)), aspromised by him at the Meeting ofthe Cabinet referred to in the margin,explaining the connection between the ottawa Agreements and the WorldFinancial and Economic Conference.andthe two following Memoranda on the question of MeatImports, which had been on the Agenda Paper of theCabinet at an earlier Meeting:-A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (C.P.-295 (32)) examiningvarious suggestions for overcoming thedifficulty, due to existing international obligations, in carrying out the &quot;agreed programme&quot; for the limitation of importsof frozen mutton and. lamb and frozen andchilled beef into the United Kingdom   &apos;\,from foreign countries, which formsA partof the Agreements made at Ottawa withthe Australian and New Zealand Govern-ments .    It was explained that this difficulty arises from the existenceof the International Convention forthe Abolition of Import and ExportProhibitions, which was also designedto keep within narrow limits this methodof regulating imports as between theparties;    coupled with the fact thatcertain other countries are entitledto most-favoured-nation treatment inthe matter.   The method which thePresident of the Board of Trade was inclined to recommend was that forthe present we should make use ofthe following Clause in the Inter-national Conventiont-
&quot;Nothing in this Convention shallaffect the right of any highcontracting party to adopt measuresprohibiting or restrictingimportation or exportation forthe purpose of protecting inextraordinary and abnormalcircumstances the vital interestsof the country&quot; ,The President admitted, however, thatthe difficulty of maintaining thisview consistently for a period ofyears was such that we should probably have to consider withdrawing from theInternational Convention on or before june SO, 1933.A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP.-316 (38))suggesting that it was almost impossibleto contend that the limitation agreedupon with reluctance by the UnitedKingdom for the benefit of Australiaand New Zealand is a measure taken for the purpose of protecting the&quot;vital interests&quot; of the UnitedKingdom.   The contention would be too palpably disingenuous.   TheSecretary of State, in his Memorandum,reached the conclusion that it wouldbe unwise to adopt the course recom-mended by the President of the Boardof Trade, but undertook to considera more complicated course mentioned by the President before expressinga definite opinion on it.In addition to the above, the Cabinet had beforethem -A Joint Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Trade(CP.-342 (32)) stating that they hadjointly considered further the proposal in CP.-295 to invoke the Clause inthe International Convention, quoted above, to which objection was raised in CP.-316 (32).    In view of the factthat the United States of America aloneof all countries signatory of theInternational Convention would beaffected, and as the United Statesof America is at present unable totake Great Britain before any arbitral tribunal on the question, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Traderecommended to their colleagues thatthe proposal made in CP.-295 (32),and set forth above, should be accepted,on the understanding that this country should denounce the Imports and ExportsProhibitions Convention at the earliestpossible date, viz., July 1, 1933.
After a short disctission the Cabinet agreed.  (a) That the Cabinet Committee should meet on Thursday, October 13th, inthe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;-room at the Treasury, at 2.30 p.m.,for a final examination of the Bill,since some amendments had been introduced subsequent to the last meeting of the Committee:(b) To take note that, from, the point ofview of the time-table of government business, which contemplates proroga-tion on the 17th or 18th november and the opening of a new Sessionof Parliament on the 22nd November,it is important that, if possible,the Ottawa Agreements Bill should leave the House of Commons not later than November 8th:(c) That   since the proposals in thePresident of the Board of Trade&apos;sMemorandum C,P,-339 (.32)  (Relationswith the Irish Free State), would only come into the range of practical politics in the event of a succesful issue of the Irish negotiations,their discussion shoiild be postponed.:(d) That as the Meat Companies had setup a Committee of their own toconsider the working out of those parts of the Ottawa Agreements thataffected their industry and were toreport to the President of the Boardof Trade next week, consideration ofthe Memoranda dealing with these subjects should be postponed.The Secretary was instructed to keep them on the Agenda Paper of theCabinet; viz.,C .P.-295 (32)C.P.-316 (32) and G.P.-342 (32).
292Kkr ZJ  rOtrade WITH 4. The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumRUSSIA,by the President of the Board of Trade (C,P,-337 (32))(Previous on the subject of the Anglo-Soviet Commercial Agree-Reference:Cabinet 48 ment, stating that the results of the Ottawa Confer-(32), Con-clusion 8.) ence made it necessary to consider the questionf\R. immediately, and making the following suggestions:-a^6. (i) That the present Agreement should be*^7denounced:(ii) That, at the same time, we should offer to enter into negotiationswith the Soviet Government as tothe situation thus arising:(iii) That we may rely on the Russiansasking for a fresh Agreement, andin that case we should explore allpossibilities of securing some improvement in our balance of accounts with them:(iv) That, failing any wider arrangement,we can fall back on the modus vivendisuggested by the Foreign Office.Attached to the Memorandum was a Note by. the ForeignOffice on the negotiation of a new Anglo-SovietAgreement, and statistics of United Kingdom exportsto Russia and of Russian imports into the UnitedKingdom,The Cabinet were reminded that for many morthspast the Department of Overseas Trade and the export credits Guarantee Department had been pressing thatthe present Russian Trade Agreement should be broughtto an end, with a vie\v to eliminating the most-favoured-nation clauses, which conferred great advantages on russia from the point of view of the balance of trade:also that a Cabinet Committee in C.P*-169 (32) had recommended the denunciation of the Trade Agreementlast May; that from the point of view of the ottawa Agreements it was essential that the trade agreement should be denounced, and that the repre-sentatives of the Dominions had been so informed at ottawa.
The Prime Minister, who did not conceal hissuspicions of Bolshevist activities, particularlyin the political sphere, nevertheless felt somereluctance in denouncing the Agreement in thepresent very serious economic condition of thecountry.   He was apprehensive lest there should be large discharges o^ men during the forthcomingwinter, when unemployment was so bad.   He was onlyable to agree to the denunciation of the russian trade Agreement on the ground that he was given tounderstand it was essential from the point of viewof the Ottawa Agreements, by which he intended to stand.After examining in detail the four points inthe President of the Board of Trade&apos;s memorandum cp.-337 (32), which are set forth at the head ofthis Minute, the Cabinet agreed - (a) That the present Russian trade agreement should be denounced;&apos;   (b) That at the same time we should offer to enter into negotiationswith the Soviet Government as tothe situation thus arising.

THE Committee had before them a Note by theSecretary covering lists of Bills proposed for the parliamentary session 1932-33 (Paper H.A. 30 (32)).The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury informed theCommittee that it was proposed to devote the remainder of thepresent Session mainly to the enactment of the Ottawa AgreementsBill and the passage of a motion to carry over the london passenger Transport Bill to the next Session of Parliament;and, if it were considered advisable, to pass the Expiring laws continuance Bill and the Visiting Forces (British Common-wealth) Bill. It was proposed to begin the new Session aboutthe end of November.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Laboursaid that in certain events it might be necessary to ask parliament to enact a short Ministry of Labour Bill before the23resent Session was prorogued.The Lord: Chancellor observed that in addition to the Billsmentioned above, he hoped that it might be possible to pass into law during the remainder of the present Session the Administra-tion of Justice Bill (Paper H.A. 31 (32)), which it was proposedto introduce in the House of Lords, as well as the visiting forces (British Commonwealth) Bill.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury informed theCommittee that while no decision had yet been taken on thetime-table for the 1932-33 Session, it appeared to him, on theinformation available, that in addition to the usual Compulsoryor Annual Bills time would have to be found in the new Sessionfor Bills of major importance dealing with the following subjects :-London Passenger Transport,Rent Restriction,Government of India,Unemployment Insurance,Recommendations of the Road-Rail Conference,and, in addition Legislation arising out - of the World EconomicConference, Ireland, and the Pig Re-organisationrecommendations, together with any economy measureswhich might be found necessary.
Some of these Bills, as for example, the Rent RestrictionBill, would have to be taken on the floor &quot;of the House, and  hiswould further reduce the time available for other legislation.In these circumstances, he wished to impress upon the Committeethat there would be very little time available for Bills other thanthose to which he had referred, and he hoped that ministers concerned would, so far as practicable, refrain from introducing&quot;Bills which would have little or no prospect of passing into law,and the preparation of which imposed additional heavy burdens on Parliamentary Counsel.The Committee agreed (a) to adopt the following classification in submitting to theCabinet their recommendations regarding therelative urgency of the Bills enumerated in paper.A. 30 (32) on the understanding that it will befor the Cabinet to determine the order of priorityand relative importance of the Bills: (A)-Bills already before Parliament.(B) ilJsual Annual or Compulsory Bills.(C) Urgent  and  Essential  Bills  (other  thanthose named in List &quot; B &quot;) : (i) Bills  with  which   the   Cabinet  havedecided to proceed,(ii) Bills, the early introduction of whichhas been announced.(iii) Bills which must become law by certaindates.(iv) Other Essential Bills.(D) Useful Bills, mainly Non-Controversial.(E) Other Bills not yet ready, or which may berequired in certain events.(F) Consolidation Bills.(b) To recommend the Cabinet to approve the classification of the Bills as set out in the Annex to these Conclu-sions, on the understanding that the insertion of bills in the list is without prejudice to their ultimateclassification.(c) To take note that it is proposed to proceed with thefollowing Bills during the remainder of the present session : In the House of Commons The Ottawa Agreements Bill.Motion to carry over the London Passenger&apos;Transport Bill.The Ministry of Labour Bill.   (If required.)And, possibly, the Expiring Laws Continu-ance Bill.the House of Lords The   Visiting   Forces   (British   Common-wealth) Bill.The Administration of Justice Bill.Grown Pro- 2. - In reply to questions by the Law Officers, the Lordceedings Bill. Chancellor said that he intended at an early date to bring beforeArbitration Bill, the Home Affairs Committee two legal measures the CrownProceedings Bill and the Arbitration Bill. The only reason forwhich he had not included these measures in the provisional listof Bills now under discussion was that his discussions with theauthorities concerned were not vet concluded.[7691]
