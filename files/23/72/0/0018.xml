O U J..KALTA.e Languageuestion.previous reference:Cabinet 55(32), Con-elusion 9.) ft,2, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP .-372(32)) stating that on Friday last, October 28th,the situation in Malta came suddenly to a headwhen he received a telegram from the Governorstating that he understood that Ministers were about to ask him to recommend an appropriation from public funds to meet the cost of the so-called&quot;voluntary&quot; Italian classes.   Accordingly, afterconsultation with the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he sent theGovernor a telegram instructing him to informMinisters that he was advised that the proposal topay out of public funds for the voluntary classesis a breach of the Constitution Letters-Patent andis illegal and therefore it was not possible for himto recommend or to allow any appropriation ofpublic funds for the purpose.    In view of theinternational position he was asked, if possible,to avoid a public breach with Ministers at themoment.    Copies of telegrams interchanged with theGovernor were attached.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat, according to the latest information, theMinisters at Malta appeared to be holding their hands for a few days and there was just a possibility that they might climb down, although this was ratherremote.The Cabinet took note of the above.
9 ft 9d yBBDUOTION ANDRATION of armaments .(previous reference:Cabinet 57(32), Con-clusion 1.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Attan-oreported that the Drafting Committee of the cabinet had met for several hours on the previous evening and had made good progress on the political side ofthe Government&apos;s policy.    As yet, however, they hadnot had time to discuss the detailed questions of disarmament affecting the Defence Services.   Conse-quently he could not hold out any hope of their being able to circulate a Report to the Cabinet much beforethe end of the week at best.   He himself was not proposing to proceed to Geneva at the moment, and theParliamentary Under-Secretary would represent himthere.   M. Paul Boneour was to deliver a speech atthe Bureau on the French Plan, but he gathered thatthe Plan as a whole might not be laid just yet.   Hehad heard that Mr Norman Davis was advising the Frenchnot to produce it.   M. Herriot would not be visitingGeneva before the following week.   He hoped that thePrime Minister might possibly be able to visit Genevahimself when the Government&apos;s policy was settled.The Prime Minister felt some doubts as to whether,or when, he could attend the Disarmament Conference.If he went to Geneva he did not wish merely to makea speech and then to return.   To do any .good it wasnecessary to follow up any statement that was made.But he would have to be in London some days beforethe opening of the new Parliament on November 22nd.A suggestion was made that it would be a great advantage if the United Kingdom had a Delegate who could stay permanently at Geneva, who was not a minister.    Several other Powers had permanent repre-sentatives, of Ambassadorial rank, and this, it wassuggested, would be a great convenience.
The Prime Minister summed up the discussion by stating that the Cabinet Drafting Committee must begiven as much time as it required to complete itsReport, and that the Cabinet must also have at least a clear 24 hours, and, if possible, longer, toconsider it.   When the Report was received he would  .consider whether it should be discussed at the regular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet next Wednesday or ifhe afcseuld summon a Meeting at an earlier date.
4. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Anglo-Persian relations:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (O.P.-358 (32)), prepared, in accordancewith the request of the Cabinet attheir Meeting on October 19th(Cabinet 53 (32), Conclusion 2),with particular reference to the islands of Henjam and Bahrein, which constitutes the two outstanding diffi-culties in the way of the conclusionof a general Treaty settlement to regularise Anglo-Persian relations.At the end of the Memorandum theviews of the Foreign Office were summarised in terms which are reproduced in Appendix. I (A) .A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (C .P.-371 (32)),dealing with (I) Bahrein, and(II) The General Negotiations with Persia, the conclusions of whichare summarised in Appendix I (B).The discussion ranged over practically the w^holeof the ground covered by the two Memoranda referredto above.    The proposal to offer or acquiesce in aninternational arbitration over the Persian claim toBahrein Island did not commend itself to the Cabinet.A point on which some stress was laid was that theGovernment of the United Kingdom could not be forcedto arbitrate on the subject of Bahrein under the optional Clause.   Persia could raise the question ofBahrein at the Council of the League under Article XIof the Covenant, but it would be impossible for her to compel us to go to arbitration if we objected, asunanimity on the Council is necessary.    In thesecircumstances it was suggested that it was unnecessary to refer the question to the Law Officers for an opinion.   Great stress was also laid on the importanceof Henjam from the Naval point of view, and of Bahreinif Henjam should have to be evacuated.   The vitalimportance of Bahrein in connection with the develop-Air
A new point which was raised in the discussion was that some use might be made in the discussions at Tehran of the probable eventual constructionof the Haifa-Baghdad Railway.    Owing to theconstruction of the pipeline and the financialadvantages that Iraq was likely to obtain from thedevelopment of her oil supplies, the construction,of this railway was gradually coming into the range of possibilities.   The possible extension of thatrailway into Persia, to link up with the Trans-Persian railway scheme, must obviously be of greatimportance to Persia, and was reported to be amatter in which the Shah was personally interested.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That we should adopt a firm line ofpolicy towards Persia and should notevacuate Henjam or surrender ourposition in any way with seemingacquiescence.   We should not regard the possibility of Persia raising the question of Bahrein at the Councilof the League as a factor in the determination of our policy.    Ifsuch action on their part should become probable, the Secretary ofState should cons tilt the Cabinet:(b) That while, in the last resort, itwould not be possible to refuse to evacuate Henjam Island, which wasPersian territory, nevertheless theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should take tip a firm attitude in response to the Persian demand.He should makeiit clear to the PersianGovernment that as, in consequence ofthe evacuation, we should have to spenda good deal of money on the provisionof facilities elsewhere, we should haveto insist on the repayment of thePersian War Debt before the evacuationtook place.   Any other bargainingassets that we might possess shouldbe made use of in these discussions,including, so far as might be found possible, the Halfa-B.agh.dad Railwayproj ect.
30IMPORTDUTIESf^oposedpreferencet0 Palestine(previous reference:Cabinet 50(33), Con-conclusion 8.)5. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the proposed grant of Prefer-ence to Palestine:-- A Memorandum by the Foreign Office(CP.-363 (32)) giving the resultsof communications with variousforeign Governments on the subject,and showing that the maj ority ofthe Governments who were consultedhave stated that if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment accord Imperial Prefer-ence to Palestine they will consider themselves en itled to claim similar treatment to their goods under themost-favoured-nation clauses oftheir Commercial Treaties with theUnited Kingdom.   The Foreign Officefurther showed that if a case were -taken to the Hague Court His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be likely to lose it:that if the United States were theGovernment with which it was decidedto litigate at The Hague they would insist on the question of the otherMandated Territories being submittedat the same time:    and that a refer-ence of the Palestine question toThe Hague would almost certainlyencourage foreign countries, andnotably the United States of America,to challenge the&apos; whole principle ofImperial Preference to the Dominions:A Report by a Cabinet Committee(CP,-367 (32)) stating that, inview of the considerations set out xin CP ,-363 (32) the Committee had reluctantly reached the conclusionthat the proposal to extend imperial preference to Palestine must be abandoned.   At the same time theCommittee hoped that in any subsequent negotiations for commercial treaties with foreign countriesefforts would be made to secure somePreference to the products of Palestine.The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised thequestion as to whether we were quite sure of ourposition in the event of the United States Governmentfollowing up the view they have advanced in thePalestine correspondence that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare not entitled to grant preference to mandated territories other than Palestine, and more particularlyterritories like Tanganyika, under a &quot;B&quot; Mandate.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To adopt the view of the CabinetCommittee that the proposal toextend Imperial Preference to palestine must be abandoned:(b) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should enquire intothe nature of the advice given inthe past by the Law Officers as toour right to give Imperial Prefer-ence to territories under a WB&quot;Mandate, such as Tanganyika, and.should if necessary        consult the present law Officers.-8-
oGMEAT POLICY, 6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by(p the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP,-568(previous reference:        (32)), prepared in accordance with the decision ofCabinet 55(32), Con- the Cabinet mentioned in the margin, on the subjectelusion 8 ( c) ..)of Meat Policy,   The conclusions are set forth atthe end of the Memorandum as follows:-(l) A reasonable proportion for thehome producer in the meat marketmight be regarded as 50/50, to bereached after a period of years,(2) This, however, is hypothetical,since the meat market is showingsigns of collapse and beef prices have fallen by 33 per cent, in five months ,(.3) Some regulation of supplies beyondthe Ottawa arrangements, &apos; both intime and quantity, can scarcely bebe avoided.    This regulation wouldrequire to include Irish supplies .(.4) The regulation would be, for thepresent, of an emergency character,extending only until the situation could be reviewed by the MeatConference in, say, April.(5) mhe regulation should be, as faras possible, by voluntary arrange-ments, but the possible necessityfor reserve powers, involvinglegislation, should not be over-looked.(6) Australian contractors should beinvited to accept a two months&apos; gap in their deliveries to the Forces,the gap to be filled by home supplies.(7) A Meat Commission for the problem ofthe home producer should be appointedforthwith.    Its interim report wouldbe available for the Meat Conference,(8) The Meat Conference would include representatives from all suppliersof our markets , foreign as well ashome and Dominion.In the course of a somewhat prolonged discussion the suggestion was made that the President of theBoard of Trade, the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland,should call together the leaders of the meat importtrade (both Imperial and foreign).   The object would
be to put to these representatives the very serious positionto home agriculture and, indeed, to all concerned, resultingfrom the glut not only of mutton and lamb (as was the case before the Ottawa Conference), but now also of beef and bacon,and the catastrophic effect of the great consequential fallIn prices.     It was suggested that the Ministers should try and secure a voluntary scheme of restriction of imports fromabroad.      In addition, it was urged that home agriculture would have to make Its contribution to any such scheme of restriction.Ihe President of the Board of Trade pointed out that thepresent glut in meat supplies was due not to imports from foreign countries but to over production in the Dominions.The prospects of trade negotiations with Argentina and Denmarkwere promising, but the worst way to begin them would be by aserious diminution of their most important Imports.The discussion revealed that the question,  though of immediate urgency, was also very complicated and required closerinvestigation, than was possible by the Cabinet as a whole.The Cabinet agreed : -(a) That the question was one of great urgency and must be settled as soon as.possible:(b) That it should be remitted to the following ministers, who would meet the same afternoon,at 4 p.m. In the Prime Minister&apos;s Room atthe House of Commons: -The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Foreign Secretary to be available If required.(NOTE;      The Prime Minister undertook to represent the
Secretary of State for War in connectionwith a proposal for the purchase of home-grown meat for part of the requirements ofthe Army, as he was already familiar withthe main lines of the question.     TheSecretary of State for War undertook tosend him some notes on the subject.)
UNEMPLOYMENT(previous reference:Cabinet 35(32), Con-clusion 6.)FA.reference cabinet 53(32), Con-conclusion 4.(The means test).7 , The&quot; Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Unemployment:-An Interim Report of a Committee ofParliamentary Under-Secretaries setup by the Prime Minister on September29th, 1932 (CP.-307 (32)), dealingwith Unemployment. The Recommenda-tions and Conclusions of the Committeeare attached in appendix ii to these minutes.A Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP.-364 (32)) coveringsome observations by the Treasury(Appendix ^1.1) .Time did not permit of a detailed discussion ofthe above Reports.    The question was raised as towhether a decision was not urgent, in view of theforthcoming Debates on Unemployment in the House ofCommons.    It was pointed out, however, that theobject of these Debates was not to provide an occasion for announcing Government policy, but rather a freediscussion over the whole subject, to obtain suggestions and indicate the ground that had to be covered.   Itwas urged that a decision ought to be taken at anearly date on these Reports, both in order that theymight come into operation during the present winter and in order to co-ordinate the valuable voluntaryefforts that were being made all over the country toassist the unemployed and to forestall &quot;  -     &quot;private proposals for such co-ordination.The Cabinet were reminded that larger proposals were under consideration by the Kingfs SpeechCommittee, and it was suggested that it would be un-desirable to take decisions now on the Interim Reportsbefore the Cabinet until their bearing on the largerpolicy had been considered.The Cabinet agreed  That the above documents should remain on the Agenda Paper of theCabinet and should be discussed assoon as possible.

It was represented at Ottawa that thesupplies of Empire copper were adequate to take care of. the United Kingdom requirements.   Investigationhas shown that this is not the ease, and that sometime must elapse before the full demands can be met.The position has been explored at conferences held atthe Board of Trade between representatives of the producers and the consumers.

The Cabinet took note of Weekly Reports byLocal Governments on the Political Situation inIndia,  circulated for information by the Secretaryof State for India (C.P.-366 (32)).2, Whitehall Gardens, S .W.1,November 2, 1932.
APPENDIX   l.A.(Reference CP. 371(32).(a) It is still desirable, on general grounds of policy, to endeavour to secure a satis-factory treaty settlement with Persia, ifthis is at all possible.(b) The chief difficulty in the way of such asettlement is that the two main points forsolution are (1) the abandonment by Persiaof her claim to Bahrein, and (2) the grantby the Persian Government to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of facilities for His Majesty&apos;s ships at Nenjam.     Both these are rightly orwrongly regarded by the Persians as con-cessions on their side.     The concessionshitherto offered by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin exchange are considered insufficient by the persians, and their value is in fact to someextent illusory.(c) It seems, therefore, impossible to obtain asolution of both Bahrein and Henjam which wouldbe entirely satisfactory to us, unless we areprepared to offer Persia fresh concessions of substantial value.     Such further concessionswould be difficult to find, especially as thepayment of any considerable financial quid proquo would, in present circumstances, be difficultto justify to public opinion in this country.(d) Although, however, the negotiations are unlikely to yield a satisfactory solution of both Bahreinand Henjam, neither of these questions will be satisfactorily solved if the negotiations come toan end,-    Unless some special arrangement   isreached with the Persian Government, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will probably be forced both to evacuateHenjam and to arbitrate Bahrein.(e) It is now necessary to face the fact that some kind of arbitration regarding Bahrein may be in-inevitable.     It should, however, be possible forHie Majesty&apos;s Government to insist that such ar-bitration should take the form of a judicialdecision by the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice on the legal issues involved, and it mightwell be easier for the Shah to yield to an inter-national tribunal&apos;s finding than to a refusal ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, to admit his claim.     Itwould seem wise to obtain a preliminary opinionfrom the Law Officers on these legal issues withoutdelay, in order that His Majesty&apos;s Government mayhave all possible information regarding thestrength of their case.(f) If the case proves to be as Strong as has beenhitherto believed, then His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, take full advantage of the fact, and should be preparedto agree to a reference to the Permanent Court,(g) His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran should beauthorised to endeavour to obtain a satisfactory solution of the Henjam issue in return for anagreement to refer the Bahrein issue to thePermanent Court..
So far as Bahrein was concerned, the Secretaryof state conclusions are set forth in thefollowing paragraph:-10. I may sum up the position aboutBahrein very briefly.     The Persianclaim, so far as can be judged, is nota good one, but even if it were it isnot one which we can afford to acquiesce in.     The element of uncertainty as tothe future of the present regime in persia makes it particularly desirableto avoid any positive commitment.     Theretention of Bahrein is vital to our air communications with India;    to ourposition in the Gulf, and ao to ourposition in the Middle East.     Theimportance of our Gulf position is greater, on the findings of theCommittee of Imperial Defence aorecently as 1928, than it was evenin the years before the war, and its importance has been still further increased since the date of thosefindings by the fact that the Gulfhas in the meanwhile become the mainairway to the East.      The loes ofBahrein, or a compromise which would affect our position in Bahrein, would cut our air communications, would leave us without a possible navalstation (in the event Of our having to evacuate Heniam), and would havethe most calamitous effect on ourrelations with all the other Arabrulers of the Arab littoral of theGulf.     The confidence of those rulershas already to some extent been shakenAPPENDIX. I.B.(Reference CP. 571 ( 32) * )
by our inability to implement ourengagements to the Sheikh of Mohammerah.It is not, indeed, going too far tosay that the retention of our positionin the Gulf generally stands or fallsby the retention of the status quoin Bahrein.   The risks involved in international examination of thequestion are substantial, and havingregard to all these cireumstances I,like the Government of India, seethe strongest objection, which I trust my colleagues will share, to either volunteering or acquiescing in any suggestion of judicial settle-ment or judicial investigation of it.So far as the question as a whole is con-cerned, the Secretary of State&apos;s conclu-sions are set forth in Section III ofhis Memorandum as follows:-(a) As regards Bahrein, that my colleagues should endorse the general conclusionsset out in paragraph 10 above.    Ifthis view is accepted, there will beno particular advantage in troublingthe Law Officers to record an opinion.In any event, we must, I think, take our stand on the limited point ofundisturbed occupation since 1783 andresist any claim based on the factthat, while Persia has exercised no effective control in Bahrein sincethe islands were conquered by theancestors of the present Sheikh in1783, she has exercised control ofthe island at various earlier periodssince fand before) the beginning ofthe Christian era.(b) If the Persians withdraw their demandfor,the evacuation of Henjam,    that weshould make it clear to them that while we are anxious and ready to conclude ageneral treaty settlement with them,and while we have already made con-cessions of substantial importance as the first stages of such a settle-ment, no further coneess ion can beexpected from us, but that we areprepared to make a treaty settlement on the terms already indicated tothem, viz., the reopening of theDuzdap Railway;    the abandonment ofour claim to Sirri;    the evacuation of Basidu;    the removal of the Residencythe payment of rent for Henjam, and, ifnecessary, the joint use of Henjam bythe Persian Wavy;    the modificationof the Slavery Convention;    the transferof certain wireless stations;    theabandonment of  1,000,000 of the war debt (the outstanding balance   510,000   of which we are also prepared to abandon);    and finally,the definite assurance to Persia ofBritish goodwill and British support
in so far as this is practicable.If the Persians are not preparedto accept these terms, I would favour the adjournment, if possible.sine die of the discussions in whatever manner is regarded as most suitable,   All we want in theGulf is the general maintenance ofthe status quo (in particular, atHenjam);    and if we can secure this,a formal treaty is of only moderateimportance to us,(c) If Persia insists on the evacuation of Eenjam, that we should acquiesce in her demand (since we have neverquestioned her sovereignty), butthat we should claim a minimum,period of two years during which to provide alternative accommodation,and that we should equally make itclear that while we had acquiesced in her demand, the changed attitude which it represents and its incon-sistency with the line hithertofollowed is such that the treaty negotiations must be regarded asat an end,16. I think it most important that in either of the alternatives discussed in (b) and (c) we should retain theinitiative in bringing negotiations to an end, and should not leave itto Persia to dismiss us on the groundthat what we offer as the price of herfriendship is insufficient.   Finally, Ithink the course of the negotiationsshows that a policy of conciliation and compromise has cost us much andgained, us nothing.   Events so farleave me with no confidence in Persianbona fides (nor do I blame them fortrying to secure all they can at ourexpense) ,    I wrould now adopt a strongerline.    It cannot be more costly, andI am not without hope that it may bringthe Persians to see reason.
APPENDIX   II.UNEMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE.INTERIM REPORT - C.P.  307 (32).SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.23,     Recommendations.The Committee submit to the Cabinet the followinginterim recommendations and conclusions.-(a) That assistance be given by Government grant to the movement, for providing the unemployedwith opportunities of useful occupation and re-creation.     In particular, we make proposals relating to the construction of recreation grounds, playing field, etc. and the formationof physical training classes.     Voluntary or-organisations are already at work on these lines,and the grants which we suggest are intended toassist them in extending their activities.     we contemplate grants only in respect of expensesof organisation, cost of tools and equipment,etc. and we recommend that these should so far aspossible reach the organisations concernedthrough the National Council of Social Service,or other suitable bodies.     We suggest also, agrant to meet the expenses incurred by the Councilitself in stimulating local effort.Men and women participating in assisted schemes would receive no cash payments in addition tothe Unemployment Insurance benefits etc, to whichthey are at present entitled.(b) That the experimental physical training centres of the Ministry of Labour (the authority forwhich expires in December 1932) should continue for the present as demonstration centres.(c) That the Ministry of Labour and the Board ofEducation should encourage the provision ofspecial classes for the unemployed, and facilitiesfor their attendance at existing classes..(d) That it is desirable to develop and extend tothe utmost the Allotments Scheme, and that tothis end the Society of Friends be informed ofthe amount of grant in respect of their Allot-ments Scheme which will be forthcoming in future years; and that, in order to make the schemeeffective. Local Authorities be encouraged toacquire land for use as allotments, where itappears that no loss will be involved.     If incertain large industrial areas where allotmentsare most needed, land cannot be so acquired, theGovernment should consider the grant of financialassistance to the Local Authority,(e) That immediate consideration be given to theestablishment of a Ministry of Labour Centre onthe Forestry Commissions Estate at Kielder inNorthumberland.
24.      Conclusions.There are at present approximately 2,858,000persons registered as unemployed.    Of these 2,303,000are men over 18 years of age and of these it is known that at least 711,000 have &quot;been continuously umemployed for six months or more,  and 403,000 for more than a year;these two latter figures indicate the size of the realcore of stubborn and continued unemployment.    Amongst the mare to be found large numbers of young men, especiallyin areas such as South Wales, the North East Coast andLanarkshire who have never had experience of regular employment.    Whether viewed from the standpoint ef thefuture of the nation or of the interests of the young menthemselves, this last part of the problem seems to us tobe of special gravity and specially needing some remedy or at least some measure of palliation.      We have, therefore,thought it right first of all to consider what can be donein regard to it and the proposals made by us for develop-ment of occupation, physical training and education aredevised primarily with reference to it.      They will also,of course, be applicable to other classes of the unemployed,and this applies in a greater degree to our proposals asregards allotments.Although at first sight our proposals may seem tocover only a small number, they do, at any rate, make a beginning, and we should hope that by the end of the first12 months they will have acquired substantial momentum.    Itis clear, however, that they are limited in scope and wetherefore propose, within our Terms of Reference,  to examineproposals of somewhat wider scope, including the possibilities-ities presented by Small Holdings and Land Settlement.
We intend to deal with these and other matters in aSecond Report.Signed on leehalf ef the Committee13 LA WARR.CHAIRMAN.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. ,October 24th9 1932.
APPENDIX III.CABINET.RET. UNEMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE.I.P. 564 (S3) . INTERIM REPORT.Note by the Treasury.I.      The Report of the Unemployment Committee is drawn on the assumption that no change is made in the existing arrangements for out-door relief and transitional payments.On that basis the Treasury offer the followingobservations1.      Schemes for voluntary work.The Treasury raise no objection to the proposalsof the Committee under this head subject to the followingpoints(1)      The scheme should definitely be described asexperimental.      Only indeed on this basis could theGovernment justify commencing it without prior legisla-tive sanction.(2)      The details of the scheme of grants should besettled between the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury.(3)      The proposed encouragement of the provision of educational facilities for the unemployed referred to inparagraph 5 should be reserved for consideration untilthe Committees now examining Local Expenditure have reported and the policy of the Government as regardslocal expenditure has been determined.Attention should, however, be drawn to the possibledanger which might be involved in the adoption of the proposaby themselves as a new Government plan for dealing with theunemployment problem.      It would be difficult to get   themlooked at in the right perspective; much more would &quot;be expect
from them than they could produce.      The Report itselfmakes it clear that the scheme proposed would effect verylittle in the first year and indeed gives explicitwarning against making exaggerated estimates of its immediate effect.2.    Allotments for the Unemployed.The Committee agree that for the Season 1933nothing more can he done.      Their scheme for the Season1934 the Treasury regard as premature and in any event asopen to grave objections.The scheme envisages that Local Authorities willbe encouraged to acquire land provided that no loss willbe incurred.      It is very doubtful whether they would feelsufficient confidence to embark on the scheme without a promise of State assistance in the event of loss andprobably the proposals would be wholly abortive unless a promise of Exchequer subsidy were made.      This would involveoperating for the first time the Agricultural Land(Utilisation) Act 1931 which is entirely in abeyance.      Suchaction would also be particularly unfortunate at the presenttime as the Committees now considering local expenditure are about to report.      There has been a good deal of criticism to the effect that Local Authorities incur heavycommitments because they are under constant pressure fromthe Government to expand their services.     A circularpressing for activity in any particular field might wellstultify the drive for all round economy and cast doubts onthe Government&apos;s sincerity in inviting the co-operation ofLocal Authorities in an enquiry into expenditure.II.      The fore-going observations are based on theassumption, as stated, that no change is made in the present arrangements for outdoor relief and transitional payments.
The Treasury observe, however,  that consideration is nowbeing given to the formulation of a permanent scheme fordealing with the able-bodied unemployed and for this reason it would seem premature to come to any decision on theCommittee&apos;s recommendations until it is seen how they would work in with any scheme that may be adopted.      There is nothing to be lost from the point of view of work this winter by postponing consideration of the two schemes;while they could be viewed in a better perspective if theywere presented as part of a permanent scheme.      For these reasons the Treasury strongly suggests that a decision onthe Committee&apos;s Report should be postponed.III.      The Kielder Estate.      The Committee have added totheir two main recommendations a proposal for a Ministry ofLabour residential labour centre on the Kielder Estate ofthe Forestry Commission.     Nothing is said in the Report ofthe additional cost to the Forestry Commission involved inthe proposal and it would seem to need closer examinationfrom the financial aspect than the Committee have so fargiven :t.      Prima facie a scheme costing at the rate of  32per head for running expenses in addition to initial capital cost, to additional expense to the Forestry Commission and to ordinary payments of relief is more costly than can well becontemplated in the present circumstances.
