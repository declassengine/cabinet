The Prime Minister said that he wished to consult his colleagues on the position arising out of the resignation of Liberal Ministers, and more particularly as to whether the Government were still justified incalling themselves a National Government.     Althoughtwo liberals remained in the Cabinet those who hadresigned controlled the Liberal .3arty machine-..     If theCabinet thought it right to continue in the new conditions something ought to be placed on record.The President of the Board of Trade expressed thehope that the view would not&apos;be adopted that they were nota National Government. The Government were in office as representing a wider view than was usually to befound in a Party.     After listening.to the discussion that morning he himself felt very strongly that thePrime Minister should continue in Office.     The PrimeMinister&apos;s own position in Europe and in America was of world-wide importance.The President of the Board of Trade&apos;a remarks met with, general approval.The Lord President of the Council recalled that, in replying to a letter from the Prime Minister on the subjectof the present difficulties, he had said that the PrimeMinister&apos;s own duty was clear;     he had taken command ofthe ship for a definite purpose and must see it through.No member of the Conservative Party thought otherwise.They intended to s ee the business through together and toreach a successful conclusion.The Secretary of State for War, as Leader of the Houseof Lords, endorsed the Lord President1s statement.The Prime Minister said that he was willing to continue,but he recalled that when the Government was formedthere had been three signatories to the arrangement;one of these had now withdrawn.     He would do his best tofinish this business.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that the Ottawa Bill has advanced to a conditionfar as a/could be reached by officials only, and now requiredreviouseference:gjabinet 47(32), Cabinet considerationlonclus ion 1).Committee should be formed.He suggested that a cabinet a.In reply to a suggestion that a Memorandum shouldbe prepared dealing with the connection between the ottawa   Agreements and the World Financial and EconomicConference, the President of the Board of Trade saidthat the matter was under consideration in his Depart-ment.     He had been considering negotiations withforeign countries but the Danish Minister was away, andthe Argentine Ambassador was not yet ready to discussthe matter.     He felt that these two nations would heuseful ones on which to test out the effects of the ottawa Agreements.     He promised a Memorandum on thesubject in due course.The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew attention to an important misprint, which in the great pressure at the end of the Conference had crept into theIn the penultimate&apos;This had beenagreed to by Mr. Bennett, and the corresponding article of the United Kingdom - Australian Agreement (Article 10)contained the word &quot;may&quot;.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatthe Dominions Office had this alteration in hand andwere in consultation on the subject with the canadian government.The Cabinet agreed that a Cabinet committee composed as follows:-United Kingdom - Canadian Agreement.of Article 11line/the word &quot;shall&quot; ought to be &quot;may&quot;,

EDUCTION ANDIMITATION OFtfiGNTS.VP       *previous reference:Cabinet 45(32),Conclusion 4).3.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said itwas necessary for him to ask that the Cabinet should carry out a thorough examination of the disarmamentposition in connection with the European situation, andhe felt that this could best be achieved at a special meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed.-To meet on Friday next, September 30th,1932, at 11.30 a.m. , for consideration of theabove question.
INDIA.$proposed Legis-lation to replace the emergency powers Ord.finance.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(32), Con-clusion 2.)fXI (,3k) 3.4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (CP,-311 (32))covering a Note on the Government of India&apos;s Billfor dealing with the Civil Disobedience Movement.It was explained that the existing Ordinance wouldexpire on December 30th next, and that it&apos; was outof the question for local Governments,  or at anyrate some of them, to surrender their special powersIt had already been decided (a) to proceed by legislation and not by a further Ordinance,  and(h) that the Government of India should legislate for the powers likely to be necessary in Indiagenerally, and local Governments for the moreextraordinary powers necessary only in particularlybad areas .It was anticipated that the general Bill couldonly be passed into law by the use of the Viceroy&apos;scertifying powers;    and it was feared that theresentment which this would cause might prejudiceboth the co-operation of Indian Liberals in the reforms Programme., and the chances of the ottawa agreement in the Assembly., -The Secretary of State was anxious to lessenthis inevitable resentment, and his provisionalview was that the measure should be a three years&apos;Bill (the Government of India, on the other hand,would have preferred a permanent Bill, in order to insure the future autonomous Fyovi sional Governmentsagainst the recurrence of civil disobedience);that, so far as possible, the powers should comeinto force by notification and should not be partof the normal law.    and that if strong objectionwere taken to the provision for the payment by- 5 -
ad:parents of fines imposed upon their children thtisshould not form part of the certified Bill.He was anxious for the Government of India tobe in possession of the Cabinefs general viewbefore the Select Committee Stage of the Billearly in October.   The Cabinet could, if necessary,consider the matter again, in the light of theproceedings in the Select Committee, before the Billreached the Assembly in November.The Cabinet agreed generally with the views ofthe Secretary of State for India, whom they invitedto watch the situation during the Committee stage of the Bill, and to report to them if necessary.They also authorised the Secretary of State toinform the Government of India that their view?tentatively, was as stated in his Memorandum.In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State was asked to keep his mind open to thepossibility that, when the Bill emerged fromCommittee, a situation might arise In which?, procedure by ordinance might become less objectionable .In connection with this question some stress was laid on the importance of not doing anything to jeopardise the United Kingdom - India agreement reached at Ottawa,  la. point which the Secretaryof State informed the Cabinet he had very much inmind.
91 54) i dINDIA.Modificationof CommunalAward.(previous reference:Cabinet 46(32), Con-clusion 6.)5.        The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (CP.-318 (32))covering -(i) the text of the Agreement reached between the caste Hindus and theDepressed Classes on September 24th,under which the representation ofthe Depressed Classes in the newlegislatures was to be by generalconstituencies, within which seatswould be reserved for them:(ii) His Majesty&apos;s Governments announce-ment of September 26th, accepting the above Agreement as a variation of their Communal Award of August4th, subject to the reservationthat certain points contained inthe Agreement must be regarded asstill under consideration:    these were points lying outside the scopeof the Government Award.In his covering Note the Secretary of Stateexplained that the Government announcement hadbeen approved by the Prime Minister;    in view ofMr Gandhi&apos;s condition there had not been time to delay publication pending consultation with theCabinet.The Cabinet took note of,  and approved theaction of the Prime Minister and the Secretary ofState for India in the above matter.
6.        The Cabinet had under consideration a Memoran-dum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(C.P.-308 (32)) on the question of the status ofHis Majesty?s Representative in Iraq after thecoming into force of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of alliance.    It was explained in the Memorandum thatthe actual status of the British representativewould be that of Ambassador, with permanent prece-dence over the diplomatic representatives of allother Powers.    Owing to the Treaty and to thepresence of the Royal Air Force, the situation would remain unusual, and it would be desirable for the ambassador to have unusually full information athis disposal.The earlier view of the Secretary of State forIndia had been that the Ambassador should be in aposition to call upon the British Advisers to the iraqi   Government for information.   This, it hadbeen realised, might render the position of thoseAdvisers untenable, and Sir Samuel Hoare was nowin agreement with Sir John Simon that the best plan would be to make a private arrangement with king feisal and the Iraqi Prime Minister for the^Ambassador to receive from time to time any news of importance affecting the internal security ofthe country through a single official, namely, the senior British Adviser.The Ambassador would,  in addition, receiveinformation of increasing value from the BritishConsular Officers who were about to be appointed invarious parts of Iraq.This informal arrangement should meet therequirements of the situation so long as Sir F.Humphrys occupied the post of Ambassador;   and it ought to be practicable for him, before his
eventual retirement, to obtain a written promise of similar facilities for his successor.The Cabinet took note of the agreement reached between the Secretary Of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State forIndia as summarised above.
7. The Cabinet were reminded that, at theMeeting referred to in the margin, a general discussion had taken place on the subject of thesecond instalment of the cut in Police pay, as aresult of which it had been agreed  (a) To accept a proposal that theHome Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, in thelight of the discussion, should now prepare a definite scheme forthe solution of the difficulty, andshould discuss it with the Treasury:(b) That their scheme should, be submittedto the Prime Minister with a view tocirculation to the Cabinet, and ifthey encountered insurmountabledifficulties they should reportthem to the Prime Minister, who should consider how they would bedealt with.At the present Meeting the Cabinet had thefollowing Papers under consideration:-A Note by the Secretary (C.P.-302&apos;(32)) covering a letter addressedto the PrimeMinister on September13th, in which the Home Secretaryreferred to the scheme which theSecretary of State for Scotlandand he had prepared in pursuanceof the Cabinet Conclusion referredto above.   Their scheme, which hadbeen based upon information collected from 230 Authorities, and which took account of the special economieseffected during the year, had contemplated a second cut of 2-g- percent.   They had not discussed their plan with the Treasury, for that department had declined to agree toany modification of the 10,per centcut.   The matter thus remained inthe hands of the Prime Minister, andSir Herbert Samuel, in view of hispledge of September 25th, 1931,expressed his strong conviction thatthe Government would be taking a wrongcourse if,  in determining the secondinstalment of the cut, they failed totake the special economies intoaccount ,A Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP.-310 (32)) covering a Memorandum by the Permanent Secretaryto the Treasury, in which the argumentsused by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland were examined under two heads:-- 10 -
(a) Consideration of merits, of equityand of the national issues involved.Sir Warren Pis her was clear that ifpreferential treatment were given tothe Police, the remainder of theCrown Services would argue unanswer-ably that the relaxation could notbe withheld from themselves;    thisview was reinforced by a letter fromthe Admiralty and the War Office(Annex 2) .   The unemployed on the&quot;dole&quot; would also claim, that theirlot should be alleviated;    and thepublic at large (and particularly those inclined to strike for improvements in their conditions)could take it as an authoritativesign that the lean period was over.Another very serious aspect of thematter was the certainty of a heavyBudget deficit this year, and theprospect of a still larger deficitnext year.   The results of a surrender to the Police might be disastrous.(b) The question of pledges:    the PrimeMinister&apos;s announcement of September21st, 1931 was   and had been understood by all branches of thePublic Service to be   an unqualifiedpledge embodying the principle of equalsacrifice;    and the subsequent statement by the Home Secretary must be regardedas having been made in the light ofthat announcement and in no sense asover-ruling it.A Memorandum. (.C.P.-319 (32)) in which theHome Secretary, replying briefly toSir Warren Fisher&apos;s Memorandum, claimed that there was no question of any relaxation-tion or concession, but merely ofabiding by the course announced a yearearlier.    In particular, he wished to insist that the Prime Minister&apos;announcement could not be taken asover-riding his own.   This had been madein the Prime Minister&apos;s presence four days later.   No objection had then beentaken to it, publicly or privately, bythe Prime Minister, by any of hiscolleagues, or by the Treasury.   His(Sir Herbert Samuel&apos;s) failure to submit a revised scheme to the Cabinet Committeewas simply due to the impossibility of saving the appearance of the 10 per cent,cut, while fulfilling the substance ofthe pledge given to the Police that thebenefit of the special economies shouldaccrue to them.    It would be doublyimpossible to do so if they had to conform to the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s condition that the scheme&quot;must not give away with one hand whaty/B,G received with the other&quot;.- 11 -
ey ct f\4. L UIn the course of a statement setting forth the dilemma in which the Government were placed, the PrimeMinister pointed out that the resigning Home secretary had pledged the Government to take savings into account in imposing the second cut, hut that if these pledgeswere honoured very serious trouble was liable to arise inthe Defence Services and other branches of the PublicService.      As a result of a consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer the decision had been postponed for a month and an announcement made to this effect.      In the course of the discussion the suggestion was made that the Cabinet ought to be informed of thenature of the economies made in respect of the Police.It should be ascertained,  for example, how far theseeconomies consisted merely of postponing payments.The Cabinet agreed;-(a) That the Treasury should be askedto examine in detail the proposedadministrative ecomomies, and that theChancellor of the Exchequer should reportto the Cabinet on this question.In making this examination the treasury were asked to distinguish between measuresof continuing economy and temporaryeconomies due, for example, to postponedpayments.(b) That the question should be decided* as soon as possible after the appointmentof the new Home Secretary.
*5 ^)4i 4)WITHgssiA.8. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum (CP.306(32))by the President of the Board of Trade, covering a Reporton Export Credits for Russia.     The Export CreditspreviousJabinet 46(32), Committee had met with difficulty in giving effect tofonclusion 4).the Cabinet&apos;s wish that, of the  1,450,000 of additionalF.ft.i%(W) it-credits which they were authorised to guarantee up tothe end of the present year, a substantial proportionshould be credits not exceeding 12 months.     after consulting the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of theExchequer, the President had asked the Committee toproceed at their discretion in the manner which they themselves had recommended - i.e. that they should obtainthe best terms possible, provided always that the lengthof credit covered by the guarantees in no case exceeded18 months.The President mentioned that the matter had attractedconsiderable notice in the press, but that this was in no way attributable to the action of the Export credits guarantee Department, who had ahdered strictly to theCabinet&apos;s instruction that no announcement should be made.*    The Prime Minister instructed the Secretaryto the Cabinet to place the question of denunciation of the   Russian Trade Agreement on the Agenda  of theCabinet at an early meeting.
SITUATION INplA.. . e9.       The Cabinet took note of Reports by local governments on the Political Situation in India,circulated for the information of his colleagues by(previous reference:Cabinet 46(32),  the Secretary of State for India (CP. 294(32),Conclusion 6). ^ , ,CP. 296(32), CP.  301(32) and CP. 309(32)).
9 9 310.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. 303(32))with which were circulated.-Annex I - a copy of an undated letter fromMr. de Valera (received on September 10th)stating that the Free State Government formallyaccepted the proposals brought back from Dublinby Miss Ellis.Annex II - a copy of those proposals.Annex III - a copy of the Secretary of State&apos;reply to Mr. de Valera. dated September 14th.This letter made it clear that Miss Ellis had visited Dublin in a private capacity, and thatthe proposals which she had brought back, asthey contained no guarantee of a speedy terminationof the dispute, afforded no satisfactory basis fora settlementj    and repeated His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s former declarations that they could beready to consider any proposals for ending thepresent deadlock which accepted, as the basis ofall discussion, the Treaty and the continuance ofthe Irish Free State as a member of the BritishCommonwealth.      They were ready either to refer the question of the Land Annuities to arbitrationwithin the Commonwealth, or to negotiate, on thebasis either of the present situation or of therestoration of the status quo as it existed beforethe Annuities were withheld, always provided thatthere was a prospect of finality.The Cabinet took note of the above,  and the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs informed his colleagues ofthe possibility that in the following week   negotiations might be opened up with Mr. de Valera at the latter&apos;request.
