1.   The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he was in communication with the Speaker of theHouse of Commons on the subject of a letter that hadbeen addressed to him, with a corresponding letterto the Speaker, from the so-called &quot;hunger-marchers&quot;,requesting facilities to be received at the Bar ofthe House of Commons.   After consultation with the speaker he himself proposed to reply to the letterby enclosing for information a copy of the columnsof Hansard recording last Thursday&apos;s Debate.   the speaker, in his letter, would make clear that thematter did not concern him except so far as he hadto see that the Rules of the -House were observed.When Mr McGovern presented his petition today thePrime Minister proposed to say very little, but ifnecessary he would state that he would carefullyexamine his proposed Resolution and announce his decision on it on the morrow.. If Mr McCovern pressed to know what the procedure was to be, he would reply that %h days had already been assigned to a Debate onUnemployment and that legislation was to be introducedshortly.   His reply would be carefully drawn up and read, and should, he thought, suffice without anyspecial facilities being given for a debate.The Home Secretary asked that the Prime minister would consider steps being taken to remove thehunger-marchers out of London, where they constituted a heavy burden on the Local Authorities and the Police.The Cabinet agreed  That the question of getting rid of the &quot;hunger-marchers&quot; from london should form the subject ofa Memorandum to be prepared by theMinister of Labour in consultationwith the Minister of Health.
cabinet procedure.circulation of Papers .(previous reference:Cabinet 73(30),  Con-clusion 16 .)6^V2.   The Prime Minister pointed to the growinghabit of Ministers circulating Memoranda to theCabinet at very short notice and without observingthe five days laid down in the Cabinet&apos;s Rules ofProcedure.   He illustrated this by the Papers whichhad been prepared in connection with the discussions on Disarmament.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that immediately after the decision of theCabinet at their last Meeting he had put in hand his memorandum.    It had not been possible, however, tocomplete this before the evening of Friday, October28th.    He had then brought it to the Prime Ministerpersonally, in order to obtain his authority to circulate.The Secretary of State for War recalled that atthe time of M, Herriot&apos;s visit the Prime Ministerand the Lord President of the Council had suggested to him that the Chief of the Imperial General staff should be, asked to prepare an Appreciation.   this document had been still in course of preparation whenthe Cabinet took their decision that an attempt -wasto be made this day to reach agreements as to theirDisarmament policy.    In the circumstances he aad feltthat if the Paper was to be of any value it ought tobe circulated before the present Meeting, and he had asked the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to try and complete it in time.   He had sent an&quot;&apos;advance copyto the Secretary to the Cabinet on Friday, October28th, in order that he might obtain the PrimeMinister&apos;s permission to circulate, and it had infact been circulated on the Friday evening.
0^7The Secretary of State for Air said that he had only received the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum late on the evening of Friday, October 38th.    If he hadbeen consulted beforehand he and the Foreign Secretarycould probably have arranged a paragraph on AirDisarmament acceptable to the Air Ministry .    In thecircumstances he felt that there was no alternative but to circulate a Memorandum, even at the eleventhhour.The Secretary of State for War added that he also had to have a technical Memorandum prepared, which hewould circulate before the end of the present Meeting.The Prime Minister said that in the various discus-sions on Disarmament one of the difficulties had beenthat on nearly every occasion the material circulatedto the Cabinet had not been available sufficientlyearly to enable members to consider the subject as awhole before the different Meetings.    There had nearlyalways been some loose strands, as on the present occasion.
9 K Oo J oREDUCTION and limitation OPARMAMENT S .(previous reference:Cabinet 55(32),  Con-clusion 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Reduction and limitation of Armaments:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (C.P.-360 (32))pointing out the urgency of a decisionon the policy to be adopted at theDisarmament Conference, partly owingto the near approach of a special meeting of the League about Manchuriaand the Lytton Report, at which herr von Neurath will be presentand an opportunity will arise foran exchange of views with germany on Disarmament:    partly owing tothe forthcoming Meeting of the bureau of the Disarmament Conference onNovember 3rd;    partly owing to theforthcoming production of the Frenchplan, of which a forecast has alreadybeen given to the French Chamber.Attached to the Memorandum was adraft form of Declaration on Germany&apos;claim to equality of rights, which is reproduced in the Appendix.   this form of Declaration, it will be seen,suggests that the German claim toequality of rights should be conceded,on the understanding that Germanyaccepts an obligation that the meetingof her claim will not involve anyattempt by violent means to disturbthe existing territorial regime inEurope.   The draft Declaration furthersuggests four principles by which theGerman claim to equality of rightsshould be fully met .   The third ofthese principles is as follows&quot; (iii) The principle must be accepted that all States should contentthemselves with the same hindof arms, but any changes inGermany&apos;s fighting strengthmust be carried out in such away as not to conflict withthe principle of no rearmament&quot;.Annexed to the draft Declaration was an explanatory Note showing how effectmight be given to the above principle,
THE PRIME MINISTER directed the attention of theCabinet first to the form of draft Declaration.Although this was a very important matter and a &quot;hey&quot;point in constructing the Government&apos;s policy, hethought it would be necessary to begin by indicatingvery firmly that the main policy of the Governmentwas Peace, that they regarded disarmament as a partof that policy, and that disarmament could not bedissociated from this policy of peace.   During theprevious two days he ha.d given much attention to this aspect of the question.   He thought, however, in thefirst instance, it would be useful to work on theSecretary of State&apos;s draft Declaration, going backandlater to the filling in of the framework/the detailsof the picture.After the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had explained the principles on which the declaration was drawn, the Prime Minister said he gathered thatthe intention was to make clear that we were preparedto make the moral gesture of a declaration of Germanequality but expected that Germany should undertaketo do&apos; nothing that would be a new cause of unsettle-ment in Europe.    If that were accepted,  the firstcorollary would, be that these two points could not bedissociated one from another.    It could not be aquestion of one part of the arrangement being adoptedfirst and the other afterwards:    the whole arrangementmust be agreed to simultaneously.   This pointed to thenecessity of bringing Germany into the negotiationsas soon as possible.   After a brief reference to thePaper by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,wrhich, though written from a military point of view,contained, he said, a number of points which it was worth while for politicians to keep in mind, he asked what would be the nature of the assurances we should ask from Germany? ..5-
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that the first point to clear up was histhird principle (quoted above), that all States shouldcontent themselves with the same kind of arms, etc.The other point was an accompaniment to this.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR asked if thatmeant that everyone had to come down to Germanyrslevel?THE FOREIGN SECRETARY explained that this was notthe intention.   The proposal was that Germany shouldbe allowed other weapons, subject to there being no increase in her fighting strength or in her expendi-ture for defence.It was pointed out, however, by several membersof the Cabinet, that the concession to Germany ofcertain weapons, now forbidden, would in fact logicallyincrease her strength, even with the limitations laiddown.   That, at any rate, would be the criticism ofthe stricter partisans of disarmament.    The onlylogical course that would meet their point of view would be to bring the armaments of other nations into line with those allowed to Germany.   The suggestion was made that it was desirable to get away from suchphrases as &quot;the principle of no re-armament&quot; if itwere impossible to come down to the German level, andthat it would be wiser to use other phrases, such asthe Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion of &quot;measures to securethe peace of the world1&apos; .THE PRIME MINISTER thought that when the Cabinetcame to details there-were a number of phrases thatneeded re-consideration&apos;,    &quot;Expansion of military strength&quot; might, for example, be   a better phrasethan &quot;increase of armaments&quot;.   The plan under consider-ation included, first, a declaration in favour of
equality, and, second, a declaration of what we wanted as the result.   This involved a discussion as to what Germany was going to do when she obtainedher freedom.    It was proposed to obtain a declarationfrom Germany and to make our declaration in return.If, however, Germany were acting in bad faith, adeclaration from the Powers would make it easier foTher herea??ter to effect her intentions and to go onto her next position.    She would say, &quot;I cannotdefend myself, and all I am doing is to re-organisemy forces and to provide some new armaments to make this possible&quot;    If Germany did not intend to contri-bute to the peace of Europe, then it was for considera-tion whether it would not be better to leave her totear up the Treaty.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said he would, like to putinto the Treaty that the peace of the world and disarm-ament were the ideal.    If we could not get disarmamentto the German level we must allow her some expansion,on condition (l) that it was kept within certaindefined limits;    and (2.) that satisfactory assuranceswere given.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he hadalready communicated the gist of his views to theForeign Secretary.   Those views had been formed before he had read the Memorandum by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, but were confirmed by reading it.   Hethought it did not matter very much whether germany was allowed specimens of the forbidden weapons or not,since she probably already possessed such specimens.He gathered from the Memorandum by the Chief of theImperial General Staff that Germany would, not obtainvery much advantage from this, and that in any event
she would be able to produce armaments comparativelysoon after the outbreak, of a war, when her industrialmobilisation scheme had come into effect.   He under-stood it was now suggested to insist on a declaration that Germany should not upset the territorial settle-ment of Europe during the period of the Convention.That was an undertaking that Germany could easilygive, because in any event she could not takeaggressive action before 1938, which was the begin-ning of the dangerous period.   The French reply wouldbe that the German assurances were not worth thepaper they were written on, that Germany neverintended to keep them, and that she would be givingsomething for nothing.   He rather doubted the resulton the French of a proposal put in that way.    It couldonly prove a futile gesture.    He was anxious that anyproposal that the British Government made should, leadto practical results, since one of the criticisms ofthe Government was that their proposals led to nothing.The root   cause was the fear of France and her alliesthat Germany was going to re-gain her old. positionin Europe and tear up the Treaty of Versailles, which meant that tine security of the countries that had gained by the territorial settlement made by that treaty would be in jeopardy.     Consequently manyPowers felt that their very existence depended onthe maintenance of the TreatyiQf Versailles .   Thatsense of fear would not be abolished or lessened byany assurance that was obtained from Germany.    Everyonewas afraid of reducing their armaments without somesecurity that Germany was not re-arming while theydisarmed.    Consequently all proposals based onimmediate disarmament within a very short timeappeared to those nations to be a gamble of their
security on German good faith.   He thought it was too much to ash the nations of Europe to put themselves in that position.   Consequently he had suggested to the Foreign Secretary that perhapsit might be practicable to devise a system of disarmament in gradual stages, each stage depending on German good behaviour in the interval.   Underthis plan no nation would feel itself defencelessduring any of the stages, and no advance would bemade until after a re-examination of the position.By thus taking one step at a time we should neverdiminish the sense of security.    If such an ideaproved acceptable it was conceivable that we mightsecure a restoration of the confidence of the powers in one another and in time reach a point where such questions as the Polish Corridor, Upper Silesia andDanzig, could be discussed.   A concession of theprinciple of equality under some such safeguardswould not arouse the same difficulty with France as would more drastic proposals.   This slower plan might lead to an amount of disarmament much greater thanthat now contemplated,  and thus satisfy the advocates of extreme measures of disarmament.   Another advantage would be that , by giving notice of the various stages of the gradual abandonment of armaments,  the armamentsmanufacturers would receive a warning and wouldrefrain from embarking capital in special weapons and thus avoid their becoming opponents of theabolition of these weapons.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY, while thanking theChancellor of the Exchequer for his contribution of a plan in the present very difficult situation,expressed doubts as to whether Germany would under-take not to re -arm in response merely to a scheme of
gradual disarmament.    The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff thought that Germany intended to re-arm,and in that event she would not accept this plan.Even if she consented to abandon specimens of theforbidden weapons she would probably not agree notto re-organise her forces.    The object behind his plan was to support the moral forces, namely, world opinion and that part of the public opinion in Germany whichwas opposed to re-armament,    In reply to a question by the Chancellor of the Exchequer he said that hehad not intended that the German declaration should,be limited to the period of the Disarmament Treaty.He pointed out that machinery for altering territorialarrangements in the Treaty that proved unduly onerouswas provided by Article XIX of the Covenant,THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY suggested thatthe Armaments Convention and any political Conventionmight be secured far beyond 1938, which would makethe situation easier.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA recalled thathitherto it had always been said at Geneva that it waseasier to get a Convention for a short than for a longt erm.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed,out that if Germany would not give the assurance askedfor she would prejudice her position, more especially as she had signed the Kellogg Pact and the LocarnoTreaties .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR T,VAR thought it probablethethat Germany would givey assurances asked for,  just as she had agreed to sign the Kellogg Pact, but she wouldnot have the least intention of keeping her assurances.Our aim was peace.   He himself doubted if the ForeignSecretaryTs policy would secure that object.
Germany&apos;s avowed intention was to get rid of theTreaty of Versailles .   To a considerable extent this had been accomplished,   The rectification of thePolish Corridor was her next political aim, and shewished to put herself in a position to redress hergrievances on her Eastern Frontier.    She was aiming at this by a very plausible case that she hadpresented as to equality of status .   Her real aim,however, was to rectify what she believed to be theinjustices of her Eastern Frontier, and, perhaps,later on, in the West.   He himself quite agreed withthe early part of the Declaration, but he could notbelieve that the proposed assurances would have any-real value.   He doubted if Germany cared at all aboutthe mobilisation of world opinion.   Other nations hadflouted world opinion:    for example, Italy in theCorfu incident, and Japan in Manchuria.   The real keyto the-situation was that Germany alone desired herarmaments not for defence, but for aggression.   Noother nation in Europe had any aggressive purpose.If Germany was given the opportunity completely tore-arm after an interval of five years, it wrould makewar certain a few years later on when Germany hadre-armed.    In any event Germany would not be able to resort to force for another five years:   but if, atthe end of that time, she could re-arm, she would soondo so and use her armaments to alter the Treaty ofVersailles .    He doubted if France and her allies would be willing to accept ary assurances.    Probablyvery few present in the Cabinet Room would feel muchconfidence in them.   Consequently, if it were truethat Germany desired to re-arm and use force, it wouldbe a great mistake to allow her the opportunity to doso.    If her claim was refused we should affront a
certain amount of public opinion in this country,and there was the danger of throwing Russia into the arms of Germany.   He did not under-rate the dangers of this.   He then drew attention to the new Frenchscheme, which, though not communicated as yet,appeared from the preliminary accounts to offer a real and marked advance in disarmament.    It did not involve any obligations beyond those which we hadalready accepted and which were the maximum that wecould accept.    For his part he would like to adoptthe first half of the Secretary of State&apos;s Declarationof Policy, but to add that recent events in germany had not given us much confidence in the future.   when we were satisfied in that respect we should be willingto go ahead towards equality of armaments,   He wouldadmit that the Germans had a grievance owing to thefact that the other signatories to the Treaty ofVersailles had not disarmed more.   To meet thisgrievance he would examine President Hoover&apos;s proposals,some of which were quite acceptable, and the new french proposals, and see if some definite progress couldnot be made based thereon.   He would tell germany that we would come down to her level when we were satisfied that she had no aggressive intentions.In the meantime he would take steps to advance towardsthe German level and to approach it by successivestages, which could be speeded up if and when Germanyshowed a change of heart.   He was not going intodetails now, but he gave warning that when details were discussed he v/ould have something to say as tothe proposals in regard to tanks and heavy guns.To sum up, his view was that, while he would do anything in the direction of disarmament as a meansof securing peace, he thought it would be a mistake-13-
to adopt measures which would send Europe up inflames ten or fifteen years hence.    In reply to aquestion by the Foreign Secretary as to what he would regard as a satisfactory assurance of peaceful inten-tion by Germany, he said that he would point out the speeches of General von Schleicher and others;   hewould remind the Germans that 1914 was not yetforgotten;   he would make clear that he was not satisfied that the armaments Germany desired were for purely defensive purposes,   He would make clearthat, once satisfied on that point, there would be noreason for Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, whichhad only been introduced as a safeguard against aggression.    In answer to a further question by theForeign Secretary, he said that in reply to thequestion now being asked, &quot;Does the British Governmentadmit the German claim?&quot;, he would say &quot;Not at present,and not until we are satisfied that Germany has noaggressive intentions&quot;.     He would add, however, thatthe answer would be &quot;Yes&quot; as soon as Germany hadsatisfied us.   He added that he had been careful tostate above that he would in the meanwhile proceedwith disarmament on the lines of the very considerable advance contained in our earlier proposals, affecting,for example, tanks, heavy guns, submarines, battle-ships.   He himself would be ready to go as far as to abolish naval and military aviation.   He thought alsothat the&apos; French proposals and the Hoover proposals would offer material for further advance,^HE MINISTER OF AGRICULTUR&quot; AND FISHERIES saidthat while he disagreed with much of the detail ofthe Secretary of State for War&apos;s argument, yet his statement brought to an issue the question of whether we were to propose a plan of our own or to examine the
French plan and the Hoover plan.   Were we to try and get hack the leadership in disarmament byproposing a plan of our own, or merely to examineother people&apos;s proposals?    If the Cabinet could notarrive at agreement on a plan of their own that coursewould be preferable.    In the long run the only security for peace was willingness to fight for it.   The nationat present did not believe that Germany had had asquare deal.   Unless they had that belief it wotildnever be possible to get that surge of public opinionbehind the Government that had supported the Govern-ment of 1914.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if the Cabinet were not willing to agree to the German claim for equalityon the condition of taking great care to ensureguarantees that Germany should not upset the tran-quility of Europe? , If that principle were settledthey could proceed to consider one or two largepoints connected with the political Agreement behind the Disarmament Declaration,     He thotight it might bepossible to get Germany to reaffirm her determination to come into the comity of Europe, to co-operate in maintaining the peace, to observe her various under-fes-kings,.and to refer all questions of controversy tothe League of Nations ,    A Declaration of that kindmight have great effect in Europe and re-establishreal peace.    If we could lead in that it would give along strart in getting back to our position of leader-ship.    Of one thing he was convinced, namely, that noprogramme of items of disarmament wras going to restore the leadership to this country:   there were too manyplans already in the field; . but we might recover the leadership by taking a big political line.   He suggestedthat the first thing to be done was to get Germany
back.    So long as Germany remained away she was ableto throw the blame on to other Powers, includingourselves .THE SECRETARY OF STAmE FOR THE COLONIES said hethought it was already agreed that we could not oppose German equality of status.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the cabinet should not re-consider giving equality of status,but should re-consider their programme and fix on two or three big propositions that would contribute to the peace of Europe.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY drew attention to the three points on which Germany would insist, namely, first,that her limitations of armaments should be in thesame document as those of other Powers;    second, thatthey should be for the same period of time;    and,third,, that she would not come back to the DisarmamentConference without satisfaction on her claim toequality.   He proposed to combine acceptance with adefinite undertaking by Germany.    If she would not give this, we should be in a different moral positionaltogether.    If he were asked &quot;What is the value ofthe undertaking&quot;, he would reply that to get it on record would have &quot;a tremendous effect on the stateof world opinion.    It would also have a great effecton that part of the German public opinion which said&quot;We lost everything last time through tearing up ascrap of paper&quot;.THE PRIME MINISTER said that what would be requiredto carry out this policy was:  (l) A Political AgreementTechnical Disarmament(2) A      / Agreement.   Theycontents of thePolitical Agreement might now be considered.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS beganby stating that he had never contemplated that thePolitical Agreement should be limited to five years.-15-
We could refer to Article XIX of the Covenant, which germany had already been reminded provided facilitiesfor raising any points in the Treaties that wereunduly onerous.   He had been making enquiries aboutthe Treaty of Locarno and the common report thatGermany had undertaken not to attempt to rectify theEastern Frontier except by peaceful means .   the he found,Declaration/was not very obvious, being wrapped up invarious recitals ,    It would be an immense advantage to obtain from Germany a clear statement on the subject.If they refused, we should be in a different positionaltogether.    Sketching out, without preliminary study,the kind of document he contemplated, he said thathis idea was that a draft should be handed round tothe signatories to the Treaty 9f Versailles, whichmight take the form of a mutual undertaking.   He would call attention to the circumstances of the Treaty ofVersailles and the present position in Europe.   Hewould call attention also to Article XIX of theCovenant, and to the Locarno Treaty.   mhe nations that had signed the Treaty of Versailles would thenpledge themselves one to another not to-try and secure any alteration in the boundaries of Europe except by peaceful methods .   His idea was that a declaration onthis subject might be made, in the first instance,either in the House of Commons or at Geneva.    Thiswould, no doubt, lead the Germans to make enquiries.Meanwhile the Geneva Disarmament Conference would, goon, but the arrangement would not come into effectGermany joined, inunless^a political undertaking   simultaneously,THE PRIME MINISTER added that his idea was not a legal document, but a statement of what we were aimiigat.   He thought some such policy as the above was acceptable to many members of the Cabinet, but he did
not feel sure whether the Secretary of State for war was satisfied.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said he had felthound to present a different point of view.   He ashedwhether the idea was to inform the French, italian and American Governments before the plan of a &apos;Political Agreement was announced?THE PRIME MINISTER said that that would have tobe considered carefully when the policy was settled.THE SECRETARY OF S^A^E FOR FOREIGN affairs thought it would be desirable to inform the countries mentioned, but not to enter into an elaborate processof consultation.The Cabinet arranged to resume thediscussion in the Prime Minister&apos;room at the House of Commons at 4 p.m,the same day.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 31,  19 33.
APPENDIX.Draft Form of Declaration on Germany&apos;s Claim toEquality of Rights.In dealing with the claim to equality of rights in the matterof armaments raised by the German Government in their Note of the29th August, 1932, it is necessary to recall that the limitationscontained in Part V of the Treaty of Versailles were imposed as a means of securing the peace of Europe.      It is undoubtedly truethat these limitations were intended to be, and expressed to be,the precursor of the general limitation of armaments.      The UnitedKingdom Government feel under no reproach in this regard, for theircountry has in recent years effected immense reductions.      But the sense of grievance on the side of Germany remains, and the UnitedKingdom Government have throughout been ready and anxious to  join the other Governments represented at Geneva in sincere and far-reaching steps to remove it.      It is not open to question that thehesitation which may have shown itself in certain quarters  in grant-ing the German claim does not proceed from any desire to inflictupon Germany a permanent inferiority of status, which her people would naturally resent, hut from a deep anxiety as to the usewhich might &quot;be made of the new situation and cf the dangers whichwould result to the tranquillity of Europe if an express assurance asto the peaceful intensions of Germany was not forthcoming.      Theworld is entitled to be assured in express and formal terms that themeeting of Germany&apos;s claim will not involve any attempt by violentmeans to disturb the existing territorial regime In Europe.      Theacknowledgment   by others of Germany&apos;s moral right entails upon germany the acceptance of this corresponding obligation.On the assumption that such an assurance is given, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom consider that the German
claim to equality of rights should he fully met in thefallowing manner :-(i) The limitations on Germany&apos;s armamentsshall he contained in the same Disarma-ment Convention as the limitations onthe armaments of ethers;    that is tosay,  the Articles in Part V of theTreaty of Versailles which at presentlimit Germany&apos;s arms will he supersededand Germany&apos;s limitations will hearrived at by the same process and ex-pressed in the same document as thoseof all other countries.(ii) The newly-expressed limitations in thecase of Germany will last for the sameperiod and be subject to the samemethods of revision as those of all othercountries,(iii) The principle must be accepted that all states should content themselves with thesame kinds of arms, but any changes inGermany&apos;s fighting strength must becarried out in such a way as not to con-conflict with the principle of no rearmament,(iv) Similar methods should be adopted forarriving at and expressing the limitationswhich will apply to the armaments ofAustria, Hungary and Bulgaria,
