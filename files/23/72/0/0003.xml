4   &apos; Table of Naval Tonnage Reductions.    In viewof the strong objections raised to the inclusion&quot; of the Table in paragraph 4 of the Telegram.   -the Cabinet agreed that its retention in theDeclaration could not be maintained;    at thesame time the Cabinet felt that the Declarationmust contain an indication that an increase inCruiser tonnage must be contemplated as partof our proposals.     Doubts were expressed whetherthe proposal to insert in paragraph 7 after the sentence ending &quot;from 74 to 52&quot; the words&quot;numerical reduction in the British Navy has there fore already been applied on a very large scale and, indeed. Cruiser numbers may requirespecial consideration hereafter&quot; satisfied this requirement.    It was pointed out that this wordingwould be taken to mean that no increase ofCruiser tonnage was in contemplation;    the true position would, however, have to be disclosed in debate in the near future, and we should layourselves open to charges of insincerity andbreach of faithc     The substitution of &quot;will&quot;for &quot;may&quot; in the last sentence would go far tosafeguard the position in this respect.After some discussion, in the course ofwhich emphasis was laid on the importance, atthis critical juncture in the Lausanne andGeneva negotiations, of meeting the views of thePrime Minister and his colleagues, the cabinet agreed to accept the alternative set out inparagraph 5 of the telegram, subject to thefollowing observation :-
&quot;Sole object of Cabinet is to avoid a charge .,.       Nof bad faith.   We have no intention of makingair/ commitment as to any increase in numbers.We merely wish to preserve freedom of action and avoid being charged with breach of faithif we feel bound to. exercise this freedomhereafter.    For this reason we prefer will^D *aayBut if colleagues at Geneva aresatisfied that we can escape charge of bad faith if may is used, we are prepared to accept that word.&quot;The Cabinet agreed  (l) That their Sonclusions on the points inthe Secretary of State&apos;s Telegram shouldbe at once communicated to the Secretary.of State for Foreign Affairs at Geneva +(For this message as coiimiunicated seeAppendix II).(2) That the Declaration should be revised inaccordance with the Conclusions referredto in (l) above.(5) That the Declaration in Command Paper formshould be presented to Parliament onJuly 7th. (For the Declaration as presented to Parliament see Appendix III).(4) To request the Lord President of theCouncil to confer with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury and the Leadersof the Opposition in regard to theprocedure to be followed in view of thefact that it was estimated that the reading of the Declaration would take about 45minutes.*NOTES. Shortly after &quot;the end of the meeting, theConclusions of the Cabinet were communicated tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs atGeneva,   A telephonic   message in reply wasreceived from the&apos;Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs at 11 p,m.    This message, after thankingthe Cabinet for the way in which the wishes of&apos;thePrime Minister and his colleagues had been met,stated that those Ministers were willing that&quot;will&quot; should be substituted for &quot;may&quot; in the newsentence to be inserted in paragraph 7, the concluding words of vfa. ich would accordingly read -&quot;Cruiser numbers wi 11 require special considerationthereafter&quot;.      It was understood that all the otheragreed alterations would be incorporated in theDeclaration.XIt was subsequently decided that the lord president of the Council should read the DecHa rationin the House of Commons on Thursday, July 7th 1932,and that the approximate time at which he v;ouldbegin to read the Declaration would be 3.30 p.m.Geneva was notified accordingly.fiitehali-Gardens, S.W.1.Sth.

DISARMAMEKT   POLICY.Telegram to the- Lord President of the Council from the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs,dated 6th July, 19320x        Following from Secretary of State.Your telegram unnumbered of to-day.We have received Cabinet comments and number the points in this reply for convenience hereafter.1.      Paragraph 4.      We propose &quot;find themselves very largely in accord with President Hoover&apos;s proposals&quot;.      This meets theCabinet criticism tut is much to be preferred to earlier words,especially as Cabinet accept without objection paragraph 6.We are convinced that a mere reference to &quot;spirit&quot; wouldbe widely misunderstood.2..    Paragraph 5 (d). Tanks.      We have carefully consideredthe Cabinet suggestions and propose to alter (d) thus:In second sentence strike out &quot;heavy tanks by which they meanthose tanks&quot; and substitute &quot;tanks above a weight of 20 tons&quot;.v&quot; 1In last sentence but one,  for &quot;my&quot; read &quot;this&quot;. /   Omit finalsentence &quot;altogether.      We earnestly hope these suggestionswill meet Cabinet view.      First sentence of (d)   is mostimportant since Hoover declaration confirms this principle andit is already unanimously adopted by Disarmament Conference onmotion moved by myself in support of qualititive disarmament.Our present suggestions cover every point the Cabinet wishes to make and we strongly deprecate further additional sentences.3.      Paragraph 8.      Line 9 ? We cannot follow this commentwhich appears to be based on some misapprehension.      Our draftincludes the figures of the earlier draft in every case exceptthat it speaks of &quot;American proposal&quot; instead of &quot;the american proposal to reduce 15 capital ships to 10.&quot;      The former is obviously better.x Copy annexed for convenience of reference.^ This printer&apos;s error had already been corrected,,
4.     Table of Naval Tonnage Reductions.We cannot help thinking that the Cabinet is under theimpression that the Draft under consideration ,includes the sentence giving total ultimate reduction of 281,700 tons.This sentence was struck out and we strongly feel there isno reason for inserting Table.      The reduction in size of cruisers is not the cause of the view that their numbersmay have to be increased;    an increase in cruiser tonnageis no part of this proposal since the Admiralty view remains the same, whether size of cruisers is reduced or not.      Ihave spoken to the Chancellor of the Exchequer who definitelyobjects to inclusion of Table.      Its insertion would be used as a Cabinet and Treasury decision to build in 1937 and wouldgive unparalleled opportunity to belittle British proposals to reduce size of ships with which it has no connectionwhatever.      I sincerely trust that now it is appreciated thatthe document contains no reference to total tonnage reduction,paragraphs 8 and 9 may be left as they stand.5.      As an alternative which might minimise but not remove the injury that will be done by raising this issue now,  itwould be possible to insert in paragraph 7 after the sentenceending &quot;from 74 to 52&quot; the following: &quot;numerical reduction inthe British Navy has therefore already been applied on a verylarge scale and,  indeed, cruiser numbers may require special consideration hereafter&quot;.6.      We much regret the inconvenience caused to colleagues athome by our. latest comments, but  one needs to be on the spotto realise fully the difficulties we are trying to handle andthe dangers of provocative statements.
The Cabinet have considered your proposed alterations in the Disarmament Statements and make the following comments:-Your paragraph 4.     The Cabinet would prefer theoriginal words.    It is not accurate to say that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are in full accord with the&quot;substance&quot; of the proposals.Your paragraph 5 (d)0    The Cabinet prefer theoriginal draft sub-paragraph on Tanks.    They think youramended form beginning as it does with an affirmationthat they are &quot;entirely at one with President Hoover&quot;in desiring the application of the principle thatspecifically offensive weapons should be prohibited, andending with the statement &quot;but as I have already said weare in entire agreement with President Hoover as to theprinciple which he seeks to apply to the subject of tanks&quot; seems like an assertion that they only seek toretain light tanks as not being specifically offensive,and that if they could be persuaded that any tank above a certain weight was offensive, they would be prepared to abolish it.    This is not the fact.    The retention of thelight and medium size tank is vital to a non-conscriptarmy9 and could not be abandoned.   Further, 20-tons isthe limit which we have publicly adopted and which theAmerican Experts at Geneva are themselves willing to accept.COSECRET.DIGARIiAMENT POLICY.TELEGRAM TO THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs as APPROVED AT THE MEETING&apos; OF THE CABINET ON WEDNESDAY,JULY 6th, 1932 AT 11 a.m.
Your paragraph 8, line 9._ &quot;The American proposal would leave the size of these enormously expensive vessels,and the calibre of their guns untouched in any futureconstruction of capital ships&quot;.    The Cabinet prefer theoriginal draft.    They think the figures and language ofthe original will greatly impress public opinion at home.Table of Naval Tonnage Reductions.    The Cabinet thinkit quite essential that the announcement should contain aplain and explicit statement of the ultimate increase in the cruiser tonnage.    They think that without this inclusionthe proposals are disingenuous.   The attempted concealmentwill certainly he detected as our requirements are wellknown to the Americans: and as we shall certainly be questioned at home, the effect&apos;will be most damaging andwill cast doubt on the sincerity and frankness of the wholeannouncement.    The Cabinet, therefore3 have decidedunanimously that, either this table should be retained(which seems to them the simplest plan) or that a statement should be included saying in terms that this increase incruiser tonnage is an essential part of our proposals.The other suggested modifications in the statement are accepted.Your te 1 egram No .4-7.    The proposal to indicate possiblenon-replacement of capital ships in 1937 we regard as quiteimpossibleo

DECLARATION OF BRITISH DISARMAMENT POLICY.1. The Disarmament Conference, has reached a stage when wemust review the present position of our discussions and. co-operatewithout loss of time in reaching and registering practical conclusions.The Government of the United Kingdom most cordially welcomepresident Hoover&apos;s declaration as a contribution to this end. we welcome it? alike because it calls for a really substantial measure of disarmament and because it seeks to apply the two principles of quantitative and of qualitative limitation. As President Hoover says,&apos; Reduction should be carried out not only by broad general cots111 armaments, but by increasing the comparative power of defencethrough decreases in the power of the attack.&quot; We desire to associateourselves with these conceptions and to contribute all that we canto securg their practical application. The United Kingdom Cabinetlias considered President Hoover&apos;s Declaration in this spirit and whatam about to say on certain practical points is said with a deep desireto promote co-operation and agreement.Success at Geneva depends upon general agreement, and theAmerican delegation has made it plain that President Hoover&apos;sproposals are put forward as a contribution to an agreed general programme. The United Kingdom Government have alreadyadvanced wide suggestions of their own. These, while they differ insome important respects as to method or measure, are inspired by thesame &quot;purpose, and a comparison will show that already there is asubstantial area of common ground.Without interrupting or anticipating detailed discussions whichmust take place with the other delegations represented at Geneva, &quot;itis convenient at this moment to set out in broad outline the maincharacteristics of the United Kingdom proposals. They in their turnshould be regarded, as I have said, not as a declaration of isolatedaction, but as a contribution to general agreement.2. First, the Government of the United Kingdom desire to puton record their agreement with President Hoover on the furtherprinciple that the three problems of Military, Naval and Airisarmament are inter-connected. International agreement cannotbe attained without an adequate contribution from all three sources.Inasmuch as Britain, like the United States, finds her strongest armin the navy, the contribution which concerns her most is to be foundin this sphere, in which, as is well known, contributions to disarmament on the largest scale have already been made in advanceof the General Disarmament Conference. Nevertheless, the Govern-ment of the United Kingdom now offer a further contribution as partof a general world settlement.

M      &apos;..!r.&apos;*..-     ..&apos; iii&apos;.,,.Land Proposals.4.   In the realm of land disarmament His Majesty&apos;s Goveinmetiivtlie United Kingdom find themselves very largely in accord withal-JiiriVfenamvf President Hoover&apos;s proposals.    Naturally, it will Unecessary carefully to examine details before expressing a final opinigon their suitability to the situation in each country.,&apos; &apos; 5. To consider in turn the four categories to which these&apos;pp. P&quot;posals relate : .J;.,,(a) In regard to the strength of land armies,  His Majesty&apos;!.5 Government have consistently^ placed ... in the  forefront of trjei.,proposals for land disarmament the examination of measures for thfIreduction of effectives to the lowest level compatible with nations! Jsafety.   So far as their own forces are concerned, His Majesty1!&apos;Government have not only abolished conscription, but have alreadi&apos;M&apos;ected&apos; reductions to the minimum numbers required for the preset-;Ration of internal order and for the defence of their overseas posses!&apos; sipns and communications.   If we take account of the whole British I1 army, including not only British troops in Great Britain and hen,&apos;poibnies, but also those maintained in India, the personnel has&apos; ben Jreduced, as compared with the year before the War, from 259,000IH207,000, and this has been effected by the disbandment of 9 regiment&apos;of cavalry, 61 batteries and companies of artillery, 21 companies d!Pioyal Engineers, 21 battalions of infantry, and 6 battalions of Colonial&apos; &quot;filifl troopsiocally enrolled.. The, United States proposal for a division of land forces into iy. police &quot;component &quot; and a &quot;defence component&quot; will require very&quot;$beta! examination; but, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government in the^United Kingdom understand the implication of the suggested basis oi^calculation,&apos; the result will be to show that the British land forces.&apos;&apos;JVave already been reduced substantially below the number recognisei-to be necessary for the maintenance of internal order, without makii^&quot;&apos;&apos;4&apos;iiy allowance for the forces needed for the lines of communicatim&quot;jfafatween the United Kingdom and territories overseas,j &apos;; ; (8) In regard to chemical and bacteriological warfare, His Majesty&apos;!, &apos;;Gbverhment in the United Kingdom have already joined in rejectifi! I&apos; &quot;fheuseof these methods of warfare and therefore cordially welcomi Ithe United States proposals under this head.[&apos;&apos; (c)r&apos; Tri regard to land, guns, His Majesty&apos;s Government in tit f/^&quot;UnitedKingdom have proposed the abolition of all mobile guns (jfil^calibre -greater thanT55 mm. (6&apos;1 inches calibre).   Under this heal I\also  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government   in  the&apos; United  Kingdom -fiil E&apos; Vthemselves, therefore, in general agreement with the proposals of ft I&quot;United States Government, - : .   1   -
,,. a&apos;j(x5J)s fIJv;l5figRrditontanks;,,, His.. Majestyj s j jGa^ynmgi^ (v% fcjje UnitediKihgdowi i find) ithemselves .enitwelsbati pa. Mife JP^esidaiit,, Hoover,4pdesiring) jthe, m application;.-ipfi i pjs&amp;WipJGd t^attack ^^eqli^iy, ojjensi^eweapons should be prohibited. His Majesty&apos;s Government havealready advocated the abolition of all tanks above a weight of 20 tons which by their characteristics are especially suitable for offensiveemployment in battle. .-\Tanks of the lighter type cannot be regarded as. specificallyoffensive weapons. Their comparatively light armour andtheir reduced capacity for. crossing trenches render: them unsuitable. for the assault of -highly organised defences. ....Moreover, in a small voluntarily-enlisted army like, ourown they constitute an essential compensation for lack ofcumbers which it would be impossible to surrender. As faras this country is concerned, in view of its world-wide responsebilities, ally general prohibition would require an increase in ourpresent land forces in terms of man power, and thus, as a measureof disarmament, would tend to defeat its own ends. - :!6. It would be seen, therefore, that in the realm of landdisarmament the proposals of the United States Government, so ffaras they relate to matters which directly touch the land forces of, theUnited Kingdom, approximate very closely to those favoured by HisMajesty&apos;s Government; and that in the total of their effectives HisMajesty&apos;s Government have been able already to put into practicejameasure of disarmament which more than conforms to the standardsproposed by President Hoover. ,&apos;Naval Proposals. &apos;    !/.&apos;7. These proposals cover all types of vessel-capital ships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers and submarines. . ...      ...       JVIt is essential that proposals that are intended to be adopted bygeneral agreement should make due provision for varyingcircumstances. Having regard to the widely-scattered responsibilities of the British Navy, it is not practicable for us to cut down the. numberof naval units beyond a certain point. Occasions may arise when these responsibilities call for the presence of ships simultaneouslyjini parts of the world far removed, from one another. It is essentialto bear in mind in this -connection the very large reduction in thenumber of; ships of all categories which has already been effected.If a comparison is made with the year before the War it will be foundthat,, taking account of completed vessels of the United Kingdom andother members of the British Commonwealth possessing vessels of anyof the categories mentioned, capital ships have been reduced from69 to 15; cruisers from 108.to 52; destroyers from 285 to 147; and submarines from 74 to 52. Numerical reduction in the. British ;&apos;navy&quot;has, therefore, already been applied on a very large scale and, indeed,cruiser numbers: will require special consideration hereafter. &quot;But,though there is, for the reasons already pointed out, a limit&quot;&apos;,&apos;to
lVumeridait reduction^ it is perfectly possible; and 5n the highest, deghdesh-able;: ;to /adopt ra mode &apos;ob -treatment which &quot;jyilj ^secure by pthimeans; the- large diminution in-naval armaments at which I we are/]aiming. : The ipresdnt Treaty limits of s.ize: and gun!calibre are far^high, and the United Kingdom Government consider that very Ianreductions, amounting to about one-third, both in the case of capitiships and cruisers, can be made in future construction.r&apos; 8:   As regards capital ships, the position under existing Navitreaties is that as between Britain, the United States and Japanno further capital ship construction could be undertaken in any evenuntil the year 1937.   The maximum size for any future construct^has been fixed at 35,000 tons and the gun at 16 inches.    The totjtonnage of the category of ships can be reduced either by diminishiiytheir number or by diminishing their size.  In regard to number, fJiconsiderations which the United Kingdom Government are bound tigbear in mind have already been stated.   The American proposal wouldIleave the size of these enormously expensive vessels, and the calilnffof their guns untouched in any future construction of capital ship&amp;iEvery figure involved in these huge dimensions initial cost, upkeep, ipersonnel, ammunition, stores, docks would be maintained at tin&apos;highest level.   The United Kingdom proposal, while securing no less,reduction in total tonnage, evades these consequences by (1) reducing-the size of the gun;  and (2) reducing the size of the ship.  Toilexample, if the calibre of the gun is reduced to 12 inches the maximum;size of the ship can be reduced from 35,000 to 25,000 tons,\and an immense saving is effected under both heads, both initially midconsequentially.9. But the Government of the United Kingdom are prepared to Igo beyond this. They are ready to apply the same principles tocruisers, and to reduce their maximum size and gun-calibre by inter-national agreement from the present figure of 10,000 tons and 8 inches,tq 7,000 tons and 61 inches. It would then be possible to reduce thedimensions in the case of capital ships still further and fix a maximum of ,22,000 tons with 11-inch guns. This will nearly halve the initial coslof&apos;,, any future capital ship and greatly reduce the cost of maintenance,Thus the whole scale would come down together and there would be adefinite return to smaller dimensions. On this basis the UnitedKingdom proposal would effect an ultimate reduction in capital-shiptonnage alone of 195,000 tons; the comparable figure under theUnited States proposal would appear to be about 175,000.,- 10. As. regards aircraft carriers, the Government of the UnitedKingdom, are in substantial agreement with President Hoover&apos;s pro-posals. They propose a reduction in the size of the Aircraft Carrierfrom 27,000 to 22,000 tons, with consequent reduction in total tonnagefrom 135,000 to 110,000 tons.11. Special reference must be made to the Submarine. The!United Kingdom view has been, and is, that the submarine should be

Consequently, the Government of the United Kingdom&apos; putforward for immediate adoption by international agreement ; thefollowing set of proposals relating to the navies of the world v      &apos; w o;(1) Eeduce the maximum size of any future capital ship to 22,000&apos; tons.  and the maximum calibre of the guns carried to11 inches.(2) Eeduce the maximum size of cruisers hereafter constructed; to7,000 tons, and maximum calibre of guns to 6&quot;1 inches.(3) If international agreement on point (2) cannot be secured, theGovernment of the United Kingdom would still urge thatthe maximum size of capital ships should be reduced!.to25,000 tons and their guns to 12 inches as a maximum. &quot;(4) Eeduce the maxima for aircraft carriers to 22,000 tons with6&quot;l-inch guns. &apos;]]?\(5) Abolish submarines. &apos;(6) Eeduce destroyer tonnage by approximately one-third, thisdepending on the abolition of submarines.(7) If submarines cannot be completely abolished, fix their maximum surface displacement at 250 tons, with a iStilctlimitation both of total tonnage and number of units.,Air Proposals.13. There is no aspect of international disarmament more vitallyurgent than the adoption without del a y of the most effective meastiresto preserve the civilian population from the fearful horrors61bombardment from the air. The Government of the United Kingdoinwould be prepared to go to any length, in agreement with bth&amp;rPowers, to achieve this object, and if more drastic measures- &quot;are proposed from any other quarter and are shown to be practicable, theywill examine them with the utmost sympathy. &quot;&apos;&apos;!&apos;They propose that the Higli Contracting Parties should agreebetween themselves in respect of their air forces that thereshould be &apos;&quot; &quot;      :&apos;-&apos;H;](1) the complete prohibition of all bombing from the air,, savewithin limits to be laid down as precisely as possible by aninternational convention. Attacks upon the civilian pqpula-tion would be entirely prohibited; &apos; 1     -iiwoq(2) a strict limitation in the unladen weight of all military ahflnaval aircraft (troop carriers and flying boats excepted);&quot;(3) a restriction in the numbers of all kinds of military and naval aircraft. j
14. In this last connecti? ? United Kingdom Government ? to add an observation they ? to see numbers ?military and naval ? again regard must ? had to the course of ? events ? air armaments ? negligible, and no comparison with that date can usefully be mad?

At the end of the War, Great Britain was one of the two leading ? Powers in the World. Her colonial possessions are widely scatte? and since the War her responsibilities have been increased by ? various mandates from the League of Nations. More than any ? Power she relies upon aircraft to discharge her mandatory duties ? aircraft had been reduced to little more than 20 per cent, of her ? war strength, with the result that the United Kingdom now stands, ? the number of its military and naval aeroplanes, only fifth in the list ? States. Of aircraft authorised for Home Defence in 1923 by the Unite? Kingdom Government, with the approval of Parliament, 20 per cen? have not, in fact, been constructed.

15. Great and far-reaching as these reductions in all three an? have been-beyond comparison greater than any which have been effected elsewhere outside the countries disarmed by the Treaty ? Versailles - His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom ? ready and eager to join the further measures of disarmament ? which general agreement can be attained.
