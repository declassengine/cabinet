0T9AWA 1, The Prime Minister informed the CabinetCONFERENCE.that he had received a communication from the(Previous from OttawaReference: Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs/callingCabinet 44(32). Con- attention to the following Addendum that had beenelusion 4,)issued to Cabinet Conclusion 44 (32), 4:-The point was raised that any arrangement with the Dominionswhich was for a period of years,and which would place Parliamentunder any obligation to maintainparticular rates of duty for aparticular time, would be opento objection on Constitutionalgrounds, and that whatever agree-ment was reached ought not to prejudice the possibility ofarrangements with foreign countries for tariff reductions.I The Secretary of State for Dominion Affaxrs had asked, in the name of the Ministers at Ottawa,that a passage to the following effect might beplaced on the records of the Cabinet;-The Cabinet   are reminded that section VII of the Finance Act of1926 provides &quot;that during aperiod of ten years from the 1stof July, 1926, the preferencegiven to Empire products shallbe stabilised at the amountgiven on that day, or that, If thegeneral Customs duty shall in anycase be reduced to a figure equalto or below the amount of thepreference, Empire goods shallbe admitted free of duty altogether&quot;:alsothat a statement of policy made onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom at the ImperialConference of 1930, included thefollowing passage&quot;In the meantime His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United kingdom have declared that the existing preferential margins accorded bythe United Kingdom to other partsof the Empire will not be reducedfor a period of three years orpending the outcome of the suggestedConference, subject to the rightsof the.United Kingdom Parliament to fix the budget from year to ye^r&quot; .mhe Cabinet took note of the above.
JWIT ED STATESP AMERICA.Opening of new buildings ofthe Supreme &apos;Court atWashingt on.2, The Prime Minister brought to the attentionof the Cabinet a personal message he had receivedfrom the Lord President of the Council, at Ottawa.Mr Baldwin understood from Mr Bennett, the PrimeMinister of Canada, that the Government of the UnitedStates had suggested that the United Kingdom shouldbe represented by the Lord Chancellor, or, failinghim, by the Secretary of State for War, at the openingon the 12th October of the new buildings of theSupreme Court at Washington.   Mr Baldwin had addedthat if the Prime Minister thought it desirable inall the circumstances that the United Kingdom shouldbe represented by the Lord Chancellor or Lord Hailsham,and if for any reason the Lord Chancellor found itimpossible to leave England in October, Lord Hailsham.would, though with great reluctance, be prepared togo to Washington.    Lord Hailsham, however, had no desire to go, and would only do so if the. only alterna-tive was that the United Kingdom would be unrepresentedon this important occasion. Mr Baldwin had been givento understand that in any event the United StatesGovernment did not wish the United. Kingdom to berepresented by someone who had previously spoken inthe United States.The Lord Chancellor stated that it was impossiblefor him to attend the Washington ceremony, and therewas general agreement that in any event his presence in London would be most important in connection withthe consideration by the Cabinet of questions affectingthe Indian Constitution.The Prime Minister invited the Lord chancellor to deal with the question.Uig-
1 &quot;M3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that, while there were many matters of grave importance in the field of Foreign Policy,in view of the heavy Agenda Paper he did not feel justified in troubling the Cabinet with them, except those matters which were already on the Agenda Paper.
REDUCTION AND 4. The Cabinet had before them the followingLIMITATION OFARMAMENTS. documents relating to the Disarmament conference a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-270(32)) covering a Resolution adoptedby the General Commission of theDisarmament Conference on July 23,1932 (Annex I) and a declaration made in the name of the GermanGovernment by Herr Nadolny atGeneva on July 22, 1932, indicatingGermanyTs resolve to bring to thefront her claim for &quot;equality oftreatment&quot;.   The Secretary ofState&apos;s covering Memorandum con-tained the suggestion that theDepartments concerned should be instructed to examine the proposals in the Resolution with which theyare concerned and to put forwardconstructive siiggestions, not later than the 5th September, asto how these proposals should be implemented.   The proposals might then be considered as a whole bythe Cabinet Disarmament Sub-Committee, who would report upon them to the Cabinet.   The object would be to have a more definite policy for our Delegation whendiscussions at the Bureau arere-opened.   It was suggested alsothat the views of Japan, Franceand Italy on the British proposals and their intentions as regards theAmerican proposals.should beconfidentially ascertained:A Note by the Secretary of Statefor Air (CP.-272 (32)) on AirDisarmament Policy, urging theCabinet to reaffirm the policyadvocated in the Declaration ofBritish Disarmament Policy( md,4122), which he summed upas follows:-(i) Complete prohibition of allbombing from the air, savewithin limits to be laid downas precisely as possible byan International Convention.(ii) Entire prohibition of all air attack upon the civil popula-tion,(iii) A strict limitation in theunladen weight of all militaryand naval aircraft (troopcarriers and flying boatsexcepted) .(iv) A restriction in the numbersof all kinds of military and naval aircraft.The Disarmament^conference.&quot;&quot;Air Bombing.(previous reference:Cabinet 43(32), Con-clusion 1 and appendix III.)T
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in the course of a statement in amplification ofhis Memorandum, informed the Cabinet that theUnited States Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires had that morningexpressed his personal opinion that it would be unwise at the present time to arrange formalconversations on the Naval issues raised by theDisarmament Resolutions.   This confirmed theSecretary of State&apos;s view that it would be better to resort to a less formal procedure.In this connection the First Lord of theAdmiralty suggested that it would be unwise toconvenejany formal meeting for the discussion ofthe Naval issues until after the American Elections .1The Cabinet were reminded that this would post-pone such discussions until after November 5th,although the Bureau of the^&amp;efrgae-of Nationo was tomeet on September 21st.The attention of the Cabinet was then called tothe strong propaganda that was being conducted bythe League of Nations Union and in certain organs ofthe Press in favour of President Hoover*s proposals.The only counter to this propaganda that had hitherto been undertaken was contained in the Declaration ofBritish Disarmament Policy (Cmd.4122) made in theHouse of Commons by the Lord President of the Council,and the speeches of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs at Geneva.    In spite of this, however, the propaganda continued.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out thatit would be       ^  easy to counter the propagandaif the Cabinet thought fit, and he read to the Cabinetthe following passages from a note he had before him as appropriate for this purpose:-
The chief functions of our Navy are to -(l) Ensure the safe arrival of imports to these islands;(2) Ensure security to our sea commu-nications all over the world.For both these purposes thenumbers of our ships are moreimportant to us than their size.For (I) a large number of cruisers,purely for defensive purposes, isnecessary and can be of small size and lightly armed if others will agree.For (2) a battle fleet composedof much smaller ships, and armed witha much smaller gun than advocated byMr Hoover, and consisting of a totalnumber sufficient to allow an adequatenumber to be despatched to the seat of war while retaining at home anadequate number for home defence.The 10 Capital Ships and 30Cruisers that would remain to theU.S.A. and British Empire under theHoover proposals, while being morethan ample for the purposes of theU.S.A., would render our Navy incapable of guaranteeing the security of theBritish Empire or the arrival of thefood upon which this country depends.Under the Hoover proposals, the sacrifice of the British Empire, inaddition to that already acceptedunder the London Naval Treaty, is approximately double of that requiredby the U.S.A., for the British Empirewould have to scrap 289,576 tons andthe U.S.A. only 149,600 tons.Under the Hoover proposals, theBritish Empire would be called uponto scrap 74,625 tons of its Inadequatecruiser tonnage, while the U.S.A.could build 33,750 tonsThe First Lord added that if counter propaganda wasto be attempted it would be more effective ifundertaken by the Prime Minister or colleagues otherthan from the interested Departments.The Prime Minister, however, felt that on thewhole it would be better to allow the propagandanow being undertaken by the League of Nations union to work itself out and not to enter oh a controversyat the present stage.
In this connection it was suggested thatpropaganda calculated to weaken Naval security wasnot likely to make any permanent appeal to theEritish people.The Secretary of State for India raised as amatter of urgency the question of the precise meaning of the Air Disarmament Resolution of the Council.A week or two before he had received information that one branch of the Mohmand tribe on the North-West Frontier of India was about to attack another.The Government of India had felt some doubts., in viewof the Resolution, as to whether they could apply the usual methods of Air Force action to preserve the peace.   After consultation with the Secretaryof State for Air and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs he himself had come to the conclusionthat our support to the Resolution had not impliedany intention to restrict our usual methods .   Ee was anxious, however, to receive the support of theCabinet to this view.    If there was any doubt on thesubject he pointed out that the Royal Air force would lose its usefulness for preserving the peace inIndia and the Middle East.In this connection the Cabinet were reminded that the Air Force was not used to bomb the civilian population.   When bombing operations were to beundertaken, previous notice was invariably given tothe civil population, in time to enable them to make their escape from the threatened locality.After the Delegates who had taken part in thediscussions at Geneva had stated that no obection had ever been taken at Geneva to our method ofutilising air forces for the maintenance of order,.. -7-
the Cabinet accepted the view that the GenevaI Resolutions must not be interpreted as involvingany departure from, or restriction on, those methods.The Cabinet were warned, however, that there might be difficulties in the future if the resolution was adopted in its present form, and that questionsmight be raised if civilians did lose their livesin such operations .The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the line taken by theUnited Kingdom Delegation at theDisarmament Conference at Geneva,as set forth in the Note by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs (C.P.-270 (32)):(b) That the three Defence departments should examine and advise as to theResolutions of the DisarmamentConference, in a constructivespirit, as to how far and in what manner they can best be implemented,and should forward their reports to the Cabinet Office not later than September 5th:(c) That on receipt of the Reports ofthe Defence Departments the CabinetCommittee on Disarmament should meetfor the purpose of preparing recom-mendations to the Cabinet;(The Prime Minister undertook to consider whether, in presentcircumstances,&quot; the CabinetCommittee might be re-constitutedwith a smaller membership.)Naval Armaments. (d) That no initiative,:should be takenby His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom in arranging for ameeting of the five principal naval powers, at any rate until after the presidential Flection in the UnitedStates of America on November 5th,and that if any such meeting was totake place it might be more&quot;appropriate for the League of Nations to summon it:ve) That opportunity should be found,by arrangement between the admiralty and the Foreign Office, for ascertain-ing the views of Japan, France andItaly on the British and american proposals for Naval Disarmament:
(f) That the Admiralty, keeping intouch with the Foreign Office,should also discuss the questionof Naval Disarmament with theUnited States Naval Attache&quot;,reminding him of the negotiationsof the London Naval Conference of1930 and of the carefully adjustedbalance of naval strength thenarrived at;    enquiring in whatrespects the American naval views had changed;    and inviting theAttache1 to start from that positionand explain the recent changes inthe American attitude:(g) That the Admiralty should prepare a full statement of the british attitude towards the Hoover pro-posals and Naval Disarmamentgenerally:Air Forces - (h) That the Resolution adopted by theUse for General Commission of the DisarmamentMaintenance Conference on Air Forces did not of Order. involve any change in the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government as to theuse of air forces for policepurposes in India and in Britishand Mandated Territories, since thepractice is to give sufficient notice to enable the civilian population towithdraw before bombs are dropped onany particular locality.
I THE OTTAWA* CONFERENCE.appreciation of presentPosition.(previous reference:Cabinet 44(32), Con-clusion 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (acting for the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs) (0.P.-277 (32)) cireu-lating for the information of his colleagues an appreciation of the position so far reached at the ottawa Conference, which had been received from theUnited Kingdom Delegation.The Prime Minister said that the above apprecia-tion had been sent at his request.   No issue, however,was raised requiring a decision by the Cabinet.The Cabinet took note of C.P.-277 (32).
4/ 4*Ihe lausanne conference.Jnsequent ialTangements .The WorldfEconomic andfinancialiGonfereriQe.I( previous Reference:Cabinet 44(32), Con-clusion 1.)f-B,.6. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary to the Cabinet, in his capacity as secretary-General to the Lausanne Conference(CP.-265 (32)) setting forth the arrangements for setting up the various Committees mentioned in theFinal Act of the Lausanne Conference and the instruments appended to it (Cmd. 4126).    In this note stress was laid more particularly on the world economic and Financial Conference and the preparatory committee to be set up in connection therewith.In the last paragraph of the Note the following questions still requiring decision were set forth:-(1) The place where the World conference is to meet, and the date.(2) The place-where the preparatory committee is to meet .(3) The date for the preparatory committee,and(4) Its Chairmanship.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs mentioned that the Secretary&apos;s Mote was no longerquite up to date, as a few developments had takenplace since it was written.   He referred to thedifficulty with which the League of NationsOrganising Committee would be confronted in deciding what countries were to be invited to the Conference.The Cabinet were informed that the following steps had been taken in this country to prepare for the World Economic and Financial Conference:-(i) An Inter-Departmental Committeehad been set up, with the permanent secretary to the Treasury in the chair, which included representativesof the Treasury, Foreign Office,Dominions Office, Colonial Office,India Office, Board of Trade,Scottish Office, the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries, and theDepartment of Overseas Trade:
(ii) A Committee of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil, set up by the Prime Ministerto advise him as to the points to which british policy should be speciallydirected.    (See following conclusion.)The Cabinet agreed  (a) That if the Organising Committee ofthe League of Nations desired thatthe World Economic and financial conference should take place inLondon, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto state that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom would be preparedto accept the proposal and to give every possible facility and assistanceto make the Conference a success:(b) That as regards the date there wasa good deal to be said for November,after the American Elections:(c) That as regards the meeting-place ofthe Preparatory Committee for theWorld Economic and Financial Conferencethere was much to be said for geneva and for inviting the League of nations to undertake the Secretarial arrange-ments;    that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, the Secretary tothe Cabinet, the Treasury and the Boardof Trade should keep in touch on thequestions raised in the Secretary&apos;note;    and that the decision as tothe place and date should be left tothe Prime Minister.
7.    The Prime Minister availed himself of theopportunity of the mention of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil in the discussion recorded in the previousMinute to make a short statement to the Cabinet asto the functions of that body, which had been setup before the present Government came into existence.He said that its object was to advise the PrimeMinister, and that it had been modelled, Mutatis Mutandis, on the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Council met to consider such questions as were referred to it, and sent their Reports to thePrime Minister.    If he thought them of sufficient importance, the Prime Minister circulated them tothe Cabinet.    The questions raised at the present day were so varied that the Prime Minister had found it of the first importance to be able toobtain suggestions from experts not necessarilyconfined to the Government Service, although, ofcourse, those suggestions did not supersede theadvice of the Government Departments .
INDIA.[.ne CommunalDecision,(previous reference:Cabinet 38(32), Con-clusion 1.)8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (CP.-266 (32))covering a draft statement relating to the Communaldecision in India.The Secretary of State for India emphasised theexhaustive nature of the investigations which had led up to the preparation of the draft Statement,There had been a continuous flow of Memoranda andtelegrams, and every figure in the document hadbeen subjected to the closest scrutiny, whether byGovernors of .      n ,     ., ^the/Indian Provinces, the Indian Government, the india Office, or the Cabinet Committee.    If thequestion were raised as to why the Government hadbeen drawn into this complicated meticuloxis calcula-tion, the result of which would perhaps please fewand irritate many, the reason was that without adecision on the Communal question no progress couldbe made in the Constitutional field in India, andour best friends in India would become our opponents.Unpleasant and unpopular as any decision must be,it was unavoidable to proceed with it.To the uninitiated it might seem absurd to allotbeforehand every seat in India.   This, however, wasno new proposal.   The practice of separate electorateshad now stood for nearly a generation, and nodeparture from it was practicable.    India was sotied to the system of separate electorates that theGovernment had been compelled to examine every seatin great, detail and to make proposals as to how itshould be filled.The draft Communal decision was confined to theProvincial Assemblies.   The Federal Assembly had notbeen touched.   The difficulties at-the centre werenot so great as in the Provinces, but further^enquiry-14-
was&quot;needed on certain points before a settlement could be reached.The main difficulties, the Secretary of Statepointed out, arose in connection with Bengal, the punjab and the Depressed Classes.mj^e ^Depressed Classes.    This question had become urgent in recent years, during which theDepressed Classes had developed political conscious-ness.   The basis of the present plan was not to separate the Depressed Classes,from the mass of the hindu communities.   The Parliamentary Under-Secretary,who had studied this question very closely, had urgedthat the rank and file of the Depressed Classesregarded themselves as part of the Hindu community and that it was inadvisable to take the extreme viewof some of the leaders that they should be treatedas a separate class.    Consequently it was proposedto enfranchise the Depressed Classes to the extentof 10 per cent, of their population in .the different parts of India;    that is to say, their vote wouldbe exercised within the Hindu electorate.    It was]ofe$o       7] felt, however, that, in addition, they must havefL Aff)/iii.(UeJ(L     some separate representation, and consequently theyn      i \ an aggregate of about-/jJiad been givenjj^-^e^se iHftho 10 olootorates.By this plan it was sought to avoid, segregating theDepressed Classes from the Hindus, while enabling them to exercise their influence and to have a chance of gradually breaking down the barrier of&quot;untouchability&quot;.Bengal.    A variety of proposals had beensubmitted as to the Bengal electorate.   The planset forth in the Statement provided for the europeans, with 10 per- cent, of the seats, to hold the balance between the Mohammedans and the Hindus.-15-
f -1 7,r\ The reason why the Mohammedans had not been giventhe full benefit of their majority in the populationwas partly that they were/lops oduoatod, and partlythat &quot;eKeTHn^u^wouTZ^Pe^l safer if the Fait ope ansheld the balance.   After the exclusion of theEuropean seats the seats for Moslems and Hindus wereallotted broadly on a population basis .The Punjab.    In the Punjab the difficulty was with the Sikhs, who comprised 13 per cent, of thepopulation.    The Sikhs, as the race who had formerlyruled the Punjab, maintained that they ought to begiven an exceptional position, and demanded up tofrom 30 to 50 per- cent, of the seats.   After carefulconsideration it had been decided to accept therecommendation of the G-overnment of India and togive them 18.9 per cent, of the seats.    It wasimpossible to entertain their extreme demands.The Mohammedans were not given a majority of territorial seats.    In order to obtain a majoritythey would have to win some of the other seats .In practice, however, they ought to obtain a  u*M&amp;^**-majority of 2 over all other Parties .Among smaller difficulties the Secretary ofState referred to that presented by the women&apos;sseats, which it had been decided, somewhat reluctant-ly, to allot on a Communal basis;   that is to say,some for Moslems and others for Hindus.    otherwise the result would be that all the women&apos;s seats would go to Hindus.The Constitutional Programme,   The Secretary ofState then made a statement on the Constitutionalprogramme.   He recalled that his last statement . -in the House of Commons had been approved by theGovernment of India, and the Viceroy had then  eifc-16-
1 9 9e^j* iete*%* that the Hindu Liberals would be reconciledto the programme.   There had consequently been muchdisappointment when Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru andMr Jayakar resigned as a protest against theprocedure.   He had since received communications from other Indians, many of whom liked the procedure,but Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru had taken a line againstthe proposals .   All were most anxious to obtain hisco-operation, though it was impossible to departfrom the main outline of the Secretary of State&apos;sstatement in the House of Commons.    It would beimpossible to revert to the large meetings of the round-Table Conference,    The objections were partlypersona^, partly due to the fact that a stage had now been reached when it was necessary to concentrate on particular points,   and   partly   to    the attitudeof Parliament, which would object to the existenceof something that might be described as a Constitu-tional Assembly overlapping with the Parliamentarystages of the question.   Consequently it was proposedto invite the Viceroy to get in touch with thedissidents, to put the objections to the course theyadvocated, to g-e-aa-M-th-e-oe-edur-c -erg-i 1 ic d-ast b-we-jH&amp;a^as, and at the same time to make it clear thatthe co-operation of Indians was desired not only in, .fthe Committee Stage but wfe.il e the Govornmont woe&amp;ra- t-3.ng -the-42441,    For these latter stages it wasCu-fu^L   t-j7&apos;proposed that/afeoufe 20 Indians should be invited toLondon to discuss a definite Agenda late in the &apos;UlZAutumn.   The reasons for postponing their arrivalwere, first, that it was hoped that the Cabinet inthe early Autumn would make up its mind on a numberof specific points;    second, that it would beimpossible to set up the Joint Committee until-17-
1 91 a*towards the end of the year,  or ge^fea^ early inthe New Year;    and it would be a mistake to bringthe Indians here early in the Autumn, allowing themto return to India and become involved in discussion?before the proposals were launched.    Such a coursewould result in the proposals being subjected tosevere opposition^in India^.    It was preferred tobring the Indian representatives here later and tomerge one stage of the procedure into the next.As regards the Consultative Committee it was not proposed to dissolve it but to keep it in being incase it might^usefully be summoned.It was felt to be essential to know more aboutthe attitude of the Princes before the proposals were finally drafted.    Consequently it was proposed to invite the Viceroy to meet the Princes towards theend of August, to get as far with them as he could,and to report to the Secretary of State what hopesthere were of success.The Cabinet expressed their warm appreciation ofthe labours of the Secretary of State for India inthis matter, and approved both the draft statement relating to the Communal decision in India (CP.-266(32)) and the method of procedure outlined above.
9.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister of Labour (CP ,-267 (32)) covering aMemorandum by the Minister in charge of the export credits Guarantee Department on the subject ofTrade with Russia.

The Englishscheme in the Carlisle district, and the Scottishscheme in the Gretna and CromaFsty Pirth districts,were worked in close association one with another,with a single Central Advisory Committee.    In connec-tion with arrangements for the retirement of theStaff it was stated that, notwithstanding that itwas not composed of established Civil Servants, theTreasury were prepared to agree, in the specialc ire-urns tances of the case, that the provisions ofthe law could adequately be met if they were assured that the State Management Schemes would not be terminated during the life of the present Government.The English Royal Commission on Licensing had, by amajority, expressed themselves in favour of maintain-ing the Carlisle undertaking, but the Scottish RoyalCommission had recommended that the State Managementexperiment should be discontinued in the Gretna andCromarty districts.   The investigation by theScottish Royal Commission, however, was stated tohave been of rather a cursory nature, and theSecretary of State for Scotland was reported to benot disposed to attach much importance to theirfinding.   Discontinuance of either the English orScottish undertakings would require legislation.
The authors of the Memorandum did not favour such legislation, and asked their colleagues to agreethat the necessary assurance that the schemes willremain in force during the life of the present government should be given to the Treasury in orderthat suitable provision might be made for the award of pensions on the scale prescribed for establishedCivil Servants .The Cabinet approved the recommends-tion of the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland thatan assurance should be given to theTreasury that the schemes for StateManagement should remain in force during the life of the present government..

It was not practicable for Scotland to adopt a different system from england in this matter, since, under the proposals of thePresident of the Board of Education, Scotland would lose  27,000 per annum and obtain no relief without legislation.With the consent of the President of the Boardof Education, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone the question until thereturn of the Chancellor of theExchequer from Ottawa:(b) That the subject should be placed onthe Agenda Paper for the first Meetingafter the return of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.
