The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that theLabour Government had agreed to defray all the expensesof a simple tablet to be set up In Westminster Abbeyin memory of the late Lord Oxford and Asquith.Various difficulties had arisen in carrying out thework, but he had learnt that morning that these had nowbeen surmounted.      The expense was small.The Cabinet agreed to the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal that they should confirm the decision of the labour government to defray the cost of the proposed tablet,and they authorised the Prime Minister to write, onbehalf of the Government, to the appropriate authoritiesconveying this decision, and expressing the hope that thematter would at once be proceeded with.

NDON 3.     Arising out of the consideration given to theSSENGERlANSPORT question of the date of the Prorogation of Parliament,ILL.I... referred to in the previous Minute, a short discussionireviousInference. took place as to the prospects of passing in both Housestbinet 52(32),gnclusion 5).    of Parliament&apos;the resulution carrying over the london passenger Transport Bill.      It was pointed out that ifthe resolution was rejected in either House the result would be very serious, since a fresh Bill would have tobe introduced in the new Parliament, and the procedure in passing a hybrid Bill would cause very serious delays.Little doubt was felt that the opposition in theHouse of Commons, though active, would not result In the defeat of the resolution.     The prospects in the Houseof Lords, it was suggested, would depend to some extent on the character of the opposition in the House ofCommons.The suggestion was made to the Secretary of Statefor War, as Leader of the House ol Lords, that he should endeavour to secure the active support of the RailwayCompanies by any suitable means,.such as,for example,the participation of some of their Directors in the Debate,and       the issue of circulars to shareholders, who were also members of the House of Lards, explaining the greatimportance of the resolution and of the Bill to railwayinterests.

TheMinister was asked to send copiesto the Prime Minister and the lord president of the Council before the afternoon of Tuesday next, November1st, when those two Ministers, withthe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, were to receive a Deputa-tion:
(o) That the negotiations of the Boardof Trade with the Australian and NewZealand Meat-Packers should not &quot;beheld up in the meanwhile;(d) That the Inter-Departmental negotia-tions on the subject of the BaconIndustry should continue:(. e) That if the Government were, asked inParliament for their views on theReport of the Lane-Pox Commission,the reply should be to the effectthat the matter required very carefulconsideration and that when theGovernment&apos;s decision had been reachedan announcement would be made.
V     eiMALTA.he Languageuestion.previous reference:Cabinet 51(32), Con-elusion 3.)F.JV.9 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-352(52))  on the subject of the Language Question in malta, on whichlhe had to answer a Question in theHouse of Commons the same day.   The Memorandumrecalled that the Letters-Patent laid down that infuture English and Maltese should be the onlylanguages to be taught in the elementary schools in malta.   After the recent election, which had resultedin the return of the Nationalist Party, ministers had set to work to see how they could get round thelaw on the language question, and instructions hadbeen issued to the teachers in Malta that so-called&quot;voluntary&quot; classes were to be introduced in allelementary schools for teaching Italian to children of all ages.   The Governor had informed the MalteseMinisters that this was clearly contrary to thespirit of the law, whatever might be the strict legalinterpretation.   The Secretary of State, however, was advised by the Law Officers that the action of the maltese Ministers was not only clearly contrary tothe spirit of the law but was also in fact a breach of the Letters-Patent,   He therefore proposed to instruct the Governor accordingly and to give an answer in the House of Commons in this sense.    Itwas probable that the Maltese Ministers would refuseto comply with the law, and in that case the Secretaryof State thought the only effective course would beto tell them that if they do not carry out the lawthe control of education would be taken out of their hands and education would be made a reserved serviceuntil such time as they were willing to comply withthe law.   He had no doubt that this was the right course, although it might involve legal difficulties.-12-
The Law Officers had advised him that he could only make education a reserved service if he was satisfiedthat the course proposed was necessitated by a &quot;grave emergency&quot; within the meaning, of the Letters-Patent.He was so satisfied, and proposed to proceed accordinglyif the Maltese Ministers proved obdtirate.   This action would probably be&quot;challenged in the Malta Courts,and if the decision was unfavourable it would benecessary to regularise the position by a short Billin Parliament here.   He understood from the foreign secretary, however, that it would be desirable, havingregard to the international situation, if possibleto postpone action for a short time.    He therefore proposed to try to get the Question postponed and tocommunicate to the Governor the decision of the Cabinet,but to tell him to take no action thereon until he received further instructions.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that he had succeeded in securing the postponement of the Parliamentary Question that hadbeen put down on this subject.   While quite willingto meet the wTishes of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs for a short postponement, he pointedout that action could not be delayed for more than aweek or ten days without the risk of a situation arising in Malta, owing to the actual establishmentof the Italian classes, which would render- the Govern-m.entTs policy difficult to carry out.The suggestion was made that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should inform Signor Mussoliniin advance of the action which it wras proposed to take,and of the reasons.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for the Colonies,as set forth above, subject to his agreement with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs as to the date onwhich the policy should be put inoperation:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for theColonies, should arrange that a communication should be made at once to Signer Mussolini notifying theaction which it was proposed to take,and explaining that it was not aimed at Italian cultural developments in malta, but that it was necessary inorder to maintain the Constitutionof the Island:(c) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should inform the governor of the policy that was to be adopted,but should instruct him to suspendaction until he received further instructions.
10. The Cabinet had before them the Report of an inter-Departmental Committee appointed to considerthe recommendations contained in the Report of thePishing Indue try Committee of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil &apos;C,P.-384 (32)), which the Cabinet, at theMeeting referred to in the margin, had instructed,the Secretary to keep on the Agenda Paper.The Cabinet were informed that the Report was still under consideration by the Minister of Agricul-ture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State forScotland.The President of the Board of Trade asked thatwhen certain questions contained in the Report, which affected the Mercantile Marine, were under considera-tion, the Board of Trade might be consulted.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That consideration of the report should be postponed until theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary ofState for Scotland were ready todiscuss it, and that until then the subject should be removed, fromthe Agenda Paper of the Cabinet:(b) That the above Ministers should consult the Board of Trade on questions affecting the MercantileMarine
