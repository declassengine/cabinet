TTAWA 1. The Cabinet had before-them a  ;telegram-fromNCE.the -United-kingdom--Deie gat ion at-Ottawa, circulatedi-ous(^jnce:        by., the -Secretary -of Sfaire r&apos;or Dominion Affairs-net 45Con- (N. 377 (-58))-, containing-particulars of the variousion lo)Agreements concluded at Ottawa,cedure After the Prime Minister had welcomed the Ministersotiations   w&apos;tl0 ^ad Jus ^ returned from Ottawa,  the three Delegates madestatements as to the proceedings of the Conference.other The Lord President of the Council said that he didtries.FAnot wish to add much to the general statement issued by the delegates on their arrival and published in full in themore important newspapers of even date.       Prom the first^tfjtyj&apos;        ^tle Delegation had appreciated the risks of failure at ottawa, the difficulties that it would create at the world conference and the diminution of British influence that must result.    . One difficulty arose from the fact that each-Dominion had to negotiate with the United kingdom delegation, but the United Kingdom Delegation had tonegotiate with all.      The Delegates had therefore to passcontinuously from one negotiation to another.      the delegation had held more than 70 meetings - an average ofmore than two a day.     He paid a tribute to the harmony oftheir proceedings.      The Delegation had worked as one man.Every question had been discussed on its merits, andunanimity had prevailed throughout.The Lord President then discussed briefly theattitude of the other Delegations, making special mention of the helpfulness of the Indian Delegates, and the goodteam work of the South African Delegates, who had been most helpful throughout and were prepared on their returnto South Africa to denounce their Treaty with Germany.
The position of the Irish pree State Delegation had-&quot;been peculiar.They had learned a lot about the position of a Dominionwithin the British Commonwealth, and he believed they felt a genuine, regret at their inability to play any effective part,and that they had gone home with a desire to do so in thefuture, though this depended on the difficult personalityof Mr. de Valera.     The Canadian Delegation had been handi-capped by the activities of elements in the Dominion, acting under the pull of American interests, that desired thefailure of the Conference.The Agreement with India, the Lord President explained,could not be published at present as the Indian delegates had advised that this would jeopardise its passage through theLegislative Assembly, but it was^ a very satisfactory instrument.Speaking generally the Delegation had achieved itsmajor objects - an increase in the preference to the UnitedKingdom, coupled with a lowering of tariff   duties.     Theyhad worked consistently for an alteration in the high protectivepolicy of the Dominions.      In the case of Australia recent events, had worked in this direction.     The effects of thepolicy of economic isolation adopted by Australia had beenbrought home by recent experience. Declarations ofpolicy had been obtained from both Canada and Australia re-ducing duties and giving the United Kingdom producers anopportunity for reasonable competition in domestic markets,due allovreince being made for the relative cost of economicaland efficient production.     Much depended on the way in whichthe agreements were implemented.      In order to build on the foundations laid statesmanship and continuous contact wouldbe required.The Lord President then described some of thedifficulties that had arisen, more particularly with canada and Australia, which had rendered success doubtful up to the
very eve of the termination of the Conference,     That someresolutions of a general character had been&apos;passed at the finalmeeting was clue to the skill of the Chancellor of the Exchequer?to which he paid a high tribute.The substantial result of the Conference, the lord president added, was the declaration of policy referred to above,which should do good, not in the Commonwealth alone, but as an example to the world.      A breach had been made in the policy of high tariffs;      some Customs anomalies had been got rid of,  andit was hoped that more would disappear as the result of the Ottawa.Conference.     This ought to help the work of the World Conference,The Chancellor of the Exchequer, supplementing the lord president&apos;s statement, offered the sole criticism that he hadunderstated both the difficulties and the achievement.     he explained   the difficulties due to the personal equation of someDelegates and to Press attacks on the United Kingdom Delegation.  .He gave illustrations,including the problem created by thecompetition of Soviet Russia, which, though not fundamentallya subject of any great divergence of opinion, had been kept open, apparently as a bargaining factor, until near the end ofthe Conference.One point  that had struck the Chancellor was how thinthe bonds of Empire had worn, and the growth of nationalismin the Dominions.      He did not think that the bonds could havesurvived but for this Conference, which had strengthened the sense of belonging to a great Commonwealth and of the advantages,to be derived therefrom.     The unofficial contacts also had proved very advantageous and might produce useful developments   :,in the future.The Delegation had thought that it would be useful, asat Lausanne, to get. some guiding principles adopted at an early,stage of the Conference, and, on the outward voyage, had devoted
some time to drafting them.      Unfortunately, however,  they hadnot been ahle to obtain this.     Their aim had been to secure a lowering rather than a raising of   tariff, barriers.      some members of the Canadian Government, however, living under the shadow of a powerful neighbour given to sudden and ruthlessimposition of trade barriers, had evinced a strong oppositionto any such general policy and could not bear the thought oflowering their  &quot;tariff, barriers against the United States.Consequently the United Kingdom Delegation had been obliged toabandon the idea of passing resolutions at an  early stage,  andhad had to reserve them until the end of the Conference.      Itwas found that what we could offer to the Dominions was of. more immediate value than what they could give us, and the delgation had rather sought to set the tiller so as to steer the Dominionsinto the right course.      They had aimed at a special preferenceon articles not manufactured in the Dominions;    and on articlesthe Dominions did make to obtain a chance for us to compete.They could not expect the Dominions in a day to change their&quot;tariff    and put their manufacturers at the mercy of Britishcompetition, so they aimed at a progressive opportunity inreturn for a long-term agreement.      At first this was a new ideato- the Dominions, but eventually they took to it and the principle was embodied in the agreements.Another principle, the Chancellor oontinued, was the regulation of meat supply.      Before the Conference began,  thequestion of meat export was known to be of great importance toAustralia and New Zealand and of interest to Canada, where therewas a realisation that farming was too dependent on wheatproduction and that they should turn more towards  generalfarming.      South Africa was also concerned,  as existing preferences
benefited the British settler rather than the Dutch farmers.,who kept cattle      The matter had been discussed with theAustralian Delegation at anearlystage on board ship.Early in the Conference it.had been agreed that Dominionsconcerned in the same class of export should form groupsfor purposes of negotiation and meat had been found to concern nearly every Dominion, but principally Australiaand New Zealand.      Mutton and lamb had proved to be the keypoints of the discussion-      Our own agriculture was deeplyinterested in this owing to the fall in prices.    But statisticsrevealed that this fall was due, not to foreign production butto the Dominions themselves.,      At first the Dominions had asked for a duty and a restriction of foreign importsj    theduty, because this would be understood by their own people?the restriction of foreign impo&apos;rts in order to raise prices,without which the duty would not be of much value.      TheUnited Kingdom Delegates had then shown that the Dominionsthemselves and not foreign countries were ruining the markets and had asked what guarantee there was that theywould not repeat this process.      They replied that it was due to exceptionally favourable seasons that were not likelyto recur.      They asked first only for a temporary restriction,but it was elicited that this was because they thought weshould be shy of a permanent restriction, which they would prefer.      The United Kingdom Delegates had then suggestedan ordered regulation of supplies into which all concernedmust enter l.e. Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdomand Argentina.      Their first reaction was hostile to this idea, but,  in the end,  it appealed to them and they ceased to ask for a duty.      At that point,  owing to the indiscretionof a Dominion&apos;s delegate, a speech by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer,  which it had been agreed not to publish, was communicated to a representative of a newspaper, and thisresulted in a set-back.      In the end there was an agreement for an experimental period for a trial of the scheme, during
i eit e*which an effort should he made to produce a more permanent :scheme.     The Chancellor thought that the scheme presented no special difficulties for the Argentine Republic or for anyone else, and, in any event, it was to operate only for 18months.In reply to the Lord Privy Seal the Chancellor of theExchequer expressed the hope that later the Cabinet would consider what was to be said to the Argentine Republic,Russia and foreign countries.     The Dominions had been told that our policy was first to look after ourselves, then theDominions and foreign nations last.      The Dominions were toreceive an expanding share of our trade and, consequently,foreign nations a diminishing share.      Foreign countries were more interested in beef than in mutton and lamb andfor beef there was a standstill arrangement.     He had tried to get the idea of this progressive share for the   Dominionsinto the form of general resalutions, but had encountereddifficulties from the South African and Indian Delegations.South Africa could not accept any resolutions that conveyedthe idea of the Empire having a policy of its own,  and india was apprehensive of any concerted action.At this point the Chancellor of the Exchequer read the resolutions eventually adopted, which will be circulated in due course.The Delegation would have liked to s et up some machinery for preparatory work between Conferences, butthere was much suspicion of any such proposal, especially inCanada, and it had only been possible to secure the appoint-ment of a Committee in London to examine the question.Probably it would be necessary to. begin on a very modest scale, possibly with a statistical bureau.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatthe difficulties of the Conference on the personal side hadnot taken him by surprise, owing to previous experience, andhe gave illustrations of the hostile activities of British aswell as   Dominion influences.     He agreed with the Chancellorof the Exchequer that, if the Conference had not been held,the situation would have been worse in IS months&apos; time;but, had it failed, it would have been worse still.     he emphasised the importance of a competition, as opposed toa prohibitive tariff   in the Dominions, and illustrated it by a reference to a Canadian offer purporting to give65. million dollars of so-called preferences, which had been shown by British experts to be a minus quantity.     he paid a high tribute to Sir Horace Wilson and the Delegationexperts.    The Delegation had had to bear in mind that therestoration of prosperity to the Dominions was an in*dispensable preliminary to the resumption of migration, whichjit had been recognised, when reopened, must be considered on ,a wider basis than heretofore.     He added a number ofillustrations of the tendencies and difficulties of theConference, including some interesting details connectedwith the agreements on steel.In reply to questions as to how the temporaryrestriction of meat imports was to be operated, theChancellor of the Exchequer gave particulars, referring to Schedule H. to the agreement with Australia.     NewZealand already possessed an organisation through whichthe scheme could be operated, and the Australian delegates had satisfied him that there should be no difficulty.He read to the Cabinet the agreed programmes for importsof mutton and lamb from Dominions and foreign countries.
The Argentine Republic was.understood not to attach greatimportance to frozen mutton and lamb exports to the UnitedKingdomoAfter further questions of detail had been answeredby the DelegatesThe Cabinet adjourned at 12.30 p.m. to enablesome members to attend an official luncheon toM. Bonnet.On resuming after the luncheon interval9  the Cabinetfirst discussed the agreements relating to meat.      TheChancellor of the Exchequer explained that Australia did notexport chilled beef, -fefr-^hj^^t^iitereh1 ^fjH^-trire Argeii LiiieiRefwAJgA^Cgs^^ The Cabinet were informedthat what Australia most feared was a change in the food ofthe people9 and comment was made on the reduced consumptionof meat and more especially of beef.Some discussion took place as to the 2/- a quarter dutyon wheat9 and the Delegates expressed the view that theCanadian Government had perhaps desired it for politioalrather than economic advantage.      The Australian delgation had not much liked it, as they apprehended that the wheatdisplaced would have to be sold and would tend to lower the world price of wheat.      This part of the discussionrevealed the desirability of obtaining further informationas to the probable effect of the duty on the price of theloafs having regard to the proportion and origin of softwheat that has to be mixed with the Canadian hard wheat inorder to get the right consistency in bread.Some discussion took place as to the method by which negotiations should be conducted with foreign countries seeking
458commercial arrangements.      There was general agreement that some of the Delegates to the Ottawa Conference wouldhave to concern themselves in such negotiations? &quot;but thatthey must be afforded some rest after their strenuous laboursand the procedure set forth below in conclusions (b) and(c) was agreed to.On the results of the Ottawa Conference as a whole the comment was made that the arrangements to secure competi-tive conditions for British manufacturers in the Dominions?iffairly worked? would confer a tremendous advantage*The Home Secretary (during the discussion referredto in conclusion 2 of the meeting ) entered a caveat thatthis discussion was of a preliminary character? full detailsof the settlement not being available?Vand? therefore? pending a fuller opportunity for consideration of the question hehad to make reserves for his friends and himself on the wholepolicy put before the Cabinet.      In this connection it was explained that it had not yet been possible to circulate allthe documents which were eventually to be published? asDelegates had had to leave immediately after the close of theConference? and the Secretariat had not yet arrived.On the assumption? based on the information atpresent available? that the Ottawa agreements are approved?the Cabinet agreed:-(a)    That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be asked to circulateas soon as possible a Memorandum explain-ing the effect on the price to the con-sumer of the proposed duty on wheat?having regard to the different countries of origin of wheat used to produce the loafin ordinary consumption.
(b)    That, when approached by representativesof Foreign Countries seeking commercial negotiations the Foreign Office should endeavour to obtain written statements which should be referred at once forthe comments of the Government Depart-ments concerned and afterwards consideredby a Cabinet Committee-(c)    That the Cabinet Committee should be composed as followss-The president of the Board of TradeIn the Chair.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.The Secretary of State for Scotland.(d)    That full details of the Ottawa report,resolutions, agreements, &quot;agreedprogrammes&quot; for meat imports,  exchanges of letters, etc.  should be circulated as soon as they are available to theCabinet as secret papers, pending theirpublication on such dates as may bearranged with the Dominions and India.Note.       It is possible that it may benecessary to await the return ofthe Secretariat at the end of theweek to complete the documentation.
2.    The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss thequestion of whether parliament should be summoned atan earlier date, in order to pass the legislation necessary to implement the Ottawa agreements.The Prime Minister said that his firstinstinct had been not to alter the date of themeeting of Parliament.     Later,  however,  thefollowing considerations had presented themselvesto him,  in favour of an earlier meeting ofParliament.      The Parliaments of some of theDominions, including Canada, would be meetingbefore our own Parliament.     Every detail would bepublished and reproduced in our own press.     Havingascertained from the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs that the meetings of the DominionParliaments could not be postponed until october 2/th, he continued that this was an argument in favour of an earlier meeting of our own parliament in order-that statements on Ottawa might be made simultaneously with those in the Parliaments of theDominions.      He added that the next Session ofParliament was bound to be a very heavy one,including legislation on India,  the London TrafficBill and other matters.      The inclusion in theFinance Bill of provisions for implementing theagreementsOttawa/would involve extra Parliamentary time forthat measure.     On the other hand,  if this legisla-tion had been passed in    a   Finance Act before christmas it might result   n an actual curtailment of the time required for the ordinary Finance Bill.To pass the legislation in the new Session before christmas would involve taking Private Members&apos;  time-1 .
once more, and he did not think that theGovernment would like to do this, a view inwhich the Lord President of the Council warmlyconcurred.     All this pointed to the desirabilityof an earlier meeting of Parliament to get thelegislation through during the present Session.Another advantage would be that Ottawa would pass away from the zone of acute controversy.The Cabinet were impressed by the PrimeMinister&apos;s reasoning, but felt that the first step towards a decision was to ascertain whatlegislation was required in order to implement the ottawa agreements.   - When that information was obtained it would be desirable to ascertain whether the Prime Minister of Canada couldsynchronise the meeting of his Parliament withthat of the United Kingdom Parliament.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should ascertain as soon aspossible what legislation was required to implement the ottawa agreements, and how much Parlia-mentary time would be necessary,and to report to the Prime Minister;(b). That the Prime Minister should then consider what date would be convenient for the meeting ofParliament, and should invite theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs to ascertain from theDominions concerned if they couldsynchronise the date of the meetingof their respective Parliamentswith the date proposed by thePrame Minister;(c) That the final decision shouldbe left to the Prime Minister.
MrFUTUREM3ETINGS of the CABINET,(previous reference;Cabinet 45(52), Con-elusion 19(a)5.    After a short discussion on the dates of future meetings,  the Cabinet agreed --(a) That, owing to the present meeting,it was unnecessary to adhere to thedecision mentioned in the marginthat a further meeting should be heldduring the week beginning September 11th(b) That the Prime Minister should, ifpossible, avoid summoning a further meeting before October 10th.
TRADE WITHUSSIA.Refeveno e:Cabinet 45(32). Con-elusion 9,)ft.4.   At their Meeting on August 4th, referred to inthe margin, the Cabinet had approved the following recommendations of the Minister of Labour in C.P.-267(32), with which the Treasury were in agreement:-(a) That from now to the end of December,19 32, the Export Credits guarantee department should be at liberty to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos; forguarantees in&quot;connection with creditsof 12 months or more for exports toRussia for not more than the amountof bills falling due in the last quarter of 1932:    viz., a littlemore than  1,200,000.(b) That none of these credits should beat longer than 18 months, and that theExport&quot;Credits Guarantee department should be asked to arrange that asubstantial proportion is at 12months.(c) That in addition the Department shouldbe at liberty to undertake commitmentsat its discretion in connection withcredits of 9 months or less by arrangement with the Treasury and up to&apos;a limit of  250,000 duringthe period in question.(d) That the decision be treated as strictly confidential and, no public statement made about it.They had further decided that the subject should bekept on the Agenda Paper of the Cabinet and should beraised again on the return of the Chancellor of theExchequer from Ottawa.The Minister of Labour pointed out that theExport Credits   Guarantee Department had not yet advisedas to whether there should be a prolongation to 18months of the guarantees for exports to&apos; Russia,  :.Hesuggested that the Department should be invited to give an opinion on this point.In the course of the discussion on thissuggestion the Cabinet were reminded that, in accordancewith Clause 21  of the Ottawa agreement with Canada, itwould be necessary to denounce the Treaty with theRussian Soviet, and it was pointed out that this was hardly consistent with the policy of iniruJiLlntrg the
The Prime Minister mentioned that he had been asked toreceive a deputation - composed of masters and men -from a firm of machine tool makers in Altrincham about their difficulties in getting guarantees for Russian orders fromthe   Export Credits Guarantee Department.     On investigationhe had learned that the difficulty arose out of the decision ofthe Export Credits Guarantee Department, in execution of theCabinet decision, that the application could be considered on a basis of 12 months&apos; credit, whereas the Russians werestanding out for 18 months.     He gathered that the main difficulty of the Advisory Committee was that they were asked by the Cabinet to secure a substantial proportion of guaranteesat 12 months, and that the only possibility of achieving this result was&apos;to get 12 months&apos; guarantee at the beginning.Once they had given an 18 months&apos; guarantee they would never  .get another at 12 months.     The Prime Minister had no objectionto the Minister of Labour&apos;s proposal, and thought it important that the Export Credits Guarantee Department should alsoreport at once on the working of the decision that asubstantial proportion of the credits should be at 12 months./C Note;     Among the papers that had been submittedto the Prime Minister in connection withthis question was a draft of a memorandum prepared by the Export Credits guarantee department with a view to circulation tothe Cabinet.     The Prime Minister was underthe impression that this document was in thehands of his colleagues, which was not thecase.      Consequently there was some slightmisunderstanding of the position.^The Cabinet agreed:-That the Minister of Labour should ask the Export Credits Guarantee Departmentto r eview the above question at once and make a further report which couldbe considered by the President of theBoard of Trade and the Chancellor of theExchequer.
rpHB IRISHIEE STATE.(previous reference:Cabinet 45(32), Con-elusion 13.)5.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (acting for the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs)  (C.P.-291 (32)) containing a brief resume&apos; of recent developments in the IrishFree State situation.   The subject was dealt with under the following headings:-(l) Discussions between the Prime Ministerand Mr de Valera in London on July 15th.(2) Visit of Miss Ellis to Dublin.(3) Disctissions at Ottawa.(4) Action taken in the United kingdom to watch the situation.(5) Position as regards the Coast DefenceStations in the Irish Free State.(6) Effect of the 20% tariff imposed onIrish Free State produce in theUnited Kingdom.(7) Effect of the Irish Free Stateretaliatory tariff.(8) Attitude of Mr Cosgrave&apos;s Party.(9) General Situation in the Irish FreeS Xi Si u G iThe Prime Minister said that this matter would now rest with the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.The Cabinet took, note of the LordChancellor&apos;s Memorandum (CP. 29/1  (^2))
6.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Political Situationin India:-Notes by the Secretary of State forIndia covering Reports by local governments (C.P.-283 (32), C.P.-285(32) and C.P.-287 (32)):An Appreciation by the-Government ofIndia (C .P.-288 (32)) .The Secretary of State for India reported that last March Mr. Gandhi had written a letter to the effectthat, if the depressed classes were segregated fromthe Hindus by the Communal Decision, he would go onhunger-strike and starve himself to death.      In drawing up the terms of the Communal Decision great care hadbeen taken not to segregate the depressed classes, andall concerned had been agreed that the decision wouldnot justify Mr. Gandhi in carrying out his threat.Nevertheless the Viceroy had now telegraphed that Mr.Gandhi had written a letter&apos; to the Prime Minister in whichhe expressed his intention to starve himself to deathunless the Communal Decision was reversed beforeSecretary of StateSeptember 20th.  The/ and his advisers were agreed thatMr.  Gandhi should be informed in reply that it wasimpossible to alter the Communal Decision, but that itshould, be explained that he was acting under a completemisapprehension on the two points raised in his letter,Mr.  Gandhi had asked that the correspondence should bepublished, and the Secretary of State reported thatthe Prime Minister agreed with him that this should bedone.      The question then arose as to what was to bedone if Mr.  Gandhi started to hunger-strike on September 20th.Thd Secretary of State and his advisers felt that inthat event Mr.  Gandhi should be released.The next question was as to whether he shouldbe released at once when he started hunger-striking,  orwhen he became weaker.      The Viceroy had at firstinclined to the latter course, but now thought it would17.
ISbe best to set him free when he began to hunger-strike.     Mr.  Gandhi had made it clear that hewouldhunger-strike just the same whether he wasin prison or not.The Secretary of State said he had drafted aletter for the Prime Minister to send to Mr. Gandhijthat the Viceroy had agreed to it,  and that thePrime Minister would now consider it.After a short discussion, the cabinet agreed  That, in the event of Mr.  Gandhistarting to hunger-strike, heshould be released, and that thedecision as to the exact moment of release should be left to theSecretary of State for India, whosaid he would consult the PrimeMinister.
E7.The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumious*ence:by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland (C.-P. 290 (32)) on the subject of the secondinstalment of the cut in Police pay.The Memorandumdid not at this stage put forward any definiteproposal, but gave particulars in precise terms of the undertakings given to the Police on behalf of theGovernment a year ago.The Home Secretary reported that his department had examined the economies made by the Pooice, which might amount to from 2 to 2-g- per cent, of the proposed cut.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer, as Chairman of the CabinetCommittee, pointed out that the Committee had last met onMay 10th.      At the end of that Mooting, as recorded in theMinutes (E.P.E.

The replies had not been received until about the time of, and probably after, the departure forOttawa of the Chairman and some of the members of the CabinetCommittee.      Consequently, there had been no opportunity to assemble the Cabinet Committee, and in the circumstances he asked that the undertakings given by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and himself in t he time of the late Governmentshould be honoured.The Chancellor of the Exchequer read a number ofextracts from the Minut4s of the Second Meeting of the Cabinet[Committee on Economies in Police Expenditure (B.P.E.. (52),[        - &apos; &apos; &apos;   &apos;tSeeond Meeting) to show how seriously the Heads of the fightingIfServices,  the late Minister of Education,  and the permanentsSecretary to the Treasury, representing the Civil Service,regarded the proposal that the second cut on the pay of theijPolice should be remitted.The First Lord of the Admiralty warned the Cabinetthat, after the Invergordon incident,  the Naval Authorities* . fairviewetv-with the un^ost apprehension the prospect of anyremission of the second instalment of cuts of Police pay.
The total emolument of Naval ranks and rates was much below that of Police Constables although the former hadto maintain? as it were, two establishments - one afloat andone on shore.The Prime Minister referred to the decision of theCabinet of September 1st 1931 on which the assurances givenby the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for scotland were based; viz:&quot;(a)    That in the case of any Department requiredto effect economies in the present emergency? theDepartment should have discretion?  after con-sultation and in agreement with the Treasury? torealise the economies in the best manner attain-able, provided that the amount so realised is notless than the economy figure as determined by theCabinet.     The economies are in general stated asthe reductions which will be made in Estimatesfrom 1932.      Savings should also be effected inthe current year by bringing into operation the economy measures proposed at the earliest possible date&quot; .He pointed out that this decision was a general one covering the economies as a whole and that the marginal heading in theCabinet Minutes was &quot;Miscellaneous   Recommendations&quot;.    this statement, he pointed out, which had been intended to enableDepartments to find alternative administrative economiesto those proposed, had been narrowed down to a single Depart-ment and to a question of pay which raised the whole questionof equality in sacrifice in the various services.      this resolution was&apos; never meant to justify that.      Strictly speaking?the Home Secretary could not claim that general departmentaleconomies should be credited to Police pay.      Cuts on pay and wages, he thought;, ought not to be found except from pay and wages, e. g. the reduction now made in the pay of Policeentrants.      Otherwise consequential difficulties were raised in other Departments.The Home Secretary drew attention to the following passage in the White Paper on Reductions cpf national expenditure (Cmd 3952) page 7 applying specifically to thepolice -

But the First Lord of the Admiralty againwarned the Cabinet of the strong objections of his NavalAdvisers to any reduction in cuts.The Home   Secretary pointed out that, in the c ase ofthe Police, the 5 per cent, cut applied practically to thewhole of the policeman&apos;s emoluments, whereas, in the caseof the Navy, the cut only applied to about half the totalemoluments, namely that part which represented substantivepay.

The Policehad co-operated in finding these economies and undoubtedlybelieved that the intention was to deduct them from the cuts in pay.The Secretary of State for Air offered to meet re-presentatives of the Army and Royal Air Force and, if theFirst Lord agreed, of the Navy, and to discuss the question with them.     But the First Lord of the Admiralty againwarned the Cabinet of the strong objections of his NavalAdvisers to any reduction in cuts.The Home   Secretary pointed out that, in the c ase ofthe Police, the 5 per cent, cut applied practically to thewhole of the policeman&apos;s emoluments, whereas, in the caseof the Navy, the cut only applied to about half the totalemoluments, namely that part which represented substantivepay.      Consequently, 5 per cent, cut in the case of the
Police pay was in fact equivalent to a 10 per cent,  cut in the case of the Navy,As regards teachers, he pointed out that the MayCommittee had recommended a 20 percent cut in teachers&apos;salaries, hut only a 12-g- percent cut in the pay of thePolice.     The Government had reduced the May CommitteeTsrecommendation in the case of teachers from SO per cent,to 10 per cent, and there was some justification for thePolice contention that they should he subjected to acorresponding percentage reduction.The Cabinet agreed;-(a) To accept a proposal that the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, in the light of thediscussion,  should now prepare adefinite scheme for the solutionof the difficulty and should discuss it with the Treasury,(b) That their scheme should be submittedto the Prime Minister with a view tocirculation to the Cabinet, and ifthey encountered unsurmountabledifficulties they should report themto the Prime Minister,  who should con-side r how they would be dealt with.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP. 274 (32)) covering the Report ofa.Select Committee of the House of Commons on the subjectof Sky Writing and Sky Shouting.     The Report containscertain proposals for legislation.     These include thecomplete prohibition of sky shouting!    and the prohibitionof sky writing in rural areas, and in boroughs and urban districts having less than 20,000 population, except on special occasions permitted by the Local Authorities.The Committee.do not recommend the prohibition of sky-writing elsewhere, but consider that a central department should have power to make regulations for securing public safety in connection with air navigation, ocoastal lines,etc., and to protect ancient monuments or buildings of historic importance.     The prohibition of sky-writingon Sundays is also recommended.In his Memorandum the Home Secretary gave hisopinion that action might properly be taken on the lines recommended by the Committee, and asked the approval ofthe Cabinet -(a) for the summoning of a Conference,suchas is suggested in the Report,with a viewto the establishment of a voluntary bodyof control, and(b) for the preparation of a Bill to s ecurethe legislative powers recommended by theCommittee.
4 nThe Cabinet agreed.-(1)    To approve the proposal of the HomeSecretary for the summoning of aConference as proposed in (a) above;(2)   That the Board of Trade should berepresented at the Conference;(5)   That the Report of the Conference shouldbe laid before the Cabinet before adecision is taken for the preparation ofa Bill.

The RoyalAir Force are to be congratulated on a very fine-performance - both in bringing the Barzan operations to a speedy and most successful conclusion and intransporting nearly 600 men and equipment without ahitch across 800 miles of desert at the most difficulttime of year.
