THE&apos;.lausanne conference.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(32), Con-clusion 3.)The sc-called^Gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot; .1. The Cabinet had. before them a proof copy ofa White Paper containing the Final Act of the lausanne Conference, covering the following documents:1.   Agreement with Germany .2.   Transitional Measures relating,to Germany.3.   Non-German Reparations.4.   Resolution relating to central and Eastern Europe.5.   Resolution relating to a world economic and Financial Conference .In view of the heavy Agenda Paper before theCabinet the Prime Minister did not attempt to give any general account of the Lausanne Conference, whichwould have involved a long and complicated statement .He contented himself with answering questions on certain specific points..The interest of the Cabinet was mainly concen-trated on the proce-s-verba 1 which has been referredto as a &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot;.    In the course ofthe Meeting the Prime Minister read the text to theCabinet (Appendix).The Cabinet were informed, that this documenthad been prepared to provide for the possibilitiesarising out of the eventual settlement of theAmerican debts ,   No country had felt that they couldcancel debts owing to them while the possibilities oftheir having to pay their debts to America were completely uncertain.   The Americans, however, had always insisted on War Debts being independent of reparations, and this had made it impossible toinclude the &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot; in the mainAgreement with Germany.   It had been necessary tokeep it as&apos;far as possible in the background.All concerned had adopted the view that the mainAgreement with Germany would not be valid until itwas ratified.   The so-ealled &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot;-1-
provided that ratification would not be effected until a satisfactory settlement had been reached between the creditor Governments and the United States of America.In that event the Creditor Governments would ratifyand the Agreement with Germany would come into full effect.   But if no such settlement could be obtained,the Agreement with Germany would not be ratified, a new situation would have arisen, and the Governmentsinterested would have to consult on what was to be done.The legal position would then revert to that which existed before the Hoover moratorium.The Cabinet were informed that M, Herriot hadin publicalready referred/to the &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot;, andit had been mentioned in an English newspaper.In view of this half-publicity the Cabinet realised that there would certainly be a demand in parliament the same afternoon for the publication of the proces-verbal.    Suspicions would be aroused that somethingwas being kept back if it were not published.The Cabinet were reminded that by the terms of the document it was open to the Creditor Governments onwhose behalf the proces-verbal was initialled, to explain the position to their respective Parliaments, but itcould not be published without the permission of thefour Governments concerned.It was suggested that the Prime Minister should explain to the House of Commons that Reparations was aglobal responsibility which could only be discharged by all the Powers acting together, and that the so-called&quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot; was only a recognition of an obvious fact.The Cabinet were reminded that the document had actually been communicated to the German Government.
Although it was recognised that publication mighthave an unfortunate effect both in America and inGermany, in view of the half-publicity which had takenplace, the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should give adescription of the proces--verba.i(Appendix) in his speech in the Houseof Commons the same afternoon, and, ifpressed to publish, should agree to doso after the consent of the otherGovernments concerned had been obtained.The Cabinet placed on record their very high appreciation of the work of thePrime Minister and his colleagues at lausanne, and the Prime Minister paid a tribute to his colleagues on theUnited Kingdom Delegation.

The War had
1Iproved the contrary.   On countless occasions theRoyal Air Force had been called on to come to the aid of ground forces .   The case of the Air Ministry wasthat they made a tremendous contribution to thedefence of the country as a. whole, and that in thefuture they must inevitably play an even moreimportant role.   To give up bombing was to surrenderwhat, in the long run, would prove our best defence.It was natural that the small nations who could not use it effectively wanted to get rid of this methodof warfare;    but that was not a sound reason forour abandoning the best form of defence.,    It was anillusion to suppose that a rule of war would preventthe use of bombing in time of war.    In the eventevery aeroplane would use the best weapon at its disposal.   The example of the Declaration of Londonproved the futility of rules of war.   As shown inthe Report of the Lord President&apos;s Sub-Committee, theresult of the abolition of bombing must be to reduce our Air forces to an inferior position to those of countries with a large conscript army.   On the whole he advocated procrastination and insistence on consideration of the Air with other forms of disarmament.The Cabinet-were reminded that the abolition of bombing would not prevent the French from retaining the greater part of their Air forces on the groundthat they were Army co-operation machines ,   Thatwou^d give them an overwhelming advantage.   Thewhole Air problem of Europe was dependent on thestrength of the French Air Force, which would hardly be affected by the proposed rule.The attention of the Cabinet was called to thefollowing passage contained in the recent Declarationof British Disarmament Policy (Cmd.4122)-5-
&quot;There Is no aspect of internationaldisarmament more vitally -urgent thanthe adoption without delay of themost effective measures to preserve the civilian population from thefearful horrors of bombardment fromthe air.   The Government of the UnitedKingdom would be prepared to go to any length in agreement with other Powersto achieve this object, and if more drastic measures are proposed fromany other quarter and are shown tobe practicable they will examine themwith the utmost sympathy.They propose that the High ContractingParties should agree between themselvesin respect of their Air forces thatthere should be:-(1) The complete prohibition of bombingfrom the air, sa^within limits tobe laid down as precisely as possible by an International Convention.Attacks upon the civilian population will be entirely prohibited;(3) A strict limitation in the unladen weight of all military and naval aircraft (troop carriers and flying boats excepted);(3) A restriction in the numbers ofall kinds of military and naval aircraft&quot;.Those words, it was pointed out, were certain to be quoted during the discussions at Geneva.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet that after the way had been prepared forthe acceptance of the Resolution it would be moved by Dr. Benes.    It would then be open to other delegations to make their own observations .   Hesuggested that the best course would, be for one ofthe United Kingdom Delegates to quote the passagereferred to above and, while accepting the Resolution,to point out that the application of the principledid involve some difficulties owing to the fact that military machines other than bombers, as well ascivilian machines,  could be used for bombing:   thatis to say, we should commit ourselves to the
principle of the abolition of bombing while givingwarning as to the difficulties of application.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that president Hoover had made clear in his proposals that naval, military and air disarmament stood together.It was inconsistent with that principle to pick outone form &quot;f warfare on which to lay stress ,   any agreement reached should be contingent on acceptanceof a comprehensive scheme.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the United Kingdom -delegation at the Disarmament Conference mustnot stand alone at Geneva on thequestion of the prohibition, asbetween the Contracting Parties,of bombardment from the air, or beput in a position of responsibilityfor the failure of the DisarmamentConference in this respect;   butthat -(b) During the discussions on the resolution to be moved at Geneva one of the UnitedKingdom Delegates should take occasion to call attention to the passage quoted above in the Declaration of BritishDisarmament Policy (Cmd. 4122, paragraphIS) and to point out the difficulties that must arise in the application ofthe principle as mentioned above:(c) That the course to be adopted&quot; at thenext session of the Disarmament confer-ence, when the application of the principle was under consideration, should be left for future decision.
EVA CONFERENCE:Id Pulp?JLjpus Reference:g(32) Conclusion3.   The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs drew attention to a proposal to make an Order underthe Import Duties Act transferring certain categories of unsawn wood to the Free List.     He had just learnt .that the Canadian Government v/ould ask for a preferenceon certain commodities including timber and timberproducts, but he was not clear as to whether Mr.Bennett would ask for preference on pulp.     In thecircumstances he wished to consult the Cabinet as towhether it would be pradent to issue the Order on thevery day on which the United Kingdom Delegation wasleaving for Canada.     The subject was not one ofgreat importance., but the issue of the order mightcreate an unfavourable impression at that moment.The Cabinet were informed that it would be extremelydifficult to hold up the Order which related to wood pulp.      It had leaked out that the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee had recommended that this material shouldbe placed on the Free List.      Importers&apos;had made their arrangements on that basis5 and up to now no difficulties1had been anticipated.      The Canadian import a tion wasivery small.     If the order was not issued, there would be much disappointment and resentment.The Cabinet^ while sympathizing with the motiveof the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, feltthat matters had gone too far in the other direction,and accordingly agreed that the issue of the Orderplacing wood pulp on the Free List should not beinterfered with.

EDUCTION ANDIMITATION OP/LAMENTS.fhe Disarmamentf onferenc e.lontrol by thePermanen t)is armamentJommission.I previous reference:;a,binet 43jfulion0!1.)5.-        The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-246 (32))Circulating for consideration a Memorandum by theUnited Kingdom Delegation at Geneva on the subjectof the control to be exercised over the execution ofthe Disarmament Convention by the proposed&quot;permanent disarmament Commission,In the Memorandum it was pointed out that Commis-sions of the League of Nations are more inclined to be over-cautious than over-active, and that in any caseany disadvantage of this kind was outweighed   by thesupreme importance of enabling countries to feelassured that their neighbours who signed the Covenantwere really observing it.It was suggested that if the power of requiring aGovernment to permit an international investigation,within its own territory, was considered too large a power to be entrusted, to the Permanent disarmament commission, that Commission, if it considered that the inquiry could not be carried out adequately withoutlocal inspection, should refer the matter to the Counei.1of the League of Nations, together with the representa-tives  of      signatory Powers not members of the League:if that body confirmed the necessity of inspection,then the State concerned should be required to givethe necessary facilities.The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary tothe Admiralty,, who was summoned to the Cabinet inthe absence of the First Lord of the Admiraltysaid that the Admiralty were apprehensive lest911.
if &quot;building were carried out secretly9 it would be difficultto discover.      Their main objection to the proposal,,however was that our own stocks of war material were very low and if subjected to international inspectionour weakness would be laid tare.      If inspection were allowed stocks would have to be increased.It was pointed out5 however  that in order tomake an inspection   a  specific allegation would haveto be laid to our charge.      In our case it wouldprobably be difficult to find an excuse for this.In support of the proposal the Cabinet were informed that the French Government considered thatthe Permament Disarmament Commission would have little value without some power of inspection.      The JapaneseGovernment took the same view.The Cabinet were reminded that in the present case there was no risk of our being isolated.      No lessthan six powers including Italy9 Japana and the UnitedStates of America had expressed themselves as opposed toinspection as not calculated to create a spiritof goodwill.      In February the Cabinet had approved the Committee of Imperial Defence&apos;s Memorandum (C.I.D.Paper No.  1079B)   (CP.  5 (32)) 9 in which inspection wascondemned.      That  the proposed international inspectionwould be iiseless as a means of checking armamentswas proved by the experience of the Commission ofControl in Germany9  set up in the Treaty of Versailles.With all the drastic powers at its disposal theCommission had admittedly not succeeded in detectinginfractions.      Long before inspectors arrived9all traces of the evidence would have been removed.
Inspection, it was claimed, would arouse ill-feeling and jealousy possibly at a criticaljuncture in the international situation, andmight even lead to the persistence of hostilities.The? Cabinet agreed:-(a)that the question of international supervision might be dealt with bythe following formula:-&quot;The Convention shall provide for^the&quot;establishment of a permanent Dis-&quot;armament Commission with the Con-&quot;stitution &apos;   rights and duties generally&quot;as outlined in Part VI of the Draft&quot;Disarmament Convention, drawn up by&quot;the Preparatory Commission,with such&quot;alterations as may be necessary to&quot;increase the effectiveness of the&quot;Commission.(b)that the question of Budgetary Limitationshould be kept in reserve in connectionwith the Resolution now under consideration.
a u60    The Prime Minister made a statement to theCabinet as to a matter on which some confusionhad arisen.He recalled that,  in the past,  the GermanGovernment,  on such matters as Disarmament,  theirdissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles,etc., had been in the habit of approaching HisMajesty&apos;s Government separately.      If we adopted a sympathetic attitude German advances went further.Sometimes the French Government had become suspiciousand uncertain as to our attitude.      It had been thought advisable at the Lausanne Conference to try to secure French co-operation in all suchmatters, by a policy of candour.The first move&apos;had been made at a time when there was under consideration a draft of an agreement to be signed by the Six Inviting Powers, by whichthey undertook not to entertain any politicalquestion affecting interests which are common toany two or more of them, and arising out of the treaties or Instruments to which they are parties,without a preliminary friendly consultation.On July 5th rather a difficult situation had arisen with the French Delegation, and in a discussionwith M. Herriot the Prime Minister had read and handed to him a copy of a document which hadbeen prepared for him in the Delegation.     the document had begun by a reference to the draft ofthe agreement, referred to above, of the Six InvitingPowers, and had continued to indicate, by way ofillustration, that,  in the application ofthat proposed agreement, when Germany raisedpoints in connection with the liberation of
Germany from her obligations under the Treaty ofVersailles, His Majesty&apos;s Government would returnno definite answer to the German Government until they had first talked the matter over with the FrenchGovernment, T,vho were to adopt reciprocal methods.It was not to be a question of an agreement to agree,ratheror to make joint representations, but/not to reach any conclusions with regard to any such particular question until we had talked it over with the FrenchGovernment:    that is to say, a preliminary eaohangeof views with the French Government, coupled witha general desire to come to an agreement.      If theGerman Government made communications on such matters and asked us to treat them as confidential, andnot to pass them on to third parties, we should saythat it would be impossible for us to express an opinion in such circumstances, and that our purpose was to get European tranquillity, an aim to which piecemeal communications were no contribution.An allusion had also been made in the statement tothe desirability of close concert,  in order tofind a solution to Disarmament problems;    to theWorld Economic Conference,  on which careful and practical preparation between the two Governmentswas necessary;    and to the desirability, pendingthe discussion of commercial relations after the ottawa Conference,  that no step should be taken by either country to render relations more difficult.All the above had been on the assumptionthat there would a Six-Power pact, or a politicaltruce.      Both these ideas had subsequently fallen
9 2to the ground.   At a late stage, when the Conference was working under the heaviest pressure, the Prime minister had, on an informal occasion, been shown M, Herriofsre-draft, in French, of his statement, from which the first paragraph relating to the Six-Power Pact had been cut out.At the end of the Conference, notwithstanding the disappointing failure of the proposal for a politicaltruce, the Prime Minister and his colleagues had feltnevertheless that they should still work for the mostamicable understanding between France and Great Britain.It had been felt very undesirable to make an announcementat Lausanne, as this might give a misleading impression.At this point in the Prime Ministers statement the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read an extractfrom a conversation at Lausanne between British and FrenchDelegates on July 8th (Appendix II).The Prime Minister then stated that it had beenarranged that the Foreign Secretary,on his return to London,should draft a despatch to Lord Tyrrell.   The matter was at that moment the subject of telegraphic exchanges withParis .    It was hoped that it would be cleared up andM. Herriot would accept the form in which we proposed that astatement might be made.   Under that form, as the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet, thearrangement would not appear as an Anglo-French agreement,but as a method of carrying out the Declaration which formed part of the Final Act of the Lausanne Conference, - a methodwhich could be extended to other Governments.   M. Herriotwas anxious to make a statement on the subject in theChamber the same afternoon.     If he accepted theproposal of the British Government there would beno difficulty in this .    If, however, he wished toamend it, the statement could not be made by M. Herriotor by the Prime Minister without further consultation.
SI TUITION IN 7. The following aspects of the Irish SituationIRISH FREEE* were brought to the notice of the Cabinet in aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominionissue of thesury Order Affairs.    (CP. 248 (32)).other connectedions.(1) The date for the imposition of thespecial duties to make good the losses sustained by the revenue of the UnitedKingdom owing to the default of the IrishFree State.tsT/VDl 12&quot; The draft (CP.  236 (32)) of the/    &apos; necessary Order had been approved at themeeting referred to in the margin, but no decision   had been taken regarding thedate of its issues    in the meantime theBill under which it would be made had been passed through both Houses of Parliament.If the Order were made immediately after theRoyal Assent had been signified, it could take effect by Friday, July 15th.The Secretary of State proposed to publish with the Order a short statement(Appendix I to CP   248 (32)) of the BritishGovernment&apos;s position in the matter ofthe Land Annuities and the other outstand-ing payments.vious Referencesnet 42(32) Con-ions 3 and 5.)(ii) The possibility of a further reply from&apos; Mr. de Valera before the issue Of theOrder.    The Secretary of State&apos;s view wasthat if Mr. de Valera accepted arbitrationbjr a Commonwealth Tribunal on the land annuities question (even without an agreed settlement of the other financial issues)the Order should be suspendeds    we should,however, insist on the outstanding land annuities being paid over,  e.g. to theBank of Montreal?    that if the replypointed to a continuance of genuinenegotiations, the Order might likewise be suspended! but that if the reply showed no desire to reach a satisfactory agreement,the issue of the Order should proceed.(iii) Procedure in the Event of arbitration by a Commonwealth Tribunal being accepted.It was thought That Mr.&quot; de Valera mighthave in mind the nomination of an Indianextremist to the Tribunal, and that ourcourse should.be to insist on the termsof refdrence of the Tribunal being mutually agreed before its personnel was considered.
(iv) Position of the   Governor-General.The possible issues to the dispute revealedin the correspondence recently published(and reproduced in Appendix II) were examined.      It was possible thatMr. McNeill might offer to resign, or that Mr.  de Valera might ash for hisdismissal, and it was conceivable thata position might arise where theacceptance of ministerial advice by TheKing might become an issue at an IrishGeneral Election.The only question on which the Cabinet was askedfor a decision was as to whether the Statement(Appendix I to CP.-248 (32)) should be issuedsimultaneously with the Order relating to SpecialDut ies .The Cabinet agreed  That the Order should be issued withoutthe Statement;    that it should be signed the same evening;    should be published in the newspapers of Wednesday, July13th; and should take effect on the night of Thursday, July 14th.

APPENDIX    II.THE LAUSANNE CONFERENCE, 1933.EXTRACT from NOTES of a Conversation held between representatives of Great Britain and France9 withthe Prime Minister as President of the Conference9in the Chair, at the Hotel Beau-Rivages Lausanne9on Fridays July 8th, 19329 at 11.15 a.m.X X X X X XSIR JOHN SIMON said that there was one otherquestion outstanding.      He reminded Mr. MacDonald that hehad said that the British Government v/ould be prepared^assuming that the Six Power Pact was signed: -(1) To undertake to communicate v/ith the FrenchGovernment on all questions of Treaty revision raised byGermany9 and to let them know its opinions and thatthere would be no private discussion with Germany withoutletting the French Government know,(2) To secure that the French and British Delegationsshould work in close concert at the Geneva DisarmamentConference.(3) To concert with the French Government for apractical preparation of the World Economic conferences and(4) To avoid any discriminatory commercial legisla-tion vis-a-vis France pending the negotiation of aCommercial Treaty9 provided that the French Governmentacted similarly.But all that had been dependent on the Six PowerPact or a political truce9 and now both those ideas had fallen to the ground.Sir John Simon added that M. Herriot had asked him on the preceding evening to let him know if the BritishGovernment was still ready to give such assurances.
MR. MACDONALD said he had been very much dis-appointed by the failure of the proposal for the politicaltruce.      He had trusted to the truce to improve Franco-British relations.      He would not disguise the fact thatin recent years he thought Franco-British relations hadconsiderably deteriorated.      He had hoped that the resultof the conclusion of a political truce would have been,so far as Franco-British relations were concerned, thathe would have been enabled to go back to London and say there would be no more trouble between the twocountries.      However, he was still anxious to come to theunderstanding, which he had - indicated in his speech at the meetings of July 5th.    (L.G.B.F. 9th meeting July 5th9 a.m.)        His colleagues shared his viev/s and theBritish Government would still work for the most amicableunderstanding between France and Great Britain.As regards the points raised by Sir .John Simon,the first was that of the attitude of the French andBritish Governments should new questions of Treatyrevision be raised by Germany.     What he had said onJuly 5th on that point held good.      The actual passage inhis speech of July 5th to which Mr. MacDonald referredwas, he said, that beginning &apos;0n all points raised byGermany&apos;, and ending &apos;We should expect the FrenchGovernment to act similarly&apos;.     He understood that theFrench Government did undertake to act similarly.M. HERRIOT said that that was so.MR. MACDONALD then referred to the passage in his speech of July 5th in which he stated that &apos;Indeed to check the German tendency to these piecemeal approaches,I should be inclined to intimate privately to the German
Delegation &quot;before it leaves Lausanne that we should deal in future with any such approaches in accordance with thespirit of the agreement which we are going to sign.Candour is our policy.&apos;      lie felt obliged to point outthat the Germans were receiving a good many blows at lausanne and he did not think it would be wise for him,in the present circumstances, to go and make this further communication to herr von Papen0      That might beintimated by the Foreign Office at some future date,but he would undertake that when any point covered bythe Anglo-French understanding on this matter arose, his reply would be in the sense of the sentence quoted above.The French Government could-be assured that candour wasthe British Government1s policy.As regards disarmament, the World EconomicConference, and commercial relations, Mr. MacDonald-said   his statements on those points stood?  and he understood.that the French Government agreed.Ivl. HERRIOT said that that v/as so.SIR JOHN SIMON said there was one further point about which it was necessary to be very clear.     It was most important.     The French Government now had theBritish Government&apos;s promise about their attitude toGermany.      That was a promise and would be kept.     Asregards the confirmation of that promise, he intended tosend a despatch to Lord Tyrrell and instruct him tomake a communication to M. Herriot, to which he wouldbe very grateful if Mo Herriot would reply.      Itwould not, however, do to announce this understandingat Lausanne, or in the French Chamber, until M. Herriothad had Lord Tyrrell1s communication.
Hotel Beau Rinage sLausanne sJune 8th, 1952.M, HERRIOT said he understood there were twopoints5 the form of the announcement and the date atwhich it would he made.      He understood it wouldnot he made at Lausanne.     Perhaps the two governments could find a formula between them; they would notsnaturally communicate details.MR. MACDONALD  said that they must not   make an announcement and   give the impression that theFrench and British Governments had made inLausanne a new alliance against Europe.SIR JOHN SIMON added that directly he returned to London he would draft a despatch to LordTyrrell.     Lord Tyrrell wpuld ask to see M.   Herriot.He would read him the despatch, or else communicate the contents to him.     M. Herriot v/ould reply and atthe same time an arrangement respecting theannouncement to the Press would be made.     For themoment there would be no announcement.-(The meeting then t e rmin a ted).
