1M-WAR CABINET 199  fa) .MINUTES of a Meeting held irt the Chancellor of the ExchequersRoom at the House of Commons, on Monday, July 30, 1917, at.30 p.m.glDERSOH1S    (1) The War Cabinet resumed their discussion of theT TO PARIS.question raised by Mr. Arthur HendersonTs visit toStockholmerence. Paris (War Cabinet 198 (a)J.    The Prime Minister con-firmed the information that had been given to the WarCabinet in the morning by the Chancellor of the exchequer.-uer, namely, that in sanctioning Mr. Henders.onIs pro-posal to summon a Conference of the Socialist parties of the Allies and to take an active part in It he hadnot been aware that it involved a visit to Paris in company with Mr. Ramsay Macdonald.    It was generally agreed that, so far as at present could be judged, itwas not desirable for the British nation to be repres-ented at the Stockholm Conference.    The situation had altered materially since the time when the conference had first been proposed,when some Members of the WarCabinet had favoured British representation on theground that if the Russian Socialists were committed to. a meeting with the German Socialists, Allied representsatives should be present, not only to present the case&apos;from the Allied, point of view to the Neutral Stateswh* would be present, but also to watch the situationin the Allied interests.    In these circumstances, itwas felt that the situation would require very careful handling.    It was pointed out that the influence of theIndependent Labour Party and of the Pacifist organisa-tions would probably be exerted to manoeuvre the LabourParty and the British Government into a difficult posi-tion.    The series of conferences now contemplated would
give an opportunity for this.    One step would lead toanother.    First, Mr. HendersonTs visit to Paris withMr. Ramsay Macdonald immediately following the debate on War Aims in the House of Commons might be proclaimedas an indication that a Member of the.British Govern-ment had associated himself, to some extent, with Mr.Ramsay Macdons-ld1^ views.    If the Paris Confex*ence was followed by an inter--Allied Conference which decided,as it might do, in favour of representation at StockshOifcm, it was possible that the British Labour Party,in its sixbsequent meeting, would, not feel justified indissociating itself from such representation.    If once the Stockholm Conference took place, it was possiblethat the hands of the Governments might be forced; thatoxie or other of the Allied Governments might find itselfpractically committed to terms of peace which did not meet the views of the Allies as a whole; and that thesituation in regard to the making of peace might betaken, to a great extent, out of the control of theGovernments.    If, however, the British labour Ba.rtyhad declared in favour of representation at the Stock-.holm Conference, the only means the Government wouldhave of preventing such representation would be by the refusal of passports.    It was pointed out that theFrench, Italian, and the United States governments might refuse passports to their Socialist representa^tives.    It was felt, however, by the War Cabinet thatif.the British Labour Party had endorsed a decision by .the Inter-Allied Socialist Parties in favour of repres-representation  at Stockholm, it might be difficult to re-fuse passports without making a breach in the identity of views which has hitherto prevailed on the subject ofthe. prosecution of the war between the British LabourParty and the other Parties represented in the Coalition.      v:h::.&apos;---::;: &apos; -   2. &apos; .
