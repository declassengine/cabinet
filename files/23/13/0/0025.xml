fThis Documentiis the Property of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government)&apos;.RET.WAR CABINS?!?-256a.O DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street,  S.W.on WEDNESDAY,  OCTOBER  4, 1917, at IS.15 p.m.EEL AND. (If With reference to War Cabinet 255a, Minute 1, theSecretary stated that the Chief Secretary for Irelandwished for an opportunity for farther consultation withthe War Cabinet in regard to the decisions taken on theprevious day.    He understood that the principal point onwhich Mr. Duke wished to consult them was the question ofthe arrest of de Valera which had been approved by theWar Cabinet.    In view of the course of the Debate in Par-liament Mr. Bu&apos;ce felt some doubt as to whether immediate action should be  taken or whether it should not be defer-red until de Yalera again contravened the law.The War Cabinet decided that;-In view of the pressure of other urgent business,and particularly owing to the absence of Sir edward carson, it would not be convenient to discuss thequestion that morning, but that it should be raised at fne first meeting at which Sir Edward Carsonwould be present.    In the meantime, they instructed the Secretary to inform Mr, Duke that their decisionon the previous day was not intended to fetter his discretion In postponing the arrest of de Yalera ifhe thought adv1s ab1e.JSESAL MIL-    (Z) With reference to War Cabinet 255a, Minute 2,  theIARY POLICY.War Cabinet again discussed the question as to whetherthe Reports submitted by Field Marshal Lord French and lieutenant-General Sir Henry Wilson should becommunicated in their present form to the Chief of theImperial General Staff and the Field Marshal commanding the British Expeditionary Force, North France,1.
Three suggestions were discussed:-(i) The suggestion of the secretary of btate forWar that Lord French and Sir Henry Wilson shouldhe ashed to submit a short statement containingsolely the action which they recommended; andthat this document only should be communicated toGeneral Robertson and Field Marshal Haig for theirremarks:(ii)  That Lord French should be ashed to modify his report in such a manner that, without altering thegeneral argument, it would he less liable to cause friction &quot;when communicated to General Kobert-son end Field Marshal Haig:(iii)  That the Reports should be communicated to general robertson and Field Marshal Eaig in their exist-ing form.In favour of the first proposal the secretary of Statefor ;v&apos;ar urged that it would obviate the necessity for a reply followed, in all probability, by a rejoinder, andthus tend to expedite a decision. Further, it would re-move all cause of friction.In favour of the second course it v/as pointed out thatField Marshal Lord French&apos;s Memorandum contained many an-imadversions upon tne advice given by General Robertsonand Field Marshal Haig which were not in the least necess-ary for the constructive proposals that were made, andthat there should be no difficulty in making modifications which would alter the whole tone of the Memorandum with-out affecting the general argument.In favour of the third course it was pointed out thatit would be very difficult to ask Lord French or air henry wilson to modify their Memoranda.    They had been invitedto give the War Cabinet the benefit of their views, andthey had done so with great courage and independence andwith full knowledge of their responsibility.    When sir douglas Haig had been invited by Mr. Asquith at the WarCouncils of August 5 and 6, 1914,  to express his views,he had done so with equal candour and had not hesitated to
ask a number of questions which reflected on the advice of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff of that day.It would not be fair to General Robertson and Field Mar-shal Haig to keep back from them arguments which might af-fect the decision of the  Var Cabinet, and they ought tobe given a full opportunity to reply to any animadversionsmade upon their judgment.    If the Reports were altered orkept back,  the fact would almost certainly leak out sooner or later and there might be serious trouble.    It was sug-gested that the criticism of General Robertson and field marshal Haig was of a nature at which politicians wouldnot complain, although this view was not agreed to unani-mously.    The questions of policy raised by the Report,namely, as to whether we should continue our offensive onthe present lines,  or should delay until the army of theUnited States of America could operate effectively,  in-volved decisions of the utmost importance on which the fate of the country might depend, and it wa3 suggestedthat, in such circumstances, General Robertson and field marshal Haig ought not to resent criticism.The question was adjourned for further consideration.
$STERN       (3)  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the out.&quot;  War Cabinet the following summary of recent negotiationsjsion ofBritish   in regard to the French request for an extension of theBritish line in France:-At the recent Boulogne Conference M. Painleve and Gen-eral Foch raised the question of oar talcing over more ofthe French line.    Our answer was that while we were pre-pared to do what we could to assist and agreed to theprinciple, we could not discuss the matter in the ab-sence of Field Marshal Eaig;  that due regard must be hadto next year&apos;s plan of operations and to the resting andtraining of our troops in the meantimeJ and that in anycase we could take over no line while the present offen-sive operations continue.    We suggested that Field Mar-shal Haig and General Petain should themselves come toan arrangement, if possible, as other-wise both Govern-ments might be placed, in an awkward position.    field marshal Haig was informed accordingly and has enteredinto negotiations with General Petain.    He ha* repeated the conditions which should.govern taxing over the line and which he had just mentioned, and had demurred to tak-ing over any line as he thinks he ought to continue the of-fensive in Flanders next spring, and for that he will re-quire all his troops.    General Petain had replied by 3ay-ing that he required more troops in Reserve for defensive purposes, and for the offensive if opportunity offers,and he had asked E&apos;ield Marshal Haig to agree to take overa six-division front as a commencement,    Field MarshalHaig had replied to this that he demurred to taking over any, but that, in order to help General Petain, he would agree to take over a four-division front if our troops onthe northern Coast were relieved by French troops.    he asked the War Cabinet to support him in his refusal to
take over more than a four-division front.    As the matter has recently become mainly political,so far as the Frenchare concerned, it is unlikely that the two Generals willever be able to arrive a* an agreement.    But it is nec-essary to send some reply to Field Marshal Haig, and ifa ICS-the conditions which fee had suggested should govern tak-ing over line are agreed to by the War Cabinet, and aswe have not yet ourselves decided on our future military policy,  it follows that it is hardly consistent to sayno-v whether we should take over a four-division front crmore or less than that.The War Cabinet approved the suggestion of the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff that he should reply toField Marshal Haig in the following sense:-The War Cabinet are of opinion that, in deciding to what extent British troops can take over line from the French, regard must be had to the necessityfor giving them reasonable opportunity for leave,rest, and training during the winter months, and tothe plan of operations for next year; and, further,that while the present offensive continues it wouldnot be possible to commence taking ovef more line.The general military policy for next year is nowunder consideration and mast subsequently form thesubject of a Gohferenoe with the Allied Governments..In these circumstances the War Cabinet feel that un-til this policy is settled it would be premature todecide, finally, whether the British front can be ex-tended by four divisions, or to a greater or lessextent than this.itehall Gardens, S.W.,October 24, 1917.
