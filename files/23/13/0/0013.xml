DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W.,on Friday, August 10, 1917, at 11.30 a.m.tlTARY[CY IKIBSTINEcWith, reference to War Cabinet 191 (a), Minute 8, theChief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, by themiddle of September, General Allenby would hare receivednearly all the artillery he had asked for, excepting the4.5&quot; howitzers which were not yet available, and a few otherpieces; he would also have received 4 out of 5 of the air squadrons asked for.The War Cabinet approved the following instructions toGeneral Allenby submitted to them by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff:-&quot;It is necessary to strike the Turk as hard as pos-sible during the coming Autumn and Winter, since agood success achieved against him will tend to strengthen the moral and staying power of this country during the season when important successes may not be feasiblein Europe and on the other hand it will increase thewar-weariness and general dissatisfaction of the Turkswith their German masters.   In view of the Russian sit-uation the Turks may shortly be free to concentrate the greater part of their forces against you and Maudeand in these circumstances it is not now possible to assign you any geographical objective, and thereforeyour object will be to defeat the Turks opposed to you and to follow up your success as the situation admits.It is important that you should press the Turks oppos-ed to you to the fullest extent of your available re-sources as early as possible in September so as to take   ^advantage of the Arab situation and to relieve pres-sure upon Maude by forcing the enemy to divert troops to Palestine.&quot;a Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 10, 1917.
