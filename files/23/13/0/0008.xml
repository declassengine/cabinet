WAR OABIEBg 198 fal.- &apos; -  &apos;-&apos; &apos;&apos;:&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;.:-&apos;&quot;V&apos;o &apos;.;MI1R7TES of a meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W. , onMonday, July 30, 1917, at 11.30 a.m.-)ERSOUIS        With reference to War Cabinet 196 (a), the War Cab-]0 PARIS.inet had a further short discussion on the question ofMr. Arthur Hendersonrs visit to Paris in company withMr. Ramsay Macdonald and Mr. Wardie.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had raised this question this morning because the PrimeMinister had telephoned to him particularly requesting that he would inform the War Cabinet at the earliestpossible moment that, at the time when he approved the telegram Ho. 715 from Paris on July  5, authorising Mr.Henderson to proceed with the organisation ef an Inter-Ally Socialist Conference in London, he had had no id.eathat this would involve negotiations in Paris, and much less that Mr. Ramsay Macdonald would be one of the part--ies to such negotiations. ^It was generally agreed thatat their meeting on July 26, the bulk of the War Cab-inet had been under the impression that the Prime Min-ister had consented to the visit to Paris.^There wasthen some disctission in regard to the Parliamentarydifficulties that would arise immediately on its beingknown that Mr. Henderson had gone to Paris in company:with Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, and that they had been car-ried in a Government transport.    In this latter connec-tion it was pointed out that the Government transport was practically the only means of crossing the Channelat the present time.The War Cabinet decided that:-If any questions were raised in Parliament as t*Mr. Henderson^ visit to Paris in company with
Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and Mr. Wardle, it shouldbe explained that he had gone as the elected re-presentative of the Labour party  s Executive.    TheGovernment had seen no reason for refusing apassport to Mr. Ramsay Macdonald as he was in thismatter precisely in the same position as Mr. Hen-ders*n and Mr. Wardle, as an elected representa-tive of the Labour party&apos;s Executive.    It couldfurther be pointed out that Mr. Henderson hadbeen secretary of the Labour Partyrs Executivefor very many years, and since assuming office had, with the full knowledge of the Government,retained the post.It was generally agreed that the visit to Paris wasonly a minor incident in a question of much greatermagnitude involving considerations of high policy, name-ly, that of the representation of the Allies at the stockholm Conference.tehall Gardens, S.W.,July 30, 1917.
