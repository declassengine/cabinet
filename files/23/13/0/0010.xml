E .0 RET.WAR CABINET 200 fa)MINUTES of a meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W., on Tuesday,iv   July 31, 1917, at 11.30 a.m.&quot;JTURE POLICY   (1) The War Cabinet discussed the question of general  VIEW OEtXSSIAE&quot; DE-      policy from the point of view more particularly of theELOPMENTS.action to he taken if the military disasters and internaldissensions in Russia should lead to a collapse of Rus-siars military power.    It was^generally agreed that therewas no evidence at present available which would justify an expectation of an immediate debacle, and that therewas still a possibility of a Russian recovery, but itwas felt that the situation was sufficiently serious to necessitate the examination of the problem which might arise some months hence if such recovery should not takeplace oIn this connection the War Cabinet had before them aMemorandum by the Chief of the Imperial C-eneral Staff,dated 29th of July, 1917,  (Paper G.I.1549), and attention was drawn more particularly to the proposals in Paragraph11 of that Memorandum.    (Appendix).It was recognised that the result of a Russian debaclewould be that some portion of the 80 German and 40 Aus-trian divisions (varying according to the extent of the disaster) would be set free for transfer from the Easternto the Western theatre of War; that this would convertour present superiority of force into an inferiority;and that we should no longer be in a position to takethe offensive.It was pointed out that on a merely arithmetical com-parison of the opposing forces the elimination of russia would appear to render the achievement of the war aims of the A-lies,by means of complete victory,very problem-atical.    On the other hand, it was pointed out that there
were many other considerations to be taken into account,for example, the gradual decline of German strength, andthe present condition of Austria, which appeared to bebut little superior to that of Russia.The military recommendations of the Chief of the Im-perial General Staff to meet the eventuality under con-sideration were summed up as follows(i) To reduce our liabilities in the secondary thea-tres and to be prepared, if necessary, even togive ground in them:(ii) To strengthen the Western front with the forcesreleased from the secondary theatres,.in orderthat that vital theatre might be safeguarded:(iii) To do everything possible to strengthen our ship-ping position with a view to a prolonged war.The above proposals were criticised on the groundthat they did not offer sufficient hope of Ultimate vic-tory, and particularly of the recovery of Belgium,to sustain public opinion throughout a prolonged war unlessother measures were taken to support them.    In thisconnection it was pointed out that our military opera-tions would no longer be powerfully supported by theblockade, since its effect would be, to some extent, andprogressively, neutralised by the opening of the Russianfrontier.It was suggested that one method of forestalling thesituation which would be created by the possible elimin-ation of Russia from the War would be to take measuresto reduce the number of our adversaries, in order that,at a later stage, the Allies might concentrate the wholeof their efforts on Germany.    This, it was urged, could probably only be achieved by a readjustment of our war aims, and attention was drawn to the fact that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff had strongly pressed this.Attention was also drawn to the fact that Lord Curzon,when examining the policy to be adopted in view of Rus- . sian
3 odevelopments in May 1917 (Paper G. 1.703), had made thefollowing somewhat similar suggestion:-,TIt is hecoming increasingly clear that the attain-ment of the full terms of the Allies answer to Pres-xdent Wilson in January is not likely to be real-ised; and that a modification of claims on the partof certain of the Allied Powers, and even an abandon-ment of them on the part of others, will be inevit-able.&quot;It was suggested, however, that as a readjustmentof our war aims w&amp;uld not, of itself, be sufficient toproduce the desired result, and that if any of our pres-ent enemies are to be induced to make a separate pes.ce,it will be necessary, before pursuing any negotiations,to inflict a military defeat on them.(2) In the case of Turkey, for example, it was suggestedthat if the British forces in Palestine and Mesopotamiawere sufficiently reinforced, a heavy blow might be struck, and that this might be followed up by the open-ing of negotiations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs indicated that some tentative &quot;feelers&quot; had been put out by cer-tain elements in Turkey, but on Investigation the propo-sals had proved somewhat shadowy.    The matter was htillbeing pursued.The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to keep the door open for a continuance of these negotiations.(3)   Attention was drawn to a report by Mr. Bocock of theForeign Office, in which indications had been given ofa medium for negotiation with Bulgaria if opportunity should arise.    It was generally felt, however, that neg-stiations with Bulgaria could not be taken up with anyprospects of success in the present situation, although there was no reason for closing any channel of communi-cation that might be useful in the future.
(4-  There was also some discussion as to the possibility .of a serious offensive on the Italian front, as contem-plated by the War Cabinet In the decisions in regardto military policy taken as a result of the inquiry bythe Cabinet Committee on War Policy (War Cabinet 191,fa),Minute 2 fc)).    In this connection the War Cabinet were reminded that certain very secret overtures had actually been made from a, very high Austrian quarter, and thatno answer had been sent, because both the British andFrench Governments had felt that the Italians were more concerned than any other Ally, and every indication hadbeen given by the Italian Government that they were notprepared to discuss any terms which Austria could accept.Hence, if opportunity should offer, advantage could stillbe taken of this &apos;medium of communication.    It was sug-gested, however, that before Austria could be broughtinto the frame of mind to agree to terms acceptable toItaly, a blow,involving the capture of Trieste, wouldhave to be struck.The War Cabinet were reminded, however, that in therecent conversations at Paris General Foch had not con-sidered that any Allied concentration on the italian front was likely to be successful unless supported bya Russo-Roumanian attack, which at present was not like-ly to mature.(5)   It was pointed out that in the event of Russia eithermaking a separate peace and becoming of no account froma military point of view, the burden of the war would tend to fall more and more upon the Western Allies andmore particularly on this country.    In fact, it was sug-gested that eventually we might have to contemplate a situation in which the burden of the War was sustainedentirely by the British Empire and the United States ofAmerica. .
-....J JApart from its material importance it was felt thatthe certainty that we could rely on the Unit, ed Statesof America to fight out the War to $he end would provide an immense moral support to the Western Allies.It was generally agreed that the time.had come whendirect and personal communication between the PrimeMinister and the President of the United States of Amer-ica should he established, in order that the government might assure themselves as to the degree of american support on which they could count.Two alternative proposals were made for securing thisobject:-fa.) That President Wilson should be induced to visitEurope.    It was recognised that this would involvedifficulties, including probably those of a con-stitutional character in the United States ofAmerica, but it was felt that this would be themost valuable means of securing the object de-sired, since only by a personal visit could Pres-ident Wilson fully realise the gravity of thesituation and be brought into the atmosphere ofthe War, and no suspicions would be aroused among our Allies that the British Government were en-endeavouring to establish a special position withthe President, since he would, during his visit,no doubt get into personal touch with the Govern-ments of the other Western Allies:fb) That the Prime Minister should make a personalvisit to the United States of America-.The Discussion was adjourned until the following day.la Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 31, 1917.
