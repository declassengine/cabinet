DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street,  S.W.,  on tuesday, May 1,  1917, which commenced at 12.30 p.m. and re-assembled at 3.45 p.m.THE MILITARY (l)    The War Cabinet had a full discussion asPOLICY OF THEALLIES ON THE       to the  attitude to be adopted by the BritishWESTERN FRONT.representatives at the forthcoming Inter-AllyConference at Paris on the subject of theMilitary policy of the Allies on the western front.In this connection they had before them the following documents:-A Memorandum by the C.I.G.S.,  dated 30th-   April,1917.  entitled &quot;Operations on western Front&quot;  attached to which was aNote by Lieut-Gen. Sir H.H.

However this might be the :&quot;.Field Marshal had little doubt that, the FrenchGovernment v/as in control,  and   that their policy was defensive in character.    He considered it   - .would be useless   for him to continue to presshis present offensive vigorously if the French didnot cooperate actively,  and he proposed a modi-fication in his plans to meet this situation.secret war    CABINET    128. a.
The questions raised for decision at the War cabinet were as follows:-(l)    Should the British representatives at the forthcomingAnglo-French Conference press  the French Governmentto pursue the policy of an active offensive?(S)    What attitude should the British representativesadopt if the French should decline to take the offensive,   or,  alternatively,   if they should acceptthe obligation to undertake it,  but how by theirattitude that they did not intend to give full effect to their undertaking?The Prime Minister summed up the sort of arguments which the British representatives might expect to encounter.The French,  he pointed out,  could claim that two very greatGenerals were opposed to the policy of a great offensive,namely,  Generals Alexeieff and Petain.    The former had givenhis opinion that Russia could not undertake any largeoffensive this year,   and consequently the Allies in the Westwould find themselves opposed to the great bulk of the Germanreserves,  and by attacking would exhaust their man-power inan operation offering no prospect of success,  thereby.weakeningtheir offensive capacitor for 1918.    General Petain,   the Frenchcould say,  had accurately forecasted the failure of General Nivelle&apos;.s offensive,   and believed in repeated surprise attacksdesigned on a less ambitious scale.    The French would askwhat prospect there was of a successful offensive on theWestern Front this year.    They would produce figures to showthat the Germans had a superiority in heavy artillery,   and thatin numbers the Allies had no considerable superiority;  in shortthat the superiority of men and material necessary for a successful offensive was lacking.    They would further urge thatthe blockade was telling on the enemy:  that by 1918 the Russiansituation would have cleared up definitely one way or the other,and that the United States of America would be able to puthalf a million men in the field.    Even if the shipping condi-
tions did not enable the American Army to be transported tothe Western Front,   it could be sent to Russia,  where Americanorganisation would by that time have effected improvements in russian transport conditions.    They would advocate that for thepresent our policy on the Western Front should be defensive,and that in the meantime we should use our surplus strength to clear up the situation elsewhere        in Syria,   for example --and to eliminate first Turkey,   then Bulgaria,   and finally,\perhaps,  even Austria from the War.    They wou&amp;d urge that,  if fthe British Generals were confident now,  both they and theFrench Generals had time after time expressed confidence beforeprevious offensives in the West,  which had never yet succeeded.These,   the Prime Minister pointed out,  were considerations which could not lightly be dismissed,  and he felt bound to admit that they made some appeal to him.    Moreover, we couldnot disregard the possibility that in a few months&apos;  time we might be confronted with an insistent demand for peace.    if russia collapsed it would be beyond our power to beat Germany,as the blockade would become to a great extent ineffective,and the whole of the enemies&apos;  forces would Trecome available to oppose the Western Allies.    We could not contemplate withequanimity the prospect of entering a Peace Conference withthe enemy in possession of a large slice of Allied territorybefore we had completed the conquest of Mesopotamia and Syria.General Petain was said to be a very resolute and determinedmen,   and he would be strongly supported by M. Painleve.    Ifthey declined to cooperate they would practically take it outof our power to continue the offensive,   as we could not succeed unless a substantial part of the German reserves were drawn off.  IFinally,  the Prime Minister reminded the WarCabinet that we had no reserve of man-power sufficient to sus- &quot;tain a combat with the bulk of the German reserves until theUnited States of America could bring their strength to bear.-   -3-
He reminded the War Cabinet that, to maintain our shipping atthe barest minimum required to sustain the War we required totrealise a building programme of 3 million gross tons,  and wecould not afford that men should be recruited from this orfrom the connected trades.    Shipping was at present our weak-est flank,  and we could not afford to take men from ship-building.    On the contrary,  he had almost come to the conclusion,as the result of his inquiries during the past week,   that weshould be obliged to withdraw men from the Army for this purpose.In stating the case as above against the continuation of ouroffensive in the West,   the Prime Minister made it clear thathe was not himself committed to the arguments that he had ex-pressed,   but he considered th  they required earnest considera-ti on . JV .Against the above arguments it was pointed out that,  ifthe Allies contented themselves with a defensive policy in theWest,   or with the policy of small offensives generally attri-buted to General Petain,  which the Chief of the General staff and General Smuts characterised as equivalent to a defensivepolicy,   the Germans would be able to release reserves for operations against Russia or Italy.    Russia,   it was generally agreed,  was the weak point of the Alliance,  but some difference of opinion was expressed as to whether the effect of a german offensive against Russia would be advantageous or the reverse.One view was that an attack might stiffen the Russian resistanceand pull the whole nation together;  the other was that a decisive defeat and heavy losses would bring about a completecollapse.    Even admitting that the Allies had not much chance&apos;of breaking the German line this year,  it was urged,  neverthe-less,  that by continuing to hammer the enemy we might bring them to a frame of mind in which they would agree to a peace
on terms acceptable to the Allies.    In this connection it waspointed out the Germany would probably reach almost the lowest point of depression and misery between now and the nextharvest.    The Allies,   on the other hand,  were still capable ofmaking a great military effort.    Later on,  after a long con-tinuance of submarine losses,   though we probably should notbe starved,  we should be compelled,   in order to supply theessential needs of the nation,   to withdraw shipping from mili-tary purposes and consequently to reduce our military effort.To desist now would be to lose the moment when our own force was at a maximum and when the enemy&apos;s anxieties were most acute.It was further suggested that to relinquish our efforts at thisperiod of the War would be to deal a fatal blow^at the moral ofthe Allies.    In this connection it was pointed out that theFrench Socialists had rejected the invitation to an InternationalSocialist Conference at Stockholm,   to be attended by GermanSocialists,  and summoned in the interests of peace,  by only two votes.General Smuts was very insistent on the moral aspect ofthe question.    He considered that to relinquish the offensive in the third year of the War would be fatal,  and would be thebeginning of the end.    It would be impossible to keep up thespirits of the people and pessimism and despair would be rifeamong the Allies,  while the Germans would be correspondinglycheered,  and would have time to recover their spirits.    he did not foresee any likelihood of our breaking the German line,but by remorselessly hammering away we might expect ultimately to bring the enemy to terms.    If we could not break the enemy&apos;sfront we might break his heart.    It was hard on us and wouldinvolve heavy casualties,  but,   though it was a great mis-fortune,   the Western Front was our problem and it could onlybe solved by this policy.    For replacing losses we must rely&apos; &apos; -5-..
ultimately on the United States of America,  but to delay actionI until the United States could bring their strength to bear,that is to say until the year 1918,  might be/disastrouspolicy.    Even if the French refused to take the offensive,  we ought to be prepared to continue,  and should insist on theFrench taking over the section of the line recently occupiedby us to enable General Nivelle to take the offensive.Moreover, General Smuts assumed that the French would not&quot;remain entirely passive in any case.    He considered that from a purely British point of view it would be better toattack in Flanders, where very important objects of british policy were to be achieved,   in order to leave to the Frenchthe incentive to clear the enemy from France,  an incentivewhich would be lacking if the recent operations had resultedin driving the enemy across the Meuse.The First Sea Lord pointed out that shipping might prove the decisive factor and undertook to investigate thetransport facilities likely to be available to the UnitedStates in 1918.On a review of the foregoing considerations the V/war cabinet  decided:-(l)    That the British representatives at the conference should press the French to continue the offensive;(3)    If,  after hearing General Petain&apos;s views or after a conference between the Chief of the. Imperial.General Staff and General Petain,   they were not satisfied -that the French offensive would proveeffective,   they should insist on our entire freedomof action and on the French Array reoccupjring the trenches recently taken over by the British forces.^BALKANS.  (2)    The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion as to theattitude to be adopted by the British delegates at theforthcoming Conference in regard to the questions of greece and Salonica.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that hehad circulated his views in a Memorandum which, however,- 6 - i&apos;eece andiLonica.
the majority of the War Cabinet had not as yet had time to read.    The policy he advocated was gradually to withdraw to the position covering Salonica and immediately to takeaway two Cavalry Brigades and one division;  also to have nothing whatsoever to do with any action that might leadto political trouble in Greece.It was pointed out,  however,   that it would be extremelydifficult for the British delegates to disconnect thewithdrawal of troops from the Balkans from the question ofFrench policy in Greece.    It was pointed out that theFrench Government are intensely concerned in affairs in greece.    There was some difference to opinion as to the motives of the French Government,   one view being that theirpolicy was to gain such an ascendancy in Greece as to enablethem to establish a Protectorate there after the War,   theother view being that there was a feeling in France&apos;that king Constantine had been retained on his throne to the detriment of the Allied cause by the Monarchies of Europe.In this connection,  however,  it was pointed out that at  theConference at St. Jean de Maurienne the French had agreedthat if King Constantine were removed the Constitution of greece should not be altered.The Prime Minister pointed out that the British dele-gates would be in rather a difficult position in Paris ifthey had to insist on the withdrawal of our forces from Salonica,   on whose presence the French had always laid somuch stress,  but were unable to offer any compensation to  theFrench Government.    Probably the most acceptable compensa-tion to France would be a free hand to deal with King Constantine as she thought fit.It was pointed out,  however,   that it would be very
difficult to dissociate ourselves from French policy in greece.    If,   for example,   General Sarrail employed partof the French forces with the object.of dethroning King Constantine,   it might expose the Allied Army in the Balkansto danger from the Central Powers,   and the result would bethat instead of withdrawing our forces from the Balkans weshould be compelled to retain them there for defensive pur-poses.    Moreover,   the view was expressed that there    was no particular reason why we should compensate the French forwithdrawing from Salonica,   seeing that for many months wehad maintained a force of over 200,000 men against ourbetter judgment and solely&apos;to meet the French views.    On theother hand,   it was pointed out that our forces at Salonicahad never been sufficiently equipped to enable them to undertake the offensive with any prospects of success,   althoughthe French were equally to blame in this respect.The question was adjourned for discussion on thefollowing day at the Imperial War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.w.May 2nd. 1917.
