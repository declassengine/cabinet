(This Document is the Property of His BritannicMajesty1s Government).I.....C R E T.WAR CABINET 282a,DpA.PT MI MUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W.on MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1917, at 10.30 a.m.TUBE With reference to War Cabinet  81, Minute IS,  the WarJLITARYJLICY. Cabinet had a discussion among themselves on the questionof Future Military Policy.    In this connection they had before them:-.A Memorandum by the Chief of the Imoerial -GeneralStaff (W.P.68):A letter from Pield Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to theChief of the Imperial General Staff,  dated loth IIov,1017;   (W.PA5):A Memorandum by Mr.  Sal four , dated 24-th November, 1917:A Memorandum by the Shipping Controller entitled &quot;TheShipping Situation and American Assistance&quot; (G..T.2728):A Memorandum by the Minister of National Service (0.174):A Memorandum on the Question of shipping for the Imer-ican ,-.rmy by Sir Guy Granet, forwarded by the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff (3.2.2755):and various Memoranda of recent date dealing with thesituation in various theatres of war.It was generally agreed that no attempt should be madeto pre-judge the question of our Future Military Policy,for  the examination of which the supreme War Council, withits Permanent Military Advisers, had been specially setup.    The Prime Minister, however,  explained that he wishedto have some idea of the views of his colleagues beforethe Meeting of the Supreme ...sr Council to be held at theend of this week.No decisions were taken, but the trend of the discussion was somewhat in the following sense:-1.
15 G(1)  It appeared probable that the war was more likelyto end by the general collapse of sane of the belligor-ents rather than by complete military overthrow.    It was,therefore, necessary to ensure, as far as possible,  thattec allies should have the aowor of continuing the ,Varinto 1919:(2)  The first essential in the staying-power and inthe roil maintenance of the military forces of the Alliesis a sufficient supply of shioping:(5)  Shipbuilding should have preoeden.ee in regard  toman-power,  even over fighting services:(4)  The various measures auggested by the Director ofRational Service for Increasing the supply of men to theArmy are,  in the main, not practicable at the presenttime.    In regard to the particular measures,  the follow-ing views were expressed and generally agreed to:-(a) The proposal to lower the age at which men are called up for Service would not be acceptable to Parliament and is generally inadvisable:(b) It is probable that Parliament would not consent to raise the military age to 50.    It is possiblethat Parliament might consent to raise the age to 45, but it is doubtful whether the numbers which could be raised for General Service fromthis source, namely, 50,000 men,  justify the taking of this step:(d) Recent experience does not encourage the hopethat the country would accept a general &quot;combout&quot; of workers in munitions works and other es-sentisl war trades:(d)  The application of Conscription to Ireland,though eminently desirable, would be extremelydifficult to carry out at the present time. Itmight involve an increase in tae military gar-rison out of proportion to the advantage to beobtained. It would be inadvisable to introducethis measure while there Is any nope of a satis-factory result to the Convention:(5) Whatever policy might be formed, for neat year, it was-possible, and perhaps probable,  that the enemy might die-locate it by his own operations.
6.  It was desirable - that- these --oonsiderations shouldbe present in the minds of the Supreme &apos;.Var Council and ofthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff in considering our future policy.Whitehall Gardens, B.wi/.November 26, 1917.3,
