WAR CABINET 316 A.

Minutes of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W. on Monday, January 7th, 1918, at 12 noon.



THE WESTERN FRONT.



? of the British time.

1. With reference to War Cabinet 305, Minute 4, the Prime Minister stated that he had received further communications from M. Clemenceau with regard to the extension of the British Front in France.   M. Clemenceau evidently seemed dissatisfied with the way in which the subject stood at present.

Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig stated that he proposed to take over a two-Divisional front from the French in a fewdays&apos; time, and a further two-Divisional front by the end of the month, which would involve our right flank resting upon the River Oise. General Potain seemed to be quite satisfied with this arrangement, and correspondence had passed on the subject between the two Commanders-in-Chief.

Lord Milner stated that he understood that M. Clemenceau wanted the matter settled not merely by the Commander-in-Chief but by the two Governments.

Sir Douglas Haig thought that there was something further in the minds of the French Government; they were apprehensive lest a big German attack would be made against in the French lines, and wanted the question of a still further extension of the British Front considered.

Lord Milner stated that a study of the matter was being made at Versailles.

Captain Amory reported that all Sections had put in reports upon the subject, which would be ready for the consideration of the Cabinets by the end of that week. Captain Amery added that ho had seen General Caderna&apos;s report, which concluded with a suggestion that our line should be extended to a point somewhere between Berry-au-Bac.

The




The Prime Minister pointed out that it was impossible to settle this question until there had been a full discussion with our Allies of our future military policy for the Year 1918.   The situation was not fairly clearly defined, and it should be possible to arrive at an agreement.   He gathered that M. Clemenceau still persisted in the suggestion that the British had not been and were not doing their share, whereas it was common knowledge that the brunt of the fighting in 1917 had been borne by the British, thus enabling the French Army to recover. A similar attitude to that adopted by M.Clemenceau was being spread in the American newspapers, largely by M.Tardieu.

Sir Douglas Haig added that he had issued instructions for carrying out all that General Potain had requested him to do, and that it was impossible for him to do more with the troops at present in France without incurring grave risk.

The War Cabinet instructed:-

The Secretary to draft a telegram (Appendix) for the Prime Minister to send to M.Clemenceau, in the sense that the question of the extension of the line should be considered as part of the question of general military policy,

and directed that :-

A copy of this telegram should be sent to the British Military Adviser to the Supreme War Council at Versailles, asking him to submit reports for their guidance at the earliest possible date.

Situation in the British Front.

2.  Sir Edward Carson asked Sir Douglas Haig whether, in his opinion, it would be possible for the Germans to break through our lines in France in the near future.

Sir Douglas Haig replied that nothing was certain in war. A long-continued offensive by the Germans would use up all our present reserves, and our losses would continue to be heavy; but, after consultation with his Army Commanders, he was satisfied that the condition and moral of the British


British Army was such as to give him every confidence thatthe British Army would hold its own, as it had always donein the past, hut it was essential that Divisions be kept upto strength, and adequate reserves provided to oppose a sustained hostile attack .Sir Edvrard Carson added that he gathered from thereport on the recent actions in the qamoral sector that theBerman successes were due , in part , to the Inability of ourMachine Gun Corps to hold the German attack .   A number ofthe officers were young and inexperienced in defensive war-fare , and he would be glad to know whether there was a dangerof something similar happening on other sectors of the Front.Sir Douglas Haig replied that he did not feel appre-hension upon this point .   The situation at Cambrai had been somewhat unique in character , owing to the sudden change froman offensive to a defensive situation .   Thus the troops onthe spot were confronted with the necessity of employingdefensive tactics when all their thoughts and actions hadbeen directed to an offensive operation.   He had recommended the appointment of extra officers to the Machine Gun Corps , andefforts were being made to work out defensive plans in detailon every section of our Front,    The German machine-gunnerswere a Corps d!Elito, consisting of picked officers and menwho fought to the death after the Infantry had retired .During our offensives the Germans had had long experienceof the defensive employment of machine-guns .The Prime Minister asked whether steps had been takento make our Machine Gun Corps similar to the German.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff replied thatthis was being done , and every effort was made to inspirethis arm with the highest degree of efficiency and moral.
eral Mill- ( &amp; ) Sir Edward Carson asked Sir Douglas Haig whethery situation.he thought that the military position in 6 or 12 monthstime would shew improvement from our point of view.Sir Douglas Haig replied that he had not the factBcr figures upon which to base a reply to this generaJL.. que-stion.    He had not seen the Report of the Cabinet Committeeon Hair-Power\ and, from his point of view, much depended upon whether his units could be kept up to establishment.The Prime Minister directed that:-Sir Douglas Haig should bo shown a copyof the Report of the Man-Power Committee.rican (4 ) With reference to War Cabinet 307, Minute 4, and initaryistance. reply to a question regarding the possible co-operation of american and British, troops, Sir Douglas Haig stated thatGeneral Pershing appeared to be somewhat slow in the pre-paration of Staffs and training for the American Divisionsnow in Prance.    He had, however, agreed with General Per-shing to the establishment of a Training Camp in the Britisharea near Amiens, to which British and American troops shouldbe sent.    His proposal was that a certain number of british divisions should be gradually Americanised.     He gathered from General Pershing that the Americans in Prance were anxious to co-operate with and to join the British Army,but that the American people ih the United States were still anxious that the Americans should co-operate withthe French rather than with the British.   The french authorities had always taken the line that the americans were to be regarded as being primarily disposed for assis-ting the French rather than the British, and thereforehe had not thought fit to press suggestions upon the americans.Mr. Bonar Law stated that it had been reported to him that General Pershing was most anxious to have a consulta-tion with Sir Douglas Haig and General Petain together.
-6- 18iLord Curzon pointed out that tho Restriction of ImportsCommittee bed boon considering a proposal for the cutting down of imports during the earlier part of this year, with10 viev. to utilising more ships in the transport of American/ Man-power to France.The Chief of tho Imperial  onoral Staff stated thathe was going over to Franco on the following day to see general Porshing with a view to discussing the whole ques-tion with him.Tho Prime Minister expressed the view that it wouldbe desirable that General Pershing should meet the membersof the Supreme War Council and thoir Advisers at the comingConference at Versailles.Captain Amery stated that ho understood that GeneralBliss was attending on behalf of the Americans *3PA2A- (:S ) With reference to Sir Douglas Kaigvs Report (PaperMl OF(J.2..-3211),  the Prime Minister stated that he attached theutmost importance to the preparation of adequate defensivelines in case of a German attack.    Ho wished to draw parfci-cular attention to two points in their preparation--(a) Tho fortif? nation of the lines with aview to their being held:(b) The construction of &quot;pill--boxes&quot; , dugouts,etc,, for tho purpose of saving life -v/e were now near lag the end of our resources in Man-power,and it was essential that wo should use our remainingreserves with the utmost economy,    It therefore behoved usto  examine the German methods far   mo tenting their troops from the effect of artillery bombardment, and so to do allthat was possible to minimise our losso8 beforo and during a German attack.     He gathered that the line now bei ng heldby the British troops was very largely a new line, and thatit would be necessary to construct new Tories, whether ofearth or concrete,  on that line,  as woll as to maintainthe old linos upon which we could fall back if compelled
to do so.      He knew that it was difficult to get into the minds of the rank and file of the troops who had been Tali-ant ly and successfully advancing from one position to anothei&quot;,the idea that it was necessary to devote more attention todigging and protection.Sir Edward Carson added that,.if this War was to go on,it was essential that we should save men.Sir Douglas Baig pointed out the position of the Britishlines upon a map, and stated that he had given orders for thepreparation of defensive positions in depth and the improvementof our trench systems.      In certain areas it was not possible todig deep dugouts, owing to the prevalence cf waterlogged ground.Wihn regard to &quot;pill-boxes&quot;, we should be able to utilisea certain number of those taken from the Germans, but theconstruction of &quot;pill-boxes&quot; was rendered difficult owing tothe great quantity of material required, namely, ten tons forone man.       The whole difficulty presented to him was one oflabour..    If he had more men to construct defences, the lattercould be still further improved.     He had re-organised thesystem of working-parties, with a view to avoiding loss oftime, and was continually advised regarding the state of the defensive works &quot;by his Engineer-in-Chief, General Heath.This officer had experienced Engineer Officers in all sectors of the Front, who reported to him how the work was proceeding.Sir Douglas Haig explained the system whereby responsibilityfor the proper mairjiBnar.ce of defences was delegated to theArmy Corps Commanders in each particular sector, who wereadvised by the Royal Engineer s upon the technical aspectsof the work.      He gathered that the French had not kept up their defensive lines as well as we had. and that there was great need for their improvement.Lord&apos;Derby stated that he was sending out on a temporarily-ary mission to Sir Douglas Haig an experiencedCivil Engineer
for the purpose of advising whether new labour-savingdevices and machinery could be employed upon the construction and improvement of defences . He also hoped that it might bepossible to obtain some Labour Companies from Italy for assisting in the work.Sir Douglas Haig added that a new edition of GeneralIns true ti ons regarding- - the-, preparaJbien^f*Itef^n-oes-.s!a^ about to be issued to all concerned,  and he would embody in thisaboveissue the two specific points emphasised/by the Prime Minister *INSPECTS        (66&apos;      Mr. Bonar Law asked Sir Douglas Haig the following a GERM AITFS1TSIVE.  questions:-    &quot;If you were a German Commander,  would you think there was a sufficient chance of a smashing offensive tojustify incurring the losses which would be entailed&quot;?Sir Douglas Haig replied that it seemed to him thatthere were two ways of effecting victory in War.(a) By destroying the moral of the enemy&apos;s Army:(b) By destroying the moral of the enemy peopleby      attacks of limited scope,   such as againstChalons,  Arras or some  salient.    The latterseemed to him to be the more probable course for the enemy to adept, because an offensive ona large scale made with the object of piercingthe front and reaching Calais or Paris for instance,would be very costly.    Moreover the German Ian-Power situation did not seem very satisfactory:he had about one million Reserve for the wholeof the coming year.. - If he attacked and failedhis position would become critical in view of the increasing forces of the Allies in August.    Butthis view should make no difference to our countermeasures to meet the enemy&apos;s attacks.   He was taking no chances and was making every prepara-tion in case the much-advertised offensive materia-lised.    We must expect to be seriously attacked,to be pressed back in places,   to lose ground,  andalso guns possibly,  but he felt confident of holding hi3 fiont provided his Divisions were maintained at proper strength.He also stated that based on the enemy&apos;slosses in the Somme battle,  we must be pre-pared to replace casualties at least as large as this year,  viz.,  about 100,000 a month.    for it is possible that the enemy may start with acertain number of surprise attacks against theFrench and ourselves and if successful will besure to follow them up with other attacks.    Thiscontinuous fighting must of course result insevere losses to our forces.
1 p w10 *He was somewhat apprehensive of the effect of German propa-ganda in the Belgian Army,   and thought that this matter should he drawn to the attention of the Government.Lore, Robert Cecil added that he had evidence of con-.rsiderable dissatisfaction among the Belgians in London.CAVALRY. (7)    The War Cabinet invited the views of Sir douglas haig in regard to the une of Cavalry.Sir Douglas Haig stated that he considered the value and importance of the Cavalry to be very great not only inoffensive but also in defensive operations.    This was due totheir superior mobility and the ease with which Cavalry couldbe moved from one scctpr to another and then used dismounted.He pointed out that the British Cavalry resembled highly-trained mobile Infantry rather than the old Cavalry arm.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Cavalryquestion vitally affected shipping,  and that,   in view ofthe shortage of shipping, he hoped that every effort v?ould be mo.de to economise the requirements of our Army in thematter of horses and their maintenance.    It would be mosthelpful if some of the ship3 now utilised in the transportof horses ana hay could be used for the purpose of bringingover American troops.Lord Curzon added that it would appear that thecharacter of warfare during the ensuing few months would present fewer opportunities for the use of Cavalry.Sir Douglas Haig stated that once the Cavalry hadbeen disbanded it would be very difficult to build up againso highly-trained and technical an arm,  and it would requiremany months before the Cavalry,   once dissipated,   could bere-created,POPS FOR (8)    The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on W DEFENCE.the subject of the troops required for Home Defence (Paper&apos;G.T; 3212)  by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.    The
,  Whitehall Gardens,   S.W.7th January,  1918,the Admiralty and the War Office upon the auhjeci^--aj3d*-43iafc..the matter was now submitted, -for the conoaideruutjum. and decision of the War Cabinet.    The risk to be taken, ist -betaken by the Government as it was. not possible for either the Admiralty or the War &quot;Office alone to take the riskentailed.The First Sea Lord stated that too much -importanceshould not he attached to the question of the number ofmen which the Germans might or might not be able to bring to our shores,    The matter had to be examined from a broadpoint of view,  and in his opinion the risk for the enemy was such that he advised the Cabinet to take the responsi-bility of reducing the number of mobile troops retained for none Defence,   a3 suggested,Sir Sric Geddes agreed&quot; with the view put forward by the First Sea Lord,  and added that the matter couldnot be considered as a purely ITaval one. -  It might bre from 36 to 48 hours before the Grand Fleet or a Navaldetachment could reach the threatened point on our coasts,but,  given the adequate shore defences,  ho thought thatthe risk of invasion was small.The War Cabinet decided:-T* take the risk of reducing the forces allocated to Home Defence to such strength as would deteran enemy force up to 30,000 men from attemptinga landing in this country,  and they authorised the Army Council to make the reductions in  mestrength of the Home Defence force indicated inthe Memorandum by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff (paper G.T. 3212.
W,C.  316.A.APKSSDIX.Paraphrase of Telegram Ho. 42 to Lord Bertie (Paris).Foreign Office, January 7,1918,    7 p.m.The following personal message from the Prime Minister toM. Clemenceau :-I consider it advisable that the next Meeting of theSupreme TiFar Council should bo postponed until the further reports from the Permanent Military Advisers have been receixred and beenconsidered by the several Governments.      This should not meanmore than a week or ten days delay.      fit this moment I do notthink there is any need for a discussion &quot;between the AlliedGovernments on the question of the negotiations at Brest-LitDvsk,though it may turn out that such a discussion will be necessitatedlater.Practically all the outstanding questions turn on thedecision to be taken on the broad lines of our future military policy.      I recognise that from the French point of view one ofthe most urgent of these questions is that of the extension of theBritish line,  and I understand that the Permanent military advisers are now considering their report.      The taking over ofa portion of the French line already agreed to between general petain and Field-Marshal Haig is about to commence;    we should,in the meantime,  ask the Permanent Military Advisers to hasten thecompletion of their reports, both on the question of taking overthe line and of the general military policy.General Wilson has been communicated with in this sense.Instructions have been given to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inParis&apos; to send a copy of this telegram to the British section at versailles.
