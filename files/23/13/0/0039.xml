This had created a serious sit-us.tion for the Government, and he had felt it his dutybefore consulting his colleagues, to seek an audiencewith the King.    The Prime Minister then briefly re-hearsed the recent course of events.    He pointed outthat he himself and the War Cabinet had made every possible concession to General Sir William Robertsonconsistently with adherence to the recent decisions ofthe Supreme War Council.    General Robertson, however,had not yielded as inch.    The ner.t twelve months wouldbe a period of very great difficulty.    He himself didnot wish to shirk difficulties, but before facing themhe wished to be assured, of the confidence of the king and of his colleagues.    In these circumstances, he had felt it his duty to inform the King that he could not continue to be responsible unless he and his colleage--ues were free to take the measures they considered necessary to meet the situation,,The Prime Minister then suggested to his colleage-ues that the following action, which His Majesty theKing had approved of, should be taken:-.(1) General Sir William Robertson should be given a final opportunity to accept, either the post of permanent Military Representative at Ver-sailles or of Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff under the new conditions.    The Prime Min-ister to make this offer to him personally:
( ) If General Sobertson refused, General Sir henry wilson should, &quot;be appointed as Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff on the amended conditions:(3) Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig (who, Lord Derby saidwas ooming to England this evening)  should he seen by the.Prime Minister and consulted as to the mostsuitable Officer to appoint as British Permanent Mil-itary ^Representative at Versailles.    The reason forthis proposal was that the British Permanent Milit-ary Representative would necessarily have to be in very close touch with Pield Marshal Haig;(4) 3*a&amp;3T  he Bar Cabinet should do their utmost to meetiks: Field Marshal Sir Douglas HaigT s wishes in re- -gard to this appointment.To a question by the Secretary of State for War as to whether-er Field Marshal Eaig would also be consulted as to the re-lations between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff andthe Permanent Military Representative at Versailles,  the PrimeMinister, with the general assent of his colleagues, repliedin the negative.    This would reopen the whole question, whichit was generally agreed was inadvisable, as the Represents-fives of the Government had accepted the scheme for the controlof the Reserves at Versailles, and their decision had been con-firmed by the War Cabinet.It was generally agreed also.that, .in the event of Gener-al Hobertsoniisi refusing either post, an announcement of his resignation and General Wilson1s appointment should be madewith the least possible delay.It was agreed that there was no necessity to refer in theannouncement to the offer to General Sir Herbert Plumer, as there was no precedent for such action.The question was discussed as to what action should be fak-en if Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig should withdraw the as-sent he had given last Saturday to the arrangements no?; propos-ed to govern the relations between the Army Council and thePermanent Military Representative at Versailles, and particu-larly if he should press 1m. his objections to the point of ,resignation.    The Prime Minister had the full support of hisoolleagues in the view that, in such an eventuality, he wouldbe right at once to refuse to accept Field Marshal HaigTsy    .        /fj;:h-n;^
&amp;resignation. 1The Secretary of State for War pointed out that he was ina position of particular difficulty.    Under the new arrange-ments greater responsibility would be thrown on to him, inso-much as the responsibilities of the Chief of the Imperial Gen-eral Staff would be reduced, under the new arrangements.    Inthese circumstances he had felt very great reluctance in oon-senting to the idea of accepting General Robertson1s resigna-tion, which he had done his utmost to avert.    His object wasto secure the services of an Officer as Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff who had the confidence of the Prime Ministerand the War Cabinet, of himself, and of the Army.    All these requirements were fully satisfied by General Robertson.    when general Sir Herbert Plumer, who also fulfilled these condi-tions, had declined the post sJ: on precisely the same groundsas the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, his misgivingswere greatly increased.    He felt it would be necessary very carefully to consider his position.After some further discussion, the War Cabinet decidedthat:-(1) The Prime Minister should at once see General Sir Wil-iam Robertson and make him a final offer of the choice of the appointments of Permanent Military representatives-tive to the Supreme War Council, or of Chief of theImperial General Staff under the new conditions:(S)  If General Robertson refused, General Sir Henry Wilsonshould be appointed as Chief of the Imperial General*   Staff:(2) An immediate announcement of General Robertson1s resig-nation and General Wilsonfs appointment should be madein the terms of the draft in the Appendix;(4) In the event of these changes taking place, the PrimeMinister should see Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig onthe following day, and consult him as to the most suit-able successor to General Wilson at Versailles:(5) That, in view of the state of the Prime Ministershealth, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should seek toarrange that the Parliamentary discussion in regard tothese changes should not take place before Tuesday.4      *     *hltehall Gardens, S.W.,Feb. 16, 1918.3 9

16th February 1918.

Dear Prime Minister.

I desire to express my thanks for the appreciative words you saw fit to say to me this morning. I have considered the appeal you made to me to endeavour to acquiesce in the system of controlling the Reserves, by which the C.I.G.S., is not on the Executive Committee. Indeed I have considered the same question over and over again during the last fortnight. I deeply regret to say that my conscience will not allow me to depart from the views I expressed to the Cabinet on Thursday last, and in the various papers you had previously seen.

It is a matter of real concern to me that you cannot see your way to adopt the method I have ventured to advise for carrying out your policy in this matter, for I still feel that the method you have decided to adopt must prove unworkable and dangerous. Believe me, it is with the deepest regret that I cannot send you any other reply to your kind personal appeal.

Yours sincerely,

Signed, W. Robertson.
