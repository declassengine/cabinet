Amery, M.P., Assistant SecretaryAUSTRIAN PEACE The War Cabinet discussed certain tentative approachesOVERTURES.recently made in Christiania &quot;by persons professing tobe accredited Austrian agents, .with a view to a possibleseparate peace between Austria-Hungary and the Allies.(See telegrams of 17th December and 10th January andletter of 10th January from the British Minister inChristiania. )The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated thatthere were various indications that Austria was anxiousto negotiate for peace.    Recent ministerial changespointed to a desire on the part of the new Emperor to
emancipate himself from German control,  and the forth-coming changes in the Austro-Hungarian representation at the Hague and in Berne were also significant.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave hisopinion that a separate peace with Austria would be adecided advantage from the military point of view.    Itwould eliminate 47 Austro-Hungarian divisions now on theEastern front,  and set free 149 Russian divisions to dealwith 78 German divisions now .on the Eastern front.    Itwould alsgo remove the submarine menace in the Adriatic.These advantages would more than counterbalance the poss-responsibility of Italy withdrawing from active participation in the war.    The Minister for Blockade admitted thatsuch a peace would make the blockade situation more dif-difficult, but thought that the shortage of shipping wouldenable us to prevent any substantial supplies reachingGermany through Austria.The War Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should informally indicate to the AlliedAmbassadors in London that,  in the event of tentativeapproaches being made to us, we proposed, unless theysa^y any objection,  to probe these up to the pointof ascertaining whether any real offer was intended.   Hewas, however, to make it quite clear that no actual neg-negotiations would be entered upon without consultation withour Allies.If no objection were raised the next step would beto inform the persons who had approached the British Min-ister in Christiania that their present suggestions werenot couched in a form, and did not emanate from a quarterwhich appeared to promise any very definite results,  andthat we should want a much more precise statement of the
conditions under which itand an indication of morehad yet &quot;been put forward.was proposed to negotiateresponsible intermediary than(Initialled)    D.L1.G.Whitehall Gardens,    S.Jan. 18,  1917.
