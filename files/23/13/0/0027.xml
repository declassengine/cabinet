WAR CABINET 259a.

DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting hold at 10 Downing Street, S.W., on TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1917, at 12.30 p.m.



GENERAL MILITARY POLICY.



The Proposed In?er-Allied Council and Military Staff.

 

 With reference to War Cabinet 257a,  the War Cabinet had before them the reports prepared at their request by Field Marshal Lord French (W.P.60) and Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Wilson (W.P.61), together with comments by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (W.P.62).

 The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he had received a message that M. Painleve was arriving that afternoon and wished to see him at 7 o&apos;clock. He had no doubt that the object of M.  Painleve&apos;s visit was to induce  the British Government to take over part of the French line. He wished to consult his colleagues as to the line he was to take. His own view was that the War Cabinet are not in a position to decide. It was first necessary to make a complete examination, in conjunction with our Allies,  of the factors bearing on next year&apos;s operations. In a military sense he felt that we were being out-manoeuvred and beaten by an enemy who was inferior in material and personnel, though possessing the advantage of an interior position. Every year the enemy succeeded in ending up his campaign with a great success and in improving his economic position thereby. In this connection there was no use in underrating the importance of the recent success against Italy. He himself, from his experience of manufacturing munitions, knew that the loss of 1,500 guns was most serious and would, set the cause of the Allies back a year.    It was only necessary to consider how valuable the reinforcement of 1,500 guns would be to Sir Douglas Haig.


Ke cfculd not help thinking that these set-backs were dueto the fact that the situation was never considered as awhole.    The Conferences we had with our lilies, which had lately increased in number, were not really Conferences.They were only meetings of people with preconceived ideaswho desired to find a formula which would -reonncJJ-a-4Iuxm.In fact, Conferences were really a &quot;tailoring&apos;4 operation atwhich different plans were stitched together.    He,  therefore,felt ha sure that the advice given by Held Marshal lord french and General sir henry Wilson was sound, namely,  thatthere should be an Inter-Allied General Staff.    Its functions would not be to give orders,    ho Government could concede the right to issue orders, but their dtities would be to er-a mine the military situation of the Allies and of ourselvesas a whole.    For example,  there was no doubt that, at thepresent time, the Italians were only interested in theirown front, and the same applied, to a certain extent, to theFrench.    ho one was thinking out the whole plan as though he were responsible for the whole of the battle-front ofthe Allies.    In order to achieve success the War ought to be conducted as though there were one man sitting In the centrewith equal responsibility for all the fronts, who could de-decide where to hit and where to hold and which part of theline required strengthening according to the information at his disposal as regards the enemy,  the value of the dif-ferent troops, and of their equipment, &amp;c.What we required was to create, for the first time, a realInter-Allied General Staff,  to examine the situation as awhole and to advise,without divesting the Governments or their General staffs of their responsibility.    This Inter-Allied General Staff would examine the situation after re-ceiving the plans of the different Commands, and would, thensuggest the action that ought to be taken.    In his view thispermanent and independent body should be located in London,which would be more convenient for, and probably preferredby,  the United States of America, the Prussians, and the
Italians.    It was essential that this Inter-Allied GeneralStaff should he an entirely independent body, not consist-ing of representatives of the National General Staffs, asin that case each representative would simply fight for theviews of his own General Staff,He asked the War Cabinet to allow him to make this propo-sal to M. Painleve, and at the same time to refuse the french proposal to take over more of the line until the plans for next year had been settled after hearing the advice of theInter-Allied General Staff,In reply to Lord Curzon, the Prime Minister explainedthat the British representative or! the xxx Inter-allied general Staff would be independent of the War Office GeneralStaff;    that the Inter-Allied General Staff would work onplans formulated by the. various National General Staffs, andthat their recommendations would reach the War Cabinetthrough the War Office General Staff.Mr. Balfour, while concurring in the general conception,pointed out some of the difficulties involved in carryingout the proposal.    For example, in order to criticize the plans put forward by the Italian Supreme Command it, wouldbe necessary to obtain Italian witnesses and to cross-examinethem.    A good deal of friction might be involved in the cross-examination of experts from the various War Offices.He was not clear that the proposal would get over the dif-ficulty that the British and French Staffs each ratio  separateplans which, at present, were only stitched together.    Itappeared to him that this process might continue even whenthe now Inter-Allied General Staff was set up.    The oonse-quence would be that they would be always coming to their governments to solve their own difficulties.    Consider, forexample,  the case of artillery.    It is notorious that thereis a far larger proportion of heavy artillery on the British
5 &apos; i c.1   J1   Onthan on the Italian front.    The logical action to take wouldbe to transfer artillery from the British to the italian and infantry from the Italian to the British front.    The ob-jection to this course was that the enemy so often capturedartillery from some of our Allies. . This, however, was a consideration which could not bo taken into account or dis-oussed by the proposed Inter-Allied General Staff.    In his view our main misfortunes had not been due to lack of coord-Inter- Alliedmat!on so much as to political causes which the (2 sktas3icCouncil could neither have foreseen nor provided against.This was certainly true of the husfeian debacle and, to someextent, was also true of the Italian debacle.Lord Derby said that he would like to reserve for furthert^^^rwa^p^nsideration the military aspects of the proposal whichz *^C- ^^^^-depended, to a considerable extent, uponJporeoralitioc .    In&apos;^U* ^is view the political aspects of the. question were mostimportant.-s-^-y-yy.,-   In the course of the subsequent discussion It was pointedout that the Inter-Alliod General Staff referred to by theC*^-* Prime Minister was only hart of a larger 3chome which com-^^^^^v^u^rised, in addition, an Inter-Allied Council consisting of^ the Prime Minister of each country and one other represent-Iative,who might either be an additional permanent Member, or/might be changed according to the subject to be discussed.The idea was that the Inter-Alliod General Staff should sitcontinuously and study the Y/ar as a whole, and that theInter-Allied Council should meet from time to time to take decisions in regard to which they should be advised by theInter-Alliod General Staff.    It was agreed that it wouldnot be desirable for the Military Officers on the/AllledStaffs to be actually Members of the Inter-Allied Council.Their collective relation to the Inter-Allied Council wouldbe precisely similar to that of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to the war Cabinet.    Although the Inter-Allied
General Staff would consider the plans formulated by the General Staffs of the various Allies they would be free to formulate plans on their own initiative.    In doing this it would be necessary for them to take naval, diplomatic, financial, and economic considerations into account, and it might be necessary to attach experts to them for this purpose. Neither the Inter-Allied Staff nor the Inter-Allied Council, however, would be charged with the coordination of the efforts of the Allies in these respects, which was a very technical matter already provided for in the main by other machinery.    The Inter-Allied General Staff would make a continuous study of the Allied War plans,  just as the General Staff of the War Office made a continuous study of our own military plans, but it would no more be necessary for the Inter-Allied Council to be in permanent session than it is for the War Cabinet to be continuously studying purely military problems.

 

It was pointed out that public opinion in this country would not stand many more such incidents as the recent Italian defeat, and would probably welcome, even if it did not demand, some such organisation for better coordination as now contemplated.



Among the questions on which the now Allied Staff would have to express an early opinion were suggested: The nature of the offensive for next year, and The question of whether the main effort of the Allies was to be made in 1918 or 1919.



Some doubt was expressed as to whether in practical working the scheme would not involve great friction, and as to a ?

30th October 1917.I have been discussing with my colleagues forsome time past the future strategy of the war.     Ihave come to certain provisional conclusions whichI am anxious to communicate to you without delay.I am, therefore, sending you this letter in the hopethat after you have had time to consider it, we maybe able to discuss together the matters to which itrefers.The hard fact which stares us in the face to-day is that at the end of three years * strenuous war andafter the utmost exertions on the part of the Allies,the German Government is still militarily triumphant.Despite all the battles won by the Allies this year -and these victories -are undoubtedly brilliant - and
the perfection of the equipment and training whichthe French and British Armies have reached and theirvalour in the field, the Germans have been able to end thia year, not only with a military and navalsuccess a^aiut-t&apos; Russia,&apos; but with a strategic victory of considerable magnitude over the Italians, a vic-tory which has compelled us to send strong re-inforcehuents to their assistance, and which may profoundlyalter the face of the war.Even without this final disaster the campaign of 1917 would unquestionably have been a bitter dis-appointment to the Allies.     At the outset they were confident, that,  as the result of a great convergingmovement directed against Germany, they would make a decisive impression upon the military position of theenemy alliance, if they did not overthrow Its militarorganisation altogether,     ilieyfallure to do so, lias,of coursej been mainly due to the collapse of theRussian Armies.      It is also true that, as the result
w rof the shortage of food and other essential supplies the longing for peace among the peoples of the CentralEmpires-, has reached an intensity wM-nh threatens the disintegration of the whole combination.-    $one theloss I am convineed from my -experience of - the last three years that the fact that the result of the thirdyear5s wax is a definite military success for Germanyand a definite military reverse for the Allies is ingreat- measure also due to defects in their mutualarrangements for conducting the war*As compared with the enemy the fundamental weak-nesa of the Allies is that the direction of their military operations lacks read, unity.    At a very early stage of the war Germany established a practicallydespotic dominion over all her allies.      She not onlyreorganised their armies and assumed direction of the.military strategy-, but she took control also over their economic resources so that the Central Umpires and turkey are to-day j to all intents- and purposes, a mili-
tary Empire^ wi^th one command and one front.     TheAllies,on the other hand, have never followed suit.The; direction of the war on their side has remained in the hands of femurseeparate Governments and fourseparate General Staffs each of which, is possessed of complete knowledge- only of its front and its own.national resources, and which draws up a plan of campaign which is designed to produce results mainly on its own section of front.     Attempts have beenmade to remedy the defects of   this system by meansof inter-allied Conferences, which have lately been of increased frequency.     But up to the present these conferences have never been fully representativej andat best have done little more than attempt to synchro-nise what are in reality four separate plans of Caffl^paign;     There has never been an Allied body which hadthe knowledge of til.Q resources of all the Allies, whichcould prepare a single co-ordinated plan for utilisingthose resources in the raost decisive manner taking into    4
account the politico,!, economic, and diplomatic,aswell as the military weaknesses of the Central Powers.The crushing of Serbia and the opening of theroad to the East in 1915, the total defeat of Rumaniain 1916, and now the break through in Italy In 1917,may he largely, although not entirely, traced to the attempt to conduct the war in a series of water-tightcompartments.      It is very remarkable that each winterthe Central Powers have been able to make a crushingattack on the haeakest member of the 32nt,fi&apos;nfee with con-p&amp;ete success while no adequate counter-preparationhas been made by the Allies to meet the danger, andthat during these same winters no corresponding^,effortshave Saeen made by the Allies to weaken Germany by con-concentrating against her weaker allies and so destroying the props upon which her power depends.     These results which mean that the enemy has steadily deprived us ofthe preponderance   of men and, resources we would other*irvvehave possessed^ while compelling us to squander our
1:4resources all over the globe,without achieving decisiveresults anywhere, cspuld ^never have happened, had tJiere&quot;been any such unity of direction on the Allied side aaexists in the case of the Germanic Alliance,     If weare to win the war, it will only be because the allied nations are willing to subordinate everything else tothe supreme purpose of bringing to bear upon the- Centraltopi res In the most effective Manner possible, theriaximum. pressure military., economic,  and political whichthe Allied can command.There is, I am sure, only one way in which this can be done, and that is by creating a joint council -a kind of inter-allied General Staff - to work out the plans and watch continuously,^&apos;:&apos;the course of events, forthe Allies as a whole..      This council would not, ofcourse, supersede the several Governments. &apos;   It wouldsimply bo advisory to them, the final decisions, andthe orders necessary to give effect to them, being given by the Governments concerned.&apos;     But it would bea council possessed of full knowledge of the resources
of all the Allies, not only in men and munitions, outin shipping,  railway material,  and so forth, whichwould act as a kind of Gessnral Staff to the Allianceto adMse as to the best methods of winning the warlooking at the fronts and the resources available asa whole.      Its composition might be settled later.But provialanally I would suggest that it should con-sist of one, or perhaps two, political representativesof first rate authority from each of the Allies^ witha military staff of its own and possibly naval andeconomic staffs as well.     The military representatives would remain in continuous session at whatever placewas chosen as the scene of the Council * a labours and could therefore not be the same people as the chiefsof the several national General Staffs, though theywould have to be in the closest touch with them.     Itwould also be the sane with the naval and economicstaffs if it were found necessary to attach them also.
This &quot;brings me to the second point.      I do notthink it is possible to decide about the taking over of more line by the British without regard to theplan of cmjxs&amp;gn for next year.     The question of whois to hold the line during the winter is inseparable from that of the character and extent of the offensivenext year and the respective parts to be played by thevarious Allies in that offensive, because the amieswhich are to oake the offensive jaust spend the winterin hard training.      This is exactly the sort of questionwliioh would be referred to the Allied Council.     i therefore, consider&apos; that it is of the utmost urgencythat a decision should be cone about the Council withoutdelay, and if the proposal is approved that it should4be constituted as soon as possible.1 would, therefore, be greatly obliged, if you would let no know at your early convenience wfee*I!er theFrench Government would support this idea and co-operate with us in giving effect to it.
