HendersonTs presence, that the War Cabinet were not committed to the Stockholm project, and to the addition-al fact that the Prime Minister had left Mr. G.M.Youngat Paris with a personal message to Mr. Henderson asking him not to take any action which would commit the Govern-ment to the Stockholm Conference, it was felt that an explanation was required from Mr. Henderson as to why he had fas reported in the daily Press), acquiesced in,if not advocated, that the Western Allies should be re-presented.    It was also felt that Mr. Henderson shouldbe asked to explain why, without first ascertaining theviews of his colleagues, he had, on July 25, acqtxiescedin the decision of the British Labour party&apos;s Executivethat the Party should be represented at the stockholm conference.It was generally agreed that the position of the Gov-ernment in regard to the Stockholm Conference was grave-ly compromised by the fact that a Member of the Warlo/
Cabinet had been a party to these recommendations, even though he had taken action in his capacity as Secretary of the La-hour party&apos;s Executive.Attention was drawn to the serious results that had, al-ready followed from this action.    It was understood that theLabour party&apos;s Executive themselves had believed that Mr.henderson&apos;s support of these proposals implied consent onthe part of .the Government.    The United Textile Factory Work-ers1 Association, who had hitherto always been in favour ofthe active prosecution of the War, had also supported, al-though, it is true, only by -a majority of 75 to 70, a resoldution in favour of the Stockholm Conference, and-it was sug-gested that this was probably due to a belief based on Mr.henderson&apos;s action that the Government were in favour of Brit-ish representation.    There was, indeed, a real danger thatthe balance of opinion among Trade Unionists might inclinein a direction contrary to the views of the Government.It was felt that in other respects Mr. Hendersons action had placed the Government in a serious dilemma.    It was clear from what had occurred on the two previous days in parliament that opinion was very strongly opposed to British representa-tion at Stockholm.    If, however, Mr. Henderson had committedhimself to the project of representation, it was difficult tosee how he could maintain his attitude on that question while still remaining a Member of the Government.    Apart from their desire not to lose the cooperation of their colleague, theWar Cabinet realised that Mr. henderson&apos;s resignation on thisquestion would be equivalent to a repudiation of the plan ofa Stockholm Conference in the most dramatic manner, and thatthe effect of this in Russia might have the most serious re-action on the whole prospects of the Allies in the War.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toconsider this aspect of the question.S.
Attention was drawn to the fact that in May 1917.;-&quot;It was generally agreed that if a Conference shouldtake place, British representatives should attend.Other?/ise, the Russian and German Socialists wouldfraternise without any counteracting influence, prob-ably with the worst results to the cause of the Allies,and a wholly false impression as to war-weariness amongthe Allies might he given to the enemy by the FrenchMinority Socialists, and by written communicationssmuggled out of this country.    It was realised alsothat a British refusal to participate would have a veryserious effect in Russia and would strengthen the Ger-man anti-British propaganda in that country.tr   (War.    Cabinet 141, &quot;Minute 15). J &quot;It was suggested that Mr. Henderson might have been underthe impression that this view still prevailed.    On the otherhand, it was pointed out that in May 1917 the War Cabinet hadno more favoured the holding of a Stockholm Conference thanthey do now, and it was only in the event of such a Confer-ence being inevitable that the attendance of British repres-representatives had been contemplated.    Moreover, circumstances had so.far altered that Mr. Henderson should, at least, have consulted his colleagues before committing himself.It -was generally agreed that:-Mr. Henderson could satisfy Parliament if he was in aposition to make a statement reminding the House ofCommons&apos; that he had previously, though a Member of theGovernment, attended several Meetings with French So-*cialists; that at a Socialist Conference at Paris at christmas he had strenuously urged the active prosecu-tion of the War even to the point of being shouted downby the Minority Socialists, but that eventually&apos; hiscause had obtained a majority; and that he had gone tothe present Conference with equally strong intentionsto support the cause of the Allies.The question was then adjourned in order that the PrimeMinister might discuss these considerations personally withMr. Henderson.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 1, 1917.
