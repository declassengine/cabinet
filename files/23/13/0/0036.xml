(This Document is the Property of His BritannicHa jest y * s Government .1C R E T -WAR CABINET 330 A.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held In the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s Room, House of Commons, S ,w . j  on THURSDAY,JANUARY 24,  1918,  at 6p.m.The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byse the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper G.T.-ven-3421) and Correspondence (Paper G.T .-342,2), on the subjectof Japanese Intervention in Siberia.Mr Balfour stated that,  in addition to the dif-fioulties of securing Japanese military co-operation out-lined in his Memorandum, there was the further difficulty that Japan might content herself with a limited occupationof the Eastern portions of Siberia and might prove un-willing to effect our main object, namely, the opening upof communications with South-Eastern Russia by securingcontrol of the whole of the Siberian Railway from Vladivos-tock to the Cossack country.    A further point was raised bya telegram received from Mr Lindley, at Petrograd, sincethe Memorandum had been written (Foreign Office telegramNo.197),  regarding the views now held by the Danish Mlnis-ter at Petrograd,    This telegram showed that the germans had begun.to doubt the value of a separate peace withRussia, owing to the appalling political and economicconditions in that country.Lord Robert Cecil stated that the most recent information tended to show that the prospects of Germanygetting substantial supplies out of Russia, in the eventof a separate peace, were doubtful.    The Manager of the
Dreyfus Company had informed Sir Eyre Crowe that there were pratically no cattle left even in the Ukraine, owing to recent slaughtering on a large scale.The prime Minister suggested that the Foreign office should ascertain the views on this point of Mr Richards, whowas a representative of the  Testinghouse Company,  who had just returned from Ruasia.Lord Eardinge added that M. Cambon, the French Am-ambassador, had told him. that there was practically no cornstored in South Russia except in the town of Odessa.General Macdonogh agreed with this view,  adding that,  30 far as he could ascertain, there was very littlecorn left in the Ukraine, and the Ukrainians were endeavour-ing to get corn from the Kuban district North of the Caucasus.Lord Milner stated that he via3 informed that therichest portions of Russia consisted of the three Provincesimmediately North of the Caucasus Mountains, vis..  Stavropol,Kuban and Terek.    Between this territory and the rest ofRussia to the North,  lay the Don Cossacks, who should be  ina position to prevent supplies from this area reaching anyother part of Russia.A discussion then took place regarding the probable attitude of friendly elements in Russia towards the Japanese.General Knox stated that,  from his talks with Russianofficers, he found no evidence of deep-seated hostility tothe Japanese.    These Russian officers drew a favourable con-trast between the good behaviour of the Japanese during the russo--Japanese War and the barbarity of the Germans in this war.General Maedonogh pointed out that recent telegrams from Tiflis supported the view that Japanese intervention would not bo unpopular, and a telegram from Jassy showed thatthe Roumanians were anxious for it.
1J..      t-.&apos;Lord Milnep took the view that the only possiblechannel cf communication which held out any prospect of earlyassistance being given to the South of Russia was by means ofthe Siberian Railway.    In order to secure this Railway it waswell worth while playing upon Japanese sentiment, which mightbe  flattered at being asked to do something for the Allies-,The Japanese were a proud people, and the best policy wouldbe to trust them openly.General Macdonogh agreed with General Knox that theamount of military assistance required from the Japanese toobtain control of the Siborian Railway would not be great, asthe whole of Siberia depended upon the railway, and a disoip-lincd force holding the important stations and vulnerable points,  such as the bridge over t.]je Yenisei and the tunnelsin the neighbourhood of Lake Baikal, could dominate Siberia.The Ruosi&amp;n Army was so powerless that it was incapable of serious resistance;    and, but for their objection to evacuatetheir own country, even the Roumanian Divisions cou3d do agood deal.Lord Milner added that this view was shared by M.Maklakcff, the Cadet leader now in Paris.The question was raised as to communication betweenthe Siberian Railway and the Cossack country.General Mttodonogh pointed out that a branch line fromthe Siberian Railway left the latter at Gheliabinsk, a townin the Government of Orenburg immediately East of the UralMountains.    This branch ran South-Westward to Samara,  on theVolga, which was on the edge of the Cossack country, a dis-tance of some 400 miles from Gheliabinsk.Lord Robert Cecil wished the Cabinet to realise thatthe proposal now made would probably result in the domination of the Japanese over the whole of Siberia, and would have far-reaching results upon the world&apos;s history, as it would makethe  Japanese a prodigious Power in Asia, including the virtualdomination of China.
Mr Balfour expressed a doubt asto-whether-theJapanese could,  in the long run.,  dominate so large a country&quot;&quot;&apos;as Siberia,  inhabited by a considerable progressive Slavpopulation.    The Siberian population constituted between9,000,000 and 10,000,000 of the best  Slavs in the world.General Knox added that there appeared to be littlenational feeling in Siberia,    The Cossacks would welcomemilitary assistance, however small,.   They appeared afraid of the looal Bolsheviks.) but the  Russian Army was in such astate of cowardice and disorganisation that a small disciplinedforce could do almost anything.Lord Curzon pointed out that the danger was-that theJapanese might be content with the occupation of Vladivostockand the domination of Eastern Siberia only,  and would be un-wiliing to entertain the major proposition.    The point raisedby the Government of India, when the co-operation of japanese troops in Mesopotamia was under consideration,  should be borne in mind by the cabinet.net.    This point was,  in effect;, that japanese co-operation would enormously enhance the prestige of Asiatics as against Europeans,  and would consequently reactupon the attitude of Indians towards the British.Lord Robert Cecil stated that one  of the great  diffi-culties would be to secure the assent of the United States ofAmerica.    The American Ambassador had told Mr Balfour and himself that his Government hoped that the Japanese would not take possession of Vladivostock.Mr Balfour- stated that this view was undoubtedly heldby the Americans, but recent events in Petrograd and the be-haviour of the Bolsheviks might go far to cause the AmericanGovernment to change its view.    The introduction of theJapanese would probably involve war with the Bolshevik Gov--ernment., and this we must be prepared to face.The Prime Minister stated that  Bolshevism was a growing menace to all the civilised countries of the world.
Bolshevik doctrines were beginning to spread even in thiscountry,   they had undoubtedly spread in Austria;    and indi-cations in the Dutch newspapers showed that there was ground for believing that they were at work in Germany.M.Trotsky&apos; s view was that his pamphlets were more formidablethan Gorman guns.   Any attempt of the Germans to interfere in Russia would be like an attempt to burgle a plague-house.Regarding the attitude of our Allies, he thought the french would be only too ready to agree to Japanese interventionanywhere ,With regard to the attitude likely to be taken bythe Japanese Government, the view was expressed that, whilewilling to consider favourably any suggestion put forward bythe Allied Governments,  it was unlikely that they would acton their own initiative, beyond an attempt on Vladivostock.General macdonogh added that he had seen the JapaneseMilitary Attache, who had informed him that he thought theJapanese would be willing to consider favourably any propos-als made by us, and that the Japanese only wished to knowClearly what we wanted them to do.The War Cabinet decided that:-(a) The policy of His Majesty^ Governmentshould be to do all in their power too p e n up c ommuni e at ions w i th the S cut h-East of Russia and Vladivostock, bymeans of the Trans-Siberian Railway:(b) The Japanese should be urged to under-take military control of this railway from Gheliabinsk to Vladivoatock:(c) The Foreign Office should send telegrams to Washington and Paris, giving fully thereasons why the Government had reached this decision, and urging the american and French Governments to support theirpolicy.itehall Gardens, S.W,,January 35,  1918,
