Minutes of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W., on TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1918, at 12.30 p.m.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF and THE PERMANENT MILITARY ADVISER AT VERSAILLES.

The Secretary of State for War said that the Army Council had met at the end of the previous week and had agreed on a scheme, whereby the arrangements concluded at Versailles for the Command of the General Reserve of the Allies could be fitted in with the constitutional powers of the Army Council. (Appendix I). The Military Members of the Army Council, however, had stated their opinion that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should be the British Permanent Military Representative on the Executive Committee for the control of the reserves at Versailles. The Secretary of State for War, after considering the matter, had come to the conclusion that it was impossible that one individual should hold both posts of Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Permanent Military Representative. In consultation with the Prime Minister it had been agreed that the post of Permanent Military Adviser at Versailles should be offered to General Sir William Robertson, and that, if he accepted, General Sir Henry Wilson should be appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Lord Derby then read correspondence which had passed between Sir William Robertson and himself, in the course of which Sir William Robertson had refused the post of Permanent Military Adviser at Versailles, and Lord Derby had urged him to reconsider his refusal. (Appendix II). General Robertson had not answered Lord Derby&apos;s last letter in writing, but they had met that morning, and General




Robertson had made it perfectly clear that he would not accept the post, and could not be moved from this refusal. Lord Derby greatly regretted General Robertson&apos;s refusal, and had informed him that he must carry on his work as Chief of the Imperial General Staff until the matter had been discussed by the War Cabinet. Lord Derby was satisfied that it would not be practicable to order General Robertson to take up the appointment at Versailles. Whatever the technical position might be, no one could properly be asked to undertake a post, the responsibility of which he did not feel he ought to assume. The Secretary of State for War expressed the view that, whether General Robertson retained the post of Chief of the Imperial General Staff or whether some other person were appointed, the time had come when it would be necessary to revoke the Order in Council, whereby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff conveyed the Orders of the Government to the Armies and was the sole adviser of the Government on military matters. It had been found in practice that this order weakened the powers and responsibility of the Army Council and of the Secretary of State for War. He himself felt that it would be a great national misfortune if General Robertsonâ€™s services as an adviser to the Government were altogether dispensed with, and he himself was of opinion that General Robertson should remain on as Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

There was a general agreement with the Secretary of State for War that the Order in Council referred to should be revoked. There was some considerable discussion as to whether it was more in the public interest that General Robertson, after refusing the post at Versailles, should be asked to remain on as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, with the reduced powers proposed, or whether it would not be better to appoint him to some other sphere of activity.

The question was adjourned for further consideration.

The Army Council have considered the note from the Prime Minis-ter which the Secretary of State read to them.    (Appendix I (b)).They agree that the proposals contained in the note would he within&apos;vhe scope of the council s constitutional powers, provided that theMilitary forces of the Empire remain as at present for purposes of discipline.    The Council agree that the Military Representative at&quot;Versailles should be a Member of the Army Council, but the MilitaryMembers of the Council consider that the Officer holding- the appoint-ment of C.I.G.S. at any time should be the Military representative at Versailles.(b)  NOTE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THESECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR.1. The C.I.G.S. to hold office under the same conditions and withthe same powers as every Chief of the Staff up to the appointmentof Sir William Robertson.2. The C.I.G.S. to continue to be the supreme military adviser ofthe Government.3. The Military Representative at Versailles to be a Member of theArmy Council.4. The Military Representative at Versailles to be in constant com-munication and consultation with the C.I.G.S. , but to be absol-utely free and unfettered in the advice which he gives as a mem-ber of the Board of Military Representatives sitting at Versailles.5. When that advice is formulated it is to be submitted to the O.I.G.S.for the purpose of advising the Cabinet thereon.6. When it is necessary to summon a Supreme Council, either to decideupon a plan of operations or to settle differences that may have arisen between the various Commanders-in-Chief, or between anyOne or more of the Commanders-in-Chief and Versailles,  or for anyother purpose, the C.I.G.S. , to accompany the Ministers delegated,to attend the Council for the purpose of advising them as to thedecisions to be taken, after hearing what the Military Eepresent-atives and the Commanders-in-Chief have to say from their respect-ive points of view.7. As prompt decisions may have to be taken as to the sending of reserves to one part,,or other of the battle front, and time lost in referring to London may be fatal, full powers must be givento the Military Representative in accordance with principlesalready settled to give the necessary orders in respect of divi-sions Included in the General Reserve.8. The C.I.G.S., even when not accompanied by a Minister, to havethe right to go to France to consult in person with any one or all of the Military Representatives of the Supreme Council.9. The Military Representative at Versailles to be Sir William Rob-ertson and the C.I.G.S., to he Sir Henry Wilson.(signed) D. Lloyd George.toS S E I.APPENDIX     I.I -(a) MINUTE BY THE ARMY COUNCIL.
I    You have informed me this morning that the War Cabinet have d.e-Jaaed to appoint General Sir H. Wilson as C.I.G.S. , and to appointIan, with my present position as Army Councillor, British MilitaryI Representative to the Supreme War Council, Tioe General Wilson.With respect to the first decision you informed me that the reasonfor removing me from my appointment is because the Prime Ministercannot &quot;get on&quot; with me.    For this I can only express my deep regret,because I have always tried to serve him loyally snd to tell the truth fearlessly.    Will you please say when I am to hand over myduties to Genera.1 Wilson.With respect to the second decision you will remember that at ameeting on the 6th instant the four Military Members present ad-vised you that, in order to give effect to the intention of the Su*preme War Council with respect to the formation and control of theallied General Reserves, the Army Councillor holding the appointmentof C.I.G.S., who is fully acquainted with the resources and needs ofthe British military forces, is the proper officer to be delegated        ;as British Military Representative on the Executive Committee at Ver-sailles.    After careful consideration I am convinced that there would  I:be no difficulty in making such arrangements as would permit of theBritish C.I.G.S., carrying out the duty without interference withessential duties at home.I am still unable to see any other practical and workable system,for the reasons given in the various Papers submitted to yourself andto the Prime Minister during the last fortnight, as well as for thoseput forward by Army Councillors at the meetings recently held.    I need not further refer to them except to say that it is impossible in practice to separate action in connexion with General Reservesfrom action concerning innumerable other matters which go to make up &quot;military operations&quot;; and that the decision&apos; of the War Cabinetleaves, as before, the issue of orders affecting military operations in the hands of two different authorities       one the C.I.G.S., andthe other the British Military Representative at Versailles.    Thefact of my remaining an Army Councillor does not in my judgment re-move this defect.It seems to me absolutely necessary that the General Staff Of-officer who is to give orders regarding the Reserves in question mustbe in constant and direct touch with the various departments of thefar Office -- the Great Headquarters of the Imperial Military Forces- and be directly served by, and in close touch with, the jntelli-gence Branch of the General Staff.    Only the C.I.G.S., residing nor-mally at the War Office, can be in this position, and for an offi-oer who&apos;is not in that position to attempt to interfere with theemployment and location of Reserve troops under the British Command-er-in-Chief in Prance, Italy, and the Balkans, upon the right use ofwhich final victory depends, would inevitably lead to confusion and perhaps to disaster.    So strongly am I convinced of this that I amcompelled to say that I cannot undertake the very great responsibility-ity involved.    I say this with the deepest regret because I am keen-ly desirous of doing my utmost to assist His Majesty^ Governmentin their very difficult.task of winning the War, but on reeonsidera-tion I feel sure that you will see that it is asking too much of meto carry out and perpetuate a system which the A.G., M.G.O., D.O.I.G.S.and myself consider to be fundamentally defective.A P P E H P I X   II.fa) mUfUTE FROM C.I.G.S.  TO SECRETARY OP STATEFOR WAR..
I desire to thank you for so kindly telling me that I would notsuffer financially by vacating my present post and going to Ver-sailles.(Initialled) W.S.B.Colo St 3.,11th February, 1918.(b) MINUTE FROM SECRETARY OF STATE FOR war to C.I.S.S.VERY SECRET.It is with the greatest regret that I received your letter and Istill will not take &quot;No&quot; for an answer and hope that tomorrow morn-ing may find you ready to reconsider your refusal to accept the postnow offered to you.You must allow me however to demur to that sentence in which yousay that I informed you that the reason for removing you from yourappointment was because the Prime Minister could not get on with you.I never gave that as a reason.If that had been the reason for what you call your removal from your appointment I certainly should not have acted as an agent inconveying that decision to you as under those circumstances I should certainly have felt it my duty to resign.    The reason for making thechange is an entirely different one.    As you know at the last Ver-sailles Conference certain resolutions were unanimously accepted bythe Ministers representing the various Nations and these have nowgot to be put into effect.    They differed from the previous resolu-tions in that they gave executive power to the Military representa-tives, thus largely increasing their duties and their responsibilities -ties.    To show how this, was appreciated by the French it is only nec-essary to bring to your notice the fact that General Foch was atonce substituted for General Weygand as the French Military Repres-representative.    It became obvious that our Government must also reconsiderour position.I have always pointed out to you (and publicly) that the Govern-ment are perfectly justified in making any changes that they may think proper with regard to their Military Advisers and the Secretaryof state&apos;s duty is either to carry them out if he thinks them properdecisions or to resign if he considers that they are contrary to the safety and welfare of the troops for whom under the Constitution heis responsible.    The Government suggested to me that just as theFrench had put on their Chiefro ft&apos;heeStaff, and the Americans had put on their Senior Officer, so should we put you on as our repres-representative,  in view of the fact that decisions might have to be taken at a moment&apos;s notice, and it was very desirable that if they were,they should be taken by a man in whom the Army had such complete confidence as yourself.If I had thought this was derogatory to you I should not have as-sent ed, but I do not so consider it.    On the contrary, I think it isplacing you in a position where your knowledge can be put to even greater use than in your present position.    You have never failed to impress upon me in conversation, and on myself and others at ArmyCouncil meetings, that much power had been taken away from the ArmyCouncil and put in the hands of the Military Representative at Ver-sailles, and now when I ask you to take that place you tell me thatyou are not prepared to accept it.    You contend that it would bepossible for the C.I.G.S., to combine the two posts of C.I.G.S. at,home and Military Representative in Paris.    The Cabinet have consid-ered this and they have come to the conclusion that it would not be possible, and I agree with them.    When the Committee at Versailles
was purely advisory it might have been done, though even then I donot think it would have been advisable.    How that it is executive Ithink it is absolutely impossible.    C.I.G.S. living in London cannot possibly give a decision, delay in the giving of which might be fa-tali in France.I admit that your deputy, the D.G.I.S.S., and the M.G.O., are in agreement with you as to the proposal being fundamentally defective.You expressly omit the Q.M.G., and I do not think that you should include A.G. in your statement..    From what he said this afternoon and from what I have gathered from him in conversation, although he thinks that your proposal is the ideal one , I do not think you would find he went to the extent of saying the proposed arrangementis fundamentally defective.Again may I beg you to reconsider your decision.    You are being offered no inferior post.    On the contrary, you are being asked totake one which I think entails even more responsibility than -yourpresent one, and where your influence and the weight that you can bring to bear on this Committee will be invaluable in upholding theviews and contentions with regard to the Reserve which Sir DouglasEaig may put forward.You and I have been on such friendly terms that I should feelmiserable if I thought I was doing anything that would mean that your services would be lost to the Nation.    I look upon it as indis-pensable that they should be retained, and I ask therefore that whatever your personal feelings may be, you will as a soldier acceptthe position and by so doing I feel convinced you will be doing agreat national service.(signed) DERBY. \i11/2/18./
