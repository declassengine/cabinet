By direction of the .Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer ^ who took the Chair at the Meeting, this minute is recorded separately for a strictly limitedcirculation.
The discussion on this subject which had been adjourned at the previous Meeting (War Cabinet 224.Min.17)was resumed.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thathe was in agreement with the appreciation of the situationgiven by the Director of Military Operations on that occasion, though he himself would have represented theposition in a somewhat different form, as it was necessaryto review the history of events during the last eight ornine months.In November 1916 the War Committee of the lateCabinet decided that it was important that military action should be taken in 1917 to occupy Ostend andZeebrtigge, or at least to render those ports useless asbases for destroyers and submarines.     A plan to giveeffect to this decision was accordingly drawn up and agreed upon by Sir Douglas Haig and General Joffre.The next stage of the development of plans for1917, General Robertson pointed out, was the Allied Con-ferenoe held at Rome on the 5th January, 1917, at whichthe Prime Minister put forward proposals for the reinforce-ment of the Italian Army from the Western Front.     TheConference decided that General Cadorna should forwardhis considered opinion upon these proposals.     BeforeGeneral Cadorna&apos;s views were received a further allied conference was held at London on the 15th - 16th January,1917, at which it was agreed between the French andBritish Governments that General Nivelle&apos;s plan of oper-ation.should be carried out, and Sir Douglas Hsig wasordered by the War Cabinet to give General Hivelle every possible support and to. take over a considerable extentof the French front in order to place at General ITivelle&apos;disposal the resei-ves he required.
Shortly after this Conference General Cadorn&amp;&apos;sproposals were received and the Prime Minister then agreedthat in view of the engagements entered into with the FrenchGovernment nothing could he done upon them for the present.At a further Allied Conference held at Calais onFebruary 26th, 1917, it was decided to place the whole of theBritish Forces in France definitely under General lTivelle&apos;orders for the purpose of his operations.      The General Staff,therefore, had no hand in not adopting the Italian plan.It was ruled out by the action of the War Cabinet.At Paris on May 5th, 1917, it was agreed by theFrench and Jiritish Governments to continue   the offensive on the Western Front in accordance with the plansagreed upon,and no mention of any transference of force to Italy was made.Finally, General Robertson continued, in June and july of this year, the War Cabinet appointed a Committee to investigate the whole question of Military Policy, and after hearing his views and those of a number of other Officers,and holding a number of meetings, at many of which theChief of the Imperial General Staff was not present, decided upon the plan which is now being carried out.     The PrimeMinister, however, raised the question of the Italian plan -at these meetings and also at the recent Allied Conferencesin Paris and London.      It is now raised again, and thisindicated to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that theWar Cabinet have no real confidence in the plan    they adoptedafter very long and careful consideration. -   If this is so,then they cannot hope it will succeed, for no plan is of anygood unless carried out with confidence and resolution.The War Cabinet, therefore, had now to come toan important decision, viz. whether to adhere to their planor to change it.   . If they considered that strong stipportshould be given to General Cadorna so as to enable him to achieve a victory of far reaching results and of a decisive
8.9character, this would entail breaking off the great battlenow In progress in Flanders.     But there were many greatobjections to this, and as General Maurice had pointed outthe effect of such a decision on the moral of our Army inFrance would be very grave.General Robertson said that he did not see howany support we could give to General Cadorna could arrive intime to affect the situation or. the Isonzo Front.     fighting was now proceeding in mountainous country where there were noroads and where big guns could not be quickly brought up.In the course of a fortnight or so the issue would be known,either General Cadorna would have defeated and scattered theenemy or he would be against a fresh wall of resistance.      Itwas impossible to transfer large numbers of guns to that front in less than a month.General Robertson&apos;s own view was that it would befalse strategy to close down the offensive on the Western front in order to give General Cadorna support which would onlyreach him too late to be effective.It was pointed out that the reason why the suggest-ion of helping General Cadorna to the utmost extent was putforward, was that his present offensive seemed to hold out a possibility of attaining infinitely greater results than had been anticipated by him or by the Allies;    and the chanceof a complete victory on any main front would justify conocn-tration of all available resources on that front.     If, however,military opinion was convinced that any assistance now rendered to General Cadorna would arrive too late to be fully offective,and that in any case the event of a great victory in that theatre could not justify a cessation of the offensive in
Flanders, the suggestion would not he pressed.The War Cabinet decidedThat It was desirable that the Prime minister should he acquainted with the view a of theMilitary Authorities in regard to   his suggestion and that if the Prime minister were unable to attend the Cabinet on thefollowing day, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff should visit him end placethose views before him.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1st September, 1917.
