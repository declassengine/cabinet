It was point-ed out that,since the Battle of the Falkland Islands,there had been no clear cut and complete naval success.On the other hand, there had been a good many mishaps toconvoys and in minor operations of various kinds.: Speo-ial allusion was made to the &quot;Goeben&quot; incident and to therecent German raid on the Channel.    In many cases explanatory-ations had to be made as to why the failure had occur-red, and in the aggregate these produced an unsatisfact-ory impression.(5) With reference to War Cabinet 358, Minute S, the WarCabinet had before them telegrams No. B.L.199 and B.L.withdrawal of unnumbered, of March 4, from the British Permanent Mil-British troops from Italy,     itary Representative at Versailles, in which it was indi-communicated:-fa) That Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had been un-able to comply with the request of the executive war Board in regard to the contribution to bemade from his Army to the Inter-Allied general reserve.    In the circumstances, the executive war Board expressed itself unable to continueits work of organising the Inter-Allied general reserve:(b) That the Executive War Board has decided that, inconsequence of the decision in (a) they have nolocus standi to discuss the question of the trans-fer of the British Tilth Division from the Ital-ian to the Western front.It wa.s suggested that Field Marshal Sir Douglas HaigSo
1 should have appealed to the British Government rather thangive a direct refusal to the Executive War Board, and itwas proposed that the subject should be discussed at theMeeting of the Supreme War Council to be held next week,and that Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig ought to be pres-ent.    The Secretary of State for War strongly urged that,in view of the possible imminence of a German attach onthe Western Front,it would be unsafe to require the field marshal to leave his Command even for a day.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed outthat the present situation had arisen largely owing to the delays in settling the composition of the Inter-allied general Reserve, which ware certainly in no sense the fault of the Field Marshal, and were not unconnected withthe political crisis which had arisen after the lastVersailles Conference.    Field Marshal Haig had now com-pleted his arrangements with General Petain; he was facedwith a possibility of an immediate attack; and he did not like to risk the dislocation of his arrangements at thisparticular juncture by allocating a portion of his Re-serves to the Inter-Allied General Reserve.    General Wil-son apprehended that possibly on hearing of Field MarshalHaigrs refusal to contribute his quota of the Inter-Allied General Reserve, the French and Italian Commanders-in-Ghief might have withdrawn fram their quotas also, al-though he had no official information to this effect.The War Cabinet were strongly of opinion that thehitch which had occurred in regard to the - composition ofthe British Section of the Inter-Allied General reserves should not bring the work of the Executive War Board toa standstill,    They did not regard Sir Douglas HaigTsinability to comply with the request of the Executive war board as necessarily final, but rather as due to the im*-mediate situation on his front.    They were reminded that
2A ^it had always been foreseen that difficulties of this nat-ure might occur, and that in Article 3 of the Versaillesdecisions of February &amp;, 1918 (S.W.C.-77), it was provid-ed that in such an eventuality any Military representative should have the right of appeal to the Supreme War Coun-cil.    This appeared to the War Cabinet the proper course to be followed in the present instance.    The War cabinet also held the view that the Executive War Board were not justified in refusing to consider the question of the with-drawal of the British with Division from Italy, since siikE apart from the eventual decision of the CTCTfnaacfc supreme war Council in regard to Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s contribution,the with Division would still form part of the Inter-Allied General Reserve.The War CabinetInstructed the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff to communicate with the British military representative in this sense, ashing him to in-vite the Executive War Board to raise the ques-tion of the composition of the British portion ofthe Inter-Allied General Reserve at the next Me.et-ing of the Supreme War Council, and, in the mean-while, to give the Board1s advice on the questionof the withdrawal of the British with division from Italy.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 6, 1918*
