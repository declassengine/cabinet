 jJ3 RET.i WAR CABINET 308a.I      DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W. , onMONDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1917, at 4 p.m.jrjlGARIA.        (1) Attention was drawn to telegram No. 1304 from Berne(Switzerland), in which, it was stated that an understandingmight he arrived at with Bulgaria, which, while not involving a separate peace with Bulgaria, would enable the Allies to feel greater security with regard to the position at Sal-oniea.    It appeared that the Bulgarians were not anxious tofight unless compelled to, provided they obtained what they regarded as their just claims in regard to Macedonia andother Bulgarian districts.The War Cabinet requested:-The Secretary of State for War to obtain a reportfrom the Director of Military Intelligence, upon thepoints contained in the e/bove-mentioned telegram.BOLSHEVIK (2) The War Cabinet first considered the memorandum by theEACE HEGOTIA-tions.        . - Chief of the Imperial General Staff entitled &quot;Present Milit-ary Situation with Reference to the Peace Proposals by theCentral Powers&quot; (G.I.3145).    After some discussion:-The Secretary was directed to forward the following questions for report by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff and the Permanent Military Advisers tothe Supreme War Council at Versailles, . (General Staff(1) Can tne (permanent Military Advisers to the Supreme(War Councilforesee a victorious ending to the War?   If so,when and under what circumstances?Shis question was actually discussed at the morning Meeting, but owingto its secrecy has been included in these Minutes.She War Cabinet suggest that the following three conditions of victoryshould be assumed:-(a) That the Allies are able to hold fast in France in 1918:(b) That the Allies are able to hold fast in Italy in 1918:(c) That they have sufficient force to inflict a decisive militarydefeat on the enemy in 1918 or 1919.
(3) She War Cabinet were in general agreement that some state-ment of war aims should be made in reply to the statement made to the Bolsheviks&apos;by the enemy.    It was also generally agreed that this statement should be a declaration couched in moderate and reasonable terms in order to. show to the democracies, not only in allied, but also in enemy countries,that we were not continuing the War for imperialistic or un-reasonable war aims.    It was recognised that,as a policy ofperfection, great effect would be produced if a statement ofwar aims,subscribed to by all the allied countries, could beissued.    On the other hand, it was pointed out that exper-ience had shown that a document of this kind was extremelydifficult to draft, and was apt in the result to lose all its &apos;effectiveness and individuality and to become merely a cumula-tive statement of every country&quot;s claims.Lord Eobert Cecil pointed out there were considerable advantages in President Wilson^ method of issuing statementsentirely on the responsibility of the United States Govern-ment, although it would be more courteous for us at least toinform our Allies of the purport of our statement before itwas issued.    The present moment was particularly favourable(General Staff(2) Do the (Permanent Military Advisers to the Supreme(War Councilforesee such an improvement in the future militarysituation of the Allies as would induce the enemy toassent to peace terms more favourable to the Alliesthan those offered, or likely to be obtained, at thepresent moment?   If the answer is in the affirmative,will the improvement be on such a scale as to justi-fy the sacrifice involved in continuing the struggle?(General Staff(3) Can the (Permanent Military Advisers to the Supreme(War Councilsuggest any means by which the enemy can be prevented from securing control of the resources of South Russia?(General Staff(4) Can the (Permanent Military Advisers to the SupremefiWar Councilforesee,.either in 1918 or in 1919, a reasonable probably-ility of the infliction on the enemy of a defeat thatwould not leave the military domination of Prussiasuccessful and intact?
for a statement by the British Government, since TrotskdMslatest manifesto contained allusions to British methods ofgovernment in Egypt, India, and Ireland, which would justifyus in a separate reply, but could hardly be included in astatement of all the Allies.    He suggested that the linesof our statement should be somewhat as follows:-An analysis of Count Czerninrs proposals; a statement ofour principles; the latter would include a statement of thesanctity of international obligations; the sanctity of ourown obligations to our Allies   (thus avoiding actual mention of the difficult questions of Alsace-Lorraine and the Trent-ino);- a defence of British methods of rule, including re-ferences to Ireland, India, and Egypt, which were governedfor the benefit of the governed; a statement that the capturedGerman colonies should be dealt with according to the inter-ests and desires of the governed; and the provision of bar-riers against future wars.It was generally agreed that a statement on these lines would be too vague, and that, in the present circumstances,something much more definite was required.Mr. Barnes drew attention to,and read extracts from, a paper he had written, in which he had urged that the state-ment should be put in as concrete a form as possible, andshould be drawn up in agreement with France.    He proposed todraw attention to Lord LansdowneTs letter, and to agree infee flaeat yf our pointo; he also proposed to clear out of theway early in the statement the questions of constantinople and the Straits; in dealing with Italy and Eoumania, existingfacts should be recognised; our war aims in regard to france should be drawn up in consultation with that country; and theGerman colonies should be dealt with by a plebiscite;   andhe gathered that the result was not likely to be unsatisfaet-ory to us;   as regards Palestine and Mesopotamia, he wouldS.
say in diplomatic language that we intended to stick to them;he suggested that the Sultan1s flag should be allowed to flyover Medina and Mecca.    In regard to this last point lordOurzon pointed out that this could hardly be done consistent-ly with our obligations to King Hussein.    In regard to Armenia,Mr. Barnes suggested an American Protectorate:The War Cabinet then discussed a memorandum prepared by theSecretary under instructions from the Prime Minister (Appendix]in which the Bolshevik proposals and the enemyTs replies werecritically examined.    It was generally agreed that the formof this memorandum, though convenient as a basis for discus-si on for formulating the views of the War Cabinet, was un-suitable for a public statement.    In the course of this dis-discussion, the question of how Alsace-Lorraine should be dealtwith was considered, and after several formulas had been sug-gested, the following was agreed to as a suitable statementof our war aims in this respect:-&quot;The satisfaction of the legitimate claims of Prance inregard to Alsace-Lorraine&quot;.In regard to Italian war aims, the following phrase wasagreed to:-&quot;A similar satisfaction of the legitimate claims of the-Italians for union with those of their own race andtongue.wIt was suggested that Belgium, Eoumania, and Serbia, mightbe dealt with by some such phrase as the following:-&quot;The restoration of Belgium, Roumania, and Serbia, totheir full status as independent nations.&quot;The War Cabinet decided thatt-Alternative draft statements of our war aims should beprepared byt-The Prime Ministerslord Robert Cecil:General Smuts;and perhaps by some individual outside the government who was well versed in public opinion, and that thesedraft statements should be circulated to the WarCabinet.
jEOPOSED SOC- (4) Mr, Barnes suggested that the time had come when wefcOIST CONFER-SfCE. might perhaps with advantage assent to a Socialist Con-4161ference asked for by the Labour Party.    His own view was that such a Conference should not be held at Stock-holm, but at The Hague, or elsewhere.    Recent discussions had indicated that there was not a very wide difference of opinion between/the various sections of the Labourand Socialist Parties in this country in regard to war aims, and it might be possible to make a confidant ofone or other section and use them to disseminate propa-ganda in Germany.It was pointed out that previous experience had shown the importance of ascertaining the views of the Alliesbefore reaching a decision on this question.I Whitehall Gardens, S.W. ,January 1, 1918,
BOLSHEVIKS (5) The War Cabinet decided/that:-MAHIFESTO. the manifesto to the Governments and peoples of enemy and allied countries, dated December 29,1917, published by the Bolsheviks, should not bepublished, since it consists mainly of propaganda in their own interests, and probably In the in-terests of the enemy.
On December 25, 1917, the Central Powers published an account of their preliminary negotiations for peace with the Russian Bolshevik Party. Up to the present time the Bolsheviks have received no constitutional sanction for their assumption of authority. They consequently have not been recognised by any Government other than those of the Central Powers. They have no claim to speak for the Russian nation, but even their pretension to enter into peace negotiations with the enemy without securing the agreement of their Allies is in the spirit, if not in the letter, a violation of a solemn treaty. Nevertheless,

these negotiations have elicited from the enemy Powers an important declaration of policy which cannot be allowed to pass without comment by the nations leagued against them.

Certain portions of the enemy declaration are in accord with the views of the Allies. For example, the nations leagued against the Central Powers are in full agreement with their enemies that the war should not be prolonged a day in order to make conquests. Neither do they reject the formula of peace without forcible acquisitions of territory and without war indemnities; but all depends on the interpretation to be placed on such phrases. Before examining, in detail, the six proposals made by the Bolsheviks and the enemy&apos;s observations thereon, two general criticisms must be made:-



(1) The ambiguity of the original Russian proposals is increased by the enemy&apos;s reply, with the result that many passages are obscure. Many points would have to be cleared up before the proposals of the Central Powers could be adopted as a basis for negotiation for a general peace:

(2) Several points are omitted altogether from the published account of the negotiations which are regarded by the Allies as vital. These include:-

BOLSHEVIK PROPOSAL NO. (5).



"None of the belligerent countries shall be obliged be pay another country any so-called war costs. Contributions already levied are to be paid back. Regarding the indemnification of losses suffered by private persons in consequence of the war, these shall be met out of a special fund to which the belligerents shall proportionally contribute."





THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE CENTRAL POWERS.

"The Allied Powers have frequently emphasized the possibility that not only could both sides renounce indemnification for war costs, but also indemnification for war damage. Accordingly, every belligerent Power would only have to indemnify for the expenditure for its nationals who have become prisoners of war, as well as for damage done in their own territory by illegal acts of force committed against civilian nationals belonging to the enemy. The Russian Government&apos;s proposal for the creation of a special fund for this purpose could only be taken into consideration if other belligerent Powers were within a suitable period to join in the peace negotiations."





REMARKS



The Allies are prepared to accept the proposal that none of the belligerent countries shall be obliged to pay another country any so-called war costs. They must, however, repudiate the proposal of the Central Powers that indemnification for war damage should be renounced. They regard as an indispensable part of the basis of a just and durable peace that reparation shall be made for the damage inflicted on the inhabitants of:-



Belgium:

France:

Italy:

Greece:

Serbia:

Roumania:

Montenegro:

Russia, and

Poland.



They insist equally on reparation for the illegal destruction of merchant ships and to the relatives of those who have lost their lives through illegal attacks, as well as to those who have been injured.

The proposals for indemnity for the expenditure on account of prisoners of war and for the creation of a special fund for the indemnification of losses suffered by private persons in consequence of the war, are details which can be left for later consideration.


BOLSHEVIK PROPOSAL NO. (6).

"Colonial questions shall be decided in conformity with the principles laid down in points (1) to (4)".





THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE CENTRAL POWERS.

"Regarding this point, Germany is the only one of the four allied Powers that disposes of overseas colonies. On this subject the German delegation, in full accord with the Russian proposals, makes the following declaration:-

"The return of colonial territory, forcibly occupied and captured during the war, is an essential component part of the German demands which under no circumstances can be departed from. The Russian demand for the speedy evacuation of such regions as are occupied by the enemy likewise corresponds with German views. In view of the nature of the German colonial territory, the form proposed by the delegation on the basis of the principle previously discussed seems at present impracticable. The fact that the natives of the German colonies, despite the greatest difficulties and the slight prospects of success in the struggle against an enemy many times superior, and disposing of unlimited overseas reinforcements, have through thick and thin loyally adhered to their German friends, is proof of their attachment and their resolve under all circumstances to remain with Germany, a proof which in seriousness and in weight far exceeds every possible demonstration of wishes by voting."





REMARKS

In regard to the German colonies, the Allies have repeatedly stated that this is a matter which must be settled by an International Peace Congress, but that the wishes and the desires and interests of the people of these countries themselves must be the dominant factor in the settling of their future government. The experiences of the Allies has show that the native races live in terror of passing again under German rule. The German claim that the adherents of some of the native forces to the German cause is proof of their attachment and resolve under all circumstances to remain with Germany, is not in accordance with the experience of the Allies. The policy of the Germans was to select certain warlike tribes for the recruitment of their armed forces, and to place these in a position of supremacy over their more peaceful neighbours. By these means the Germans established in their colonies a form of Prussian militarism and tyranny over the less warlike races. It is only these privilaged natives who form but a small proportion of the whole, who have adhered to the German cause, in the hope of maintaining their position of ascendancy. The Allies are content to leave the decision as to whose rule they would prefer to live under to the natives themselves, provided that any means can be devised by tribal consultation or otherwise to secure an effective and impartial expression of opinion.

It may be added that the indispensable condition of security absolutely precludes to all nations who are dependent on sea-borne communications the suggestion that the German colonies shall be handed back to their original owners for development by them as bases of submarine, aerial and radio-telegraphic activity, to be directed against the commerce of the world at a selected moment.

i. i &apos;JIt is noticed that, supplementing the six ArticlesX. X ^containing their main propositions, the^Russian delegationproposed to the contracting parties/        x /&quot;to brand every kind of covert cqmbatingof the freedomax weak nationality strongas not permissible, as, for ^example, by economic boycott, economic^predominanceof one. country over another on the ground of forced commercial -treaties, by specialtarifjf treaties which restrict freedom oftrade with a third&apos;&apos;country, or by a seablockade which does not pursue a direct/war aim, etc. &quot;The Allies take note that both the enemy and theregularBolsheviks favour the restoration of leng economic inter-course between the belligerents after the war.      The Alliesthemselves are averse on principle to the continuance ofan economic war after the conclusion of a general peace.They feel bound, however, to place on record that theconditions of the war have brought about economic conditionswhich must for a time have a profound influence on theeconomic life of all the nations.      It has been establishedby careful inquiry that the available quantities of manyraw materials are not sufficient to supply simultaneouslythe needs of all countries for some time after the close ofthe war.      Some system of rationing will,  therefore, be unavoidable.      The Raw materials in question are,  to a largeextent, under the control of nations which are now at warwith the Central Powers.      It must be understood that theextent to which the Central Powers can be accorded suppliesbears some relation to how far the:/&quot; are prepared to assent to conditions of a just and durable peace, as set forth above.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 29,  1917.
