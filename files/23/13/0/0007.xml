Secretary.Lord, Curzon stated that the War Cabinet had learnedfor the first time that morning that Mr. Arthur Hendersonproposed to proceed to Paris on the following day in company with Mr. Ramsay macdonald and Mr. Wardle to discuss a project for the holding of an Allied Socialist Conference in london with representatives of the French and Russian socialist parties, which was to be a preliminary to an international conference at Stockholm.    He therefore invited Mr. Henderson&apos;s    \view on two points, viz,, how far the proposed visit ofMr. Henderson to Paris&apos; commitled His Majesty&apos;s Government toassent to British Labour representatives meeting enemy labour representatives at Stockholm,and secondly what would be the effect upon the Government&apos;s position if became known that Mr. Henderson,a Member of the War Cabinet had visited Paris in company withMr. Ramsay Macdonald to take part in these discussions.    Bothpoints must be examined in light of the fact that Mr. Hendersonwas not merely the Secretary of the Labour Party, hut also aMember of the Government, and it appeared to him that if a Member-
-of the War Cabinet want either to Paris or to Stockholm, thel&amp;overnment were yu&amp;GkA to he regarded as being committed to a-bourse of action which they had not yet^considered auff iolontly.Mr, Henderson agreed that Lord Curzon had stated theposition correctly.   The position had been reached by thefollowing steps.     The French Socialists had been anxious togo to Petrograd but had failed to get passports, and so hadIjiiia&amp;fced the Bussian -Socialists to Paris.   Pour Bussian delegates-were now in England en-route for Par is, and the French Socialistspad invited the British labour Party to send three delegates,,&apos;to accompany the Russians with a view to dlscussfcsg the projectedCAilied Socialist Conference to be followed,if agreement was&apos;: obtained, by an international Conference at Stockholm. Renewed1 invitations to the latter had just been sent out -to the Socialistsgof all belligerent and neutral countries by Mr. Branting theChairman of the Butoh-Scandinavian Committee.in Russia, where he found M* Kerensky and the ProvisionalGovernment keenly in favour of the Stockholm conference idea,it was very important that British representatives should accompany the Russians to- Paris; and he considered it essentialthat he himself should go in order to ensure that the conditions governing attendance at the Stockholm Conference were satisfactoryhad been held the previous day at which the following matters had been decided.     First, an-Allied Socialist Conference was *.to be held in London on August 8th and 9th, fallowed, by a bigConference of the British Labour  arty on the following day. -Secondly,,the executive had recommended that the British LabourParty should participate in the subsequent international conference at Stockholm if the Allied socialist conference agreed.   Thirdly, that the executive&apos;s representatives shou^cargo to Paris forthwith to make the necessary arrangements as to&apos;dnvitedIn Mr* Genders on&apos;s view, asuit of his experieiieacesk Meeting of the executive of the British Labour Partythe conditions and objects of all the coming conferences,
that the British representatives should he the Chairman,Treasurer and Secretary of- the Labour Party via., Mr. Wardie,Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and himself respectively,He added that the French Government were making arrangements at Boulogne and on the railways for the reception of the British and Russian representativesjourneying to Paris.He did not think the Government were in any way committed to the Stockholm project, and this question wouldnot,arise until the question of granting passports came up.Similarly the Labour Party would not be committed untilthe Conference of August 10th*Attention was drawn to the telegram received fromthe Prime Minister So.  &apos;Vin which he agreed to theproposed flalt -te ^ris, but reserved his decision regardingStockholm.     He had emphasised in his telegram the importanceof Mr. Henderson taking a prominent part in the AlliedLabour Conference*Lord Robert Cecil stated that it was clearly very undesirable that the Russian delegates should go&apos; alone andin view of what had happened in the past it was also clearthat if any British Socialists were to go, Mr. Macdonald mustbe one of them.   he added that the Italian Government had.re-affirmed their objections to the international conferenceat Stockholm, but no decisions had yet been received fromany other Allied Government including the U* S. A........-..
fejeafci3ag for himself, he felt that it would be difficult for aiatember of the British Government to meet enemy Socialists at StockholmI^il^ta4ed----that  Hitherto the French Government had been very much[opposed to the Stockholm project on public grounds.   He felt that ifla British Minister were to go to Stockholm the French Government[alight be forced to give way against its will,ijgIB EDWARD was of opinion that the Government were going to beHlaced in a position of very grave embarrassment as soon as it was known that Mr. Macdonald had accompanied a member of the War Cabinet&apos; to Paris with a view to discussing questions regarding an Internation-al socialist Peace Conference at Stockholm.   He could not help feeling that the independence of the War Cabinet was being compromised in the/patter.BjOgB GffBZOH shared Sir Edward Carson4 s view and submitted that Ita appeared that the Socialists were apparently going to take matters concerning. Peace out of the hands of Governments, and moreover it wasConceivable that a Peace might be recommended . and agreed upon by the---Socialists at Stockholm which in honour the Allied Governments couldBlot accept.pHS CHAMGELLOB OP SHE 32XOHSQUE5 pointed out that it was quite impos-Bible for the War Cabinet to take any action regarding the visit to paris.    In the absence of the Prime Minister they were quite unableto consider any questions of resignation or to come to any decision- regarding the Stockholm project.ilSR. HBBPBasOK stated that as soon as he returned from Pari&amp; nest weekle would like to lay the whole matter before a full meeting %f the far Cabinet.   He was convinced that the. International Conference at^Stockholm would take place and that if it did take place he fel^.lit to be his duty to his country to go himself.   Besides this    \-&apos;.x ----Igoverning consideration he was Secretary of the Labour Party; and hadbeen
