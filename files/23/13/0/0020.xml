SjjQ B E T.MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W. , onWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1917, at 12.30 p.m.KbBBSRAL MIL-       The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he hadjSTY POLICY.seen M. Painleve the previous evening and again in the morn-it^^^t^/WAing and that the position was as follows:    M. Painleve wasI mainly concerned   that the British Expeditionary ForceI    a should take over some of the line from the French: other-wise the prospects in France would be extremely difficult.M. Painleve represented that the life of the French nationdepended on the release from the Colours of some of the older men for the purposes of the harvest, otherwise france would starve.    M. Painleve&apos; had also discussed the Syrianexpedition and had stated that the French Government wereprepared to do their share.    He had handed in a long docu-ment prepared by General Foch,    The effect of their propo-sals was that the French were prepared to send 40,000 mento land at some point on the Syrian coast, for example,Alexandretta, Tripoli; Beyrout, or Haifa, at a later stagewhen the Turkish reserves had been so far drawn in to oppose the British either in Mesopotamia or Palestine as to givea good chance of success.    The French troops would be part-ly European and partly native.    The French could supply 10transports, but required a total of 45 transports of anaverage of 2,700 gross tons apiece.    They had worked outthe transport in detail according to the number of guns,ammunition, land transport, &amp;c, that they proposed to utilise-ise.    The troops would be concentrated at Marseilles andSalonica, with an advance guard at Cyprus.   As the WarCabinet were aware we had already made provision for 30transports, and as the French move would not take placetill after the transport of the 2 divisions contemplated
by the War Cabinet, these ships could be utilised for&quot; theFrench expedition.    Consequently, we should only have to furn-ish 15 additional ships.    The bulk of the naval escorts wouldhave to be provided by the British.    The French were satisfied with our plans of operations, and did not ask for any changein them.In the course of the subsequent discussion it was pointedout that the French demand that we should take over an addi-tional portion of the Western front was due,not only to thereasons given by M. PainlevS, but also to the decision of theFrench Government that their men zs should receive 10 days1leave in every quarter.    It was impossible for sea transportreasons to give our men, and particularly the Colonial troops,the same facilities for periodical visits to their homes asthe French Government &quot;contemplated for French soldiers.    Itwould, therefore, be very unfair to ask our troops to takeover an additional portion of the line to enable French troops to have advantages which they themselves could not obtain,particularly when it was borne in mind that the French were fighting in their own country and our men in a foreign land.It was further pointed out that if the French proposalfor cooperation in the Palestine expedition were accepted, itwould involve the withdrawal of some additional French forces from the Western front, and would strengthen the French argu-ment for our taking over a further portion of their line. field marshal Sir Douglas Haig, however, had urged that he could not take over more of the French line until the present offensive in Flanders came to an end, which would not be for some weeks.The Field Marshal had also represented that the taking over of more of the line was not consistent with his resuming the offensive next year.    To enable him to do this it was vitally important to give his troops leave, rest, and training, andif he was called on to furnish divisions, both to reinforce the Palestine expedition and to take over more of the French
line, he would not he in a position to take the offensive ef-feotively next year.    Hence, it was urged that both the french proposals were intimately and immediately bound up with thedecision in regard to the action to be taken in the Westerntheatre next year.This led to a discussion on the relative merits of a con-tinuance of the Western offensive and the alternative policies of remaining on the defensive in the West combined with aneconomic offensive with or without a big diversion in Turkeywith the object of eliminating that country from the War.        \The view was freely expressed that Field Marshal HaigTs  &apos;Memorandum of October 8, 0.A.D.652, did not provide a-oonvinc-ing argument that we could inflict a decisive military defeaton Germany on the Western front next year, even if Russia was still able to retain the same number of German troops on the*Eastern front as at present, and that if Russia collapsed andthe German forces on the Western front became equal, and, per-haps, greatly superior, to the Allies, both in men and guns,there was no reasonable probability of a decisive victory.This, however, it was pointed out, did not provide an argument for undertaking the proposed extended operations in Palestine,unless those operations of themselves opened up good prospects of success.    An extract was read from the Minutes of a WarCabinet Meeting held on August 10, when the present instructions-tions to General Allenby were approved, which were to the ef-feet that it was necessary to /strike the Turks as hard aspossible during the forthcoming autumn and winter, but thatin view of the Russian situation which enabled the lurks to concentrate against the British forces in Palestine and Meso-potamia, no geographical objective could at present be assign-ed.    General Allenby&apos;s object, therefore, was to defeat theTurks opposed to him and to follow up his success as the sit-nation admits.  (War Cabinet 210a). It was pointed out thatthese instructions were based upon the decisions taken by the
War Cabinet as the result of the investigations of the Cabin-&apos;-&apos;et Committee on War Policy when the whole of the circumstanc-es on all fronts had been taken into consideration.    It waspointed out that a success in Palestine would, according tothe calculations of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,lead to a demand for reinforcements for General Allenby andthat if the proposed French diversion was adopted in addition was impossible to foresee what the ultimate commitment inthat theatre might be.    This, again, it -was pointed out, would react upon our pprospactss on the Western front, which strength-thened the argument for taking a decision in regard to policy on the Western front as a preliminary to the other decisions.It was also pointed out that a success in Palestine might lead to the elimination of Turkey from the War, bringing with it the release of great forces for service on the western front, and the opening up of direct communication through theDardanelles and Bosphorus with Eussia and Roumania.The Prime Minister pointed out that the War Cabinet had avery grave decision to take.    He reminded them that at the outset of the War, when equally grave decisions had had to betaken, Mr. Asquith, who was then Prime Minister, had calleda War Council, including, besides the Members of the ArmyCouncil, the following Military expertsField Marshal, Lord Uoberts:Field Marshal Lord Kitchener:Field Marshal Lord French:General Sir Ian Hamilton:General Wilson:General Haig:General Grierson:General Sir Archibald Murray.He proposed that a similar course should be taken at the pres-ent juncture.    In reply to a suggestion that the Chief of theImperial General&apos; Staff might resent this procedure, the PrimeMinister pointed out that neither General Sir Charles Douglas, hen the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, nor Field MarshalLord French, the Commander-in-Chief Designate of the british expeditionary Force had resented the War Council held in
August 1914, and he himself would undertake to explain thematter fully to General Robertson.The War Cabinet decided that:-The following Generals should be invited to attend aMeeting of the War Cabinet:-The Chief of the Imperial General Staff:Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig:.  Field Marshal Lord French:General Sir Henry Wilson.At the first meeting the situation should be fully explained to them, and they should be shown all the papers bearing on the decisions to be taken in regardto the Western front and Palestine.    After a preliminary discussion they should then withdraw, and at a second meeting should be ashed to give their advice independ-ently.    The Prime Minister undertook to see the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff in the afternoon and toexplain to him the reasons for this decision.!hitehall Gardens, S.W.October 10, 1917.9
