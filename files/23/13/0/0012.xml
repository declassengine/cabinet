SJB 8 R B T.II WAR CABINET 2OS  (a).Jl. MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W. , oni?      Thursday, August 2, 1917, at 11.30. a.m.jltALIAN     0) The War Cabinet had before them the question of what in-liTAR AIMS.formation should be given to Baron Sonnino, who was shortly to see the Prime Minister and would probably raise the sub-ject of Italian aims in Asia Minor.During the discussion it was pointed out that the wishes of the Italian Government on the subject were mostly due to political reasons and that they realised that some portions of the draft agreements could not now be carried out.    in reality what the Italians were aiming at was equality of terms with the French, both in the Eastern Mediterranean and Arabia;that as regards Arabia we were trying to induce the french to admit that they had no rights in that quarter, and that ifwe were successful in doing this there was reason to believethat the Italians would be satisfied.    In regard to Cyprus we(Letter 87247 from Sir Edward Grey to M. Cambon of May,16,1916)had promised in May 1916/that we should not enter into nego-tiations for the cession of Cyprus to any third Power withoutthe previous consent of the French Government; and the Itel-ians were desirous of obtaining from us a similar engagement.In regard to Mesopotamia the idea of the Italians was thatif the Turkish Empire was to be divided, the British, Frenchand Italians should obtain equal shares and that if such di-vision was not possible in totg, the share of each nationshould be reduced equally.It was suggested that if the Italians were to have equalrights with us in Palestine and Mesopotamia, they must, asa matter of equity, take an equal share in our efforts and casualties; but it was accepted that, for military reasons,this was undesirable.It was urged also that since circumstances had altered so
much since the framing of the Sykes-Picot Agreement and thedraft Agreement, as to the completion, clarification and de-I c !        finition of which the Italians were so much exercised, that by far the best method would be to cancel all existing agree-l&apos;: ments and so clear the field for negotiation with Turkey.It was admitted on the other hand that the Italians hadi good cause for feeling aggrieved, because they had not beeninformed of the nature of the Sykes-Picot Agreement at thej -time when the agreement was framed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that his Department was engaged in conferenceon the subject with Baron Sonnino and had, he thought, fram-ed a formula on the subject which would be satisfactory tothe Italian Government.In order that the Prime Minister should be advised as tothe latest information upon the state of affairs, the WarCabinet agreed that:**Lord Robert Cecil should see the Prime Minister and posthim with the latest information so that he might be in aposition to deal with Baron Sonnino on this subject.ilfGLG-       (2) The War Cabinet had under discussion the point whether anLRBNCHJOITPEREBCB.invitation should be sent to the Russian General ,who was then in England, to attend the Anglo-Franco-ItalianConference which it was proposed to hold in the course of thenext few days.    It was stated that not only would this officerknow very little about the real situation, but that if he at-tended the Conference it would be difficult to refuse an in-vitation to the Serbian and Roumanian representatives, andthat M. Babukoff had really a greater claim to attend than any of these three.Mr. Balfour was of opinion in regard to this Conference,that if the British views on the difficulties of the militarysituationjand the duration of the War,snaxaxa^sAxfea^^irgs^yx^ksx^csmsx^msx^HgarK^xSHK more particularly those being
experienced by the British Empire in meeting the demands for money, tonnage, and men, were urged too. clearly, there was some danger of our Allies forming too pessimistic an impres*sion of affairs and coming to the conclusion that the status quo ante was the best that could be hoped for, and of press-ing that it would be better to reach this status now than to attain it eventually after further fighting and loss.It was agreed that before the Anglo-Franco-Italian Con-ference assembled, there should be a preliminary meeting ofthe War Cabinet at which the whole situation could be discussed, especially in reference to the Memorandum on the subject by General Smuts.The War Cabinet decided that:-The whole International situation should be reviewed at a Meeting of the Cabinet to be held on August 3rd,especially in reference to the points raised in theMemorandum by General. Smuts (G.T.1573) with a view to reaching some definite conclusions which could beplaced before the approaching Anglo*oEfcxxxagEranco-Italian Conference as the considered views of theBritish Government..L0HTCA-- (3) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff referred to hisjLthdrawal proposal made at the Anglo-French Conference in Paris on&quot; Britishjorces.     25 and 26 of July, to withdraw one division and three batter- -ies of British troops a^a Salonica.The War Cabinet decided that:- \Orders should be issued and preparations made forthe guns to be withdrawn.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 2, 1917.
