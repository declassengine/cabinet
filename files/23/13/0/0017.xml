The Chief of the Imperial General Staff saidthat he had nothing to add to what he had previously./stated on the subject of withdrawing artillery from the 7.Western Front in order to support General Cadorna&apos;s pres-ent offensive, or to his Note describing his interview
that morning with General Foch. It was evident that General Foch was anxious to exploit  the present Italian success on the Iscnzo.  He was, however, not correct in saying that the guns which General Potain had suggested might he taken from the First French Army for the support of the Italians were not wanted by General Anthoine.  General Cadorna had made practically identical communications to him and to General Foch. He hoped to capture certain heights by the end of the month, and he was anxious to bring his present operations to a successful conclusion by the 15th October. The number of heavy guns disposed of by the British Army in France was about l,200, whereas the French had over 4,000.  General Robertson admitted that it would be very awkward to refuse General Cadorna&apos;s request for assistance. He thought that the Field Marshal was better qualified than himself to decide whether any guns could be spared from the British Front. From the purely military point of view it was very undesirabLe to withdraw heavy artillery from the Flanders theatre while the present big battle was in progress. Any guns so withdrawn could not take part in the operations on the Isonzo in less than a month, and it was probable that they would then arrive too late to be of use. Diplomatic considerations, could not be ignored, but he thought that General Potain, before he made his suggestion, should have gone into the whole question with General Foch and Sir Douglas Haig. Whatever decision the War Cabinet might arrive at on the question, he strongly urged that not more than 50 guns should be taken from the British Front.



Sir Douglas Haig said that he had been present at the interview with General Foch that morning, when General Foch had not been able to adduce any facts in support of his contentions. Field Marshal Haig said that he had seen General Anthoine himself yesterday, in the first instance to confer with him about the request of the French that some 80 of the guns of the First French Army might be released temporarily in order to assist in suppressing a rather serious gas attack which the enemy were preparing in the Champagne district. He had told General Anthoine that he was prepared to assist in any way possible. In regard to the second question of support to Italy, General Anthoine had maintained that he required every gun In his command for the present operations on the West.     Sir Douglas Haig said that he had always found General Anthoine a very capable and tactful Commander who was working particularly well with the Belgians;    and he thought that the withdrawal of guns from the First French Army which had been promised to be used in helping the Belgians when they attack would have a very bad effect upon the relations between the Belgian and French troops. He then proceeded to point out the


**9 Ci Oway in which the guns of the First French Army were atpresent being utilised.     They were particularly use-ful in helping the British artillery in counter-battery work, and in supporting the Belgians.     they also protected the left of our Fifth Army (Gough) andthe Right of the Fourth British Army, under GeneralRawlinson, on the Flanders coast.     They further detainedGerman guns on that Front and were efficacious indestroying German guns.     As soon as the British troopsin that theatre had advanced sufficiently, the Frenchguns would be used to cover the front of an attack ^ythe Belgians.     It Was all important for our artillery to dominate the enemy1o guns, and any considerable withdrawalmade it the more difficult for us to obtain the necessarysuperiority.     If, however, it was decided that artillerymust be withdrawn from his command, he would prefer thatguns should be taken from the First French Army, and inthat case he would have to arrange to replace them byother guns.       He wished to point out that, in po-int of fact only 329 of the guns of the First French Army were at his disposal;   the remaining 119 had .Deen detached forthe support of the Belgians.     He agreed with general robertson that, from the purely military point of view,I it was wrong to denude the Western Front of any guns, andI he believed that General Petain concurred in this opinion.The more heavy artillery he had, the better it was for hispurpose, and there was already a rather serious shortageof od-pounders and l8-poonders. ..The Prime Minister said that he did not agree with,,what Sir Bouglas Haig had said about General Petain&apos;sI iconcurrence in the view that no guns, could be spared fromII the West.     General Petain, indeed, had suggested thatguns might be released from the French First Army.     Hehad just returned from an official lunch to which he hadbeen invited, and at which General Foch had been present.Sir Edward Carson and Lord Robert Cecil had also been present.     General Foch had stated to him in their presencethat, as a soldier, he was not in the least convinced thatit would be dangerous to remove 100 guns from the british front;    his view was that a comparatively small success onthe Isonsso Front might achieve great results and might even have a decisive effect on the War, whereas a muchmore considerable success in the West might have propor-tionately small results;    the Germans were a much morestubborn and tenacious enemy than the Austrians, andconsequently it would be far more difficult to make an      - (.impression upon them;   General Anthoine would attackwhether he had 2J?0 guns only, or 350;    in General Foch&apos;view top many guns were concentrated on the British Front,and their employment in such large numbers might almost      &apos;be regarded in the light of a luxury and not a necessity.General Foch evidently considered that we could well spare100 guns for the support of Italy on a Front where good and far-reaching resuls might be anticipated.    The Prime Minister. said that he had pressed General Foch to explain why, whent^e Germans were withdrawing guns opposite the French andconoenirating against the British, it was net possible/forGeneral Petain to release 100 guns from his own Command.General Foch replied that the French Front extended overhundreds of miles, and that the guns they possessed werebarely sufficient to give adequate protection to thatFront.     He had suggested, therefore, to General Fochthat a compromise might be arrived at, via./that General :Petain should release 50 guns! and that $0 more should betaken from the First French Army.
n mr.Lloyd George said he wished both Sir douglas haig arid General Robertson to realise the possible consequences of a refusal to let these guns go.     SheItalians had appealed to the French^agd to the Britishfor artillery support,:    The French/agreed to release100 of their own guns-,, which happened for the present to be under the Field Marshall command.     If the&apos; Brit-Ish refused to permit the withdrawal of these guns, theItalians would say that the French were willing to render them support end to send French guns on which the lives of French soldiers depended;   whereas the British refusedto let the French guns go.&apos;    If, ultimately, our ownoperations were not successful, the unfortunate impressioncreated by this attitude would be accentuated. . Mr.LloydGeorge said that he felt that it was impossible to send a blank refusal to General cadorna, as this would placeus in a false position.     Some sort of response must bemade to his appeal, and he asked the Field Marshal whether he did not think that the diplomatic situation necessi^tatcd some surrender on his part.     If Sir Douglas Haigwere prepared, in the circximstsncos, to release 50 guns,then the War Cabinet would inform the French authorities that they,&apos;, on their part, must arrange to make up theremainder..    The French had arranged rather astutely toplace us In a dilemma, and he felt that it was important,from the. diplomatic point of view, for us to do nothing which might offend our Italian Allies.     He wished to.remind those present that :&apos;t now seemed quite possiblethat Russia might drop out of the Alliance.     It wastherefore all the most important to keep our other allies in good heart..-  . He fully&apos; realised the very difficult position in which the Field Marshal was.placed, but he desired him to remember the great difficulties whichfaced tho War Cabinet in their endeavours&apos;to keep the alliance together.      From what General Foch had said tohim, and after reeding General Robertson1s description ofhis interview with the&quot;General that morning, Mr.Lloyd,George said that he felt that wo had errivod at an impasse.His own suggestion was that a solution might be found ifthe chief British and French Military authorities wore to-meet in France, if possible on the following day, in orderto reconsider the question on the spot.     He proposed,therefore, to the var Csbinet that when General Foch arrivedhe&apos; should say to him thet they wore strongly opposed to; any guns being withdrawn from the western Front, but they suggested that Field Marshal Sir Douglas Eaig, GeneralAnthoine and, if possible, the Chief of the Imperial Gener-al Staff should meet and confer v/ith Generals Petain andFoch, to see if 100 guns could not be sei-aped together and placed at General Cadorna&apos;s disposal.     TJhile admittingthe - forco of the military, arguments, he felt it was almost impossible to refuse the- request of our Ally to releasewhat was, after all, a comparatively insignificant numberof guns compared with the large numbers disposed of inthe Western theatre.
o no uLord Robert Cecil said that the point which had impressedhim: in General Poch1 a remarks had been that he did not expectVery great success on the Italian Front.    He himself did not,attach so much importance as the Prime Minister to thepolitical aspects of the case.    The differences between theFrench and Italians were unfortunately so great that our refusal on sound strategical grounds to release the gunswould not have any very marked effect.on the respective pcl-political relations of Great Britain and France with. Italy.Moreover, he did not believe that the addition of 50 guns tothe Italian Army would have a decisive influence towardsinducing Austria to make a separate peace.    In these (?ir-cumstances,, he objected althgether to a decision which might involve a change in the plans on which the War Cabinet had decided.   From the political point of view also we had to remember not only our relations with foreign countries, butthe effect on our own people.In the course of the discussion it was pointed out as .14a olyptctiinto the Prime MinisterVs proposal that Sir douglas haig&quot; should release 60 guns on condition that the French -    .   ,would make up the remainder from their part of the Front,that it would at once be urged by General Foch that if 50 gunscould be spared thoy ought to be sent to Italy irrespective of whether supplemented from the French.front or not.    To this,however, it was replied that it would.not be worth while totake the risk of releasing 5Q guns. as. these would not forma. sufficiently substantial reinforcement to.give general cadorna a reasonable probability of success.    It was urgedthat regard must be had to the general war situation.    Itwas for the Field Marshal to say whether the removal of 50guns would really hamper his operations very seriously.Moreover.,  it was neceusary to make the French authoritiesrealise that the British were bearing the brunt of the heaviest fighting; that if the Field Marshal was preparedto make what would be to him a very considerable sacrificethe French must be ready to make an equal sacrifice.The War Cabinet decided thatThe Prime Minister, on their behalf,  should makethe following proposals at the forthcoming meeting with General Foch:- &apos; &apos;  (l)   That Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, having, heard the views of the War Cabinet in regardto the importance of rendering military assist-ancS to Italy, should examine the militarysituation on hi3 front in detail with a view tothe release, if possible, of 50 guns of mediumcalibre from the French 1st Army now under his orders(2)     That the British Government would consent tothe release of these guns, provided that field marshal Sir Douglas Haig could spare them and. .provided that an equal number of French mediumguns could be released from other parts of theFrench front in order to provide a total rein-forcement sufficient to give a substantial sup-port to the Italian Army t &quot;-&apos;h,(3)     That an immediate Conference between field marshal Sir Douglas Haig with the Chief of theImperial General Staff, if possible, and Gener-als Petain, Foch and Antholne should be heldin order to give effect, as far as possible, tothe above proposals.*      *     * y2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.     .   &quot;September 5th 1917. -5-
