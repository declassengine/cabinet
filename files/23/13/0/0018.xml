Assistant Secretary..AIR RAID, ?       (1)    The War Cabinet had before them a report (AircraftRaid Circular No. 142) by the General Staff,. Home Forces, ona combined airship and aeroplane attac.;. cn this country theprevious.night.     The report stated that the aeroplanesattacked the South East Coast between Dover and Harwich,beginning at Dover at 7.10 p,m,, and that the airships, attacked the East Coast between the Wash and the Mouth of:   ......
the Tees, beginning at Skegness at 12.10 a.m.     It was estimated that between 16 and 20 aeroplanes participated inthe attack.     The type of machine employed had not yet&apos; been determined, and, so far as was at present known, the bombscarried by the raiders were of the normal 50 and 12 kilogrammetype.     Full information had not yet been received as to the movements of the nine airships,Major-General Shaw considered that the anti-aircraft defences had, speaking generally, been very successful in -warding, off the attack.     Ke was inclined to think that 4 or enemy aircraft had attempted to reach London, but that onlyone had actually succeeded.     He said that he had nothing atpresent to add to the contents of the report which, was beforethe Cabinet.       So far as his information went, not more than6 bombs had been, dropped on London, and the casualties In theMetropolitan Area amounted to :-Killed.10 men (including 6 soldiers),1 woman,1 child.Injured.22 men,12 women,1 child,In reply to a question as to whether our search-lights did not assist the enemy by indicating their where-abouts and direction, General Shavf said that it was impossibletc conceal Londonj      the Thames, the Parks and other open spaces, must inevitably give its position away if the nightwere at all clear.       The ammunition used by our 3-inchAnti-aircraft guns was high explosive and- tracer shell.
In regard to the airship attack off Hull, GeneralShaw stated that the attack was made In a very half-heartedmanner.     He did not apprehend that in the future enemyZeppelins would be disposed to press home their attackst asthe majority of their best and most expert commanders- andcrews had been either captured or destroyed by us.    he further stated that he himself had gone into the streetswhile the raid was in progress, and he had seen no signs ofpanic.    The  fbuses were all running, but the semi-desertedstreets showed that the people generally had taken cover.Major-General Ashmor-e described briefly the defensive measures it had been decided to adopt to meet hostile air raids. As soon a,s warning was given of an impending air raid, fighting machines went up on patrol near the coast,other machines fitted with wireless, rose in order to senddown the height of any hostile aircraft they could locate.An approximate knowledge of the height was important forthe Anti-aircraft guns, and for the &quot;Aprons&quot;,    Inland therewas a first barrage line of guns, in front of which therewas a silent zone where our machines did not fly.     Thegunners on the barrage were instructed to fire&apos;at sight andsound; owing to the &quot;Silent&quot; zone they could be certain thatany machine coming from the Eastward was hostile.     Inlandagain from the barrage line there was another zone where bigsearchlights operated, and guns fired only if they coulddistinguish the target clearly;.this zone was more p&amp;rtieu-lar-ly confined to the operations of our own aircraft.   Thenjust outside London was a line on which obstacles were being established, balloon^&quot;aprons&quot; of wire, and so on.   Within the&quot;apron&quot; line, in the Metropolitan District instructions were issued to our gunners, to shoot at sight and sound, as the\
intention: of the Pie Id-Marshal Cormnanding-in-Chief, home forces, was to have all our own aircraft distributed outside london, in order to give our guns within the metropolitan area complete freedom of action;     At present there were not sufficient guns to complete a barrage circle round London.The London barrage, therefore, was in the form of a horseshoe,covering the Metropolis on the North, East and South, theline extending roughly from North of Hatfield by Billericayand Gravesend to Redhill.       For the time being our machines were mainly concentrated Inside the outer barrage.. &apos;GeneralAshmore said that It was difficult under present conditions,to locate enemy aircraft by night.     They might or might notbe picked up by the searchlights, but otherwise the onlyindication of their position was the sound of their engines.Our own aircraft, owing to the noise of their own engines,were necessarily unable to hear the enemy craft.    The areaabout London was mapped into squares.    As soon as enemyaeroplanes were plotted to enter a particular square theCentral Control of the Home Forces directed vertical barragefire on a face of that square.     On the previous night mostof the enemy machines, he thought, were at an altitude of10,000 or 11,000 feet, but one machine was probably operating&apos;at a height of about 7,000 feet. The ordinary machine fullyloaded with bombs did not usually fly higher than 7,000 feet:at night.     The Gotha type could rise to 15,000 feet, carryingbombs.     Our own barrage guns could get comfortably to 18,000feet.     General Ashmore said that the three , scoutsquadrons allotted to anti-aircraft defence in tills country were now complete with the exception of four machines, this small shortage being the result of ordinary wastage.
8 6The Home Defence Brigade contained various types,including the following the Sopwith two-Seater, some of them used as one-seater-s by night, couldrise to an altitude of5,000 feet in a quarter ofan hour.The Arms tr ong-Wh i tw or th,The B.B.2.3., and B.E.12.The Sopwith Camels and Scouts.The Camels are difficult to fly at nighti and only sixpilots were at present able to do this.       The other Scoutscould not fly by night, owing to their comparative lack of stability and the difficulty they experienced in landing in darkness.     Various inventors were engaged in an endeavourto produce a &quot;sound&quot; height-finder, which would consist :ofa diaphragm with a microphone at either side, and was infact a variant of the hydrophone.       At present It was,almost impossible from the ground to ascertain the height of anyenemy aircraft at night,     &apos; Searchlights were intended toshow up enemy aircraft and to daxsle the pilots,,     The useof smoked glasses, however, did much to obviate thedazzling effect, as was shewn by the fact that we were/,constantly borru bing Zeebrugge at night in spite of the powerful searchlights used by the enemy.     The difficulty,;of stopping night air raids was indicated by the fact -thatfor over two years the Germans and ourselves hadconstantly bombed each other rs lines by night.In reply to further questions, General Ashmorestated that the possession of-the Belgian.coast would compel the enemy to push their aerodromes further back,,and would enable us to institute a system of anti-aircraft defences on the other side of the North Sea,    He regarded
O day raids as much more dangerous than raids by night, if carried into effect, as during the day enemy aircraft came in formation and were able to see their objectives.   he did not aniinipate a repetition of day raids, however, asthe barrage measures could well cope&quot; with them.    He didnot think that there was any advantage to be gained by theuse of gas shells against aircraft, as such shells would only be useful if employed in enormous   quantities and in very calm weather.       The intention 0f our barrage by daywas to break up the hostile formation and to enable ourscouts, who would be waiting on the London side of the barrage area, to attack the enemy aircraft individually asthey emerged from the barrage.      In conclusion, GeneralAshmore said that he was well satisfied with the previous night&apos;s performance, and that he was fairly confident thatin the course of time we would be able sticcessfully to meetenemy raids by night.The War Cabinet ??ere of opinion that theyhad nothing to add to the conclusions theyhad reached at their Meeting on September- 5, 1917 (War Cabinet 228, Minutes 1 to 5),(Initialled)       M.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 25th, 1917*
