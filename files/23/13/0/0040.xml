WAR CABINET 351 A.

DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W., on a THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21st, 1918, at 4 p.m.

ESTINE.

With reference to War Cabinet 349, Minute 8, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that a further telegram had been received that morning from General smuts, from which it would appear that the initial expenditure in shipping involved in his recommendations would amount to the equivalent of 64 cargoes of food together with 26 cargoes per annum, i.?. 13 ships running constantly.

Lord Jerby said that the problem reduced itself to one of tonnage, and the answer must depend upon the view taken by the Shipping Controller.

The Prime Minister said he would like to have the proposed campaign considered from a broader standpoint. If we imagined ourselves negotiating at the Peace Conference, what would be the value of our present position compared with our present position with Damascus added as a further pawn ? Was it worth the sacrifice of two or three hundred thousand tons of shipping ? We might find it possible if Damascus were in our possession to persuade the French to be content with something less than the whole of Alsace-Lorraine in return for compensation in Syria. Fortunately the party in France which was most eager to recover Alsace-Lorraine was also sager to extend French influence in Syria. We had a way of emerging from past wars with our possessions extended, and of causing almost as much hatred among our friends as among our enemies.




The Secretary stated that a telegram, dated 20thFebruary, had been received from General Smuts, in which heashed that if the Cabinet decision could not be conveyed to him before the evening of the 21st -February it shouldbe postponed until his arrival in London.     Tho secretary had replied that it was improbable that tho Cabinet wouldbe ablo to reach a decision that evening.Tho Chiof of the Imperial General Staff said thathe did not think, inasmuch as General Smuts would beback in London towards tho end of this month, that thodelay would be material.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.22nd   February, 1S18C
