DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, S.W., on Thursday, October 11, 1917, at 11.30 a.m.

GENERAL MILITARY POLICY. (1) The  Prime Minister said that he and his colleagues had agreed on the previous day to invite some of the most experienced military officers in this country to give the War Cabinet the benefit of their advice regarding the military situation. In taking this decision they were following a precedent set by his predecessor in office in August 1914. At the outset of the War the Cabinet had been faced with very grave decisions of a military character, for example, should they send the British Expeditionary Force to France;  of what number of divisions should it consist; should it be sent to France or to Belgium? Important military questions had also arisen for decision in connection with the defense of Egypt, and the campaigns against the German Colonies. On that occasion Mr. Asquith, besides General Sir Charles Douglas,  the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and Field Marshal Lord French,  the Commander-in-Chief Designate  of the British Expeditionary Force, had invited a number of distinguished soldiers,  including Field Marshal Lord Roberts, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, General Grierson, General Sir Archibald Murray, and General (now Field Marshal) Sir Douglas Haig. It was hardly necessary for him to say that the War Council of 1914 had not been summoned owing to any lack of confidence either in the Chief of the Imperial General Staff of that day, or in Field Marshal Lord French. He need not say that the decision to follow this precedent on the present occasion was not due in the slightest degree to any lack of confidence in anyone, more especially the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in whom they had the utmost confidence. The reason was that the moment 


was an anxious one when very important decisions vital to the fixture of the war had to he taken.    The fourthmilitary campaign of the war was drawing to a close with-out promising prospects of decisive results, and therewere elements of great difficulty in the situation. Hencehe and his colleagues had agreed to invite the best mil-itary brains  to consult with them and with the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff and the field marshal Commanding the British Expeditionary Force inFrance, who would, he hoped, be present at the next meet-ing.The Prime Minister stated that he was not goins to askfor any immediate reply from Lord French and Sir henry wilson.    It was first necessary that they should receiveall the information they required to enable  them to forman opinion.    On tho conclusion of tho present meeting theWar Cabinet would adjourn,  and  these officers would be furnished with all the information they required beforeexpressing their views.The Prime Minister said that the considerations which caused most anxiety to the .&apos;&apos;;ar Cabinet at the present justice were the following:-The military collapse of Russia, which introduced a new situation.    Since the beginning of the Revolution the Qbv-er::meat had always hoped for a recovery, but up to nowtheir hopes had been disappointed.    Telegrams arrived fromtime to time suggesting that a solid Government had nowbeen formed,  and that the troops would be bettor, but therewas no real improvement, and the Russian ;:.rmy had failedcompletely.    One test of this was that  the Russian forcein Persia,with which British troops wore actually in con-tact on the borders of Mesopotamia, was of such uncertainvalue that General Maude had expressed doubts as to whetherit was advisable to employ them at all.    In fact, he had
apprehended that their - influence might be entirely 4e-      &quot;Lmoralising-    This was the only experience we had fromactual contact,  but the reports from our Military Mis-sions and other despatches from Bussia entirely bore out this experience.    The recent incident in which GeneralKorniloff had been concerned had only rau.de matters worse../e had information that many Russian officers had beenmurdered, and that the military situation wee thoroughlybad.    The probability,   therefore, was that in 1218, Rus-sia would cease  to be a formidable menace to Germany.Consequently,  it would be unwise to make any favourableforecast of the situation in the East next year,//  Anotner disquieting factor was the position in France.General Sir henry .wilson  had been  the first to warn theGovernment of this when the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff had brought him over to inform the V7ar Cabinet onthe French situation.,    His forecast had unfortunatelyproved entirely accurate.    The French had,  indeed, not given us very effective support during the summer cam-paign.    They had not carried out their undertakings toField Marshal Haig in regard to the offensive.    An attack had been promised for the 1st of September,  and had been postponed until the 25th.    Then It had been postponedagain until October 10, without any warning to Field Mar-shal Haig until the evening of September 24.    How helearned that it had been postponed again.    Field Marshal -Saig&apos;s view in regard to the value  to be attached to Frenchcooperation in the future might be judged from the follow-ing extract from his memorandum of the Sth of October,which would be placed at the disposal of Field MarshalFrench and General Wilson:-11 Though the French cannot be expected to ad-mi t it officially, we know that the etate oftheir armies and of the reserve man-power be-hind the armies is such that neither  the FrenchGovernment nor the Military Authorities willventure to call on thoir troops for any fur-  .ther great and sustained offensive effort, atany rate, before it becomes evident that theenemy1s strength has been definitely and finally
broken,    Though they are staunch in defence      [ Qand will carry out useful local offensivesagainst limited objectives,   the French armieswould not respond to a call for more than that,ana the Authorities are well aware of itc&quot;This opinion had been borne out by the Prime Minister&apos;sown interviews .with M, Painleve, the French President ofthe Council,  during the last day or two.    M. Painleve was more interested in getting some of the older French troopsout of the trenches than in  tho offensive plans for nextyear.    One of the points which he -wished Field MarshalFrench and General Wilson to consider was a. request that had just been received from the French Government that theBritish Army should take over 100 kilos, of the Frenchline in order to enable  them to release men for agricul-bure and to give more leave to the French troops.The nest factor which caused anxiety was Italy.    Intheir recent offensive the Italians had put up an extra-srdinarily good fight and had achieved vary considerableresults.    They had  then intended to undertake a fresh attack -tack towards Trieste, in a vital quarter for the Austrians,and great results were hoped for.    To assist them in this they had asked for 100 heavy guns.    Field Marshal Eaig andGeneral Petain had agreed to send this reinforcement, al-though it involved a great sacrifice.    The guns had actual-ly arrived at the Italian front when suddenly they sent atelegram announcing that they had abandoned their plans for the offensive.    They had not even informed the aocret-ary of State for ,ifar (Lord Derby) who had been on a visit to General Cadorna only a day or two before.    They hadfully explained to him their plans for the offensive, but had not said a word of any project of desisting from it.The reasons given by the Italian Government were serious.They alleged that they could not obtain drafts for their troops and that the Italian Government could not undertaketo force into the army the classes -relied on to fill up their cadres.    This was a significant fact, as it showed that the Italian public was not supporting the &apos;.7ar suffi-ciently
seriously to enable the Military Authorities to replacewastage.To some extent,the Prime Minister remarked,  the samedifficulty applied in our ease,    Daring the present monthwe had hoped for recruits at the rate of 18,000 a week,and owing either to the protection afforded by the Milit-ary Service Acts,  or to  the interpretation of these Actsby the Tribunals,  only some 9,000 men a woek were coming forward.In regard to the United States of America, the PrimeMinister quoted Field Marshal Haig&apos;s view to be that notmore than 12 divisions could be counted on by April. by june these might have risen to 15, but it would not be safe to count on much mere than this for the campaign of1910.    The United States of America had been somewhatslow in beginning.    Developments in aviation had been throwntack for months,  owing to delays in settling types.    Thesame applied to guns and he had personal experience as to how difficult a matter it was to hasten the supply of art-iliery.    He did not wish to east any blame upon the UnitedStates of America.,  for he remembered that the KitchenerArmy had not become a formidable force before 1916,  andit had to be borne in mind that the United States of Amer-ica had a far smaller permanent force cn which to buildtheir military elfort,  so that no large amount of person-nel was available for training purposes.    Judging from the precedent of our own Army we ought not to count on any great assistance from the United States of America before1919.The Prime Minister did not -wish to enter into the tech-nical question of man-power, but he said that the Secretaryof State for .&quot;iar and the Director of National Service wouldbe asked to supply the necessary figures.The effects of submarine warfare was another seriousfactor in the situation.    latterly there had been an
improvement, and last month we had only lost about 120,000gross tons of shipping after allowing for increases.    the losses during September had been exceptionally low, and provided we could keep our losses down to this level theeffect oil sea transport next year, though serious, wouldnot be overwhelming,    nevertheless,  this was a factor tobe considered, particularly in connection with overseaexpeditl ens.In regard to the position of the enemy,  the Prime Min-ister referred Field Marshal French and General Wilson toa paper prepared for him by the Director of Military In-telligenoe ( ;Y.P.4S) , and to tables of figures recentlyprepared by the General Staff,  to show the relative numbersof divisions, rifle strength, ration strength, guns, &amp;c ,on the various fronts.    The enemy, like ourselves, had their difficulties a    Austria., there was no doubt,  is clam-xcuring for peace.    All the information the Government pos-sessed pointed in. that direction.    It was uncertain, how-ever, whether they were prepared to pay the price for it.(.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs interpolatedat this point that but for Germany he thought they wouldbe willing to do so.    This, however,  only applied to ex-isting conditions, and he could not tell what the effecton Austria of another winter of warfare might be.)    ThePrime Minister continued that Bulgaria was war-weary, andmight consent to go out of tho War for a price which des-erved consideration.    (Mr. Balfour agreed with this view.Bulgaria would, he said,  insist on holding the ground which she now occupies, which included the contested and un-contested zones).    The Prime Minister,  in regard to Turkey1:military resources,  referred Field Marshal French andGeneral Wilson to the paper by the Director of military intelligence.     (W.P.49).
Among the Allies,  he continued, we were the only coun-try whose fighting efficiency was-completely maintained.In fact, wo were the only country who was fighting at all.Consequent]y, we ought to make up our minds as to what course we ought to pursue, and what policy we ought torecommend, and,  indeed,   to press upon our Allies.    Wewere row at a most critical stage involving the whole is-sue of the War,  and this wes the reason why the  ,Yar Cab-inet had decided to follow the precedent set by Mr, As-quit h in August 1914.The Prime Minister then proceeded to outline his view ofthe al te rna t iv e polio i e s o p en to us : -The first of these was the concentration of the wholeof our forces on the Western front.    If this policy woreadopted all other theatres would not merely be treatedas subordinate, but the forces in them would bo reducedto the lowes? t figure consistent with safety on the de-fensive.    This was the view advanced by Field Marshal Haig,and wa.s inconsistent with-operations in the Gaza region.The second policy was to concentrate mainly cn the V/es-tern front, but to utjlj.ee the forces now In the variousoverseas theatres as actively as possible.    For example,in Palestine and Mesopotamia to damage the Turk as muchas possible in order to Induce him-by rough handling,tocome to tor&apos;ms,(General Robertson at this point demurred to a sugges-tion that this was his policy.    His view differed but little if at all from Field Marshal Haig&apos;s, and wasthat no more troops should be sent to these theatres,and that as many men as possible should bo taken awayin the spring.)The third policy,  the Prime Minister said, was to recog-niss that, until Russia recovered and the United States
was fin a position to supply enough men to ensure super-priority we should concentrate on economic warfare and carryout a succession of minor attacks.    This was the military policy attributed to General Petain and might be combined with the commercial offensive advocated by M- Clementel..This policy, Sir Edward Carson reminded the vi/ar Cabinet,had only been suggested on the assumption that the rnilit-ary advisers of the Government decided that the war couldnot be carried on with good prospects of success on theWestern front.The Prime Minister continued that the fourth policy wasone which he might describe    as &quot;knocking the props fromunder Germany.&quot;    The underlying basis of this idea was to counter the loss of Russia, which had been knocked out bythe Revolution,by depriving Germany of her Allies, with aview to an eventual great concentration against an isolat-ed Germany.    This might be achieved by a combination ofmilitary and diplomatic operations directed against Turkey.First, it would be necessary to deliver the Turks a heavymilitary blow, and then to offer terms designed to buythem out.    This might be combined with a diplomatic nego-negotiation to indiice Bulgaria to go out of the war.    In thecase of Bulgaria, no military offensive could be takensimultaneously with a military offensive against Turkey.Already S British divisions had been -withdrawn from Salon-ica for the operations already approved in Palestine,  andif this offensive developed successfully an additionalFrench division might probably be withdrawn from Salonica.Another proposal for giving effect to the fourth policy had been that a combined offensive should be carried out against Austria in order to induce that country to maketerms.    Ultimately, when large numbers of troops had been released from the secondary theatres, when perhaps Russia
had revived, and when the United States of America had beenable to send substantial for20s to franco, and not until,then Germany would be attacked.    This policy was based onthe assumption that the offensive on the Yestern frontcould have no chance of success so long as the forces were approximately equal, and that without a great superiorityno offensive had succeeded in the history of tho world.General Allenby had insisted that a superiority of 2 to was necessary to take tho offensive with good prospects of success against the Turks,  and the fourth policy hehad just described was based on a similar assumption.    Theeffect of the adoption of this policy on the strategy ofthe Western front would be that, so long as the forces inthe West were approximately equal,  the policy attributed to General Petain would be adopted; that is to say,  to strike first at one place and then at another withoutmaintaining any one continuous offensive.    The&apos; French claim was that this policy contained as many German troops op-posito their lines as before.Lord French said it was essential that he and General sir henry Wilson should bo given access to the fullest possi-ble information.    At the present time he was net at allwell informed on this matter.    He asked that, in additionto any &quot;papers that might be furnished to him,  the Directorof Military Operations and the Director of Military In-telligence might be asked to give him and General Wilsonverbally any information that they required.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed to  this.Sir Sdward Carson said that the main questions on whichhe personally wished to have the views of Field MarshalFrench and General Wilson were as follows t-(1) Is it possible bo carry through a successful offen-sive on the Western frorit?   By this he did not nec-essarily mean to win a. great pitched battle whichwould defeat the enemy and cause him to run away. Itwould be sufficient to break down the enemy&apos;s moral
so that his forces would crumble away, and ho wouldbe unable to hold his ground and be obliged to re-treat :(2)    If the answer to (1) should be in the negative, what should our policy be?    Ought we  to hold on and a;o-ply the economic offensive,  cringing home some ofcur troops to strengthen our own economic position?(3)    In cither of the two above oases what would be theeffect of the proposed offensive against Turkey?    Ithad to be borne in mind in answering this question that both British and French troops would have tobo taken away from the Western front.    How many ofthese troops, he ached, would ever return to France?In fact, he wished to know what would be the effectof these large ,:&amp;de shows&quot;?(4)  This raised the question of what course we ought toadopt towards France.    He was being forced to theconclusion that France was  trying to oast the whole burden of the War upon us.    So far as it was a matter for experts, ha would like to know their views asto our&apos; acceding to the French request to take over100 kilos,  of the line,bearing in mind that it wouldbe difficult to obtain support in this country foran acceptance of the French proposals whon so manyof our men had boon abroad for months or years with-out returning homo on leave.General Smuts asked that the War Cabinet might be furn-ished with information as to the relative attrition of theBritish and German forces in Flanders.    Could the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff say at what rate  the origin-al 42 divisions with which we started the Flanders offen-sive were wasting?The Chief of  the Imperial General Staff undertook tofurnish this information,
I lord Cur?;on asked that information might be furnishedas to the effect of our offensive on our man-power.    Hehad no clear idea as to what our present man-power posi-tion with regard/&quot;future operations of the   &apos;;ar was.The Secretary was directed to obtain this information from the Director of National Service.Attention was drawn to the unsatisfactory information furnished to the War Cabinet in regard to wastage fromsickness.    The Prime Minister said that M.  Painleve had stated that the French were losing men at tho rate of54,000 a month from all causes.    This amounted to 650,000men a year,  and these losses were only made good to theextent of 225,000 a year.    The War Cabinet would wish toknow what the total wastage of the British Army was fromall causes.The Secretary of State for War undertook to furnishthis information.The Chief of the Imperial G-eneral Staff suggested thatField Marshal French and General Wilson should be askedto put their general conclusions on paper, and to furnishthem to the War Cabinet,  if possible, before their nextattendance at the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided that: -(1)  The Secretary of Stats for War should furnishparticulars of the total rate of wastage fromall quarters of the British Army in the varioustheatres of war:(2)  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff shouldcomrtunrcate with Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haigin order to ascertain on which day early next week it would be convenient for him to attend ameeting of the War Cabinet for the purpose of continuing the discussion commenced at  thismeeting:(3)  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should.furnish to Field Marshal French and General Wibsonthe various memoranda and telegrams on general \policy and future policy on the Western front aiid ,in Palestine.    He should also authorise the
Director of Military Operations and tide if rectorof Military Intelligence to furnish Field Marshallord French and General.  ?ilson 7/ith^al&apos;l the in-formation they required.    He should/7Supply theWar Cabinet with particulars of the rate of at-trition of British divisions in the Flanders of-fensive:(4)   The Secretary should invite the First Lord,, first sea Lord,  and the Shipping Controller  to attend the meeting at which this discussion will becontinued&apos;;(5)  The Secretary should obtain from the Director ofNational Service a statement of the outlook asregards man-power and recruiting as boarlag onthe future military campaign and circulate it toall c o no erne d:(6)  The Secretary should furnish Field Marshal lord french and Genera].
