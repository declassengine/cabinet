(This Document iff the Property of HisBrltannio^jfe^leafa&quot; GcVVrnmelit),SECRET .WAR   CABINETJ27A.MINUTES- of a Meeting held at 10 Doming Street, 3.&apos;*. onMonday, September 3rd, 1917,. at 11c30 a*m.Stpport   for italy,SAL I AIT FRONT. (l)     With reference to War Cabinet 225A, theDirector of Military Operations referred to a telegramfrom General Delme-Radcliffo to the effect that general cadorna&apos;s army, having got through the first twoAustrian lines, was now held up until the Italianguns could be     brought   up.   Further battlos might beexpected at dates which he indicated.It would be possible to send English guns for the later battle and have them there in time.The Director of Military Operations pointed out,however, the difficulty of keeping our own artilleryup to strength..     At present our 6-inch Howitzers were28 down on establishment.     Therefore, we could onlyhelp Italy at the expense of Sir D. Eaig.The opinion of our Military Authorities was thata few batteries would not make the difference between a big and a moderate success..The Director of Military Operations reported thatGeneral Foch was coming over on the following day to propose that 100 Heavy guns from the 1st French Army(practically under Sir D, Eaig on his loft flank)should be sent to Italy.     This would be tantamount to taking 100 guns from Sir D. HaigJs operations in flanders..
i OThe Director of Military Operatio.na stated that both Sir D. Eaig and Sir       Robertson had been informed of the fact and purpose of /General Foch^s visit andthey were coining to London to discuss the matter.The Director of Military- Operations said that hehad been informed that there had recently been a diminution of 70$ in the German ammunition over theFrench Sectors, indicating that the Germans wereconcentrating their ammunition on Flanders.     If,therefore, any guns could be spared from the western front for Italy it would seem that they should be sent by the French from their own Front.     If the guns were sent from Flanders it would, in his opinion, andsubject to anything Sir D. Eaig might say to-morrow,mean stopping the offensive, and be equivalent to achange of the War Cabinet1s policy which was now beingcarried out.The War Cabinet decided -That this discussion should be adjourned until the same evening when the PrimeMinister would be present.(Initialled) A.B.L.2 Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.3rd September., 1917.
