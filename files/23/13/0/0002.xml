THE PRIMS MINISTER reminded the War Cabinet that thereason why General Murray had been recalled from Prance ear-lier in the War was because experience had shown that hehad not the nervous constitution to cope with emergenciesand situations of great difficulty.    The late battle inEgypt had had precisely the result that he would have ex-pected from Sir Archibald Murray.    He had not followed theenemy up as leneral Maude had done.    The real reason whyGeneral Murray had been sent to Egypt was because general sir William Robertson was required as Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, and it was necessary to find another postfor General Murray.    He himself felt that it would be a veryserious misfortune if we missed one of the great opportun-ities of the War through not having a Commander-in-Chief withquite the necessary qualities.    No doubt the Chief of theImperial Ceneral Staff would suggest that General Murrayought not to be taken away just at the moment when he wasabout to reap the fruits of his previous efforts.    This, how-ever,  in reality, was not the case, as he did not believethat he ever would reap the fruits.    What we required at themoment in Egypt was a man of the dashing type such as Gen-eral Birdwood, or Ceneral Bridges.    In the absence of a man of this type we might lose a great opportunity.    GeneralBirdwood, he pointed out, had been in Egypt in the early part of the War and knew the local conditions.    All he askedfor now was a decision from his colleagues as to whether theyshould consult the Chief of the Imperial General Staff onthe question of the expediency of changing General Murray.LORD MILNER agreed that between General Murray andheGeneral Birdwood he would/inclined to choose the latter,though he did not know General Murray.    He laid great stress,however,  on the importance of following the views of theC.i.vJT.S.
MR HENDERSON asked how long it would take for a newCommander-in-Chief from France to reach Egypt?THE PRIME MINISTER said it would take a fortnight.    he pointed out that General Murray was by nature very timid.His opinion was that General Murray&apos;s undoubted qualitiescould best be employed in the United States of America. Hewas a very distinguished officer, with a good address, andhe had held very high commands.    Probably the best man for the command in Egypt would be General Bridges, but he understoodthat he could not be spared from Prance.LORD CURZON pointed out that we were contemplatingwithdrawing General Murray, not because he is the best manfor America, but because we did not consider him the bestman for Palestine.    He reminded the War Cabinet that if were moved General Murray we should be superseding the man whohad been uniformally successful.    If lm he had erred at allit had only been on the side of caution.    He successfully de-fended the Suez Canal against the Turkish attack.    He pushed forward iiis railway; captured El Arish; cleared the SinaiPeninsula, and advanced successfully to the verge of Pales-atine, where he fought/successful action.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested the possibility that hehad crept where he ought to have rushed.LORD MI LITER laid great stress on the difficulties of operations in Palestine.    Water was very short and the phys-ical difficulties were consequently very great.    He confess-ed that General Murray had done much better than he himself had anticipated.MR 30NAR LAW pointed out that to Send General Murray to america would not conceal the fact that he had, in reality,been superseded.THE PRIME MINISTER said that personal aspects of thequestion must, though he regretted it, be regarded as second-ary.    There was only one question really to decide, namely,
as to whether we were likely to succeed in Palestine with aman of General Murray&apos;s temperament, or whether we shouldnot do better with a leader of the type of General Maude.We could not run the risk of just losing the opportunityof a great coup.LORD MILKER said he had rather inclined to the view thatin course of time General Murray would bring the campaign to a successful issue.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had an uneasy feeling thathe would not. He feared he lacked sufficient dash and was rather timid.LORD curzon said it was really unfair to quote the anal-ogy of General Maude.    The latter had had a much longer and better period of preparation.    After the defeat of the Turksat Kut-el-Amara, General Maude had only to advance in great-ly superior force across a flat plain with a river to helphis transport.    He&quot; asked whether we really had a better manthan General Murray in view, and he pointed out that GeneralMurray now had much experience of the local conditions.    ToImperialremove him just after the/War Cabinet had sent him a telegramof congratulation would require a good deal of justification.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that Generals Home, Bridg-es, Birdwood,  Jacobs, and Watt, were all first-class men forthis class of fighting.    General Birdwood had been inEgyptand was as familiar with this type of fighting as GeneralMurray himself.    What we required was a hard fighting man,which General Murray, was not.LORD MILNER pointed out that General Murray had been heldback a good deal from home.    His original instructions didnot contemplate any advance into Palestine, but only opera-tions for the defence of Egypt.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that General Maude&apos;s in-structions were precisely similar, but as soon as he brokeup the Turks the C.I.G.S. revised his instructions and en-4. couraged
him to push on.LORD MILKER considered that of those mentioned by thePrime Minister General Birdwood was probably the most suit-able.    He had had experience of fighting in India, Egypt andSouth Africa,  in all of which physical obstacles as in Pales-tine were probably harder to overcome than the enemy.THE PRIME MINISTER repeated that what we required wasa hard fighting man not easily discouraged.    He anticipatedthat we should have a good many checks,just as General Maudehad been checked at Kut, but we required a man who could-ap-preciate the situation and whojwould not be afraid to takerisks in order to secure a great success.MR BOWAR LAW pointed out that the Turks in front of Gazawere entrenched, whicn added to the difficulty of GeneralMurray&apos;s task.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in his opinion the recentbattle near Gaza had been unsatisfactory.    He had a feeling that a more determined Commander-in-Ghief would have brokenthrough the Turks.    General Murray1s action reminded him alittle of General Buller on the Tugela River,  though, perhaps,he added, it was unfair to make such comparison.    What he feared was we might lose bringing off a very great coup.MR BONAR LAW said that he would not have selected GeneralMurray for an operation such as was now contemplated, but be-fore superseding him he wanted to be sure that he had not donewell.LORD MILNER agreed with the PRIME MINISTER that person-al considerations ought not really to affect the War Cabinet&apos;decision.    He was not satisfied, however,  that General Murraywas sufficiently bad nor that any other General was sufficient-ly better to make sure of better results.MR BONAR LA7/ said he would not have any hesitation inmaking the change if he felt sure that General Murray hadmissed his opportunity.    He was by no means sure of this.
LORD MILNER agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that,  injhis opinion,  the dif-difficulties of this campaign were only just beginning.    TheTurks were reinforcing in Egypt and would put up a stifffight.    He asked if any Member of the War Cabinet consideredthat General Murray was the man to burst through?LORD CURZON reminded the War Cabinet that on previous occasions when the Government had recalled Generals it hadbeen because they had lost the confidence of their troops as in the case of Sir Ian Hamilton.    Had we any information,he asked,  that General Murray had lost confidence in his command?THE PRIME MINISTER said that so far as his informationwent he had never had their confidence.which mr BONAR LAW said that one fact/weighed with him wasthat General Murray had been quite unable to assert his viewsagainst Lord Kitchener.LORD CURZON pointed out that our object was to capture-Jerusalem at the earliest possible moment.    It would take a fortnight for a General from Prance to reachSgypt, and val-uable time might be lost.(THE PRIME MINISTER read a telegram which had just arrived from General. Murray and which was generally agreed bythe War Cabinet to confirm the views of his characterthat had been expressed.)(The War Cabinet then turned to the discussionjof other questions while Lord Curzon went to consult Lord Frenchvery confidentially as to his private opinion in regardto General Murray, who had been his Chief of Staff inFrance.)(The question was resumed at 5.5p.m.)LORD CURZON informed the War Cabinet that he had had afull talk with Lord French on the subject.    The Field Marshalhad stated that before the War he had found General Murrayan extremely competent Commander-in-Ohiaf at Aldershot.    his experience of him in France had been far less favourable.
14He had not proved a satisfactory General in the field.    Hehad lacked self-control and moral courage, and had showngreat irritability in those difficult early days.    lord french had given him many instances of this.    Afterwardshe had consulted Lord French informally as to who would bea suitable man to Command in Egypt.    While expressing avery favourable opinion both of General Birdwood, whom he did not know.as a General, and of General 3ridges, lord french had said that if the responsibility rested with himhe would not hesitate for a moment to select General Chet-wode, who was at this moment in Command of a corps in thePalestine Expedition, and was, in his opinion, an ideal manfor anything of this kind.  Lord French had been very em-phatic on this point.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was quite satisfied thatGeneral Murray wasftiot the man who could be trusted to take agreat decision as to whether, for example, he would risk theloss of 10,000 men in order to inflict a decisive defeat onthe Turks.(The War Cabinet decided to discuss the matter onthe next day with the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff).hitehall Gardens, S.W.April 6, 1917.
