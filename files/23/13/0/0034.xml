(This &apos; Document is the Property of His Britannic /IS&amp;fi e sty &apos; s Government.)3 T -WAR 0ADII-F.T 5 09 A;ERA.PT MINUTSS of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.,on TUESDAY,   JANUARY 1 j- 1918, -at 11-30 a.ra.   -With reference to War Cabinet 308, Minute 7, the WarCabinet continued their discussion in regard to the protec-tion of the large accumulation of stores at Vladivostock,which, unless&apos;safeguarded, might very probably fall into thehands of the enemy and be used against us.    The total acou-raulation of stores at Vladivostock amounted to about 6S5,.000tons, including ISO,000 tons of railway materials, 67,000tons of nitrates, 65,000 tons of barbed wire, and other val-uable supplies.    These stores had been mostly paid for outof British credit,  perhaps one-seventh having been paid forout of American credit. -Lord Robert Cecil said that,  in his opinion, therewere only two alternatives;    either- to leave the stores alone,or to encourage the Japanese&apos;to send a really strong force.He did not think that it would be of any value merely to send a small number of British troops.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he agreed with Lord Robert Cecil.    It was undoubtedly of greatimportance to prevent the valuable war material at Viadivos-tock from falling into&apos; German hands.    Ke  referred to a deci-sion of the War Cabinet on December 7,  1917  (War Cabinet 394,Minute 10), -when it had been decided that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should send telegrams to washington and Tokio on the subject, but the United States Government
had refused to take action in the matter.    General Robertsonsaid that, in his opinion, a force should be sent, and thatit must necessarily be Japanese or American,  or both&quot;,    forchoice, it should not be solely Japanese, as in this casethe Russians as a whole, not merely the Bolshevists, wouldbe opposed to this step.    In order to show the Russians thatthe measures were purely protective and had no sinistermotives behind them, he thought it would be best to send afew Chinese and British troops to show the flag.    We couldsend two Infantry Companies from Hong-Kong.    It was impossi-ble to say exactly what force would be necessary, as we hadno reliable information as to the Russian troops in thatvicinity, but no doubt the Japanese had the information and would be able to. decide.The War Cabinet were of opinion that it was of thefirst importance that some action should be taken immediate-ly, and that the plan open to least objection was to allow the Japanese to occupy Vladivostock.    This, of course,raised a very large question of policy, involving the pos-sible exploitation of Slastern Siberia by the Japanese, and probable resentment by the Russians.    These dangers, how-ever, might be mitigated if all the Allies,  or at least the americans, British and Chinese, participated,After some discussion, the War Cabinet decided that:-(a) The Admiralty should send the &quot;SUFFOLK&quot;,now at Hong-Kong, to Vladivostock at once,and that they should, in consultation withthe Foreign Office, determine what cr-dersshould be given to the Captain of the Ship:(b) The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should inform the Japanese Ambas-ambassador that we were proposing loint action at Vladivostock, in order to protect the stores ac cumula t e d the re *.(c) The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send a telegram to colonel house,  for the inforioation of PresidentWilson, adumbrating the policy proposed above,  laying stress on the danger of the stores falling into the hands of theGermans, and asking for the co-operationof the United States Government in thematt er:
(d)(e)ThetheSecretarynecessaryof State for gararrangements forshould maketwo  Infant r&quot;Companies, now at H^ng-Ivong, to.be ready to start for ^ladlvostoak:The Minister of Munitions should furnish the Foreign Office with details as to theamount and value of the  stores at Vladivos-took, which information should be includedin the Foreign Office telegram to colonel house. &apos;, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 1,  1918.
