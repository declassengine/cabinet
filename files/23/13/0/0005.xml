i BRITISH With reference to War Cabinet 135a,  Minute 4,   theASSADORWASHINGTON. Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had forwarded to Lord Grey a copy of Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram,  and had suggested to him that he should accept the appointment ofBritish representative    in Washington.    Today he had seenLord Grey,  who had replied that he felt he was not theright man to send at the moment, hut that if after Mr.Balfour&apos;s return he found that President Wilson,  colonel house,  and Mr. Page all desired that he should go to washington,  he might he willing to reconsider the position.The Prime Minister understood that Lord Grey would probablymake a communication to him in this sense.After his conversation with Lord Grey the PrimeMinister had come to the conclusion that he was not theright man for Washington at this juncture.    His mind was too much fixed on peace and too little on the activeprosecution of the War.    His fear was that if Lord Greywere sent he and President Wilson would he talking ofpeace when they ought to be preparing for War.    The typeof man we required at the moment at Washington was some-one who could get in touch with the Heads of the greatsupply Departments and put pressure on them to assistthe Allies in the active prosecution of the War; in fact,to direct people in the United States into doing thingsinstead of talking about them.

1 ao "to  confine war energies to taking up War Loan and tofestivities and banner-waving.    The American Ambassador hashimself admitted that there was some truth in this, but he stated that it was due mainly to ignorance of what was theaction required.    In the circumstances, he felt inclined to telegraph to Mr. Balfour that Lord Grey was not willingto go,  and that,  in the opinion of the War Cabinet,  a man of a different stamp was required.    He himself believedthat Lord Northcliffe would be a good selection.    his presence in the United States would not be required for more than six months,  and his specific task would be toorganise the American nation for war.    The Prime Ministerrecalled how Lord Rhondda had been sent out by him when hewas Minister of Munitions to organise the munitions resourcesof the United States, which he had accomplished within sixmonths.During the subsequent discussion several objections were raised to Lord Northcliffe&apos;s appointment.    It waspointed out that    he was prone to quarrel with those whowere not his inferiors.    Although at the moment we requiredsomeone with great drive and energy,   the day might not be far distant when a man of high diplomatic qualities wouldbe required.    Moreover,  experience had shown that the british representative should,   if possible,  be on terms of personalconfidence with the President and the Secretary of State,and some doubts were expressed as to whether this wouldbe the case with Lord Northcliffe.The question was adjourned for further consideration.2 Whitehall Gardens,   S.-W.May 16,   1917.
