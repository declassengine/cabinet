S B C B B T .WAR CABINET 135a.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, Son Wednesday, May 9,  1917,  at 12.30 p.m.(l)    The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed theWar Cabinet that,  in accordance with their instructions on the previous day (War Cabinet 134,  Minute 6), he had discussed the question of the Palestine Expedition withGeneral Smuts,  who,  before accepting the Command,  had wished to know what the general policy of the Governmentwas in regard to the Expedition.    In view of the new situation created by the Russian Revolution,  he had not felt able to answer this question completely,  nor had hebeen able to assure General Smuts that the necessaryreinforcements and guns to ensure the defeat of theTurkish forces and the conquest of Palestine could bemade available.    In his view the whole policy of the Pal-estine Expedition required very careful examination,  andhe had,  therefore,  suggested that General HSmuts should beasked to attend the War Cabinet to discuss the situation.General Smuts said that he was much honoured by the &apos;offer of the Command of the Palestine Expedition,  and froma personal point of view he would much like to accept it.He felt,  however,   that the whole policy was now somewhatdoubtful.    At this period of the War no experiments couldbe made.    Any new expedition that was entered into mustbe carried out to a successful conclusion.    If thisexpedition were pushed to its logical conclusion,   itwould involve our penetration through Palestine,   and farinto Syria.    It would threaten the Turks more vitally
than any action we had taken since the attack on theDardanelles.    Consequently, we must expect to meet allthe strength &quot;which Turkey could concentrate and must provide for a very big campaign.      Before entering on it we ought to examine the situation elsewhere.Mesopotamia is  very far off,  and the military operationsthere In his opinion, would not necessarily very muchaffect the situation in Syria.    The Turks had alreadylost it, and might be inclined to write it off.    It did notappear that the Russians could be relied on to hold manyTurks ifl. front of them.    Consequently,  the greater part ofthe Turkish Army would be free for operations in Syria and palestine.    We could not rely on holding any Turks at salonica, and,   indeed, we might have to reduce or even toabandon this campaign.    In his opinion,  the British troops now at Salonica if transferred to Egypt might suffice for thePalestine campaign.    He himself, however, felt that itwould hardly be wise to make this transfer.    The wholemilitary situation at present was very uncertain, and theGovernment were bound to consider in what way the militaryparalysis of Russia was likely to affect the militarysituation of the Allies as a whole.     His own feeling wasin favour of utilising any forces released from Salonica,not for a new experiment, but as a general reserve forany emergency which might arise.    He had before drawn theattention of the War Cabinet to the danger that was runthrough our having no strategical reserve on the western front to meet emergencies.    The Salonica force should,in his opinion, be used as the nucleus of such a strategicalreserve.    Having    regard to all these considerations, he felt that In undertaking an expedition against Palestineit would, be difficult to avoid a defensive arriere pensee
and he could not accept the Command in such circumstances.It was true,&apos;as the Prime Minister had suggested,  thatGeneral Maude was, to some extent,  subject to the samelimitations, but the Turkish threat against Mesopotamiawas hardly as great as in the  case of the  PalestineExpedition.There was some discussion as to the number of troopsthat the Turks could bring to bear in Palestine,  and theChief of the imperial General Staff stated that South&quot;.of jerusalem the British could probably bring a larger force to bear,  since their communications would be superior,but that ilorth of Jerusalem it was probable that the Turks would have  the advantage.      The General Staff estimateof the number of troops that could be maintained by theTurks at Gaza was 60,000, but there was nothing toprevent them from concentrating larger  forces further to the Ilorth, which would enable them constantly to pushup fresh troops to relieve those that had been in action.In these conditions they could also maintain a large pro-portion of their artillery and machine guns on the Gazafront. -   -As an intermediate policy between a purely defensivepolicy and the large campaign into the heart of Syria,which General Smuts had appeared to contemplate,  it wassuggested that it might be possible to press forward asfar as Jerusalem in order to gain the moral advantagesresulting from the capture of a city with such unique,historical,  religious, and sentimental associations.In this connection it was pointed out that the Turksthemselves attach great sentimental value to Jerusalem,and would mass large forces for its defence.-      -
It was generally recognised that General Smuts was fully justified in postponing his decision until thegeneral policy of the Palestine Expedition was settled,and that this point could not be decided without a wider review of the military situation created by recent events in Russia.(2)    Arising out of the consideration of Palestine,the War Cabinet had. some preliminary discussion onthe situation which would arise in the event ofRussia making a separate peace,  although it was recog-nised that no conclusion could be reached-The Prime Minister asked that before thisquestion was discussed more fully his colleagues wouldgive their thoughts to the following aspects of thequestion.    He pointed out that if Russia went out ofthe war,   the whole situation would be transformed.One effect would be that the blockade would be,   to alarge extent,  neutralised.    Russia possessed boundlessstocks of wheat,   oils,  and minerals,  and. these wouldbe available to the Central Powers as soon as Germanorganisation could provide the necessary means oftransport.    Another effect would be that very largeGerman forces would be released for service on theSouthern and Western Fronts,  where Germany particularly if Austria remained her Ally,  would be superior bothin guns and in men,   to the Allies-&apos;.    In such circumstances,the best chance for the Allies would appear to lie ina separate peace with Austria,  in which It/H^ay might haveto be compelled to acquiesce.    If we failed to induceAustria to make a separate peace,  he could see no.hopeof the sort of victory in the V/ar that we desired.    In thecircumstances,   it might be necessary to make a bargain with
Germany for evacuating Belgium in return for the restora-tiou-of her Colonies,  and  this was a point  to which hedraw General Smuts&apos;  attention.    If it should prove&quot;impossible to persuade Austria to make a separate peace,he inclined to the view that it&apos;would be a mistaken policy to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives in attacks onthe Western Front, where even now we were doing little morethan hold our own, and he would like the war Cabinet toconsider whether,  in these circumstances,  it would not bea better policy to concentrate our efforts on a campaign to break up Turkey.      Already we occupied Mesopotamia,Russia occupied Armenia,  and we were on the borders ofPalestine.      To continue the process of releasing subject-peoples from Turkish oppression would be to gain some con-sid :rable advantage.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked thatthe further discussion of this question might be postponed until the Paper that he was preparing for Lord Curzon onthe Russian Situation,  together with Lord Carson&apos;s Report,were available. .. In the meanwhile, he wished to utter afew words on caution in regard to the Palestine Expedition.&apos;IT it was worth while for us to capture Jerusalem,, it was worth while for the Turks to turn us out.    Turkey had some400,000 men,  that is to say,&apos; enough to take the offensive against our forces both in Rales tine and Mesopotamia.    I/henhe had advised a forward military policy in Palestine and mesopotamia it had been on the assumption that Russianco-operation would he effective.    This,  however, was nolonger the case.    In the event of Russia making a separate peace it was probable that.we should require re infercementsin order to maintain our position on the Western Front.It was generally agreed that,  in present conditions,our diplomacy should,  if possible, be used to assist the
military situation,  and that if Russia should go out ofj-  the war, every possible effort should he made to securecompensations by a separate peace with Austria;    Allusionwas -also made to the possibilities of a separate peacewith Bulgaria and Turkey, particularly in view of thepresent feeling in Russia in favour of peace withoutannexations.    It was pointed out,  however,  that if theCentral Powers considered that the withdrawal of Russiarendered victory to them probable,  it would be difficultto secure a separate peace, unless their exhaustion andgeneral desire for peace outweighed their hones of victoryCIA.uICT (3)    The T7ar Cabinet considered the question of whetherENCE ATOLM.       representatives of the British Labour and Socialistorganisations should be permitted to attend the forthcomingSocialist Conference at Stockholm.Lord Robert Cecil stated that the French ambassador had informed him that the French Government wished to pre-vent the French Minority Socialists from attending theConference,, and had invited the British Government to co-operate with them in this.    He. had replied that we shouldeo-onerate,  but he felt some misgivings on the subject.The War Cabinet were also reminded that the FrenchSocialists had only rejected the proposal to send delegatesby 2 votes.It was pointed out that all the leading GermanSocialists, including some very prominent men, would be present at the Conference, where they would meet reoresen-tat ive Russian Socialists.    If the Allies abstainedaltogether from the Conference the German representatives&quot;would impress on the Russian:   that the British Empire andFrance were alone standing in the way of peace,  and wouldhave a chance of making misrepresentations on the subject..
One difficulty arose from the uncertainty as towhether suitable British representatives would be available.The persons who were known to be anxious to attend consistedmainly of representatives of the Independent Labour Party,and included well-known pacifists,  who might do considerableharm,;     In these circumstances,  it was felt that it might be wiser to send a strong delegation from the Labour Party,who could represent our national aims in this War in theirtrue light.    It was generally agreed,  however,  thatMr.. Henderson,  though the best possible representative ofthe LSbour Party from every point of view,  could not,  as aMember of the War Cabinet&apos;attend the Conference without corn-promising our position in the eyes of the world.    It waspointed out that even though no direct result might follow from the presence of representatives of the British LabourParty,  their attendance would give unique opportunities for obtaining better information than we at present possess asto the state of affairs in Germany, and that possibly theoccasion of the Conference might be utilised to stimulate the movement towards democratic government in Germany byindicating that the allies would only discuss terras  of peacewith such a Government.Before reaching a conclusion on this subject, theWar Cabinet decided to await the results of a Conference ofthe Executive Committee of the Labour x^arty,  over.which mr. Henderson was presiding on the same afternoon, andwhich would be attended by some Members, of the Labour Partywho have opposed  the War,  and who are believed to be  com-rnitted to a policy of peace without annexations or indemnity-nities.      Mr. Henderson was asked to endeavour to ascertain:(i)    An indication of how the Pacifist Members of theLabour Party interpreted the policy of peace wi&apos;ih-out annexations or indemnities, in relation to
peoples such as those of Poland, Armenia, andthe native populations of German South-WestAfrica and German East Africa, who have no desire to live under Governments which had previously oppressed them:(ii)    Who would &quot;be  the representatives of the LabourWarty in the events of a decision to attend theConferenee.?ITISH - (4)    The Prime Minister read, to the War Cabinet a privateABOR IBGTOIJ. and personal telegram which he had received fromMr. -Balfour,  pointing out that while Sir Cecil Spring-Rice,the British Ambassador at Washington, had rendered mootadmirable service to his country, he considered it neces-sary that,  in order to,meet the immediate situation,  some person of the highest prestige and political position,should be selected as a special and permanent british representative in the United - States of America after thereturn of.his own Mission.   Mr. Balfour strongly pressedthat an effort should be made to  induce lord Grey toaccept this position.After some discussion the question was adjourned forfurther consideration.42 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.May 9,  1917.
