-JE C R E T../ / WAR CABINET 191  (a) .If! -        -MINUTES OE A MEETING HELD AT 10 DOWNING STREET,  S.W.,  ON^ FRIDAY,   JULY 20,  1917, AT 3.15 p.m.-LR POLICY.        (1)    The War Cabinet discussed the instructions to beistructions     followed by the British representatives at the forthcom-j the Brit-bh; repres-       ing Inter-Ally Conference in Paris.    They had beforertatives atae forth- them a preliminary draft of an Interim Report of thefining Parisbnference.        Cabinet Committee on War Policy, as well as three-Mem-oranda by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff deal-ing respectively with War Policy on the Western Front(W.P.43); Military Policy in the Balkans  (W.P.44), and palestine (W.P.45).OtiilTARY POLICY (2)  The War Cabinet approved that the military policyJff THE WESTERNSOUTHERN     in the Western and Southern theatres should be as follows(a) The Field Marshal Commanding the British Expedition-ary Force in France should be authorised to carryout the plans for which he has prepared, as explain-j ed by him to the Cabinet Committee on War PolicyU on June 19th:(b) If it appears probable in the execution of these plans that the results are not commensurate withthe effort made and the losses incurred,  the wholequestion should be re-examined by the War Cabinety with a view to the cessation of this offensive and the adoption of an alternative plan:fc) The only alternative plan which at present commends. itself to the Cabinet Committee is General Cadorna^proposal for a great offensive against Austria,- \ /   supported by British and,  if the French are prepar-V    ed to cooperate, by French heavy artillery:(d) In order that this alternative plan may be feasiblein the event of a decision being taken to desistfrom Field Marshal Sir Douglas Ea.lgIs plan of/   operations, arrangements should be made forthwith/    for giving effect to it; for a gradual accumula-tion of reserves of ammunition for an eventualforce of British heavy guns on the Italian front;and for all other measures that can be taken inadvance to facilitate the execution of the plan:(e) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should take  iimmediate steps to give effect to these decisions:
1 oO O(f)    Pressure should he put on the French Government to cooperate with all their forces in the forthcomingBritish offensive in Flanders;  and to send heavy-guns to Italy if the proposal in (c)  is adopted.(3)    In regard to  fc)  the War Cabinet approved a proposal bythe Chief of the Imperial General Staff that he should discussthe plan for an offensive against Austria supported by Brit-ish and, perhaps by French heavy artillery, with general cadorna and General Foch in his own way at the forthcoming conference in Paris, as an alternative plan which may become possible at a later date.It was agreed that it would be undesirable to make definitearrangements with General Gadorna at once on this question,as the fact of our doing so might induce him to postpone or,at any rate,  to -diminish the offensive operations he is nowplanning, which are of great importance in view of the successthat has attended the Russian offensive.    For the same reason it was agreed that the moment had not yet come to make any bar-gain with the Italian Government as to their continued cooper-ation in the War in the event of such a blow being struct as would induce Austria to make a separate peace.(4)    With reference to  (d),  the War Cabinet, after hearinga statement by the Master-General of the Ordnance in regardto the reserves and output of heavy artillery ammunition,take note that, for the moment, Sir Douglas Haigls probablerequirements do not admit of our sending any nature of heavyammunition other than a little 8&quot; or 9.2&quot; howitzer ammunition,if General Cadorna requires such guns,for the purpose of anaccumulation in Italy over and above the very ample suppliesof 6U howitzer ammunition already being sent for the howit-aers on the Italian Front, or about to be despatched there.(5)    The War Cabinet also take note that arrangements have .been considered by British Staff Officers, in conjunction withthe Italian and French General Staffs, for the possible transfer
Hi &amp;of troops from the Western to the Italian Fronts, and are inas advanced a state of preparation as it is possible to make them at the present time,i With reference to (f),  the War Cabinet also approved the-  proposal of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that heshould insist in the discussion with Generals Foch and Cadornaon the French contributing to any reinforcement made&apos; on theItalian Front either by supplying some of the guns, or by re-ducing the demands which we have heard are to be made upon us to take over more line.iTAEY    (6)    After a full discussion of the military situation in the:CY II\TIBAL-   Balkan and Turkish theatres of war, the War Cabinet approvedthat the military policy to be aimed at in the Balkans shouldbe as follows:-fa) The abandonment of the policy of withdrawal of the allied armies to the entrenched camp surrounding salonica:fb) The gradual withdrawal from the fighting line of as many divisions as possible of the British Army at Salon-ica,  their places being taken by Greek or other allied troops:(c) The immediate withdrawal from Salonica of one divisionas a reinforcement to the British Expeditionary Forcein Egypt:(d) The formation of the remaining divisions withdrawn fromthe fighting line into a general reserve for service inany theatre where they might be required, according as.the military situation develops.(7)    It was generally agreed that an offensive operation inthe Balkans offered but little prospect of success, and thatthe Russians could not be relied on to carry out a success-ful offensive against Bulgaria.    In this latter connection the Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegram re-ceived from French sources which indicated that the russian army was not likely to. be in a position to take the offensive in the Bobrudja.    It was also agreed that the maintenance of600,000 Allied troops in the Balkans against 300,000 Bulgar-ians is a great waste of material.vRg- pp. \ P i /,;.3.&apos;&quot; vPp/t .v&apos;g&apos;p&apos; pCVVS^ k,&apos;.,k&apos;. :     -k/      ^ ^IflB
It was pointed out, however, that the British representatives at Paris might find themselves in a very difficult positionin pressing the policy laid down ahove.    The Russian repres-representatives might insist that a Russian offensive would be suc-cessful, and would press strongly for cooperation from Salonica,and they would be supported by the Serbians and Greeks, prob-ably also by the French, and possibly by the Italians.    Adirect refusal to cooperate in an offensive might have ser-ious political consequences.The War Cabinet,  therefore, decided that some latitudemust he left to their representatives who, however,  shouldmake the most of the facts that we&apos;are sustaining the bruntof the War against Turkey;  that we cannot at present fore-see the developments in the Turkish theatres;  that in viewof the failure of the Russian offensive in the Caucasus todevelop,  it is impossible to foresee where the reinforcementsmay be required; that for this reason it is essential to usto have a reserve immediately available, which at present wedo not possess; and that for the. present there is no intentionof removing more than the one division to be transferred to egypt.    Further, with a view to meeting any such combination of the Allied representatives at the Conference as has been referred to, great stress was laid upon the desirability, ifpossible, of coming to a preliminary understanding with theFrench Government.(8)    The War Cabinet agreed with the Chief of the Imperial, General Staff that, until it was in possession of particu- -lars of the tonnage required to meet General AllenbyTs pro-posals, and was assured of our power to supply this tonnage and meet our other essential shipping requirements, no de-cision could be taken as regards the proposed offensive inPalestine.    In addition to the despatch of one division from
Salonica they decided that the doubling of the railway east of the Suez Canal should be at once proceeded with, subjectto what may be ascertained in regard to the water-pipes;that General Allenby&apos;s present force should be made up to strength in all possible respects; that pending a final de-cision General Allenby should be instructed to take any ad-vantage offered of pressing the Turks, and to be as activeas his means permit so as indirectly to assist General Maudejiftehall Gardens, S.W. ,July 20, 1917.
