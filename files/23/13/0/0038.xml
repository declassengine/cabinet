WAR CABINET 345a.

Minutes of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street, on THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1918, at 12.30 p.m.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF and THE PERMANENT MILITARY ADVISER AT VERSAILLES.

With reference to War Cabinet 344a, the War Cabinet continued their discussion on the question of the attitude of General Sir William Robertson towards the arrangement entered into at the  last Meeting of the Supreme War Council at Versailles for the control of the General Reserve of the Allies on the Western and Italian Fronts.

General Sir William Robertson attended and made a full statement of his position in the matter, after which he withdrew. (Appendix).

In the subsequent discussion it was pointed out that it was essential that the General Reserves of the Allies on the Western and Italian Fronts should be controlled by a Higher Command which was in close and immediate touch with each of the Allied forces concerned. Under the scheme agreed to at Versailles, this was provided for, firstly, by the creation of an Executive composed of the Permanent Military Representatives of the various nations concerned at Versailles (with General Foch for France in the Chair), and, secondly, by the fact that the Executive was within a few hours’ distance by motor-car of the Headquarters of three of the Armies concerned. The principal objections to General Robertson’s scheme of placing the Reserves under the control of the Chiefs of Staff of the various nations were:-

General Robertson is being given an opportunity to correct this statement before it is circulated.


(1) That the British and Italian Chiefs of Staff were not in such close touch as the Permanent Military Representative at Versailles with the Allied Armies of other nations; and

(2) That they were not always on the spot and ready to take immediate decision.

In regard to an objection that had been raised to the Supreme War Council&apos;s scheme that the British Commander-in-Chief would be receiving orders from the British Permanent Military Representative, it was pointed out that the British Permanent Military Representative would, in fact, be transmitting, not his own orders, but those of the whole of the Inter-Allied Executive, and that these orders would apply just as much to the French, American, and Italian Armies as to the British.

It was further pointed out that in reality the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force was far more affected by the Scheme than the Chief of the Imperial General staff. Up to the present time the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had exercised no influence on the disposal of the British Reserves within French territory, where the main attack of the enemy was now anticipated. Such control had remained entirely in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, who would now be asked to surrender a portion of his Reserves into the control of the Inter-Allied Executive Commanding the Reserves. It was for this reason that, at the end of the previous week, Field Marshal Haig had been asked to visit England, and he had agreed to the scheme, although the Secretary of State for War pointed out it was possible that his acceptance was influenced in some degree by his belief that General Robertson would be the British Permanent Military Representative at Versailles.

SECRET

Statement by General Sir William Robertson.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff began by thanking the Prime Minister for the opportunity of making a statement to the War Cabinet. He urged the importance of an early settlement of the question, since all work was at present being neglected and action was required in regard to the campaign both in the East and in the West. General Robertson wished to ensure the War Cabinet that no personal or political question had ever entered into his mind in dealing with this question. The main question was that of the General Reserve of the Allies. In regard to this, he accepted the general principle for the establishment of a Reserve whole-heartedly. There was no conflict as regards policy, but only as to the military method of giving effect to it. He himself had, in fact, been working on the subject for weeks, and even before the recent meeting of the Supreme War Council had summoned a meeting of Allied Generals at Compiegne, in order to urge the creation of this Reserve. Consequently, on the general principle he was not in the least in opposition to the policy of the War Cabinet. General Robertson then asked the War Cabinet to pardon him if he had to speak somewhat plainly and even abruptly. The first question which he suggested as a practical proposition for the Cabinet to decide was whether he really was the right man they wished to have as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and their Supreme Military Adviser. During the forthcoming summer we would have a very hard time before us. He thought that in the end, provided our drafts were not allowed to run down too low, we should be able to stand the enemy&apos;s attacks and should pull through, but, nevetheless, we must look forward to a very difficult time. Consequently, it was vital that the War Cabinet should feel no doubts in regard to their principle Military Adviser. If they did feel such doubts, he himself would have no complaint.


and if he were told that such doubts existed, no remark would be said on his part. And if on that account he had to leave his present appointment, the War Cabinet need fear no trouble from him.

For the moment, however, he would  assume that the War Cabinet had full confidence in him since they had asked him to remain Chief of the Imperial General Staff and their Supreme Military Adviser. The next point in his statement would be to show that his advice had throughout this matter been consistent. To show this it was necessary to sum up the history of the last fortnight.

As he had already stated, he believed fully in the principle of the establishment of a General Reserve for the Allies on the Western and Italian Fronts. Before the last meeting of the Supreme War Council, the Prime Minister, Lord Milner, and the British Military Representatives present had discussed the matter, and he then expressed his opinion that the Chiefs of the General Staffs were the proper persons to control the Reserves, and by the Prime Minister&apos;s request he had sent him a note on the subject the following day. In this he dealt at length with the subject, making the same suggestion as to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and explaining the reasons why we could not have a Generalissimo.

Paragraph II of this note read as follows:-

"The advice I submit to you is, therefore, that the High Command, as far as executive work is concerned (and this is what matters most during active operations), must necessarily be exercised by the Chiefs of the General Staff, the responsible and authoritative advisers and executive officers of the Governments."

On the following day he had met Field Marshal Haig and Generals Petain and Foch, and had shown them this Memorandum, in which they had all three generally concurred, and it was decided that General Foch should lay the proposal before the Supreme War Council when the question came up.

THE PRIME MINISTER, at this point, asked whether the Permanent Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council had been present this meeting?

GENERAL ROBERTSON replied in this negative.




Continuing this statement, General Robertson said that General Foch 



eventually put before the Supreme War Council in general terms the 



scheme indicated in the quotation given above, and agreed to by the 



four Generals. This was discussed for some time, and then the 



Supreme War Council had adjourned for tea, in order to give time for 



a definite scheme to be drafted. The scheme, as drafted by French 



Officers under General Foch&apos;s supervision, had been hastily 



prepared, and he agreed had gone too far. Consequently, it was not 



accepted on the reassembly of the Supreme War Council, which had then 



adjourned. Before the adjournment M. Clemenceau had asked that all 



those present should think the matter over with a view to the 



preparation of a fresh draft, and in this connection one of those 



present - (THE PRIME MINISTER said it was Signor Orlando) -  had thrown 



out the suggestion that the Higher Command of the Reserves might be 



entrusted to the Permanent Military Representatives of the Supreme 



War Council. That evening General Robertson had prepared a new 



project in lieu of General Foch&apos;s draft, but keeping to the 



principle of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff exercising 



control, and had forwarded it early the following morning to the 



Prime Minister. He had also prepared a further note on the subject 



for the Prime Minister, and sent it to him before the next meeting. 



From it he read the following quotation:-

"With us the case is different. No British officer in France who is 



not a Member of the Army Council and in direct touch with that body 



can have the necessary information as to the state of the troops, 



the supply, munition and medical situation and other questions 



essential to the effective control of military operations. On these 



questions I feel that both the Secretary of State for War and the Army 



Council should be consulted, as they affect vitally the principles 



of command and administration of our troops in the field."

  He himself had been staying at Paris, while the Prime Minister was 



staying at Versailles, and there was consequently no opportunity to 



discuss the matter before the re-assembly of the Supreme War 



Council. In the meanwhile, the Prime Minister had provided himself 



with his own draft, which had, subject to minor alterations, been 



accepted by the Supreme War Council, and subsequently by the War 



Cabinet. At this meeting of the Supreme War Council General 


Robertson had not considered it necessary to protest against this draft, his reasons being that he was not a Member of the Supreme War Council, the Prime Minister was already fully acquainted with his views, and the whole Council had heard him the previous day support the proposal put forward by General Foch for the Chiefs of the General Staffs to control the Reserves.



 After the conclusion of the Meeting of the Supreme War Council, the scheme for the control of the Reserves had been considered by the Army Council, who had criticized it in a Minute from which he quoted the following:-



(3) Constitutionally the Army Council are responsible for the safety and welfare of the British Army. The Powers conferred on the Executive Committee, however, will enable it to disregard the Army Council, in that it is allowed to interpose directly between the Council and the Commanders-in-Chief.



(4) In regard to the position of Commanders-in-Chief, it must be remembered that they are responsible, through the Army Council, for carrying out the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, while under the system now established they would be given orders affecting their operations by two different authorities, the Executive Committee and the Army Council. This system could not fail to cause dangerous confusion and complication in the conduct of the operations.



(5) The Army Council therefore consider that the constitution of the Executive Committee as it now stands would not only place Commanders-in-Chief in an impossible position, but would also deprive the Council of the responsibility entrusted to them under the Constitution of the Realm, and that any such abrogation of that responsibility would be a violation of the trust reposed in them."

This was sent to the War Cabinet, he believed.

 

GENERAL ROBERTSON had, at the same Army Council Meeting, taken the initiative in urging the Army Council not to leave the matter there, and a discussion took place as to the means whereby effect could be given to the Versailles decision. He did not know whether the result of this discussion was put forward to the War Cabinet.

 

LORD DERBY said it was not.



GENERAL ROBERTSON, continuing, said that later the matter was referred back to the Army Council and the constitutional part of it was regularised. The Army Council had then agreed to a Minute from which he quoted the following:- 
"The Army Council have considered this note. They agree that the 



proposals contained in it would be within the scope of the Council&apos;s 



constitutional powers provided that the military forces of the 



Empire remain as at present for purposes of discipline. The Council 



agree that the Military Representative at Versailles should be a 



Member of the Army Council: but the Military Members of the Council 



consider that the officer holding the appointment of Chief of the 



Imperial General Staff at any time should be the Military 



Representative at Versailles."



He understood that this Minute had been communicated to the War 



Cabinet. At the end of last week General Robertson said he had been 



indisposed, and under doctor&apos;s orders had been away. On Monday the 



11th on return to London, he was informed by the Secretary of State 



for War that on Saturday, during his absence, a new proposal had 



been made, that he was to be replaced by General Wilson as Chief of 



the Imperial General Staff, and he himself was to go to Versailles. 



He had nothing to say on the personal aspect of this exchange of 



posts. When the document containing this proposal was sent to him he 



had sent a Minute to Lord Derby, from which he quoted the 



following:-



 "It seems to me absolutely necessary that the General Staff officer 



who is to give orders regarding the reserves in question, must be in 



constant and direct touch with the various departments of the War 



Office - the Great Head-quarters of the Imperial Military Forces - 



and be directly served by, and in close touch with, the Intelligence 



Branch of the General Staff. Only the C.I.G.S., residing normally at 



the War Office, can be in this position, and for an officer who is 



not in that position to attempt to interfere with the employment and 



location of Reserve troops under the British Commanders-in-Chief in 



France, Italy, and the Balkans, upon the right use of which final 



victory depends, would inevitably lead to confusion and perhaps to 



disaster. So strongly am I convinced of this that I am compelled to 



say that I cannot undertake the very great responsibility involved. 



I say this with the deepest regret because I am keenly desirous of 



doing my utmost to assist His Majesty&apos;s Government in their very 



difficult task of winning the War, but on reconsideration I feel 



sure that you will see that it is asking too much of me to carry out 



and perpetuate a system which the A.G.,  M.G.O., D.C.I.G.S., and 



myself consider to be fundamentally defective."



He had written the above Minute in spite of the fact that in 



declining the responsibility of the post at Versailles under the 



system proposed, he was making, as he had already been told that he 



was being replaced as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, a very 



great personal sacrifice at the end of a long and rather hard




military career. Now he was asked to remain on as Chief of the 



Imperial General Staff, the same system to obtain as regards control 



of the Reserves. But he put it to the war Cabinet: How could he, as 



Chief of the Imperial General Staff, accept a system which, when 



asked to go to Versailles, he had condemned as unworkable and 



dangerous?



In his view, the only workable and safe method of controlling the 



Reserves was for the Chief of the Imperial General Staff himself to 



be a Member of the controlling body at Versailles. He could see no 



difficulty about working such a system as he had pointed out in the 



following extract from a letter to Lord Derby:-



"There need be no difficulty in the C.I.G.S., being represented on 



the Executive body; in his absence, by a Deputy who would keep him 



fully informed of the work of the Executive, warn him when his 



presence was required, and act for him in case of necessity. Nothing 



in this arrangement need in any way affect the position or duties of 



the British Military Representative to the Supreme War Council. The 



Deputy, if desired, could be made an army Counciller, as in the case 



of the present D.C.I.G.S., at the War Office, and he could further, 



if desired, be British Military Representative on the Supreme War 



Council."



He understood that Field Marshal Haig had agreed in the Government&apos;s 



proposed method for carrying out the Versailles policy, but he 



certainly had not told him so when they discussed it together at 



Paris. He suggested that this agreement was probably, in part, due 



to the fact that Sir Douglas Haig was at the time under the 



impression that General Robertson was going to Versailles. Moreover, 



he pointed out that Field Marshal Haig was less affected than he 



was.



As regard to the objection to his own proposal, that the work of the 



British Representative on the Executive controlling the Reserves 



required the full time of one man, he could only state his 



disagreement. This depended entirely upon how the work to be done 



was visualised, and in his view it had been visualised entirely 



wrongly. There were millions of men on the front, and but very few 



orders would be required from Versailles, and these not rapid ones. 



He had had a long talk with General Wilson about it who, however, 



did not agree with this view, and General Robertson further pointed 



out that General Ludendorff had succeeded in controlling


the whole of the German Reserves on both the Eastern and the Western front, and he did not remain permanently in one place. In Genera1 Robertson&apos;s opinion &amp; wrong view was being taken of the functions of the Permanent Military Representatives. He gathered that they intended to take a much greater part in the actual battle than they ought to take. The fighting ought to be left to the two Commanders-in-chief. If Versailles interferred too much in the battle there would assuredly be trouble. Nevertheless, if the Government decided that it must be a full-time appointment, he submitted that their wishes were amply met by having a Deputy to the Chief of the Imperial General staff who could carry on when he was not present.

What he dreaded above all was divided responsibility.

The PRIME MINISTER, at this point, asked whether, if General Robertson&apos;s proposal were adopted he would be prepared to become the Deputy at Versailles to General Wilson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff?

GENERAL ROBERTSON asked to postpone his answer for a few minute in order that he that he might first conclude his statement.

To sum up: we had before us a very difficult task; we must expect great losses; and we could only face the situation if everything was in the best possible working order. The question was not one of whether he himself should go to Versailles or should remain as Chief of the Imperial General Staff; it was a question of having a proper system. In his view the system of control agreed to by the Supreme War Council was in our case dangerous and unworkable, and further that any compromise between his own proposal and the Supreme War Council&apos;s proposal would  be even worse, as no one might then be responsible for anything. If the War Cabinet could not accept his advice, he suggested they must consider the following points:-

(1) Whether he really was the right man to remain as their supreme Military Adviser?

(2) If, nevertheless, they preferred to retain him, would it be wise from their point of view to entrust him with carrying out a system, or would it be fair to ask him to assume the responsibility for working a system, which he regarded as dangerous and unworkable?




He asked the War Cabinet to believe that everything that he had said had been solely from a sense of duty, and he had said it with reluctance.

Replying to the Prime Minister&apos;s question given above, General Robertson asked that he might not be sent to Versailles to work as Deputy to General Wilson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He pointed out that he had been a full General for nearly two years, while General Wilson was only a temporary General. He hoped that regard would be had to this and that he would not be asked to take such an appointment.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that General Robertson had stated his case very fairly and in a most impressive manner. It would be considered by the War Cabinet with every desire to retain his service consistently with adherence to the decisions taken by the Supreme War Council at Versailles. It was very important that an early decision should be reached, and he hoped that it would be possible to settle the question consistently with the retention of the very valuable services of General Sir William Robertson.

(GENERAL ROBERTSON then withdrew).
