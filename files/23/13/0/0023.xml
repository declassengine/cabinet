Lord Curzon read to the War Cabinet a letter he had receiv-ed from the Archbishop of Canterbury, enclosing a letter,which Lord Curzon also read, from Dr. Bernard, the AnglicanArchbishop of Dublin.    Dr. Bernard, in his letter, expressedpessimistic views regarding the prospects of the convention which, in his opinion, had receded, largely owing to the weakness of the Government of Ireland, which he criticisedadversely.    Other opinions were quoted in the course of thediscussion criticising the Irish administration as being aweak one.    On the other hand, the view was expressed that dr. Bernard&quot;s opinion was not supported by evidence of any great value.There was some discussion as to the desirability of making it clear that a system of self-government such as has been accorded to the Dominions could not be granted to Ireland,but the War Cabinet were reminded that they had previouslydecided not to exclude self-government in this form from ex-amination by the Convention.The discussion was adjourned owing to the receipt by thePrime Minister of a request from Mr. Redmond to see him.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 17, 1917.
