These details were contained In a separate document communicated to theWar Office.    Generally speaking, the position was as fol-lows.    The enemy in front of General Allenby was weak andin. a difficult situation, owing to the necessity of having to retreat through the bottle neck of the railway up theYarmuk valley. -  He was, therefore, not likely to make a determined stand and might, in fact, be already retiring.Consequently, General Allenby should have no difficultywhatever in reaching the line Haifa-Tiberias-Yarm.uk Yalleywith his present forces.    The date at which he could do this depended entirely on the rate of construction of hisrailway.    It was 65 miles to Haifa and that at half a milea day this meant over four months, and at two miles a days quarter of that time.    The earlier General Allenby could get to Haifa the better, in order to give him time to de-velop the capacities of Haifa and make preparations for thefurther advance.    At any rate, he ought to be on that lineby June.The next stage of the advance was based on the idea that the main body of the force should move along the coastsupported by both the sea and the broad gauge railway. Thefirst objective would be Beirut, 95 miles from Haifa, andit might be possible to strike from Beirut across the mountains in rear of Damascus.    But probably it would bea   0 i... 1 a
O 1 -JLa better plan, and. General Allenby agreed with, this view, to push another 50 miles on to Tripoli, and turn the Turkish pos-ition through the Tripoli-Horns gap.    In this way we shouldbe continually out-flanking the enemy1s position, and achieveby a different method very much the same kind of result as would be achieved by an independent landing on the coast be-hind the enemy1s lines.    The other column would be advancinginland by Deraa, taking care, however, not to commit itself toefar and risk a counter-stroke in force.    Between the two a force, which for transport reasons could not very well ex-ceed two divisions, could push along the road passing throughthe Hills of Galilee and so to Damascus across the Upper Jor-dan.    He considered that by an advance on these lines theDamascus position would be turned by the autumn, if not be-fore, so that Damascus could be entered by our inland columns.As regards the climate, the information he had from Gen-eral Allenby was that it was good enough to permit of con-tinuous operations throughout the summer, even on the coast.The only part where white troops could not operate in the sum-mer was the Jordan valley.The Ghief of the Imperial General Staff explained thatthe shipping available for bringing troops from Mesopotamiawould only allow of one division, and of the howitzers beingbror-ght to Palestine before the hot weather.    It was practi-callyout of the question moving the other division and the cavalry brigade in the hot weather.    He did not consider thatthis made any difference, as General allenby maximum re-requirement for troops, would notjsome till late in^he^autumn,so that the second division could, if required,/still be broughtround then.   Apart from this there were 24 Native battalionswhich had been raised in India and were being sent to Palestine,
9 o 9O *-wand another SI in process of being raised, who were also ear-marked for the same destination.    Over 40 battalions, in fact,a very substantial reinforcement/would reach General Allenbyduring the summer and autumn.    Further, there were 11 Indiancavalry regiments now on their way from France.    AltogetherGeneral Allenby had at present more troops than he could ha,ndle,and ample, without any reinforcement, to bring him to theHaifa-Tiberias line.    He had enough, in fact, to enable himto put some of his white troops in reserve d.uring the hottermonths.Besides this the French were also anxiop-s to send theirLegion d&quot;Orient, composed of Armenian and Syrian battalions,from Cyprus, and a force of spies.    He had asked general foch to defer sending these till we shoiild reach Tripoli,,As regards the position in North-Western PefSia, he eon-sidered that General Marshall should be quite able to dealwith this, even after sending a division to Palestine.    Heoould, moreover, be reinforced in an emergency by some of thenew battalions from India.    It could then be seen in the aut-umn whether the additional division could be spared for Pal-estineeAs regards the demands for rolling-stock laid down in theReport, and the shipping required to convey it to Egypt, he understood that 17 engines and 300 trucks ?/ere required atonce, and that 150 engines and 3,000 trucks eventually. Thiswas besides the 40 engines and rolling-stock for the narrowgauge line which he understood had already been ordered. he gathered that Sir Guy Granet could find this quantity of rol-ling-stock, under certain conditions, but that the Ministryof Shipping raised serious difficulties about the possibilityof finding the 68 ships which they considered would be re-quired for this purpose.
0 1 0&apos;  O OIn the discussion which followed it was pointed out thatthe requirements were in any case spread over a great numberof months, and that the rolling-stock, instead of being car-ried as useless deadweight, could go across by train ferrycarrying coal to Italy.    The empty trucks could then be ship-ped on from Taranto.    The engines, owing to the inadequacy of the handling arrangements at Taranto, would hare to be shipped at Marseilles.As regards the requirements for rolling-stock, Sir GuyGranet pointed out that the engines and trucks in question had originally been destined for Prance, and would still be needed if the American arrangements collapsed.    He consider-ed that the situation in this respect, and as regards ship-ping, would be greatly improved if the Americans could be induced to modify their present 1918 programme to one of aless ambitious character, enabling a larger amount of reallyessential things, like rolling-stock, to be sent over.    Gen-eral Nash also pointed out that the sending of coal by railacross Prance made it more difficult to spare rolling-stock.The general view of the Cabinet, however, was that asthe demands were spread over a considerable time, there wasnot sufficient reason for abandoning the policy advocated for fear of an American breakdown, which, after all, it was thebusiness of the Americans to rectify.With regard to the 2 Canadian construction battalionswhose immediate despatch was urged in the Report, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff stated that General Nash wasvery reluctant to part Vifith them.    If there was any collapseon the French front it would be necessary for him to convertCreil into a gare regulatrice, and for this he would requireall the railway construction personnel available.    The Chiefof the Imperial General Staff suggested that Canada shouldbe asked to furnish an additional two battalions, and that meanwhile the Italians should be asked to send 2 battalions to palestine at once.
With regard to this latter suggestion, it was generally felt in the Cabinet that it was undesirable to bring the It-alians more into our operations in that quarter than was inevitable, and that it would be preferable to employ theItalians in France in substitution of Canadians sent to Pal-estine.    It was a,lso suggested that while the Italians could do the work of the Canadians in France, they might be lesscapable of organising Egyptian labour under thenuthan Canadianor British troops.General Ifesh explained that the difficulty lay in spar-ing the S battalions at once.    There were 140 miles of con-struction being carried out at this moment, and he was not certain what would be the effect upon this work of withdrawing  battalions from the present total of IE Canadian battalions and 9,000 British construction troops.    If withdrawn theywould have to be replaced.    Italian construction troops might possibly serve this purpose, and he had Engineer Officersused to working with Italians.    At the same time, he found the Canadians the only troops who would work steadily and con-tinuously under shell-fire.    The British construction troops were now largely &quot;B!T men, and not capable of the same degreeof effort, nor was he sure that the Italians would do as wellunder shell-fire.    He feared a loss of efficiency which thesituation on the Western Front could not a.fford.    He was, how-ever, going over that day to see Sir Douglas Hadg, and under-took to see if the battalions could&apos; possibly be spared.    Hesuggested that there were plenty of highly skilled Canadianrailwaymen in Canada and the United States from whom addition-al battalions could rapidly be formed.In the discussion which followed it was generally agreedthat if additional battalions, Canadian or American, couldbe raised, to. replace Canadian battalions now on the western front, then these latter could be-despatched, providing there

The Ghigf of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that he was seeing the Canadian Authorft-ies that afternoon in the matter.General Stewart, Commanding the Canadian Construction.Oj        Battalions, explained that when he left the Western Front amonth ago the   &quot;battalions in question could have &quot;been quiteeasily spared.    He could, not, of course, speak with authority as regards the position at that moment.    He did not think there would &quot;be any difficulty In raising additional battal-ions in Canada if the British Government asked for them. Hethought the Canadian &quot;battalions would be specially useful inPalestine, /because of their experience in the rapid, building of wooden bridges.   As -regards working steadily under shell-fires or dealing with &quot;natives, he thought that the Britishconstruction troops were just as good.The War cabinet approved the recommendations contained in General-^-&quot;&quot;-/&apos;       Smuts&quot; SepojdFJ and requested General Smuts to take *....... -ji;;,&quot; in hand, the necessary arrangements with the War Of-fice, the Admiralty, and the Shipping Controller,I    for their execution, referring to the War Cabinet,^     if necessary.The War Cabinet also:-&quot;Requested the Chief of the Imperial General staff to do his best with the Canadian authorities to se-eure the immediate raising of two additional rail-way construction battalions in Canada.
