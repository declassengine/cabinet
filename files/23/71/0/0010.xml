MALTA. l.The Cabinet had before there the followingConstitution Memoranda by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesBill.on the subject of the situation in Malta:-(previous reference: C.P.-172 (32) circulating for theCabinet 28 consideration of his colleagues -(02), Con- (l) A secret telegram, from&quot;the-elusion 9.) Governor of Malta, dated May27th, submitting representa-tions regarding the3d($?\\0. Cabinet decision on Maltareferred to in the margin:(2) A further telegram from theGovernor transmitting theviews of the ConstitutionalParty (Lord Strickland&apos;s Party)and the Labour Party, both ofwhom urge that the Electionsshould be allowed to proceednotwithstanding the ins true-tions in the Circular issuedby the Maltese Bishops;    and(.3) An ad. interim telegraphic replysent to the Governor on the evening of May 27th.C.P.-174 (32) circulating for theinformation of his colleagues the text of the Private Notice Questionwhich it had been proposed should beasked in the House of Commons onMonday, May 30th, which had beenagreed with the Lord President ofthe Council and. the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.    ThisQ/uestion, however, had been postponedin view of the telegrams receivedfrom the Governor of Malta, whichhad been circulated to the Cabinetin C .P.-172 (32) ,G.P.-177 (32) covering paraphrasesof recent telegraphic correspondence with the Governor of Malta.The principal new factors since the previous decision of the Cabinet, referred to in the margin,may be summed up as follows:-(l) A message from the Secretaries ofthe Malta Constitutional and LabourParties endorsing the views of theleaders of those parties in favourof the holding of the elections in malta, notwithstanding the Bishops&apos;Circular reaffirming the &quot;mortal sin&quot;Pastoral of May, 1930. (C.P.-172 (32),page 4).(2) The Governor&apos;s repeated reaffirmationsof his original view in favour of allowing the election   to take place(C.P.-172 (32), page 2, and C.P.-177(32), pages 10, 13 and 14).
(3) Lord Strickland/s apology, accepted bythe Archbishop;    the Bishop of Gozo&apos;departure to Rome with a strongrecommendation to the Vatican fromthe Archbishop in favour of its acceptance; and the Governor&apos;santicipation that a new Pastoral wouldbe issued by the Bishops within a week(CP.-177 ( 32), page 14).The Cabinet were informed that the Prime minister had notified that had he been present he would haveassociated himself with the previous decision of theCabinet, and that, after seeing the telegramscontained in C.P.-172 (32)  (but not those in CP.-177(32), which had not yet reached him), he had tele-phoned from LossiemOuth the following expression ofhis views:-The Prime Minister is ratherimpressed by what the Governorsays and by one or two of thepoints in the petition.    If theLabour and Constitutional partiesreally want to fight it might be a mistake for us to prevent them,more especially as the Bishopshave not been changed by the suspension which has taken place.If we sanction the election, thePrime Minister would agree with theGovernor that we should express ourdisappointment at the Bishop&apos;s action,but say we propose to allow the political,parties to test their strength.The Prime Minister thinks&apos; we should then publish as a White Paper the bishop&quot;s manifesto, and see that the widest notice is taken of it in ourPress .If the Cabinet, having the advantageof a much closer examination of the issues than he can get by merelyreading a paper, decide to over-ridethe Governor, he will support them.In that event he would like, for hisown guidance, a special report of thediscussion from Sir Maurice Hankey.The Secretary of State for the Colonies alsocommunicated to the Cabinet, in the strictestconfidence, a summary of the views formed by a former experienced Governor of Malta after seeing
There was general agreement that,  so long asthe Circular of May 20,  1932, reaffirming the Pastoralof May 1, 1930, remained, valid, the previous decisionof the Cabinet,that the Constitution of Malta should remain suspended and that no Election should be held,must be adhered to, since, so long as that conditionprevailed a genuine election could not take place.The questions of what shotild be the nature of theannouncement and when it should be made were foundto present greater difficulties .One possible course was to suspendall action until a new Pastoral was issued, and. then to take a decisionaccording to whether its tenoradmitted of a genuine election ornot .   This would enable the Bishopsto issue a new Pastoral, without being subjected to pressure.The difficulty of this course was felt to be that although, constitutionally,the Governor was not bound to fix theday for polling immediately, his .decision could not be postponedindefinitely, since the v/rits hadbeen issued and the candidatesnominated some three weeks ago andthe election campaign was in progress.There would be ground for legitimatecomplaint if a decision was longpostponed&quot;    and if the election campaign, with its attendant expense,were allowed to drag on, the Government&apos;scase for suspending the election would get weaker every day.   Yet, after theexperience.of the Royal Commission,no-one could say for certain whetheror when a new Pastoral would be -issued,much less what it would contain.It might once more reaffirm the Pastoralof May, 1930, or even prove to be asubtle.document drawn in such terms asto effect, its purpose but without-justifying the suspension of theelection.A second course discussed was to make an announcement in Parliament at onceon the lines of the draft contained inC.P.-174 (32)    but indicating thatthe Governments decision would be modified if the Bishops were to issue a new Pastoral of the type contemplated by the Royal Commission.    This, at anyrate, would have the advantage of making
clear from the first the true nature ofthe Bishops&apos; action and of anticipatingany document of the nature just referredto.    It was felt, however, that the bishops would be unable to acceptdictation of this kind;    that no newPastoral would be issued;    and thatthe Government would be accused, of having taken this step, at a moment when they knew the Bishops were proposing to issue a new Pastoral,with the object of making it impossi-ble for the Bishops to do so and ofthus preventing the election.A third course was to make no immediate announcement, but to instruct theGovernor to notify confidentially tothe Archbishop, or the three party leaders, or to all four, whetherofficially or unofficially, thatthe election would not be allowed totake place unless the Circular of May80th was withdrawn.    It was felt,however, that this course was opento insuperable objections, and thatthe action of the Governor would be certain to become known in Malta.On the whole, the Cabinet felt that the course open to least objection was to make an announcement on Wednesday, June 1st, of an interim character, tothe effect that if the Election were to be held under the conditions created by the Bishops&apos; Circularof May 1st the Government would feel bound to suspend it;    but that, in view of the possibilityof a change in the situation, no final decisions would be taken or announced until next week.    Subjectto the Prime Minister&apos;s agreement., the Cabinet decidedto adopt this course.The decision; of the Cabinet may be summed up asfollows:-(a) That so long as the Circular of May 20 th.,reaffirming the Pastoral of May 1, 1930,remained valid, the previous decision ofthe Cabinet,that the Constitution of Maltashould remain suspended and that theElection should not be held, must bemaintained:(b) That, subject to the Prime Minister^concurrence, an announcement should bemade, in reply to a Question in the
House of Commons on Wednesday, June 1st,to the following effect:-The Government have been consider-ing the situation arising out of the circular issued by the Bishops onMay 20th, reaffirming the Pastoralissued on May 1,  1930.If these were the conditions inwhich an Election would be held, theGovernment would be bound to follow the course taken by their predecessorsin similar circumstances and to suspend the Election.In view, however, of the possibilities-ity of a change in the situation, no final decision will be taken orannounced until next week.(NOTE BY THE SECRETARY.    The situation was explained to the Prime Minister,at Lossiemouth,. by telephone, andthe above formula was read to himimmediately after the Cabinet Meeting.The Prime Minister expressed agree-ment in the course proposed.)(c) That,  if the Circular of May 20th wasnot withdrawn or replaced by a satisfactoryPastoral by the beginning of next week,a statement should be made in parliament on the lines, mutatis mutandis, of thedraft contained in C.P.-174 (32):(d) That,  if the Election should be suspended,it would probably be necessary to take steps to comply with the request of theGovernor In his Secret telegram No.69(C.P.-177 (32), page 7) for&quot;the passageof a short Act validating the 1930Letters Patent and everything donethereunder:(e) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should explain the situation to the Governor of Malta.
