XJ MEETING 1. The Lord President of the Council pointedCABINET.out that some of the important questions on theAgenda Paper for the present Meeting ought not tohe settled in the absence of the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    He. thought there was a reasonable chance of the Prime Ministerbeing back in London on the morning of Tuesday,June 7th,   He gathered also that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would return on an early day next week.The Cabinet were reminded that, owing to theunveiling of the Queen Alexandra Memorial,  it wouldbe necessary to hold the weekly Meeting of theCabinet    next week at 10 a.m.As the discussion on Disarmament, referred tobelow, showed that a good deal of time was likelyto be necessary for consideration of that subject,the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Lord President of theCouncil, on their behalf, should suggest to the Prime Minister thedesirability of holding a special meeting of the Cabinet on the after-noon of Tuesday, June 7th:(b) That the next regular weekly Meetingof the Cabinet should take place onWednesday, June 8th, AT 10 A.M..
oposed Inter-tionalnference.eviouseference:cabinet 6751), Oon-conclusion 3.)2. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a press message from Washington reporting that theState Department yesterday issued the following statement:-&quot;A suggestion that there shouldbe called an international conference for the purpose of considering methods to stabilize world commodity prices was first brought to the attention ofthe Government by the inquiry of theBritish Ambassador in Washington asto whether we should be interested and would participate in such aconference,The suggestion was that it shouldbe called by the British in London,After serious consideration theGovernment replied through Mr Mellon,the Ambassador in London.    It feltthat an early convocation of such aconference might be of real value inthe present depression.11The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat this announcement had taken everyone by surpriseThe actual facts were as follows:-   On May 11th theExchange Telegraph Company had telegraphed from washington a report that according to a high officialthe Administration would, be willing to take part inan International Conference on Monetary Problems, ashad been suggested by Mr Winston Churchill in a speech in Parliament.   The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had immediately asked the british ambassador in Washington to ascertain whether this message represented the attitude of the United states administration,    In instructing the Ambassador as tothe line he shoiild take, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had pointed out that the referenceto the Lausanne Conference included &quot;The measures&quot;necessary to solve the.other economic and financial&quot;difficulties which are responsible for and may&quot;prolong the present world crisis&quot;, and had askedwhether it would not be possible for the United
States to be represented at the second stage of the lausanne Conference to discuss these matters.    the ambassador had replied that the &quot;high official&quot;was Mr Castle, of the State Department;    that thePresident was rather sceptical but would be interestedif His Majesty&apos;s Government were to convoke one ona definite Agenda, excluding War Debts and Repara-tions.Subsequently, on May 25th,  there had been a telephone conversation between the Prime Ministerand Mr Stimson, a record of which was read to theCabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.This conversation, as shown by the record, had been strictly confidential, and &quot;without prejudice&quot;.As the result- of the Prime minister&apos;s conversationby telephone, the Secretary of State had had. an interview with the American Ambassador during thepresent week, of which he read to the Cabinet amemorandum.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he would have to answer aPrivate Notice Question on the subject the same afternoon.The general view of the Cabinet was that althoughthe American announcement was premature and inaccuratein detail, on merits there was a good deal to be said for the proposed Conference, provided that it was found possible to fit it in with the large numberof Conferences in which His Majesty&apos;s Government was already concerned,    It was important to take no action which would alienate the favourable attitvxdeof the United States Government towards the proposed conference, but at the same time it was impossibleto be definite, since nothing had been worked out
in detail, and the French and Italian governments had not even been informed of these conversations..The Cabinet agreed  fa) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, after consulta-tion with the Secretary of Statefor War (who had made somesuggestions on the subject), should draft an anno\;.ncement to be made inParliament the same afternoon inreply to a Private Notice Question,conceived on the broad lines suggested above.(NOTE: A copy of the statement by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs isattached in the Appendix,)(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take such steps as he deemed appropriate to acquaint the other Governmentsconcerned of the position.
REIGN POLICY.0licy of Prance.5.   The Cabinet took note of a-Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-179(32)) covering Notes prepared in the Foreign Officeand His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Paris, which summarisedimpressions gleaned there by the British ambassador on the likely policy of the new French Governmenton External Questions.
2 mDISARMAMENT. 4. The Cabinet had before them the following general Policy documents on Disarmament Policy, including air and Air Policy.Policy :-(Previous A Most Secret Memorandum by the reference: Secretary of State for ForeignCabinet 27 Affairs (C.P.-164 (32))  covering(32), Con- the following:-clusion 5.)q I. Proposals for Air Disarmament,^&apos; in the form of a draft Despatch,including the abolition of all military and naval aircraft,combined with a strict inter-national control of civilaviation, prepared in accord-ance with the Cabinet decisionreferred to in the margin:II, A Memorandum by the Foreign Officecontaining proposals for hasteningthe work of the General DisarmamentConference:III. A suggested draft Convention forthe abolition of military aircraft and the internationalisation ofcivil aviation.A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (C.P.-176 (32))covering a Memorandum by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staffcommenting on the proposals in cp,-164 (32) and reaching theconclusion that &quot;Provided HisMajesty&apos;s Government adhere toa policy of non-interferenceoutside the Empire, combined withfreedom of movement within it.   inorder to police our commitments,we have nothing to lose and possiblymuch to gain by the adoption ofthese proposals.&quot;A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (C.P.-18S (32)),containing remarks on CP ,-164(32) in respect of Enclosuresi and II,A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Air (CP,-181 (32))containing comments on C,P,-164(32) criticising strongly theproposals for Air disarmamentcontained therein, and submittingalternative proposals,
In the absence of the Prime Minister and of theChancellor of the Exchequer the disextssion at theCabinet was of a preliminary character, mainly onthe question of procedure, and the merits of theproposals contained in the Papers referred to above were hardly mentioned.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairspressed, the urgency of a decision not only fromthe point of view of the Disarmament Conference atGeneva but also owing to the probability that thenew French Government would approach us at an earlydate on the subject of the Lausanne Conference, inwhich case it would be important to be in a positionto tell them of any proposals we might have to make on the subject of Disarmament.The Secretary of,.State for Dominion affairs pointed out that this was a question on which theDominions were likely to have a strong view, moreparticularly from the point of view &quot;of possible -international control of civil aviation.    It was by no means unlikely that the Cabinet might be influenced in their own decision by the views ofthe Dominions .   He suggested, therefore, that itmight be desirable, apart from the question of urgency as stressed by the Foreign Secretary, even before the Cabinet formed its own opinion, toascertain the views of the Dominions.   This could best be accomplished by sending the DominionGovernments particulars of the proposals beforethe Cabinet and inviting them to give instructions on the subject to their representatives in London,who might be invited to a Conference early next week.
Notwithstanding the inconvenience of having todiscuss the question with the Dominions without being able to give them any idea of the Cabinet&apos;sown impressions, the above proposal commended itselfto the Cabinet ,The suggestion was made that it was desirable,before taking the final decision, to discuss thematter not only with the Dominions but also withContinental Powers .    In this connection the cabinet were reminded of the deplorable effect which thepublication of this proposal at Geneva was likelyto have on the moral of the Royal Air Force, - an effect which might last long after the DisarmamentConference and might militate against the efficiency of that Service.    It was not worth while to runthese risks unless we had been able to assureourselves that there was a reasonable chance of theproposal being adopted, and more particularly that france and Italy were in agreement.In the above connection the Cabinet were reminded that any communication to France and Italy was almost certain to leak out.    Experience had shown,however, that the Dominions could be consultedwithout- any risk of leakage, particularly if theimportance of secrecy was impressed upon them.In the first instance, therefore,, it was felt to bedesirable to consult the Dominions, leaving thequestion of consultation with France and Italyuntil the Cabinet had formed its own views on theseproposals .Without taking any decision on the various proposals that were before them, the cabinet agreed  
(a) That, a Secret telegram should besent to the Prime Ministers ofthe Dominions, communicating tothem, in a non-committal formbut without overlooking thelarge world issues which lay-   behind it, the proposal forAir Disarmament set forth inEnclosure I to 0.P.-164 (32).It should be made clear thatthe Cabinet had not themselvesyet decided on their own attitude.The great importance of secrecyshould be enjoined, for the reasons give above.   The Prime ministers of the Dominions should be invitedto instruct their representatives in London as to their views, inorder that the subject might bediscussed at a Conference onMonday, June 6th.(NOTE: The Cabinet were givento understand thatcommunications of this nature were not at the. present time being sentto the IrivSh Free state.)(b) That the telegram should be submitted for the concurrence of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs, the Secretary of Statefor Air, and, finally, of the lord president of the Council:(c) That the Lord President of theCouncil should suggest to thePrime Minister that a special meeting   of the Cabinet for thediscussion of this question should be held on the afternoonor evening of Tuesday, June 7th,
5.    The Cabinet had before them the Third Reportof the Cabinet Committee on Trade with Russia,(Paper No. CP. 169 (^2)).In the absence.of the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer, the discussion was ofa preliminary character.The Lord President of the Council read an opinion communicated by the Prime Minister by telephone,expressing some apprehensions at the recommendations contained in the Report,      It was explained thatthe  rime Minister had not yet had an opportunity to read the whole Report, and that his opinion was formed from the Summary of Conclusions only.The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that a remarkable change had recently taken place in our trade with Soviet Russia, andthat for the first time we had a favourable trade balance.      It was pointed out that this was a new factor, since the report given to the Cabinet committee by the Board of Trade had indicated a contrarystate of affairs.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone consideration ofthe Cabinet Committee?s Reportuntil their next regular weekly meeting, when the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer,it was hoped, would be present;(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should circulate, with suchcommentary as he.might deem&apos;appropriate,  the figures for ttadewith Russia, .
IRISH?.B STATS.previous reference:Cabinet 2802), Con-elusion 5) *p-r;6.    The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that he now gathered that theIrish Free State Senate, instead of rejecting the oath Bill, was likely to insert an amendment toprevent it from becoming operative until after agreementbetween the two Governments.     He also said thatthere had been unexpected delays in the reply of theIrish Free State Government on the question of LandAnnui ties.
TIONALITYMARRIEDOMEN.reviouseferenee:babinet 932), Con-conclusion 10.)J.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.-162 (32)) on the subjectof the Nationality of Married Women.    It was necessary,he pointed out, to arrive at a decision on this vexedquestion, as the League of Nations had addressed a request to its members that, the Governments should furnish, before July 1, 1932, such observations asthey desire to present on the general question ofthe nationality of women, including their viewsregarding the Nationality Convention known as theHague Convention.After a detailed examination of the question theHome Secretary stated that as a possible means of meeting the situation he had been examining the praticability of drafting a Bill in two parts, thefirst giving effect to the Hague proposals, thesecond enabling British women not to forfeit their rights under our own domestic law by marriage to aforeigner.   Women in such circumstances would retain their rights of citizenship, and would not be treatedas aliens for the purpose of the suffrage or for thepurposes of registration under the Aliens Act.   Asregards the latter, it would be possible to securethe exemption by administrative action, but it would no doubt be more satisfactory that it should be conferred by Statute, and not left to the discretion of a Minister.   Women would not, however, be able to claim British protection if residing in their husbands&apos; country or elsewhere abroad.The Home Secretary suggested that if the Cabinetsaw no prima facie objection, the above proposal should be further examined in consultation withlegal advisers.
The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Home Secretary, and invited him to report the results of hisfurther investigations and consultation with the Law Officers.-15-
8.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Financial Secretary to the Treasury (C.P.-175(32)), covering a draft Public Works Loans bill and asking for the authority of the Cabinet tointroduce the Bill immediately.The Cabinet approved theintroduction of the Bill.
WATERLOO 9.    The Lord President of the CouncilBRIDGE.informed the Cabinet that, as the result of(previous the meeting on the previous evening of the reference:Cabinet 29 Cabinet Committee appointed at the Meeting(52), Con-clusion 5). referred to in the margin,  it had beendecided not to put on the Government Whips inthe case of the Waterloo Bridge Bill.
MALTA-.Cons ti tut ionill.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(-32), Con-clusion 1).PR.33^31.0.    The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that during the meeting he had received from the Governor of Maltaa telegram containing the substance of LordStrickland&apos;s apology to the Archbishop, and stating that the Pope had accepted the apology,and that the Archbishop intended to issue anew Pastoral withdrawing the Pastoral of May 1st,193O.     The Archbishop hoped to be in a positionto do this on June Jrd.      If that happened therewould be a complete withdrawal of the Archbishop^announcements which had rendered a genuineelection impossible.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should not makethe announcement the same afternoon that had been agreedto at the meeting referred toin the margin;(b) That the Governor should notfix the date of the electionsuntil it was known whether thenew Pastoral was satisfactory;(c) That in the latter event theSecretary of State for theColonies should make arrange-ments with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury tointroduce such legislation as might be necessary.
11. The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that he had received a telegram from theHigh Commissioner of Palestine, reporting that Mr.French, who had made to the Palestine Government thetwo Reports recently discussed at the Cabinet, had informed him that, about May 8th, he had shown bothhis reports to a journalist who represents the new york Times in the Near East.      The journalist inquestion had told Mr. French that he was not able tounderstand technicalities, and had asked him to writea clear summary, which he had done,  on the understandingthat the journalist would publish it in London or new York.On 11th May the Governor had held a Conferenceat which Mr. French had&apos; been present, in the course ofwhich he had made it quite clear that the Government,for the time being, was keeping the contents of thetwo reports strictly confidential.     Nevertheless-Mr. French had only just given him the above information.The High Commissioner,&apos;, at Mr. French&apos;s suggestion,now proposed that the Secretary of State for theColonies should put pressure on the New York Times,through its London office, not to publish the summary.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for theColonies to take such action as waspossible to carry out the HighCommissioner^ suggestion, and theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs promised the co-operation ofofficers of the Foreign Officepress department.
INDIA.Situation in.(previous reference:Cabinet 88(32), Oon-clusion 12.)FR.12.    The Cabinet took note of Weekly Reports byLocal Governments on the Folitical Situation inIndia, circulated for the information of his colleaguesby the Secretary of State for India (CP.-167 (32),and C .P.-171 (32)).
ADEN. 13.  The Cabinet took note of paraphrases ofDisturbances at..    telegrams from the Resident at Aden, circulated bythe Secretary of State for India (C.P.-178 (33))(previous reference: containing reports of recent disturbances in that cabinet 42(38), Con- Dependency,elusion 2.)-i9-
NATIONALPOWER ANDTRANSPORTRailwayPoolingAgreement-(previous reference:Cabinet 27(32), Con-cbus ion 7.)if.

fohn SIMON,- Within the last few days conversations have takenplace between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of theUnited States on the suggestion that an International EconomicConference should be called tooconsider methods to stabiliseworld commodity prices.      The matter has not advanced beyond anIinformal and entirely preliminary stage - so much so that theopportunity of consulting the other Governments chiefly concernedhas not yet arisen.      It has to be remembered that the terms ofreference for the Conference at Lausanne include among the ob-jects to be sought not only a settlement of reparations but agree-ment on financial difficulties which are responsible for, and mayprolong, the present world crisis.      Unless, therefore, the UnitedStates send representatives to the second part of the lausanne conference there is a danger of overlapping, and questions oftime and place would remain to be considered, even if a yetfurther Conference were decided on.     At the same time, the im-portance of United States co-operation in such a discussion is so great that His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government are losing no time in consult-Ing the other Governments who will be assembled at Lausanne as tothe suggestion which has been made.APPENDIX.private Notice. for Wednesday. 1st June, 195 2.MR. LANSBURY,-   To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairswhether he can state what is the present position inregard to the International Economic Conference which,according to the press, is favoured by the Governmentof the United States of America.
