ORT DUTIESoposed^reference tolalestine.[previous[Reference:[Cabinet 19(32), Con-[elusion 5.;f.R.1. The Secretary of State for the colonies reported that some decision on the proposed Prefer-ence to Palestine was urgent as the matter was liable to be raised in Debate the same day.   fierecalled the previous history of the question asset forth in the Cabinet Minute referred to in the margin, and more particularly the suggestion that,instead of granting a Preference now, it might bewell to approach the foreign countries principally concerned, and,  in the event of any country object-ing, to take the matter by agreement to The Hague court for Judgment,   He reported that the CabinetCommittee had been favourably inclined towards thisproposal, but had given earnest consideration tothe question of whether action of this kind in regardto Palestine might not act almost as an invitation to foreign countries to take to The Hague Tribunaltariff questions generally, and thus react on thepolicy of Imperial Preference.In the course of the discussion the Cabinet were reminded of the attitude taken up by the Dominionsat the League of Nations in claiming the right to betreated in all respects as independent States .This was always liable to promote criticism atGeneva, and if Preference agreements were reached at Ottawa there was the possibility that foreign nations would claim that the Dominions were trying to obtain the advantages of two contradictorypositions:    that is to say, of independence atthe League of Nations, and of preferential tradeadvantages as members of the British Commonwealth.The question before the Cabinet, therefore, was asto which course was open to the least objection.
Would it be better to proceed at once to the questionof Preference to Palestine by approaching the foreign nations concerned on the lines proposed, or, alter-natively, to await the Ottawa Conference, whichmight result in the raising by foreign nations ofthe larger issue of the bearing of Imperial Prefer-ence on most-favoured-nation treatment.The Cabinet were reminded that the question ofa Preference to Palestine would in any event not come before ^he Hague Court until some time afterthe Ottawa Conference.&apos; First, the question wouldhave to be put to the foreign countries concerned,as to whether they have any objection to a preference to Palestine.    It would only be in the event of suchobjection that the question would be referred toThe Hague Court at all, and the procedure proposed would take some time.It was felt also that the objections of foreign nations to the Dominion Preferences that might emerge from the Ottawa Conference were on rather a different footing to the question of a Preference to Palestine,the objection to which v/ould be due to its Mandatorystatus.On the question of what should be said in parliamentary Debate there was general agreement that the less said the better.    If an announcementwere to be madje that if differences of opinion aroseinternationally the question would be taken to TheHague, the negotiations with foreign countries wouldbe prejudiced.   The proper course, therefore, inParliament was to play for time.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed  
(a) To approve the proposal of theCabinet Committee that the foreigncountries principally concerned should be informed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdompropose to give a Preference to imports of produce from Palestine;.to explain that they desired toproceed with propriety and wouldlike to know if the countries concerned felt any objection.    Ifobjections were taken, subject to afresh, decision by the Cabinet theproposal might be made to take thequestion by agreement to The HagueTribunal for a decision as to whetherthe Preference proposed would be an infringement of most-favoured-nation treatment.   An alternative course that would be open to the Cabinet  particularly if a nation was torefuse to go to The Hague on an agreed case and replied that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were actingat their risk in imposing thePreference   would be to raisethe question at the mandates commission, and, on their Report,to suggest to the Council of theLeague that a decision should beobtained from The Hague Court:(b) That the United States of Americashould be added to the countries tobe consulted, viz., Spain, Italy,Brazil and Prance:(c) That the Financial Secretary to theTreasury should be asked to state,if the matter were raised in debate in Parliament the same afternoon,that very difficult legal and othercomplications were involved and thatthe whole question was being con-sidered carefully in all aspects.(NOTE: Later in the Meeting, after the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury had been summoned to attend the Cabinet, theSecretary of State for the Colonies,  inthe presence of his colleagues,informed him of the above decision.)-S-

The Secretary of State for War said that theFrench and German Delegates had met during theprevious week and had agreed not to raise theirfundamental differences until after the french general Election.    After the Bureau had discussed the situation the eventual result had been the postponement of these questions for a week or two,during which the various Commissions would bereporting on Qualitative Disarmament.

J.    The Cabinet had. before them the following  documents relating to Trade with russia Note by the&apos;President of theBoard of Trade (CP.  IJk- (^2)),which had been before the cabinet at the previous Meeting,  circulating a Memorandum by the Department of overseas Trade covering a Report bythe Export Credits guarantee department&apos;s Advisory Committee,in which authority was asked to request the Advisory Committee toproceed on the lines which theyhave suggested:A Second Report (CP.  14-1  (j52)) bythe Cabinet Committee on Trade withRussia (Appendix).In view of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s opinionthat the question of the policy of further creditswas not inseparably interlocked with the questionof the Commercial Agreement, (which is to form thesubject of a later Report by the Cabinet Committee),the Cabinet confined their discussion to the questionof Credits.No objection was raised during the discussion to the recommendation by the Export Credits GuaranteeDepartments Advisory Committee in favour of the rejection as wholly inadequate of the only proposalsfor security which the Soviet trade representative had made.The discussion at the Cabinet was almost wholly confined&apos; to the point on which the CabinetCommittee had not been able to reach agreement, whichmay be stated as follows:-The President of the Board of Trade&apos;s recommendation;-That he should be authorised to request the Advisory Committee to proceed onthe lines suggested in their Report,namely,  that during the next six monthsthey should be free to guarantee creditsfor  k- million, of which not more than 1,600,000- is to be of a duration ofmore than 12 months, provided also thatno credit should exceed 13 months from
the shipment of the goods.   . As the guaranteed Russian bills falling dueduring the next six months amount to 1?600,000,  this proposal wouldinvolve only  2, 00,000 of additionalcredit, and since the Department&apos;sliability in no case exceeds 75$ ofthe face value figure,  the contemplatedincrease of Government liability willnot be more than  1,800,000.3!tie Treasury&apos;s compromise proposal.That the previous proposals- for obtainingsecurity for bills of over 12 months should not be pressed and that the credits which fall due during the next six months, amounting to about 1,600,000, should- be replaced byfresh bills up to 13 months, on theunderstanding that the duration of the bills should be shortened so far aspossible.The president of the Board of Trade openedthe discussion by suggesting that for the immediatepresent the Overseas Trade Department should beauthorised to take action within the limits of theTreasury proposal, but that he himself should beleft free to bring before the Cabinet his widerproposals as soon as the Chancellor of the Exchequer,(absent through indisposition),  could be present ata meeting of the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for War hoped that. the Cabinet would not agree to either of theseproposals.      Although he himself felt strong objection on moral grounds to trading with whatwas virtually a slave State, he did not urge the objection on these grounds, but for financial reasons.At the present time our guarantees of trade toRussia amounted to  12 million.      Qne day we might wish to end the Trade Agreement.      The Russian
Soviet, whose honesty was admittedly doubtful, wouldstop paying the moment it became inconvenient,   thatis to say, as soon as the Trade Agreement was given up.Consequently the smaller the sums at stake the lesswould be our loss.      He also had another objection.Supposing he was in a position to inform the Cabinetthat Russia in 1933 intended to make war against us,and was in fact arming against us;    but that ourarmament firms were in urgent need of work and had askedfor permission to accept orders and make deliveries to Soviet Russia,3    notwithstanding that Russia mightobtain her requirements elsewhere, he felt certainthat in such circumstances the Cabinet would refuse to sanction the orders.  &apos;   The present position, however,was comparable with that situation.      There was abundantevidence that one of the main objects of the RussianFive-Year Plan was to smash our trade.      In creatingnew factories the Russians were seeking to damage our industry.      By giving the credits that were nowproposed we should be helping Russia to equip herfactories at our expense (since we should,  in all-probability, never recover the whole cost), notwithstand-ing that her intention was to damage us as much aspossible.      He recalled the great effect which the critics of the Government had made on the House ofLords in the -Debate during the previous week.In the course of the discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Export Credits Department hadaccumulated from the premiums&apos; paid by manufacturerson Russian trade a substantial surplus,     which was available as a sum to set off possible future losses.Up to the present time there had been no default by russia.      In a business balance sheet, however,  the
Russian Soviet bills would probably be valued at-i33&quot;^ discount.        Some stress was laid on the importanceof the large orders that might be obtained by the machine tool industry, by the adoption of the Presidentof the Board of Trade&apos;s proposals,  and attention was called to a Memorandum by the Secretary of the cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence, attached as appendix I to the Report of the Cabinet Committee,showing the importance of the machine tool industry from the point of view of industrial mobilisation.      Inthis connection a latter was read from Sir Alfred Herbert,the President of the Machine Tools Association.The suggestion was made that the Cabinet should obtain information from the British Embassy in Moscow,or other competent authority, as to how far the five-year plan was likely to be carried out;    how far the machine tools they wished to order were likely to be used forcompetition with us, or merely for purposes of internalrequirements.In this connection the President of the Boardof Trade informed the Cabinet that the five-Year plan was likely to require some extension of time, although no change had been made in the policy underlying the Plan.The Cabinet were informed that if the credit facilities now contemplated were not offered, SovietRussia could and would obtain her requirements elsewhere.Information was received during the meeting to the effectthat an  80,000 order to a British firm had been givento Krupps, owing to the fact that the extended credit facilities were not made available, but the Cabinet were reminded that on previous occasions when correspondingcases were under consideration, Cabinets had been
confronted with similar allegations which hadnot always proved true.Reference was made to the efforts made by morethan one Government to get in touch with the GermanGovernment with a view to avoidance of one countrybeing &quot;played off&quot; against the other.     Such negotiations had never led to successful results,The Secretary of State for India, who haddevoted much attention to the study of the Russiansituation, did not take an alarmist view of the Five-YearsPlan, which he believed had not made very much progress.The history of Russia showed how rarely their planscame to fruition^      He was not nervous that machine tools purchased now would become a danger to thiscountry, and it was more likely that they would beruined through mishandling,     He thought,  therefore,that the question should be dealt with solely as a financial issue.The Cabinet were reminded that the objections raised against the supply of machinery to Russia hadbeen urged against its supply to other countries, e,g.,looms to Japan.      The United States of America hadequipped this country with a good deal of machinerythat could be used in competition with themselves.      Itwas suggested that the inefficiency of the Slav was ourgreatest protection from this point of view.The Cabinet were reminded, however,  that ifcredit   were extended to one type of business we shouldbe pressed very hard to extend it to other classes.There was evidence from the Banks that later in the yearRussia might be unable to continue payments.      In that event this country would be faced with a flood of cheapRussian goods of every kind.      It was urged,  therefore,that the one essential point was. to assure our liberty
of action in that event.      If the present creditproposals were approved, therefore, it should be onthe understanding that the Government was neverthelessabsolutely free to denounce the Trade Agreement ifthey so desire.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the President of the Boardof Trade should be authorised toaTTTow the/Overseas Tracl^ Depart-ment to take action for thepresent within the limits ofthe Treasury proposal, as set forth in paragraph 10 of the CabinetCommittee&apos;s Report:-&quot;On the other hand, in view ofthe admitted risks of thesecredits, the Treasury considerthat from the merely financialpoint of view,  it would bedesirable to reduce them,but that from the point of viewof giving employment, it wouldbe a reasonable compromise.tomaintain the credits at theirexisting volume.      The treasury would be willing, therefore,to agree that the previousproposals for obtaining security for bills of over 12 months should not be pressed, and thatthe credits which fall dueduring the next 6 months amountingto about  1,600,000 should bereplaced by fresh bills up to.18 months, on the understandingthat the duration of the bills should be shortened so far aspossible&quot;.    (CP. 14-1  (32), para.10).But that this decision should besubject to the following:-(b) That the Financial Secretary to theTreasury should ascertain that theChancellor of the Exchequer approves(a) and that action thereon shouldnot be taken until his approvalhas been received, and that if theChancellor of the Exchequer feelsany objection he must have anopportunity of stating it to theCabinet before the decision isacted upon;(c) That the President of the Board ofTrade has the right to reopen at -the Cabinet the larger proposals set forth in his Note,  (CP. 134- (32));
(d) That the decision recorded in (a)is entirely without prejudice tothe decision to be taken later bythe Cabinet on the question ofthe future of the Russian trade agreement.NOTE;- The Secretary of State forWar asked the Lord Presidentof the Council to ascertain whether, as a special case,the Prime Minister would allow him to record hisdissent from Conclusion (a).

9 . The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister of Transport (C.P.-143 (32)) reporting a judgment on April 21, 19 32, in the King&apos;s bench division, which was&apos; binding, with no appeal to any higher Court, the effect of which would be to renderall the lighter types of private cars,  if usedoccasionally for the conveyance of luggage or goods of some kind, liable to the rate of Duty applicableto the lighter types of goods vehicles, i.e,,  10, 15 or  20, according to the unladen weight. ThisJudgment was contrary to the view of the legal advisers of the Ministry, and created a position that could not be allowed to continue.    The Ministerof transport stated that he was consulting with theChancellor of the Exchequer as to steps which mightbe taken by means of a suitable Clause in theFinance Bill to make clear the point beyond any possibility of doubt, and that in the meantime hehad caused, a circular to be sent to the licensing authorities requesting them to maintain their exist-ing practice pending further consideration of thematter.The Cabinet took note of the above.

The Home Secretary suggested that theCabinet ought to!have in mind theConstitutional effect of the proposal now beforeParliament that the Free List in the Import DutiesAct may be modified, after six months, by Orderon the advice of the Import Duties Committee.   he did not wish to discuss the question in the absenceof the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the.Exchequer, but he felt it ought to be mentionedin case it should afterwards be said that it had never been raised.   He was under the impression that there had been no Cabinet decision on thispoint, though he realised that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had, at an earlier stage, given a pledge to deal with it.The President of the Board of Educationassociated himself with the Home Secretary inthis question.3, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 27,  1932,

3. With regard to (b) . the Cabinet at their meeting on 20th April last (Cabinet 24 (32)Conclusion l) had before them a Not e (CP.. 134 (.32))by the President of the Board 5f Trade covering aMemorandum by the. Secretary t.0 the Department of overseas Trade to which was attached a Report bythe Export Credits Guarantee Departments AdvisoryCommittee.        In this Report the Advisory Committeein effect recommended the rejection as whollyInadequate of the only proposals for security whichthe Soviet Trade Representative has made and submitted a new scheme for credits to be grantedduring the next six months pending a final decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government as to their policy inregard to the general question of trade with Russia.4. The Cabinet deferred consideration of these documents pending a Report from this CabinetCommittee.5. At the Meeting cf the Cabinet on the 20thApril the question was raised whether the policy inregard to further credits is so bound up with thequestion of the Commercial Agreement that they couldnot in fact be separately dealt with and settled.We have carefully examined this question and are all agreed that the two issues are not so Inseparablyinterlocked as to render necessary the postponement of a decision on the question of. credits until one can be taken on the Commercial Agreement.
6. Determination of the -Commercial agreement and restriction of imports from Russia giverise to a number of questions, e.g., the cashvalue of the Fisheries Agreement, the legal posi-tion at the Soviet Trade Delegation in Londonsand the probable financial and commercial effects of restricting imports from Russia into theUnited Kingdom, which are under urgent examination by the Departments concerned and will form thesubject of a further Report to the Cabinet in thenear future,,7* The President **f the Board of Traderecommends that he should be authorised to request the Advisory Committee to proceed on the lines suggested in their Report, namely:-   that, duringthe next six months they should be free to guarantee credits for  4 yftOO.000. of which notmore than  1,600.0^0 is to bo of a. duration ofmore than 12 months, provided also that no creditshould exceed 18 months from the shipment of the government ft As.       As the guaranteed Russian bills falling*ue during the next six months amount to  1,600,000
this proposal would involve only  2,400,000 ofadditional credit and since the Department&apos;sliability in no .case exceeds 75% of the face valuefigure, the contemplated increase.of Governmentliability will not be more than  1,-500.000.8. For the foregoing temporary arrangements the Advisory Committee would not propose to make the deposit of security an indispencible conditionprovided that the instalments were spread to. theirsatisfaction.      But in order to build up adequate reserves against the risk of default by Russiathey would continue to fix such rates of premium,as they deem to be appropriate.9. Apart from the considerable employmentthat the adoption of the Advisory Committee&apos; p,proposals will provide in certain depressed Indus-tries and in particular in the Machine ToolIndustry, the efficiency and stability of this industry are very important from the point of view ofImperial Defence;  (see Memorandum by theSecretary to the Cabinet -     Annex I ), while,,moreover, If Russia now turns to Germahy to supplyher machine tool requirements, the present openingIn the Russian market may be permanently lost.
10.   . On the other hand, in view of the admitted risks of these credits, the Treasury consider that from the merelyfinancial point of view, ft would &quot;be desirable to reduce thenn,but that from the point of view of giving employment, it -wouldbe a reasonable compromise to maintain the credits at theirexisting volume0     The Treasury would be willings therefore,to agree that the previous proposals for obtaining security forbills of over 12 months should not be pressed, and that the credits which fall due during the next 6 months amounting toabout  1^600,000 should be replaces! by fresh bills up to 18months, on the understanding that the duration of the bills should be shortened so far as possible.-11. It was pointed out that in effect this constituted a new proposal, as the Cabinet, had left to the discretion ofthe Export Credits Advisory Committee the amount of credits tobe guaranteed at 12 months or less and had only asked theCommittee to report to them about credits of more than 12 months,and further that the probable result would be that orders mightbe placed in the near future at 18 months for the full amountnow proposed, and that subsequent orders at 12 months or less  -would, therefore, have to be refused.12. &quot;Wo have been unable to r^ach agreement on theproposals contained In CP.  134   (32) and accordingly submit the matter for decision by the Cabinet.13. we are, however, unanimously of opinion that a decisionon this matter at the earliest possible moment is most desirable.14* We have been informed&quot;&apos;&apos; that the negotiations betweenthe Scottish Herring Industry        the Russian PurchasingOrganisations are likely, in the course of the next week or4-     - -Annex   II.

(This Document Is the Property o* Fis BritanniaMajesty&apos;s Government .)fi^E 0 R E T -COPY N0-TRADE Wr?H RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary to theCabinet.At the Meeting of the Cabinet held on May 18th,during the discussion of the question of Trade with soviet Russia the Prime Minister referred to theinterest of the Committee of Imperial. Defence in thequestion of machine tools.    There has not teen time toobtain formal Reports from, the Sub-Committees concerned,but it is thought the following information may be ofinterest to the Cabinet.2. The Committee of &quot;Imperial Defence is concernedin the question before the Cabinet from two separatepoints of view, namely:-( i)&apos; The importance of the machine toolindustry from, the point of view ofBritish industrial mobilisation intime of war, which is under examina-tion by the Principal Supply OfficersSub-C omm.it t e e:(ii) The great efforts that have been madein Soviet Russia, to create a schemeof industrial mobilisation, for whichmachine tools are essential.3. Dealing first with the former point, duringthe late War,  one,  if not the principal, underlyingcauses of delay in the production of,munitions vas the
fact that the necessary machine tools did not exist in this country and had to be obtained either byimportation from the United States of America ormanufacture in this country.    The Principal supply officers Committee,  in considering the needs ofindustrial mobilisation,has given considerable attention to this subject,  and a Technical Sub-Committee has been set up under the Chairmanship ofSir Gilbert Vyle.4. At this stage it is sufficient to mention that the Sub-Committee feels deep concern at theextent to which British industry depends upon foreignsources of supply for many types of machine toolsrequired in time of war.    Although I have not beenable to consult, the Sub-Committee or its Chairman,.!have no hesitation, from my knowledge of its proceed-ings,  in saying that anything which helps the machine tool industry is important from the point of view ofImperial Defence.5. Turning to the second aspect, the Committeeof Imperial Defence has a special Sub-Committee whichis dealing with industrial mobilisation in foreigncountries and is  co-ordinating the work of the various departments .    A good deal of information has driftedin during the last- few yea-rs to show that Soviet Russia,like all the larger nations, including ourselves,  ispreparing a scheme for the war mobilisation of industry,and there is much evidence to show that it is part ofthe development of the Five Years Plan.    There is evidence also that the provision of machine tools isone of the limiting factors, and that they have been making cautious enquiries both in Germany and in thiscountry with a view to assisting them in overcoming theproblem .
fact that the necessary machine tools, did not exist in this country and had to be obtained either byimportation from the United States of America ormanufacture in this country.    The Principal supply officers Committee,  in considering the needs ofindustrial mobilisation,has given considerable attention to this subject, and a Technical Sub-Committee has been set up under the Chairmanship ofSir Gilbert Vyle.4. At this stage it is sufficient to mention that the Sub-Committee feels  deep concern at theextent to which British industry depends upon foreignsources of supply for many types of machine toolsrequired in time of war.    Although I have not beenable to consult the Sub-Committee or its Chairman,  Ihave no hesitation, from my knowledge of its proceedsings,  in saying that anything which helps the machine tool industry is important from the point of view ofImperial Defence.5. Turning to the second aspect,  the Committeeof Imperial Defence has a special Sub-Committee whichis dealing with industrial mobilisation in foreigncountries and is  co-ordinating the work of the various departments.    A good deal of information has driftedin during the last few years to show that Soviet Russia,like all the larger nations, including ourselves,  ispreparing a acheme for thewar mobilisation of industry,and there ,is much evidence to show that it is part ofthe development of the Five&apos;Years Plan.    There is evidence also that the provision of machine tools isone of the limiting factors, and that they have been making cautious enquiries both in Germany and in thiscountry with a view to assisting them in overcoming theproblem .
6. Attention is invited to the fact that outof a total of  7,000,000 worth of orders placed with british firms by Arcos in 1931,  over  3,000,000represents orders for machine tools and cognatearticles . - A list of firms and the value of the orders placed with them, by Arcos is attached in the Enclosure.Additional orders for such machinery as can be usedfor munition-making,  e ,g., presses, cranes, etc.,have not been included in this list.7. Prom this point of view the argument atfirst sight, so far as the Committee of ImperialDefence is concerned, would seem to be in favour of notgiving facilities to-Russia for the purchase of machine tools.    On the other hand, the argument which alwaysarises when questions of the supply of war material to foreign countries comes up, applies in this casealso, namely, that- if they do not obtain their requirements in this country they will x^lace their orders elsewhere, to the benefit of rival industrialnations .(Signed) M.P.A.HANKEY,Secretary to the Cabinet.S, Whitehall G-gardens , S .W.1,April 25,  19 32.

ANNEX II.SECRET.T.R. (52)  7.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON TRADE WITH RUSSIA.PURCHASE OF BRITISH HERRINGS BY RUSSIA.Memorandum Toy the Secretary of the Department of overseas Trade.The Secretary of State for Scotland Informs methat the negotiations which have been taking place betweenthe Scottish herring industry and the Russian purchasingorganisations are likely in the course ^f the next week or tws*to reach a stage at which some further reminder from HiesMajesty&apos;s Government of the desirability of a substantialpurchase of British herrings Is advisable in the interestsof the balance of trade between this country and Russia.2. The Foreign Office feel that any such reminderwould be mnre effective if given by the President of theBoard of Trade, or by myself, ten the Soviet TradeRepresentative than if it were given by the foreign secretary to the Soviet-.Ambassador, wh* might very likelyplead ignorance of the negotiations.3. It would, I think, be undesirable to approach theSoviet Trade Representative until the question of theconditions on which future credits should be given has been settled, but if the Committee approve, I suggest that-when-that point has been reached, either the President of the Board ofTrade&apos;or I should speak to Monsieur Ozersky in the sensedesired-by the-Secre^tary-of State for Scotland.(Intd.)
