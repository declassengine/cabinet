9 9 9:%JDISARMAMENT .General Policyand Air PolicypreviousReference:Cabinet 30(38), Con-clusion 4.)1. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Disarmament Policy:-Memoranda which had been beforethem at their previous Meeting,referred to in the margin, viz.:-By the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (C.P.-164 (32)):By the Secretary of State forWar (C.P.-176 (32)):By the Secretary of State forAir fC.P.-181 (32));By the First Lord of the Admiralty(C.P.-182 (32));together with the following fresh *material:-A Note by the Secretary of Statefor Air &apos; CP.-183 ( 32)) covering a Memorandum by the Chief of theAir Staff on the Defence Aspectsof the proposals in CP.-164 (32);A copy of a telegram sent on june 1st. by&apos;direction of the Cabinet,to the Prime Ministers of Canada,Australia, New Zealand and SoiithAfrica ( CP.-185 (32)) ;Copies of the replies from theDominions (CP.-194 (32)):Notes of a Meeting between theCabinet Ministerial Committeeon Disarmament and Representativesof the Dominions and India, heldon the previous day (CP.-193 (32)).The Cabinet were informed that on the questionsunder consideration the Dominions were generallyprepared to support any policy that they might decide to adopt .In the absence of the Secretary of State forWar, his remarks to the representatives of theDominions, as recorded in CP.-192 (32), pp.24-26,were read to the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for India read a telegramhe had received the same afternoon from the viceroy of India,  definitely opposing the proposal for thetotal abolition of military aircraft and the
imposition of international control over civilaviation (Appendix I) ,    This telegram had beensent in reply to a telegram from the Secretary ofState forwarding, without comment, the telegram,that had been sent to the Dominions.The principal objections urged against the above proposals for Air Disarmament may be summed up asfollows:--   (l) As shown in the Government of India&apos;telegram and other Papers before theCabinet, we should incur very serious.disadvantages if aircraft could not beused for the control of tribesmen onthe Worth-West Frontier of India, inIraq and various parts of the Empire.Return to the costly and uns at is fa c tori-military campaigns of pre-war dayscould not be contemplated withoutmisgiving.   This disadvantage would be mitigated if the use of air forces was permitted for police purposes.   This,however, would leave a loophole forevasion.    Prance would, claim a similarprivilege, and French aircraft in north Africa could be used to reinforceFrance in case of war.   Further,  itwould be difficult to induce nations that had no oversea possessions to agreeto exception for police purposes beingmade to the colonial Powers, since this would, give the latter an advantage in the event of war,(2) The impracticability of the proposalsfor international control of civilaviation, and more particularly ofthe smaller types of aeroplanes.The Lord Presidents original suggestion for limiting Government subsidies(possibly by the adoption of somelicensing system) was, it was suggested,more worthy of further exploration.This proposal, however, was alsocriticised on the ground that it wouldhamper civil aviation, though it was recognised that development of aviationwithout subsidies might be more healthy.It was pointed out also that the varyingbasis on which the subsidies were granted by different countries would render itdifficult to co-ordinate subsidies.(3) The probability that the proposals wouldbe rejected by the Disarmament Conferenceand prove to be a mere gesture, fore-doomed to failure.(4) The adverse effect that this gesturewould exercise on the moral of theRoyal Air Force.
The Secretary of State for Air demurredaltogether to the idea of singling outone particular Service for abolition..  In support of the proposals the following considerations were urged:-(i) The danger to great cities all overEurope, including London.    In thisconnection the Home Secretary&apos;s remarks to the representatives of the dominions on the position of London were summarisedfor the Cabinet (CP.-192 (32), pp .22-24).(ii) The resulting apprehension and unrestamong the peoples of Europe.(iii) The obligation on the Government tomake a serious effort to eliminate thedanger of air attack.    If no such efforthad been made at the Disarmament Confer-ence it was suggested that there wouldbe serious reproaches when an attempt was made to educate public opinion onthe need for air raid precautions, which,the Cabinet were warned, would otherwise be necessary in the near future.(iv) The probability that, in the absence ofsome effective proposal of wide scope,the Disarmament Conference would become a tragic failure, with consequences that were recognised by the political leadersof all countries at Geneva to be fraughtwith the gravest danger.(v) The reproaches that are being, levelledat Geneva and elsewhere against the allegedfailure of the United Kingdom   theforemost exponent of disarmament   togive the Conference a decisive lead.(vi) The present proposal had been arrivedat by a process of exhaustion after allthe more important suggestions for.reducing air armaments and theirdestruetiveness (with the single exceptionof a limitation in the maximum size ofthe aeroplane) had been shown to be inadequate or impracticable,(vii) The paramount need for economy if european and national bankruptcy is to be avoided,. and the importance of sparing no effort to reduce expenditure onarmaments by international agreementbefore asking the nation to acceptfurther burdens.The question was raised, however, as to whether,if these proposals for air disarmament were put0
there would he sufficient advantages to compensate for the inevitable disadvantages, more especially as affecting the moral and future of the Royal AirForce.There was general agreement that the proposalsfor abolishing military and naval aviation, and for international supervision of civil aviation, couldnot be submitted to the Disarmament Conference beforethe attitude of at least some of the principal powers concerned had been ascertained.   Before considering how this could best be accomplished, the Cabinetgave consideration to the other proposals of theForeign Office in Enclosure II to CP.-164 (.32),page 11.Proposal (2), for a Convention restrictingarmaments until 31st December,  1936, to limits notexceeding &quot;the, average figures of, the last y years&quot;,was objected to from a naval point of view, on theground that France had been building heavily duringthe last few years, while we had been reducing?that, in addition to building, she had adopted a formidable programme of naval construction;    andthat her efforts had been directed towards theadoption of some such datum line.The proposals for a further Disarmament confer-erase in 1935 and for a &quot;political truce&quot; werecommended.Suggestions were made that, if the largermeasures of air disarmament were rejected, it mightbe worth while to fall back on an internationalprohibition of bombing, or on rules of war aa tothe legitimate objectives of bombing attacks.Such laws of war, it was urged, would tend to checkpreparations in times of peace, and nations would
often hesitate to incur odium by breaking them.    Evenif they could, not be relied on in all circumstances,they would tend to lessen public apprehension.It was suggested that the proposals we were already prepared to make were, in the aggregate,very considerable, and that (apart from the factthat we had disarmed more than any other nation)the reproach that we had not given an adequate leadwas not justifiable.    For example, the proposal to limit the maximum weight of the aeroplane would bevery effective for the future.   Our naval proposalsfor qualitative disarmament, in particular, wererecognised to be very considerable (Appendix II),It was explained that the size of the capital ship was conditioned partly by the calibre of the armament and partly by the need to provide against under-waterattack so long as the submarino wan. permitted...The calibre required for the main armament for capital ships , it waa inoiotod by the United Sta-tes-,should exceed by 4&quot; the calibre of the largestcruiser gun.    So long as the United States insisted on the 8&quot; cruiser it was impossible to reduce thegun for capital ships below IS&quot;.It was urged that some opportunity should betaken to emphasise the magnitude in the aggregate of the above proposals,The Cabinet then returned tc -the method ofsounding other nations as to their attitude towardsthe various proposals that.had been discussed, and decided:-
(a) That the Prime Minister and hiscolleagues should be authorisedto enter into private and informal conversations with M. Herriot and sign or G-randi,   They should inform them that the Cabinet had been considering various suggestions,including one for the abolition ofmilitary and naval air forces andthe international supervision of civilian aviation.    They should indicate the difficulties presented by this latter aspect, and, so faras they thought advisable,  discussthe suggested alternatives ,    Theyshould enquire what the attitudeof the French and Italian Govern-ments would be if proposals onthese general lines were made tothe Disarmament Conference;(b) That the conversations should, bewide in scope and should embracethe various proposals discussed bythe Cabinet, including the politicaland naval proposals contained in cp.-164 (32) and in this Minute:(c) That the results of these conversa-tions shoiild be reported to theCabinet, and that, if an importantdecision was required, one of the participants should return to london to discuss the question with theCabinet:(d)    That every possible precaution shouldbe taken to keep the conversationsconfidential:(e) That, in the event of the proposalsproving unacceptable to France orItaly, the question of whether to pursue them at Geneva should besubject to a decision of the Cabinet,

APPENDIX   i telegram from Viceroy dated 6th June 1932..Immediate.420r-S.      Private and personal.     Your private and personal telegram dated 4th June, 1540.You have already received our views showing theimportance ^ve attach to continued use of bombing for effective control of our tribes beyond the administrativeborder, and the possible repercussions we may expect,should we be deprived of that power.      Those views stillhold good.2*    As regards the&apos; general question, w e query the efficacy of any convention preventing a nation havingrecourse to bombing in war in the last resort, nor do weconsider that international control of civil aviation willstop nations employing their ci^il aircraft for thepurposes of reconnaissance, and even for bombing, in theevent of an emergency.      On the other hand, w e suggestthat, looking to the position of the United Kingdom ascompared with other European countries,  international control must- inevitably place us in a disadvantageousposition in respect of development and production of aircraft, and must react unfavourably on the establishmentof inter-Empire commiptnications, which would be a retrograde step.      Moreover,  international control, to be effective,would involve the maintenance of permament technicalcommissions in each country - a condition we ourselvesconsider of first importance in respect of Russia.3.    Total abolition of military aircraft is tenta-mount to putting the clock back twenty years, and would deprive land forces of a means of reconnaissance and protection from surprise, which they have a right to expect
and upon which they place reliance-      This,  in our opinion,is an unfair handicap to impose.      As far&apos; as India isconcerned,  it would also involve a revision of the strength, -composition and disposition of our land forces,  as these havebeen considerably reduced during the past decade consequent on tho a ave-.it of Royal Air Force.      It must be realised that India&apos;s neighbours, Afghanistan and the  tribes,  areuncivilised and cannot be relied upon to abide by any international convention, and that behind them is Russia,which constitutes a perpetual menace and which is even lessreliable than either of the other two.4.      International control;,  even if administrativelyfeasible 3 would presumably mean transfer of control of theIndian State air service to some international body, therebyimpinging on Indian national sentiment,  imposing restrictions and increasing cost to the Indian taxpayer.5.      In conclusion^ we are definitely opposedto the total abolition of international control over civilaviation.      In deference to Imperial needs,, we are preparedto a gree to the abolition of bombings but press strongly forthe retention of aircraft for reconnaissance and artilleryco-ope ration.
