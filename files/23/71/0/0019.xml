lo In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin,  the Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum (Paper CP.  214 (32)) by the Secretary ofState for India,  covering a draft Statement of inten-tions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to future procedure for the revision of the Indian Constitution.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA reported tothe Cabinet that since the discussion at the Meetingon June 15th (Cabinet 35 (32) Conclusion 2), he hadbeen in communication with the Prime Minister whose views were contained in a letter dated June 22nd whichwas read to the Cabinet.      For the terms of this letter5ee appendix I.      The proposed Statement in parliament had been telegraphed to the Viceroy whose suggestionshad been embodied in the draft annexed to CP. 214 (32),The Viceroy was definitely in favour of thescheme being examined by the Joint Select committee before and not after the^/Second Reading of the Bills onthe ground that this would ease the situation from theIndian point of view and would be of great assistanceto him in his efforts to secure the co-operation ofthe Indian Liberal leaders.The Parliamentary Authorities had been consulted on the question of the procedure and had advised theSecretary of State that there would be no objection tothe submission, before Second Reading, to the joint select Sommittee for consideration, of a White Paperembodying a paraphrase&quot; of the terms of the proposed bill, provided that the Bill itself was not submitted.In reply to a questions the Secretary of State saidthat he intended to set out in the White Paper theterms of the actual safeguards and not merely some general words to- the effect that safeguards would beincluded in the Bill.
The wording of the paragraph at the foot of page 3of the Draft Statement was perhaps too specific, and theSecretary of State proposed to amend it so as to indicatethat if the Indians themselves welcomed the procedure suggested, the Government would he prepared to recommendParliament to adopt it.    The Secretary of State also informed the Cabinet that he had conferred with theChancellor and the Chancellor of the Chamber of princes, both of whom were strongly opposed to anyfurther large meetings such as meetings of the RoundTable Conference or of the Federal Structure Committee.They thought that the further consultations with regardto questions affecting the States should take place withthe Viceroy in India, and that when those consultationshad resulted in a scheme, certain representatives of the princes should come to London for the conclusion of thebusiness.Some discussion took place as to the Time Tablewhich might have to be envisaged.    It was generally agreedthat the sequence of events would be somewhat as follows:(1)    Decisions by the Cabinet on the Communalquestion;(2)    Discussions in the Consultative Committeein India;(3)    Decisions by the Cabinet on outstanding questions;(4)    Preparation of a White Paper in which the schemeof the proposed Bill would be incorporated!(5)    Debates in both Houses on the Resolutions toset up the Joint Select Committee;(6) Examination of the Scheme by the Joint, Select ^ -Committee, report of Committee and/drafting r*and introduction of Bill. *Uncertainty as to the progress of the discussions with the Princes made any forecast difficult, but it was doubtful whether the White Paper could be ready muchbefore -ifcetey 1933; if so, the Debates on the Resolutionsmight take place ^*&amp;t before the Easter Recess.    TheJoint Select Committee might be expected to devote at least
sixty days to the consideration of the scheme, and itmight he anticipated that the Bill would not he ready for Ms^oduotion muoh-teejgeye-Jgmxtary. 1934.   A favourablereport by the Joint Select Committee would greatlyfacilitate the subsequent stages of the Bill? whichshould be taken on the floor of the House of Commons.Attention was drawn to the penultimate paragraphof the statement, and the Cabinet were assured that theobjections to large meetings did not apply to the consultative body to be summoned, if necessary,  toLondon as suggested in that paragraph.The suggestion was made that,  in view of the termsof the Prime Minister&apos;s concluding remarks4&quot;to the RoundTable Conference,  the Indians might challenge the procedure proposed on the ground that it involved a breach of faith.It was pointed out, however, that the pledge that hadbeen given was that the Indians should be consulted at every stage, and that this pledge was, in fact, being fully implemented,  though there had been a change in themethod of consultation originally contemplated.    time was an essential factor, and experience had shewn thatspeedy decisions could not be realised if the methodof discussion in big meetings was continued.The Cabinet were informed that the Treasury saw-no objection to the proposed announcement, for thefollowing reasons:-&quot;The financial safeguards, it will be admitted,are of absolutely vital importance not merely to thiscountry, but also ( and even primarily) to the well-being of India.    They have been referred to in previousprcnouncements with a lack of emphasis and precision which seemed to the Treasury very dangerous though it was nodoubt inevitable.    So far as I can see, this document-3-&quot;*&quot;&quot;In the end we shall have to meet again&quot;.
d   0does not water down the emphasis to a greater degreethan before,: while on the other hand it could not beexpected that this occasion would be used for increasing the emphasis.    R0V.N.H.S3o 6.1932. &quot;The Cabinet agreed :-To give general approval to theStatement in the form annexed to paper CP. 214 (32), on the under-standing that the Secretary ofState for India should be at liberty to embody in the Statement any suggestions, not involving alterations of substance, which Members of theCabinet^might think fit to make tohim.(1)(2) To take note that the Secretary ofState for India proposed to includethe Statement in the form approvedby the Cabinet in his speech in the india Office Estimates Debate inthe House of Commons on Monday,27th June, 1932.
;HE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE,GENERAL POLICYAND AIR POLICY,o d o o o(previousReferenceCabinet31 (32)Conclusion 1).2. With reference to the conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had beforethem a Memorandum (Paper CP. 222 (32)) by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs., who had returned to England for the express purpose ofreporting&apos;to the Cabinet the present position atthe Geneva and Lausanne Conferences.The Memorandum in question covered(l) a summary, initialled by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary ofState for Air and the Home Secretary of the&apos;private conversations&apos; on the subject of dis-armament which had recently been conductedbetween French, American and British represen-tatives at Geneva.      These conversations had,so far, been attended with considerable success and were being continued.      In particular,attention was drawn to the provisional agreement in respect of Air Bombing.(2) the statement of President Hoover&apos;s proposalsread to the General Commission of the Disarma-ment Conference-by Mr. Gibson on June 22nd? and(3) the substance of the Secretary of State&apos;sspeech following Mr. Gibson&apos;s statement.In the concluding paragraph of his Memorandum,the Secretary of State expressed the view that,in considering this question, three largematters should be borne in mind %-(i) the necessity of bringing to the frontour own British plan on bold and practical lines?    Britain must not lag-behind America in zeal for Disarmament.
We have in fact now assembled a better set of proposals, and a far more practical set,,But owing to the delay in getting cleardecisions^  the effect has been largely lost byproducing items piece-meal.(ii)    We must firmly maintain our stand for what isnecessary for the special purposes of theBritish Commonwealth.      I was careful to say inmy speech that it seemed to me that the HooverPlan did not allow sufficiently for the variedresponsibilities of different naval Powers.(At the same time a well-judged, all-roundreduction would be an immense relief to everybody).(iii)    The relation between Geneva and Lausanne isimmensely important.      No-one would dream ofsacrificing the necessities of British and imperial defence to any other consideration, butthe fact is that if we can shew ourselves forth-coming and sympathetic to the American proposals,we shall create a much better atmosphere for thedisoussions of American debt than if we do not.For convenience of reference the Summary of the &apos;provate conversations&apos;  is attached (see Appendix II).
iprivato-grsations1edure.The attention of the Cabinet was directed to certain telegrams which had been received by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the Secretaryof State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty,from their respective representatives at Geneva,relative to a proposal for Budgetary Limitation ofArmaments, which had been submitted to the French and american Representatives on the previous day subject tothe reservation that the British Government had not yetconsidered the proposal.     The Cabinet were reminded that this was a matter on which the Dominions wereacutely divided;    that the question itself had been thesubject of very prolonged consideration by Ministers and departments concerned,in the course of which emphasishad been laid on the great practical difficulties inthe application of any scheme of Budgetary Limitation,and in particular on the great objections from thepoint of view of the United Kingdom to any scheme which included the global limitation of land, naval and airexpenditure.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs explained to the Cabinet that these &apos;private conversations1were being conducted on the basis that no question was t*be excluded from consideration, and that all conclusions reached were to be regarded as tentative and provisional and as involving no sort of commitment.    The represent-atives of the three Powers were comparing round a table in a spirit of full co-operation their impressions,witha view ultimately to securing the largest possible commonmeasure of agreement.    It had been agreed at the outset that until the whole field had been surveyed, there could
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs informed the Cabinet that the general impression through-out the world was that Mr. Hoover had at all eventsproduced a scheme, and that Great Britain was in dangerof missing a great opportunity.     He attached thegreatest importance to the production, as soon aspossible by the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva,of a British Disarmament plan which would not be opento the obvious objections and drawbacks of the Hooverplan, but would be at one and the same time bold,be no question of formulating,much less of putting forward, definite proposals.    The Secretary of Stateadded that he had been in telephonic communication withthe Secretary of State for Air who did not takea serious view of what had occurred.In the course of subsequent discussion, theCabinet were reminded of the terms of the conclusion reached at their Meeting on April 13th 1932 (Cabinet21(32) Conclusion 3(a)) in regard to the manner inwhich this particular problem should be dealt with atGeneva, viz :-&quot;The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Conclusions of the ministerial committee (D.C.(M)(32) 2nd Conclusions(g) on pp.12 and 14) on the subject of budgetary Limitation should be amended to read as follows :-&quot;On the question of Budgetary Limit-ation the Committee agreed thatthis form of limitation presentedgreat practical difficulties inapplication.    In view, however, ofthe possible misrepresentation ofan attitude of hostility, theCommittee agreed that the UnitedKingdom Delegation should not present a blank negative, but should be given discretion as to how they deal with this matter whenthe discussions arise at Geneva.&quot;
practical and capable, if possible, of general 351application.     In this connection it must, however,be remembered that if our plan was to carry conviction,it must include a measure of naval disarmament.   Wemust, in fact, be prepared to discard from strength.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY indicated to theCabinet a Disarmament scheme which the Admiralty wereprepared to endorse and which would give genuinereductions, and not, like the Hoover Scheme, merereductions on paper.    This scheme was on the followinglinesCapital Ships.     The Hoover proposal was toreduce the number of capital ships by one-third.    From our point of view this was opento very grave objections from every aspect.The Hoover plan would give a reduction of138,100 tons.      By retaining the presentnumber of capital ships (15), but reducingthe maximum size to, say 25,000 tons and 12&quot;guns we should secure/a reduction of 117^750tons.     If we could secure an agreement to cease building 8&quot; gun cruisers, the size ofcapital ships could be further reduced andthis would give an additional 45,000 tons oran aggregate reduction of 750 tons.Aircraft Carriers.

Until the end of 1936 our cruisertonnage is subject to a maximum of -3-00,000.The Admiralty requirements are 60 cruisersunder age plus 10 over age, and if the 8&quot; guncruiser could be abolished our cruiser strength
10would be 40 cruisers of 7,000 tons and20 of 5,000 tons;    this would give an increase over the Naval Treaty allowance of41,000 tons.Submarines.    The Admiralty would welcome the all-round abolition of the submarinegiving a reduction of 52,700 tons as againstthe Hoover reduction of 17,700.Destroyers.      It might be found possible toreduce the number of destroyers if submarines were abolished;    this would give a reductionof 50,000 tons as against the Hooverreduction of 37,000.In the aggregate the Admiralty proposals (allowing for the increased cruiser tonnage)  show a total reduction of 281,000 tons as against the Hoover figureof 321,000 tons.These tentative proposals of the admiralty were favourably regarded by the Cabinet, particularly inthat they would tend to greater security of our sea-borne
trade.    In the coarse of general discussion suggestions were made as to the best way of presenting theAdmiralty proposals at Geneva.    The Cabinet were informed that Japan would be much more likely toagree to proposals on the Admiralty basis than to. those on the Hoover basis.THE SECRETARY OF&apos; STATE FOR WAR briefly indicated to the Cabinet the position as regards the army.    Afterreferring to possible reductions in the size of heavy-guns and tanks,  the Secretary of State informed theCabinet that his military advisers required considerably more information with regard to the precise meaning ofMr. Hoover&apos;s proposals as regards the personnel of land forces.    Much must depend on precisely what was meantby the expressions &quot;police component&quot; and &quot;defencecomponent&quot; respectively.    As the Cabinet were aware, wehad, in fact, disarmed as regards the army, and were left with little more than an armed police force.    Inthis connection the Cabinet were informed that in a document handed to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs by Mr. Gibson, both the British and Americanarmies were given minus values under a :&apos;defence component&quot;heading.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to variousserious practical difficulties In regard to Mr. Hoover&apos;s land force proposals,  as,  for example,  the very different character of police forces in different countries, the variation in the proportion of police to population, andthe fact that, in certain cases, the defence.element11.
could &quot;be fully justified by political considerations,whereas in others it could not be so justified.The Cabinet agreed-1.    To request the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in consultation withthe Service Ministers and Departmentsconcerned,  to prepare and circulate to the. Cabinet a memorandum embodyinga British plan for disarmament of abold, practical and comprehensivecharacter, on the general linesdiscussed at the meeting!2.    That a meeting of the Cabinet toconsider the Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum should be held in thePrime Minister&apos;s Room, House ofCommons,  on Monday, June 27th,  1932,at 5.30 p.mj3.    That,  in order to secure as large anattendance as possible of cabinet ministers at the Meeting of the Cabineton Monday, June 27th,  the Home secretary and the Secretary of State ,for Air shouldbe communicated with.4&quot;Note8 It was subsequently ascertained that the two ministers In question were returning to Londonforthwith.

I am very disappointed to find thatJayakar a$d Sapru have taken up the attitude displayed in theirtelegram.     I was considerably influenced in coming to a decisionagainst further meetings in London by what I understood wasJayakarfs position.      I am quite convinced that if we have to go through further processes of discussions, no Constitution Billcan be got through next year, and as I think we have everythingto gain by pushing it through, nothing would induce me tosupport a change in our present decision except the mostdefinite proof that otherwise we would forfeit the confidence of India in our work and induce Indians of good-will to thinkthat no one could believe in our word.    I will, however, handyour letter with the papers to Simon, who is returning to london for the Cabinet meeting on Friday, with a copy of this letterattached.We go on here hopefully if with occasional doubts.Yours always,(Sgd.)

SUMMARY OF CONVERSATIONS CONDUCTED BETWEEN FRENCH,AMERICAN AND BRITISH &quot;REPRESEI^ATIVES^^^ENE^A.It may &quot;be advisable to summarise the results of the firstmeetings with the French and American Delegates at Geneva.We have sat so far morning and afternoon on Monday andTuesday and have covered about half of our agenda.     The meet-ings have been most friendly;    there have been no serious dis-agreements and definite conclusions have been reached on severalpoints.     The French have made it clear that, while adhering totheir geaeral position as to the extent of disarmament depend-ing upon adequate measures to ensure further security, they are willing to leave that question in abeyance for the purpose ofthese conversations and to discuss what measures can be agreed on the basis that provisions for security remain as they now are.We took first the question of the prohibition of chemicaland bacteriological warfare as that was the one matter on whicha Commission of Experts had agreed.     We endorsed the recommen-dations of that committee, but emphasis was laid by the Frenchupon the general measures of control to be embodied in the Treatybeing adequate to ensure the observance of prohibition of this form of warfare.     They were also anxious that there should be.special penalties for infraction, but were unable at this stage to suggest what they should be.We next turned to the question of air armaments, as theFrench Delegates were anxious, to have this matter discussed be- .cause one of them - M. de Jouvenel - was to speak on the subject on Wednesday at the meeting of the Air Commission of the Disarma-ment Conference.The British Delegation stated that if it were possible to propose an effective scheme for the entire abolition of militaryand naval aviation and if there were any likelihood of its general acceptance by the Conference, we should not have opposed such a
*s 5 9scheme in principle, but it appeared that those two conditionscould not be fulfilled.     The dangers to which the civil popula-tion might be exposed in time of war,  even if the prohibitionof the use of gas was effective, were emphasised by all partiesto the discussion and there was very complete agreement that definite steps should be taken for their protection.The French proposal, which had been made in a memorandum to the Disarmament Conference dated April 14th, was the main sub-ject for discussion, and it was unanimously accepted as the bestproposition that had been made and as likely to prove adequate for this purpose.     This proposal, which the British Delegateshope may be acceptable to the Cabinet, with the additions made toit as the result of our discussions,  is the following:-Aerial bombing shall be prohibited except:1. In the neighbourhood of actual military operations,that is to say within a certain distance to be fixed,of a line where two military forces are in contactin time of war.     The actual distance is reserved for joint expert examination with the indication thatthe three delegations desire that it should be fixed&quot;at the lowest possible figure consistent with techni-cal realities&quot;.2. In the case of air bases and long-range gun emplacements.3, In a zone to be fixed along the sea coast where bombingwould be permitted within a distance which should bear a relation to the range of naval guns;    and inrespect of objectives, the naval bombardment of whichwas permitted under the Hague Convention.     In other words, the action of aeroplanes in the coastal area will be subject to precisely the same limitations as now extend to naval action.It was made clear that the restriction of bombarding was notto apply to measures taken for the prevention or stopping ofraids or other disturbances in Imperial or Colonial
possessions or Mandated Territories.    Both the French and.American Delegations fully recognised the necessity for thisexception which the British Delegation had urged.     after considering possible formulae for effecting this object,M. Paul-Boncour suggested that it might be most simply done if the restrictions on bombing as specified were to apply, likethe rest of the treaty, as between the High Contracting Parties.By this very simple procedure no restrictions wauld be placed upon any measures which a Power with colonial possessionsmight find it necessary to use in order to assert its authority within those possessions.    (it is possible that difficulty might arise on the North-Western Frontier of Indiaif Afghanistan should become a party to the Convention and ifaggressive action were taken by some of the tribes livingbeyond cur border.    This aspect may require special consideration).     This solution of the question appears to useminently satisfactory if it can secure the assent of theConference as a whole;    it will be an immense relief to thecivil population throughout Europe.    It avoids all difficulties with regard to the definition ef distant military objectives:such problems as whether the presence of an arsenal or abarracks or a munition factory in a particular town would render legitimate the dropping of bombs on that town will nolonger arise.With regard to restrictions on the size of bombingaeroplanes, here again we have reached a provisional agreement.It is proposed that the maximum unladen weight should be 3tons (not 5 tons as previously suggested).    The British Delega-*tion pointed ouythe necessity, however, cf not preventing theuse of large planes for carrying troops or stores in oversea
territories and this was at once recognised by the other twodelegations.      It was agreed, however, that the number of suchplanes should he limited and  the  tentative suggestion was made that the number should he fixed in relation to the size ofthe garrisons where the troops were stationed.The Americans asked that flying-boats should also be the -subject of special exemption.      Agreement was reached on theprinciple that there should be exceptions in these and possiblysome other cases, and the formulation of the conditions of such exceptions was referred to a joint Committee of the experts ofeach delegation.      (It was also decided that with regard tothis and other matters the meetings of experts should be attended by political members of the delegations.The question of fixing a maximum unit volume fordirigibles was also referred for expert consideration.There was a general desire that the numbers of militaryand naval aeroplanes possessed by each country should belimited, but no progress was made as to finding a principle onwhich the numbers should be based.      The French fully agreedthat it would not be right to relate the numbers of aeroplanesto the size of armies as this would put the countries withoutconscript armies at a very unfair disadvantage.      It was thought possible, however, that after further study some basisof agreement might &quot;be reached as between the three delegations sthough we are ourselves inclined to doubt whether any rule islikely to be found which would be acceptable to Italy andother Powers.      The experts are also to consider whether thereshould be a limit of total tonnage as well as a limit of numbers.We next turned to what has been called the French Plan forthe Internationalisation Of Civil Aviation, but which as.(tv)
appeared, from the explanations that were given is quitewrongly designated by that name.      In the first place,  thenowFrench do noj/ propose that whatever measures are adoptedshould apply to any hut the largest aeroplanes, that is those over 3 tons, possession of which is to he prohibited to governments - except for a limited number of troop-carriers.The question of any form of control of manufacture, or of licensing the possession, of the  ordinary small plane owned by private individuals does not therefore arise.      Secondly,the French are not now putting forward their plan for placinglarge planes at the disposal of the League of Nations.      Theactual project now before us is for a measure of international control over the big air liners, the object being to preventthe formation, with the help of subsidies, of powerful fleets oflarge planes, which a country which was prepared to break thelaw might use most destructively for bombing.     The Frenchlaid great emphasis upon the necessity for this, and indexeddeclared definitely that they would not agree to the abolitionof the large bombing machine unless effective means were taken tprevent planes of similar size, ostensibly provided for civilian purposes, being available as substitutes.      Theirpresent plan, which has been worked out in great detail, isin effect the creation of an international organisation on lines more or less resembling the Wagon-Lit Company, which is to run the long-distance air services much as the sleeping-cartrains are run.      Special provision should be made to ensurethat countries which desire to see established long-distancelines to their colonial or other possessions should be ableto secure that this would be effected through the internationalcompany.      It is claimed that, apart from the first
consideration that has been mentioned, this plan would he desirable in itself as it would prevent the unnecessarymultiplication of competing air lines and would greatlydiminish the amount of subsidies paid, by the various governments.      We feel some doubt whether such a scheme would work efficiently and whether it is not more elaborate than theconditions require;    it might be possible to have a more restricted form of control under the supervision of the Leagueof Nations which would effect the main purpose in view.      Butit is obviously important not to impose a direct negative uponthe French proposal and we readily agreed to the suggestion oftheir delegation that the Air Committee of the conference should appoint a smaller sub-committee to go into this subjectmore closely.At our fourth meeting we discussed questions of qualitativeland disarmament, and first the proposal with regard to heavy artillery.      Here we were hoping to secure an agreement forthe prohibition of mobile land guns of a calibre above about&quot; (155mm).      M, Paul-Boncour raised a point, however, whichis undoubtedly of serious importance.      He pointed out thatit was  impossible to require coastal defences to be provided with guns of a smaller calibre than those of the ships which might attack them.      The forts of Marseilles could notbe limited to 6&quot; guns to meet an attack from battleshipsarmed with 12&quot; guns.      But in&apos; the view of the French delegation and their military advisers it was not in fact possible toprevent guns authorised for coastal defence from being usedin land warfare.      If one country attacked another, havingbroken the pact against going to war,it.would not scruple tobreak a convention which prohibited it from using its coastaldefence guns in the campaign, while the defending country could
not be    expected to refrain from doing so in resisting the aggression.    As a matter of fact, he said, many of thesecoastal defence guns were not physically fixed; they were already mounted on rails in order that they^ might be movedfraim one loop-hole of a fort to another and to transfer themto the ordinary railways was a simple matter.    With regard to others, it was not the case that it would take very long to manufacture the mountings necessary to convert them from fixedto mobile artillery.    Furthermore,  it is necessary that theconvention should be easily enforceable and that infractionsshould be verifiable without too much difficulty, but if guns of heavy calibre were still to be permissible for coastaldefences and for ships it would be impossible to say that anysuch guns that were being manufactured were really intended forland warfare.In the course of the discussion the French Delegationagreed:-1.    That whatever figure was agreed internationally, either by the Washington Convention or by the Convention nowunder negotiation, for the maximum calibre of navalguns, they would agree also as the maximum for landartillery.2.    That a figure should be fixed with expert advice which should be regarded .as the maximum size of thenormal artillery required by armies.3.    That heavy land artillery above that calibre shouldbe limited in number, that the allocation of eachpiece should be registered with the Commission ofControl and that the number of such guns at presentexisting should not be exceeded, although there mightbe replacements.Turning to tanks, it was agreed that the complete abolitionof tanks was wr*ng in principle and could not be adopted.(vii)
*S (* Vel 6 5With regard to the maximum weight, the French were quitewilling to fix a limit.    They had a considerable number of tankscf 70 tons, and their experts hitherto had suggested that as theappropriate maximum.    M. Paul-Boncour, however, understood thatthe British Goverment favoured a figure of about 25 tons and hewas willing to approximate to that.    The French had, however,a number of tanks of a 25 ton pattern, the weight of which hadbeen considerably increased by the attachment of much heaviercaterpillars, bringing them up to about 32 tons, and he would suggest that as the limit.    We asked whether that might not bevery considerably reduced, but were met by the argument that itwas a question of what weight was adequate to give sufficientarmour protection against ordinary artillery used by armies.M. Paul*Boncour suggested that it was a matter for joint expertdetermination to decide how that principle should be applied and what weight of tank should be agreed to as the outcome.    we suggested that existing tanks over the agreed limit should be scrapped. - a proposal which the French did not reject, but they asked for an opportunity to give it further consideration.The American Delegation indicated that their Governmentwould have been glad to see the total abolition of tanks, but if that were impossible they would co-operate in finding a maximumlimit of size.We have had informal conservations with Signor Grand! andwith Herr Nadolny, the German Delegate, in order to keep theminformed of the course of events.(Intd.)     ij.s,1 L.H.S.&quot;June 21st,  1932.GENEVA.
