THE CHILDREN    1. In connection with the ConclusionAND YOUNGPERSONS BILL, referred to in the margin, the Cabinet had before-j  c * o  athem a Memorandum (Paper CP. 221 (32)) by theHome Secretary covering a Memorandum by the parliamentary under Secretary of State for Home Affairs on thesituation that has been created by the action of theHouse of Lords in inserting an amendment into the(previous reference       Children and Young Persons Bill, dealing with theCabinet23 (32)-employment of persons between the ages of 14 and 18Conclusion 2).in the &quot;unregulated occupations&quot;.7&quot;(%)/o It was suggested In the Home Secretary&apos;sMemorandum that the amendment should be accepted,subject to a modification of wording te secure thatthe Resolution to bring the new clause into operation should only originate with the Government, and thatit should not be open to any private Member to move the Resolution,It was also pointed out that the suspensoryprovision puts the matter on a different footing fromhitherto;    it will be an answer to opponents of theproposal, who may complain that they have been out-manoeuvred, and with the acquiescence of the Government;and that should the Home Office be able, as the outcome of inquiries now about to be undertaken, to framealternative proposals on better lines, it could stilldo so, and present its new scheme in a Bill asintended.    That Bill would supersede the conditionalclause now proposed to be added to the Statute Book,and the clause could be repealed, without having beenput into effect, at the same time that the better provision was enacted.
After the Parliamentary Under Secretary of Statefor Home Affairs had fully explained the position,,  theCabinet were informed by the Lord Privy Seal of the reasons which had led to the acceptance of Lord AstorTs amendment.On that occasion it had been made clear to the House ofLords that while the Government did not agree with themethod of dealing with the matter contemplated in theamendment, their acceptance of the amendment must beregarded as a declaration of their sympathy with the object in view, and of their intention to deal with the questionthough on somewhat different lines.The Cabinet agreed  (1) To approve the Home Secretary&apos;proposal in Paper CP.  221 (32) viz:&apos; thatthe House of Commons should beinvited to agree to the amendment ofthe Children and Young Persons Billby the House of Lords as regards the insertion of the new clause dealingwith the employment of persons betweenthe ages of 14 and 18 in the &quot;unregulatedoccupations&quot;, subject to the modificationsuggested by the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State for Home Affairs.(2) That the Government spokesman should beauthorised, in the course of the debate to state that it was theintention of the Government to dealwith the matter during the lifetime ofthe present Parliament in legislation which would inter alia supersede theconditional clause now proposed to beinserted in the Bill.
TON 2.     The cabinet were informed, that no important IRS.GENEVA news had as yet been received from Geneva.    ThereLAUSANNEiRENCES* had, however, been a message from Lausanne to theeffect that the situation was developing satisfactorily.eviousferencebinet 39(32)iiclusion 1 )o
THE SITUATIONIN THE IRISHFREE STATE.F-fi.(PreviousReferenceCabinet36 (32)Conclusion 3.)3* In pursuance of the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had before them aMemorandum (Paper CP. 227 (32)) by the Secretaryof State for Dominion jAffairs, covering thefollowing documents :-Annex I.   A Memorandum (Paper I.S.C.(32)36)circulated to the Irish situation committee by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs on possible courses ofaction which might be adopted.Annex II.   Memoranda by the Departmentsconcerned as to the possible nature andeffects of special measures designed to recoup to the United Kingdom exchequer the sum likely to be withheld by theIrish Free State on account of the land annuities.In his Memorandum (CP. 227 (32)), theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs expressedthe opinion that on balance a selective tariff on thelines indicated in Appendix I to Annex II would bethe least disadvantageous method of procedure, if itwas decided to recoup ourselves.   An alternativetoproposal, namely to omit or substantially/lower theduty on livestock and to make up the loss ofarrangementrevenue by terminating the Double Income Tax/ was open to the grave objections set out in paragraphs and 9 of the Memorandum.It would be assumed that the specialselective tariff on Irish Free State imports would^     A..    ..
be in addition to, and would not affect the incidence of,the duties to which, in the absence of action to thecontrary, imports from the Irish Free State will be liablunder the Import Duties Act after 15th November, 1932The Secretary of State also recommended that thelegislation should take the form of the grant of a general power to impose, vary or remove duties on all commoditiesimported from the Irish Free State, leaving details to be worked out and put into effect by administrative Ofcder inthe light of the development of the situation.The Departmental Memoranda in Annex II wereAppendix I.    A Memorandum by the Board of Customssetting out alternative tariffs and explaining theadministrative and other difficulties involved.. Inparticular attention was drawn to the greatcomplications in the Customs administration of theFree State - Northern Ireland border involved inthe imposition of the additional duties.Appendix II.   A Memorandum by the Board of InlandRevenue on the consequences and reactions of the cancellation of the Double Income Tax arrangements between the two countries.Appendix III.   A Memorandum by the Treasury to theeffect that there is no other financial sanction, bywhich we can exact .^ao3T -&amp;tibstaB&amp;&amp;&amp;) sum from theIrish Free. State 5   on the other hand.Free Statedefault on-, the Bonds under the Land Act of 1923would involve the United Kingdom Government in serious liabilities under their guarantee.
Appendix IV.     A Memorandum &quot;by the Board of Trade,on the importance of our export trade to the FreeState, and on the retaliatory measures (withdrawalof existing preferences, imposition of discriminatoryduties on United Kingdom goods, special taxation onre-exports from the United Kingdom) which the FreeState Government could apply in answer to tariffaction directed against exports of Free Stateproducts to the United Kingdom,The Cabinet also had before them a Note(Paper CP.  833(32)) by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs, covering the preliminary draft of a Bill which Parliamentary Counsel hasprepared with a view to indicating the kind oflegislation which would be necessary if theCabinet adopted the policy recommended in annex I (Paper I.S.C.   (32) 36) to CP.  227(32).
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs reminded the Cabinet of the present position with regardto the question of the Land Annuities.    Payment wouldhave to be made by the British Government to the holders of about  1,250,000 on the 1st July, and theGovernment of the Irish Free State had clearly intimatedtheir intention to with-hold payment of the amount dueto the British Government, and had,  in fact, rejected the offer of that Government that the question a tissue should be submitted for determination to an empire tribunal.    It was most important that for thepresent the question of the Land Annuities should be keptdistinct from the question of the Oath of Allegiance.There were various courses open to the BritishGovernment, under which that Government might hope to recoup itself for the loss; and he most stronglyrecommended the Cabinet to adopt the principle of theimmediate passage of legislation giving theGovernment power by administrative order to impose (andto remove) duties up to a stated limit, on all or&apos; anycommodities imported from the Irish Free State.    this method was preferable to the levying of duties on IrishFree State products similar to those payable by foreigncountries under the Import Duties Act.Any attempt to recover our loss by denunciation of the double Income Tax Agreement would re-act mostprejudicially against the friends of the BritishGovernment in the Irish Free State, and would be, nodoubt, welcomed on that account by Mr. de Valera.Some action must clearly be taken in view of thestate of public opinion in Parliament and throughout the
country.   An early General Election in the Irish Free   ..   :* 1State Y/as inevitable, and if the Government failedto take action to re over their Land Annuity and othermonetary losses with which they were threatened, Mr.Gosgrave and his supporters, who had warned the Irishelectorate of the probable consequences of Mr. De Valera&apos;policy, would be in grave danger of defeat.     The actionto be taken must be taken before the United kingdom delegation left for the Ottawa Conference.It must be clearly understood that the policy recommended might, and probably would, provoke reprisals;but the British Government could not possibly allow thepresent Government of the Irish Free State to violateagreements with impunity.    Every possible step had beentaken to avoid the present impasse, and after most careful examination it had not been found possible to discoverany satisfactory alternative to the policy now suggested.The documents had been sent to the Prime Minister and hiscolleagues at Lausanne, and the Prime Minister had informed the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that, while hegreatly regretted the necessity for taking action, he agreedthat there was no other alternative.Doubts were expressed whether it was desirablethat the Cabinet should take a decision on this mostimportant question in the absence of the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade.   Having regard to the importance of our exporttrade to the Irish Free State, it was very desirable that,if possible, the Cabinet should hear the views of the.President of the Board of Trade before deciding to embark on a policy which might result in a tariff war, whichwould certainly have deplorable reactions on employment inthe United Kingdom.      The policy would, it was represented,merely postpone instead of avoiding the Parliamentarydifficulty.
On the other hand,  it was pointed out that theproposed legislation involved a &quot;ways and means&quot; resolution,and that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury had estimated that If the Cabinet came to a decision on that day to proceed with the contemplated legislation, theBill might reach the House of Lords on Friday, July 8th,and could only pass that House at the earliest byTuesday, July 12th, the day before the United kingdom delegation sailed for the Ottawa Conference.    With regardto possible retaliation by the Irish Free State, theCabinet were reminded of the tariff action whichthe Free State Government had already taken against theUnited Kingdom, and of the grave restrictions which werebeing imposed on United Kingdom companies operating inthe Free State.    It was very difficult to estimatewhat retaliatory action the Free State might take Ibutit must be remembered that Free State exports to theUnited Kingdom constituted   85    per cent,  of her total exports, while United Kingdom exports to the Free Stateconstituted only   q   per cent of our total exports.General agreement was expressed with the view thatthe action proposed was necessary, and that the real question was whether the United Kingdom would continueto trade with the Irish Free State or not.   At theforthcoming general election in Ireland the success ofMr. Cosgrave and his party would mean a return of free trade between the Free State and the United Kingdom.The time factor concerned the Free State as much as itconcerned Great Britain,  inasmuch as the longer we delayedto take action,  the more convinced Mr. de Valera and his supporters would be that we had no real intention ofresorting to extreme measures.    In this connection attention
was drawn to the form of the proposed Bill? which made it clear that we were not Initiating a tariff war, hutwere endeavouring to recoup ourselves for losses sustained through a breach of contract by the IrishFree State.It was also urged that the issue went deeperthan any question of trade, since it really involved the whole question of sovereignty.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL informed theCabinet that he had, with great regret, reached theconclusion that there was no alternative policy to that suggested by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Under the Bill, as drafted, the Government would take power to impose duties, and the Board of Trade and theother Departments concerned would have to investigate the whole position with the greatest possible care beforeaction under the Bill was taken.    After reminding theCabinet that the documents under consideration had been for some time in me hands of the Prime Minister and hiscolleagues at Lausanne, and that no objection had been raised to the policy proposed, the Lord President ofthe Council informed the Cabinet that it would be necessaryto take the Committee stage of the Financial resolution of the Bill on Monday next, July 4th, if the Bill wasto pass through its remaining stages in time to enable it to reach the House of Lords on Friday, July 8th.
While he was satisfied that it was necessary forthe Government to take the general powers proposed in theBill, how exactly those powers would he used would he for theCabinet to determine after exhaustive examination of the whole position by the Departments concerned.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES mentioned the difficulty with regard to store cattle.    He was advised that in the first instance the Irish farmers would probably have to pay any duty that might be imposed on such cattleimported from the Free State.    In any case he had no hesitation in advising that cattle should be included in the proposedtariff scheme.In reply to an enquiry whether it was proposedto make immediate use of the powers contained in the Bill,the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs expressed the viewthat to obtain those powers and then not to use them would be disastrous..    He contemplated that use would be made ef thepowers as soon as possible after the Cabinet had takendecisions on the results of the Departmental examination ofthe various commodities.The Cabinet were warned that the effect in the IrishFree State of the proposed policy might be greatly to stimulatenationalist feeling.      If Mr. De Valera came to the conclusionthat the policy was likely to prejudice his chances in theelection, he was in a position to postpone the election andto indulge in a tariff war.      On the other hand, if he decidedto have an immediate General Election and was returned to power, the Government would be faced with a political andeconomic problem of a most serious and embarrassing character.
Doubts were expressed whether the policy would,if adopted, enable us to recoup our financial losses,and it was represented that on balance we might wellbe losers.The strength of the considerations in favour of thepolicy recommended by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the absence of any alternative policy were, however, fully admitted by the wholeC ab ine t.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposal of the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs contained in paper CP.  227 (32) and Annex I to that document, namely, that steps should betaken forthwith to secure the immediatepassage of legislation giving theGovernment power by Administrative Qrderto impose (and also to remove) duties upto a stated limit on all or any commoditiesimoorted from the Irish Pree State.The Cabinet next examined the draft (IrishPree State (Special Import Duties) Bill) annexed to paper cp. 233 (32) and approved the draft Bill, subject tothe following amendments and qualifications;-Clause I(l). The opening words of this sub-clauseto be amended to read somewhat as follows:-&quot;If it appears to the Treasury that by reasonof any failure of the Government of theIrish Pree State to implement their obligations to this country,  there has resulted or islikely .........&quot;Clause 1(1) Line 8.    The expression &quot;Afterconsultation with&quot; in line 8 to &quot;to be interested&quot;in line 12 to be omitted, unless the Treasuryattach great importance to the insertion in theBill of one of the alternative sentences in square brackets.    In this event, the second alternative,namelyj-
&quot;Any Government Department which appears to the  .    *Treasury to he interested&quot;should he Inserted in the Bill,Clause 1(2)(h). &quot;One hundred&quot; to stand as drafted.Clause l(4). The First of the two alternative sub-clauses (4) to be incorporated in the Bill.Clauses II and III.    The short alternative for Clauses2 and 3.set out on page 7 of the draft to he incorporated in the Bill in substitution for the longer form set outon pages 4, 5 and 6 of the draft.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the followingpoints arising on the Bill which had been raised by theBoard of Trade?-(1)   As the Bill was worded at present, Irish FreeState goods might escape a special duty if imported intothe United Kingdom by way of a foreign country.(2)    Foreign countries having *mast-favoured-nation1rights might find that their goods exported to the UnitedKingdom by way of the Irish Free State paid a higher rateof duty than if exported direct, and might claim that a breach of treaty had occurred.The Cabinet agreed:-(l)    To request the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to confer with theBoard of Trade in regard to the points raised by that Department.(2)    To approve the draft Irish Free State(Special Import Duties) Bill subjectto the amendments and alterationsindicated above, and to the resultsof the discussion in (l) above.(3)    To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the Bill inthe form of the draft approved by theCabinet, subject to any drafting orother minor amendments which may befound necessary or desirable, on theunderstanding that steps will be takento secure the passage of the Bill into law with the least possible delay.
(4)    To request the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,  after consultationwith the Treasury and all other. Departments concerned,  to prepare and circulate to the Cabinet forconsideration at their Meeting onWednesday, July 6th, the draft of anOrder setting out his proposals inregard to the specific commodities to be subject to duty on the cominginto operation of the Irish Free State(Special Import Duties) Act.
- ^ 4174.        The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Financial Secretary to the Treasury(Paper H.A. 28 (32)) covering the draft Isle ofMan (Customs)  (No 2) Bill, the main objects of whichare Part I - (a)  to give to the Governor of the isle of Man substantially the same executive powers in regard to the new import duties as are given tothe Treasury and the Board of Trade and His majesty in Council, under existing United Kingdom legislation,and (b) to apply to the Isle of Man those changesin Customs duties in the United Kingdom which have occurred since the last Isle of Man Customs Actwas passed.     Part II of the Bill represents thenormal annual Bill, applying to the Isle of Man the changes in the Customs law made in this yearrsBudget.The Cabinet were informed that, the Bill,which is non-contentious, must be passed into law before the adjournment, and that while there had been-no opportunity of submitting the Bill to the Committeeof Home Affairs, it had been discussed with, and inprinciple agreed by, the Attorney General of the isle of Man.  -The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the introduction in theHouse of Commons of the Isle of Man(Customs)(No.2) Bill in the form ofthe draft annexed to H.A.28(32),subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable, on the understanding thatarrangements will be made to secure thepassage of the Bill into law before the summer Recess,
THE VISITINGFORGESf &quot;BRITISH^COMMONWEALTH)BILL.(PreviousReferenceCabinet28 (32)).5. With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had before them aMemorandum (Paper H.A* 29 (32)) by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, covering the draftVisiting Forces (British Commonwealth) Bill, thehistory and object of which was explained in aNote prepared in the Dominions Office,It was stated in the Memorandum that this bill ought strictly to have been enacted so as tocome into operation simultaneously with the expiringof the 1931 Army and Air Force (Annual) Act of the30th April last.     The chief urgency is to secure thepassage of similar legislation as soon as possible bythe Dominion Parliaments, and this can best besecured by our setting them an example.     No seriousinconvenience was, however, anticipated if the present bill is passed into law some time during the present session.The Cabinet agreed - To authorise the introduction inthe House of Lords of the visiting forces (British Commonwealth) Billin the form of the draft annexed to H.A. 29 (32), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable, and on the understandingthat while the Bill should be passed into law during the present session, there was no special reasonwhich rendered necessary itsenactment before the Summer Recess.

Since -January last only three applicationsof a total value of less than  20,000 have beenreceived by the Lewis Committee, all of which havebeen rejected as not satisfying the ordinaryconditions of the grant.The Lord President&apos;s.
