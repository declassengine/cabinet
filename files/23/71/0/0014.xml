l    employment policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(33), Con-clusion 5.)5. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (C.P.-187 (32)) on thesubject of the prospective employment situation,intimating that in the absence of a substantialrecovery in the trade of the world we were likelyto be faced with a volume of unemployment next winter greater than anything experienced previously .A short discussion took place on the above memorandum., in the course of which the Ministerof Labour gave some figures to show that theposition was, perhaps, not quite so bad as indicatedtherein, owing to the effect of the Whitsuntideholiday.    Some unemployment, he added, was due tothe recent floods.   He feared, however, that theunemployment estimates on which the Budget had been based could not possibly be realised.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave somefigures as to the probable effect on the budget of the estimated increase in the unemployment figures, but asked that his colleagues, in any public statements, should not say anything toencourage a spirit of pessimism.
parliamentary procedure.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(33)% Con-clusion 2 .)6..   After a short discussion, the Cabinet agreedThat on the conclusion of the present session, Parliament should be askedto adjourn and should not be prorogued,and that the decision should be upheldon the ground, that legislation mightbe required at short notice as theresult of one or other of the Confer-ences now in being or about to takeplace.
7. The President of the Board of Trade made ashort verbal report to the Cabinet on the satisfactoryconeIns ion of the Coal negotiations.   He paid a tribute to Mr Evan Williams and to Mr Ebby Edwardsfor their assistance from the point of view of theOwners and the Miners respectively.    He added thatthe point which was most exercising the minds ofthe miners was that at the end of the twelve months the National Industrial Board should exercise somefunctions.   That raised the question of negotiations between the Owners and the Miners.    Up to the presenttime the Owners had boycotted the Board, and theOwners who were members of the Board were merenominees of the Government and in no way repre-sentative.    Pie hoped, however, that he mightsucceed in persuading the Owners to take some active part in the Board, without interfering in rates ofwages .The Prime Minister said that this was a goodpiece of business accomplished.
