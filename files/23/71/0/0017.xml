RAQ, With reference to the conclusion mentionedHE SITUATION$ REGARD TO      in the margin/ the Cabinet had before them a Note byHE IRAQSVXBS, the Deputy Secretary (CP, 808 (32)) covering atelegram from the High Commissioner of Iraq, dated15th June, a copy of which, for convenience of reference,is attached (see Appendix I).The telegram-in question was read to theCabinet, special attention being drawn to the concluding passage in the third paragraph &quot;it is(PreviousJReferen.ee -unanimous opinion of experts here that there is everyICabinet 35(32)jConclusion 1) prospective^ 0f situation of utmost gravity developingwhich may wreck work of ten years&quot;,.    In a privatetelegram to the High Commissioner (see Appendix II)the Secretary of State for the Colonies had explainedthat the Cabinet refusal to sanction the use of Britishtroops to hold       the levies applied both to disbandedman and to a disarmed but uniformed force, that theWar Office had absolutely declined to contemplate the dispersal of the Battalion by Companies as proposed,. and considered that one Battalion would be insufficient.The telegram concluded as follows :-&quot;(3) You know that Government always attach great weight to your views and I want to assure you that decision of Cabinet wastaken with full regard to your estimateof eventualities if levies were ps rmittedto join concentration;    and becauseCabinet felt that notwithstanding thoserisks, they would not be justified in-sending British troops.&quot;It was suggested to the Cabinet that Sir P.Humphrysf knowledge of the facts and his judgment withregard to Oriental situations made the warning termsof his t telegram all the more serious.     The Cabinet ,
inshould he prepared to accept as a fair appreciation of theposition, Sir F. Humphrys&apos;  statement.      In effect, if theCabinet maintained the- present decision not to send re-inforcements, they ought to take the further decision ofiwhat was to be done, in the event of Sir F. Humphrys&apos;  forecast of a situation of the utmost gravity developing.     Were theCabinet prepared to decide now that in that event they would notsend any British forces to Iraq?     On the other hand, if theCabinet were not prepared to take this larger decision, therewas considerable force in the suggestion that if smalltemporary reinforcements were sent now, the risk of having tosend very large reinforcements later on would be minimised.Assuming that Sir F. Humphrys was right in theestimate which he had formed of the position     -    that if noreinforcements were sent there was every prospect of serious and wide-spread trouble with which the Government of Iraqwould be quite incapable of dealing -it became necessary toconsider the present legal position.Our relations with Iraq are at present regulated by the Anglo-Iraq Treaties of 192S (and subsidiary Agreements)and 1926.     The former Treaty defined British military commitments as follows&quot;Article 7.    His Britannic Majesty undertakes to provide such support and assistance to the armed forces of His Majesty the King of Iraqas may from time to time be agreed by theHigh Contracting Parties.   A separate agreementregulating the extent and conditions of such support and assistance shall be concludedbetween the High Contracting Parties andcommunicated to the Council of the League ofNations.&quot;&quot;The essential features of the separate agreementmentioned in this article (The Military agreement concluded in 1924) were as follows : -
Jfi -**4U6&quot;Article 1.    The two Governments herebyrecognise the principle that the GovernmentPf Iraq shall, at the earliest possible date, provided it shall not be later than four years from the date of the conclusionof this agreement, accept full responsibility,both for the maintenance of internal order and for the defence of Iraq, from external aggression.     With this end in view, it is agreed that the material support and assistance now being rendered by HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government to theGovernment of Iraq shall be progressively reduced with all possible expedition.Article 2,    Such support and assistance asmay for a time be provided by the Government.,of His Britannic Majesty shall take the formof the presence in Iraq either of an Imperialgarrison or of local forces maintained by HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government....Article 8.    The Iraq Government shall notbe entitled to the assistance of any forcesmaintained or controlled by His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government against or for the suppression of any external aggression orany civil disturbance or armed rising, whichshall, in the opinion of the High Commissioner,have been provoked or occasioned by action taken or policy pursued by the Iraq Governmentcontrary to the advice or express wishes ofHis Britannic Majesty&quot;.llThe Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1926 extended the duration of the 1922 Treaty;    but it did not expressly alter the provision of Article 1 of theMilitary Agreement quoted above, that Iraq was totake over full responsibility for her defence and security in 1928.Although the instruments referred to do notplace a definite obligation upon H.M.G. to come tothe assistance of the Iraqi Government in the eventof internal disorder or external attack,  such an obligation is implicit in the terms of Article 8 ofthe Military Agreement of 1924 quoted above&apos; .It must be remembered that hitherto we had maintainedthe principle that provided the policy followed by the iraqi government was a policy approved by the High Commissioner,the Iraqi Government were entitled to British support.It could not, however, be denied   that we alone must be themayjudges of what forces we/decide to send under the terms ofthese instruments,,  and if the Cabinet decided that, for
political and military reasons,it would &quot;be impossible infuture to send British troops to iraqj this, of course,meant that we would not send troops, however great andpressing the emergency.     If Iraq entered the League of rations in September next, we e^aid/ only thereafter sendBritish troops if British lives were in danger.Doubt was expressed whether it was really necessaryfor the Cabinet to take any general decision not to send troops to Iraq in the future.     Each case should be treatedon its merits, and the present case could probably be satisfactorily solved if the Iraqi Government would givethe Assyrians a larger measure of self-government.     Onthe other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that the mandates commission had rejected the Assyrian contentions in thisrespect, and that in any case long before any decision inthe     Governmentthe matter could be reached,/Iraq/would be faced with aninsurrection which it would be very difficult to suppress.There was some evidence that the movement among the levieswas part of a scheme designed seriously to embarrass, ifnot to overturn,, the Iraqi Government.     The Assyrians wereresolute men, and the advent of British reinforcementsmight well precipitate the very crisis which they werebeing sent to avert,In reply to Members of the Cabinet who had been unable to be present at the Meeting on June 13th., theSecretary of State for War explained the military(climatic and strategic) objections entertained by theMilitary Authorities to the sending of reinforcementsas suggested by the High Commissioner.
In the course of subsequent discussion, theview was expressed that the sickness risks had beenexaggerated, and that the Military authorities had over estimated the purely military risks involved.In this connection, the suggestion was made that inorder to avoid the division of the Battalion into fourscattered Companies, the Assyrians themselves migbt be concentrated in one or two internment camps.In reply to enquiries the CHIEF OF THE AIRSTAFF laid considerable emphasis on the consideration that the presence of British troops would inspire confidence and give many of the levies an excuse forremaining loyal.   He (Sir John Salmond) was entirelysatisfied that the High Commissioner had most carefully considered the whole position and &apos; the risks involvedbefore tendering his advice.     In three out of the fourplaces where it was proposed to station the Britishtroops, there were Flights of the Royal Air Force andBattalions or portions of Battalions of the Iraqi Army,The road communications were good, and the intention wasnot    to use- the British troops for the purpose ofdisarming the levies, but only for the purpose of exercising moral authority.     If the levies resisteddisarmament, the Air Officer Commanding did not proposeto take drastic action.      He doubted whether Iraqitroops would prove satisfactory as guards for- the levies, even after the latter had been disarmed, buthe had no doubts whatever that British troops would be entirely satisfactory in this respects
6.It was pointed out that in effect the British Military Authorities were being asked to take very big risks merelyin order that British troops should beprovided to guard a number of disarmed menrmany of whom would succeed in slipping away,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCILthanked the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, the Chief of the Air Staff and thePermanent Under Secretary of State for theColonies, who then withdrew from the Meeting,
The Cabinet considered their decision not to sendreinforcements in the light of the most recent telegrams from the British Authorities in Iraq..Grave doubts were felt as to the wisdom of differingin such a very important matter from Sir F. Humphrys, whoseadvice had been given in the light of full knowledge of thelocal circumstances, and in whose ability,  judgment anddiscretion the Cabinet had.the most complete confidence.It was urged that the Government would be very severely criticised if, having failed to accept the High Commissionersrecommendation,  they had to face a first-class crisis inIraq.On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that,as a result of the reductions which had taken place, our army was no longer commensurate in size with our world-wideobligations and responsibilities, and that, in fact, itwould be extremely difficult to spare a Battalion of Britishtroops from Egypt.      The political and religious objectionsto the use of Indian troops were insuperable, and even if british troops could be spared from India, they could notarrive in Iraq for some months, and time was of the essence of the matter.There was some support for the view that, if the* health&apos; factor could be disregarded,  the Cabinet would be wise to reconsider their previous decision and to authorisethe despatch of a British Battalion to Iraq.      The cabinet were reminded, however, that the Army Council&apos;s objections to the proposal were not only &apos;health&apos;objections (in this connection the attention of the cabinet was directed to the serious warning
contained in the Note by the Director-General of medical Services (Cabinet 36 (32) Appendix I)), but were also military objections.     Moreover, certain members of the Cabinet laid emphasis on the importanceof the purely political objections to the proposal,THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said thatthe problem before the Cabinet was one of extreme difficulty.     He personally was very much impressed bythe very grave character of the warning contained in Sir P, Humphrys&apos; most recent appreciation of the sit-uation, and he was very apprehensive of the serious consequences which must inevitably result from a wrongdecision.     He suggested that the Secretary ff State forWar should confer immediately with his Military Advisers,should represent to them that it was not improbable thatthe Government might be faced within the next few days witha situation of the utmost gravity, and should invite themto re-examine their objections to the reinforcementproposal, as the problem upon which they might have \oadvise in the immediate future was one of the greatestmagnitude.The Cabinet agreed(l) To request the Secretary of Statefor War.to confer with his military Advisers forthwith on thelines suggested by the lord president of the Council,(2) To request the Secretary af State forthe Colonies to despatch to Sir P,Humphrys a telegram, the terms ofwhich he should agree with theSecretary of State for War and theSecretary of State for Air.    The telegram to deal inter alia with the following matters(a) Health: the High Commissioner should -be asked to state what risks to health,in his opinion, are involved and whatprecautionary measures already existor could be made available, before the arrival of British reinforcements:
(&quot;b) Mi I i t ary ob j e c t i cms;    the purely military objections of the War Officeto the reinforcement proposals shouldhe fully explained.     Sir P. Humphrysshould be informed as to the minimum requirements on which the military advisers of the Secretary of State forWar would insist before they couldassent to the despatch of reinforcements,and he should be asked whether the reinforcement proposal as accepted bythe War Office would suffice for hispurposes:(c) Sir P. Humphrys should also be askedto state the latest date on which there reinforcements should arrive if theyare to be of any use;(&amp;) Political considerationsa    The political objections to sending British troops toIraq, at the present time should be explained, and Sir P. Humphrys shouldbe asked inter alia how the troops could prevent the levies from dispersing;whether, in the last resort, it was proposed to shoot down unarmed levies:how long was it anticipated that the.British Battalion might have to beretained: and why was it impossible touse Iraqi troops to hold the levies.(e) Sir F. Humphrys should&apos; be informed thatthe Cabinet attached very great importanceto a fair settlement of Assyrian politicalclaims.   It would be preferable to over-come difficulty by political means ratherthan by show of force.*NOTE.       For the terms of telegrams^asdespatched see Appendix III..;S, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.16th June, 1932.
No.  205    15th June.I have discussed your telegram No.151 with Air OfficerCommanding,We note that it is not considered advisable either inprinciple or in practice to accede to our request in certain circum-stances for outside assistance but we feel that conclusion (3) isbased on a complete misapprehension of our proposals.     My telegramNo,201 described (? action) recommended as disarming levies and re-taining them in uniform under military law in their stations (withtheir families).      Disbandment was to be avoided partly in theinterests of Assyrians themselves.     Levies would continue to drawrations and pay and would be given excuse which many are believed to desire to serve on and be spared a life of poverty.      It was\ felt that mere presence of British troops would preserve calm andiinspire confidence all round.Our plan of keeping levies under restraint was also;]intended to fulfil what we held to be our obligation towards iraqi government by preventing dangerous concentration at most inopportuneImoment.     To disband levies and leave them free to join concentrationiin North seemed to us to involve grave risk of,    (a) desertion ofjAssyrians in Iraq police and army, still engaged in Barzan operations1(b) Assyrian concentration, which Iraq Government are at presentpowerless to control, becoming a menace to peace and finally beingl&amp;eans (which may well be in the minds of leaders) of postponement offraq&apos;s entry into League,    (c) suspicion being aroused in mind ofIraqis, if we allow matters to take their course, that H.M.GovernmentCYPHEH TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner of Iraq, to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies,Da.ted 15th June,    Received Colonial Office    3,15 p.m.  15th June, 1932,
have connived at Assyrian Coup de main which will havebeen facilitated by 5437 rifles issued by us in thepast to discharged Levy soldiers.When once Assyrians have been allowed to carryout their plan of concentration unhampered and haveburnt their boats.in regard to service, both in Britishand Iraqi forces (involving a gratuitous loss in pay ofmany thousands of pounds a month), it is unanimous opinionof experts here that there is every prospect of situation of utmost gravity developing which may wreck work of tenyears.It was these considerations which induced air officer Commanding and myself to recommend prompt action should be taken to help Assyrians to save themselves fromtheir own folly and to reassure Iraq. Government that wewere not indifferent to the dangerous potentialities of anunchecked fanatical movement on the part of Assyrians whichmight retard realization of Iraq.&apos;s independence.      In other words we suggested small temporary reinforcements now inorder to minimise risk of large reinforcements being re-quired later.I shall do my utmost to procure withdrawal ofmanifesto and if this is impossible, to mitigate harmfuleffect of disbandment and national concentration by every means in my power.
IMMEDIATE,Private and Personal.Cabinet will consider your telegram No.205 tomorrow morning.(2)     Cabinet decision communicated in my No,151 contemplate-ted alternative of holding Assyrian levies under military disci-pline after disarmament.      They felt unable to sanction use ofBritish troops to hold levies either as disbanded men or as adisarmed force.      Either course would involve possibility of conflict between British troops and these levies, which Cabinetregarded as inadmissible.      They also considered practical difficulty of keeping men from drifting away as pointed out in personal telegram from C.A.S. to A.0.C      Moreover War Officeabsolutely refuse to contemplate dispersal of Battalion by companies as proposed.      Even if Cabinet ordered reinforcementsWar Office considered that one Battalion was quite inadequate.I did not refer to this in my telegram because matter was decided on grounds stated therein and this therefore did not arise.(3)     You know that Government alv/ays attach great weight to your views and I want to assure you that decision of cabinet was taken with full regard to your estimate of eventualities iflevies were permitted to join concentration;    and because cabinet felt that notwithstanding those risks,  they would not be justifiedin sending British troops.CYPHER TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the colonies to the High Commissioner of Iraq.,(Sent 9.50 p.m.  15th June, 1932.)
IMMEDIATE.Nos  152.    Secret.Cabinet have given prolonged consideration to yourtelegram No: 205.    Final decision will not be taken till wehave reply to this telegram.    Factors which Cabinet have toconsider are(a) health of troops(b) strategic(c) political.(a)    Health.    Unless War Office are satisfied that conditionsexist- which will effectively safeguard against serious risk ofheatstroke and ensure adequate medical treatment if cases arise,they cannot consent to despatch a Battalion from Egypt, which isonly Battalion which could be made available.    Points on whichthey want information as&apos; regards this are given in my immediately following telegram.(Is)    Strategic.    Military difficulties felt by War Office aregiven in my immediately following telegram also possiblemodifications which War Office think might reduce or avoid these difficulties as far as possible. Would War Office modificationsenable you to achieve the end in view? If not have you any alternative suggestions to overcome military difficulties? Inparticular, under suggested moflifications, could Battalioneffectively prevent men of levies whom you think it necessary tohold,  from joining concentration, or at any rate hold a sufficient number of such men to prevent concentration being effective? WeCYPHER TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the colonies to the High Commissioner of Iraq..(Sent 9.30 p.m.,  16th June.  1932) .
could certainly not contemplate despatch of a Battalion unlessyou are satisfied that use of that Battalion under conditionswhich War Office must attach will he effective for the purpose for which you require it.(c) Political.   You know Cabinet feel great political difficulties first in sending British troops to Iraq at all atpresent times and secondlys using British forces for purposeof coercing Assyrian levies.    Assuming conditions under (a) ana(b) can be satisifed Cabinet would only contemplate sending a battalion if it is the only means to avert the grave conse-quences you predict if Battalion not sent.    If a Battalion issent Cabinet are anxious as to possible developments; for example(l)    If levies resist disarmament or detention Britishtroops might become Involved in serious fighting with them;(2)    How could British troops in fact prevent them dispersing?(3)    If they attempt to escape 9 is it intended that Britishtroops should shoot down unarmed Assyrians?(4)    If they do not shoot, if necessary? how will increasingdispersal of levies be prevented?(5)    May not British Battalion be retained indefinitelybecause risk of concentration continues?(6)    Cabinet wish to be satisfied why It is impossible touse available Iraq troops to hold levies.Cabinet have considered possibility of sending re-inforcements from India.    This is (l) politically impossible(2) impracticable because re-inforcements could not arrive intime.Cabinet are impressed with importance of obtaining a fairsettlement of Assyrian political claims.    It would be infinitelypreferable to overcome difficulty by political means than by show
*4t cd L Jof force.      They feel this very important not only to relievepresent tension hut also as insurance of peace in future and toavoid possible repercussion in Geneva and risk of protractedmilitary commitments hereafter.What is latest date by which Battalion must arrive if your plan is approved?Private and Personal.      I am sure you will appreciate-that apart from difficulties, health, strategic, political, whichI have put to you, British forces are so reduced that it is really impossible to contemplate military re-inforcements on alarge scale now or in the future.     Moreover, I do not believethat even the National Government xzould carry Parliament and thecountry in approving serious military operations in Iraq..iii.
Immediate.    Secret.No.  153.See my immediately preceding telegram.    The following are points raised &quot;by the War Office s-(a) Medical.    In order to minimise the risk of heavy casualties from sickness with those unacclimatised troops5  themedical authorities consider the following general measuresessentials-X. The troops must he properly housed ins-(a)    Barracks with fans.(h)    Barracks9  if without fans, with other anti-heatmeasures.(c)    If not in barracks,  in double fly E.P.  tents.S. Adequate supply of fresh rations and suitable cookingarrangements.3. Means of sterilisation of water,  If not from approvedsource.4. Adequate supply of ice and minerals.5. Suitable clothing for day and night.6. Adequate means of ablution.7. Efficient sanitary arrangements with skilled supervision.8. Adequate medical arrangements.(b) Strategical.    The use of a battalion for the purposeproposed is regarded as militarily unsound9 more especially asit is tactically Immobile when transported by air, owing to lack of regimental vehicles.While we note your opinion that the   mere presenceof a British battalion will preserve calm and inspire confidence,CYPHER TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the colonies to the High Commissioner of Iraq..(Sent 11.SO p.m.,  16th June, 193S.)
we should like you to consider the situation that might developshould opposition he encountered from the Levies and a needfor shooting arise;    it might well he that the battalion,,possibly dispersed, would be in the centre of an area of unrestnorth of Baghdad.    If in addition the Marsh Arabs and otherpossibly disaffected tribes seize on the opportunity to make themselves obnoxious, we might see a repetition of the happeningsof 1920.    Not only would it then be Impossible to extricatethe battalion, but reinforcements on a large scale might be needed.    It is unnecessary to emphasize to you the lengths towhich reduction of units in the Army has gone; reinforcementscould only be despatched by recourse to mobilisation.    Thedespatch of another battalion by- air would gravely increase our commitments and aggravate the military situation for thereasons given above.    Should considerations of State demand the despatch of one battalion, we suggest that it should bekept concentrated as far as possible, as the tactical risksare obviously much greater if the battalion Is dispersed? but apart from this suggestion War Office do not intend to impose restrictions on its use which might tie the hands of the man onthe spot.Exposure to the sun during the heat of the day Isa fruitful source of sickness and we hope that this will beborne in mind in allotting the duties.
