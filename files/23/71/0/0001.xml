The Prime Minister made a verbal report onthe main results of the Anglo-French Conversationsheld on Monday,- April 4th, on the subject of a proposed Conference of Danubian States with a viewto some amelioration of the financial and economicsituation in Central -Europe (Appendix, 1) .In reply to questions  the Prime Minister addedthat all reports of any figure of financial assist-ance to the Danubian States, were incorrect.   TheUnited Kingdom representatives had reserved their decision, as he had reported at the end of hiss statement,The Prime Minister invited his colleagues to study his statement, which would be circulated withthe Minutes of the Meeting.
2. The. Cabinet- had before them the following documents relating to DisarmamentA Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-110(32)) containing a general summaryof the position at the DisarmamentConference:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (CP.-95(32))  on the question of disarmament and Sanctions: -A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Air (CP.-82 (32)) on air Disarmament and the Abolitionof Bombing Aircraft.The .?rime Minister informed the Cabinet that thequestion of Disarmament, and more especially theattitude to be taken up by the United Kingdom Delega-tion on the resumption of the Conference at geneva on April 11th, had been discussed by the CabinetCommittee on the previous afternoon.    Owing to thelate hour at which the Committee had adjourned andthe large amount of ground covered,  it had not beenpossible to circulate a Report in time for consider-ation by the Cabinet that morning.   He proposed to circulate the Minutes and Conclusions of theCommittee to the Cabinet as soon as possible, andhe would ask the Cabinet to consider it at their next Meeting.    If any modifications in the Conclusionsof the Committee were found by the Cabinet to benecessary they would have to be transmitted to theUnited Kingdom. Delegation by telegram.   As theCabinet Committee included ten members of the Cabinethe hoped that their views might commend themselvesto their colleagues.The Secretary of State for Air entered a caveatthat there was one point, arising out:of a Memorandumby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff circulatedby the Secretary of State for War to the disarmament committee,  on which he must reserve his opinion until he had seen the draft Minutes of the Committee,
THE IRISH FREE 3. The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsSTATE.  . handed round the reply of the Irish Free state the Oath and &apos;Appendix II)Land Annuities. Government, dated April 5, 1932,/to the despatchof the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsf Pr evi previous reference: dated March 83rd, on the subjects of the Oath and cabinet 19(32), Con- Land Annuities.   He pointed out that severalelusion 13.)fA.questions arose for decision,  including the date of publication of this despatch and his ov;n despatchof March 23rd:    the statement in paragraph 5 of thedespatch under consideration&apos;that it was theintention of the Irish Free State Government,immediately on the reassembly of Parliament, tointroduce a Bill for the removal of Article 17 ofthe&apos; Constitution,  and for such consequential changesas may be required to make the removal effective:and paragraph 6, dealing with the land Annuities.He suggested, that the Cabinet Committee should meetas soon as could be arranged consistently with the many engagements of Ministers during the present weekHe proposed to send a message to the Irish FreeState Government to the effect that the UnitedKingdom Government would consider the despatch andreply later, adding such proposals as to publicationas the Cabinet might approve.   Pending the meetingof the Cabinet Committee, Officials of the dominions office were in consultation with the Attorney-general with a view to the preparation of a draft reply.He intended to reply to a Private Hot ice question by the Leader of the Opposition in the House ofCommons by stating that the despatch had been,received and was under consideration.On the question of publication it was notedthat the despatch of the Irish Free State Governmentwas a political manifesto addressed to Irishmen
all over the world more than a reply to thedespatch of the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs .    The qu.estion of its publication before that of our rejoinder therefore required carefulc ons iderat ion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Cabinet Committee should meet on the following evening,Thursday, April 7th, at 9 p.m., inthe Prime Minister&apos;s Room at theHouse of Commons, to consider thequestion of the publication of thedespatch of the Irish Free StateGovernment, and the reply to be madethereto:(b) That- the Attorney-General should beinvited to attend the above meeting.
surs4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs:reported that at the moment there was no questionconnected with the Far East on which he desiredto consult the Cabinet.
1 1 nIfllNE. 5*    Tlie Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by *-Inment the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 11 5 ,Hy *1 . and C.P. 1 2if. (j52))* raising two questions of policyPiOUS affecting Palestine on which he desired a decisionSrence:Jnat 2if by the Government, viz:-), Con-ision 7). (1) The setting up of a LegislativeCouncil.(2) Jewish immigration.I &apos; Details were included of the history of both these1Ij^S^lv. questions, as well as the views of the High commissioner and the Secretary of State&apos;s own advice.After discussion the Cabinet agreed;-(a) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows:-The Secretary of State for theColonies (in the Chair),The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of Labour,The First Commissioner of Works,should meet to consider the question of setting up a Legislative Council!(b) To approve the policy on jewish immigration proposed by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, namely,to maintain strictly the principle ofabsorptive capacity;    to leave thefinal determination of facts relative to its application entirely in thehands of the High Commissioner and hisofficials acting under his direction;to encourage, as far as possible,co-operation between the PalestineExecutive of the Jewish Agency and thePalestine Government in regard toJewish immigration; and to continue,so far as the means of Palestine permit,the improvement in the machinery for determing factors necessary for theproper application of the principle ofabsorptive capacity.NOTE:- It was arranged that thePalestine Committee should meet on Tuesday next, April 12th,at 11.0 a.m., in the Secretary ofState&apos;s Room at the ColonialOffice.
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP.-120 (32)) on the subject of theKowelt Oil Concession.In 1913 the Sheikh of Koweit, an independentruler under British protection, gave an undertaking to grant no oil concession without His majesty&apos;s government&apos;s consent.    In 1925 the Eastern andGeneral Syndicate, a British concern, secured theconsent of the Colonial Office to their negotiating with the Sheikh for an oil concession, no stipula-tion as to a British nationality clause being madewith this consent.    In 19 30 the Syndicate, afterdiscussions with the Sheikh, approached His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with a draft oil concession which theyhad made arrangements to transfer, if obtained, to american interests.    They were then informed by theColonial Office that any concession granted mustcontain a British nationality clause.   The UnitedStates Government were urging that American interestsshould have equal opportunities with B?oitish interestsand were pressing for a reply.   The Secretary ofState&apos;s view, from which the India Office and. the petroleum Department did not dissent, was statedas follows:-The Foreign Office have taken theview that a dog-in-the-manger attitude would be indefensible both vis-a-visof the Americans and from the stand-point of the obligation of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to consult the Sheikh&apos;s best interests.    If the Anglo-Persian oil company put forward a satisfactoryoffer for a concession, well and good&apos;if they do not, His Majesty&apos;s Government-should not prevent the Sheikh fromallowing any concession which he may give to be transferred to United Statesinterests,  if he wishes.    In thesecircumstances the Foreign Office feelthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should meet the United States governments views to the extent of replying toMr Atherton that they will not insist on the inclusion of a clause confiningit to British interests, but that it-7-
will naturally be necessary thatany applications for a concessions which may be forthcoming should be examined to see which   if any, would best serve the Sheikh/s interests.It is proposed, also,  to add that, inany case, on many points,  including those designed to safeguard theinterests of His MajestyTs Governmentand the Sheikh, the draft concessionsubmitted by the Eastern and GeneralSyndicate would need revision.The Petroleum Department, in agreeing, quotedthe following policy approved by the Committee ofImperial Defence and approved in principle by thelate Government, subject to discussion at theImperial Conference, viz.(l) Foreign capital only to be admittedin cases where foreigners are citizens of countries granting similar advantages to British nationals .(S) The company to be registered in british territory.(3) The majority of the employees and atleast some of the directors, including,if possible, the local Managing Director,to be British subjects.(4) At least 50 per cent, of the oilobtained to be refined on british territory, and the plant to be capable of producing fuel oil,suitable for Admiralty use.(5) His Majesty&apos;s Government to retain the right of pre-emption in case ofemer eency .The Admiralty, however,  it was stated in theMemorandum, argued that - (a) great difficulties would arise from the obligation to protect UnitedStates interests on the mainland of Arabia; (b) itis essential to control any oil production inKoweit, as being particularly favourably situatedfrom, the Admiralty point of view.   They therefore proposed that any oil concession in respect ofKoweit should contain, besides the five conditions laid down under the Petroleum Department^ policyreferred to above, a stipulation that over 50 percent, of the capital should be British.    This,
according to the Memorandum, would amount to theapplication of the old policy    of absolute british control that had preceded the policy approved bythe Committee of Imperial Defence.The Air Ministry supported the Admiralty generally in desiring the maintenance of British control.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed theCabinet that, as the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was prepared to accept the conditions laiddown by the Committee of Imperial Defence, theAdmiralty would withdraw their insistence on morethan 50 per cent, of the capital being British.The Secretary of State for Air associated himself with the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Cabinet felt that, before a final decision was taken,  it would be advisable to ascertain theattitude of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company towardsthe question.   They therefore agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take immediate steps to Ascertain throxigh Sir JohnOadman the position of the Anglo-PerSiah Oil Company towards this&apos;question:(b) That, unless as the result of theabove consultation new considerations were raised which led him to alterhis view or to desire to consult theCabinet again, he should be authorised(as suggested in par a. 5 of CP.-120 (32))to meet&quot;the United States Government&apos;views to the extent of replying toMr Atherton that they will not insist on the inclusion in any concession of a clause confining it to Britishinterests^ but that it will naturally be necessary that any applications fora concession which may be forthcomingshould be examined to see what, if any,would best serve the Sheikh&apos;s interests.
NATIONAL HEALTH 7. The Cabinet had before them the followingAND CONTRIBU-TORY PENSIONS     .   document relating to National Health and Contribu-INSURANC E.tory Pensions Insurance:-(Previous A Memorandum by the Minister of Health&quot;Reference: (CP.-118 (32)) recalling an earlierCabinet 16 intimation that it would probably be(32), Con- necessary to introduce a Bill onelusion 7*) National Health Insurance owing to theserious effect on the finances&quot;of approved Societies resulting from(a) very heavy.expenditure on sickness and disablement benefits of women,particularly married women, and(b) very serious loss of contribution income by reason of unemployment.The Approved Societies were pressing for immediate remedial legislation,and the opportunity of such legislation could be taken to deal with the questionof prolongation of Insurance, nowdepending on a temporary enactmentfor the period ending 31st december next.As regards women&apos;s contributions and benefits, after setting forth allthe considerations involved, theMinister of Health advised that therates of benefit for women should befixed as follows:-Single Women Sickness Benefit 12s. a week (present rate 12s ,)Disablement:   ..      6s. a week (present rate 7s. 6d.)Married Women Sickness Benefit 10s. a week (present rate 12s .)Disablement    ..     5s . a week (present rate 7s.6d.)Maternity Benefit to remain at  2 in each case.As regards the effect of unemploymenton National Health Insurance,  the Minister,with great reluctance, had come to theconclusion that arrears due to unemploy-ment could no longer be completelyexcused.   He proposed, accordingly, thatthey should in future be excused onlyto the extent of one-half, so thatone-half the cost would be borne onthe funds of the Societies and theremaining half by the individual insured person himself.   This would involveeither the making by the insured person of a moderate cash payment of a fewshillings to be paid over four months to redeem his arrears, or a correspond-Ing reduction of his rate of benefit for the ensuing year. (Para, 19.)
In order to assist Societies tomeet their share of the coat (about 1,000,000 a year) it was proposedthat any Society which,  on valuation,was found to be threatened with a deficiency as a result of this proposal should be entitled to relief out of theCentral Fund,  into which, in order toassist in meeting this additionalliability, the unclaimed money fromthe sale of insurance stamps would bepaid.   This proposal was a matter ofgreat urgency, as a new contributionyear would begin in July and it wasnecessary that, well in advance of thatdate, the Approved Societies should bein a position to notify their membersof the new provisions.As regards  the question of continuanceof insurance, the Minister recalled thatin November last the Cabinet had decidedto provide for further prolongation of insurance until the end of the presentyear, at a cost to the Exchequer ofabout  110,000, as a purely temporary measure pending reconsideration of thewhole question in the light of theSecond Report of the Royal Commissionon Unemployment Insurance.    The Ministeradvised, however, that as amendingHealth Insurance legislation must beintroduced at once to deal with theproblem of women&apos;s insurance and arrears,it was desirable to deal at the sametime with the problem of duration of insurance and to put the scheme on a proper footing in this respect ratherthan to wait for the Report of theRoyal Commission, which, he thought,was unlikely to &quot;bear on the subject.(Para,35.)The Minister proposed, as regardsthose unemployed persons who are dueto go out of insurance at the 31stDecember next, that they shotxld becontinued in the insurance scheme forone further year to 31st December, 19 33,and be entitled to Medical Benefitduring that year (together with allpension rights) and, thereafter, if aman should die within one year ofceasing to be insured, his widowshould remain entitled to her pension  that is to say, the genuinely unemployedman would have a free period of HealthInsurance for a minimum of 3^ to 4 years,and for widow&apos;s pension of between 4^and 5 years. (Para.27.)The remaining proposals are stated inthe Memorandum as follows:-
After December, 1933, the permanentprovisions of the 1928 Act would apply?i.e*   continuance of insurance statusfor 2-f years on average) with the pro-vision that the title to widow&apos;s pension would always persist for one year afterthe cessation from Health Insurance(i.e..3x years on average in all).It is proposed that the cost ofprolongation for the year 1933, sofar as regards Health Insurance, shouldbe borne on National Health insurance funds generally through an adjustment ofthe transfer values which are carried tothe Reserve Suspense Fund on the cessation of insurance.The cost of the two years extensionfor Pensions during the first period ofthe operation of the Scheme, and oneyearTs extension thereafter, would fall upon the Pensions Fund, and would,pro tanto, increase the liability ofthe Exchequer under that Scheme.As a further and very attractiveconcession I would propose that in thecase of re-entry to employment and insurance within a certain time the qualifying conditions for widowspensions should be the lapse of 26weeks, and the payment of 26 contri-btitions, after re-entry, instead of104 weeks and the payment of 104 contri-butions as at present.The Minister of Health invited theconcurrence of his colleagues in the intro-duction of legislation on the above lines as soon as possible after the re-assemblingof Parliament.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that,on receipt of the Minister of Health&apos;s Memorandum,he had felt it necessary to summon advisers from scotland.    He had intended to circulate a Memo-randum, but the Minister of Health&apos;s Paper had notbeen received in time to enable this to be done.He then made, at some length, a statement to theCabinet, in which he accepted, the proposals asregards Married Women, though&apos; realising that itentailed financial risk;      but criticised an3 madealternative suggestions on various parts of theMinister of Health&apos;s proposals.
The First Lord of the Admiralty stated thatthere was a point in connection with Widows which affected the three Services,The Minister of Health stated that he knew the .point and was prepared to roee-t it. .Several details of the proposals were criticised by members of the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  fa) To approve the proposals of theMinister of Health as to Women&apos;sContributions and Benefits andArrears - of Contributions due to unemployment:(b) That the Minister of Health shouldbe authorised to inform the approved societies Consultative Committeeof the intentions of the Governmenton the above questions;(c) That the remaining questions raised in the Minister of Health&apos;s Memo-randum (CP.-11.8 (32)) should bereferred for consideration by aCabinet Committee composed asfollows:-The Minister of Health (in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer(or a representative),The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Labour.It was agreed that Ministers shouldbe permitted to be accompanied by parliamentary Under-Secretaries, ifthey should so desire.

6? 6a)SWEEPSTAKES 9.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byMl) LOTTERIES .the Home Secretary (C,P,-121 (32&apos;)) recalling thatprevious at the Meeting referred to in the margin the cabinet reference:[^Cabinet 16 had decided that there was no alternative but to\ 132) , Oon-Ifjlusion 9.) allow the existing situation as to sweepstakes andlotteries to continue.   Attention was also drawn tothe following new factors:-   the public knowledge that the present law could not be enforced in thecase of the Irish Sweepstakes&apos;    the recent vote inthe House of Commons on the First Reading ofSir William Davison&apos;s Bill and the probability thatthe Government will be asked what their policy ison the matter?    that the Racecourse Betting control board is perturbed about  its financial position andthat the question of the introduction of an amending bill has been raised to extend the operations &apos;of the Board from horse-races, which have not provedremunerative, to greyhound races&apos;    and       the relaxation of the Police measures to control streetbetting, which the Commissioner of the MetropolitanPolice has found it necessary to relax in order thithe Police should be able to give more effectiveattention to other important matters .    In view ofthese- considerations the Secretary of State suggested the desirability of a Royal Commission to investigate the question of Sweepstakes and Lotteries and othercognate subjects .The Cabinet approved the above proposal.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 6,  1932.
GENERAL RESULTS OF THE ANGLO-FRENCH CONVERSATIONSHELD ON MONDAY, APRIL 4th,  1932.(Statement made by the Prime Minister to the Cabineton Wednesday, April 6th,  1932,  (Cabinet 20 (J2),Conclusion 2)).1.    In the first instance it would be desirableto limit the Conference to the following fiveS tates ; -AUSTRIAHUNGARYJUGO-SLAVIACZECHO-SLOVAKIAROUMANIA,a:nd to indicate that something might be done forBULGARIA later on..2.    The invitation to the above States should contain a suggestion that the Governments concerned should consider favourably the following;-(a) A general lowering of tariffs inter se,which would most speedily be attained by the method of percentage reduction,such reduction to be not less than 10per cent, in any class of goods..(b) A removal between the Danubian Statesof other economic barriers, such asprohibitions,  quotas, and the like.(c) It goes without saying that the closereconomic relations of the DanubianStates cannot Oe brought about by the raising of their tariffs against othercountries. &apos;3.    In order to assist the recovery of the danubian States it may be necessary to contemplate the granting of unilateral preferences to Danubianproducts by outside States, but it should be clearly understood that these outside States should not secure for themselves in return preferential treatment of their products when imported into the danubian area.APPENDIX    I.
PACT BETWEEN k-.    There was general agreement that a Nine-Power[TING powers TaE DANUBIAN-     Conference should be avoided, but that it wasIs.necessary to preserve contact between the InvitingPowers and the Powers concerned in the Conference.The following means were favoured for securing thiscontact:(i) A neutral Chairman, provided this couldbe arranged.(ii) The appointment of a Committee by theInviting Powers to keep in touch withthe Conference.(iii) This Committee not to sit in the sametown as  that in which the conference was held, but somewhere in the vicinity:e.g.,  the Conference at Lausanne andthe Committee at Geneva.5.   As regards the recent Report of the FinancialCommittee of the League of Nations on States in eastern Europe, both Governments favoured thefollowing procedure:-(1) A Committee of Treasury Experts to beappointed before the Meeting of theCouncil;(2) A report of the appointment of thisCommittee to be made to the Council;(3) A hope that the Council would notdispose of the Report of the FinancialCommittee until it had received theReport of the Treasury Experts.It was proposed to appoint the Treasury committee at an early session of the Four-Power Conference.6.    M. Tardieu and M. Flandin pressed for financialassistance for the countries concerned, but the british representatives reserved their decision until afterthe Treasury Committee had reported on the stipula- &apos;tions and conditions to be attached to such assistancein order to ensure the recovery of the Danubian States.
APPENDIX_IIReply of. the Irish Free State Government,to the despatch of the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs, dated March 23, 1932*Department of External Affairs,Irish Free State.5th April, 1932.Despatch Ms.  59.Sir?The Government ofthe Irish Free State has had under consideration the views of the British Governmentcommunicated to me in your Despatch No.  69 of March 23rd.2. Whether the Oath was or was not &quot;an integral part of the Treaty made ten years ago&quot; is not now theissue.      The real issue is that the Oath is an intolerable&quot;burden to the people ftf this State and that they have declared in the most formal manner that they desire itsinstant removal.3. The  suggestion in your Despatch that theGovernment of the Irish Free State contemplates actingdishcnourahly cannot in justice Toe let pass.      The pagesof the history - of the relations between Great Britainand Ireland are indeed stained by many &quot;breaches of faith, but I must remind you the guilty party has notbeen Ireland.4. In justice also I must point out that the observance of t he agreement e?f 1921 has involved noparity of sacrifice as between Great- Britain and Ireland.This agreement ga^e effect to what was the will of the
British Government *      It was       the other hand directly-opposed to the will of the Irish people and was submitted to by them only under the threat of immediate and terrible war.      Since it was signed it has costBritain nothing.      In fact Britain&apos;s prestige throughoutthe world has been considerably enhanced lay the belief,carefully fostered, that Ireland had at last &quot;been set free and the national aspiration of her people fullysatisfied.     For Ireland, however, this agreement hasmeant the consummation of the outrage of Partition,and the alienation of the most sacred part of our national territory with all the cultural and materialloss that this unnatural separation entails.British maintenance parties are still inoccupation in some of our principal ports, even in thearea of the Free State      Oxtr coastal defence is stillretained in British hands.     Britain claims the right in times of war or strained relations with a foreign power to make demands upon Ireland which if granted willmake our right to neutrality a mockery.This agreement divided the people of Irelandinto two hostile camps, those who deemed it a duty to resist, facing the consequences, and those who deemed itprudent in the national interest temporarily to submit,the latter being placed in the no less cruel position of having apparently to hold Ireland for England with &quot;an economy of English lives&quot;, to quote from the lateLsrd Birkeiihead&apos; s famous exposition of the policy inthe House of LordSo.To England this agreement gave, peace and a ddedprestige.      In Ireland it raised brother&apos;s hand a gainst&quot;trsther, gave us ten years ef blood and tears and
&quot;besmirched the name of Ireland whenever a foul propagandahas been able to misrepresent us.During these ten years, moreover, there has beenextracted from us, though in part only as a consequenceof the agreement, a financial tribute which, relativelyto population, puts a greater burden on the people of theIrish Free State than the burden of the war reparation payments on the people of Germany, and, relatively totaxable capacity, a burden ten times as heavy as theburden on the people of Britain of their &quot;ftetit payments to the United States of America,,5. But as I have already indicated we are dealingat the moment with the much narrower issue, whether anoath is or is not to be imposed on members elected to sit in the Parliament of the Free State.     TheGovernment of the Irish Free State must maintain that thisis a matter of purely domestic concern.
