ABINBTSoEDURE.iirculation!f: I Memo rand a^previous[Reference:llbinet 9B3), Con-ttusion 11*)1.     The Prime Minister drew attention to thefact that two Papers,  including an important Reportby a Cabinet Committee, had only been circulatedvery late on the previous evening, so that ministers had not had time to study them properly.    In theinterests of Cabinet business he asked his colleagues to do their utmost to comply with the rules of theCabinet and to circulate documents1 in. time for their proper study.   Meetings of Cabinet Committees should,so far as possible, be arranged sufficiently early to enable this to be done.
yri, CONCESSIONS 2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatKOWEIT. .    ,on the morning of Saturday, April 9th, he hadPrevious received a telephonic communication from the^Reference:Cabinet 20 Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informing(c2). Con-delusion 6.) him that he had not liked to hold over his replyto Mr Atherton on the question of the oil conees-sions at Eoweit until Sir John 0adman had been consulted.    Re himself had not liked the idea ofacting contrary to the Cabinet decision,   He hadll understood that the Treasury had been consulted and in the circumstances had no objection.In the course of the discussion it transpired that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had notobjected to an alteration in the procedure approvedby Cabinet decision because he had been informedthat the Prime Minister had concurred.1&apos;&apos;I The Prime Minister explained that the notificationmade to Mr Atherton did not imply any support to theAmerican Company whether of a positive or a negativecharacter, and that the concession was limited tofthe non-insistence on the inclusion m any concession of a clause confining it to British interests:    thatis to say, that if the American Company receivedthe concession it would not be deprived of it on theground that it was an American Company.^he subject was then adjourned for a short timewhile enquiry was made as to whether the ForeignOffice had as yet ascertained the views of Sir John0adman.Later in the Meeting the Prime Minister said he was informed that there was no record in theForeign Office of any approach having, been madeto Sir John Cadman.    He was informed that a letter
had been received on April 10th at 10, downing street, dated Friday, April 8th, but he had hadno opportunity to deal with it, and the first hehad heard of the matter was on Saturday, April 9th.The Prime Minister said he would see thePermanent Under-^Secretary of State, Foreign Office,the same day on the question,  and he undertook then to ascertain whether it might not be advisable forthe Treasury to see Sir John 0adman.(NOTE.    Information was received afterthe Cabinet that an official of the Foreign Office had. seenSir John Cadman on Monday,April 11th   and Sir John had stated that he had no objectionto the prooo^urc propoa^id ,) -
RMAMBNTbviousTerence:Hbinet 30Wk), Con-jmsion 2.)ft..mm.3.The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Disarmament Conference:-(i) On the Attittide to be adopted bythe United Kingdom Delegation onthe General Commission of theDisarmament Conference.Second Conclusions of theCabinet Committee (CP ,-119 (32)).A Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs(CP,-125 (32)) ,(ii) Proposed Restrictions on Bombingfrom the Air.A Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for India (C,P,-126 (32)).A memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Air (CfP.-127 (32)).The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested an amendment to the Conclusions of the CabinetCommittee (C.P.-119 (32)) on the subject of budgetary Limitation.   This was adopted in a slightly amended form (gee. Conclusion (a) below) .The Prime Minister pointed out that the events of the last two days had introduced considerableconfusion into the question of Disarmament,M. Tardieu had made a speech at Geneva which had brought the whole discussion on to new lines byattacking both the American and the British thesis.A Press telegram received that morning indicated that Signor Grandi was giving full support toMr- Gibson&apos;s proposals.    On the whole, however, theseevents bore out the wisdom of the Committee&apos;suggestion that it was impossible to foresee in what circumstances particular questions might arise,what opportunities might present themselves foruseful intervention by the United Kingdom Delega-tion, and that a wide latitude must,be left tothem (CP.-119 (32), p.12) .
The Prime Minister drew attention to the factthat since the Cabinet Committee had met, furtherPapers had been circulated on the subject of restric-tions  on bombing from the air.   The Air Ministry-were very firm in their objections to the Conclusionsof the^ Cabinet Committee.    He felt that in the new situation it was impossible for the Cabinet to decidethis question and that the best plan would be toremit it to the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva,which could consider it at Geneva in the atmosphere of the International Conference.He hoped himself to proceed to Geneva after theas possibleBudget Speech, and he would like as many/of hiscolleagues on the United Kingdom Delegation to be atGeneva during the week-end Saturday April 23 / Sunday-April 24, for purposes of consiiltation.The raising of the question of bombing led to a discussion on the wide differences of opinion betweenthe Services on this and some other questions, theresults of which are recorded in the Conclusion which follows .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Conclusions of the ministerial committee (D,C.(M)(32)  2nd. Conclusions(g)  on pp.12 and 14)  on the subject of budgetary Limitation should be amended to read as follows:-^&quot;On the question of Budgetary Limit-ation the Committee agreed thatthis form, of limitation presentedgreat practical difficulties inapplication.    In view, however, ofthe possible misrepresentation ofan attitude of hostility, theCommittee agreed that the UnitedKingdom Delegation should not present a blank negative, but should, be given discretion as to how they deal with this matter whenthe discussions arise at Geneva&quot;.(b) That the question of proposed restric-tions on bombing from the air should, be remitted to the United Kingdom delegation at Geneva;
To take note that the Prime minister would circulate to the Delegation alist of the arrangements for a rosterof Ministers at Geneva during thenext few weeks:That as many members of the UnitedKingdom Delegation as possible should be present at Geneva onApril 23/24, during the PrimeMinister&apos;s visit, for purposes of consultation.
Hdefence 4. In the course of the discussion referred toSticks.IL in the preceding Conclusion the attention of theOrdinationCabinet was drawn to the wide differences of technical opinion existing between the Staffs of^($tyl&amp;tX,   the Alv Ministry, on the one hand, and of theAdmiralty and War Office, on the other, on questionsof high strategy in which the Air Force was concerned,as illustrated by the question of bombing.The Prime Minister said that for some time he had felt that it was very important to try and secure some closer co-operation between the Services.On questions where the differences were acute theChiefs of Staff Committee had not proved a solvent, andhe suggested that progress might be made by the holding of a Conference, or the formation of aCommittee composed of the three Service ministers and their respective Chiefs of Staff,  to try andhammer out some measure of agreement.    He himself would be glad to take the Chair.   What he wished to -arrive at was the idea and spirit of a Ministry ofDefence without the actual creation of such a&quot;Ministry, to which he had been opposed.    after making this proposal he added that he had just been reminded by the Secretary that an organisationof this kind was created in 1912 in consequenceof differences of strategical principle betweenthe Admiralty and War Office that had manifestedthemselves during the Agadir crisis of 1911.   this organisation had been known at the time as the&quot;High Level Bridge&quot;, and had done much to securethe co-ordination between the Services which existedat the outbreak of the War..He invited the Ministers at&apos; the head of the .Defence Services to prepare the way for collaboration
3Gof the kind he had indicated.   He himself would takeinitiative in the matter as soon as an opportunity-presented itself.The Prime Minister&apos;s proposal met with the warm approval of the Cabinet.
IlNAL HEALTH 5* The Cabinet had before them the Report oflONTRlBUTORY -KoNS INSUR-   the Cabinet Committee appointed at the Meeting5*referred to in the margin on the subject ofllious National Health and Contributory Pensions Insurancellrence:friet SO (CP.-129 (32)) TheI, Con-i^ion 7.) Committee, by a majority, recommended to the Cabinet11 the adoption of the Minister of Health&apos;s proposalsBH^&quot;^&quot;&apos; as set 0-ut in paragraph 3 of CP.  129 (32).    TheHome Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland? however, were unable to concur fully with the remainder of the Committee, and the Secretaryof State for Scotland entered a reservation to theeffect that the scheme submitted by the Minister ofHealth failed to make adequate provision forpreserving medical benefit&apos;and pension rights(especially the latter),    He gave instances of the hardship inflicted on a person who had paid hiscontributions and had been in insurance for long periods and who was available for, but unable to-ob t a in, emp 1 oym e n t.The above Memorandum had only been circulatedlate on the previous evening.      In the circumstances-the discussion at the Cabinet was only of a preliminary, character.The Minister of Health undertook to circulatesome further particulars that were asked for, as to possible means by which men who had for a longterm of years made contributions and been ininsurance, but were in danger of losing pension rights, might be enabled to retain those rights.The Prime Minister asked that the ministers concerned - should exchange views with the object
of finding some agreed solution.The Cabinet agreed  To postpone the question untilthe next regular meeting ofthe Cabinet.-10-
rriHE IRISHFREE STATE(previous reference:Cabinet 20(32),  Oon-clusion 3,)6.   The Cabinet took note of a Despatch fromthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tothe Minister for External Affairs, Irish FreeState, circulated with a covering Note by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (C.P.-123(32)).    In this Note it was explained that theDespatch was in a form approved by the irish situation Committee at a meeting on April 7th.The Home Secretary reported that thePrime Minister of Northern Ireland wasarriving in London the same afternoon, andwould see the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and himself.-11 -

The owners(32),  Son-elusion 4.)    had been persuaded to meet the men on April 7th.The proceedings had been adjourned to enable theparties to report to their respective Executives,and no date was fixed for a further meeting.    Theowners were not prepared to discuss any form of wagesguarantee whatever, and the men would certainly not agree to a continuance of the 7^hours day for aperiod (which is the most they are likely to accept)without some measure of protection for wages.    Itwould probably be necessary for the President ofthe Board of Trade to summon both sides to meet himshortly.In the course of a short discussion thePrime Minister urged strongly that it should be made clear to both parties in this controversy that theGovernment intended to enlighten public opinion onthe facts of the situation.The President of the Board of Trade said that neither party wanted publicity, but he had alreadyintimated to them that the Government would have to appeal to public opinion and issue communiquesfrom time to time.The Cabinet agreed --That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The President of the Board ofTrade (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for theColonies,The Lord Privy Seal,The President of the Board ofEducation,should be appointed to&apos; assist thePresident of the Board of Trade indealing with the Coal Situation.

The Foreign secretary was prepared to accept the views of the Treasury on whether this question should be raised at the next meeting of the Council.       Notice of this would haveto be given by next Monday, and the Chancellor of theExchequer had thought it advisable, before taking action,  to consult the Cabinet.In the course of a short discussion theChancellor of the Exchequer said he thought thatthe best plan would be to appoint an international committee of experts to review the expenditure andthe financial methods of the League.      He hoped thatthe result would be a percentage cut and a reduction. .in the staff,      It was further suggested that sucha Committee might include in its review the failureof certain States to pay their contributions tothe League of Nations, and above all the question ofestablishing some form of financial control over theLeague&apos; s expenditure, comparable with that exercised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury.It was urged that the International Labour office should be included in the review.The Cabinet approved&apos; the proposal of the Chancellor    of the exchequer that the question should be raised at the   Council  at Geneva, andlaid stress on the words underlinedabove.
