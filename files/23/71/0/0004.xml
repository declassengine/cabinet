IMPORT DUTIESCT (1932) .First Reportof theAdvisoryCommittee.List of Pro-posed Duties .(previous reference:Cabinet 15(32), Oon-clusion 15.)FA.1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer read to theCabinet a summary, prepared in the Treasury, of along Report which he had received from the AdvisoryCommittee set up under the Import Duties Act.   he added that the Schedules contained a very long listof articles to be subjected to Duties proposed inthe Report.   His proposal was that the Report ofthe Committee and the Orders imposing the Dutiesrecommended therein should be published on Fridaynext, April 22nd, that the Duties should come intooperation on Tuesday, April 26th, and that theParliamentary Resolution necessary to confirm theOrders should be introduced as soon as possible.In reply to various questions, the Chancellorof the Excheqiier said that Sir William May, Chairmanof the Committee, with whom he had had a conversationafter the Report had been completed, had indicated that one of the intentions of the Committee in recommending the Duties was to stimulate there-organisation of various industries, beginning with the Iron and Steel industry.    Parliament couldreject, but not amend, the Duties included in theOrdei0,In the course of the discxission it was pointedout that this long Schedule of proposed Duties hadbeen completed by the Committee in a very shortspace of time.    There could have been no examinationof particular items comparable with that undertaken,for example, under the Safeguarding of industries procedure.   The Cabinet had not as yet seen theReport as a whole, or the Schedules.   The cabinet were reminded, however, that the Advisory Committee ,had been set up in order to remove the examinationof this question from political influence, and the
general understanding had been that, in the absenceof over-riding circumstances, the Government would act on the recommendations.The Chancellor of the exchequer was preparedto circulate the Report and Schedules to theCabinet in advance of publication.In the circumstances, it was felt that theReport must be accompanied by the Government&apos;decision for implementing it.The Cabinet were informed &apos;that GovernmentDepartments had nothing to do with the compilationof the Report except to fMrnish information requiredby the Committee, which had been left, as had been intended, to exercise its judgment unfettered.Some discussion took place as to the date onwhich the necessary Resolution should be introduced in Parliament, and on this aspect of the question the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury wasconsulted.CABINET &apos; There was  general agreement that this questionPROCEDUREwas covered by the Cabinet decision of January 32,(Previous 1932^ referred to in the margin.Reference:Cabinet 7(32), Con- Subject to the last paragraph above, theclus ion 1,)Cabinet agreed(a) ^hat the Report of the AdvisoryCommittee under the Import DiztiesAct (1932) should be published on&quot;Friday, April 22nd:(b) That the Orders imposing the Dutiesrecommended by the Advisory Commit-- tee should be published on the same date and should come into effect on tuesday, April 26th:(c) That the Debate in Parliament onthe Resolution should take placeon Tuesday, April 28th,  and Wednesday,April 27th, and that the BudgetResolutions should be discussed onMonday, April 25th,  and Thursday.April 28th,
mHE CHILDREN 2,    The Cabinet had before them a memorandum and YOUNGPERSONS BILL. by the Home Secretary (C.P.-135 (32))  covering aMemorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary,(previous reference: Home Office, who is in charge of the Children and cabinet 8(32),  Con- Young Persons Bill, asking for instructions as toelusion 3(e).)the line which he should take in dealing with an amendment to the Bill which has been put down byLady Astor and is supported by Members of all parties, proposing that Local Authorities shotildbe empowered to deal by means of by-laws with theconditions of employment of young persons between14 and 18 in the so-called unregulated occupations.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary pointed out thatthere were two possible courses:-(i) ^o oppose the new Clause in Committee,and. if, as was probable, the Governmentwas defeated&apos;in Committee, to trust tothe deletion of the offending Clauseon the Report Stage:&quot;(ii)  I could oppose the inclusion of theproposals  in this Bill and at this time, but give on behalf of the Govern-ment an assurance of sympathy withthe principle and sincere intentionto proceed with the proposals as soonas opportunity offered.    To be success-iful I should probably have to go asfar as pledging the Government to theintroduction of a measure as soon asthe industrial situation improved.It will be remembered, that beforethe crisis such a pledge had beengiven on behalf of both the Conserva-tive and Labour Parties&quot;,He did not propose to use this latter authority: . &apos;unless satisfied that it would be effective, buthe wished to have an assurance, if he did use it,that the pledge would in fact be implemented at theearliest possible moment.After discussion, the Cabinet agreedTo authorise the Parliamentary Under-Secr-etary, Home Office, to adopt thecourse set forth in alternative (ii)above, and,  if necessary, to go asfar as pledging the Government to theintroduction of a measure-as soon as* Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,        the industrial situation improved.April 19,  1932.
