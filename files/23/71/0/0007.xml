REPARATIONS. 1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatmfte forthcoming there had been a certain amount of exchange of viewsConference.recently at Geneva on the subject of the Lausanne(previous reference:       Conference, and in his view it had become essentialCabinet 87(31), Con-&apos;     that the Cabinet should take decisions as to itselusion 2.)policy within the next fortnight.   Their representa-Xf(b\)^- tives at Geneva might at any time be consulted onthe question by representatives of other Powers.At Geneva he had gathered that the American pointof view might be summed up as follows:-    (l) Nosympathy with cancellation of reparations and war debts.    (2) An attempt to devise a scheme for thecommercialisation of reparations; that ia to say, thelinking up of the payments with German industry.The underlying idea was not to penalise Germany but rather to place her on a basis of equality withother Powers, and not to impose too heavy a burden.He himself had pointed out the impossibility of imposing the payments only on German railways.(3) Avoidance, above all,  of any linking up of war debts with reparations .    If some such scheme couldbe devised he thought there was a good chance of theUnited States proving sympathetic .   What theyespecially objected to was the idea of passing thewhole burden on to America.The Secretary of State for foreign affairs recalled that as a result of the conversations atGeneva he had drafted a number of questions, intended,to concentrate the discussion.   He had receivedsuggestions from, the Prime Minister and the Treasury,and. would circulate a revised draft to whateverCommittee was appointed, with a view to focussingthe discussion.
The Prime Minister recalled that the originalCabinet Committee on Reparations was appointed onDecember 10,1931, with instructions to consider andreport to the Cabinet on British Policy regardingInternational Financial Operations .    Since that timeseveral Ministers besides the members of that committee had become closely concerned, in reparations .He himself had hoped to take the Chair at the CabinetCommittee, but owing to the necessity of undergoingan operation to his eyes this was now impracticable.The Cabinet agreed  That the Cabinet Committee on reparations and related questions should be re-constituted aa followsThe Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for India,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(or representative),and should advise the Cabinet as tothe policy to be adopted at the lausanne Conference, if possilbe within a fortnight.
DISARMAMENT-. 2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that air Policy. the question of Air Disarmament had now come up atGeneva and the Cabinet must take a decision withinf previous reference: the next ten days as to what their policy was to be.Cabinet 21(32). Con- The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairselusion 3.)strongly reinforced what the Prime Minister had. said,as to the urgency of a decision.   The United Kingdom.I Delegates had advocated the principle of qualitativedisarmament,  including definite proposals affectingsea and land warfare.    Up to the present time,however, they had not declared their view as affecting Air warfare.   Nearly every nation had made proposals on this subject, and if some statement was not made in the near future by the United kingdom representatives it would, call for remark both atGeneva and at home, more especially as the TechnicalCommittees of the Conference were now considering these subjects.In the course of the discussion the cabinet were informed by the Ministers who had beer, at Genevathat alternative proposals had been made as to what our contribution should, be towards progress in Airdisarmament on the qualitative side.    One suggestionwras a new law of war, that is to say, the prohibitiorof bomb-dropping on the territory and shipping of another Sovereign Signatory State.    The other was for the abolition of heavy bombers.    Both plans hadbeen subjected to criticism.    In the course of thediscussions of the United Kingdom. Delegation atGeneva it had been found, that the question dependedto a considerable extent on the effect of theproposals on the defence against air attack ofLondon (and other possible objectives in theUnited Kingdom).   A question had arisen as to
whether these proposals might not prove detrimental to the safety of London in time of war.    Therepresentatives of the Dominions were, it was -under-stood, willing to consider the co-ordination of theirpolicy with ours in this matter.The subject was discussed both on its merits and as to the best method by which the various issues could be focussed for the use of the Cabinet.In the course of the discussion on the merits of the controversy the Lord President of the Councilinformed the Cabinet that as Chairman of the Committeeon Coast Defence he had had. to devote much attentionto a somewhat analogous problem.    He felt that alltalk of achieving serious results by mere reduction-and limitation of air armaments, and more especially by trying to civilise war in the air, was really awaste of time.    He had been impressed with the appall-r-ing conseqtiences of a future war conducted from theair.    If the nations were serious on the question of disarmament they ought to agree to scrap all militaryand naval aviation.    Civil aviation also would haveto be dealt with, perhaps by abolishing the costlysubsidies devoted to this purpose.   He was quite aware that his proposal was not likely to be accepted by foreign nations, and perhaps not by his colleagues.He emphasised, however, the impossibility of stopping the horrors of war once war had begun, as proved by our own experience.    If his proposal should provefeasible it would remove one of the main elements of that fear that was such a disturbing feature inthe international situation today.   He realised that&apos;his proposal would evoke much opposition, especially from the young men, to whom air forces were attractive.
If they rejected it they must hot complain, that thenext war was an &quot;old manfs war&quot;.      He had been forcedto the present conclusion as he saw no other way outof the difficulty.The Cabinet were impressed by the Lord Presidentsproposal, against which no objection of principle was raised.      It was felt, however,   that, in view ofits probable rejection,  it was essential to have somepolicy as to the many proposals that had. been madeto the Disarmament Conference.The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that the discussions with representatives ofthe Dominions at Geneva had indicated that they wouldbe prepared to be guided in their policy by what wasdecided as to the risks to London.     Referring to theproposed restriction on bombing, he pointed out that,in the event of war, bombs would be used whether theywere fired from land or from air;    in the same way as,  inspite of the prohibitions, all nations were assuming thatpoison gas would be used.      He thought the right plan to adopt at the Disarmament Conference was to stateclearly what we could do in the way of qualitativedisarmament.     We had made proposals for sea and landqualitative disarmament;    and the Air Ministry, whichwas the responsible Department, had made clear what they -thought should be the air policy in that connection.He would like to state our intentions frankly to theConference.      If they once plunged into the theory of bombing,  the Conference would sit for ever.On the question of procedure there were two alternative proposals before the Cabinet;    first,to refer the question that had arisen at Geneva tothe new Services Committee (on the lines of the
pre-War &quot;High-Level Bridge&quot;)  set up by the Cabinet onApril 13, 1932 (Cabinet 21   (32) Conclusion 4).      ThePrime Minister, however, was unable to preside at that committee, for the reasons mentioned in the preceding minute.     The other proposal was to refer the matter to the Coast Defence Sub-Committee, which,  the cabinet were informed, was nearing the completion of its Reporton the original terms of reference.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Coast Defence Sub-Committeeshould be invited to consider, moreparticularly from the point of viewof the defence against air attack ofLondon and other possible objectives in the United Kingdom,  the various proposals that had been made forAir disarmament,  and to make recommend-ations to the Cabinet as to the policyof the United Kingdom Delegation:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be invitedto attend the meetings of the Committee:(c) That the Committee should report,  ifpossible, in time for a specialdiscussion by the Cabinet beforeWhitsuntide.

Illk-.   The Cabinet resumed consideration of- thesubject of Civil Service Remuneration, raised inthe Most Secret Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (0.P.-13.6 (33)) that had been beforethem at the Meeting referred te in the margin.The Postmaster-General gave the Cabinetfull particulars of the objections felt by the staffof the Post Office, numbering 2^2,000 persons, tothe proposals contained in the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s Memorandum, as well as his estimateof what would be the effect if the proposals were imposed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer made astatement on the wider considerations of financial policy underlying his proposals.Towards the end of the discussion the lord privy Seal made a proposal, for consideration ofwhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for -an adjournment.*   The Cabinet agreed --(a) To adjourn the question until their next regular weekly Meeting.(b) That it is undesirable at the present stage that Ministers should receivepersonally deputations from Depart-ments, though there was no objectionto such deputations being receivedby the Permanent Heads of Departments.NOTE:-   The Prime Minister instructed the&quot;Secretary to inform the ministers concerned of the precise terms of theCabinet decision taken last Augustby the late Labour Government (Cabinet 2ft(51), Conclusion 5),. allowing CivilServants concerned to treat the reductionof 5$ in the cost of living bonus last september as their contribution to thenational emergency, and as to.the form inwhich the Treasury had communicated thatdecision to the Civil Service,
5.     The Cabinet had before them the first report of the Employment Committee (CP.-138 (38)),the Conclusions of which are summed up in paragraph16 of the Report.The Chancellor of the Exchequer havingassented to the proposals in Conclusion (1 ) withregard to the re-opening of the five closed&apos;Transfer Instructional Centres&apos;  and the keeping ofthose Centres filled, on which the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury had reserved his views,The Cabinet approved the Reportof the Committee,  the Conclusionsof which are as follows:-(1) That the Minister of labour should be authorised to carry out as an experiment the proposals regarding TTransfer InstructionalCentres&apos; set out in his Memorandum(E.C  (32)  5) y  subject, however,to the modification of paragraph 5of that Memorandum so as to securethat the scheme is limited in thefirst instance to (a) keeping the six existing Centres filled, and(b) re-opening the five closedCentres and keeping these Centresfilled.     The experiment to be tried for a period of six months and to be reviewed towards the close of that period.(2) That the Minister of labour should be authorised to organisecourses of physical instructionas proposed by him, for young menof about 18 to 30 years of age,in two or three carefully selectedexchange areas at a total costnot exceeding  ^,000 for an experiment covering 2,000 men,(3) There is no case for theproposed Mid-Scotland Canal,whether on traffic or other grounds, and accordingly no useful purpose will be served by theexpenditure of public money ona preparatory geo-physicalsurvey.(4) The proposal for a scheme fora London Outer-Circle Railway isnot one which the Cabinet shouldentertain.
(5)   (i) That the Queensferry and Rosythproposals are impracticable.(ii) That the question of assistancefrom the Road Fund towards the Kincardineproposal should be determined in theordinary course by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Minister ofTransport;    the scheme appears to usto be desirable in itself, but theMinister would no doubt before recommend-ing a grant consider, having regard tothe limited resources of the Road Fund,the urgency and relative merits of theKincardine scheme as compared with thoseof other similar schemes.-9-
If?CCALNATION.6. The President of the Board of Trade saidthat on the previous day he had seen theevious Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation,      They werepference:binet 2k- firm in their view that they could make no. 7,2), Gon-conclusion j5) . arrangement with the Mining Association unlessf^ft. .   the latter would agree in future to negotiatewages on a national basis,      The mining association could not agree to this.      He had,however, succeeded in obtaining from the mining association an undertaking that each districtwould maintain wages at their existing level for the next twelve months, which was a considerable advance.     He thought also that he might possiblyinduce the Mining Association to communicate this undertaking directly to the Miners&apos; Federation.In the circumstances the policy he advocatedwas as follows?-(i) To pass a Bill continuingPart I (Minimum Prices) of theexisting Act for a period offive years, since this wasnecessary for the stability ofthe industry,(ii) To continue the Jg-hours day,subject to the possible terms ofany international agreement onthe subject into which we mightenter.(iii) To omit the wages guarantee butto accept the guarantee offered by the Mining Association forthe next twelve months.The Cabinet approved the policy proposed by the President of theBoard of Trade, and invited him tocomplete the Bill and submit it tothe Committee of Home Affairs,  onthe understanding that parliamentary time would be found for theintroduction of the Bill,  immediatelyafter the Whitsuntide Recess.
SUNDAY PERFORM-disturbances  (REGULA-TION)  BILL,  1932(previous reference:Cabinet 19(32),  Oon-c bus ion 7 .)J. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum. by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Home Office,explaining the present situation with regard to the sunday Performances  (Regulation) Bill, 1932,circulated by the Home Secretary (C,P.-145 (32)).thatAfter pointing out/the narrow majority by which the sunday Performances Bill obtained a Second Readinghad made it apparent that its passage throughCommittee in the limited time available this session will be a matter of great difficulty, theParliamentary Under-Secretary suggested a numberof courses that were open to the Government.    Thecourse which he appeared -to favour was the intro-duction as a Government measure of a Bill embodyingcompromise terms as soon as it became apparent thatthe present Bill could make no progress in CommitteeThe compromise which, it was suggested, would findacceptance with the great majority of Members was as follows:-(l) Exhibitions of Animate and InanimateObjects (Zoos and Museums) and debatesto be exempted from the operation ofthe Sunday Observance Act,  1780.(2) Power to license Sunday concertsto be given to the same authorities which have power to license musicalentertainments on week-days, with theadditional power to attach conditionsas to the suitability of the enter-tainment,(3) Power to license Sunday cinemas to be confined to those areas to ^hich thetemporary Act applies, i,e., those areas where any cinema was opened inpursuance of a purported arrangement with the licensing authority duringthe twelve months preceding October 7,19 31.    Conditions would be imposed tosecure the six-day working week foremployees and the payment of some part of the profits to charity.(4) Power for those authorities who are&apos;not included under (3) to apply tothe House of Commons for legislativesanction through a less cumbersomeand less costly procedure than theordinary Private Bill procedure,  whichis of cotirse open to them.-1,1-
-1 2-The Parliamentary Under-Secretary raised thequestion as to whether item (4) should be includedor not.    On merits he thought it should be included,though it would undoubtedly cause some offence to the opponents.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the policy and the compromise proposal proposed above;(b) That the Home Secretary should submit to the Cabinet his detailed proposals under heading (if) of the proposedcompromise.
