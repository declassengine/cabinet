J(JN AFFAIRS.LAUSANNE ANDVA CONFERENCES.vious Referenceinet 32(32)conclusion 1.)-r.1. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL read tothe Cabinet a private and personal letter datedthe 21st June, 1932, from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to the Permanent UnderSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,  describing the position in regard to the Lausanne and GenevaConferences.    For the terms of this letter seeAppendix I.The view was expressed that since the letter was written the situation as regards the geneva conference had become somewhat more hopeful,; whilethe outlook in respect of the Lausanne conference was, perhaps, less favourable.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF .THE COUNCIL undertook to send on behalf of the Cabinet a message of congratulation and goodwill to the Prime Ministerand his colleagues on the successful start of the lausanne Conference.
THE SITUATIONIN THE IRISHFREE STATE a* * . . * .[previousReferenceCabinet35 (32)Conclusion3).2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper CP. 21fc (32)) by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, covering Mr.Be valera&apos;s letter of16th June, 1932, and were informed that at a Meetingof the Irish Situation Committee held on the previous day a reply to Mr. De Valera1 s letter had beenapproved.     For the text of this reply, which was despatched on June 22nd, see Appendix II.     The- Cabinet were also informed that an early decision wasnecessary in regard to the action to be taken byHis Majesty1s Government in the United Kingdom, andthat the requisite material was in process of preparation and would shortly be circulated with aview to the consideration of the question at theMeeting of the Cabinet on Wednesday, June 29th. 1932,Emphasis was laid on the necessity for the closest consultation with the Prime Minister and otherabsent Cabinet Ministers.      Before any decision wasreached, it would be necessary carefully to examinethe implications involved in a possible tariff war between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State,,and the reactions on Ulster of the policy in contemplation.According to information from trustworthysources, it seemed not improbable that the internal situation in the Free State might seriouslydeteriorate after the close of the EucharisticCongress.     An armed attack on Ulster was not, however,anticipated.
In this connection the Cabinet were warned that the British Coast Defence Garrisons at Queenstown,Berehaven and Lough Swilly, were not in a position to resist serious organised attacks.    It was probable thatthe Civil Guard would be on the side of law and orderin any serious trouble with the Irish Republican Army, -but it was questionable whether the Civil Guard waswell enough armed to deal with that Army.     The fact thatMr.. De Valera had given instructions that farmers in arrear with their Land Annuity payments were not to be pressed for payment indicated that he contemplated anearly General Election.     On the other hand, accordingto the latest information, Mr. De Valera had recentlyconfirmed the steamship bookings of the Free StateDelegation to the Ottawa Conference.
IRAQ: SITUATIONIN REGARD TO THEIRAQ LEVIES.lb(previousReferenceCabinet56 (32)).3,        With reference to the conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had beforethem telegrams (Paper CP. 216 (32)) from theHigh Commissioner of Iraq, and the Air OfficerCommanding in Iraq., and also further telegrams(Papers CP. 217 (32), CP. 218 (32) and cp. 219 (32)) which had passed between theSecretary of State for the Colonies and theHigh Commissioner.The Cabinet were informed that after consideration of the replies of the british authorities in Iraq. (CP. 216 (32)) to the enquiries regarding health and military measures and political considerations, which had beenmade in pursuance of the decision reached at theprevious Meeting of the Cabinet, the lord president of the Council,,, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, had agreed that aBritish Battalion should be warned to proceed toIraq, if required.     In subsequent telegrams(CP, 217 (32)) the High Commissioner had reported the autonomy, etc, claims of the Assyrianleaders and their demand that he should accept these claims by June 27th.     In reply, sir. Humphrys had asked for an assurance that theleaders would instruct the levies to remainloyal pending consideration of these demands.If the resignation of the levies could be post-poned until October, the High Commissioner did
not think it necessary, so far as he could foresee,to call for reinforcements.      In the latest telegrams&quot;before the Cabinet (CP. 218 (32) and CP. 219 (32)),the High Commissioner had reported that the Assyrianleaders had refused to agree to the resignations being withdrawn, and that he had therefore been compelled toask for the movement of the Battalion from Egypt, whichhad commenced on that day (June 22nd.)The Cabinet were also informed that in viewof the misleading nature of a Peuter message published in the Press on June 20th., the Secretary of State forWar had stated the true position in an answer givenby him on that date to a Question in the House of Lords.The Cabinet took note of and^approved the action which had been taken inregard to the sending to Iraq, ofthe reinforcing Battalion.
4.      The Cabinet had under consideration a Note bythe Deputy Secretary (CP.  215(32)) covering an extract from the Minutes of the 256th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, together with theletter (referred to in the extract) from the ColonialOffice and the accompanying Despatch of the HighCommissioner of Iraq.,  setting out the general principles of employment of the Royal Air Force inIraq, on the coming into force of the Anglo-Iraq Treatyof 1930.It was pointed out that the important points inconnection with the employment of the Royal Air force were contained in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the ColonialOffice letter.    The object of the safeguards proposed was to ensure that the Royal Air Force would not beused except in case of real necessity for the defence ofBritish lives, and also that the Royal Air Force shouldtake no action in case of internal disorder Without a written request from the Iraq Government through our ambassador, who should in each case satisfy himself that the employment proposed for the Royal Air force was suitable.    In extreme cases it might, of course,be necessary for. the Air Officer Commanding to take immediate action; but in all the circumstances it was thought that the proposed procedure would giVe thebest security possible.The Cabinet agreed-To approve the recommendation of theCommittee of Imperial Defence that theproposed general principles of employmentof the Royal Air Force in Iraq on thecoming into force of the Anglo-IraqTreaty of 1930 contained in the HighCommissioner&apos;s Despatch of the 29th May,1931,, as modified in the Colonial Officeletter of the 11th March, 1932, shouldbe accepted as the basis of our defence policy in Iraq.

The Cabinet had under consideration a Note bythe Deputy Secretary (CP.  215(32)) covering an extract from the Minutes of the 256th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, together with theletter (referred to in the extract) from the ColonialOffice and the accompanying Despatch of the HighCommissioner of Iraq;,  setting out the general principles of employment of the Royal Air Force inIraq on the coming into force of the Anglo-Iraq.

g FUTURE STATUS      5. In connection with the question discussed the BRITISHpRSSBNTATIVE in the foregoing Conclusion, the SECRETARY OPIRAQ.STATE FOR INDIA pointed out the possible reactions9 4 m -9 * -* 0p. ^ on India of whatever arrangements might he madein regard to the British Representative in Iraq,after the coming into force of the Anglo-Iraq.Treaty.The British Representative would he adiplomat with the rank, at all eventa at the outset,of an Ambassador.      It was essential, however,that his special position should be recognised andthat his status should be differentiated from thatof other diplomats in Iraq..     -Ho would-, In fact,-occupy a position similar to thai uf the- Bri LlsliRopreaontativco-in Egypt and Afghanistan.   He musthave access to the fullest information of what was going on in the country so as to be able to use his influence with the Iraq.! Government.    The Air force was most effective if used at once, and before a crisis had time to develop.     The british representative might,  in the last resort, have to warn the Iraqi Government that the Royal AirForce would have to be withdrawn if his represent-ations were disregarded.In the course of discussion the Secretaryof State for the Colonies was asked what arrange-ments were being made with regard to the retentionor otherwise of the services of certain officials at present serving under the High Commissioner ofIraq.
In the absence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Cabinet felt that no useful purpose would be served by further consideration of these questions at the moment.     At the same time it was recognised thatthe questions  should be discussed in Cabinet on theearliest convenient opportunity after the return of the  .Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to England.The Cabinet agreed : -(l) That the future status of the british representative in Iraq should beconsidered at a Meeting of the Cabinet,when the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs could be present, and that accordingly the question should be placedon the Agenda Paper for a Meeting of theCabinet in the near future, and in anycase before the departure of the UnitedKingdom Delegation for Ottawa on the13th July next.(2) To take note that the Lord Presidentof the Council proposed to confer withthe Permanent Under Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs in regard to thequestion of the position of certainofficials at present serving under theHigh Commissioner of Iraq.
rpiBE ON 6.     With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inEls from op the margins  the Cabinet had before them a MemorandummDICTION. by the Home Secretary (Paper CP.  207(32)) on thelions subject of Appeals from a Court of SummaryinetC55(3l)     Jurisdiction to Quarter Sessions.    In September lastpS^n the Cabinet had decided that it would not then beIfbli^yO1 right to appoint a Departmental Committee to considerthe question.    During the Committee stage of theChildren and Young Persons Bill an undertaking had, however been given that the Government proposed,  as soon aspracticable, to appoint a Committee, and the HomeSecretary suggested that a Committee should now beset up consisting of Sir William Kyffin-Taylor(Chairman), Sir Ernley Blackwell, Sir John Withers, M.P.(who sponsored the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) bill of last Session),  the Chief Magistrate and one of theleading Recorders.    Such a Committee would be an expertbody and would not require to take evidence.    It wouldnot be necessary for the Committee to sit more than afew times, and the inquiry would not involve theexpenditure of any appreciable sum of public money.The appointment of the Committee would, however, beon the definite understanding that until the financialposition of the country had improved, effect would notbe given to any of its recommendations involving any considerable expenditure of public money.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the Home Secretary&apos;s proposalssummarised above respecting the appointmentof a Committee to consider the question of appeals from a Court of Summary Jurisdictionto Quarter Sessions.
7.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (CP.  205(33))covering a Memorandum summarising certain Reports onthe industrial surveys of the depressed areasundertaken by the Universities in the four areasprincipally affected.The object of the enquiries was to present a survey of the present industrial position of theareas, and of the prospects of early expansion andnew development! and to assess, as far as practicable,the prospective employment capacity of the various industries in the areas as a basis for an estimateof the volume of labour likely to be surplus to therequirements of new industries within the next fewyears.took note of these documents.
HS ELECTIONSN MALTA.previous reference cabinet 33(32l Conclusion 3.I   F/? -4The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the&apos;Secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper CP.210(32))  covering a copy of a telegram from LordStrickland on the subject of the results of therecent Malta elections.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  THE COLONIES informed the Cabinet that the leaders of the Nationalist Party(Mooorou Ugo Mifsud and/Mizzi) had requested theGovernor of Malta to inform him that they proposed,,immediately on taking office., to make representationsagainst the provisions of the Malta Constitution Bill,/ and that they,  therefore,  requested that until theywere in a position to make such representations thepassage of the Bill into law should be deferred.    He(the Secretary of State) had telegraphed to theGovernor of Malta that there would,  of course, be nochange in the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad announced,  and that the Bill would proceed.,The Cabinet took note of, and approved, theaction which the Secretary of State for theColonies had taken in regard to this matter.
9-     The Cabinet took note of Weekly Reports byLocal Governments on the Political Situation inIndia, circulated for their information by theSecretary of State for India (CP. 213(32)).
NEXT       10.       The Cabinet agreed :-meeting of THE To hold their next Meeting on cabinet. Friday, June 24th 1933, at10.30 a,m. in the PrimeMinister&apos;s Room at the House.... of Commons, for considerationinter alia of a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India covering the draft of theproposed Parliamentary statement, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.33nd June, 1932,
Letter dated 20 June 1932 from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.jbxiyate and Personal.My dear Van,I will try to send this by the bag tonight andto put what I say in a form which could be sentacross to S.B. on the chance that he would like to read it, or summarise it, at the   Cabinet onYvrednesday.As regards Lausanne, we have certainly madea good start.     The appointment of the P.M. to bePresident of the Conference is. everywhere mostwarmly approved and, notwithstanding the handicap ofhis recent illness, he is bearing his heavy taskwith a courage and resource which makes us allproud of him.      It was certainly a big stroke toget the&apos; Declaration, signed by the five creditorinviting Powers, signed and read out at the verybeginning of our proceedings.     The last signature,that of Belgium, was only obtained half an hourbefore the opening, but we made it plain that itwas then or never and thirty-six hours of almostcontinuous negotiation over drafts and counter-drafts with Harriot and his colleagues producedultimate unanimity.     The result is to produce a firm impression that we mean business and willnot be content with a mere short moratorium andnothing done.To-day (Monday) is being devoted to privateconsultations between the leading Delegations andin particular to discussions with Herriot and Germain-
ff^hMartin as to the course now to he taken.Unhappily, the Chancellor of the Exchequer wasstruck down last night with a had attack of goutand is hors de combat and in bed to-day, but before nightfall I feel sure that we shall havea. plan to put forward at the full meeting tomorrow.There is of course very great difficulty in reaching clear cut decisions without bringingdown upon our heads denunciation from acrossthe Atlantic which may make the American debtan issue in the Presidential Election,     You willnotice that, so far, it has been kept  out ofthe Republican platform, but indiscriminatevehemence - and even perhaps undue plainness of speech - at Lausanne might cause one or other or both of the American parties to add this question as an election issue.      I think that I correctlysummarise the main lines of our policy at Lausanne,as it is being evolved, by saying:(1)    That we try.to bring out the point thatit is not a question of any particular country&apos;obligations or of any particular country&apos;capacity to pay, but that it is this system of attempting the transfer of great blocks of payment across the frontiers without anycorresponding return in the form of commercialtrade which has ruined both the circulation ofcommerce and the credit and confidence of peoples.Though we do not say so, this proposition ofcourse applies to the   American debt no lessthan to reparations and to European governmentalobligations;    and it avoids raising the dangeroustest of capacity to pay as the measure of whatmust be done in the future by this country or that.
(2)     At the same time we are endeavouring toprevent the issue talcing such a shape as to provokeimmediate American challenge.     Whether we shall succeed in this remains to he seen.    But to this end, there isa good deal of consideration going on behind the scenesas to broader matters of policy, such as a political trucein Europe, the condition of Central European countries, andhopes (such as they are) for disarmament.Passing from Lausanne to Geneva (and at present I amdoing this journey in the early morning and late at nightdaily), Henderson has in fact declared a suspension ofhis operations    to see whether private conversations offermore prospect of practical and quick achievement.    TheHome Secretary has been good enough to come over to helpat Geneva.    Londonderry, he    and I have had two or three days of pretty continuous labour, first seeing the americans and now in a tripartite discussion including theFrench.    We also had Grahdi ^Q lunch todaysNadolny tomorrow.Our object is-to find out what can be done in the courseof the next month, and, while we none of us despair, it becomes increasingly obvious that on every point of substance there are mountains of difficulty to be overcome.Indeed, it is questionable whether the French (whothoroughly realise that their ambitious plan for turningthe League of Nations into a super State and forming aninternational force is doomed) are really contemplatingany serious agreement.    We can only afford a few days forthese informal discussions for they are in no sense a substitute for Henderson&apos;s authorised machinery.    If,after a few more days, this does not produce agreements of value, we contemplate trying to frame a British proposal covering land, sea and air on wide lines such as
we   think ought to he the results of the Conference andto bring it forward publicly   in a week or two in order to&quot;give a lead&quot; - whether the lead is followed or not.    Ofcourse, we cannot formulate this programme without firstdeciding on its terms and secondly getting full authorityfor putting it forward.   And it is an appalling job.Yours ever,(Sd.) JOHN SIMON
APPENDIX    II. *        338toDRAFT REPLY TO MR.   DE VALERA&apos;S LETTER OF 16th JUNE.   1932.(As approved hy the Irish Situation Committee on June 21st, 1932.)DOMINIONS OFFICE,DOWNING STREET,June, 1932.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of yourdespatch No. 89 of the 16th June regarding the question of theLand Annuities.2.      His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom note thatthe Government of the Irish Free State accept the principle ofarbitration in relation to the Annuities and agree that a tribunal of the general character outlined in the Report of theImperial Conference of 1930 would be suitable.3.      It is observed, however, from paragraph 2 of your despatchthat the Government of the Irish Free State consider that the personnel of the tribunal should not be limited solely tocitizens of the States of the.British Commonwealth.     As to thisI would point out that in 1930, when the question of machineryfor the settlement of differences between the Members of theCommonwealth was considered by the Imperial Conference, theconclusions unanimously adopted by the Conference contemplated that, in the event of a tribunal being set up in any individual case in pursuance of those conclusions, neither the Chairman norany of the other members of the tribunal should be drawn from outside the British Commonwealth.      His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom feel that this is a point of principle, inrespect of which they would not be justified in departing fromthe conclusions of the Conference.
4.      His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom furthernote that the Government of the Irish Free State are ofopinion that the matters to he submitted to the tribunal should include other annual payments due from the IrishFree State to the Government of the United Kingdom.      HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are not aware of any dispute with regard to any such payments or of thegrounds for disputing liability.      His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin tfe.e Unitod Kingdom would however observe that they areunable to admit the distinction sought to bo drawn betweenagreements formally ratified by the Parliaments of theUnited Kingdom and the Irish Free State and other agreementsformally entered into between the two countries,5.      The proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government isi the UnitedKingdom t^ submit the question of the Land Annuities to arbitration is based o^i the assumption that the two sideswill have agreed in advance to bft bound by the arbitraldecis ion.21st June, 1952
