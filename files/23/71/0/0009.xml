At the request of some of his colleagues the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairss in theabsence of the Chancellor of the Exchequers gave theCabinet an explanation of the new agreement announced in, the newspapers of the same date? making provision forthe repayment to the United States of America of theannuity? which has not been paid during the year   of theHoover Moratorium.     The Secretary of State explainedthat provision had to be made as to how the omitted year9during which no payment was made owing to the HooverMoratoriums should be made up9 and this alone was thepurpose of the agreement which was about to be signed.He also explained the reasons why the United StatesGovernment had desired that the agreement should be signed on9 or soon after9 May 20th.It was pointed out that, although the information given by the Times newspaper was accurate and possiblyofficially inspired, some other papers contained in-accurate -accounts of the agreement.In the circumstances the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs undertook to arrange with the treasury for the issue of an official statementsprobably in theform of a special notice Qaestion and Answer inParliament.
OUR OFFICEefeWnce:aUnet 2732) Oon-conclusion 1.F-R.&quot;My-%.      The Minister of Labour reverted once more tothe question he had raised at the meeting referred to inthe margin as to the vacancy in the. post of Director ofthe International Labour Office.      An informal meetingof the members of the governing body,, assembled for thefuneral of Monsieur Thomas.had been held in Paris duringthe previous weeky and it had been arranged that the vacancy should be filled at the next meeting at the endof June.     The position of Mr. Harold Butler, the deputy director of the International Labour Office had in con-sequence become rather delicate.     He was being asked ifthe Government of the United Kingdom was supporting hiscandidature for the post of Director.      In the circumstances the Minister of Labour thought it advisable that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should give Mr. Butler all possiblesupport, and he suggested that the Foreign Office should do all they could to make this clear to the twelve Govern-ments concerned.      If the Cabinet shared his view theMinister would himself approach the representatives of theBritish Employers and the Secretary to the Trades UnionCongress on the subject.      The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs agreed in principle with the Minister ofLabour,     He had heard from Sir Eric Drummond that therewas no reason why the post should be filled in June, butthat, as the International Labour Organization was entirelyindependent in the matter, there was every prospect thatthe governing body would fill the vacancy in June.      sir eric Drummond, he added, would be in London next week, andif the question could be postponed for a week it would bepossible to consult him as to whether there was any possibility of a British successor to Sir Eric himself inthe post of Secretary General to the League of Nations.
If Mr. Harold Butler were appointed Director of theInternational Labour Office, there would be no prospectof this.    But in any event he thought it extremely unlikelythat Sir Eric Drummond could be succeeded by a british subject.The Cabinet agreed with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs that it was unlikely that the nextSecretary General to the League of Nations could be aBritish subject.     As they were advised by the Ministerof Labour that any further delay would prejudice Mr.Butler&apos;s prospects, they agreed -to authorise the Minister of Labour and secretary of State for Foreign affairs to do their best to support Mr. HaroldButler&apos;s candidature to the post of director of the International LabourOffice.

BBNMENT(previous reference:Cabinet 27(32) Con-clusion 13.)4.      The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary to the Cabinet (CP. -163 (32)) on thesubject of Government Business, circulating by direction of the Lord President of the Council alist of Bills which.,  in the opinion of the Ministers-concerned,  should be passed into law before the summer Recess (Appendix l).The Lord President of the Council made astatement to the Cabinet of his proposed programmeof business for the House of Commons until the endof the present session (Appendix II).The Cabinet agreed -(a) T-o approve the programme of business for the House of Commons until theend of the session? contained inAppendix II, subject to the following conclusions.(b) That the following-Bills, which are essential, should be introducedfirst in the House of Lordss-The Dominion Forces Bill(Dominions Office)The Extradition Bill(Home Office)(c) To take note that the ministers concerned are willing that thefollowing measures should not betaken during the present sessions -The Cotton Bill(Board of Trade)The Rent Restriction bill^)3.

THS LONDONPASSENGERTRANSPORT(previous reference:Cabinet 79(31), Con-clusion 15.)F-H.5. The Lord President of the Council&apos;   informed the Minister of Transport that the discussion that had just taken place on the subject of the business in Parliament for the remainder of the Session had shown that it would be virtually impossible to pass the London Passenger Transport Bill during thepresent Session.The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinetthat progress had been made as regards the Boardand appointing Trustees, as well as placing facilitiesunder.the jurisdiction of the Railway Rates Tribunal.There had been discussions and explanations withopposing groups in the House of Commons.    One maL nissue (that of the Metropolitan Railway ) remained,,relatively small financially, but embodying potentialdifficulties politically.      He had felt that anagreement fair to all parties was the best way out,and had got the various parties to meet.      TheMetropolitan Railway Company said that they did notbelieve in the &quot;C&quot; Stock.      The Main Line Railwayshad then replied that they would take the risk and give the Metropolitan Railway a guarantee.     An offer to this effect had been made and rejected.    The subject had been reopened during Whitsuntide,    A new offer fromthe Metropolitan Railway had now been rejected by theMain Lines,      In his opinion the offer of the Main Lineshad been generous.    In the meantime the delay in thesettlement of this question had checked progress in theelectrification of and improvement in suburbantraffic, as could be seen from the speeches of the chairmen of the Railway Companies.    Large economies in working had been lost, and great traffic undertakingshad been left in a state of complete uncertainty.
The attitude of the Metropolitan Railway Company,and perhaps also of the London County Council, was likely to he influenced toy a definite decision.In the circumstances the Minister suggested that anundertaking should toe given to proceed with the Billafter the Recess,  to pass it into law this year inany events and with this object to carry over the bill until next Session toy a Resolution in tooth Houses.This latter Resolution, he explained, was necessary inorder to avoid reopening the question again from thetoeginning in the next Session of Parliament,, which wouldInvolve great expense and waste of past efforts.The Secretary of State for War, as Leader of theHouse of Lords, said he would do his &quot;best to get aResolution through the House of Lords, tout there was still a tendency in that House to regard the bill as a Socialist measure,and he expected to encountersome difficulties, which, however, he hoped wouldnot toe insuperable.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the London Passenger transport bill should not be proceeded withduring the present Session ofParliament;(b) That in announcing the Business ofParliament next week the Lord Presidentof the Council should include a state-ment that it was Intended to proceedwith the Bill after the Recess and topass it into law during the presentyear:(c) That both Houses of Parliament shouldbe asked to pass a Resolution carrying the London Passenger Transport Billover until the next Session of Parlia-^ment.
ttlPsRLOO 6. The First Commissioner of Works informed theCabinet that he had been asked whether the Rouse of(previous Commons might be allowed a free vote on the questionReference:Cabinet 4 of Waterloo Bridge, which would be raised during(32) , C on-clusion 6.) the following week.F.R.?he Minister of Transport informed the Cabinetthat if the London County Council Money Bill were defeated, a situation might arise in which the CountyCouncil might decide that as regards their portionof the cost of the bridge, that is, 40 per cent.,they would, having lost their Money Resolution forthis sum, provide it out of their own resources andthen call upon the Government to fulfil their under-taking to provide the remaining 60 per cent.   Thiswould,  in fact, produce a situation in which theHouse of Commons by inference having decided thatthe existing bridge should nbt be pulled down, theGovernment would be providing 60 per cent, of thecost of doing it unless they entirely repudiatedtheir bargain;   which latter strp would be indeedunfortainat-e.   He had informed the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury of this difficulty, andhad suggested to him that it might be necessary toensure the passage of the London County CouncilMoney Bill,After a short discussion, the Cabinet agreed  That it would be necessary to put onthe Government Whips on the questionof Waterloo Bridge.
1B4iBMBNTAEYOPOOLS.ge of-previous reference:Cabinet 40(31), Con-elusion 9 .)FJL7, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Education (CP.-165(33)) on the subject of the age of admission toelementary schools, stating that the following question had been put down for Thursday, May 26th:-&quot;Captain North - To ask the Presidentof the Board of Education, if he willstate what would be the estimatedeconomy involved by raising the age for admission to elementary schoolsfrom five to six years &apos;    and whetherit is the intention of the Governmentto take any action on sueh lines&quot;,to which he proposed to give the following answer,subject to the approval of his colleagues:-&quot;Unless legislation was passedexcluding all children under sixfrom the schools for all purposes .the amount of saving would bedifficult to estimate but would rprobably be small.On the assumption that such legisla-tion was passed and that no steps were taken to replace the educational and social facilities thus withdrawnthe total saving to the Exchequer isestimated to be &quot;about  2,000,000 ayear.    In some areas,  and especiallyin the Counties, an increased burden would be thrown on the rates, as the saving to the authorities in expenditure would be less than the loss in grant.While the effect would vary indifferent localities,  the authorities as a whole would lose to the extentof about  125,000 a year.I have not at present in contemplationany change in the law of school attendance.&quot;The President of the Board of Education made astatement to the Cabinet developing the case as set-forth in his Memorandum,   The only question raisedwas as to the desirability, particularly in theabsence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, of safeguarding the position in case it might benecessary on financial grounds to reopen the questionlater in the year.    It was pointed out, however,that the position of the- Chancellor of the Exchequer
was secured by the words &quot;at present&quot; in the last paragraph of the proposed answer.The Cabinet approved the statement to be made by the President of theBoard of Education as set forth above.
g COALBS BILLeviouseference:cabinet 2632), Con-conclusion 6.)Fa.8 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade &quot;(H.A.-26 (32))covering the draft Coal Mines Bill, the object ofwhich was to carry out the following conclusion reached by the Cabinet at the Meeting referred toin the margin:-(i) To pass a Bill continuing Part I(Minimum Prices) of the existingAct for a period of five years,since this was necessary for the stability of the industry:(ii) To continue the 7^-hours day,subject to the possible terms ofany international agreement onthe subject into which we mightenter:(iii) To omit the wages guarantee, butto accept the guarantee offered by the Mining Association for thenext twelve months:together with the following ^ecommendation of theCommittee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C. 8th Con-elusions  (32), Paragraph 1):-To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the CoalMines Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-26 (32)., subject toany drafting or other minor altera-tions that may be found necessary or desirable, with.a view to itsenactment before the 8th July, 1932.The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that if the recommendation of theCommittee of Home Affairs was approved he proposedto make a brief statement on the following day;to circulate the Bill on Friday of the present week; and to introduce it and pass it through all stages as early as possible during next week.   he added, in reply to questions, that he proposed toput in the forefront of his statement on the morrowthe individual guarantee from each of the constituentdistricts of the Mining Association that wages would be maintained, for a further, twelve months from
July 8th next at the levels provided for underSection 2 of the 19S1 Act.The Cabinet approved the recommenda-tion of the Committee of Home affairs and the proposals of the President ofthe Board of Trade as set forth above
MALTA.onstitutinnill.previous reference:Cabinet 15(32), Con-clusion 4.)a.9.The Cabinet had under consideration a&apos; Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies (H.A.-25 (32)), covering the draft malta constitution Bill, which was required as a resultof the Conclusion reached by the Cabinet at theMeeting referred to in the margin, namely, toaccept without alteration all the recommendations in the Report of the Malta Royal Commission(Cmd.39^3)  except those relating to language andto the Police:    together with the following conclu-sions of the Committee of Home Affairs thereon(H.A.C. 8th Conclusions (32), Paragraph 2):-(i)  In the event of its being decided to legislate on the lines laid down bythe Cabinet on the 24th February, 1932,to recommend the Cabinet to authorisethe introduction in the House of lords of the Malta Constitution Bill in theform of the draft annexed to H.A.-25(32), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be foundnecessary or desirable.(ii) In the event of its being decided notto proceed with the Malta ConstitutionBill, to take note that the Secretaryof State proposed to give effect underthe Letters Patent of 19 50 to the pro-visions in the Bill regarding Judges,Police,  etc.(iii) To take note that the Secretary ofState proposed to consult with theLaw Officers in regard to the questionof the validity of the Letters Patentof 1930.(iv) That if, as a result of the LawOfficers&apos; Opinion on (iii) above,there appeared to be serious riskof an adverse decision in the courts in the event Of the Letters Patent of1930 being challenged, to recommend the Cabinet to authorise the Secretaryof State to introduce, without further reference to the Home Affairs Committee,a short Bill to validate all acts done under the 1930 Letters Patent.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies apologisedto his colleagues for bringing up rather a largequestion at such short notice.   He recalled thehistory o^&quot; this question, the salient features ofwhich may be summed up as follows.On May 1, 19 30, before the pending Elections inthe Island of Malta, the Archbishop of Malta and the bishop of Gozo had issued a joint Pastoral (copiesof which were handed round to the Cabinet by theSecretary of State), the salient passages of whichwere as follows:-&quot;(l) You may not, without committing a grave sin, vote for Lord Stricklandand his candidates, or for all those,even of other parties, who in the pasthave helped and supported him in hisfight against the rights and the discipline of the Church, or whopropose to help and stipport him in the coming elections ,(s) For even stronger reasons you may not-present yourselves as candidates inthe electoral lists proposed by LordStrickland or by othe1&quot; parties whopropose to support him in the comingelection.(3) You are also solemnly bound in con-science in the present circumstances to take part in the elections and to vote for those persons who, by theirattitude in the past, offer greaterguarantee both for religious welfare and for sodial welfare.In order, then, to prevent abuses inthe administration and reception ofthe Sacraments, we remind our prieststhat they are strictly forbidden to administer the Sacraments to theobstinate who refuse to obey theseour instructions.&quot;In consequence of this interference by the Bishopswith the freedom of the vote, the Labour Governmenthad decided to suspend the Constitution of Malta,and the Flection had not taken place. , On April 7,19 31, a Royal Commission had been appointed, whichhad visited the Island and rendered a Report.
This Report had been based on the assumption that before the next &quot;lections the Bishops would issue a Pastoral of a totally different character.   TheSecretary of State supported this by reading extracts from Chapter XIII of the Report of the Royal Commis-sion (Cmd.3993. C.P.-73 (33)), including the follow-&quot;We feel that the next Pastoral will be framed in the interests of peace andgood will, particularly in a matter ofsuch world-wide interest, far transcend-in g the comparatively minor interestsof Malta and involving the interestsof a great Empire and of the roman catholic Church in all quarters ofthe world,&quot;In accordance with the recommendations of theRoyal Commission it had then been decided that parliamentary government should be restored and thatan Flection should take place.    Notwithstanding theanticipations of the Royal Commission referred toabove, the Maltese Bishops on May 20th last, on the eve of the new Flection, had issued a fresh Pastoral,which the Secretary of State circulated to theCabinet, and from which he read the following extract:-&quot;TJnfortunatel3/ the situation of twoyears ago, from the religious pointof view, has remained unchanged,certainly not through the fault of us Bishops or of the Holy See.Therefore there is no reason why Weshould give to the clergy and to thepeople of these dioceses fresh instruc-tions regarding the exercise of the rightto vote in the forthcoming, politicalelections, as We have already ;given thenecessary directions by Our Pastoralpublished on the 1st May, 1930&quot;.The Secretary of State then read to the cabinet a series of questions he had addressed to theGovernor, together with His Excellency&apos;s replies,to the effect that the Bishops&apos; Pastoral of 1930was reaffirmed, ignoring the Royal Commission;that its reaffirmation would prevent a certain
number of electors from voting in accordance withtheir real views;    that both Lord Strickland and the malta Labour Party thought nevertheless that theElection should take place;    that suspension of theConstitution would be resented by the three parties;that in the event of suspension of the Constitutionthere should be no difficulty in carrying on CrownColony government;    some disorder might be expected,but it could be controlled;,  that in the event of an election taking place the National Government was likely in any case to have sectired a majority;    andthat on a purely local view.the Governor&apos;s personal opinion was. that the Election should be allowed totake place, provided that the Secretary of State forthe Colonies supported him. on all reserved subjects.The action of the Maltese Bishops in reaffirmingtheir previous Pastoral was recognised by the cabinet as completely falsifying the expectations on whichthe Royal Commission had based its recommendations,and as reproducing in an aggravated form the conditionswhich had led the Labour Government to suspend the malta Constitution and to hold no Election, It was felt that the Bishops had. rendered impossible the freeworking of the Constitution of Malta, and. that both from the wider point of&apos;view and probably even fromthat of the Government of Malta, it would be undesir-able to allow fresh Elections to take place.The Cabinet agreed  (a) ^o approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for the colonies that the Constitution of Malta should remain suspended and that no Electionshould be held:(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,should draft, for the approval of the
Lord President of the Council, a considered statement to be made inthe House of Commons announcing the. above decision and setting forth thereasons, with appropriate extracts from the Pastoral Letters of the maltese Bishops and the Report ofthe Royal Commission;(c) That the above statement should beso drawn as to avoid giving offence to Roman Catholics:(d) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should inform Lord Pitzalanof the action to be taken:(e) That it would be unnecessary toproceed with the Malta ConstitutionBill:(f) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should give effect, underthe Letters Patent of 1950, to theprovisions of the Bill regardingJudges, Police, etc.:(g) To take note that the Law Officersof the Crown did not advise that itwas necessary to introduce a Billto. validate acts done under the 1950Letters Patent,.
THE CARRIAGE 10 .The Cabinet had tinder consideration aBY AIR BILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air(Previous (H.A.-24 (32)), covering the draft Carriage by AirReference:Cabinet 33 Bill, the object of which was to give effect in the(31), Con-clusion 7.)

He then made freshsuggestions resulting from this meeting and from a subsequent discuss ion he-had held with the permanent secretaries to some of the Departments mainly concerned.In the absence of the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet felt reluctant to take a fresh decision,and agreed  (a) That the Permanent Secretary to themreasury should prepare a memorandum for their consideration:(b) That in circulating it he should inform them of the views held bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer:(c) That the question should be taken atthe next Meeting of the Cabinet.

29if sittings are available up to Friday,  8th July,  so the aboveprogramme would necessitate the House sitting until Wednesday,13th July.The possibilities of saving on this estimate wouldappear to be not more than       days -r(i)    if the Irish debate could take place on a Supply day -save 1 day, and (ii)  if the Lords Amendments to the Town planning bill could be disposed of in i- day - save -g- day - 1-g-,This saving would provide a small margin of safety for contingencies,  such as,  extra time being required for any of the major Bills,   (e.g.  if the Sunday Entertainments Bill meets withobstruction in the Standing Committee and has to be brought downto the floor of the House)  time for Chairman of Ways and MeansBills and for the passage of the following minor Bills,  etc.:-Report and 3rd Reading:Hire Purchase and Small Debt  (Scotland) Bill.All stages of:Public Works Loans Bill;Isle of Man (Customs)   (No,2)  Bill;Development Loan Guarantee Grants Continuation Bill;British Museum Bill (HL);Patents and Designs Bill (HL);Agricultural Credits  (Mortgages)  Bill (HL);Solicitors  (Consolidation) Bill (HL);  .Marriages  (Naval, Military and Air Force Chapels) BIll(HL),Some of these measures are of a non-.contentious- character and ought not to raise any great difficulty.      The Children and young Persons Bill has already passed the House of Commons and isnow awaiting consideration in the House of Lords and the universities  (Scotland)  Bill which originated in the Lords hasbeen returned to that House with Commons amendments.It will probably be necessary to pass resolutions (knownas &quot;Monk resolutions&quot;)   in Committee and on Report (before supply is closed)  to provide for the application of surpluses anddeficits on Fighting Services Estimates.      These statements are-&quot;vetted&quot; by the Public Accounts Committee and the consequent
It is assumed that Parliament will be prorogued in july and not adjourned until the Autumn.      If it is a case of adjourn-ment a day would of course be required for such a motion.resolutions rarely occupy any time in the House of Commonsbeyond a ministerial explanation.This statement leaves out of account the following-measures which, are contained in CD.  163(32).Bill dealing with the financial emergency  ...
