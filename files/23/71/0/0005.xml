trADE WITH 1.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-134 (32))(previous circulating a Memorandum by the Secretary of the reference:Cabinet 9 Department of Overseas Trade covering a Report by(32), Con-clusion 7,) the Export Credits Guarantee Department&apos;s AdvisoryCommittee,.    The President of the Board of Trade askedfor authority to proceed on the lines suggested inparagraphs 9 and 10 of the Committee&apos;s Report,recommending, subject to various provisions, anextension of the guarantees in respect of ordersfr om Rus s ia .The President of the Board of Trade explained to the Cabinet that he was anxious not to lose certain important orders,  especially for the machine toolindustry, for which, we were in severe competition with the Germans and to a less extent with the Czecho-Slovaks.As the Chancellor of the Exchequer, owing topreoccupations with the Budget introduced on theprevious day, had not had time to go into the questioncarefully, no decision was taken and the discussion was of a preliminary character.Some misgivings were expressed as to whether,if the guarantees to Soviet Russia were increased,we should not be told one day that we should lose the whole unless we gave more orders.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet thatinvestigations conducted by the Committee of ImperialDefence had shown the great importance of the machine tool industry in certain eventualities,^he suggestion was made that it would.be an advantage if, when the subject.was next discussed, theCabinet could also have before them the Report of theCabinet Committee on Trade with Russia.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that ifhe could not himself attend the meeting some other minister would have to take the Chair and he himself would send a representative.The Cabinet agreed ; (a) To postpone the question raisedby the President of the Board ofTrade in C.P.-134 (32) until their next regular weekly Meeting:(b) That in the meantime the CabinetCommittee on Trade with Russia,appointed at the Meeting referredto in the margin, should meet with a view to reporting to theCabinet at their next Meeting:(o) That the Secretary should arrange a meeting of the Russian trade committee, if possible, beforethe end of the present week.
PALESTINE. 2. The Cabinet had before them the Report of aCabinet Committee (CP.-132 (32)) on the question of setting up a Legislative Council in Palestine.The Cabinet approved the recommendations ofthe Committee, which are as follows:- &apos;(a) ^hat the action proposed by the HighCommissioner, namely, the second alter-native in paragraph 3 , should be approved:(b) That there should,  if possible, beno Government pronouncement at thepresent time in this country asregards the establishment of a legislative Council:(c) That the High Commissioner should beallowed to use his discretion in themanner of carrying out the policy approved;   he should, however, avoid,If possible, raising the issue ofthe Legislative Council at the presenttime;    but should, if satisfactory progress were made in the meantime onthe lines proposed by the HighCommissioner, prepare a statementsuitable for communication to thePermanent Mandates Commission inthe Autumn of 1932:(d) That in communicating the Government&apos;decision, the Secretary of State should put it on record, for Sir A. Wauchope&apos;sown information, that the Governmentfavour the establishment of a legislative Council as soon as theconditions permit.government policy.Question of aLegis lativeCounc il.HR.ft.(previous reference:Cabinet- 20(32), Con-elusion 5.)36The second alternative is dealt with in paragraph 3of the Report as follows:-^&quot;The second alternative is for me tosay quietly to the leaders to whom Ihave spoken that the Government has given a pledge, and is determined to redeem it,   But, before forming a legislative Council, we consider thatit is advisable to do three things forthe good of the country and for thetraining of responsible people inresponsible work:-(l) Continue and extend our policy ofgiving Administrative work toPalestinians by appointing bothArabs and Jews to such Councilsas the Agricultural Council:(2) Establish Local Councils and newMunicipal bodies throughout thecountry, probably in 1932:
(3) Appoint some Palestinian members to the Advisory Council in 1932.In furtherance of (l) I have alreadyappointed unofficial members to the RoadBoard, and shall make similar appoint-ments to the Standing Committee forCommerce and Industry and the RailwayBoard in the near future, and I amconsidering further possibilities inthe same direction&quot;.
Pjg COAL 3*    ^&quot;ne President of the Board of Trade made atTUATION.1 verbal report to the Cabinet as to the presentrevicus position of the Coal Situation.      He had seen theeference:cabinet 21 Coal Owners and had felt it necessary to refer to32), Con-elusion 8) . the difficulty which previous Governments had, experienced in negotiating with them.     He had2[fe^ . warned them that Members of Parliament returnedby mining constituencies to support the national government might be found to adopt an attitudelittle different from that of their predecessors,and that the Owners should disillusion themselvesif they had any idea that the present Governmentwere specially favourable to their case.He recalled the main difficulties whichhad in the past prevented agreement being reached between the Mineowners and the Miners, mentioningfirst the question of the district or national basis for wages.      The Miners wished their wage negotiations  to be conducted by the Miners&apos;Federation.      The Owners wanted district agreements,refused to negotiate with the Miners&apos; Federation,and said that the Mining Association had no powersto do so.      If no legislation took place before july 8th, when the present Act expires, we shouldslide on to a seven-hour day.      The. Miners did not really want this, but said that if the 7^-hoursday were to be continued they must have someguarantee as  to wages, since the guarantee includedin the existing Act would expire with the Actitself.      The Miners would press for a nationalguarantee, but it was possible that they mightbe induced to accept a district arrangement,provided that it was communicated nationally,  for
example,  through the Mining Association.      he himself had warned the Owners  that if they couldnoifc reach agreement with the Miners,  the Governmentwould be compelled, by a single-clause Bill,  tocontinue last year7s Act for another twelvemonths.      That Bill would have to be introduced,for Parliamentary reasons, not later than May 12th.The President of the Board of Trade did notconsider that that would be a satisfactory arrangement.      It would lead to loss of manycontracts and perhaps permanent loss of trade.,but he did not see any other way if the two parties could not reach agreement.      The Ownersthemselves would much dislike the plan, and their desire to avoid it might assist him in his efforts to secure a compromise.     He hoped that it might help to promote a less uncompromising attitudeby the Owners when,  as he was trying to arrange,they met the Miners next week.The Cabinet took note of theverbal report by the Presidentof the Board of Trade, summarised above, and approved the general line of policy that he wasfollowing.(NOTE;- The President of the Board of Tradewithdrew at this point, in order tosee the Mineowners.)
GIVTL 4. The Cabinet had before them, a Most SecretSERVICERffivUNERA- Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerTIONft.26 (jn^lf-,(CP.-136 (32)) on the subject of Civil Service(previous Remuneration.Reference:Cabinet 50 The subject&quot; was discussed at some length,(31),  Con-oiusion 15.) titlt, the Cabinet felt that they could not reach final decisions until they had had the benefit of theviews of the Postmaster-General.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) To postpone their decision until their next regular weekly Meeting:(b) That in the meanwhile the secretary should be authorised to forward tothe Postmaster-General a copy ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sMemorandum (C tP .-136 (32)) andto invite him to attend the next meeting.
iyta^IONAL HEALTH 5, The Cabinet had before them the Report of aa^tp contributory pensions INSUR-   Cabinet Committee (C.P.-129 (32)) on the subject ofANOE ,National Health and Contributory Pensions Insurance,(Previous which had been before them at the Meeting referredReference:Cabinet 21 to in the margin, together with a Memorandum by the(32), 0on-clusion 5.) Minister of Health on the outstanding question off.t. Prolongation of Unemployed in Pensions InsuranceM(C.P.-133 (32)). In this Memorandum the Ministerof Health made a further proposal to meet the views expressed as to the desirability of doing everything possible to maintain the unemployed in insurance for pensions.   After re-stating the matter in theway in which he thought it should be presented inorder to recommend it to public opinion, he suggested the following conclusions:-&quot;A special period should beestablished in respect of the pension rights of the unemployed,long enough to enable us to actwith better knowledge of thepermanent state of employment, andof the solution of the problem ofunemployment insurance, but notbeyond the date when Parliament may desire to review the whole scheme in the light of the Report of theGovernment Actuary,During this period the rights ofthe tinemployed in respect of pensions should be stabilised, without prejudice to a final settlement.    I propose thatthis special period of stabilisation of pension rights should be a periodof three years from the end of thepresent year.    The three years wouldbe made up as follows.    One year (1933)with free med.ical benefit and pension rights, followed by one year (1934)with free pension rights, both partof my original proposal;    and afurther year (1935) with free pension rights, which I now propose to add.In&quot;the case of re-entry to employment at any time in the two latter years the qualifying conditions for HealthInsurance benefits to be the lapse of26 weeks, and the payment of 26contributions after re-entry, insteadof 104 weeks, and the payment of 104contribtitions as at present.The Bill would provide that at theend of these three years the situation
would revert to the position as originally proposed by me underwhich the unemployed receive amaximum of       years free insurance for pensions, and 2j free healthinsurance.    The contributory basis would thus be maintained at least in form and as a goal.    But itwould be the avowed purpose of theplan to provide time for considera-tion and to prevent loss of pensions to the unemployed unless and until we know it to be inevitable&quot; .^he Minister of Health was authorised by theSecretary of State for Scotland to say that heconcurred.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Health as quoted above .
