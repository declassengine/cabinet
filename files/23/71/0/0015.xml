IRAQ.THE SITUATIONIN REGARD TOTHE IRAQLEVIES.   .The Cabinet met for the purpose of consideringthe situation which has arisen in Iraq, in connectionwith the Assyrian Levies, and had before them(l) a Memorandum by the Colonial Office (paper cp, 204 (32)) circulated by direction of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, to which were attached four .telegrams which had recently passed between theBritish Authorities in Iraq and the Secretary of State;and (2) a Note covering two further telegrams receivedfrom Sir F.Humphrys since the Memorandum was drafted(Paper CP.  204.A (32)).The Cabinet were informed that early in thepresent month the Assyrian Levies, a force of two battalions paid for from Imperial funds, and employedin protecting the aerodromes in Iraq, had threatened to disband themselves at the end of June.     Theirexcuse for this action was that by agreeing to thetermination of the Iraq Mandate, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad failed to safeguard the interests of the Assyriannation.     To meet this subversive movement, it had beendecided by the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq to disband the force as a whole, and to retain only theloyal elements.      The movement was said to be part ofa plan to reunite the Assyrian nation, and the ultimate aim was a national migration, and in that Officer!view it was important that once disbanded, the Leviesshould be prevented from joining a threatenedconcentration of Assyrians in the North.     For
this purpose he had called for reinforcementsconsisting of one British Battalion and an Armoured CarSection, the Battalion to he despatched by air at short notice.    It was clear that these reinforcements were required, not to effect the actual dishandment of the levies which the British Authorities felt capable ofcarrying out with the forces at their disposal, but toprevent their joining their compatriots in NorthernIraq, after they had been disbanded and disarmed.Owing inter alia to the reduced forces at his disposal, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had felt unable to recommend the despatch of any reinforce-ments to Iraq without the authority of the Cabinet.&apos;The High Commissioner had been instructed toreport immediately the-outcome of an interview he wasto have with the Assyrian Leaders on June 13th, and his attention had been drawn by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to the deplorable political effect atGeneva and elsewhere, of sending British troops to Iraq,at this juncture.    These instructions had crossed atelegram from the High Commissioner emphasizing the seriousness of the situation, and repeating the opinionof the Air Officer Commanding as to the need for there infor cemen t s.In his latest telegrams (CP.  S04A(32))  the HighCommissioner stated that he had, from the first, been strongly opposed on general grounds to asking forreinforcements and would do his utmost to obviate thenecessity for them by effecting some temporary arrangements.    If, however, he failed to convince the assyrian Leaders and Officers at the Meeting on June13th, there seemed to him no alternative but to ask
for early reinforcements; but he would nothave their final decision until after anational Meeting at Amadia on June 15th.The leaders had expressed their determination not to live underMohammedan rule, and a plan not unlikely to he adopted was Assyrian concentration in the Dohuk-Amadia area for thepurpose of coercing the Governments ofGreat Britain and Iraq, into grantingthem an autonomous enclave.    This wouldcertainly lead to conflicts with theKurds, and very serious developments.The plan might, however, he frustratedif the Levies were kept from joining the concentration in the last resort by-disarming them, and retaining them in uniform under military law in theirstations.The British Authorities in Iraqwere reluctant to call in the assistanceof the Iraqi army, the bulk of which was engaged in the Barzan operations, though this step might have to be taken if itwas decided not to send British reinforcements.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR reported that hehad consulted with the Chief of the Imperial General Staffs the Quarter Master General and Sir-Webb Gillmanwho saw   very grave military objection to the reinforcementproposal.    Mid-June, to Mid-September was the hottest periodof the year in Iraq, and to bring in young and unseasonedtroops without the necessary preparations might wellresult in many casualties from heatstroke.     Moreover, thesuggestion that the Battalion should be divided into fourCompanies t-o be stationed many miles apart at Sulimaniyah,Diana, Mosul and Baghdad, in a roadless and hostile country,was inviting attacks by the Kurds which might inviolve adisaster, as it would be impracticable in the circumstances to reinforce the isolated Companies.      In this event alarge force would have to be despatched to retrieve theposition and to restore British prestige.In any case, the British troops would be unable toprevent the Assyrians from leaving the camps in driblets,and if drastic preventive measures were taken and the assyrians sustained casualties, there would be much adversecriticism.If the Cabinet decided that reinforcements must besent, the Military Authorities advised that a Brigade of four Battalions should be mobilized, but that the units should not be moved to Iraq before September.The Cabinet were also warned that the proposal was open to serious political objection. The despatch of aBritish Battalion would be regarded as decisive evidencethat Iraq was not yet fit to enter the League of Nations.
These Assyrian Christians were the remnants of the nationwhich had escaped massacre in Turkey.     As soon as the iraqi Army was withdrawn from the Baraan operations,the Kurds might &quot;be expected to attack the Assyriansettlements at Amadia.      If the Levies were allowed toreturn home, the Assyrians would be strong enough tobeat off the Kurds, but if we prevented concentrationwe should certainly be held responsible for any massacreof Assyrians that might occur.There was a close connection between the church of England and the Assyrian Church and the Assyrians, were entitled to look to the British Government to protect them from their hereditary enemies, the Kurds and Arabs,if necessary by assisting them to establish an autonomousenclave in Northern Iraq.     It was inconceivable that weshould import a British Battalion to prevent the men fromreturning to their homes, and if disbanded no steps shouldbe taken to interfere with their freedom of action in thisrespect, though it must be recognised that the decision might involve a serious outbreak between the Assyriansand the Kurds.On the other hand, it was pointed out that sir. Humphrys had never mentioned the climatic and other military objections to the proposal to bring in a British battalion.     He clearly shared the views of the AirForce Authorities as to the serious consequences of anAssyrian concentration at Amadia and the necessity for preventing the Levies from drifting home.     It was certain that Sir P, Humphrys would never have supported the proposal if he had thought that there was any real
substance in the objections to it which had been raised by the Military Authorities.     The suggestionthat the Assyrians should be encouraged in the matterof an autonomous enclave was deprecated.     Their claimshad been rejected by the Mandates Commission of theLeague after full inquiry, and it was generally agreedthat it would be very unwise to instruct Sir P. Humphrysto take any action in this direction without firsthearing his views.The Cabinet agreed, before, reaching a decision,to hear the views of the^Imperial General Staff and theChief of the Air Staff,who then entered the roomaccompanied by General Sir Webb Gillman.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF informed the Cabinetthat the Air Officer Commanding in, Iraq was satisfied(l) that adequate measures could be taken to protect the aerodromes if the Levies were disbanded and no British reinforcements were sent;    (2) that if the disbandedLevies were allowed to join their compatriots in NorthernIraq, fighting with the Kurds might be anticipated;    and(3) that the Iraqi Army would be incapable of dealing withan Assyrian-Kurdish conflict, without help from the AirForce.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF stated thatthe only places from which the proposed Battalion could besent were Palestine, Egypt and India.     He was advised thata Battalion could not at the moment be spared from palestine and that it would be difficult to spare one from egypt.     To reinforce from India would take longer than from Palestine or Egypt.
to rvStrong exception was always taken by the Government ofIndia to withdrawing troops from India for use in otherparts of the Empire.      To reinforce with aaWve troops from India would give rise to religious and other difficulties, whether the troops were Mohammedan or Hindu.Sir George Milne warned the Cabinet that the Army MedicalAuthorities were emphatically opposed, on health grounds,to moving a Battalion to Iraq, in the hot season and read a Note by the Director General of Army Medical Services,for the terms of which see Appendix I.      He explained indetail the grave military objections to the proposedscattering of a Battalion of young and inexperienced troopsover the large unsettled and roadless area.&amp;THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF observed that the personnel$ ^GENERAL GILLMAN    said that, from his personalexperience, he could confirm what the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff had saidregarding the inadvisability, on grounds ofhealth, of moving troops to Iraq in thehot season41&quot;.Palestine.      He admittea, however, xu.that Air Force personnel was always sent to Iraq in thecool weather in order to get acclimatized,and never at theopening of the hot season.     If it was decided not to sendreinforcements, the Levies could not be prevented fromrejoining their compatriots and he had suggested that theymight be allowed to go on leave without their arms and with-out having been disbanded.     The Assyrian leaders would notbe satisfied with a compromise which was suggested at theMeeting, namely that 600 of the Levies should be disbandedand allowed to go home on condition that the remainingLevies returned to duty.The Chief of the Imperial General. Staff, theChief of the Air Staff and General Sir WebbGillman then withdrew from the Meeting.
2-8-9Strong exception was always taken Toy the Government ofIndia to withdrawing troops from India for use in otherparts of the Empire.      To reinforce with na*9rve troops from India would give rise to religious and other difficulties, whether the troops were Mohammedan or Hindu.Sir George Milne warned the Cabinet that the Army MedicalAuthorities were emphatically opposed, on health grounds,to moving a Battalion to Iraq in the hot season and read a Note by the Director General of Army Medical Services,for the terms of which see Appendix I.      He explained indetail the grave military objections to the proposedscattering of a Battalion of young and inexperienced troopsover the large unsettled and roadless area.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF observed that the personnel of the Air Force did not suffer in Iraq in the hot weather,and that the climatic conditions of places like Sulimaniyahand Diana were not much different from those of Egypt and palestine.      He admitted, however, in answer to a question,that&apos;Air Force personnel was always sent to Iraq in thecool weather in order to get acclimatized,and never at theopening of the hot season.     If it was decided not to sendreinforcements, the Levies could not be prevented fromrejoining their compatriots and he had suggested that theymight be allowed to go on leave without their arms and with-out having been disbanded.

After further discussion, in the course of whichit was generally accepted that in view of the politicaland military (climatic and strategic) objections, the reinforcement proposal was not one that could &quot;be entertained, the Cabinet agreed :-That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised to communicateforthwith to the High Commissioner,by telegram, the conclusions reached by theCabinet -(1) That as a matter of principle theCabinet were unable to sanction theuse of British or other imperial forces to disarm or intern the assyrian Levies;(2) That even if the Cabinet had approved the proposal in principle it wouldbe impracticable to send a British battalion from Egypt in view of the risks involved in moving unseasonedtroops during the hot weather;(3) That the use of Native troops from india would be open to most serious objection on political and religiousgrounds.(4) That the proposal that the AssyrianLevies should be interned after dis-bandment was not one that could be entertained.    The Levies, whendisbanded, must be free to return totheir homes.(5) That in taking the decision in (4)above, the Cabinet recognised therisk of conflict between Assyriansand Kurds but considered that in allthe circumstances it would be unjust andindefensible to intern men who hadbeen disbanded.NOTE.      Immediately after the Meeting of the Cabinetthe Secretary of State for the Coloniesdespatched a telegram to Sir F. Humphrys,for the terms of which see Appendix IIA copy of this telegram was at the sametime sent to the Air Ministry.      &apos; -S,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.13th June, 1932.
APPENDIX      I.NOTE BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF ARMY MEDICAL SERVICES.I do not consider it possible to send a battalion of young soldiers from Egypt to Mesopotamia to &quot;be scatteredin small detachments at this time of the year without grave risk of disaster from sickness.In order to make such a move possible the most thorough and elaborate precautions in the matter of housing, food, watersupply, etc. would have to be taken beforehand and be readyon arrival of the troops.      In addition, special arrangementsfor the protection of the troops from heat-stroke and thetreatment of such cases,and their evacuation to suitablehospitals would have to be made.(Sgd.) H.B. FAWCUS.D.J.A.M.S.War Office,13th June, 193S
APPENDIX II.TELEGRAM PROM THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THECOLONIES TO THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR IRAQ.Immediate.

Cabinet are advised that climatic risks to unseasonedtroops available there would be very serious.3. w&quot;e cannot agree to proposal that Assyriansshould be interned after disbandment.
