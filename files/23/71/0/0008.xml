THE INTER-MATIONALLABOUROFFICE.(previous reference:Cabinet SI(32), Con-conclusion ion 9.)fA.I. The Minister of Labour mentioned the questionof the vacancy in the post of Director of the Inter-national Labour Office caused by the sudden death of M. Albert Thomas.   The appointment of a successorlay with the Governing Body, of which the Ministerof Labour was a member.    In view of the fact that sir Eric Drummond had let it be known that he intendedto resign the post of Secretary-General to theLeague of Nations,at the end of the present year,he thought it might be convenient if the post of director of the International Labour Office werenot filled at the moment, so that the two appoint-ments could be considered together in the Autumn.It appeared very unlikely that an English candidatecould be appointed to both vacancies, and for that reason it might be better that the appointmentsshould be considered together.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ratherinclined to the Minister of Labour&apos;a view, but saidthat he would like to discuss the matter in the firstinstance with the Secretary-General to the League ofNations, at Geneva.
RUSSIANPROPAGANDA.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(32), Con-clusion 10.)arising out ofan article in&quot;InternationalPress Co^responri-ence&quot; o^ March 10,2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(C.P.-154 (32)) raising the question of RussianPropaganda, on which a Question had been put down for answer in the House of Commons on May 11th,In this Memorandum the Secretary of State asked theadvice of his colleagues on the following three possible courses of action:-(a) To protest to the Soviet Governmentand to receive the certain answer that the Soviet Government have no responsibility for the pronounce-ments either of the Communist party of India or of the Communist Inter-national ,(b) To protest against the publicationnow in question (i,e,, an article in &quot;International Press Correspond-ence&quot; of March 10, 1932, the organof the Communist International,advocating armed insurrection inIndia) and, in default of satisfac-tion, to continue pressing ourprotest in this and similar casesup to the point at which a severanceof diplomatic relations may becomeunavoidable.(c) To ignore the present and similarfuture publications.The trend of the discussion went to show thatthe subject of Russian propaganda was closely linked up- with the larger question of trade relations withRussia, which is now before a Cabinet Committee,and it was felt that no final decision could betaken on either question in isolation.The Cabinet agreed  . (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should give a reply to the following effect&quot;The article has been consideredby His Majesty&apos;s Government inconnection with the undertakingrelative to propaganda givenby the Soviet Government inDecember, 1929..   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are of opinionthat the Soviet Government andthe Communist International-2-
cannot be dissociated in thesematters.   I propose to take anearly opportunity of speaking to the Soviet representative on the subject,&quot;(b) That the Cabinet Committee on Tradewith Russia should be asked to report as soon as possible, and that thequestion of propaganda should thenbe further considered.
INDIA.Leader of theOpposition^Interview .(previous reference:Cabinet 26(33), Con-clusion 11P-R.-12 [3St In the course of the discussion on the preceding -ing item of business the attention of the cabinet was invited to an interview given to an Indian news-paper by the Leader of the Opposition.   This interview,it was pointed out, was not only an encouragement to the attitude of resistance to the Government&apos;policy in India, but was a serious breach of thesincere efforts made for some years by the variouspolitical Parties in this country to withdraw IndianPolicy from Party controversy.   A suggestion was made that the Secretary of State for India should make astatement in the House of Commons on the subject,either by Question and Answer or in Debate, and thathe should make perfectly clear that the Leader of theOpposition&apos;s statement was not in accord with thepolicy of the Government.The Secretary of State for Indiaundertook to consider the proposal.
THE IRISH 4. The Cabinet had before them the followingFREE STATE .documents relating to the situation in the Irish(previous Free state, arising more particularly out of the reference:Cabinet 26 Oath Bill now before the Dail:-(32), Con-elusion 3.) The draft Conclusions of the 4th Meetingof the Irish Situation Committee (CP.-156f.R. (32)), the main recommendations of whichare as follows:-(1) That the policy of the United kingdom should be based on the view that Mr de valera, by securing the passage of the oath Bill, has not yet put the IrishFree State out of the British Common-wealth, but that,while remainingwithin the Commonwealth,  the IrishFree State have broken the Treaty.(2) On this assumption, to adopt the policysuggested by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs in I.S.0.(32) 16,paragraph 4 (l), namely&quot;To indicate that as the IrishFree State have shown their intention to disregard theirexisting engagements,  it isimpossible for the UnitedKingdom to enter into freshengagements with them or even to discuss with them the negotiation of such freshengagements&quot;.(3) That this policy should be announced in the House of Commons before the oath Bill leaves the Dail, by meansof a Question and Answer to be basedon the drafts read to the committee by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,(4) That no decision should be taken withregard to the&quot; question of furthersanctions pending the result of theabove declaration by the UnitedKingdom Government, on the understand-ing, however, that a decision withregard to the action to be taken inthe event of the withholding in Junenext of the instalment of the LandPurchase Annuities should be reached. well in advance of the date on whichthe payment falls due to be made.A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs (CP.^157 (32)),  circxilat-ing for consideration of the Cabinet a proposed Question and Answer prepared onthe lines suggested in recommendation(3) above, as follows
Q.UEST10N:   Whether, if the Bill to abolish the Oath is passed by theIrish Free State Parliament, it isthe intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to enter into negotiationswith the Irish Free State Governmentwith a view to preventing the ad valoremand additional Duties becoming operativeagainst the Irish Free State on the15th November tinder the Import DutiesAct.ANSWER: His Majesty&apos;s Government havealready expressed the view that the declared intention of the Irish FreeState Government   as set out in theBill to abolish the Oath is in directdisregard of their obligations underthe Treaty of 1921.   It appears toHis Majesty&apos;s Government that if theBill becomes law it would be unreason-able to expect that they should enterinto negotiations for further agree-ments with a Government which had thusrepudiated an Agreement already enteredinto.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that he had received a communi-cation from the High Commissioner of Ireland in london to the effect that Mr de Valera had authorised himto discuss the question of Tariffs and suggesting ameeting the same afternoon on the subject.   TheSecretary of State had felt it necessary to refuseto meet that day, in view of the Answer which he wasexpecting to give in the House of Commons, if theCabinet approved.The Cabinet approved the policy of the CabinetCommittee, as set forth above, and agreed  (a) To approve the Question suggested bythe Secretary of State for DominionAffairs in CP.-157 (32) and setforth above- but that the answer should be amended (by alteration ofthe first sentence) to read asfollows&quot;ANSWER. The provisions containedin this Bill- are in direct conflict with the obligations undertaken by .the Irish Free State under theTreaty of 1921.    It appears toHis Majesty&apos;s Government that ifthe Bill becomes law it would be unreasonable to expect that they
1 o 3should enter into negotiationsfor further Agreements with aGovernment which had thusrepudiated an Agreement alreadyentered into&quot;,(b) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should immediately inform theDominions by telegram of the above statement.
IS ARMAMENTlv Policy.previous reference:Cabinet 26(33), Con-elusion 2 .)a5. The Cabinet had before them a Report by aSub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial defence on the subject of Air Disarmament Policy (C.P.-152(32)), the recommendations of which are summarised in the last paragraph as follows:-(i) The proposed prohibition of the act of bombing on the territory and shipping of another sovereign Statepossesses considerable disadvantagesfrom the point of view of imperialdefence generally, and. decisive disad-vantages from that of the defence ofLondon and other objectives to air attack in the United Kingdom.   We donot recommend that the United kingdom delegation at the Disarmament Confer-ence should be authorised to make this proposal,(ii) We recommend that the United kingdom delegation at Geneva should be author-is ed to propose the restriction of aircraft, other than civilian aircraft,to the weight proposed by the Chiefof the Air Staff, namely, 11,000 poundsunloaded weight, as specified in para-graph 21, and footnote to paragraph 23,The Lord President of the Council explained thatthe Committee had had to complete its Report in rather a short time;   consequently they had not been ableto see representatives of the Admiralty and War Office.The subject of their Report, however, mainly concerned,the Air Ministry, and he did not think the general conclusion would have been affected by the hearing of Naval and Military evidence.Although the Committee&apos;s reasons for rejecting the proposed prohibition of the act of bombing onthe territory and shipping of another sovereign Statewere neither challenged nor criticised, considerabledisappointment was expressed at the comparativemeagreness of the contribution that it was proposedto offer to aerial disarmament.   It was not contestedthat the proposal to restrict military aircraft to11,000 lbs. unloaded weight was a measure of limita-tion.comparable to some extent with our other
proposals on qualitative disarmament, but it waspointed out that it did not involve any seriousreduction in Air armaments, more especially as we ourselves only possessed five machines of the weightsuggested.     There was considerable recognition also of the difficult position in which the members ofthe United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva would beplaced if they found themselves compelled to oppose the prohibition of bombing unless they had some more substantial constructive proposal to offer.On the other hand it was suggested that,  in viewof the extent to which the United Kingdom hadalready disarmed generally as compared withContinental nations,  the proposal was by no means a negligible one;    particularly as, with theexception of the five machines mentioned above,the large bombers at present in the Air force were obsolescent and due to be replaced by aircraft of the type it was proposed to surrender..Moreover, if this proposal was accepted it would prevent the development of the &quot;battleship&quot;type of heavy bombers for all time.      The Secretaryof State for Air urged, as he had done at theprevious Meeting of the Cabinet,  the importanceof getting the Conference down to the practicalaspects of disarmament.A proposal was made to supplement theCommitteefs recommendations by supporting the
prohibition of bombardment from the air ofthe civil population, as advocated at the.International Conference by six Delegations,including the Japanese and American.      Thissuggestion met with a favourable receptionby the Cabinet.The Cabinet were reminded that a draftConvention upon the Revision of the Rules of warfare had been drawn up by a Committee ofJurists at The Hague in the year 1923(C.I.D. Paper No. 418-B), which dealt,inter alia, with the question of bombing,though not in a very convincing manner.Moreover,  the Convention had never been ratified.-9A-.
It was recalled that under conditions of modernwarfare the problem of separating military objectives for bombing from the civil population presentedalmost insuperable, difficulties, but there was astrong sentiment that the subject was one thatdeserved further exploration.The comparative ineffectiveness of the various proposals for Air disarmament that had been made tothe Cabinet led to a reopening of proposals of widerscope that had been made by the Lord President of theCouncil at the previous Meeting, in favour of theentire suppression of military and naval air forces,combined with restriction on civil aviation!    forexample, by cutting off subsidies.   The Secretaryof State for Air warned the Cabinet that largeproposals of this hind were not likely to contribute to progress at Geneva, but there was almost generalagreement in the principle of the Lord Presidenfsconception, and. the Cabinet felt the subject oughtto be further explored.The Lord. President of the Council pointed out theextent to which the various forms of disarmament were linked together.    For example, the size of capital ships depended to a great extent on the necessityfor protecting them against Submarines and airbombers.   The Italians refused to abolish Submarinesunless Capital Ships were also abolished.    If,therefore,  It was possible, by abolishing militaryand naval aircraft, to -make an offer greatly toreduce the size of Capital Ships in return for theabolition of Submarines,  great results mightbe     achieved.    A reduction in the size of theCapital Ship would affect coast defences and the size of new docks, and if Submarines were abolished
he gathered that the abolition of the laying of contact mines in the open sea wotild also be acceptable to the Navy.    His proposal opened upprospects of great economies at a time when theworld could not afford their existing expenditure,and he thought the time was not far distant when thenations might be willing to listen to such proposals the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that if the above proposal were to besubmitted to the Disarmament Conference the best plan might be to circulate it in the form of aMemorandum, rather than to announce the policy ina speech.    This course had been followed from timeto time by the French and other Delegations.    Theproposal could be further developed later on byspeech.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Report of the Cabinet ,Committee; 6-^6 -^uJ^i^t     ytfa- ^^0-^.^:(b) That the Lord President of the Counciland the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in consultation with theMinisters at the head of the defence services, and with the collaboration of the Secretary to the Cabinet,should draw up, for the considerationof their colleagues, a Memorandum setting forth, from the point of view of Disarma-ment as a whole, the proposal of theLord President of the Council for theabolition of Naval and Military aviation and the restriction of Civil Aviation.The Memorandum should be drawn up in a form in which it could be presented,if the Cabinet should so decide, to theDis armament C onferenc e.
^ rIL SERVICEREMUNERATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(32), Con-elusion 4.)2^39 if.6. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Civil Service Remunera-tion:-A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP.-156 (32)), whichhad been before them at the two previous meetings:A Note by the Secretary (CP.-151 (32))containing a Cabinet decision takenlast August by the Labour Government(Cabinet 41 (31), Conclusion 5),allowing the Civil Servants concerned to treat the reduction of 5 per cent.in the cost-of-living bonus last september as their contribution tothe national emergency;   togetherwith particulars as to the form inwhich the Treasury had communicatedthat decision to the Civil Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthe Cabinet should authorise Sir Warren Fisher andSir Horace Wilson to engage in conversation of anon-official character with some of the leaders ofthe Staff side of the Whitley Council.    They should explain that although a fair proposition had been offered to the Staff side, it had not proved accept-able because the moment selected and the basic rateproposed for consolidation of pay had been criticised as too favourable to the Exchequer.    In these circum-stances these two Officers would be permitted to add that the Government, while insisting on the principleof consolidation, were willing to postpone its intro-duction until the end of March.    In that finalconsolidation the cost of living would be one ofthe factors, but not the only factor to be takeninto consideration.    In putting the position beforethe Staff side it would&apos;have to be made clear thatthe present system must continue until March, withall its  implications,  including a possible reductionif the cost of living fell in September.-IS-
The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Chancellor of the exchequer that an unofficial conversation, onthe above lines, should be authorised.
NATIONAL POWERAND&apos; TRANSPORT .(previous reference:Cabinet 18(33), Con-elusion 3.)3o(5^)lit.7. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (CP.-150 (32)) covering a document that had been handed to him by a deputation from the National Union of Railwaymen, the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and theRailway Clerks Association, on the subject of thefuture organisation of transport in this country.The Memorandum enclosed dealt with the competition between the four railway groups, as well as with therelationships between road and rail, and advocatedthe formation of a Public Transport Board chargedwith the operation of railway and road motor under-takings and clothed with power to acquire and operateinland navigation, coastal steamboat services and air transport.   The recommendation of the Minister ofTransport was that he should be authorised to replyto the effect that the Government had taken note ofthe views of the Railway Unions, and, while notprepared to adopt the particular methods of consolida-tion of transport on the lines advocated by theDeputation, appreciated the importance which theRailway Unions attached to the continued existenceof our railways in an efficient and. prosperouscondit ion.The Cabinet approved the recommendation &apos;of the Minister of Transport, as setforth above, and desired him to makequite clear that his answer must notbe interpreted as favouring national!-,sation.
8.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C.P.-158 (32)) dealing, as requested by the Cabinet at the Meeting referredto in the margin, with the question still outstand-ing on the Sunday Entertainments Bill;    that is tosay, as to the procedure to be adopted by LocalAuthorities which have not hitherto permittedSunday opening of cinemas but which may wish to doso in future.The Home Secretary&apos;s suggestion was that such provisions of the Private Bill procedure as areantecedent to the application to Parliament shouldbe retained.   Boroughs and Urban Councils desiringthat an Order should be made would have to take theusual steps of a Town Meeting, followed, ifnecessary, by a poll of the ratepayers;    while in rural districts, if objection was raised, theapplication would have to be preceded by an Inquiryordered by the Secretary of State.    If the poll ofthe ratepayers or the finding of the Inquiry was infavour of the proposed Order, then&apos; it would besubmitted to the Secretary of State, who would layit before Parliament.   The Order would not become operative unt-    it had been affirmatively approvedby Resolution of both Houses.   The Home Secretaryasked the authority of the Cabinet to introduce theBill, including a provision on the above lines,subject to any drafting or other minor amendments which further examination of its provisions mightshow to be necessary.A draft of the Sunday Entertainments Bill, 1932,was handed round during the Meeting of the Cabinet.
The Home Secretary undertook to consider the modification of paragraph 9 of the Schedule, whichthe Secretary of State for far, as Leader of the Houseof Lords, advised would be resented in the House ofLords and appeared unnecessary.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Home Secretary, as set forth in CP. 158 (32) and summarised above,and authorised the introduction of- the Bill.

It was arranged that the following ministers should be present at the Requiem Service forPresident Doumer:-The Lord President of the Council,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for Air,The President of the Board ofEducation.

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that it was customary to give a Dinnerat the Foreign Office on The King&apos;s Birthday forthe whole of the Diplomatic Corps.      In the previous year,  when economy had been a very urgent question,it had nevertheless been decided to hold the Dinner.He would be glad if those of his colleagues towhom it was convenient would keep free the datenow proposed, Friday, June jjrd.The Cabinet agreed -That the usual Dinner to the diplomatic Corps should takeplace on The King&apos;s Birthday.-1 8-

The Home Secretary drew the attention of theCabinet to the recent announcement of a modification in the Silk Duties.      This followed on decisionswithout consultation with the Cabinet .takeh inrespect of the Import duties Aot^and as to there being no negotiations with foreign countries on tariffs until after Ottawa.     He did not wish todiscuss on merits the decision on Silk Duties, as this was one of the subjects on which the ordinaryrule of Cabinet collective responsibility had beenwaived, and he only mentioned the question as oneof procedure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explainedthat from the first he had contemplated the possibilityof some modification in the proposed Silk Duties.He had not, however, discussed the matter in detail with the officials of his Department until after the lastregular weekly meeting of the Cabinet.      Consequentlyhe would not have been in a position to lay aproposal before the Cabinet or to do more than to saythat he was proposing some modification.      He hadnot thought it was a question on which the cabinet would wish to be consulted.In reply to a question he explained thathe proposed to consult the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee unofficially and to obtain their unofficialadvice, as  to a more permanent policy, but in the meanwhile he had made the announcement referred to.-1 9-
12.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that the late Government had sent out an expert,Mr. French,  to report on developments in Palestinegenerally, and more particularly on the positionof landless Arabs.      It had always been contemplated that when a Report was ready it would be shown tofirstthe Jewish and Arab Bureaux.    Mr. French&apos;s/Report hadnot been altogether satisfactory.      It had been necessary to ask him to exclude certain passagesthat were likely to cause friction, although unfortunatelysome of these had leaked out in Palestine at an early stage.     Even after these excisions the Report was opento the objection that it lacked precision,     Mr. french had consequently been asked to furnish a second Report.This he had now done, and it was a very fair though nothopeful document,  in which a&apos;good deal of stress was laid on the very limited amount of land available,  andon the difficulties of continuing to develop the cultivation of oranges without ensuring a market. ^The Secretary of State did not wish to publish theReports until he could announce the Government&apos;s policy.He had suggested to the High Commissioner that the Reports.should be sent to the Jewish and Arab Agencies as a confidential document, and published later, when theCabinet could announce their policy.      He felthe would have to be guided in this matter by theHigh Commissioner,  from whom as yet he had received no reply.      He wished however,  to have the support ofthe Cabinet if he with-held publication until hecould announce the policy.The Cabinet approved the above proposal.
