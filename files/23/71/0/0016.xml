IRAQ.SITUATION INREGARD TOTHE IRAQLEVIES.(previousReferenceCabinet34 (32)).1. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIESread to the Cabinet a telegram from the HighCommissioner of Iraq (Appendix I) which had crossed the Secretary of state&apos;s telegram of the13th June to the High Commissioner (Appendix ii of the Conclusions referred to in the margin).It seemed probable that the meeting at Amadia ofthe 15th June would decide in favour of disbandment:that the Levies would then march to rejoin theircompatriots, and that a conflict with the Kurdsmight then well take place.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR read to theCabinet two telegrams which he had received fromthe Air Officer Commanding in Iraq (Appendix II).With the approval of the Lord President of theCouncil, the Secretary of State for Air had authorised the despatch from: Egypt to Iraq of 100Royal Air Force reliefs.     The Cabinet were also informed that an Armoured Car Section had beensent from Palestine to Iraq.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, who had been unableto be present at the meeting of the Cabinet on the13th June, stated that he was in full agreementwith the conclusions reached by the Cabinet on that occasion.The Cabinet approved the action whichhad been taken with regard to thedespatch from Egypt to Iraq of ICORoyal Air Force reliefs.
2o &quot; THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA informed the   .Cabinet that very important discussions had takenplace in the Committee on India, and that a point had now been reached when the Cabinet would have to takepossibly the most important decisions in regard toIndia which any British G-overnment had taken for manyyears.The three Committees had all returned from india, two of them had reported,  and the third was expected to report shortly.      The preparatory work undertaken by these Committees had beenquickly, efficiently, and,on the whole, satisfactorilycarried out.     All the Committees had made the best possible impression on Indians of all classes.Within the next few weeks the Cabinet wouldbe called upon to take decisions on three questions ofthe highest importance, relating to (l) the Ordinancesj(2) the Communal question; and (3) the future constitutional programme.The Ordinances, promulgated to deal with thecivil disobedience movement in India, are due to expireon the 3rd July next.     After consultation with thePrime Minister, he (the Secretary of.State) had invited the Government of India and the Provincial governments to furnish him with reports as to what should be donewhen the Ordinances expired.     This action had beentaken in view of the undesirability of the Cabinetbeing faced at the end of June with having to take an urgent decision on possibly very inadequate data.
The Government of India and the Provincial governments had now reported (Papers CP. 184 (32) and CP.  202(32))and without exception were in favour of taking againsubstantially the same emergency powers as had been inforce during the last six months.    In regard toprocedure,  it was proposed to issue one consolidatedOrdinance In place of the separate Ordinances.    Whilethe new Ordinance would contain practically all theexisting emergency powers, it would be left to thevarious Provinces to apply the Ordinance,  if required,either throughout the Province or only to those districts where It is necessary.    The Ordinances had been designed to deal with the civil disobedience movement and with terrorism.   With regard to the former, theOrdinances had, on the whole, been successful, and inview of the Provincial Governors it was a mistake to think that the civil disobedience movement had merelybeen driven underground.    It was true, of course,  thatbitter opponents resented the Ordinances, but the general public in India, and particularly the inhabitants of thecountry districts, had been greatly relieved by the actionof the Government in resorting to the special powers whichthe Ordinances provided, while the politicians had disclaimedany responsibility and had attempted to remain neutral.With regard to terrorism,  there was no doubt that action under the Ordinances was making a distinct impression in Bengal.    The eradication of this particular evilmust, however,   take a long time, but the new Governor of bengal (Sir John Anderson) was satisfied that in time
the forces of order would prevail.   For the time being,however, it was absolutely essential that the present emergency powers should be retained.    If suspects andother terrorists, who could not be brought to trial,were released,  the morale of the police would be brokenand all friends of the Government in India would loseheart.    Sir John Anderson was very emphatic that the terrorist provisions of the Ordinance must be retained.The Law Officers had advised that the emergencyat the end of June could be distinguished from theemergency existing on the 4th January last, and that itwas therefore within the legal powers of the Governor GeneralOf India to issue a fresh Ordinance, either previous to,or simultaneous with,  the expiry of the existing Ordinances.XVwas possible that this opinion might be challenged intb.$ Indian Courts and he (the Secretary of State) was inconjmunication with the Government of India on the matter.With the full concurrence of the Committee on India and ofthe Prime Minister he (the Secretary of State) had telegraphed on the 10th June his acceptance of theGovernment of India&apos;s Ordinance proposals.fbomiRunal Ever since the Prime Minister&apos;s speech at the11 ion.close of the Second Round Table Conference on the 1stDecember, 1931,   the understanding had been that theGovernment would,  if necessary, give a decision on the Communalquestion in the summer of 193S.    It was indeed most desirable in the view of the Government of India that, if possible,this decision should be given by the end of July next.
The preparation of the material on which to base thedecision had been expedited, and this material coverednot only the Hindus and the Moslems, but also thedepressed classes.    The Provincial Governments had been invited to advise how best the problem could be dealtwith, and it was expected that all the replies would bereceived within a very short time.    The Governors in the;:two Provinces (the Punjab and Bengal) where the issue was    i- . jmost acute, did not take an alarmist view of the effectof the decision.tThe Secretary of State said that he, personally,was not so anxious in regard to the Hindu-Moslem aspect of the question as in regard to the depressed classesaspect.    The depressed classes constituted an entirely new problem.   For the first time these classes wereemerging as a conscious political force.    It was,however, very difficult to find a satisfactorydefinition of a number of these classes, and this was soparticularly in Northern India.    The Cabinet must realise that-this was a most difficult and most important question.In the absence of the receipt of final data from theGovernment of India he (the Secretary of State) could not ask for any definite decision at the moment, and itmight be five or six weeks before the Cabinet would becalled upon to give a decision.   As at present advised,however,  it would seem best to restrict the decision tothe barest minimum sufficient for the purposes of settlingcommunal proportions in the Provincial and Central-Legislatures; and not to extend it at present at all events so as to cover e.g. communal proportions in thevarious branches of the public service.    It would probably
be wise to announce that the decision was the final wordof the British Government and would be incorporated inthe proposed legislation, subject, however,  to this:  that ifif between the time when the decision was announced andthe date of the introduction of the measure all the interested communities presented the Government with an agreed settlement of their own,  that settlement might besubstituted for the Government&apos;s decision.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would, however, take no further part at allin any more negotiations between Indians.    It was also important that the Communal decision should be a decisionof the whole Government and not in form a decision of thePrime Minister alone.THE SECRETARY OP STATE said that the future:tutionalamme. Constitutional Programme had been most carefullyargued for many months.   At the outset he had taken the view that the wisest course would be to start with a Provincial Autonomy measure, and to leave thequestion of the Federal Centre to be dealt with in subsequent legislation.    The more he had examined thequestion the more difficult had it seemed to be toproceed by way of two separate Bills.    It was certain thatif this course was adopted the Hindus generally would bevery suspicious, and in some Provinces would be sosuspicious that they would withhold all co-operation.Whatever the Moslems might say in y^ubli^ they would attheir conferences make much the same claim as the Hindus,viz. a demand for a single Bill.    From the home point ofview there was the great practical difficulty of introducingand passing into law two Government of India Bills in the life-time of a single Parliament.    It was thought atfirst that a Provincial Autonomy Bill might be ashort and comparatively simple measure:    it was found,however, that the Bill would have- to be a very-6-
complicated one containing possibly as many as seventyclauses.    If a Provincial Autonomy Bill was introducednext year most of the session would be devoted to a highly controversial measure, and it was difficult tobelieve that the present Parliament would be preparedto face a second Government of India Bill in thesessions of 1934 or 1935.For these reasons he (the Secretary of State) had reached the conclusion that it would be necessary to try to proceed by means of a single Bill,    He usedthis expression intentionally,  as no specific pledgecould be given on the subject because certain data wasnot available and the Government had no control over it.A single Bill pre-supposed the practicability of all-Indiafederation.    This, in turn, involved the acceptance bya sufficient number of the more important princes ofthe scheme.    The probability was that the Princes would eventually acquiesce in the arrangements, and everyeffort was being made to bring to a conclusion the issueso far as the Princes were concerned.    There also,however,  remained the other outstanding questions, andnotably the problem of the safeguards.There remained the question of the procedure to befollowed on the assumption that the Government would proceed by means of a single Bill.   After long discussionwith the Government of India, substantial agreement had now been reached.    Some time ago the Government of india were inclined to favour a further meeting of the RoundTable Conference, and in any case a further meeting ofthe Federal Structure Committee.    The Committee on India,which included the Prime Minister,  the Lord Chancellor and himself, were unanimously of opinion, however, that furtherformal meetings must be avoided if progress was to b.-7-
made.    These meetings not only produced no agreement,hut they tended to emphasize differences.    The betterprocedure would be to announce that the time had now cometo take definite decisions, but that this did not mean inthe least that co-operation between the Government andIndians was to cease.    It would be open to the Viceroy tomake more use of the Consultative Committee, and the homeGovernment could invite selected representative Indians todiscuss informally and confidentially in London such questions as the position of the States in the federalstructure, and the proposed safeguards.    The Prime Ministerand the Committee on India also agreed that Indian co-operation should be provided for by means of associatingIndians with a Joint Select Committee of both Houses.    this procedure had been followed In the case of the lastimportant Government of India Bill.    The more formaldiscussions would take place at this stage; it being, ofcourse, clearly understood that the Indians would not be members of the Joint Select Committee, but would be present as assessors.    Under this procedure both the Round table conference and the Legislative Assembly would be able effect-ively to represent their views to the Joint Select Committee.On the previous occasion the Government of India   bill was considered by the Joint Select Committee after the secondreading debate; there was much to be said in the present case for adopting the procedure originally contemplated for deal-ing with the Report of the Simon Commission and employing aJoint Select Committee before any Bill had been actuallyintroduced.    In this way the Government could present theJoint Select Committee with a draft Bill, and not with ameasure the structure of which had been determined bythe second reading.     A Bill recommended for secondreading by the Joint Select Committee would have avery much better chance of acceptance in tho-8-
tement      House of Commons.    In conclusion the Secretary of Statelament,   for India informed the Cabinet that he was very anxiousto make a statement in the House of Commons within thenext fortnight, dealing in broad outline with the generalintentions of the Government.    A preliminary draft ofthis statement had been prepared.    It was contemplated that the statement would announce that the government intended to proceed on the basis of a single Bill providingalike for the autonomous constitutions of the provinces and for the federation of Provinces and States! and atthe same time to make it plain that the decision tocomplete the structure (which involved the Government&apos;ssatisfying themselves that various difficulties, especially those connected with safeguards and with the acceptanceof federation by the Princes, could readily be met) mustpreclude fixing at present a time for the introductionof the Bill.   Reference would be made to the Government&apos;forthcoming decision on the Communal problem and theirviews on the continuance of co-operation with Indians inthe work of framing the new constitution.    The statement would conclude by announcing that a single consolidatedOrdinance was about to be promulgated.In reply to the Lord President of the Council theSECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said that he desired animmediate decision on the question of the Ordinance; thata decision on the statement to be made in the House ofCommons would be required next week, and that adecision on the Communal question should be given beforethe end of July.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, on behalf of the  Cabinetthanked the Secretary of State for India for his most valuable and well-informed statement.-9-

The Cabinet were reminded that a Joint Select    ^Committee never issues or reveals a minority report,and it was suggested that in drafting the statement asto Indian co-operation in the    Joint Select Committeethe Parliamentary precedents should be carefully examined with a view to seeing whether the proposed procedurecould, in fact, be worked, especially in the novelcircumstances of enquiry by a Joint Select committee before the second reading of the Bill.    THE Secretary Of STATE FOR INDIA assured the Cabinet that he did not propose to use the word * assessor&apos; in his statement.He would make It clear that the Indians would have fullopportunities of stating their case without definingprecisely how this would be done.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR warned the Cabinetthat the House of Lords would probably be much morecritical of a progressive policy in India than the Houseof Commons.   He recalled that the Government had only beenable in December last to carry in that House the resolution in favour of the Indian Policy (Command Paper 3972) by giv-ing very definite assurances that in voting for that policy the.members of the House of Lords were not committing themselvesto any scheme at all, or pledging themselves to supportany Bill when it came before the House.    Great difficulties might be anticipated in regard to the sufficiency of the safeguards, and it was certain that the Irish precedentwould be quoted against the Government.    He hoped thatthe Secretary of State for India would not go beyond theGovernment&apos;s existing commitments.    He entirely favoured the proposal tot ake the Joint Select Committee stagebefore the second reading of the Bill.   He also agreed thatthe Bill should deal with both Provincial Autonomy and theFederal Structure problem, if a satisfactory solution ofthat problem could be found.-10-
3 .C  a   o o   0THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he wasin full agreement with the views of the Secretary ofState for War.The Secretary of State for India reportedto the Cabinet that the Viceroy and the Governor of bengal were dissatisfied with the system by which of Penal Servitude (as distinguished from followersof the1 Civil Disobedience movement) were confinedin gaols and camps situated in their own provinces,where It was impossible to deprive them of allopporturTities&quot;of^^propaganda?     It was proposed to resume the practice of transporting such prisoners tothe Andaman Islands.      The question had been consideredby the Committee on India, which had recorded their agreement in the Government of India&apos;s proposal, withwhich the. Prime Minister had also expressed hisconcurrence.The Committee agreed :  (l) To take note of and approve theaction of the Secretary of Statefor India in accepting -&quot;with-   the concurrence of the Committeeon India - the proposals of theGovernment of India respecting the new Ordinance.(2) To note with approval the proposal of the Government of India to resume the practice of transportingconvicted terrorist prisoners,sentenced to long terms of penal servitude, to the Andaman Islands.(3) To request the Secretary of State forIndia to -arrange for the circulation to the Cabinet at an early date ofhis draft statement of policy, witha view to the statement beingconsidered by the Cabinet at theMeeting to be held eer-W-edaftesday next,June 22nd, 1953-*.   ^e^/  *)&amp;eJ:t(4) To take note that the Secretary ofState for India would communicate with the Leader of the labour opposition in the House of Commons,with a view to the proposed Debatetaking place on some date in theweek after next..f inementTerroristPrisoners.convicted terrorist prisoners, senteneed to long terms

HE IRISHRSS STATE,.(PrevicmsReference:Cabinet32 (32)Conclusion4).  ^3o      In connection with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin5 the Cabinet had before them a Noteby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(Paper CeP. 206 (32)) on the visit to London on the10th June, 1932 of a Delegation from the Irish FreeState headed by Mr. E. de Valera and Mr, S. T. 0&apos;Kelly,the President and Vice-President of the ExecutiveCounciloThe Cabinet were reminded that when starting onhis return journey to Dublin, Mr0 de Valera had intimated (i) that it was improbable that a delegation from the Irish Free State would attend the OttawaConference9 (ii) that..he was agreeable to the House ofCommons being informed that he proposed to send afurther communication to the Government of the UnitedKingdom after consultation with his colleagues, and(iii) that in the course of discussion he had rejected the idea of arbitration on the question of the land annuities.,After a brief discussion the Cabinet agreed -(i) to take note of the account contained in paper C0Po 206 (32) of the visit to london on the 10th June of the President and Vice-President of the Executive Council of theIrish Free state(ii) that the consent of&quot;Mr. de Valera should beobtained in advance, to the disclosure inthe Irish Debate in the House of Commons onFriday, June 17th, 1932, of what had passed between the Irish and United kingdom ministers at the recent discussions in dublin and London respectively.,
4.     The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum(Paper CP.  196(32)) by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies covering an advance copy of LordMoyne&apos;s Report on Financial Questions in Kenya.This Report is to be published on June 24th.    TheMemorandum stated that the main recommendations ofthe Report, namely:- that the native contributionto revenue cannot reasonably be increased at thepresent time; that 50 per cent, of native direct taxation should be paid into a Native BettermentFund; and that the Budget must be balanced by non-native direct taxation,  i.e.  income tax, will all be highly contentious.The Secretary of State did not feel justified intaking a decision on the Report until he had receivedthe Governor&apos;s comments.    If the Governor agreed thatthe facts as found are substantially correct and thatthe conclusions founded on those facts are sound, he(the Secretary of State)  thought that Government wouldhave, to give the Governor full support in carrying outthe necessary reforms; but he was under no illusionsas to the unfavourable reception which the Report will receive from settlers in Kenya.The Cabinet agreed -(i)    That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised to givethe Governor full support in carryingout the necessary reforms, on hearingthat the Governor agreed that the fact as found in the Report are substantiallycorrect, and that the conclusionsfounded on those facts are sound;(ii)    to request the Secretary of State to convey to Lord Moyne the thanks of theCabinet ,for the exhaustive and carefulmanner in which he had carried out theenquiry.

The Memorandumcorrected the figures in CP. 187(32)  shewing thedecline in tne trade of certain foreign countries, andafter doubting whether there had been a decline in thevolume of retail sales in February-April last,expressed the view that,  so far as the unemployment figures go,  they do not indicate any substantial decreasein employment in the retail distributive trade ascompared with the corresponding months of&quot;last year.The Cabinet were informed that the exports of coalin May shewed a reduction on the figures for April,   andthat the position as regards future coal exports toItaly was causing some anxiety.
8,     With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin,  the Cabinet had before them aMemorandum (Paper CP. 186(32)) by the Minister OfLabour on the subject of the administration of transitional payments.After reminding the Cabinet that there was no power to surcharge an Authority which continuouslydisobeys the law, and that supersession constitutes the only protection for the Exchequer in the case ofa recalcitrant Authority,  the Memorandum set out thefacts in regard to the County Borough of Rotherham.In this case, in spite of numerous warnings,  thePublic Assistance Authority had continued to giveindefensible determinations.    Prom the outset, thework had been badly done; examples were given shewingthat Rotherham allowed the full scale of payment toalmost everyone,  thus making the needs testpractically inoperative, and  the view was expressed that the area was shewing the worst administration in the country.    Rotherham might be regarded as a test case, and in fairness to other and more loyalAuthorities, and as a protection to the Treasury,the Minister stated that he must use hie powersand appoint a person or persons to administer the transitional payments scheme in the area of theCounty Borough.The Cabinet concurred with the Minister of labour in the action which he proposed to take in theRotherham County Borough case.

APPENDIX I...TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner of Iraq, to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies.IMMEDIATE,No.203.        13th June.My telegram No.200 I interviewed about 30 AssyrianOfficers at the Residency this morning.     Among them were several who in addition to being officers are heads of tribes.I urged them to reflect before it was too late and to withdraw their manifesto which was a blot on their record of loyalservice.      If they accepted my advice I undertook that nofurther reduction in the Levies would be made for six months and that during this period I should continue to discuss in baghdad and London whole problem of their future.      They appearedoutwardly to have made up their minds to stand by their manifestobut at my suggestion they agreed to withhold (? decision) until their representatives had discussed matter(s) with Mar Shimunand at meeting at Amadia 15th June.      My intention is now tosend up Captain Holt with Pilot Officer to Mar Shimun renewingoffer made to officers to overlook insubordinate manifesto ifit is withdrawn and if pledges are given for future loyalty and asking for final reply by 16th June.If their last word is that they stand by manifesto thereis no alternative but to adopt plan for holding levies underrestraint which I have outlined in my previous telegram.(Sgd, )Humphrys.
