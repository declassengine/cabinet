Harriot at anearly date.   M, Harriot ha,d shown, greatgood will and had. expressed willingness to come to London, but it was thoughtthat the Prime Ministerhim in Paris on his way toC ons e quently arran gementsmade for the Prime Minister,by the Secretary of Statepreferableshould seeLaus anne.were beingaccompaniedfor Foreign Affairs, to proceed to paris on Saturday, June 11th, and to spend the greater part of Sunday in conversations with M.

This Treaty, it was thought, would be signed, but notratified, before the LatasanneConference terminated.That a communication on the abovesubject to Mr Stimson should be delayed/,until after M. HerriotVsattitude on the subject had been ascertained.That the question of the effect ofthe above policy, if carried,out,on our war debt to America wouldhave to be the subject of a freshdecision before December 15, whenthe next instalment is due.That the United Kingdom delegation should have a free-hand to handle the situation vis-a-vis the UnitedStates of America according to thecircumstances, subject, of course,to reference to the Cabinet in theevent of any important new decisionbeing required.
IpE LAUSANNE[ofJPERENOE.-Jroposedfarliamentarylebate on,F-R.2. &apos; The Chancellor of the Exchequer reportedthat at the meeting on the previous  day, already referred to,  it had been arranged that he was to speak for the Government in the Debate on the lausanne Conference which the Opposition had askedfor next week, and which was to take place on Monday,June 13th.The disci^ssion at the Cabinet revealed a strongview that a Debate at this moment would be inoppor-tune, could do no possible good, and was liable notonly to place the United Kingdom Delegation at the lausanne Conference in an embarrassing situationbut possibly even to endanger the success of theConference,The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should explain the situation to the leader of the Opposition and ask him if he would be willingto postpone the Debate until after the Lausanne conference had begun.The Prime Minister said that ifhe was unable to persuade the leader of the Opposition he would report to the Cabinet the same afternoon.
&apos;FRANCE. 3, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairseclaration of       drew attention to a telegram from the Britisholicy .Ambassador in Paris reporting the more importantpassages in M. Herriofs Declaration of Policy,and to a telegram he had just received from theBritish Ambassador intimating that M. Herriot would welcome some words of approval of his statement.The Prime Minister felt that it would be premature to send such a message before there hadbeen time to study the text of the statement, whichhad only just been received.
PB IRISH 4.   A Note by the Secretary of State forgBF STATE.Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of State for[previous War (C ,P .-198 (32))  on their visit to Dublin on reference:Cabinet 30 June 6-8, was circulated at the outset of the(32), Con-elusion 6.) Meeting. -RR- The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that       de Valera would be in London onFriday morning, and a meeting had been arranged for 11-30 a.m.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the following Ministers should negotiate with Mr de Valera:-The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,&apos; The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for War.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, owingto Parliamentary duties, was unable ;tobe present at 11.30 a.m., but indicated that if financial questions requiringhis presence were raised he might beable to attend for a time in the afternoon:(b) That the Meeting should take place inthe Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street,on Friday, June 10th, at 11-30 a.m.
IrADE WITH 5. The Cabinet had before them the Third ReportInssiA. ,of the Cabinet Committee on Trade with Russia (CP.-169kssian&apos;0paganda. (52)), the recommendations of which are summarised in the last paragraph as follows:- previous reference: (l) The Temporary Commercial Agreement ofCabinet 30 16th April, 1930, should be denouncedjf(S2)    Con- forthwith by means of a notice to bellusion 5.) given under Article 7 to terminate that o Agreement on the expiration of sixk months from the date of the notice.33(5-2-;(2) The notice should be one to terminate the Agreement at the end of six months,without any addition or- qualification.The representatives of His Majesty7sGovernment concerned with any negotia-tions for a fresh Agreement shouldhave discretion to concede a temporaryextension of the Agreement if this isin our interests.    The fact that thisdiscretion has been given should,however, be kept secret.(3) The negotiation of a fresh Anglo-russian trade Agreement is in the best interestsof the country, and the undertaking of negotiations &apos;should be authorised if andwhen . opportunity: offers .(4) If the Cabinet accept our recommendationregarding the denunciation of the Agree-ment, it will then be open to the Cabinetto determine their policy in regard tothe prohibition or restriction of theimport of Rvissian wheat into the UnitedKingdom.   We note that if the cabinet decide in favour of a,.policy of prohibi-tion or restriction, the Ottawa committee recommend that no announcement of that policy should be made prior to the ottawa conference, and we concur in this recom-mendation.(5)  It is  doubtful whether denunciation ofthe Commercial Agreement will have anysubstantial effect as regards such aspectsof Anglo-Soviet relations as propaganda,though with a free hand In trade matterswe might be able,by threats of economic pressure, to induce the Soviet Governmentto exercise more effective control overorganisations such as the Third Inter-national.    In any case we are agreed thatdenunciation of the Agreement cannot worsenthe position as -regards the propagandaissue.In addition&apos; to the above Report, which had been -before them at the previous Meeting, the Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP.-190 (32)), prepared at
their request, containingfigures as to Trade with Russia.    In this memorandum it was pointed out that in April, for the first time,exports to Russia were greater than imports;    thatduring the first four months of last year importsexceeded exports by  5,017,000, and that this excesswas reduced to  517,000 for the first four monthsof this year.    The reduction in the visible adverse balance was due both to a diminution in the value ofimports and to an increase in the value of domesticexports.Considerable discussion took&quot;place on the abovedocuments.    The issue was narrowed down to thequestion as to whether the present moment wasopportune for carrying out the Committee&apos;s recommend-ations .    This turned, to a considerable extent on thequestion of whether notice to terminate the agreement at the end of six months would exercise an adverse effect on our exports to Russia or not.    If theresults were adverse, the effect on unemployment would be serious, as illustrated by estimates givento the Cabinet by the Minister of Labour (Appendix).more particularly at the present time when unemploy-ment was Increasing.   Particulars were given ofimportant contracts (e,g., for machine tools,  ironand steel plates, and herrings) which are at presentthe subject of negotiation with the Russian SovietGovernment.   The Committee were understood to hold the view that the effect on trade would not be detrimental.    A suggestion was made that instead ofgiving notice to terminate the Trade agreement it would be better, in the circumstances, to approach the Russian Government, through their Ambassador,explain our difficulties and endeavour to negotiate
an Agreement by consent.    It was reported, however,that the Committee had considered this proposal andhad come to the conclusion, in view of previous experience in negotiations with the Soviet Govern-ment, that we should be much more likely to reach a satisfactory new arrangement if notice were givento terminate the present Trade Agreement.The Secretary of State for War was opposed toall Trade Agreements with Soviet Russia.The Prime;Minister suggested that the report should be referred back to the Committee to reconsiderits recommendations in the light of.the cabinet discussion.-The question was then raised as to whether therecommendations of the Committee on matters otherthan the Trade Agreement would also be referred back.As time did not permit the completion of thediscussion,  it was adjourned;    but at the conclusionof the Meeting the Prime Minister warned hiscolleagues of a serious leakage which had occurredimmediately after a previous Cabinet decisionaffecting Russia, and asked that every possibleprecaution should be taken within Departments toprevent a repetition of this,
-CIVIL SERVICEREMUNERATION.(previous reference reference e:Cabinet 28(38), Con-clusion 15.)6.     At the outset of the above Meeting a most secret Memorandum on Civil Service Remuneration(CP.-197 (52)) was handed round.    Its discussion was reserved until the Meeting in the afternoon.33(32)2.2, Whiteha 11 Gardens, S ,w. 1 9June 8,  1932.
APPENDIX.Read to the Cabinet by the Minister of Labour.&quot; Looked at from another aspect the total exports toRussia during the first four months of this year werevalued at  5,700.000 of which just over  5,000 9000 representedmachinery of one kind or another.      If it is assumed that each 1,000?000 represents the employment directly and indirectlyof^5.000 workpeople for a year (and this is probably a conservative estimate for this class of work) the  3,000,000of machinery may be taken as equivalent to the employmentQf&apos; I59000 workpeople for a year:    while if it is furtherassumed that exports of machinery remain on the average,at the same level throughout the year, the year&apos;s exportsof machinery ( 9,000,000 ) would represent the employmentdirectly and indirectly of about 45,000 persons for a year.To this figure must be added the employment represented byexports other than machinery.&quot;X(NOTE;    This figure is derived from material in the Ministry&apos;s possession.      a figure obtained independently from the statistical department of the Employers&apos;Organisation is slightly higher.)
