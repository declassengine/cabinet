Mr Neville Chamberlain(previous reference:      said that, after consultation with the Service Depart-Cabinet 21(25), Con-     rnents, he proposed to make some rnodif ica.tion in thiselusion 1. )respect.    His proposal was that in the case of widows&apos;and orphans&apos; pensions&apos; the Bill should be drawn up onthe basis that in cases where the Service pension andallowance is less than the provision made under the Bill,it- should be made up to that provision by a payment fromthe Pensions Fund &quot;00 the Service Departments.    But in. - the case of Old Age Pensions he proposed that asdisability pensions would be awarded by the service departments to men at very varied ages, and as such menon return to civil life would be in insurable employment and would make in that capacity the contributions provid-ed for under the Bill, they should be entitled,on attain-ing the appropriate age, to receive the Old Age Pensionprovided under the Bill in addition to their DisabilityPension.The Cabinet approved the above proposal of the Minister of Health.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,April 27, 1925.
