m COALllSPOTE.(Previous .Reference:Cabinet 27(25) i Con-bluslon 9.)1. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinetthat up to. the previous night it had appearedprobable that representatives of the ooalownersarid miners would meet at an early date for thefurther disousslon of their dispute.   the secretaries of the Mining Association and theMiners Federation had met, and a meeting had beenarranged on the basis of a formula by which thecoal owners undertook not to press their wagesproposals, although they would not be asked towithdraw them.   Last night, however * the SouthWales Coalowners had posted notices of terminationof the present Agreement, offering re-engagement .on terms identical with those which the coal owners had just undertaken not to press for the moment.It remained to be seen whether this action had beentaken deliberately or by Inadvertence * but in the meanwhile the aotion of the South Wales Coalownersput the meeting of the coalowners&apos; and miners1representatives in jeopardy.
2. The Minister of Labour info mad his colleagues that the question of a strike In the wollen indusrty was in the balance.   100*000 workers were involvedin the dispute, which related to a question of 5$in wa^s.
kt 4.3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on thequestion of the Programme of Naval Constructions andin addition to the Report of the Cabinet Committee(Paper CP.-342 (25)) which had been before them onthe last occasion when the question was discussed,they had before them a Memorandum by the Chanoellorof the Exchequer (Paper CP.-360 (25)).The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that,as arranged at the previous Meeting, he had heldconversations with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the B1irst Lord of the Admiralty, but unfortunatelywithout reaching agreement.    In the circumstances,after careful consideration of the present controversy in all Its aspects, and in the.light of the present political situation, he had decided to make areoommendation to the Cabinet.   In view of the needfor an early settlement of this question, and moreparticularly in view of the threatened industrialcrisis, he appealed to his oolleagues to accept these proposals.   The Prime Minister&apos;s recommenda-tion was unanimously accepted, subject to the FirstLord of the Admiralty reserving his position until hehad had an opportunity of examining the proposals indetail with his technical advisers.On the recommendation of the Prime minister the Cabinet agreed *-(a) That the Admiralty programme of cruisers as set out in the committee report (CP.-342 (25)) on   page should be accepted in principle, subjectto discussion between the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the First Lordas to the actual dates of laying down the seven cruisers of the first twoyears, in accordance with the various alternatives proposed by the PrimeMinister to minimise the expense asfollows:-
1936-6 1086*7- 1937-82 plus 1 &apos; - 2 plus 22 Plus 2        1 plus 2 or 2 plus I3 &apos; 4and re-open discussion in 1926*(NOTEi The figures &quot;2 plus Is for theyear 1925-6 signify 2 cruisersto he hi id down during 1925and 1 during;- the first quarterof 1928.    Similarly *S plus B8for the year 1926-7 sigaitise.2 cruisers laid a cmx during1926 and 2 during the first quarter- of 1987/aid so forth).lb) Thats with the exception of the 4 ChtmGunboats and the 3 book Sections * therest of the Admiralty programme shallbegin next year and not this year* andShall thereafter be in accordance withthe recommendations of the committee report (cp -342 (25)) an page S.(e) fhai the Admiralty should asset theincreased charge in 1925-6 by savings-on other heads&quot;and by further ander^spending (other than that allowed forin the  2,000.000 *shades * cut) and thatno new money shall he asked for unlessst the end of the fimnsial yesi? theCabinet is satisfied that thsre is nootha r alternative *(d) Tnat the isaintenansse asd - other Votes ofthe i%vy (other than new construotion)shall bo the suh^eot of m specialinquiry (which will also extend to other service Departments) with the object of presenting to the Cabinet proposals for reduction of expenditure to equalisefrom Admiralty votes the increased cost involved in the earlier beginning ofthe cruiser progrsesme that was proposed.1b the /Committee Report (CP. *34S 125/page 5):   this Inquiry in no way tosupersede the ordinary functions ofthe Treasury in regard to Department&amp;1expenditure^
4. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn, as amatter of urgency, to a Question to be asked thePrime Minister in Parliament the same afternoon asto whether the Tariff Advisory Board appointed atthe end of 1923 had made a Report, whether that report was unanimous, and whether there was any objection to its publication.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefact that.in January, 1924, In different circumstance-stances from the present, the Cabinet had decidedthat the Report should not be published ispontaneously;that if there was a demand in Parliament the Governmentshould at once assent to its publication;   that inthis event the interim and preliminary nature of theReport should be explained, and it should be made clear that it had not received the approval of theGovernment.The Cabinet agreed --That no useful object would.be served in raising an old controversy in circumstances which had completelychanged, and that the Prime minister should reply to Colonel Gretton&apos;.question to the effect that no useful purpose would be served by publishing the Report of the Tariff advisory commission.
5. The Cabinet had before them, as a matter of.urgencyj telegram No.534 from the Governor of Hong-Kongto the Secretary of State fox,further large quantities of Russian arms are beingimported at Canton;   that numbers of Hong-Kong strikersare being aimed arid drilled by the Russians;   that thepossibility could not be ignored of Hong-Kong being attacked;   that the Governor was unable to regardwithout disquietude the depletion of the garrison of hong-Kong as the result of sending troops/bo Shameen;and urging that the needs of Shameen should be providedfor in some other way as soon as possible.In connection with this telegram the attentionof the Cabinet was drawn to a Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee on the Situation in China (paper c.P.-527 (25)), containing recommendations, inter alia,for increases in the naval forces on the China station and in the garrison of Hong-Kong.The Cabinet were informed that the question ofincreasing the garrison of Hong-Kong at the presenttime required careful consideration in its internationalaspects.The Cabinet agreed  &quot;the Colonies, pointing out thatThat the question should be considered at an early date by the Committee ofImperial Defence.
