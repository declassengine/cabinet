The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that theoontinuous conversations he had been carrying on forthe previous 48 hours, in concert with the Pirst Lordof the -Admiralty and the Minister of Labour, with thevarious parties concerned in the coal-mining disputehad not resulted in a settlement.    The mine owners had made some slight concessions;   the miners none at all.A wide gap separated the two.The Cabinet surveyed the situation as a whole.Unless some action-could be taken to avert it, a miners&apos;strike would begin at midnight on the following day.All Trades Unions had decided to give the miners financial support.    The railwayman had decided to handle no coal,not even for their own engines.    The railway managerswould feel bound to dismiss those refusing to handlecoal, both on grounds of discipline and because theywould by their action be prevented from fulfilling their functions as common carriers.    A strike on the railwaysanwas therefore/inevitable concomitant to&apos; a coal strike.The transport workers would probably strike in sympathy.The attitude of the seamen&apos;s union was uncertain.   On a review of the financial effects of previous coal strikesit was shown that the cost and the loss of revenue would amount to a huge sum.    The effect on the. trade andindustry of the country was shown to be of the gravestcharacter.The arrangements for securing the continuance ofthe public services during a strike of this characterwere examined and found to be ready and complete so faras circumstances permitted. While the organisation was complete, it was only a skeleton,and could not be put jin operation until volunteers had come forward. Volun-teers, however, could not be called for until an emergency(was proclaimed.    The arrangements for proclaiming an
emergency were reported to be in readiness.   Untilvolunteers bad been enrolled and sorted out, theorganisation could not function, and this would require a few days.   As compared with 1921, when lorries hadbeen available, a good deal of improvisation would berequired;   but this had been prepared for.    The most difficult task was the organisation of supplies of milk and yeast.   The army was complete as regards numbersuntil the autumn trooping season began, and well placedas compared with 1921, when two Divisions had beenstationed in Ireland.    For some time, at any rate%- itwould be unnecessary to call up reservists, much less to enrol   a Defence Force for support of the civil power in an emergency.    All the public services, andmost of the railways, had comparatively large suppliesof coal, and there was an unprecedentedly large amountof oil fuel available, though its distribution presenteddifficulties in the event of a railway strike.There was general agreement that in the eventof a strike on the scalo now threatened, the maintenanceof the essential public services could be effected, butonly by a great and costly effort, and that the effecton the financial position of the country and on thetrade and industry of the country must be very serious.During the meeting of the Cabinet a letter wasreoeived from the Miners1 Federation giving their replyto a suggestion that had been made in the course of therecent conversations that there should be an authori-tative inquiry to try and get to the bottom of theeconomic difficulties of the. coalmining industry.The reply was to the effect that the miners would not oppose the inquiry, provided that the terms of reference were satisfactory and that in the meantime the mine
workers were not asked to submit- either to a reductionof wages or an extension of the hours of labour.The Cabinet were informed that in the present state of the coal trade the mineowners as a wholecould not oontinue the existing rates of wages on thepresent hours of labour without losses which theycould not meet.    To enable the inquiry to take place it would be necessary to make some provision wherebyeither the State would pay the difference between thepresent wages and those which the industry could afford,or, as a possible alternative, to continue the presentwages in those pits which could be worked without loss and to allow those pits which were less favourablysituated to fall out of use.    The cost to the State ofthe former plan was estimated very approximately at 10,000,000 for an inquiry extending over nine months.On a review of the situation as a whole, theCabinet agreed  (a) (Byia majority) That, as between a national strike&apos; and the&quot; payment of assistance tothe mining industry, the latter course was the less disadvantageous. That thePrime Minister and some of his colleagues should endeavour to effect a settlement on the basis of a comprehensive inquiry into the position of the mining industry,and should have authority to agree, ifnecessary, to some temporary State assist-ance, as proposed above, during the inquiry:(b) That the Prime Minister should inform theHouse of Commons that negotiations are stillin progress:(c) That, pending the result of these negotia-tions, preliminary and unostentatiouspreparations should.continue fOr maintaining the public services in the event of a strike.-2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,July 30, 1925.
