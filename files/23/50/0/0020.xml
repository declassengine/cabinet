(d) That, to meet the contingency of a breakdown in negotiations and astrike on Friday next, all arrange -ments should be made for the issueof an Emergency Proclamation under1the Emergency Powers Act, givingpower to take control of coal at the docks.The Home Secretary undertook tocoiiiicainicate with the King on thissubject, in order that His Majestymight be apprised of the reasonsfor which it would be necessary tohold a Council,.and the Lord Presi-dent of the Council under tools tomake all.the necessary arrangements:(e) That if the Railway Managers should ask for official guidance as totheir action in the event of the refusal by the railwaymen on asmall scale to handle coal for thebunkering of engines, and so forth,they should be advised that so lonras the action was on a small scaleit would be wise to overlook itrather than to create a conflagrationby disciplinary action.2, Whitehall Gardens, s.vV. 1,July 28, 198 5.
