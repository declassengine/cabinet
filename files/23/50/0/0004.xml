Con- Meeting on March 18, 1925 (Cabinet 16 (25), Conclusion 2.)lasicn 1.)The Conclusions of the Committee ofImperial Defence on April 2,. 1925:The questions referred to the Committeeof Imperial Defence by the Cabinet:A Memorandum by the Secretary of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, on theDevelopment of Imperial Defence Policyin the Par East:War and Financial Power: Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer, covering a Memorandum by the Treasury:(All the above are attached topapTr-cn^^rgB^rmTn---Mr Austen chamberlain s and Lord CurzonlsStatements on pages 2 and 3 of theMinutes.of the 193rd Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defenoe (Paper. CP. -120  (25)):Note by the Chancellor of the exchequer on The Economic Power of Japan (CI.D.Paper 553-B):A Memorandum by the Pirst Lord of theAdmiralty, on The Political Outlook inthe Par East. (Paper CP. -139 (25)).The Cabinet agreed -/(a) On the understanding that the presentdecision did not in&quot;any way reverse thegeneral policy of the Government toprovide a base at Singapore to accommo-date the main fleet (the programme for which is under consideration by aspecial Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence), and that thedecision of the Cabinet on March 2,.1925, in regard, to the programme forthe next few years was also unaffected,- to approve the following recommendationsof the Coniiittee of Imperial Defence:-
(i) The Ooii&amp;committee of Imperial Defence reoommendthat the policy of leaving to the Admiralty,subject to the paramount authority of theCabinet, the responsibility for the naval defence of the Empire on. the basis of theone-Power standard, should not be reversedor modified.    Even before the War it was recognised that the two-Power standard.didnot necessarily imply that our fleets were able simultaneously to deal with the con-centrated fleets of two first-class I%valPowers in different quarters of the globeas well as to provide for all other navalrequirements.    This is equally true of theone-Power standard today. The requirementsof a one-Pa/er stardard are satisfied if our fleet, wherever situated, is equal tothe fleet of any other nationj whereversituated, provided that arrangements aremade from time to time in different partsof the world? according as the international situation requires , to&quot;&apos;enable the local forces to maintain the situation againstvital and irreparable damage pending the arrival of the main fleet, and to give themain fleet on arrival sufficient mobility.(ii) The Committee accept the view of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs that in existingcircumstances aggressive action against theBritish Empire on the part of Japan withinthe next ten years is not a contingencyseriously to be apprehended.The Foreign Office should be responsible forwarning the Cabinet and the Committee ofImperial Defence of any change in the inter-national situation in the Far East whichwould necessitate a fresh review of thequestion.(iii) Although, in accordance with recent decisions,preliminary &quot;arrangements to establish docking:facilities for our largest ships at singapore and to develop gradually the necessary oil fuelinstallations on our Eastern routes should proceed, there is no necessity, in view of conclusion (ii), to make preparations involvingadditional expenditure for placing at Singapore,for a decisive battle In the Pacific, a Britishbattle fleet with cruisers, flotillas and allancillary vessels superior in strength, or at least ec-ual, to the sea-going Navy of Japan.This decision should be reviewed automaticallyby the Committee of Imperial&apos;Defence every year,in the light of the Inte:- national situation.Further, in order that all the data requiredfor a decision may be readily available inthe event of a change in the situation in the&apos;Far East, the Committee of imperial defence and the Singapore Sub-Committee should inquireand report as&apos; to the preparations which would!have to be made if it became necessary to reverse the above decision.
To meet the unlikely contingency ofwar occurring &quot;before the base at singapore is&apos;capable of sustaining aBritish fleet superior to the JapaneseNavy, the Admiralty should consider in advance what facilities can be madeavailable from Great Britain or else-where to supplement the facilities which already exist in the Par East.(b) That, in connection with the second Con-clusion of the Committee of Imperial Defence,the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should be asked to instruct his Office tobear in mind that any warning of a changein the international situation in the far east would not be of much value for thepurposes of expediting our defensive pre-reparations in that region unless issuedsome-years in advance of a situation ofactual danger:(c) That the Secretar;/ should be instructed to revise the Minutes of the Committee ofImperial Defence dealing: with this question,with a view to the elimination of the record of any remarks which might be interpretedto imply an intention on the part of theBritish Government not to provide ade-adequately for the protection of Britishinterests in the Southern Pacific.    unless this were dons , a misleading impressionmight be derived from remarks made spon-taneously in the course of a very free dis-cussion.
4. The Cabinet had before them an Interim Reportof a Cabinet Committee appointed to consider the ques-tion of Marriage Allowances in the Navy (Paper CP. -199 (2,5)).The Committee reported that, owing to thelimitation in their Terms of Reference, which restrictedthem from making proposals liable to result in claims from the other Service Departments in regard toMarriage Allowances s they were unable to make any recommendation on the subject of Marriage allowances in the ravy, and that they had not enquired into the merits of corresponding claims put forward by the WarOffice and Air Ministry.    The Financial Secretary tothe Admiralty had recorded his dissent from the Report.The Cabinet agreed --(&amp;) That the whole of the questions underconsideration by Sir John G-gilmour&apos;sCommittee should be referred to afresh Cabinet Committee composed ofthe following Ministers, who had no connection with the Service Departments:-The Secretary for Scotland (in the Chair),The Minister of Labour,The First Commissioner of Works,The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,,The Committee should be authorised totake any expert evidence they requiredto supplement the information already at the disposal of Sir John Gilrnour&apos;sCommittee:(b) Thatin answer to a Question by SirBertram Falle, asking if His majesty&apos;s government contemplate a reduction of pay in His Majesty1s Navy, the FirstLord of the Admiralty should beauthorised to reply to the effect thatthere is&apos; no Intention to interfere withany existing contracts , and that jif a supplementary Question was asked, heshould state that the whole subject was under consideration.
