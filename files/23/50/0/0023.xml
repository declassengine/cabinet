signrmr,x \JdJ,sia.viouserence:inet 41), Con-sion 3, )ICY.        1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinet that, as the result of ameeting of the Committee appointed at the meeting referred to in the margin, conclusions had beenreached which might be summed up as follows(a) That there was no occasion at thepresent moment for the Governmentto change its policy towards Russia:(b) That the Committee should be. convenedagain to review the situation in theevent of any fresh development, andin any event that it should meetafter the Recess.There was general agreement that the activitiesof Communist agents in this country should be carefully watched in the present industrial situation.
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that M. Briand, the French Minister ofForeign Affairs, intended to visit London shortly,probably next week, in order to discuss a draft reply to the German Note on the subjeot of the.Pact,and generally with a view to reaching agreement withthe British Government on this question.    The princi-pal difficulties .    . requiringadjustment were as follows:-First, that the French desired to bring thePaot       &apos;. into operation if Germany should eomndt a&quot;hostile act&quot; as defined by Article 44 of the Treatyof Versailles, that is to say, if she violated in anymanner Articles 42 and 43 of the same Treaty:   a&quot;hostile act&quot; as so defined might include some minor and technical breach of the Treaty of Versailles,and the British Government considered that the Pactshould come into operation only in theevent of some serious threat of an aggressivecharacter which would confer some distinct advantageon the aggressor.Second, the apprehensions of the French lestone Power on the Council might obstruct a decision.Mr Chamberlain recognised that the representative onthe Council of some minor Power, whose territories were adjacent to those of an aggressor, might fearto give an opinion hostile to the aggressor State.This might perhaps be provided against by arrangingthat if the guarantor State was satisfied that an aggression had taken plaoe, it should not be boundto await a decision of the Council before taking action to give effect to the guarantee.
Third, difficulties as to the Eastern boundaries of Germany.The Cabinet agreed  *-(a) That in his negotiations with the PrenohForeign Minister, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should have theassistance of such members of the cabinet as might be within reach of London duringthe early part of the Recess:-(b) That the Secretary of the Cabinet should ascertain the movements of minister during the Recess, and should informthe Prime Minister before the next meeting as to what Ministers would be within&quot;reach of London during thefollowing week.

After a discussion on the various questions arising out of the provisional settlement of therecent coal dispute^ the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, with a view to a discussion attheir next Meeting on Friday, August7th, and with the object, if possible,of enabling a        more effectivs schemeto be drawn up than at present exists for maintaining vital national servioesin the event of a strike, the HomeSecretary should oiroulate a Memorandumelaborating proposals which he had made at the&apos; Meeting for inviting thegeneral public to volunteer for themaintenance of essential nationalservioes, without waiting for anemergency to arise, and for suchpublicity of the Supply and transport arrangements as might be necessaryfor this purpose:(b\That, in considering the position ofthe Supply and Transport Organisationafter the Recess, the Cabinet shouldmake inquiry into the legal position of Trades Unions which might subject! the whole oommunity to suffering andI loss in connection with disputes withWhich they were not themselves directly^involved:(c) That at their next Meeting the Ministerof Labour, in communication with theSecretary for Mines, should make suggestions to the Cabinet as to the composition and Terms of Reference ofthe Coal Inquiry.The general view of the Cabinet wasthat &quot;the scope of the Inquiry shouldbe sufficiently wide not only to providefor an investigation of the pointsproposed by the miners, which areappended to the Report of the McMillanCommittee, but also to enable thepublic to derive from the Reportfull information as to the position ofthe coal industry in all its aspects:(d) That the Prime Minister should have discretion to give a hint or otherwise,according as he might think fit, asto the intention of the Government tomake more elaborate arrangements thanat present exist for maintainingessential national services during astrike.
