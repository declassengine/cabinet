1. The Cabinet had been summoned at the requestof the Secretary of State, for Foreign Affairs toconsider, as a natter of urgency, certain questionsof Foreign Affairs,, the first of which related to thesituation in China.The Cabinet had before them, for information,a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D.Paper No.61.7-B) , containing recommendations both asregards measures for dealing with an emergency and infavour of a permanent reinforcement of the naval and.military forces in the Far East.    No decision was asked for at this meeting in regard to this Report,but the general view of the Cabinet was that the time was. approaching when the Governments, principally con-cerned should be consulted as to the measures to betaken for the protection of foreigners in the event ofa serious outbreak in China.The immediate, question before the Cabinet aroseout of the following circumstances:-After the recent disturbances at Shanghai, the diplomatic Corps of the Powers concerned at Pekin had sent delegates to Shanghai, Including a representative-of the British Legation., to ascertain the facts.    Onthe basis of their delegates1 report, the diplomatic,body had drawn up a statement of conclusions which included, inter alia,.a censure on the Chairman of the municipal Council, who was of American nationality,and the replacement of the Commissioner ofPolice,who was of British, nationality, on the. ground that hehad been, absent from his post during an. hour and a quarter of the critical period of the disturbances,that he. had not made proper arrangements to disperse
the demonstrators and obtain control of the situation,that he had shown negligence, lack of judgment and lack of professional ability, and that his was theresponsibility primarily involved; that the Policeregulations were defective, and that the ChineseGovernment must take energetic measures to fix theresponsibility for a demonstration that had been organised on Chinese territory.    These conclusionshad been communicated to the Consuls at Shanghai, with instructions to communicate them to the Municipal Council,and if the latter refused to carry them out,the Consulswere instructed in the last resort to dissolve theCouncil and to replace it by a Consular AdministrativeCommission.    It had been   Intended to publish thestatement on Friday, July 3rd, and to communicate iton the same date to the Chinese Government.    TheBritish, American and Japanese Consuls-General at shangai, however, representing 90 per cent,  of foreign,interests, had entered a strong protest against thedecision of the diplomatic body, more particularly onthe ground that the inquiry on which it was based wasnot a public one and that it would have a most serious effect in Shanghai.    The Consular body had asked for a postponement of publication, in order that they mightstudy the practical and legal difficulties with whichthey -might be faced, and make preparations.    Publica-tion had then been postponed from July 3rd. to July 6th.A further postponement had taken place at the requestof the British Government, but the foreign diplomatic representatives had expressed &apos;surprise and resentmentat this action.The question before the Cabinet, therefore,was as to whether they should support the diplomaticbody at Pekin,. who naturally approached the question
from the point of view of China as a whole, or theConsuls-General at Shanghai, who viewed it from the standpoint of the effect in Shanghai.    The cabinet were informed that the British Minister and other experts recently home on leave from Pekin favoured the action proposed by the diplomatic body as a first step necessary for the recovery of the situation InChina.While there was general agreement that the diplomatic Corps must be supported, it was felt thatthere was force in the objection of the Consuls-general that the inquiry on which the conclusions of the diplomatic body had been based had not been a publicone.    Concern was expressed also lest the dismissal ofthe Commissioner of Police at Shanghai should resultin weakening the nerve of persons all over China whoare liable to be called on at any moment to takedifficult decisions to meet emergencies.    A suggestion was made that it would be preferable to suspend the officials concerned at Shanghai pending; some form of judicial inquiry, rather than to insist on theirdismissal without a public inquiry;   but objections were urged aealns-;t this course.    It was felt that- itwas desirable, before taking action, to be sure thatthe American and Japanese Governments supported theirdiplomatic representatives at Pekin and not theirConsuls-General at Shanghai, who had associated them-selves in the British Consul-General&apos;s protest.The. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the Cabinet a draft telegram to the British Charge&apos;d&apos;Affaires at Pekin, which was approved by the cabinet with modificatiens introduced by the Secretary of state as the result of the discussion.   With a view to makingrtain that the United States and Japanese Governmentsalso supported the Diplomatic Corps rather than.the consular representatives at Shanghai, the telegram was to be repeated to Washington ana Tokio.-3-
The text of the telegram,as finally approved, is as follows;-,Your telegram, No,.208 (of July 6th, findings of diplomatic &quot;body on&apos; Shanghai inoldont).I am sorry to learn that my desire fortimo to reflect further on the proposed communi-cation of the diplomatic bodyTs findings to thepress and to the Chineso government should havearoused the resentment of your dolieagues.   Mymisgivings are concerned principally with thotwo following points:-1,    Is it certain that the particulardecisions of tho diplomatic &quot;body - e.g. the dismissal of tho police commissioner - willnot be resisted?   It would be extremelyawkward if the municipal council were torefuse to givo effect to them, quite apart.from any possible doubts whether they wouldbe legally enforceable.2.   His Majesty&apos;s Consul General1sprotest is apparently supported by theUnited States and Japanose oolleaguos.   Areyou satisfied that their governments do not support them rather than their representa-tives at Peking in this conflict of opinion?Provided that you are satisfied on theabove two points - i.e.  (1) that the decisionsof the diplomatic body will not be effectivelyresisted and (2) that your United States and japanese colleagues have the concurrence oftheir governments - you are authorised to actas yo$J propose, subject to the following.I am prepared to give you full support as regards the substance of the findings, butI suggest that for purposes of publication and of communication to the municipal counciltheir form oould and should be modified tomeet legitimate personal susceptibilities ofthe chairman and others.    Thus the announcement should begin with the substance -of the last paragraph of your telegram No.105 (of July 2nd). -I can see no reason why the fact that tho demon-stretIons were organised on Chinese territory should not be put in the forefront of tho docu-ment and in a more amplified and emphatic form,followed immediately by the statement that theChinese government must take steps to fix res-ponsibility etc.The situation having thus boon stated, theregret expressed under point 1 of your telegramwould naturally and logically follow.Second paragraph of point 1 should be omitted.    The wording of the first paragraphImplies sufficient censure.Please endeavour to secure these modifi-cations.
His Majesty&amp;s Minister concurs.In sending this message I assuire that you and your colleagues are satisfied that yourinformation is sufficient to support each find-ing. for oxample that you have ascertained that colonel McEuon had no good reason for his absence; and that you end thoy are furthersatisfied that this communication at the presentmoment will not provoke a. still more serious situation at Shanghai or elsewhere, particularly by destroying the authority of foreigners inpositions of responsibility in this crisis.Repeated to Manchester Mass Ho.151 andTokyo Wo.114.
&quot;14 Q&apos;   Lid2.    The second argent question for which theCabinet had been summoned was that of Morocco.As regards the proposed measures of naval surveil-lance in the territorial waters of Morocco and theBritish co-operation within the Tangier neutral zone,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed hiscolleagues that the Legal Adviser of the Foreign office had now reported that our rights of interference were limited to ships of those Powers which had adhered tothe Tangier Convention arid to those which had neverpossessed extra-territorial rights in Morocco.    Theydid not apply, however, to the. ships of the UnitedStates or Italy, which Powers had not adhered to theConvention.    It would be necessar:/&quot; for him to notifythis to the French and Spanish Governments.In addition, he had now received the specific proposals of the Madrid Conference, which spoke ofsurveillance within a territorial limit of six milesfrom the coast of Morocco as well as waters betweenparticular capes Involving more than six miles, and claimed the right of pursuit and search in the opensea beyond those limits.    He proposed to protest against these extensions of the international law in regard tolimits of territorial waters, and to decline to recog-nise them so far as British ships were concerned.As regards the need for an allied force toensure neutrality in the Allied zone, the Secretaryof State had received a message from M. Briand late in the evening of Saturday, July 4th, to the effectthat the zone had been violated by Moroccan tribes on june 29th.-   Since then, the British representative inTangier had confirmed the report, but that the Moorishforces had withdrawn and that the tritesmen had sentsatisfactory assurances.-6-
With reference to the desire of the Cabinet,to limit military conversations to the General staff and the Military Attaches in London of the powers concerned, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that since the last Meeting he had learned fromthe Secretary of State for War that the Chief of theImperial General Staff considered that the topographic-al and other technical information available inLondon in regard to the Tangier Zone was inadequate for such conversations and that he would propose tosend a.British Mission to Tangier to explore the wholequestion.Various suggestions were made for overcoming the difficulty presented by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, e.g., that the natter should be dis-cussed between the Consuls at Tangier with military&apos; but none of these proposals was accepted.The Cabinet agreed that the despatch of aMilitary Mission to Tangier was undesirable, and thatthe conversations should be be gun in London with such information as was available, supplemented by theinformation which could no doubt be obtained from paris and Madrid.During; the discussion the question was raisedof the strategical Importance of the neutrality ofTangier, and the Secretary was asked to see that anyReports relevant to the subject were circulated to theCabinet.tehali Gardens, S.W. 1,.July 6, 1925.
