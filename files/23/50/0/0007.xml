At the request of the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet agreed  That a Committee, composed as follows -/n The Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),The Home Secretary,The First Lord of the Admiralty,&apos;The Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries,---The Secretary for Scotland,^The First Commissioner of Works -should consider jihe question of theeffect of the Arrangements incorporated in the Finance Bill for, the increaseof death duti.es and the relief ofsuper-tax onfegricultural interests,with a view, Jif possible, to. somealleviation fo those interests, xS S C BE TEE3 BUDGETfcOR 1925-26.The Effect of increase of death Dutiesion Aerie a I-tural Inter-9StS-Previous,Reference:Cabinet 22(25) , Gon-clusion 2.)
2. The chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that he had received a communication from theIrish Free State Minister for Finance in consequenceof the arrangements contained in the Finance Billfor the re-imposition of the McKenna duty of 33^3 per cent, on motor cars.    The Irish Free State atpresent imposed a levy of 20 per cent, on the importa-tion of all motor cars, including those of GreatBritain.    The Finance Minister had suggested anarrangement under which Great Britain and the IrishFree State would admit motor cars manufactured in thetwo countries free of duty, and at the same time theIrish Free State would impose an import duty on foreignT.motor oars of 33 /3 per cent.The Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in concert with the President of theBoard of Trade, should have authorityto make a settlement with the IrishFree State on the&quot; lines proposed.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS.       3. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsWjourity. informed his oolleagues that the Cabinet Committeeon the draft reply of the French Government to the(previous reference: Gorman Note on Security had met on Tuesday, May 26th,Cabinet 26(25), Con- and had made considerable progress!   As the result of elusion 2(a).)discussion the Committee had asked him to prepare adraft for their consideration at a meeting to be held the same afternoon.    The proposals of the Committee,however, could not be ready before the dispersal ofthe Cabinet for the Whitsuntide holidays.    In themeantime the question had become one of great urgency.In this connection Mr Austen Chamberlain referred toLord D&apos;Abernon&apos;s telegram No.204, of May 26th, convey-ing a message from the German Secretary of State to theeffect that he was apprehensive of the effect on Germanopinion of the long delay in replying to the GermanMemorandum of February 9th.   Before the Cabinet re-ass enb led, Mr Chamberlain himself would have been compelled to proceed to Geneva to attend a meeting ofthe Council of the League of Nations arranged some weeks ago.   He was most reluctant not to fulfil this-engagement, more especially as M. Briand had Intimatedhis intention to attend if Mr Chamberlain did so, andthis would provide an admirable opportunity for an exchange of views between the two Foreign Ministers.Be therefore asked, whether the Cabinet would prefer tomeet again on the following morning or to delegate to the Cabinet Committee authority to approve finallyon their behalf the terms of the reply to the FrenchGovernment.The Cabinet agreed -To delegate to the Cabinet Committeefull authority on their behalf to approve the terms of the reply of theSecretary of State to the French Note.-3-
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that the proceedings of the arms Traffic Conference, now in session at Geneva,had been found continuously to raise questions of moreor less importance, upon the answers to which two orthree Departments had to be consulted and to agree.Consequently, at his request, the Prime Minister had approved the re-assembly of the Committee which hadearlier dealt with the question of Arms Traffic, with lord Cecil of Chelwood in the Chair.    Lord Cecil hadbeen given authority to approve ,all outward telegramsin regard to the Aims Traffic Convention.Two difficulties had arisen between the Britishand French delegates;    one, in regard to Abyssinia,and the other in regard to the inclusion of warshipswithin the scope of the Convention,The French had at first been inclined to supportAbyssinia in her resistance to Inclusion in the SpecialZones.    The Italian delegates, on the other hand, had supported the British view.    In conversation with theFrench Ambassador, Mr Chamberlain had represented theimportance to us of the inclusion of Abyssinia in theSpecial Zones,&quot; and had illustrated this by pointing-out how disadvantageous France would find it ifAbyssinia were situated on-the borders of Morocco.Without committing himself in anyway, he had promised to examine carefully the reasons for the exclusion of warships from the Convention.    M. Briand had then,without making any bargain, agreed to the inclusionof Abyssinia.c: In the discussion which followed, it transpired that the main reasons for the inclusion of warshipshad been, first, that warships manufactured in this
country would have been liable to examination Inforeign countries at which they might have to call onthe way to their destination;   and, second, that acertificate would have to be given before they couldleave this country, and it was assumed that this would necessitate careful examination.    These investigations.,it was thought, would deter foreign nations fromplacing orders in this country (where the examinationswould be liable to scrupulous fulfilment) to the detriment of the armament Industry, the maintenanceof which was of great importance from a naval point ofview..    The first of these objections, however, hadalready been removed by a decision of the conference that consignments of arms should not be investigatedin transit.   As regards the second, it appeared that nodetailed inspection would be required in order toobtain a license for export.The First Lord of the Admiralty, while preferringthe latest proposals of the Admiralty on the subject,agreed that,if the matter was considered important fromthe point of view of foreign policy, the Admiralty wouldconcede the inclusion of warships.Having regard to the importance attached to thematter by the Seoretary of State for Foreign Affairs,and more particularly in view of the alacrity with which France had met our wishes in regard to Abyssinia,the Cabinet agreed --That Lord Cecil should have authority 1to make the concession, if necessary,and at the point in the negotiations at which he considered it desirable.

5. The Cabinet took note of Memoranda circulatedby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs showingthe genesis of the recent Conference in London onSleeping Sickness (Papers CP.-270 (25) and CP.-271(25))..The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that- the British delegates atthe Conference had written;strongly supporting its recommendations.    The original proposals for a rovingCommission with wide powers,, costing  30,000, of whichthe British Government was to pay  27,000, had been considerably modified.    Under the present proposals the League of Nations Commission would work, at Entebbein Uganda, for a period not exceeding; one year, at theend of which it would present a Report to the Experts&apos;Committee.    The Commission would work under Dr. Duke,an official of the Uganda Administration, the recentlycompleted laboratory at Entebbe being used as a base.The Commission would consist of Dr. Duke, a Frenchdoctor, a Belgian doctor, and Dr. Kleins, a Germansavant who has had special experience in certain aspects of the problem and is an investigator .of thefirst rank.    The cost of the special Commission was estimated at approximately  10,000, the British oontribut Ion to &quot;which would not exceed  3,500.Haying regard to the reduced scope and cost ofthe proposed League of Nations Commission, the cabinet agreed  That the proposals of the League ofNations Commission should be supportedby the British Government, but thatthis should be without prejudice to alarger and more comprehensive inquiry to be conducted under tho auspices ofthe British Government.
6.    The attention of the Cabinet was drawn, as amatter of urgency, to a series of telegrams which hadbeen despatched in regard to the situation at Akaba(Nos.  1 and 2, of May 27th, to the Officer Commanding1ELM. s.  CORNFLOWER, and No. 35 to Mr Bui lard, Jeddah).The present position had arisen from the factthat ex-King Hussein, after having; been driven byIbn Saud from Mecca to Jeddah, had taken refuge atAkaba, which was claimed, by the British Government asfalling within the territory of Trans-Jordan, for whichthey are responsible under the mandate of Palestine,although the frontier has not as yet been delimited.At Akaba ex-King Hussein had indulged in acts of an un-neutral character against Ibn Saud, with the consequencethat the latter had intimated his intention to despatch a force against that town.    In these circumstances theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, at the requestof the Secretary of State for the Colonies, had sentmessages to ex-King Hussein and to Ibn Saud, with aview to securing that,if the attack took place, ex-king hussein should be removed without delay to H.M. S.CORNFLOWER, but that if the attack was postponed heshould be given three weeks in which to find anotherplace of refuge.    Both parties had been informed of theintention of the British Government to take steps toestablish the authority of the Trans-Jordan Administra-tlon in the area for which His Majesty^ s government regarded themselves as responsible to the League ofNations , which included both Maan and Akaba.    Ibn Saudhad been reminded that this town lies within a boundarywithin which he had been Informed in October last thatan unprovoked aggression on his part would be regardedas an attack upon territory for which His Majesty&apos;s
Government are responsible, and had been told that if his forces attempted to enter Akabia His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would inevitably be compelled to take such steps as were necessary to prevent or eject them.He had also been told that His Majesty1s Governmentare ready and anxious to consult with him with a viewto the actual delimitation of the frontier betweenKejd and Trans-Jordan, as well as the settlement of all outstanding questions between himself and Trans-Jordan and Iraq, and that they were willing to initiateimmediate negotiations with him or with an accreditedrepresentative, either in London or elsewhere.    Inthe meantime he had been asked to despatch urgentinstructions to secure the withdrawal of any force which may have been despatched against Akaba.   TheOfficer Commanding H.M.S. CORNFLOWER had been told in no circumstances to take active measures against Ibn Saud&apos;forces without further instructions or before the departure of the ex-King.The Cabinet were warned by the Secretary ofState for Air that the active assertion of theauthority of the Palestine Mandate over the Southernportion of Trans-Jordania was a new obligationinvolving a pos sible inorsase in the forces in that region.After considerable discussion * the cabinet agreed -To approve the action already taken todeal with this emergency, but to reserve their decision in regard to any permanentresponsibilities or commitments in these regions until they were furnished by the secretaries of State for the Colonies andfor Air- with farther information as towhat was involved.
MARRIAGEALLOWANCESFOR THENAVY.(previous reference:Cabinet. 24(25) , Con-elusion 4(a).)7.  The Cabinet had before them the followingPapersThe Interim Report of. the Second Committeeon Marriage Allowances for Naval Officers(Paper CP.-259 (25)).    In their Reportthe Committee stated that they were unable to recommend that marriage allow-disturbances should be granted to naval officers as an addition to the emoluments allowedunder present regulations, but addedtheir opinion that in principle some allowance for married officers is right and that if the pay of the three Servicescame under general review some change inthis direction should certainly beconsidered.A Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (Paper CP.-261 (25)) expressing the view that the Report of the Committee&quot;takes so little account of the factspresented to it by the Admiralty, and did so little justice to naval officers, thathe felt bound to appeal to the Cabinet onthe subject.A further Memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty, which was circulatedjust before the Meeting, enclosing aletter,addressed to the Chief Accountantof the Admiralty, from the wife of a naval officer on the East Indies StationIllustrating the difficulties which theFirst Lord had alluded to in his previous memorandum (Paper CP.-269 (25)).In the course of the discussion, attention was drawn to Questions which had been asked in the Houseof Commons and to letters and articles which had appeared in the daily Press just after the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee had been circulated to theCabinet, but it was pointed out that great interest was taken both in the Navy and In the House of commons in this subject, and that there had been earlierQuestions in the House of Commons as well as articles in the Press.A suggestion was made that the Admiralty might find some means to raise the nucleus of a fund, forexample, by the imposition of a duty on alcoholio
liquors consumed in the Navy, or oth&apos;:r means , whichmight &quot;be supplemented by alterations in scales of paythese being subjects which might be considered by theCabinet Committee in pursuance of the second part oftheir Terms of Reference.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the Interim Report of theSecond Committee on Marriage Allow-disturbances for Naval Officers (paper c.P.-259 (25)).
UNEMPLOYMENT^INSURANCE,(Previous*Reference:^Cabinet 25&apos;(25), Oon-clusion 11.)S.  The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of the Cabinet covering the conclusions reached by the Unemployment Insurance Committee(Paper CP.-266 (25)) as the result of their considers-.tion of a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (PaperU. I.

(a reduction of 2d.)Worker     5d.   (a reduction of 2d.)State .     6d. until the end of 1927,. and5^d. thereafter until theend of the deficiency period.These arrangements; it was estimated,would involve an average increase inthe State contribution &quot;of  2;jjj millions a year up to the end of the deficiencyperiod.To approve a further addition to theState contribution of such an amount as would prevent the debt of the Fundrising above the figure- at which it stands, on the 31st December, 1925.This, it was estimated, would involve an extra  1,200,000 in 1926 and  900,000in 1927.To take note that the Minister&apos; ofLabour had already appointed skilledinvestigators on a large scale who^would accumulate material for a Committeewhich might be appointed in the Autumnafter the passage of the Bill.That the Prime Minister, if he thought fit after hearing the views of theMinister of Labour, should have authorityto announce the policy of the Governmentin regard to Unemployment Insurance inhis forthcoming speech at Welbe ck.
