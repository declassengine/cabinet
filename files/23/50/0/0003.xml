GOV.3RN-MENT AT FUTUREMEETINGS OF THEINTERNATIONALLABOURORGANISATION.(l)    That with a view to restricting the futureactivities of the International Labour Organisa-tion within the limits originally contemplated the British Government Representatives,  inapproaching the subjects from time to timeproposed for discussion, either at the conference or at the Governing. Body, should ascertain whether the subjects proposed would normally be dealt with by a British department dealingdirectly with labour or with the specific-labour aspect of general problems, and should normally only assont to the discussion if the answer is in the affirmative.(s)    That before a Conference is invited upon aproposal for a Convention,    the British government representatives should request that there besubmitted to the Conference by each oountrymaterially affeoted by the proposed Convention,a full statement of the industrial positionin the industry ooncerned in each country,the statement in question to be made on theauthority of the Government ooncerned.(3)    That with a view to the effective operationof (2) above the British Government Representa-tives should endeavour to secure -(a)    That the information side of the Office is steadily developed and strengthened as
ngoinst the side of the (Iff Ice resoons xblofor dealing with. prop0- rrahde ;(b )    That in the strengthening of the informationside -(i)    a very careful survey of all publicationsissued should bQ maintained by theGoverning Body; and(ii)    it should be insisted that the provisions in the Standing; Orders should be observed,which require full information to beobtained before subjects are placed onthe Conference Agenda by the governing body, and  that such information is avail-able to the Members of the Governing Bodynot less than a month before the meeting.(4)    That in order to ensure so far as possible the effective carrying out of Conventions by countries whose representatives have agreed to such Conventions,there should be inserted in each future convention a provision to the effect that every State ratifying the Convention shall make an annual return,  setting out precisely all exemptions and exceptions granted under the Convention by the State in question.With regard to Conventions already adopted theGovernment Body should be Invited to prescribe thatthe annual r-reports rendered under Article 408 ofthe Treaty should contain the same information.(5)    That in future Conventions there should besubstituted for the existing common form 10 yearclause   a provision that any party to it shouldbe at liberty to denounce the Convention at anytime after the expiration of the first 5 years by giving reasonable notice.
(&amp;)    That with a view to securing economicaladministration close observation should be kepton the various activities of the Internationallabour Office and a steady pressure exerted  toprevent any further increase in the present rateof expenditure.    V/hile somo Increase ofexpenditure of an automatic character may be unavoidable on certain items,  s.gg salary incre-ments,  every opportunity should be seised for effecting counterbalancing economies.      opportunity-nities of this kind will arise as existingenquiries are brought to an end and when vacanciesccour on the staff from any cause.(7)    (i)    That in future a Bill giving effect tothe terms of a labour Convention should contain a clause to the effect that the Act shallcommence as from the date of the ratification ofthe Convention and shall continue to have effectso long as the Convention shall be binding upon this country.(ii)    That on the introduction of such a Billit should be announced that the Convention willnot be ratified until His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare satisfied that the Convention in question has been or will be ratified by those countrieswhich are the principal industrial competitorswith Great Britain in the field covered by theConvention,  including   in the ordinary courseItaly, France,  Germany and Belgium and anyother country to which the Convention may be specially applicable but not the United Statesof America--
(xii)    That the course indies ted in  (ii) above should he followed by the Government in regardto all future Labour Conventions unless either --(a) There is general agreement between employers and Employed in the industry concerned that the Convention shouldtake effect earlier;    or(b) His Majesty1s Government consider itto be in the national interest ofGreat Britain to legislate irrespective*    of the action of other countries-(iv)    That while in cases where existing british legislation carries out the provisions ofa Convention the British &apos; Government need not bindthemselves in advance not to ratify until othercountries had done so,  the question of delayingBritish ratification in order, to secureratification elsewhere would always be consideredby the? Government of the day.x :    x . -  .x     x     x      x2 &quot;Whitehall Gardens,  S. ?i.7th April, 1925.
