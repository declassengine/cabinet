1. The Minister of Labour reported to the cabinet a serious increase in the number of unemployed,, which amounted to over 100,000 in the last two weeks, sothat the figure had risen to 1,291,200.    This was anincrease of over 200,000 on the corresponding figures at this time last year, although allowance had to bemade for the fact that the extensions of UnemploymentBenefit, made by the Minister of Labour in the late government, had themselves added     considerably to the figure. &apos; Until an analysis of thefigures according to industries was available, it wasimpossible to state exactly where the main increasehad occurred, but it was not improbable that theadditional unemployed were mainly in the coal industry,in regard to which important negotiations were inprogress between representatives of the employers andthe employed.The desirability or otherwise of taking some immediate action, such as an Inquiry Into the rootcauses of unemployment, or into the causes operating in the various trades, was considered.    This discussion was of a-purely preliminary character, and no decisions were taken, but its general trend was to the effectthat any pub lie&apos; inquiry at the present time into the causes of unemployment, either generally or In parti-cular industries, was to be deprecated as liable to interrupt and probably to postpone the very importantnegotiations now beinp carried out between representa-tives of the employers and the employed in various industries, and notably in the coal industry;   thatthe causes of unemployment varied in different branchesof industry, and. at different times, and oftenresulted.from,particular events (such as a shortageof the cotton crop) which specially affected those
industries;   that in most cases these causes hadalready been fully explored as soon as they affected the Industry;   that any general inquiry of a confi-bydential nature,       for example,/the Committee ofCivil Research, into the general oauses of unemploy-ment would inevitably have to take into seriousaccount causes of unemployment in particular indus-tries;   and that it was important for the government not. to take hasty action, which might only result Ininterrupting the efforts of industry itself to. find a remedy and in aggravating and prolonging unemployment.In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for War, as Chairman of the CabinetCommittee-on Unemployment, stated that his Committeewould be considering a Report in the following week.The Minister of Labour mentioned that he was about toplace himself in communication with the Chancellorof the Exchequer in regard to training schemes with aview to some alleviation of unemployment.   TheSecretary of State for the Colonies emphasised the timportance of training from the point of view of empire migration.No proposal was made that the increase in umemployment should be used as an excuse for postponing the decisions already taken by the Cabinet on May 28thfor stiffening, the arrangements in regard to Unemploy-ment Insurance, but there was general agreement thatthe latest developments gave no ground for any changein policy.
