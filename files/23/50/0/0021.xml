In the absence of the Prime Minister, the Pirstf&amp;PUTS.Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Labour, whopvious were engaged in negotiations in connection with theiference:cabinet 40        coal dispute, no further information was available toSI)&apos;)the Cabinet 021 this subject.
2. Owing to the desirability of exceptional secrecyon this subject while negotiations are in progress, theConclusion has, at the request of the Chancellor of theExchequer, been reserved for the present.   Copies willbe circulated later.*
litIr-ALLIED     2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theIs.Cabinet that the question of the French Debt was now aboutIviousIrence:     to reach a vital and critical stage.     The FrenckInet 33I, Con-     Government had sent three experts to London, and M.Caillauxgicn 2.)(the French Finance Minister) was due in London onWednesday next with the hope of achieving a settlement.He himself had had two discussions during the last monthwith M. Fleuriau, the French Ambassador,     without going into details, he had tried to make the Ambassadorunderstand that while the British Government had noobjection to the United States of A&amp;erica giving theFrench Government better terms than they had given tous, we could not agree that France should give morefavourable terms for the repayment of her debt to america than to ourselves;     further, that if the BritishGovernment reached agreement with France before anagreement was reached between France and America, weshould have to insist on a clause entitling us to reopen the question if better terms of payment were accorded tothe United States,The result of the conversations with the Frenchexperts was that the French Government had now made aproposal which, though not satisfactory, was at anyrate serious&apos;.     They assumed that we were paying 35&quot;,000,000 a year to the United States of America,and that, on the &quot;basis that the Dawes payments would realise 75 per cent, of their face value, we shouldreceive  15,000,000 from Germany.     That would leave 20,000,000 to be recovered from other sources.     TheFrench Government were prepared to assume responsibilityfor half of this  20,000,000.     They proposed, to pay 4,000,000 in cash, and 9 per cent, out of the 52 per
mcent, of the total  awes payments to which they were entitled:    that is to say, about  6,000,000 on theassumption that the realised value of the Dawespayments was 75 per cent, of their face value, makinga total of about  10,000,000.     The French expertshad also made a stipulation in regard to a sum of 53,500,000 in gold which had been deposited in thiscountry during the War and had been despatched to theUnited States of America for payments there, and tothe return of which France was entitled only afiter thewhole of her debt to this country had been paid.Insomuch as this amount stood in the credit of theBank of France as an asset, they wished the   BritishGovernment to pay them a sum of about  275,000 annuallyuntil 1984 under this head.These proposals, though not satisfactory, were agreat advance on anything that had been deemed possiblethree years ago.      If we had to refuse them, the french would be entitled to ask us what we proposed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then proposedto the Cabinet that the French Government should beasked to pay a sum of  15,000,000 during the period ofour payments to the United States of America, of which 10,000,000 would be from the resources of Franceherself and   ,000,000 from. France&apos;s share in the Dawespayment s.After some discussion the Cabinet agreedThat the former Chancellors of theExchequer nw in the Cabinet (viz., thePrime Minister, Mr. Austen chamberlain and Mr. lieville Chamberlain), with theSecretary of State for War, should actas a Special Committee to assist theChancellor of the Hixchequer when he required, with a view to working out thedetails of a proposal to the FrenchGovernment based on the plan summarised above, latitude being given to theCommittee to vary the terms to such extent as they might think advisable.- 2 * a * &quot;*
3. At the request of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Cabinet appointed the following committee to give the Foreign Secretary some assistaiioewhich he desired in certain Foreign Office business:-The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State for Foreign -Affairs,The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Chancellor,The Home Seoretary,.The Secretary of State for India,The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
4.  The Cabinet had &quot;before them the following documents:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs covering an aide-memoire by the American Ambassador inregara to the working of the RubberRestriction Regulations.    In the aide-memoire it was urged, inter alia,&apos; thatHie exportable allowance or orucTe rubbershould be increased by 20 per cent,(instead of 10 per cent.) on the 1stAugust,&apos; 1925, and that from now onuntil the amount of rubber in Londonreaches 50,000 tons, rubber in exoessof the exportable allowance should be permitted to be shipped to bondedwarehouses in London for subsequentrelease within exportable allowances(Paper CP.-364 (25)):A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade in regard to representa-tions which had been &quot;made to him by theBritish Rubber Manufacturers,     3 urging that the interests of the manufacturing&apos;&quot;&apos;industry require a much more rapid rateof release of rubber than at present(Paper CP.-369 (25)).The Cabinet were informed that the price of rubber had fallen-materially within the last few days and that the situation would be further relieved tosome extent by the immediate release, under a legal,deoision, of 8,000 tons of non-ooupon rubber.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that he had arranged to hold a meetingthe same afternoon with the Committee which dealt withthese matters, the object of which was to considerthe advisability of an additional 5 per cent, releaseof rubber on November 1st and February 1st.The great financial advantages which had been derived from the Rubber Restriction Scheme, particularlyin connection with the maintenance of the Gold standard and the payment of the American Debt, were stronglyimpressed on the Cabinet.    There was no desire in any quarter to terminate the scheme.
zAfter considerable discussion, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies undertook to consult therepresentatives of the Rubber manufacturing interests on his Committee as to the extent of the advantage which would accrue to the British manufacturing industry by making the additional 5 per cent, releaseoperative for the first time on August 1st instead of on November 1st, and to weigh carefully such advan-tages with the financial and administrative disadvan-tages of taking this course.
jpPLY ANDlNSPORTpANISATION.previousOfererioe:cabinet 6524) j Oon-conclusion 7.)5.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the HomeSecretary circulating a Report by the Supply andTransport Committee containing a brief survey of theposition with regard:to the main emergency arrangements(Paper C.P.-356 (25)).The Home Secretary and the Chief Civil Commis-sloner (the Postmaster-General) gave the Cabinet fallparticulars of the present state of readiness of theSupply and Transport Organisation.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that he proposed to inform the Civil Commissioners at once that persons offering their services for the work of theSupply and Transport Organisation would be doing soin the interest of the community for the purpose ofmaintaining the public services, and that in no waycould they be regarded as strike-breakers.The Cabinet took note of and approved the measures drawn up by the Supply andTransport Organisation, as well as theproposals of&apos; the Home Secretary referredto above-    They were informed that these measures would not be required for thepurpose of dealing with a coal strikebut&apos; only in the event, of complicationswith the railway and transport workers,and that no action would be taken without the approval of the Prime&apos; Minister.

(b) That the interested parties shouldnot be sounded or consulted on thesubject at present:(o) That the Cabinet Coraaittee should beauthorised to consider the draft Billin detail with a view to presenting itdirect to the Cabinet:(d) That the Coimrittee of Imperial defence and the Supply arid Transport Committeeshould be invited to report on theDefenoe aspects of the Weir soheme:(e) That the Weir Report should not, forthe present, be published.-r8-
7. After consideration of a Memorandum by theHome Secretary on the subject of Armistice Day(Paper C.P.-355 (25)), the Cabinet agreed to his proposal that this year&apos;s celebration of Armistice day should be on similar lines to the arrangementsmade last year, and that the Home Secretary shouldbe charged with the duty of any preliminary actionwhich may be required.

12. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that on principle he had felt that the proposalsof the Minister of Pensions in his Memorandum (paper cp.-343 (25)) ought&quot; to have been reserved until theCabinet Committee on Expenditure had had an opportunityof considering them in relation to other plans for economy.    He was, however, satisfied that politicallyit was impracticable to effect economies on the particu-lar aspect of the question dealt with In the Memorandumby the Minister of Pensions, and consequently he had decided to waive his objections.The Minister of Pensions said that in the pen-ultimate paragraph he proposed to substitute the word&quot;lies&quot; for the word &quot;falls&quot; in the passage statingthat &quot;....UO change in the present rates shall be madeHso long as the average cost of living, as certified by&quot;the Minister of Labour, falls somewhere between a given&quot;maximum and minimum figure^1.The Cabinet approved the proposals of&apos; the Minister of Pensions as set forth in his Memorandum (Paper CP.-343 (25)),including, subject to the above amendment,the terms of the statement, which he proposed to make on the subject inParliament, as set forth in paragraph of the Memorandum.
