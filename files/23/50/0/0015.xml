01 71. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that he had received a letterfrom   Lord Crewe, who had just handed the British draft of the proposed quadruple pact to M. Briand.In doing so, Lord Crewe had pointed out that thepivotal idea of the draft Pact was recourse to theLeague of Nations when difficulties arose.   M. Briandhad welcomed this information, which, he said, was hisown central idea.   No discussion of details had takenplace.
BILL.     2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer consulted hiscolleagues as to the excessive dumping*of articles ,on which a Duty was imposed by the Budget,before july 1st, the date on which the Duties took effect.The quantities imported before this date would haveaccounted for almost  2,000,000 of revenue, and nearly four months&apos; importation had been forestalled.It would be possible to collect Duties in regard to.articles falling within the category of the re-imposedMcKenna Duties, but not on silk.    If the former wereenforced,  1,000,000 of revenue might be recovered.On the other hand, on June 24th a statement had beenmade to the effect that it was not proposed to impose the Duty retrospectively from July 1st, and Bome doubt was felt as to whether to do so would be in accord with our treaties with foreign nations.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, on the whole, the loss and inconvenience involved in notimposing the Duties must beaccepted, and they.approved thedraft of an answer to a question in Parliament to this effect whichwas read to them by the Chancellor. of the Exchequer:(b) That the amendment of the BowlesAct, which had rendered possiblethe dumping of articles such ashad recently taken place, shouldreceive consideration.
3. The Cabinet had before them a summary of the.conversations which had taken place between theSecretary of State for India and the Governor-general on the general political situation in India and other subjects (Paper CP.-310 (25)).The greater part of the Meeting was occupied bya long statement by the Governor-General of India inregard to the topics covered in CP. -310-(25)-, includ-ing the general political situation, the ReformsInquiry Report, Indianisation of the Army, theattitude of the Indian Princes, and other matters.A short discussion followed, and the Governor-Generalgave explanations on various points of detail.The Secretary of State for India agreed that,in his speech in the House of Lords on the same after-noon, he would have regard for the Governor-General&apos;desire that no announcement should be made whichexcluded the possibility of the appointment of a RoyalCommission.before December, 1929, which was the latestdate for setting up the Statutory Commission.    TheSecretary of State proposed to make it perfectly clearthat he saw no evidence of a whole-hearted desire onthe part of any large section of the Indian population to co-operate In the scheme of reforms such as wouldjustif?^ him in recommending the appointment of a royal Commission now, but that he would welcome any evidence of a desire to co-operate.    In the meantimeno decision would be taken as to the date of a RoyalCommissL on.The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet,thanked Lord Reading for his very lucid and compre-hensive statement, and welcomed the fact that,considering the circumstances of the day, the governor general was not devoid of hope.
The Seoretary of State for Indiaand the Governor-General consideredthat it was unnecessary to reproducea summary of the Governor-general sStatement, in view of the comprehensive-sive nature of the summary of previous conversations circulatedby the Secretary of State in CP. -310 (25).
