T3R-ALLIEDBIS.previousef erence:abinet1 (25)onclusion1.       The Cabinet were summoned as a matter of urgencyto confer with the Chancellor cf the Exchequer inregard to his negotiations with M. Caillaux, theFrench Minister of Finance, on the subject of theFrench debt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that as a sequel to their previous discussionan offer had been made by the British Experts tothe French Experts based on the Cabinet1s decision;that is to say, for payment of the French debt in62 annual instalments of  L6,0OO,OOO8 composed of 10,000,000 based on the credit of Franceirrespective of the Dawes payments with the additionof a proportion of the French share of the Dawesannuities which might amount to as much as 6,000,000, subject however to the effect on thetotal of certain disputable points of detail and counter-claims.Mo Caillaux had at first refused to come t oLondon with M. Briand to discuss a payment on this basis but, as the result of conversations duringM. Briand&apos;s visit, he had later agreed to visitLondon.     The French Experts had then made an offer of62 annual instalments of  10,000,000 composed of 5,000,000 based on French credit irrespective ofDawes payments and  5,000,000 based on the Dawesannuities.M. Caillaux had increased the offer made through the French Experts to 62 annual payments of  10,000,000 based on the credit of France witha Clause providing for reconsideration if Francedid not receive what she was entitled to expect under-1-
the Dawes Plan.     This was a great advance on any previous offer made by any Prench Government butthere was still a wide gap between it and the offer-approved by the Cabinet.     The British offer wouldhave reduced the total of the Prench debt to approximately one half the original amount;   the prench proposal to about one third.     EventuallyMr* Churchill had informed M. Caillaux that he wasnot in a position to make any definite offer below what had been communicated by the British Expertsand that the furthest point to which he could go wasto recommend to the Cabinet that they should considerpayment of the Prench debt by means of 62 instalmentsof  12-jj- millions on the basis of an agreement, the heads of which are given in Appendix I.     In additionprovision would be made that if the United States ofAmerica, in subsequent negotiations, exacted morefavourable terms from Prance, the agreement would be revised so that Great Britain would not be lessfavourably treated than the United States of America.M. Caillaux appeared to be somewhat disappointedat this proposal.     Apart from French public opinionhis main difficulty was that according to the Prenchcalculations (which we did not entirely accept) he wouldhave to pay  9,000,COO to America for every  6,000,000to the British Empire and a basic figure of  121- million would involve payments by Prance to America for whichhe would be unable to find Dollar exchange. .   just before the meeting Lir. churchill had received a  Tote &apos;Verbale from M* Caillaux, of which a summary isattached in Appendix II.
The Cabinet were informed that M. Caillaux^suggestion that the commencement of the scale of payments should be postponed by one year in each case until 1930(19S9 dropping out), owing to the fact that tho FrenchBudget had already been passed by the Chamber, was probably capable of adjustment more ospeclally as the dates of the French financial year do not correspond withthose of the British,   Probably also, some arrangementcould be made in regard, to M. Calll&amp;ux&apos;s euggpiBticnsas to the French capacity for making transfers across theExchange,   The main difficulty arose in connection withMo Gaillaus^s proposal that tho agreement should be revised if the receipts from Germany did not cover thepayments due to Great Britain and the United States ofAmerica.The Cabinet realised that this latter proposal would,in offset, make the whole of the French payments dependenton the success of the Bawes scheme instead of on Frenchcredit.There was general -agreement that on grounds of general&quot;policy and more particularly on foreign policy, it wasvery important that the present negotiations should notbreak down and should, if possible, result in a settlement,but the majority of the Cabinet were strongly in favourat least of adhering to- their previous decision that/a substantial part of the French payments should be based on French credit,Irrespective of the Lawas payments and without any provisionfor reconsideration of the agreement in the event of aGerman default.As the result of the discussion the Cabinet agreed:-fa)    That 6S annuities of  1&amp;  millions on the sole credit of France mightbe accepted in principle as governing the debt settlement.,   They refusedcategorically to entertain any clause

modifying the.responsibilities of france  in the event of a German- default,They were willing, as an- alternative,to assent to a settlement on the basisof  10 millions on the sole credit of france  and 10 points of Dawes.(b)    That the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who bad arranged an interview withM8 Calll&amp;ux at 5 p.m., should forthwithcontinue the negotiations on this basis.(At 4.45 p.m. the Cabinet adjourned until 6 p.m.On reassembly the same members were present,as before with the exception of the President of theBoard of Trade).The Chanoelior of the Exchequer inf onaed hiscolleagues that be had had a further discussion withM. Caillatuc on the basis of the above decision, andhad made it clear that this was the Cabinet&apos;s last wordin the matter.   M. Calllaux had undertaken to lay theproposal before his Government.M. Caillaux had also agreed to accept a press communique which the Chancellor of the Exchequer then read to the Cabinet and which he himself had acceptedsubject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval,The Cabinet agreed to approve the press communiquein Appendix iii.

APiEHDIX   I.Proposed Main Heads of ^greemexrt.This agreement provides for a settlement of -theWar debts of Prance to Great Britain, with the exceptionof the sum of  53,500,000.    This sum of  53,500,000 shall remain as a non-interest bearing debt, the gold depositedduring the wtr by the Bank of Franco in accordance withthe Calais Agreement being retained without interestagainst this debt.    The French Government shall have theright to redeem this debt under arrangements to be madehereafter after the completion of the payments otherwisedue under this Agreement.2.     The balance of the War Debt of France will be discharged by sixty-two annuities payable half-yearly of 12ir millions   for which France agrees to accept unconditionalresponsibility.3.     nevertheless tho British Government agree to acceptduring the first five years the following reduced annuities;the amounts postponed being added to the payments of later years:-These payments are conditional on a modifiestion ofthe agreement between the 3r.nk of England and the Bank19251926192V19281929 2,000,000 4,000,000 6,000,000 8,000,000 9,000,000of France with regain&apos;d to the repayment of advances madeby the Bank of England and in the absence of such modification, shall not exceed the following amounts:-In the year 1925 2,000,000 4,000,000 4,000,000 5,000,000 6,000,0001926192719281929-6-4./
4.     If at any time before 1935 it appears that thepayment of the annuities provided for in Articles2 and 3will seriously affect the stability of French currency,the French Government, may at its option upon not lessthan ninety dtys notice postpone half of any annuityfor not more than twelve months, provided that the total amount any one time thus postponed shall not exceed theamount of the annuity due for the current year.Any amounts thus postponed shall bear Interest atthe rate of   5 per oont per annum for the period of postponement.The equivalent in French francs of any amounts thuspostponed shall be placed in reserve in a special account in the Bank of France under conditions to be agreed uponhereafter.5. .   In the event, which the contracting parties inno wise contemplate, of the total general failure of payment by Germany under tho Dawee plan, the two contractingparties will consider together, in the spirit of friends and Allies, what modification, if any, in the present agreement is justified.
M. Caillaux explains that be does not put forward any detailed counter propositions to those handed to him by theChancellor as he wishes the vischssions to remain on thebasis of an exchange of views.As however the figure proposed by the Chancellor is ,12-1- millions (which he supposes to mean  12 millions) andthe figure he proposed is  10 millions, the difference isnow comparatively small.Personally, however, and without committing the FrenchGovernment, M. Caillaux might recommend  10 millions plussome points of Dawee.    Such an arrangement would help him in the negotiations with the U.S.A.As regards the first few years,  the Budget of 1925 hasbeen passed by the Chamber and it would have a very unfortunate effect if he had to ask for a Supplementary.   M. Oaillauxsuggests therefore that our scale of payments should be postponed by one year, in each case, till 1930 (19-29 droppingout).But all these questions are much leas important than thatof a revision of the Agreement if German payments are inadequate to meet France1s obligations and that of the possibility of transfers.M. Caillaux explains at considerable length that Francecannot be expeoteci to pay more for her interallied debts than she receives from Germany.   M. Caillaux therefore asks thatit shall be expressly stated that the Agreement will be revisedif the receipts from Germany d.oi not cover the payments due toGreat Britain and IT.S.A.     A similar claim would be inserted in any agreement with U.S.A.(The/APPENDIX    II,Summary of lI,Caiilsux,s Note Verbals (&apos;26th August, 1925).
(The French Government does -aot ask that theAgreement will lapjse entirely in such circumstances:hut merely that it will he revised to the extent requiredby the German failure).As regards the possibility of transfers acrossthe exchange. M. Caillaux wants some provision for independent arbitration as to French capacity if thepower of postponing ijayments proposed by tho Chancellordoes not prove sufficient.   He gives an assurance thata similar stipulation will figure in any Settlement withthe United States of America.
APPENDIX III.^PRESS COaMTHiqPE.The negotiations for the settlement of the Fr enchDebt to Britain, which have been proceeding in one formor another since the beginning of the year, entered upon anew phase three weeks ago when the Cabinet authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to propose to the FrenchGovernment that the net obligation of Prance should inprinciple be halved.     This would have involved payments by France of about  1.6 millions a year during the 62 yearsof the Sritish Debt payments to America.     The basis of the calculations was, how&amp;Ter, affected by the view whichmight be taken upon a number of disputable points of detail and certain counter claims.     Moreover, inaccordaxioe with the Chancellor of the Exchequer1scorrespondence with Monsieur elemental earlier in the year,the British proposals.contemplated a portion of the Frenchpayments being dependent upon the yield of the Frenchshare of the Dawes annuities.In response to this definite and detailed offer,Monsieur Caillaux visited London.     After repeated discussioduring which various alternatives were examined he made the counter proposal that France should pay in principle one-third of her debt to Britain by sixty-two annuities of 10 millions a year, the whole of which should be upon theresponsibility of Prance,   . This proposition constituted a noteworthy advance on all previous tentative suggestionswhiph had been put forward from time to time on behalf ofFrance,     Nevertheless the gap between the British offer toremit one-half and the French proposals to pay one-third,
although, modified, by the exclusion of all reference to the  Dawes Annuities, remained wide and unbrldged.The position is of course further complicated bythe impending negotiations for the settlement of theFrench War Debt to the United States which is greater than their War Debt to Great Britain.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have from the outset made it perfectly clearthat any arrangements which they can come to with Francemust be governed by the principle so often declared thatthey must receive from Prance proportionate and pari passupayments to any Bhe may eventually make to the UnitedStates in the settlement of her War Debt.     It would be noservice to Europe, already so grievously stricken, if the sacrifices of one creditor of France merely conduced to theadvantage of another.       Any agreement which could heentered into between Great Britain and France at the presenttime could, therefore, in this respect be only of a provisional character, pending the outcome of othernegotiations.However, His Majesty&apos;s Government, deeply concernedin the general revival and appeasement of Europe, andfinding themselves in the presence of a sincere and manfuloffer from the Ally with whom they have shared so manytribulations, felt bound to respond to the new proposals.They have therefore authorised the Chancellor of theExchequer to offer finally on their behalf the settlementof the Erench Debt to Great Britain on the basis inprinciple of sixty-two annual payments of  12% millions ayear on the sole responsibility of France, subject to agreement being reached on various matters of detail, andsubject also to the governing condition described above ofthe proportionately equal treatment by France of hercreditors.Monsieur Caillaux while reserving his opinion upon these propositions undertook to lay them before hisGovernment. ,,
