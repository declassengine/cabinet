2. The Cabinet had before them, a memorandum submitted by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, with the concurrence of the First Lord ofthe Admiralty and the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, covering the Minutes of a recent Anglo-Norwegian Conference held in London with a view toan agreement on the subject of Norwegian territorial waters and the protection of the Norwegian fisheryinterests (Paper CP.-339 (25)), together with other documents attached thereto, including the draft of a communication from the British Delegation to theNorwegian Delegation (Appendix II to CP.-339 (25))the draft of a Convention between Norway andGreat Britain regarding the limits of norwegian territorial waters (Appendix III to CP.-339 (25))*and the heads of a draft Fishery Convention (App.IV),In addition, the Cabinet had received orrJuly 14th a Notfe from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs stating that he proposed to act uponthe recommendations contained in the above-mentionedPaper unless any Minister had any objection to thiscourse being taken.The Secretary for Scotland repeated the warn-ings he had given on previous occasions when thismatter had been discussed, to the effect that thisagreement would be severely criticised in Scotlandowing to the fact that It did not exclude foreignfishing vessels from the Moray Firth, although itwould give exclusive rights to Norwegian fishingNorwegianvessels in/areas of far larger extent.   He asked that his protest might be recorded.The Cabinet were informed, however, that ifwe were to admit the extension of the three-mile-limit in the case of the Moray Firth, we should be
similar extension, particularly in the case of Icelandand the Faroe Islands, In which event our own fisherieswould be the first to suffer.The Cabinet we^e * reminded that on a previous occasion it had been decided that if It were desiredto take action for regulating the fishery in the moray Firth, the question should be raised at the&quot;The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs   1 ^s aeapointed out that as recognition of the newterritorial waters of Norway was necessarilyof a general character affecting the whole empire it was a case for previous consultationwith, rather than for subsequent adhesion ornon-adhesion by, the Dominions.&quot; ft,ne orarc attached as Appendix 11 to cp.--339 (25), the effect of whichwould be that His majesty&apos;s Governmentwould offer the Norwegian Governmentthe opportunity of concluding Conven-tions with Great Britain embodying the terms set out in the draft Conven-tion on Territorial Waters, attached as Appendix III to C.P.-339 (25), anda Fisheries Convention embodying thesubstance of Appendix IV to CP.-339 (25)tCb) The above decision to be subject to theresult of a communication to theDominions.

IMOROCCO. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign. affairs informed the Cabinet that the French and Spanish(previous reference: Governments now proposed to make an increase in theCabinet 36(25), Con- numbers of the French and Spanish &quot;Tabors&quot; (unitscfusion 2. )of Native Police- under French and Spanish officersrespectively) for the purpose of maintaining orderin the Tangier Zone pending the organisation of theInternational Gendarmerie $ and had asked tisat GreatBritain, as one of the countries responsible fororder in the Tangier Zone, should bear part of theadditional cost involved.   As we had been under the unfortunate necessity of opposing everything whichthe French and Spanish Governments had proposedin regard to Tangier, he asked for authority, inthe last resort, to agree to bear one-third of theoost involved, which was estimated at about  30,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had considered that,as a Supplementary Estimate would be necessitated,there should be a Cabinet decision on the matter.The Cabinet approved the general line proposec.by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,namely, that he should point out that the increaseof the &quot;Tabors&quot; to double their present nominalforee, as proposed/was rather large, but should agree to an increase provided the French and spanish Governments would bear the cost.   TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs was given authority, in the last resort, to offer to bearone-third of the cost of the Inorease.
4. The Cabinet had before them, as a matter of urgency, a Memorandum by the Home Secretary in regardto the Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports)Bill, in which he gave the results of a privateconference he had held with representatives of thePress, and explained that Lord Darling had introduced in the House of Lords a Bill which was understood tobe in the same terms as Lord Evelyn Cecil&apos;s Bill,and which was down for Second Reading in the Houseof Lords the same afternoon (Paper CP.-347 (25)).The Cabinet agreed  That the spokesmen of the Governmentin the House of Lords should statethat the Government saw no objectionto a Second Reading, but could notpromise facilities for the passage ofthe Bill at the present time.
5. The Meeting of the Cabinet arranged forFriday, July 17th, at 11-30 a. m. was postponed.2,-Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 16, 1925,
