The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies in regard tothe report of the League of Nations Boundary Comrais-sion on the question of the Iraq Frontier (Paper CP. -385 (25)).    The gist of the final conclusion of theReport, as stated in the Secretary of StateMemo-.randum, was that the weight of economic and geographicalarguments, as well as the sentiments of the majorityof the inhabitants of the territory, taken as a xvhole,operate in favour of the union with Iraq of the wholeterritory south of the &quot;Brussels line&quot;, 1.e., thepresent frontier.    Tills conclusion, however, was subject to the following conditions:-(i) The territory must remain under the effective mandate of the League ofNations for a period which may beput at 25 years:(ii) Regard must be paid to the desiresexpressed by the Kurds that theadministration of the Kurdish areas should be conducted by Kurdishofficials in the Kurdish language.If, on the other hand, all League of Nations controlwere to cease on the expiry of the four years&apos; treaty between Great Britain and Iraq in the sunaier of .1928, and if no guarantees of local-administrationwere given to the Kurds, then the Commission believedthat the majority of the population would preferTurkish to Arab sovereignty;,   adding that they themselves also consider that it &quot;vvould be more advantageous in these circumstances for the territory to remain under the sovereignty of Turkey, &quot;whoseinternal conditions and external political situationare incomparably more stable than those of Iraq&quot;.
*1 ey ei)The League of Nations Commission had furtherreported that in that event they would give the wholeof the Mosul Vilayet to Turkey, reserving only forIraq a small portion in the region of the Upper Dialawhich is necessary for carrying on the irrigationschemes on that river.The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave the Cabinet full particulars of the proposals of theLeague of Nations Boundary Commission.     In thecourse of his statement he mentioned that the secondcondition imposed by the League of Nations commission had been complied with as the Iraq Administration hadalready placed the administration of Bhrdish areasunder Kurdish Officials and it was conducted in theKurdish language.The Cabinet were informed that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, who was unable to be present at the meeting, agreed with Mr. Anery&apos;s conclusions in his memorandum (CP, 385 (25)).The, Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that from a defence point of view the issue laybetween the present frontier as proposed by the IraqComm&amp;ssion and either clearing out altogether from Iraqor falling back to Basra, since the partition frontierproposed as an alternative by the League of nations commission could not be defended.
The Cabinet were informed that the policy proposed by the Colonial Secretary would involve no obligation to defend Iraq against Turkey greater than was involved in the present Mandate.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for the colonies that the British representatives atthe Council of the League should state that before the present IraqTreaty expires we propose, as.provided in the Iraq Treaty, toreplaoe it by one of longer durationwhich will safeguard in the MosulVilayet those conditions of reasonablegood government and consideration forlooal sentiment subject to which theCommission consider that the presentfrontier is the right one.(b) That whenever this decision was announced a public announcement shouldalso be made in this country to theeffect that this policy did not involve any additional expense&quot;beyond what had previously been contemplatedand that it was hoped for a steadydownward trend of expenditure year by year.
Urn use opI the severnI as a source! of electrical! power.(previous reference:Cabinet 43(24).)4.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council summarising theresults of the preliminary Investigations into thedesirability of attempting to use the Severn Estuaryas a source of electrical power.    The Severn BarrageCommittee appointed by the Department, of scientific and Industrial -Research (to whom this investigationhad been, entrusted) had reported that the geological,evidence pointed to the conclusion that satisfactoryfoundations for a barrage exist and that a barragecould be erected.    The question for the Cabinet todecide j therefore, was as to whether the next stage of the investigationj estimated to oost about 28,200, should be proceedsd with (Paper CP.-382The Cabinet agreed.-(a) That the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty -should enquire and report to thenext meeting of the Cabinet as towhether the next stage of theinvestigat ion cbuld be carried out&quot;by the Admiralty HydrographicService by postponing other surveywork until the next financialyear bo that although the admiralty would be recouped for their expenditure from the funds allotted to the Severn Barrage enquiry, hoadditional State expenditure wouldbe involved.(b) That apart from (a)* the future ofthe investigation should he(25).)
