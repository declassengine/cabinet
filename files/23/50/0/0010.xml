AFGHANISTAN.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(25), Con-clusion 1. )1. The Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments in regard to Afghanistan:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (Paper C.P,-286 (25)):A Note by the Secretary of State forIndia, covering telegraphic correspond-ence regarding the recent execution inKabul of an Italian subject, Piparno(Paper CP.-301 (25)),After a short introductory statement by theGovernor-Secretary of State, the/General of India made a full statement to the Cabinet In regard both to our generalpolicy in Afghanistan and to the Piparno case.    GenerallyGgvern^rjthe/general&apos;s statement confirmed the material containedin the Memoranda quoted above, which he supplemented incertain details.In regard to general policy in Afghanistan, the issues before the Cabinet may be summarised as follows: -In view of the activity of the Soviet Government andthe extent of their gifts and subsidies to the Amir of afghanistan, should the Indian Government adopt thepolicy of subsidies?   If so, should the subsidies begiven in kind or in cash?   If in kind, should the subsidytake the form of the development of the Khyber-Eabulroad,    or some other form?   Would a subsidy in kindprovide an efficient counterpoise to cash subsidiesgiven by the Russian Soviet Government to the Amir,who is in financial straits and unably to pay in fulleither his army or the subsidies of the Tribal Chiefs?Having regard to the fact that the Amir&apos;s interests arefundamentally v-lth the Indian Government, who desire tomaintain him on the throne, rather than with the SovietGovernment5 who would undoubtedly avail themselves ofany opportunity to upset him, might it not be better topay a subsidy in cash to the Amir, notwithstanding the-1-
much greater cost involved and the risk of a compe-tition in subsidies with the Soviet Government?Whether the subsidy is given in cash or in kind, should it be limited for the moment to a single year, or should the British Minister at Kabul be given tounderstand that it -wilt be continued for several years, provided that on each occasion the Governmentof India were satisfied that its payment was justified?Should the discussions in regard to the subsidy be postponed until after the settlement of the questions arising out of the Piparno incident?In regard to the Piparno case there was generalagreement that the demands made by the Italian Govern-ment on the Amir were drawn up without regard to conditions in Afghanistan;    that the Amir would be bound to refuse them since acceptance would cost himhis throne;    that, if pressed, they could only resultin a withdrawal of the Italian representative fromKabul (which would not be very serious to Italy);   butthat if we were to associate ourselves with these demands they could only result in withdrawal of ourown Minister from Kabul, which could not be contemplated.While there was general agreement that we could not support joint international action in support of theItalian demands, it was nevertheless recognised thatIt was indispensable to take some action to ensure the elements of justice and fair trial to foreigners in afghanistan, and that this could best be accomplishedby simultaneous (but not joint) action by the reprssen-tatives of the western Powers at Kabul, such action being kept independent of, and separate from, the,Italian demands.
Towards t.uo end. of the discussion the question was raised as to whether, in view of the activity of theRussian Soviet Government in sending aviators to afghanistan, the British policy of abstaining from any form of aerial assistance to the Amir should be re-&apos;Considered.After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed  (a) In regard to the Piparno incident,that&apos; &quot;the Secretary of State for Indiaand the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should concert telegrams to.be sent by the latter -(i) To Rome, explaining to theItalian Government&quot;how detri-mental it would he to our.position in Afghanistan tosupport their demands at Kabul,and, while taking a sympatheticattitude towards&quot;the Italiandifficulties , setting forth thepolicy we propose to&quot;adopt inorder to secure the elements ofjustice and fair trial forforeigners in Afghanistaoa:(ii) To the British Minister at Kabul,   -in regard&apos; to the attitude he was  -to take up in this matter:(b) That the policy of a subsidy to the Amirshould be approved&apos; in principle, and thatall details, including the form of thesubsidy, the terms on which it should begranted, and the proper moment for raising the question, should be left tothe Secretary of State for India andthe Governor-General:(o) That, for the moment, there should be nochange in policy as regards aerial assist-ance to the Amir, but that the situation should be kept under careful observationwith a vie-, to re-consideration of thepolicy if this should prove necessary or desirable.Gevernor-Tho Prime Minister thanked the /General for theassistance he had given to the Cabinet in this delicatematter.
CHINA.2. The Prime Minister read to his colleagues aThe Situation   telegram handed to him by the Secretary of State forWar from the General Officer Commanding at Hong-Kong(previous reference:Cabinet 39(24), Con-clusion 8.)0182 Cypher 22/6) to the effect that a strike had begun at Canton and Hong-Kong;   that all precautionshad been taken and Hong-Kong volunteers mobilised 400strong;    that the situation was quiet and in hand.-4-
3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gavehis colleagues an account of the developments of thesituation in regard to the proposed Security Pact sincethe matter had last been discussed at the Cabinet,which had led to Mr Austen Chamberlain&apos;s despatch(after receiving telegraphic approval from the PrimeMinister on behalf of his colleagues) to M. Briand,dated   &quot;Geneva, June 8, 1925&quot; (Cmd.2435 No. 8), and ultimately to the French Government Mote to the Gerxr&amp;nForeign Minister on June 16 (Cud. 243-5 No. 9).There followed a discussion in which were raised the various points on which public opinion inGreat Britain and the Dominions, as well as in France,had evinced a desire for further explanations.    TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs was able to showgenerally that the proposed Paot could not be invokeduntil after the procedure of arbitration or conoilia-tion provided by the Covenant of the League of nations had been exhausted.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,informed his colleagues that he hoped to circulatealmost immediately an explanatory Memorandum, prepared in the Foreign Office, in whioh all t?ae differentcontingencies in which the pact might be invoked were examined, and the extent of the liabilities of theBritish&apos;nation in each case set forth.    A little laterhe hoped to circulate the draft of a pact which, after examination and eventual approval by the Cabinet, mightbe transmitted for the consideration of the FrenchGovernment, who were anxious to press on with thismatter.

The Cabinet had again under consideration theMemorandum by the President of the Board of Tradecovering the application from the Iron and Steel industry for an Inquiry under the Safeguarding of Industries Acts(Paper CP,-292 (25)).The Cabinet were informed that,in the course of discussions between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade , a proposal had been made for a comprehensive Inquiry into theIron and Steel Industry unconnected with the Safeguard-ing of Industries Acts.    The advantage of this plan wasthat it might avoid the risk of raising the whole Tariffissue in its widest form, which, it was explained, couldscarcely be escaped if the question was consideredunder the terms of the Safeguarding of Industries Acts.Further, the proposed Committee or Commission wouldhave to take into- account the vital importance of theIron and Steel Industry in the matter of national and imperial defence, which might be found to justify state assistance in some form other than that of a customs duty.The President of the Board of Trade handed roundduring the Meeting a draft Terms of Reference and Letterto the Chairman of the proposed Iron and Steel Committee(Appendix).&apos;The Cabinet adjourned the Meeting. in order to give time for furtherconsideration of the proposals con-tained in the Appendix to these conclusions.

A P P g 11 D i 1.IHOM AMI) COMMITTflfi.Suggest ad Terms of Preference.To be a Committee to enquire into and report upon theposition and prospects of -the Iron and Steel Industries(other than Engineering snd Shipbuilding)    and to make recommendations as to any action   whether by the impositionof duties or otherwise   which may appear desirable endpracticable in all the circumstances.
Draft letter to Chairman of committee as you have consented to preside over the Committeewhich the Government has asked to make a very importantenquiry into the Iron and Steel Industry,    I should like toelaborate the general terms of reference which the Committeehave been given.As you ore aware, the Board of Trade have received a combined application under the Safeguarding of industries procedure from groups of manufacturers included in theNational Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers,  coveringPig Iron, Steel, Wrought Iron, and iVire, Wire Netting andWoven Wire.--   In considering this application the followingfacts are necessarily present to the mind of the Government.The Iron and Steel Industry is not only a very largeemployer of labour, but it is also of vital importance tothis country, both in Peace and in V/ar.    No Government could contemplate without serious alarm the prospect of anysubstantial pert of this industry boing put out of actionor reduced to a state in which it could not supply thecountry with its essential requirements.Moreover, the fortunes of many other industries are largely dependent upon that of the Iron and Steel Industry.On the one hand,  it is a very large consumer of coal and thesuccess of coal mining is therefore closely linked with thesuccess Of Iron and steel.On the. other hand,  it supplies,  in one stage or another,materials required by many other essential industries.

II!Draft letter to Chairman of CprnrqitteeAs you have consented to preside over the Committeewhich the Government has asked to make a very importantenquiry into the Iron end Steel Industry,    I should like toelaborate the general terms of reference which the Committeehave been given.As you ore aware, the Board of Trade have received a combined application under the Safeguarding of industries procedure from groups of manufacturers included in theNational Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers,  coveringPig Iron,  Steel, Wrought Iron, and v/ire,  Wire Netting andvVoven v:/ire.    In considering this application the followingfacts are necessarily present to the mind of the Government.The Iron and Steel Industry is not only a very largeemployer of labour, but it is also of vital importance tothis country,  both in Peace and in tfsr.    No Government could contemplate without serious alarm tho prospect of anysubstantial pert of this industry boing put out of actionor reduced to a state in which it could not supply thecountry with its essential requirements.Moreover, the fortunes of many other industries are largely dependent upon that of the Iron and Steel Industry.On the one hand, it is a very large consumer of coal and thesuccess of coal mining is therefore closely linked with thesuccess Of iron and steel.On the oth?r hand, it supplies, in one stage or another,materials required by many other essential industries.    Inthis connection there aro two factors of almost equalimportance.    In the first place,  those industries which use the products of iron and steel would be placed, in a precarious position if the iron and sat eel resources of this
country were unable to   iee t a large part of their requirement a.In the second place, it is of the utmost  importance to those industries that they should be able to receive their supplies of iron and steel on terms which do not prejudicethem in the competition that they have to face in the homeand overseas markets.The national importance of the Iron and Steel industry has been recognised by every Committee which has concerneditself either with that Industry or with the wider problemof British industry generally.The facts disclosed in successive trade returns, in theproduction statistics of the iron and steel industry, andthe circumstances with regard both to employment and to financial conditions, which are common knowledge, allemphasise the seriousness of the present position and theimportance of any practicable action being taken to place it on a more eatiafactory footing.In considering the application made to them, theGovernment have felt that a wider enquiry than that suggested to them should be undertaken.     If an enquiry were granted under the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure the Committeewould obviously have to consider exhaustively the effect of a duty not only upon the Iron and Steel Industry and itsdifferent sections, but upon all those industries whichuse iron and steel in their manufactures.      Such an enquiry would undoubtedly present many difficult problems, and ifas the result of their investigations the Committee found thatthe conaition of the Iron and Steel Industry and thecompetition shich it has to face called for immediate action, hut that the nature and extent of the repercussions-sionof a duty upon other industries precluded the recommendationof a duty, while the facts would have been disclosed, thelimitation of their terms of reference would have precludedthe Committee from making any alternative suggestions.     The
Government feel that so restricted an enquiry would not hein the national interests, or in the interests of the steel industry.     They have, therefore, invited your committee to undertake a wider enquiry which, while itwill to a large extent survey the same field as under the safeguarding of Industries procedure, will empower them tomake any recommendations, cumulative or alternative, whichthe review of the industry and its relation to otherindustries may show to he necessary.-4-
If it were desired to add to the letter, which wouldhe publishedj  a more detailed analysis of.the scope of theenquiry and the remedies which it would he open to theCommittee to consider,  it would, I think, be necessary toinclude the following:(I)   Protective Duties..(II)    Subsidies   - on production- on exports generally,- on particular contracts,- on coal consumed,- on railway rates.(Ill)    Improvement of industrial and commercialorganisation -increased consolidation of undertakings,combined organisation for foreignmarketing.(IV.)    Reorganisation of works and improvement of equipment with state financial aid,and combined investigation of scientific andtechnical, problems with state co-operation and financial aid.(V)     Agreements with large consumers on the basisof reasonably stable prices for substantial-   periods.I, II, IV invole State action   -   II and IV State financial aid   -   and III and V are matters essentially for theindustry itself.It will probably be considered that the publication of so much detail would be undesirable. ,
