(This Document isrthe Property of His britannic  j e sTy^stroke ve rnment. &quot;T-  P,  TH] 0 RT -CABINET 26 (25),CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.1, onWEDNESDAY, MAY 20th, 1925, at 11-50 a.ra.PERSIA.Attitude of soviet Russia,towards.(previous reference:Cabinet 51(24), Con-conclusion 2.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to telegram No.118 fromSir Percy Loraine, the British Minister at Teheran,dated May 16th, reporting the anxiety of the PrimeMinister of Persia regarding the situation In Khorassan,where Persian Turcomans, who are said to have beenjoined by others from Russian territory, had surroundedPersian troops on three sides.    Sir Percy Loraine had previously reported that this was probably part of a plan by Soviet Russia to breed a revulsion of the growing;feeling in Persia in favour of good relations withGreat Britain (Telegram No. 108).    In his latest commu-communication,   Sir Percy Loraine reported that the PersianPrime Minister had indicated that if ratters went badlyhe might be driven to ask for British assistance, onthe ground of mutual interest in preventing any Russianmovement southwards in East Persia.    Sir Percy Loraine,in reply, had told the Persian Prime Minister that the sympathy&apos; of His Majesty.&apos; s Government would be with thePersian Government in preserving their authority inKhorrasan, but that they would strongly dislike being
involved in the natter, and that, if they-were , there salt would he bad for Persia as well as for GreatBritain.    The Persian Prime Minister had agreed, andhad asked him to transmit his message, making it olearthat the eventuality to which he referred was an extremeone and would only arise in the event of overt Russianhostility.Subject to a small addition, which was accepted by the Secretary of State, theCabinet approved the draft reply whichwas read to them by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and which is&apos;attached in the Appendix.The Secretary of State undertook to keepthe Cabinet fully informed of any devel-opments which might arise in this situa-tion.The Secretary was instructed to enquireas to which Department had prepared a map (which was mentioned to the Cabinet)shoeing the various Soviet Republicswhich had been set up under the auspices of the Russian Soviet on the borders of afghanistan and Turkestan, and to arrangefor its circulation to the Cabinet.

HONOURS 4.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(PREVENTION5   OF ABUSES)      Lord Privy Seal in which it was pointed out that, afterBILL.the question of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Bill(Previous had be en considered by the Cabinet, it&apos; had been foundReference:Cabi.net 24 that a Bill with this object had actually been introduced(25J, Con-elusion 14.)   into the House of Lords under Mr Bonar Law1s Governmentand had been passe;;, through that House and sent to the commons;    that, in these circumstances, the. Prime... Minister had authorised the Lord Privy Seal to modify the answer previously approved by the Cabinet, whichwas no longer appropriate, and that the modified answerhad been given in reply to Lord Selborne in the follow-ing form:-,!.. o your Lordships will remember that a Bill,with this object was passed through yourLordships1 House under Mr Bonar Law1sGovernment in 1923, but was not proceeded with in the House of Commons. &apos; The matter-has, of course, been under the considera-tion of the present Government apain and theGovernment hope to propose legislation withthe same object without delay, after havingcarefully considered its terms.    I ought to add that, in the present condition of &quot;public business, I am not sure thgt I can hold out any great hope that there will be sufficient time in the House of Commons for the Bill topass through all its stages.   So far, however,as this House is concerned, there ought to beno difficulty.&quot;The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of and approve the aboveanswer given by the Lord Privy Seal:(b) That the Honours (Prevention of Abuses)Bill, 1923, should be referred, in thefirst instance, to the Committee of HomeAffairs.
EAST AFRICA. 5. The Lord President of the Council drew theReport of attention of the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency, to a&apos;L the East^Africa Com- Debate which was to take place in the House of Lordsmission.the same afternoon in regard to the Report of the EastResearch into referred&quot;Sleeping Africa Commission (Cmd.2387); ho / more particularlySickness&quot;.to the question of the tsetse fly and the need for scientific research into the question of sleepingsickness, which were dealt with, inter alia, in theReport.    In the course of his obseivations the lord president of the Council drew the attention of theCabinet to the following considerations:-(i) That a Commission of the League ofNations was meeting that very day inLondon, under the Chairmanship, of theParliamentary Under-Secretary for theColonies j and was considering a pro-posal that a League of nations Inquiry.should be set up to investigate thequestion of sleeping sickness;   thatin some quarters there was a desire that this investigation should be under the Chairmanship of a Germansavant;    but that apparently GreatBritain (including the Colonies con-cerned) would be asked to undertakeabout 90 per cent, of the expenditure( 27,000 out of an estimated&quot; 30,000).(ii) It appeared from the Report of the EastAfrica Commission that, from the pointof view of research, the British recordin Tanganyika might be exposed to criticism by an international Commission,insomuch as, from reasons of pressingeconomy following the &quot;War, it had beenfound necessary to suppress the research establishment previously maintained bythe Germans.(iii) That, as Chairman of the Medical research council, it had been represented to him that the Government machinery for apply-in g the results of medical research inthe administrative sphere throughoutthe British Empire was defective;   that. before taking office he had written aletter to the Prime Minister on thissubject;    and that since he had takenoffice the Prime Minister had asked him., to advise as to the proposals now before&apos; the Cabinet in regard to foresight and.. co-ordination in economic inquiry(Paper C, P. -105 (25)), with which our  .deficiencies in regard to the applica-tion of research appeared .to be closely connected.
In the course of the discussion, attention was drawn to the fact that the Report of the East AfricaCommission, though communicated to members of theCabinet in their capacity of Members of parliament as a Parliamentary paper, had not been brought to their notice as a natter of special interest from the pointof view of the Cabinet, and that the Cabinet hadreceived no information in regard to the League ofNations Commission now sitting in London.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in view of the smallness of the contribution which foreign nations wouldmake towards the proposed Inquiry onSleeping Sickness, it would be prefer-able for. the British Government toundertake the Inquiry itself and tocommunicate the results to the Leagueof Nations, and that the scope and&quot;cost of the Inquiry should be discussed in the usual way between the ColonialOffice and the Treasury before action was taken:(b,) That the Lord President of. the council should be authorised to announce in theHouse of Lords, if the course of the debate should render this desirable,the intention of the Government to prosecute an Inquiry into Sleeping-sickness:(c) That the Secretary should circulate theReport of the East Africa Commission asa Cabinet Paper.
6. The Cabinet had before them the proposals of aCabinet Committee in regard to the Terms of Referenceto the proposed Commission of Inquiry on juvenile unemployment (Paper Co P.-247 (25)).  It was suggested to the Cabinet that the questionrequired further consideration from the point of vieweither of including Scotland within the scope of the inquiry or of setting up a corresponding Inquiry forScotland j and that the composition of the proposed commission also required careful consideration in order-to avoid the risk of proposals involving heavy demands on the Exchequer.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Cabinet Committee should beasked to consider the composition ofthe proposed Commission of inquiry and Its application to Scotland, andto re-examine the Terms of reference in the light of their discussion onthese subjects:(b) That the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary for Scotland shouldbe added to the Cabinet Committee andthat the Minister of Health should withdraw, so that the revised com- -position would be as follows:-The President of the Board of Education(In the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Minister of Labour,The President of the Board of Trade,The Secretary for Scotland.

THE DISEASESOP ANIMALSBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 13(24), Con-clusion 1 &amp;Appendix).8. After con side ration of a Memorandum &quot;by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries, covering adraft of the Diseases of Animals Bill (Paper 0.P.-241 (25)), together with the Conclusions of theCommittee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C. 12th conclusions  (25), Para. 2), the Cabinet agreed  To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of commons of the Diseases of Animals Billin the form of the draft annexed to CP.-241 (25), subject to the insertion of the necessary drafting the BilltovNorthexri- ]freland-j with a viewto the passage into law of theBill before the Summer adjournment.
WAR PENSIONS. 9. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Pensions in regard to the proposals of theI (Previousv Reference: British Legion on the subject of War Pensions (W.P. C.&apos; Cabinet 25(25) , Con- (25) 2) , together with the Report of a Cabinet Committeeelusion 6. )thereon (Paper CP.-250 (25)).Subject to the condition mentioned below,/ the Cabinet approved the general Conclusions ofthe War Pensions Corardttee, which are set forth in thefollowing&apos; paragraphs of their Report:-fl2.    The Committee are in agTeement withthe conclusions reached by&apos;the Ministerof Pensions in a Memorandum (W.P.C.(25)2 ,circulated,to the Committee.    The Com-mittee find that the proposals made bythe British Legion would&apos; involve funda-mental alterations in the principles ofwar pensions which, have been approvedby successive Governments and Parliamentsand would seriously affect in the future the fjuaanoial liabilities of the State;and they agree with the position adoptedby the late Government in correspondence with the Ministry that 1 They cannotcontemplate any material departure fromthe fundamental principles on which thepensions system of this country has been for so long- establishedf (Treasury Letter29/2/24 - Po7172.)3.    In these circumstances the Committeeexpress their entire agreement with theannouncement made by the Prime minister that the appointment of a Select Commit -tee to consider these and other proposalsfor extension of the Warrants and WarPensions Acts would not be justified(Hansard, 26th March, 1925 - Cols.599-600).4.   The Committee further think that thepractice of dealing with exceptional casesunder the Dispensing Warrant should becontinued for&quot; the present.    The treasury and the Ministry of Pensions are in con-sultation on this particular matter.&quot;In view, however, of the fact that the report had only been in the hands oi members of the Cabinet ashort time before the Meeting&apos;, it was further agreed  That if any Minister, on studying thematter closely, felt dissatisfied, heshould communicate with the Secretary,who should ask the Prime Minister tohold a special Meeting of the Cabinetto consider the question on the after-noon of Monday next, May 25th.Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,May 20, 1925.
