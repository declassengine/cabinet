(Tills Document Is the Property of His BrltannioMa^^esby^s&quot;&apos; &apos;GpTeriamenV*)T -CABINET 28 (.35).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the cabinet held at 103 Downing Street, S.W, 1, onWEDNESDAY, JUNE 10 s 1925, at 11-30 a.ni.1. The Secretary of State for India, made a prelim-inary statement to the Cabinet in regard to the presentposition in Afghanistan and our policy in that country-In the absence of the Seoretary of State for ForeignAffairs and of the Viceroy, whom he hoped the cabinet would agree should be invited to a discussion of thisquestion. Lord Birkenhead liniited himself to the salient factors of the situation, with a   view to givin^his colleagues a general knowledge of the subject beforthey received a comprehensive Memorandum which he wasabout to circulate.The Secretary of State recalled that a fewyears ago, on the conclusion of hostilities withAfghanistan, a Treaty of good understanding had been entered into with the Amir.    This Treat?/ was liableto denunciation by either party at twelve months1notice, but up to the present time neither party had given notice of a desire to terminate.During the last year or two several new factorshad been introduced into the situation.    The policyof the Amir had antagonised important Moslem sections
of his subjects j with /the result that there had recently,been a serious insurrection.    It was only with diffi-culty that this movement had been crushed, and one section was still standing out.    It was clear, however.,that the Amli^s personal position was less stable1 thanwhen he ascended the throne.Another new factoor had been a great increase inthe penetration of Afghanistan by the Russian Soviet   &apos;propaganda.    Not only had the countries bordering onAfghanistan adopted the Soviet system of government(and in this connection attention was drawn to&apos;the maprecently circulated to the Cabinet), but there hadbeen an Increasing infiltration of agents, and the amir had been induced to accept the services of Russianiaviators.    Every effort was being made to seduce the amir from British influence, tut at present there wasno reason to believe that these efforts had been successful or that the Amir was not alive to the certainty that the Soviet representatives would drop the mask and throw him over when the moment came,with a&apos; view to substituting in Afghanistan their ownsystem of government.Our policy up to the present time had been toencourage the Amir to oppose the infiltration of theSoviet agents and propaganda, and to keep him wellaffected towards ourselves.In view, however, of the large sums beingspent by the Soviet in Afghanistan, it appeared thatsome counter action, involving a certain amount ofexpenditure, would be requiredj end it would be forthe Cabinet to consider the principles on which suchaction should be based.
Another factor, at present of secondaryimportance? was a tendency on the part of theGermans to carry out a commercial penetration of afghanistan.The Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for India, briefly summarised above, and agreed  (a) That,&apos; after receipt of the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Indiaand after the return of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, theyshould discuss the question of policy towards Afghanistan, in the light ofthe new factors.(b) That the Viceroy of India should beasked to be present at the discussion.
1^1fit tjFOREIGN AFFAIRS.       2. The Prime Minister read to Ills colleagues a security. letter written from Geneva by the Secretary of StateMr Chamberlains   for Foreign Affairs to Sir William Tyrrell, givingLotted-an account of various conversations with M. Briand,-&apos;in which the following questions were alluded to:-(previous reference: Security and the Allied Note.Cabinet 27(25) , Con- German approaches to the Polishelusion 3. ) Government on the question of security.Encouragement given by M. Briandto the Poles to come to terms withRussia.Probable postponement, pending thedevelopment of the question of security, of the consideration ofthe system of investigation to beapplied by the Council&apos; to the demilitarisation of the Rhine zone.The situation in the Balkans, In-cluding a proposal that Mr chamberlain and M.&quot;Briand should arrange an inter-,ohange of views with sign of Mussoliniwith a view to establishing tranquilityin those regions.The present policy of the russian soviet Government, namely, to carryout subversive propaganda in OverseaPossessions of the Western countries.Turkey.Allied Debts.Suggestions by M. Briand for changesin the Covenant, including an enlarge-&apos; ment of the Council of the Leagueafter the admission of Germany.&quot;In the course of a short discussion which followed the reading of this letter, attention was drawn to areport in &quot;The Times&quot; that- in the Dominion House ofCommons Mr Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister ofCanada, had stated that Canada was not a party to theproposed Security Pact.The Cabinet were informed that the dominions had been kept fully notified of all developments,apart from the invitation which had been sent to t hemto attend a Conference for the discussion of the geneva protocol.
UNEMPLOYMENT. 3. The Cabinet had before then the following docu-The Scottish      ments in regard to the Scottish Oil Shale Mines:-Oil ShaleMines. The Report of the Unemployment Committee,dated March: 27, 1925, as &quot;submitted at theprevious consideration of the question(Previous (Paper CP.-184 (25)).Reference:Cabinet 20 A Memorandum by the President of the Board(25), Con-N of Trade, reporting full information as toelusion 6.) the position&quot;of the Scottish Shale\0ilCompanies;   pointing out that as theAdmiralty are not anxious to obtain the.Companies&apos; oil at present and do notattach any considerable Importance tokeeping the &quot;mines in existence, the onlyground for giving assistance is to preventthe unemployment which would be caused byclosing&apos; the mines and works;    explaining;the objections to giving such assistance-to the Oil Shale Companies on which otherindustries in a. worse condition couldfound a claim to a subsidy;    and pointing-out that the only ground on which a subsidy to the shale mines &quot;could be justifiedwould be that the Government were usingpart of their profits in the successfulAnglo-Persian venture to relieve distressin&quot;a kindred undertaking in which they arealso interested and which forms part of alarger enterprise (Paper CP. -275 (25)).A Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland,suggesting that jbefors the question issettled, an effort should be made to obtain.further information as to which mines wouldprobably be closed in the event of the :Companies being left to their own resources,so that the full effect on the unemploymentposition could be measured (Pacer 0. P.-279 (25))..The question was adjourned for .further consideration.
SUGGESTEDAGRICULTURALSURVEY.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(25) , oon-clusion 5, )4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries in which he proposed to reject the complete survey of agriculturalconditions and possibilities of the country proposedduring the Debate in the House of Commons on theAgricultural Returns Bill on April 8th, which would cost  100,000, and to carry out instead a. more modestprogramme in connection with the compilation of theagricultural section of the Census of Production,which should not. cost more than  10,000 (Paper CP. -282  (25)).The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesexplained that he did not propose to make a statement at all unless he was asked to do so, but if a question was asked he v/ould like authority to reply on the linesof the draft statement attached to CP.-282 (25).The Cabinet agreed  To approve the general lines of thestatement proposed by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries, subject toprior consultation with the Secretaryfor Scotland with a view to correspond-ins: action in the two countries, andsubject to no additional expenditurebeing incurred beyond that already provided for in the Estimates of theDepartment for 1925-26, withoutfurther reference to the Cabinet.
TEE EFFECT OFTHE INCREASEOF DEATHDUTIES ONAGRI CULTURALINTERESTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(25), Con-clusion 1.)5. The CabineB had before them a Report by theCabinet Committee which had been asked to consider thequestion of. the effect on agricultural interests ofthe arrangements Incorporated in the Finance Billfor the increase of death duties and the relief ofsuper-tax, with a view, if possible, to some allevia-tion to those interests (Paper CP.-284 (25)).The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the addition to the finance bill of a provision exempting the capitalagricultural value of agricultural land from the increased rates of Estate duty and subjecting such land to Duty at theold rates.    The concession not to applyto any element in the value of agricul-tural land which may be due to suitabilityfor building, and not to operate so as toreduce the aggregate value of an estatefor the purpose of ascertaining the properrate of Duty.
EMPIRE CURRENCY.       6. The. Chancellor of&apos; the Exchequer read to hisBorrowing by      colleagues a letter he had received from thethe Dominions&apos;and Colonies.&apos;     Governor of the Bank of England in regard to theprobable cumulative effect of the numerous loanspreviousReferencet which had &quot;been placed-, or were about to be placed,Cabinet 8(2l), Con- on the London money market by the Dominions.    Thiselusion 4.)was bound to lead to an increase in the Bank Rate,which was in the interest neither of Great Britainnor of the Dominions,   unless some action was - takeneither to restrict the borrowing by the dominions or to divert them to the New York money market, or,alternatively, to ask them to place their loans partly in London and partly in New York.In order to meet the views of the Governor ofthe Bank, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had asked ,the/Secretary of State for the Colonies to forward to the Dominions a telegram (which Mr Churchill read to the Cabinet) with the objeot of warning them ofthe probable consequences of the placing of furtherissues and of requesting them to do their best to postpone borrowing for the present.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesexplained that he had thought it advisable to consult the Cabinet before sending the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s telegram.    The policy of the present government was based on Empire development * includingEmpire migration.    He was reluctant, without the express.sanction of the Cabinet, to take any actionwhich would tend to check this policy.    At presentthe expenditure of the Dominions in Great britain had a most beneficial influence in creating employmentin this country, and this was due to the fact that alarge proportion of the loans was spent here and never
left the country.   Mr Amery felt also that the illeffects of such loans on the international exchangesnight he surmounted.    In this connection he pointedout that in the case of the Colonies of East Africa,West Africa, and the Straits Settlements, the exchangehad been stabilised with the exchange of this country,so that borrowing on their account could take place without affecting the international exchange any morethan would a loan within Great Britain Itself.    Thequestion had been discussed by the Cabinet in the past,and at the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923, butstabilisation of exchanges with the Dominions had not then been possible.    Now, however, the situation was completely changed by the return of Great Britain tothe gold standard.In the course of the discussion it emerged thatthere were two problems involved(i) The effect of further borrowing bythe Dominions on the internationalexchanges and the Bank Rate:(ii) Whether there was enough creditavailable In this country to supplyall the needs for borrowing, both at home and abroad.The President of the Board of Trade stated that,at his monthly meeting with representatives of industry that morning, considerable apprehension had been expressed as to the probable effect of Dominionsborrowing on the Bank Rate.Attention was also called to the amount of the loans made by this country abroad during the last fewyears, which exceeded our economic capacity   .as represented by the balance of trade, includinginvisible exports.
There was general, agreement in an;f  vent thatit was necessary to warn the Dominions in regard tothe effect of further borrowing.The Cabinet agreed - (a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should send to the Dominionsa telegram on the lines proposed, theterms of which would be agreed withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer,warning them of the effect of furtherborrowing, and asking them to exercisecaution in regard to&quot;further issues:(b) That the Committee of Civil research should examine the question of our capacity to meet the demands for credit at home and abroad, havingparticular regard to the requirements .of Empire development and the mainten-ance of our export trade, and to make recommendations.-10-
7. The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that thequestion of the pay and conditions of the Police forces had he en under examination by a Committee under theChairmanship of Lord Lee of Fareham, and he was glad toreport that an agreement had been reached which was acceptable to the Police and the Local Authorities.These proposals vrould involve an addition, in a completeyear, of  280,000 to the pay of the Polios.    At therequest of the Home Secretary, the Cabinet agreed  That the proposals of the HomeSecretary in&quot; regard to the pay of the Police should be referredto a Committee to be composed of -The Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  *The Home Secretary -^hich should be empowered? in case ofagreement, to authorise the HomeSecretary to implement the agreement reached, but which, if Unable toreach agreements should bring thequestion back to the Cabinet.&quot;
safeguarding of INDUSTRIESLEGISLATION,Applicationfrom the Ironand. SteelIndustryx(previous reference:Cabinet 24(25) , Oon-clusion 6.)8. The President of the Board of Trade informed theCabinet that a request had been received from theIron and Steel industry for the application to that industry of the Safeguarding of Industries Act.    Theemployers and employed In this industry were agreed onthe subject, and had made out a very strong case forinquiry.The Cabinet agreed  That the question should be considered at the&apos;next Meeting of the Cabinet,and that in the meantime the Presidentof the Board of Trade should circulatefull information.it     o     o e2, Whitehall Gardens, s.w.1,June 10, 1925.
