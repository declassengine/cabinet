1. The Cabinet had before them the following documents&apos;in regard to the draft Treaty of Mutual -Guarantee:-A revised draft Treaty of mutual guarantee , incorporating the - amend-meanrts suggested by the Committee ofImperial Defence (Paper CP.-318 (25):A draft (liable to correction) of theMinutes and Conclusions of the 201stMeeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, held on the afternoon ofJuly 1st, at which this question hadbeen discussed (Paper CP.-322 (25)):A Memorandum by the Foreign Office onthe policy of the proposed Treaty of mutual Guarantee (Paper CP.-317 (25)):A letter, dated July 2, 1925, fromMr Austen Chamberlain to M. Briand,in regard to the Geneva Protocol andthe Pact, sent as the result of theprevious Meeting of the Cabinet(Paper CP.-324 (25)).The Cabinet were informed that tho Meeting ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence had been attendednot by all the Ministers invited, but by a representa-tive number, as well as by the Chiefs of Staffs of thethree Services, and that the Committee, after a close examination of the texts had agreed to recommend tothe Cabinet the adoption of the draft Treaty of mutual guarantee, subject to certain amendments which had been incorporated in the draft now before the Cabinet.Paragraph 8 of the draft Treaty had been re-draftedas the result of a consultation between the LordChancellor and Sir Cecil Hurst, the Legal Adviser tothe Foreign Office, on the recommendation of theCommittee.of Imperial Defence.Daring the Cabinet Meeting no criticism was offered in regard to the principles of the draft Treaty,and the discussion was confined to certain questions of
The question was raised as to whether Clause 7(4) was consistent with Clauses 1 to 3 of the draft.After consultation with Sir Cecil Hurst, the question was left for him to settle with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, subject to the approval of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Some discussion took place also in regard to clause 8, and it was pointed out that the question would be raised publicly as to whether a resort to war was or was not consistent with the Covenant of theLeague of Nations.    It was explained that,in any event,if the facts were in dispute, a British Governmentwould not be under an obligation to resort to war until it was satisfied as to the facts.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the draft Treaty of mutual guarantee contained in CP.-318 (25),subject to any amendment that might be approved by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs as the result of the consultation between the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster and Sir CecilHurst in regard to the consistency of clause 7 (4) with Clauses 1 to 3:(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should tele,eraph the termsof the draft Treaty of Mutual guarantee to the Dominions the same evening:(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to communi-cate the terms of the draft Treaty of mutual Guarantee, contained in CP.-318- (25) , to the French Government as repre-senting the views of the British Govern-,ment as to the form the proposed Pactshould take, but that he should wait until the following day before doing so,in order that&apos;the Dominions might firstreceive the text. .
2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Informed theCabinet that M. Pirelli, the Italian Financial Expert,was leaving London on the following day, and it hadbeen thought advisable, in order that the attitudeof the Treasury might be indicated correctly, to give him, before he left, an aide-memoire in regard to therecent conversations.   Mr Churchill then read to theCabinet the document reproduced in the Appendix tothese Conclusions.At the request of the Seoretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Chancellor of the Exchequer madea small amendment (shown in the Appendix)on the lastpage of the aide-memoire.The Cabinet, who were not asked to approve the precise terms of the aide-memoire , which, they were assured, was consistent with the general policy of theGovernment on the question of Inter-Allied Debts, took,note of it and approved it in principle.
11) 9 .3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents- in regard to the situation in MoroccoA draft (liable to correction) of theMinutes and Conclusions of the 201stMeeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, held on the afternoon ofJuly 1st, on the subject of the situa-tion in Morocco (Paper CP.-322 (25));Despatch from Mr Austen Chamberlainto Mr Grurney (Madrid) , No. 346 of June29th, 1925 (B&apos;,0. Paper No.W-6176/39/28):A despatch from -Mr Austen Chamberlain toLord Grewe (Paris) No2225 of June 29,1925 (P.O. Paper No.C.8766/4/62).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the Cabinet a full report of conversations he had held,subsequent to the meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, with the French and Spanish Ambassadors,particulars of which would be circulated at an earlydate to the Cabinet.   As regards the proposal for Britishco-operation in naval surveillance in Moroccan waters,he had, as the result of the .reconmiendations of-theCommittee of Imperial Defence, informed the Ambassadorsthat the British Government were ready, in accordancewith the Tangier Convention, to participate in navalsurveillance of contraband arms traffic irrtheterritorial waters of the Tangier Zone provided thatthey were satisfied as to the legalit:^ of such action under international law, but that they saw no reason toextend this action to the French and Spanish zones.The French Ambassador had informed him that the proposal was to extend surveillance to - a six-mile&apos; limit, as wellas to lines drawn on certain portions of the coast fromone cape to. another, so as to include waters outsidethe&apos;three-mile limit.    Mr Chamberlain had not encouraged the Ambassador to think that this proposal would be acceptable to the British Government.   As regards theproposal to send a British contingent to an inter-national f-orce, with the object of preserving the-4-
neutrality of the Tangier Zone, the French ambassador had ashed him to allow conversations to take place between military.experts of Great Britain, France and spain.    ThejlAmbassador had also intimated, that, in theabsence of British co-operation, it might be necessaryto send a Franco-Spanish force to protect the neutralIn the&apos;discussion which followed, it was recognised that we could not refuse to take our share in any action which might he indispensable for thepreservation of the neutrality of the Spanish zone,or in any conversations which might be necessary to concert arrangements to meet this contingency.whichmight arise, if at all, at short notice.   The importance,however, was emphasized of exercising great caution toavoid entanglement in the hostilities against Abd-el-JKrim and of keeping any military conversations on asinformal a footing as possible.The Cabinet agreed - (a) That the proposals for naval surveil-lance in Moroccan waters should be examined by the Admiralty, who should give their considered opinion thereonto the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should continue,to hold similar language to that whichhe had already used^as &quot;the result of the201st meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, in regard to our general interestin the preservation of neutrality.    Heshould not refuse British co-operation in,-an emergency, but should continue tothe inadvisability of sending&quot;an international force at the present justice.    He should strongly deprecateisolated action by France and Spain inthe neutral zone.   While not refusingthe proposal that British military expertsshould take part in military conversations with French and Spanish military expertswith a v iew toe oncert ing a r f an geme nt sto meet a possible future violation ofthe zone, he should make clear that
-the British Government would only nacquiesce in the landing of a forceif they were convinced that an attack was imminent.   He should endeavour-to confine the military conversations,if possible, to an interchange of views in London between officers of the GeneralStaff and French and Spanish MilitaryAttaches, or some corresponding arrangement(e) That, if circumstances should necessi-tato the despatch of an international force to the Tangier zone, the commandshould not be accorded to a French orSpanish officer, as this would tend to identify the force with one or other of the countries now engaged withAbd-el-Krim and might lead to undesirablecomplications.    It &quot;was essential thatany international force should be underthe command of a British officer in orderto demonstrate that the only object ofthe force was the preservation of..i     neutrality and to secure strict adherence to this r6Ie.    It was recognised thatthis might perhaps necessitate a slightpreponderance of the British element &quot;inany&quot; international force:(d) That the Secretary of State for war should give instructions to representa-tives of the General Staff taking part in conversations with French and SpanishOfficers that they are on no account to convey an impression that we consider it probable that an international force willbe required, or that the British Govern-ment are committed to its despatch:(e) That, as recommended by the Committee ofImperial Defence, the War Office shouldcontinue to prepare secret plans,including the normal enrolment ofSection ffAn Reserves, for the despatchof a force up to two Birlgades and ancillary units.
NEST MEETING 4.   After the Secretary had, under instructionsOP CABINET.from the Cabinet, consulted &quot;by telephone the Secretaryof State for India, who had been, unable to attend theMeeting owing to pressure of other urgent business,the Cabinet agreed that, In order to suit the convenience-ence of members, the meeting to be&apos; attended by theGovernor-General of India, which had been arranged forMonday, July 6th, should take place instead on tuesday, July 7th, at 11-30 a.m.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,July 3, 1925.-7
A P T E JS D I X.AIDE MEUOIKE.ITALIAN DEBT MffijMG.Monsieur Pirelli,  after explaining the proposals whichthe Italian Government were putting forward for the settlementof their War Debt to the United States of America, outlinedcertain proposals for the settlement of the War Debt to GreatBritain.Under these proposals, two classes of payment were provided,for (a) a fixed obligation, and  (b) a variable obligation,dependent on the yield of the Dawes Annuities.      But the fixedobligation was to serve to redeem the Italian gold deposit(gold being returned as and when any payment was made underthis head) so that there would not be any net benefit to theBritish Government at least for many years which could be setoff against our current liabilities to the United States.     Onthe other hand, the variable obligation was to be represented by an unspecified percentage of any reparation receipts whichItaly might receive over and beyond a substantial minimum whichhas not yet been reached and which may very likely never be exceeded,These proposals cannot serve as a basis of negotiation.They would represent the virtual cancellation of the wholeItalian debt, and would yield substantially less in cash thanthe offer which the Italian Government is disposed to make tothe United States.Monsieur Pirelli defended his proposals by reference tocertain informal discussions which took place in 1923;    but these discussions were not,  in fact, ever endorsed by the BritishGovernment and were dependent on the execution of the plan
proposed .by Mr. Bonar law in all its details.    In particular,that plan provided for a system o  distribution between theAllied Governments of the German obligations such as would secure to Great Britain a share of German payments sufficientto cover the British debt to America.      That plan was nevercarried through, and it should clearly be understood that anypourparlers based upon it must be revised in the light of present circumstances and particulrtrly in the light of the assets which Great Britain may now expect to recover&apos;fromGermany under the Dawes Plan.Tho principal points of the present situation are :-(1) Great Britain has already paid to the United states under the Funding Agreement some . 65 millions more than hertotal reparation receipts and this deficiency is being increased by some  25 millions per annum.      Great Britainmust call upon the Powers indebted to her to cover the pastdeficiency as well as the future.(2) The amount so to be recovered must be distributed between the several debtor Powers according to their capacityof payment.    For this purpose, the economic position ofeach debtor Power must be considered separately.(3) The modality of payment should be such as to ensure a substantial fixed payment by each debtor State,  irrespective of the yield of reparations..      In addition, there might be a secondary payment contingent on the yield of reparations, but any such payment would have to be a percentage of the grossreparations receipts of the debtor Power.(4) Payments should commence forthwith though the scalti ofpayments might be graduated for a short period of years beforethe full normal annuity is brought into force.
At the request , of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs this was amended to read &quot;do not propose totake any exception&quot;.These arc tho principled which should be embodied inany offer which the British Government could consider.Two further points require, however,  to be made clear.Tho first relates to the relative position of the UnitedStates and British debts.     T&apos;hilo His Majesty1 s Governmentxhave no objection X   to the United States granting the Powersindebted to hor terms more liberal than those accorded in theBritish Funding Agreement - this being a question of equityfor the creditor Power - they have the strongest objection toany differentiation by the debtor States between theirrespective debts and thoy must therefore insist that any payments ma.de to the United States of America by a Powerindebted also to.them must be accompanied simultaneously by atleast proportionate payments to this country.      On this con-dition alone could His Majesty!s Government maintain tho very favourable terms of the Balfour Note.Tho second point relates to the Italian gold deposit.This deposit is returnable only when the full amount of theItalian debt to this country is repaid:    and if that debt isto be substantially reduced, the gold deposit imrst, in sub-stance, be set off against any such reduction.     This does not preclude an arrangement being made under which the ItalianGovernment could, at its  option, redeem this gold; butpayments under such an arrangement would have to be additional to and not  included in the payments in respect of the net war debt envisaged above.      Similarly, if interest were to be al-lowed on this gold,.the payments to be made by Italy wouldrequire to be pro tanto increased.
