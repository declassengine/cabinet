1.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePostmaster-General (Paper C.P.-304 (25)) in which he urged that capital expenditure for this year and nextmay be authorised to the extent of  12,000,000 and 13,000,000 respectively; - together with a Note bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-326 (25))covering a Treasury Memorandum pointing out the relation of telephone construction to the many items of capital expenditure which the State has to finance,and offering that the State should find for telephoneconstruction in x-he next three years a maximum sum of 32,000,000, to be divided, roughly, equally betweenthe three years.In the course of the discussion, emphasis was laid on the large expenditure which was being: incurredat the present time on works of a non-remunerativecharacter in relief of unemployment, and it was feltthat, before rejecting proposals for an expenditure which would not only give employment but would also beproductive and provide for interest, depreciationand amortization, it would be desirable to review the general question of the application of State credit to various projects, in order to establish the relative importance of expenditure on telephones in the generalsuchscheme of/expenditure.While emphasizing the importance of exercisingvigilance in regard to the thrifty disposition of ourlimited credit resources, more particularly in&apos;view ofthe conversion operations contemplated ih the nearfuture, the Chancellor of. the Exchequer undertook togive further consideration to the question from theabove point of view.The question was adjourned for a week.-1-
*) 9 r2. The Cabinet had before them a draft of a note from the Seoretary of State for Foreign Affairs to theFrench and Spanish Ambassadors, based to a considerable extent on the previous discussions at the Cabinet on :this subject (Paper CP. -332 (25)).The Secretary of State informed his colleagues that since he load prepared the above draft he hadreceived a visit from the French Ambassador.    Up to thetime of this visits the French Ambassador1 s support tothe Spanish proposals had been partial and somewhathesitating.    On this occasion- however., he had supported the Spanish demands with insistence.    The Secretary ofState then read an aide-memoire which he had receivedfrom the French Ambassador, stating that Marshal Lyauteywas pressing for the despatch of troops to the TangierZone;   that the French agreed; that the Spanish Governmentwould not continue the negotiations until this natterhad been settled;   asking for the immediate, despatch ofoontingents from the three Powers;    suggesting that theConsuls-General at Tangier should discuss the matter with the assistance of Military Attachesj   that the commanders of the military detachments, in consultationwith the Mendoub, should concert measures for securingthe. neutrality of the Zone;   proposing that the Spanishforce should be maintained near the town of Tangier, andthe French and British forces on the frontier, in orderto avoid an incident;   that the handing over of nativesin the neutral zone to the Spaniards should only takeplace in the case of particular individuals;   and urging that the tribesmen should be disarmed.    At one time theFrench Ambassador had used language which Mr ChamberlainGovernmenthad interpreted to imply that the French/had decided,in conjunction with the Spanish Government-, to send
troops to the neutral zone even If the British Govern-ment was unwilling to co-operate,    fe-^ew^ed^the-^^^^^^m^^er&quot;, the Ambassador, had IqgggfrgSy explainedthat the French a&amp;aald-aot*a;jrtife -uo.    On being informedthat the Foreign Secretary was preparing a despatch,the French Ambassador had asked that, before it was sent, the Foreign Secretary would at least reportthis conversation to the Cabinet.    Mr Chamberlainwas not disposed, however, to recommend any change inthe policy already approved by the Cabinet.In the subsequent discussion, no dispositionwas shown to depart from, the previous decisions ofthe Cabinet on this subject.The question of the importance to the BritishEmpire of - the neutrality of the Spanish Zone was&apos; again,raised.    The Secretary explained that, owing to thelarge number of documents in which the material of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on this subject was.contained, he had found it necessary to prepare asummary, which he hoped to complete that day.The Cabinet agreed  To approve&apos;the draft despatch containedin CP.-332 (25), subject to an amendment;in paragraph 10, which the foreign secretary proposed to introduce, with aview to making- clear that the military conversations were not to be of a veryformal character.
90 7IjSSlA. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsfcish Policy    brought before the Cabinet the question of our generalOV-&apos;?&apos;I&apos;hS &apos; ,policy towards Soviet Russia.    He gave evidence fromivious several sources to show that what most disconcertedfere nee:ginst 20 the Soviet Government was an attitude of   indifferenceI), Con-ision 3.-) to them.    Since the Bolshevist system depended inI essence on its extension to other countries, whatmost disturbed them was to find themselves treated in international relations almost as though they did not exist.    The more they were denounced the greater was their satisfaction, as shown by their published state-ments.    In these cireumstatnoes he felt that theproper course was to keep a watchful eye on theirproceedings, to reserve liberty to take any action-that might be deemed necessary when sufficient evidenceof their misdeeds was forthcoming;    to keep the formalrelations as distant as possible;   but, in the meantime.,not to yield to the demand in some quarters for anearl:/ breaking off of relations.    He appealed to hisoolleagues to bear this in mind in their public speeches.    This was important not only from the pointof&apos; view of the effect on the Soviet Government them-selves , but in order to avoid action.which mightassist the extremists in this country at the expense&apos;    of the moderate elements in the Opposition Partieswhich were opposed to Bolshevism.&apos; While it was&apos; pointed out that it was difficult in public speechesto avoid references/to the Soviet Government, andmore particularly to the failure of their economic system in their own country, the policy of the foreign secretary was approved.
IaRLIAMS nt akyIandidatureIp STATEServants.(previous reference:Cabinet 19[24), Coh-conclusion  1.)4.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by&apos; theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-321 (25))covering a Treasury Memorandum and the Report of a treasury Committee on the Parliamentary Candidatureof Crown Servants (Cud.2408).The Cabinet endorsed without qualification the findings of the Committee on the Parliamentary Candida-ture of Crown Servants, and approved the conclusionsof the Report (Crrd.2408) so far as the Committee were unanimous.
i229Ui^EMPLOYMENT. 5. The Cabinet had before them a Report by theUnemployment Committee, circulated shortly before the(Previous&apos;Reference: Meeting, drawing attention to two urgent questions on cabinet 29 .(25)j Con- which early decisions are required, namely, the termselusion 1.)of grant by the Unemployment Grants Committee, anddrainage schemes for the relief of unemployment (paper cp.-330 (25)).In view of the short time which had been avail-able for the study of the Report, the Cabinet agreedto adjourn its consideration for a week.-6-
6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regardto an Anti-Alcoholic Congress to be held at Geneva in September (Paper CP.-320 (25)), in which it was stated that all the Departments concerned (Home office colonial Office, Board of Trade, Ministry of Health)had concurred in a proposal of the Foreign office that His Majesty&apos;s Government should reply to the invitation of the International Bureau againstAlcoholism that, not being a member of the Bureau,they would not be represented at the approachingConference, and that if, as   a   result of this refusalan invitation were received from the Swiss Government,then the same procedure should be adopted as in previous years, and a Secretary of the Legation at berne should be attached as. an observer, with instruc-tions to express no opinion on the natters debated,and, in particular, to refrain from committing HisMajesty&apos;s Government on any of the controversialquestions which would apparently be raised at theConference.The Cabinet approved the proposals,as setforth above, already concurred in by the Departmentsconcerned.
Widows .iJBPHANS&apos;m olDm oon-&apos;e1but0byensionsilLL.    -previous[ayinet 3225), Con-liision 7. )7. The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theSecretary of State for War and the Minister of health on the position of Navy. Army and Air Force widowsunder the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and.Old Age contributory pensions Bill (Papers CP.-328 (25) and CP.-331 (25)).The Cabinet were informed that the committee set up on the last occasion when this question had beendiscussed, had not been able to meet, owing to the pressure on the time of the Ministers concerned, butthat various conversations had taken place.The Cabinet were also informed that the service ministers would be prepared to accept the suggestion of the Minister of Health (CP.-331 (25)) that provision should be made for the widows and children of sailors,&apos;. soldiers and airmen whose death is attributable to naval,military or air service, on lines similar to that provided in the proposed amendment of the Bill in thecase of widows and children of persons for whom provision is made by the &quot;Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts.    It was recognised, however, that this proposal could not beadopted if it was found that it involved heavy expendi-ture on Ministry of Pensions cases.    On the understabd-ing that such heavy expenditure on Ministry of Pensionscases could not be incurred, the Cabinet agreed  That the First Commissioner of works should confer with the Ministers oon-cerned, including the Minister ofPensions, and should give a decision.

The Cabinet took note of a decision given bythe Prime Minister that the increased State contri-bution under the Unemployment Insurance Bill shoulddate from April 5th, 1926, instead of from January 4th,1926, as provided for in the draft Bill (Paper CP. -323 (25)).
