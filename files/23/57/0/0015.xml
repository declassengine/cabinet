1.  The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (paper.P.-94 (28)) in regard to the proposals of theEastern Telegraph and Marconi Companies for a merger, as a condition of which they have askedfor the transfer of the Post Office Beam Service.In this Note Mr Amery urged that no public announcement should be made during the progressof theGonference which would ,prejudge its conclusions, and that any Question in the Houseof Commons should be answered by refusing to makea statement in advance of a Report by the ImperialConference.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs informed   the Cabinet that his proposal was in accordance with the attitude adopted bythe Canadian Government in their Parliament.Since&apos; writing his Memorandum Mr Amery had receivedletters from the Australian High Commissioner andfrom Sir Campbell Stewart, the Canadian repre-sentative on the Imperial Wireless Conference,deprecating any announcement of the british governments policy until after the Conference.The Secretary of State for Scotland, as chairman of the Imperial Wireless Conference,made statements regarding the progress of theConference.After some further discussion, the cabinet agreed  (a) That the following Answer shouldbe given to Questions to be askedin the House of Commons on the morrow:-VX will answer Questions(four) together,,   His Majesty&quot; sGovernment and the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference
had no previous knowledgeof the details of and haveno responsibility for any financial arrangements forthe merger of the EasternTelegraph and Marconi Com-panies.   As regards thegeneral question, I can make no statement in advance of reports from the ImperialConference which only onMonday received a proposal from the two Companies;   but,since Honourable Members havespecifically enquired as tothe attitude of His Majesty&apos;s^^^VwJtU^,      Government I think it rightto say that the Government,while it Is prepared to join in discussing measures for a working arrangement, is not committed even in principle and reserves freedom of actionin regard to any proposals for transfer of the operation andcontrol of the Imperial wireless services at present administered by His Majesty*s Government&quot;.(b) That, Insomuch as the four Ques-tions down for Thursday, March 22ndhad already been postponed, itwould not be convenient, from a parliamentary point of view, tomake the announcement the same afternoon in reply to a private notice Question.
CHINA,Lg Nankingincidentlesot 1st ionsPreviousReference:Lbinet 8(28), Con-conclusion 2. )2.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (paper c.P.-84  (28)) covering a telegram despatched toSir Miles Lampson.      In his covering note sir austen Chamberlain had explained that he felt it necessary to reply at once to a telegram fromthe British Minister at Peking lest Sir miles lampson should become committed to what he held to be a humiliatinp&quot; and inadmissible surrender,  andhad beffed that if any of his colleagues shoulddissent they should ask the Prime Minister tocall the Cabinet together at once.      The cabinet also had before them a Note by the Secretary ofState  (Paper CP.-91 (28)) covering a memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office explaining thepresent position with regard to the Nankingnegotiations, attaching the recent telegramsreceived from Sir Miles Lampson,  together witha draft reply.      The substance of the proposalcontained In the Foreign Office Memorandum wasthat nothing in recent developments has occurred to  alter o\iv fundamental objections to the termsof the proposed exchange of Notes insofar as theyconcern the humiliating reference to our firing at nanking and to the wholly extraneous matter of treaty revision, and that in spite of Sir MilesLarnpson&apos;s urgent appeal he could not be authorisedto sign them:    nevertheless,  that the Secretaryof State was prepared to regard the spontaneousissue of the two mandates as an indication of theNanking Government&apos;s desire to accept their shareof responsibility for the incident and to prevent such incidents in future,  and that he was also
ready to recognise that the preparations now-being made for Sir Miles Lampeon&apos;s reception and Mr Hewlett&apos;s return to Nanking are something in the nature of a public apology and gestureifof goodwill;   henceythe Nanking Government wouldconfirm to Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s satisfactiontheir initial offer of  30,000 and agree to drop the whole question of any exchange of draftNotes, Sir Miles Lampson will be authorised toproceed to Nanking and install Mr Hewlett there,leaving him to carry on any subsequent negotia-tions in regard to the question of reparation.The Note also provided that In the event of theJapanese and United States Governments securingmore favourable terms in any respect. HisMajesty&apos;s Government would reserve their rightto similar treatment.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had received nocomment from any of his colleagues in regardto CP.-84 (28)0   He drew particular attentionto the provision in the draft telegram that, inthe event of the Japanese and United states government securing more favourable terms, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would reserve their rightto demand similar treatment.The Cabinet approved the draft telegram attached to Paper C.P.-91 (28), the policy containedin which is summarised above.
INTER-imperial relations.The Situationin the EventOf a Ruptureof DiplomaticRelationsbetween a dominion anda foreign country.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(27).  Con-clusion 6.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to a Memorandum(Paper CeP.-87 (28)) which he recently circulated on the subject of the situation that would be created by the rupture of diplomatic relationsbetween a Dominion and a foreign country.   TheMemorandum had been prompted by a recant incidentwhich led to a request by the Canadian Governmentfor the recall of the Mexican Consul-General inToronto.     The Secretary of State suggested thatit might be advisable to address a despatch tothe Governments of the Dominions on the subject,impressing on them the need for the earliestpossible Intimation of any friction with aforeign nation.In the course of the discussion It wassuggested that the matter was one which might perhaps be postponed until the next ImperialConference, or, alternatively, that it was one more suitable for informal communication than for a formal despatch to the Dominions.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs undertook to circulate indue course a Memorandum expressinghis views on C.P.-87 (.28) and raisingany similar questions, such as theposition of the Dominions in theevent of Great Britain being engagedin a war, with a view to further discussion at the Cabinet.
SEDUCTION0D LIMIT A-TION of armaments .(previous previous reference:Cabinet 14(28), Con-elusion 3(b) .)MESSAGE TOLORDOUSHENDUN -4.  The Cabinet had before them (i) the record of a conversation between the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and M. Briand, and of a sub-sequent conversation between the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (Paper C.P.-81 (28)),and (ii) the record of another part of the con-versa tion relating to Air Disarmament (paper c.P.-82 (28)).The Cabinet took note of the above Memo-randa.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to a speechmade at Geneva on the previous day by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on thesubject of the proposals of the Russian SovietGovernment for complete disarmament, in which,after his foreign colleagues had confined theirremarks to generalities, Lord Cushendun hadexposed the said proposals to a searchingcriticism, thus repeating the experience (socommon at Geneva) that It was left to the british representatives to utter what most of those present felt.The Cabinet authorised theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs to send to the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster a letterof congratulation and support.
POOR LAWRELIEF.disqualification-cation for voting atGuardians *Elections *f PreviousReS$g once:Cabinet 14(23), Con-olmslon 7,)5. Ttie Cabinet had before themby the Minister of Health. (Paper (28))on the sub^eot of the propriety of restoring the Boor Relief disqualification for voting atthe eleotioa of Gnarjjianfl only,   At the conclusions^enof this reasoned Memorandum thp Minister ofHgH&amp;lth submitted tijat a meagre of disfranchise-men t for paupers. Insofar as Guardians&apos; Eleetiensare oonoerned and with due provision for th*protection of eases of such real misfortune asdisability by mental or physical sickness was urgently required.The Minister of Health made a statement insupport of his proposals.In the course of the discussion it waspointed out that if the   Bill could not be passed in the present Session it would be neces-sary to re-consider, in the light of other legislation, such as the Chancellor of theExchequer^ rating plan and Poor Law Reform,the question of its introduction in a futureSession.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve in principle the Intro-duction of a Bill restoring the poor Law disqualification for voting at the election of guardians only:(b) That the Prime Minister should discuss with the Chief Whip thepossibility of introducing andpassing such a Bill in the present session:(c) That the Home Secretary should beIn charge of the Bill.
THE IRISHFREE STATE.compensation claims tinderArticle 10 ofthe Articlesof Agreementof 1921.(previous reference:Cabinet 13(28), Oon-clusion 7.)6. The Cabinet had before then; the following documents on the subject of Compensation claims under Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement,1921:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofStats for Dominion Affairs (paper c.P.--88 (28)) covering an opinion by the Law Officers of-the crown to the effect that legislation inthis country is necessary in orderto carry out the undertaking inparagraph 2 of the despatch to theIrish Free State of January SO,1928 (attached to Paper C.P.-42 (28))and that they are of opinion thatthe best form of legislation wouldbe by a Statute declaratory of themeaning of the Government of ireland act, 1920.    In his Memorandum theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs urged that , so far as thesituation in the Irish Free state is concerned,, it will be settinga dangerous precedent to departfrom the principle that the Treatycannot be modified except by formal agreement between the two Govern-ments, followed by confirmatorylegislation by the two Parliaments.He considered it desirable at once to proceed to consult with theIrish Free State Government as tothe details of legislation in both countries:A Memorandum by the Treasury, cir-culated by direction of the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-93 (28)) covering a &quot;&quot;letter from lord craigavon expressing the opinion that northern Ireland should not be brought within the ambit of any legislation which the Privy Council may think itdesirable to introduce.   In theTreasury Memorandum it was suggestedthat if, as the Law Officers propose,legislation la introduced declaratoryof the intention of the Act of 1920,it must extend to Northern Ireland.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (&amp;) That, the Attorney-General should further study the form of the pro-posed legislation:(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should invite theIrish Free State Government to sendone of their Legal Officers toconfer with the Legal. Officersof his Department.
THE Pf^DCOUNCIL.Power toobtain In-f ormatlon,(previous reference:Cabinet 4(26), Con-clusion 8.)The tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence)Act, 1921,7.  The President of the Board of Trade,informed&quot;the Cabinet that the Pood Council, while purposelyrefraining from passing any resolution on thesubject, had notified him privately of the diffi-cultles they had encountered in obtaining theinformation essential for * * carrying out their task of creating an instructed public opinion on food questions.   The fact that the Pood council had no powers was well known by traders, and therewas an increasing unwillingness on their part tosupply information asked for.   The work of theCouncil had consequently become progressively more difficult, and the matter had been broughtto a head by correspondence with the London RetailTraders&apos; Association.   The Council felt now thatthey could not effectively pursue further the taskallotted to them unless they could legally compel the production of such Information as they require.The President of the Board of Trade recalled thatthe Prime Minister had on several occasionsannounced that if the Government were convinced the work of the Pood Council suffered by theabsence of such powers they would not hesitate togo to Parliament to ask for them.    The Attorney-General had informed him that legislation couldbe avoided by appointing the Pood Council as a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)Act, 1921.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the President of the Board of &apos;Trade should be authorised to informthe Chairman of the Pood council that the Cabinet were prepared, ifnecessary, to give the Council allthe support required to enable themto obtain essential information, butthat the Cabinet would like the
Council in the fUrsir-dnHtanc ato give warning of the Govern-mentTs intention to those whowere withholding information, inthe hope that this might produce the desired result;That if it became necessary to implement the Governmentcs promise to give support, this should bedone under the provisions of the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)Act   1921, and that the Presidentof the Board of Trade should discuss with the Chairman of thePood Council exactly what powers would be required with a view tothe drafting of the necessaryResolution to be passed inaccordance with Section 1 ofthe Act by both Rouses of Parliament.10-
BETTING.The Totalisator,(previous oneReference:Cabinet 14(88), Con-elusion 6.)8. In view of the passing of the Second reading of the Racecourse Betting Bill, the Cabinet agreed(a) That a Cabinet Committee,&apos;com-posed as follows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Howe Secretary,The Secretary of State for India,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,The &quot;Attorney-General,The Lord Advocate, -should meet to consider whether some Statutory authority might be set up by the Bill toundertake the functions at presentallotted therein to the JockeyClub and the National Hunt Committee:That until the form the Bill was likely to assume aftex* the committee stage was known there could be noquestion of deciding the extent ofthe Parliamentary facilities to begiven to it.(b)
iITHE RUBBERINDUSTRYBill.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 57(?.7), Con-elusion 16.)9. The Cabinet were informed that the objectOf the Rubber Industry Bill, to be introduced onFriday, March 30th, 1928, by a Private Member(Mr, Waddington), was to raise a levy for thepurposes of rubber research.   The Bill was supported by a large proportion of the firms and of the capital engaged in the industry,although it was actively opposed by a small minority.   The purpose of the Bill was very similar to that of the Cotton Levy Act, whichwould shortly be coming up for renewal in theform of a Private Bill.    It was very important that the Government should support the latter,and for this reason, as well as on merits,it was desirable that they should support the rubber Industry Bill.The Cabinet authorised thePresident of the Board ofTrade to express approval ofthe Bill during the Debate onthe Second Reading in the Houseof Commons, but to leave theBill to a free vote of the House.
s\ r\6ii3THE BETTING 10. The Cabinet authorised the Secretary of(JUVENILEMESSENGERS) State for Scotland to state that the Betting(SCOTLAND)BILL. (Juvenile Messengers) (Scotland) Bill, to beintroduced by a Private Member (Sir W,Alexander)on Friday, March SO, 1928, was viewed with favoirby the Government.
23S;.safeguarding of INDUSTRIES11.   The President of the Board of Trade was(previous reference:Cabinet 42(27), Con-conclusion 5.)authorised to make the following statement ofpolicy in a forthcoming Debate in the House ofCommons on the subject of the Safeguarding ofIndustries:-I oannot of course agree thatSafeguarding is the only politicalmeans of accelerating the advent of prosperity, because it must berecognised that there are other causes than foreign competition which depress trade.   For example,it is universally recognised howserious is the burden of local rates, particularly on the heavy industries;    and as has been statedin the King&apos;s Speech this questionis engaging the anxious attentionof the Government.The Government have already announcedthat they do not propose to alter thegeneral procedure laid down in theWhite Paper in the present Parliament.Obviously, however, they will take into careful consideration theexperience gained under that pro-cedure in order to determine whatmethod of procedure may be most convenient in the future for giving effect to the policy of safeguardingwhich has proved so beneficial.So far as the particular case of iron and steel is concerned duringthe present Parliament, I can addnothing to the statement of thePrime Minister in answer to aQuestion on the 21st December, 1925,the essence of which is contained inthe following extract:-nThe evidence revealed a serious situation.   The pressure of foreigncompetition, aided by long hours,low wages and depreciated currencies,is being severely felt by our manu-facturers, .and had His majesty&apos;s government been able to deal withthe iron and steel industries in isolation we might have regarded the case for inquiry as complete.It became clear, however, in thecourse of our investigations, thatthe safeguarding of a basicindustry of this magnitude wouldhave repercussions of a far widercharacter which might be held tobe in conflict with our declaration in regard to a general tariff.In all the circumstances of thepresent time we have come to theconclusion that the applicationcannot be granted&quot;.
THE CROWNfSPREROGATIVEDJ the cession OP[TERRITORY.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 14(28), Con-elusion 10.)12. T5ie Cabinet took note of a copy of a lettersent by the Attorney-General to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper C.P.-8S (28)) onthe subject of the Crown&apos;s Prerogative in the cession of Territory, containing the followingOpinion dated 19th March, 1925:-wln our opinion it is constitution-ally within the Prerogative of theCrown to cede British, territory notforming part of a self-governingDominion.   But we regard it asundesirable that such a Preroga-tive right should be exercisedwithout the concurrence of Par-liament and we should advise thatany Treaty or Agreement containingsuch a provision should be submittedto Parliament for ratification&quot;.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 21, 1928o
