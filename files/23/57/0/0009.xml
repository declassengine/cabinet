NAVAL ECONOMIES.       5. In connection with the discussion on anti-aircraft       Naval Economies the First Lord of the AdmiraltyArtillery .drew attention to the reductions in naval expendi-[( Pr --vi previous reference: ture effected during the last few years.    in cabinet 6(88), Con- particular he called attention to a Memorandumelusion 5.)(Paper C.P.-360 (25))  of July 20, 1925, in whichthe Chancellor o^ the Exchequer   had contemplated6c,-,for 1928-29 a naval expenditure of  CO,627,701,compared with  57,600,000 now proposed by theAdmiralty.  7L O^J^^ ^ ^L ^ /&apos;Attention was drawn in particular to an item in the Admiralty Estimates for expenditureon an anti-aircraft weapon which,  it was stated,had not yet been tested in concert with the AirMinistry, and the suggestion was made that,before serious expenditure is incurred, the merits of this weapon should be discussed by theCommittee of Imperial Defence.The Prime Minister asked his colleaguesat the head of the Departments of the FightingServices to make inquiries in order to ensurethat the activities of their respective Depart-mants in the matter o&quot;5&quot; anti-aircraft artilleryare fully co-ordinated.
6. In view of the large economies already made on the Air Estimates, the Secretary ofState for Air found it impossible to give afavourable reply to th?; further appeal made tohim by the Chancellor of the Exchequer forstill   greater savings, and Mr Churchill felthe could not press this item any further.
OVERSEAS 7.    In conneotion with the discussion on theSETT LEMEMT .practicability of effecting some saving on the(Previous Vote for Empire Settlement, the Secretary ofRef reference e:Cabinet 53 State for Dominion Affairs laid strong emphasis(26),  Con-elusion 20.) on the fact that expenditure on this servicewithin a maximum is not exclusively under ourown control, as we are bound by agreements to payour share of migration schemes put forward by governments of the Dominions up to an annualmaximum of  3,000,000, provided we are satisfiedthat the schemes are sound and practicable.   we also had special agreements with theAustralian Government.   Recognising the urgentneeds of the financial situation, however,Mr Amery agreed to surrender  100,000 on theunderstanding that it was in the nature of a&quot;shadow cut&quot;, and that,if this sum should berequired later in order to implement our agree-ments, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider a Supplementary Estimate favourably.
IMPERIAL 8. Having regard, to the Imperial and senti-WAR graves commission. mental considerations involved, the Cabinet feltthat the proposed postponement of the increased(previous reference? provision for the Endowment Fund should be dropped.Cabinet 14(26), Con-elusion 1.)-8-
1 9 1I O iEMPIRE 9. in connection with the discussion en theMARKETINGBOARD. possibility of effecting economies on the vote for the Empire Marketing Board, the Secretary(previous reference: of State for Dominion Affairs laid stress on cabinet 42(27) Con- the great importance, from the point of view of elusion 6e)Imperial relations, of our honouring our engage-r ints to the Dominions to their full extent.In this connection attention was drawn tothe following passage In the Report (Paper C.P.-S7 (.2B)) of the Secretary of State on his racer:;visit to Australia:-*Ae instructed by the Cabinet,  I putbefor- Mr Bruce the inconveniencethat the Chancellor of the exchequer would be e-posed to if, in a year of exceptional financial difficulty, hewas obliged to put into suspenseaccount  600,000 of Empire MarketingBoard money which would not be needed for at least another two years.   MrBruce, like General Hertzog, appre-ciated the force of my arguments,  and expressed the view that,  as long asthe money was eventually available if required for the development ofthe work, he would not regard it asin any way a breach of our pledgeIf the present surplus were putback into the general pool of theyear&apos;s finances&quot;.Mr amery accepted a cut of  500,000, on theexplicit understanding:-(a) That the balance of this yearfs sumof  1,000,000 will be availablewhenever, in the opinion of theChairman of the Empire MarketingBoard (himself a member of theCabinet) the money is required forthe work of the Board, whether asa supplement to the Estimates of1928-9 or by an increase of themoney voted in subsequent Estimates:(b) That this iten in the Estimates mustbe marked as &quot;On account of the 1,000,000&quot;, and it must be made clear on the face of the estimates that the balance is available whenwanted.(See.....also,below.

In vi&apos;:&apos;1&quot; of the agreement of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to a exit of 500,000 in the Vote for the Empire MarketingBoard,, subject to certain understandings recordedabove in Conclusion 9,  the Cabinet agreed toMr AmeryTs strong representations againstexercising further pressure on the dominions to allow the British Government contribution of  25,000 toward the cost of advertising theBritish Industries Pair    to be borne by theEmpire Mark ting Board.   Mr Amery, however, was asked to communicate personally to Mr Bruce,thePrime Minister of the Commonwealth, by personal letter or by such channel as he might think best,the strong feeling of the Cabinet that it was notprudent,  even in the interest of Australia, totake too narrow a vIaw of the directions in which expenditure by the Empire Marketing Board was justified, since it was desirable not to renderthis expenditure unpopular to British taxpayers,on whom exclusively the burden falls.
