RUSSIA. 1. The Home Secretary made to the Cabinet a(Previous secret statement in regard to certain SovietReference:Cabinet 61 activities in this country.(27),  Con-elusion 1.) The Cabinet suggested that theHome Secretary should confer withthe Attorney-G-en&quot; ral    after thelatter had had time to considerthe matter in its legal aspects,in regard to the action    (if any)to be taken.-1-
10 6THE BASELTRADINGCOMPANY.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 8(28), Con-clusion 6.)2.     The Cabinet bad some further discussion in regard to the difficulties arising out of the affairs of the Basel Trading Company.The Secretary of State for the Colonieswarned his colleagues that the previous decisionof the Cabinet was not likely to solve the problemIEven though the Government of the Gold CoastColony might dispossess the Commonwealth Trustof their property in the Colony, there remainedtheir property In India, in regard to which no decision had been taken.   Moreover, the Trust wasa British Company registered in London, with pro-perty both in the Gold Coast and in India, and could probably only be dealt with by action inLondon.     The Company had been formed in good faith to take over these properties;    after aseries of lean years its prospects and theprospects of the employees, who had served theCompany in these difficult years, were improved,and all this made if difficult to carry out thepolicy proposed.    In these circumstances there appeared to be advantages in a Select committee with Terms of Reference as proposed in Paper C.P.-15 (28), in order to obtain the support of theirReport in dealing with the two parties.On the oth?r hand it was suggested thatthe same Governments as had enabled the company to take possession of its property could dispossessit.The proposal in Paper C.P.-15 (28) did not commend Itself, on the ground that Select Commit-tees were rather prone to recommend that theGovernment should pay heavy compensation.    TheBritish case ?/ould&apos; be irretrievably compromisedby any such recommendation if the matter should
be brought before the Hague Court of InternationalJus tic e.A good deal of support was given to theprevious decision of the Cabinet.    Insomuch as india was concerned it was felt to be impossibleto take any new decision in the absence of theSecretary of State for India,The Lord Privy Seal undertook to explain privately to LordTeirplstown that the Cabinet had at some length discussed thesubject, which was one ofconsiderable difficulty;    thatunfortunately,  owing to a publicengagement out of London,  theSecretary of State for india had not been present and ithad not been possible to con-si der the Indian aspects of thematter;    and to ask Lord^empletown if,  in these circum-stances, he would be willingto postpone his Question for aweek.    Lord Salisbury warned the Cabinet that,  if LordTemple town should refuse to postpone his Question, he wouldhave to bring it up at theMeeting of the Cabinet on thefollowing day.
140 j3.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Feme Secretary (Paper C.P.-3 (28)) covering!the draft of the Representation of the People(Equal Franchise) Bill.The discussion was focussed mainly on thequestion of Poor Relief disqualification, whether for thQ Parliamentary or Local G-overnment fran-franchise,  or for both.    The attention of theCabinetin London constituencieswas invited to the very strong feeling/in favouror such disqualification, owing to the flagrantabuse of the existing Poor Relief In certain partsof the Metropolis.    It was pointed out that vested interests (small shops,  etc.) were steadily growingup round those who had become dependent on relief on an extravagant scale.    This evil might be checked now by Poor Relief disqualification,but unless it was dealt with soon the. problem would become very formidable with the growth ofvested interests.The Cabinet, however, felt that the following reasons told overwhelmingly against pauper disqual-ification for the Parliamentary franchise(i) There are at present all over thecountry large numbers of bona fideworkmen who are out of employmentthrough no fault of their own,  todisfranchise whom would be very unfair.(ii) Many of the unemployed are ex-Servicemen.    To disfranchise these becausethey had been driven to accept PoorRelief.at a time when numbers of youngwomen     are  . being, enfranchisedwould be indefensible, more especially as. if ever we should again becomeembroiled in s%war, we should probably have to adopt some form of compulsory military service for men.In regard to Local Government it was pointedout that the franchise t?ould be divided under twoheade^ namely,, election- of Guardians *and electionREFRESENTA-TION OF THEPEOPLE (EQUALFRANCHISE)  BILL.(previous reference e:Cabinet 8(28), Con-clusion 4.)
of municipal authorities.   The fora^y turned on one issue, namely, what public relief was advls-able.   The great defect or the present franchisewas that the people who received relief were entitled to vote for the Guardians who administerit.    It would be possible to eliminate the evilsof the existing system by limiting pauperdisqualification to the election of Guardiansonly.^ha Cabinet felt that this proposaldeserved exploration, but that, if the plan were adopted, it would be advisable not to include itin a general Franchise Bill but in a separate Billto be introduced at about the same time.Reference was made in the discussion tohardship which had teen occasioned in certainCounties In Scotland owing to the law that theGeneral Election must be held on one day.    Owingto the difficulty in collecting the polling boxesfrom outlying islands, particularly in roughweather, numbers of voters were virtually disfran-chised.    The Cat met felt that it would be advis-able no^  to complicate the new Franchise Bill with provisions dealing with this matter, and that abetter plan would be, provided all parties were willing to co-operate, to introduce a separate.Bill.No decisions were taken as to the final formof the Franchise Bill, but the Cabinet agreed  (a)  That the women Secretary should re-draft the Representation ofthe People (Equal Franchise) Billin the simplest and least contentiousform in order to make provision forequalising the franchise of men andwomen, for consideration by theCabinet:
(b) Tbab the Minister of Health should prepare a Memorandum for theCabinet in regard to his proposalfor restoring the Poor Reliefdisqualification for the election of Guardians only:(c) That the Secretary of State forScotland should study the practi-ability of dealing with thespecial Scottish difficultiesreferred to above in carryingout the present law by a separate bill to be introduced onl3r bygeneral consent:(d) That the Prime Minister should consider the desirability of appointing a Cabinet Committeefor the further consideration ofthese questions:(e) ^hat the Prime Minister shouldlet it be known to the press that the Cabinet were stillstudying the Franchise Bill andhad not yet decided finally whatwas to be included therein.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,February 21, 1928.
