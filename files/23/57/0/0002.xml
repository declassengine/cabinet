government policy ,(previous reference:Cabinet 1(28), Con-o las ion 4.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer described a plan he had devised to relieve and encouragemanufacturing producers by reducing their rate burden on the average by two-thirds, and agrlcul-tural producers by abolishing their rates entirely,end freeing both of them from the uncertaintiesand variations of an antiquated rating system, thushelping trade and employment:    to raise for thispurpose a revenue by a tax, of which particularswere given to the Cabin -t:    to correct by bothprocesses the present unfair conditions between road and rail transport:    to remove the deterrentsupon successful industry in the necessitous areas:to give assistance to hard-pressed Local Authorities:to further the projects of the Ministry of health and Ministry of Transport for the creation of widerareas for Poor Relief and Road /dministrationrespectively:    and to reform the relations ofnational and local finance through the establishmentof a system of block, grants instead of percentagegrants in health services .The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to circulate particulars of his plan forthwith.While he had little doubt as to the feasibility ofhis plan,     Mr Churchill particularly desired theadvice of his colleagues as to whether the substan-tial relief which it would give to producers wouldbe sufficiently popular to justify the exertionsrequired to finance the scheme.A preliminary discussion on these proposalsthen took place, in the course of which the Presidentof the Board of Trade stated that he had had an examination made of the effects of the scheme onthe principal industries of the country, and he was
-    15   &quot;convinced that the benefit to our hard-pressedindustries would be so great that the scheme oughtto receive the most careful consideration.     He gave particulars of the advantages that might be expectedto accrue through remission of local rates and reduction of railway rates to certain of our stapleindustries,  including steel,  shipbuilding,   coal,engineering.     The advantage to textiles would be small.considered that, from the agricultural point ofview, it was impossible to exaggerate the importanceof the scheme.The Minister of Health, while supporting theprinciple underlying the scheme, namely, that alarger burden should be borne by the taxpayer andsome relief given to the producer, reserved hisopinion in regard to certain of the details.   he doubted if the revenue to be raised from taxationwould be sufficient to compensate the Local Authori-ties for the loss of rates.   He viewed with some anxiety the possibility that, when relieved from rates, manufacturers would withdraw from all active participation in local government.   And he appre-apprehended that in some districts the Local authorities would be deprived of so large a proportion of theirrateable area as to make it impossible for them tocarry out essential improvement schemes, such aswater-supply or drainage.The views expressed by other members of theCabinet wei-e favourable to the principle of thescheme, though doubts were raised on various points of detail and as to the time-stable for carrying it into effect,
