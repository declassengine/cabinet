THE indian statutory commission.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(28), Con-conclusion 9o)/a A$ 0. o1. The Secretar;/ of State for India broughtto the confidential notice of his colleagues twounfortunate Incidents which might in some degreeaffect the position of both the Labour representa-Ives on the Indian Statutory Commission.    one was a f orthcoifiing action against the members ofthe Electrical Committee of t,he Stepney borough council, which included Major Attlee , in respectof certain action taken by that Committee duringthe General Strike, and which might, in certaincircumstances , involve this member of the Commis-sion in bankruptcy proceedings.    The other oaserelated to Mr Vernon Hartshorn, against whora theIndian firm of Tata were instituting a libel actionin respect of certain remarks made by Mr Hartshorn,under great provocation, at a ver7f disorderlymeeting in his constituency.In regard to the case of Major Attlee, LordBirkenhead felt that there was no action at thepresent moment which he could recommend for theCabinet&apos;s consideration, although he understoodthat Major Attlee&apos;s case, which was shared byConservative members of the same Committee, was strong on merits.In regard to the libel action against mr. Hartshorn, hov/ever, Lord Birkenhead indicatedcertain steps which he felt entitled and boundto take with a view, if possible, to the avoidance of proceeding^.The Cabinet shared the Secretary of Statefor India&apos;s view that it would be a great mis fortuneif? anything occurred to weaken the position orprestige, and even more to lead to the resignation of, either of the members of the Commission concerned.
POLICE INQUIHY.The Hyde i Parkprosecut ion.(pieviousReference:Cabinet 29(28), Con-elusion 8. )2. The Home Secretary   infonaed the Cabinetthat  since the last Meeting he had been infrequent consultation with the Lord Chancellor inregard to the tribunal to be established for theproposed Police Inquiry.    The terms of the firstresolution which he had laid under the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, had been drawnup in consultation with the Attorney-General,Sir John Simon, and Mr Arthur Henderson.    Not onlyhad they approved the terms, but three hoursbefore laying the resolution he had sent them toMr Arthur Henderson, who, to his knowledge, hadthemread       in consultation with Mr Earns ay MacDonald.Subsequently, however, there had been protestsagainst the terms of the resolution, and eventually,after consultation with, and with the. concurrence of, the same members&quot;s of Parliament, he had amendedthe resolution lo read as follows:-&quot;That it Is expedient that a tribunal be established forinquiring into a definite matterof urgent public importance, thatis to say, the action of the police in connection with their interroga-tion of Miss Savidge on the 15th &quot;dayof May, 19-28&quot;.The resolution in these terms would cover only theinterrogation of Miss Savidge, and would not involveinquiry into the question of whether the Police loadcommitted perjury, which would virtually havereopened the whole case.In the course of a discussion which followed,attention was drawn, on the one hand, to the hardship which would have been involved to thepersons acquitted by the reopening of the wholecase;   and, on the other, to the strong feeling
which, existed in the Police Force at the suggest-ions of perjury.The Home Secretary was asked, after thepresent phase of the incident had passed, to take into careful consideration the various proposalswhich had been isade by the Magistrate and othersfor the better regulation of Hyde Park and thePolice measures to this end.The Cabinet took note that the Home secretary had arranged for the following constitution of thetribunalThe Right Hon.

In thesecircumstances he himself did not propose to give any support to the protest.-6-
6.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had received secret information to the effect that Nahas Pasha wasthinking of reopening negotiations and wascontemplating sending to London a Ministerwhose associations were such that it was doubtfulwhether consent should be given to his appoint-ment.      Sir Austen Chamberlain proposed toact on the intimation he had already given Inthe House of Commons that the negotiations forthe Treaty could, not be reopened until an egyptian Government had accepted a basis for aTreaty which was also acceptable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.Sir Austen Chamberlain further reportedthat Nahas Pasha was believed to be thinking of applying to the League of Nations for membership.After a short discussion the CabinetagreedThat the Secretary of State for  .Foreign Affairs should have a\.ithorityopenly to oppose any application from egypt for membership of the Leagueof Nations, on the ground that Es;yptwas not qualified until the reservedpoints had been settled.     He shouldha,ve dl s ere lion,  if necessary, to announce that Great Britain could, not -take part in any discussions at theLeague with the Egyptian Government.

The recommendations made by the Committee of Imperial Defence to theCabinet are as follows:-(a) That the maintenance of Busaiyahand certain other desert posts isessential for the effective defenceof Iraq by the exlstfcg garrison,and that, therefore, it is impossibleto give way to Ibn Saud on the prin-ciple involved in this question.(b) That, subject to (a) above, it is most important that Sir GilbertClayton should be put in a- positionto make an offer which will convinceIbn Saud that we are doing our best to meet him. in this matter.   Withthis object, the Air Ministry should examine the whole question of frontierposts with a view to determiningwhich are absolutely essential, andwhich,if any, could.be dispensed with.In presenting our case to Ibn Saud,emphasis should be laid on themoderation of our demands, forexample, in respect to the small number of posts in comparison withthe very large length of frontier.(c) That, subject to the King&apos;s consent,and after the necessary formalitieshave&quot; been completed, Sir GilbertClayton should be authorised toinform Ibn Saud that Jhe, himself,is to succeed Sir Henry Dobbs as high Commissioner of Iraq in due course.    This authority should.becommunicated to Sir Gilbert Claytonwith the least possible delay, andit should be left to his discretionasthe information.to when, and how, he should use(d) That, with regard to the consignmentof ammunition for Ibn Saud which isdetained at Port Sudan, it is, onthe whole, advisable to accept therisk, involved and release the ammunition.
The Prime Minister drew the attention ofthe Cabinet more particularly to Conclusion (d) ,relating: to the consignment of ammunition for TbnSaud.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the fact that Field Marshal Sir Claud   Jacobhad expressed a definite view in favour of releasing the ammunition.    Marshal of the RoyalAir Force Sir Hugh Trenchard had also assured theCommittee of Imperial Defence that no undulyadverse effects were likely to result from therelease of the ammunition.The Secretary of State for Air stated,however, that he had discussed the natter later in the day with Sir Hugh Trenchard, who regarded the matter as mainly a political question and had expressed willingness to accept the decision ofthe Cabinet without demur, though he did not wishto have the responsibility of advising the releaseof the ammunition.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (i)To approve generally the recommenda-tions of the Goiitnittee of ImperialDefence as set forth above:(ii) To take the responsibility for deciding that the ammunitionconsigned to Ibn Saud and nowdetained at Port Sudan should be released:(ill) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should communicate this decision to Sir Gilbert Claytonand Lord Lloyd, and the Secretary ofState for Air should taice anyadxainistrative steps required onhis part.

A Memorandum by the Secretary of( CP.131 (2R))    state for India suggesting thatthe question of capitation rates should be reserved for consldera-tion by another &quot;Welby&quot; Commission,the appointment of which theSecretary of State hoped would be recommended by the Simon Commission.Such a Commission would not onlymak. e recommendations regarding thefinancial relationships of the twocountries in the light of present-day facts and developments, but would also propose the establish-ment of some revised machinery fordealing with disputes regarding theallocation of expenditure which are bound to occur subsequently betweenthe India Office and the various departments of His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentThe Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Coninittee, composed asfollows  The Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for War?The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Commissioner of Works

11. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Treasury, circulated by direction of theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-137 (28)),in regard to the forthcoming introduction by theIrish Free State of a new currency0    In orderto ensure that the large quantities of Britishsilver coin in Ireland should not be sent backsecretly to this country and swell the alreadysufficient stores of silver coins in the bankshere, the Treasury desire to amend the existing law by extending the power given by Section 2of the Customs (Amendment) Act, 1886, of pro-prohibiting by Proclamation the importation ofcertain classes of foreign coin, so as to cover the importation abroad of silver coins of the realm.   The Treasury therefore proposed theintroduction of a one-Clause Bill with thisobject in the course of the present Session.In order to avoid the transfer of large quanti-ties of silver   to    Northern Ireland betweenthe introduction and the passing of the legis-lation, the Treasury further suggested forconsideration that the Bill should be introducedimmediately and passed through all stages up tothe Royal Assent with the greatest expedition.The Cabinet also had before them a Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (Paper CP.-150&quot; (28)) expressinganxiety as to the effect of legislation inthe form proposed on our future good, relationswith the Free State, and indicating his prefer-ence for the adoption of some alternativearrangement which would not involve legislation.
In any case the Secretary of State strongly urged the desirability of taking this opportunity to substitute some other expression for the word&quot;foreign&quot; (as applying to all countries, outsidethe United Kingdom) in the Customs Acts.While there was general sympathy with theChare el lor of the Exchequer&apos;s desire to avoid theIssue of a new coinage in the Irish Free Statebeing made at the expense ard to the detriment ofthis country, it was pointed out that it couldbe represented that we should only be taking backat face value a coinage which had been issued atface value and on which we had had our profit.It was farther pointed out, however, that a verygenerous financial settlement had been made withthe Irish Free State, a condition which had notapplied in the case of other Dominions to whom we had made some concessions when they adoptedtheir own coinage.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who undertook to keep in touch withthe Secretary of State for DominionAffairs on the subject, should discuss the matter with the Prei dentof the Executive Council and theMinister of Finance of the IrishFree State, with a view to arriving at some arrangement.   Mr Churchill &quot;should have discretion, if he thought fit, to show the Bill to the rep re-sehtatives of the Irish Free state in order to prove the power arxi theintention of His lua jesty8 s Governmentin Great Britain to prevent thedumping of silver In this country.He should also have authority, ifnecessary, to make some concessionwhereby some portion of the silverinvolved might be returned gradually&apos;to this country, spread over a periodpf years:(b) That the use of the word &quot;foreign&quot;(as applying; to all countries outsidethe United Kingdom) should be avoidedin the Bill.
