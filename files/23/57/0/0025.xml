0 C 92.   The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that he was nowdoubtful as to whether the revised draft Treatyof Arbitration with the United States (paper c.P.-117 (28)) would form a suitable basis ofdiscussion.    In the circumstances he thoughtthat the best plan would be to ask the UnitedStates of America to prolong the existing Anglo-American Arbitration Treaty for a few months in order to give time for further investigation of the question and consultation with theDominions.    It would first be necessary toobtain the assent of the Dominions to this c ours e.In regard to the proposed multilateralTreaty, Sir Austen Chamberlain said that hehad tried to induce the German Government to delay their reply to the United States ofAmerica.   He wished, for example,, to ascertainhow it was that the German Legal Adviser eon-sidered the American proposals to be consistent with the Locarno Treaty and the Covenant of theLeague of Nations when Sir Cecil Hurst advisedin a contrary sense.   Unfortunately, however,the German Government had replied that it was too late to delay their Note to the UnitedStates of America, which amounted to an accept-anco of the proposals.   Various proposals hadbeen made for dealing with this question.    a french suggestion for a Con-Terence of the legal advisers of the Governments affected other thanthe American Government did not appeal to him.Mr Kellogg had thrown out a suggestion that if
M. Briand would wish the proposed Treaty to be signed in Paris, there should be a Conference ofForeign Ministers which the American Secretaryof State himself would be ready to attend.Sir Austen Chamberlain intimated that at the next meeting he would like the Cabinet to consider aproposal that there should be first a Conferenceof the Jurists of all the nations concerned,including the United States of America, whichshould be followed by a Conference of foreign ministers.   By this means it might be possibleto obtain a formal admission by the United Statesof America that the text had a significance whichwould render it acceptable to other nations aswell.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should send an urgent message to the Governmentsof the Dominions giving someexplanation of the position and asking for a prolongation of theexisting Treaty of Arbitrationwith the United States for aperiod of (say)  eight months,in order to give time for furtherinvestigations and exchange of views:(b) That Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;sproposals in regard to    the suggested multilateral treaty should be reserved for consid-eration at the next Meeting ofthe Cabinet.
EGYPT. 3. The Seoretary of State for Foreign Affairsanswered one or two questions in regard to the(previous reference: position in Egypt, but no decisions were takenCabinet 24(28), Con- or ashed for.elusion 4.)The Secretary of State for War drew attention to the fact that Egypt was in defaixltas regards several annual contributions towardsthe cost of the Army of Occupation.    If it became necessary to seize the Customs there might bean opportunity to reimburse the Treasury inthis respect.   He reported that the forces inEgypt were deemed sufficient for any immediateemergency.
jlBXT MEETING 4.    The Secretary was instructed to notifyOP CABINET .the Cabinet that Wednesday&apos;s Meeting would beheld at 12 Noon,  instead of at 11-30.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 30,  1928.
