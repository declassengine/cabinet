The Secretary of State for India drew theattention of hi3 colleagues to a Memorandum hehad circulated for their information regardingthe political situation in India in relation tothe Indian Statutory Commission (Paper C.P.-107 (28)).   Lord Birkenhead said that thisMemorandum, with the telegrams contained therein,would acquaint the Cabinet fully with the circum-stances in which the Simon Commission had leftIndia.   On the whole, the Commission, in thisearly preparatory visit, had succeeded betterthan could have been hoped.

The commission was due home at Victoria Station on the 14thApril by the P. &amp; 0. Express.

The Cabinet had before them the InterimReport of a Cabinet Committee on the question(previousof the Basel Trading Company (Paper C.P.-108(28))Reference:Cabinet 13(28), Con-elusion 6.)containing the following majority and minorityrecommendations respectively:-The Committee accordingly by a majorityrecommend the Cabinet:-That the Basel Trading company should be informed forthwiththat His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis prepared to settle the claimupon the tearms of their offer of 28th March, subject to thesubstitution of the followingproviso for proviso (b) ofthat offer:-&quot;Provided that the Societyundertake to adhere to theirestablished practice ofdevoting a substantial pro-portion of their distributableprofits to missionary and otherphilanthropic purposes in all parts of the world (Includingthe British Empire) (throughthe medium of trustees) andthat in the application ofsuch proportion full regardwill be paid to the needs ofthe Gold Coast Colony on a scale not less than has been followed in the past.&quot;A minority of the Committee wish to add that, in the event of the Com-pany rejecting this proposal, theclaim should be settled on the basisof the offer of 28th March, subjectto the substitution of the Company&apos;sformula for proviso (b) .The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that the Basel Company had now accepted the undertaking suggested in themajority recommendation. The Company, however,had made certain requests;    for example, thatthe Government of the Gold Coast Colony shouldnot be authorised to initiate an Inquiry intothe affairs of the Basel Trading Company without
the authority of the Secretary of State for theColonies, and that when the subject is discussed in the House of Commons a kindly word shouldbe said about the Company&apos;s activities. Mr Amerysaid he was hopeful that no cost would fall onthe Treasury,   He hoped that the full burden of 250,000 would not fall on the Gold Coast Colony,since the Colony, he anticipated, would be reimbursed to the extent of perhaps as much as 70,000 from payments from the Company for the assets to be returned to them on an agreedvaluation.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) To approve the formula proposedby the majority of the CabinetCommittee,  and set forth above,as the basis for an agreementwith the Basel Trading Company:(b) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, in replying to aQuestion in the House of commons the same afternoon, should beauthorised to state that when hewas in a position to announce afinal settlement he had good reason to believe that he wouldbe in a position to announce thatthe Basel Trading Company had given an undertaking to adhere to their established practice ofdevoting a substantial proportionof their distributable profits tomissionary -and other philanthropicpurposes:(c) that the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised to write to Mr MacMillan and toMr Roy Wilson, MCPC, expressingin suitable terms the apprecia-tion and thanks of His Majesty&apos;sCovemment for their efforts in bringing about successful negotia-tIons with the Basel Trading Company.
