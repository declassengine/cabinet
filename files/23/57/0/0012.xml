1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that it seemed probable thatthe proposed Anglo-Egyptian Treaty &quot;would not be signed.   Sarwat Pasha seemed to have lost heart.whoir he had shown the Treaty, app^a^e&amp;Hstr^bae-ltcourage.    &quot;In these circumstances Sir austen chamberlain proposed to send a despatch to lord was refused, In which attention would be called tocertain legislation now contemplated in Egyptwhich was causing FIs Majesty7s Government somemisgivings, and in which he wou^d reserve our right to take such action as we might deem neces-sary to fulfil our responsibilities in Egypt.This would show Sarwat Pasha, or his successor,that FiB Majesty&apos;s Government intended to standby the four points reserved in 1922.and Nahas Pasha, ene-of-SarwiLloyd, which he could use at the moment the Treaty
if cDOIRAQ,.The AKhwanRaids.(previous reference:Cabinet 56(27), Con-clusion 5.)2. The Secretary o&quot;^ State for Air informed theCabinet that the operations undertaken for theprotection of Iraq against the Akhwan raiderswere difficult but were proceeding normally, andthere was no reason for misgiving.    Cur actionappeared to have qroat--jd a^r^atC-Hjis4^^b^6^e^inAs^abi-a, but ^he Air Officer Commanding, and the consul at Kuweit, both took the view that therewas no cause for alarm.   The Resident at Bushire,on the other side of the Persian Gulf, appearedto take an unnecessarily alarmist view.   Sir samuel hoare was taking steps to bring units from palestine and Egypt rather nearer to the scene.It would be difficult to estimate the full effects of our action for some time, but, so far as couldbe judged, the result appeared favour-able.   TheSecretary of State for Air said he had arranged with the Secretary of State for the Colonies to circulate a Joint Memorandum giving a summary ofthe inception and present position of the opera-tions.
THE PROPOSED 3    The Prime Minister stated that circumstancesBAGHDAD-haifa railway   AND now rendered it desirable to investigate furtherPIPELINE.the question of the Baghdad-Haifa Railway, and informed his colleagues that he proposed to refer it to a Committee composed as follows:-The Prime Minister (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for theColonies.The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The President of the Board of Trade.Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary)Commander L.BeH. Maund(Assistant Secretary).The Secretary of State for War said he didnot wish the War Office to be represented on theCommittee, but if any military matter should arise he hoped that a representative would beinvited to attend for that discussion.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs expressed his willingness to be represented bythe Permanent Under-Secretary of State at thefirst meeting of the Committee on Wednesday,March 7th, when Sir Austen Chamberlain himself would be at Geneva.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 11(28), Con-clusion 5C)

It was feltthat this would accentuate the difficulties of
the Government In the forthcoming Debate next week in the House of lords.It was felt that some communication oughtto be made to the Government of Northern Irelandand, as the matter relates partly to finance andpartly to Civil Service Regulations, the Chancel-lor of the Exchequer,, at the request of theCabinet, x^-nderbook to write privately to LordCraigevcn^, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,with a view, if possible, to inducing him to comeinto line on the ma beer with the Governmentsof Great Britain and the Irish Free State, andto support the Government in the debate in the House of Lords.

Mr Ramsay MacDonald wasonly asking for half a day of Parliamentary time,which the Prime Minister felt it would be necessaryto grant.The Cabinet were informed that the LabourParty were likely to demand a fresh Inquiry intothe case of the Zinovieff Letter.   A suggestion was made that the question might be referred tothe same Committee that had inquired into the caseof the Civil Servants, but it was pointed outthat the Opposition would probably press for a select Committee.   It was suggested that therewould be some advantages In an Inquiry which wouldclear up the mystery and set at rest the rumoursand suggestions circulated in regard to thismatter, but the Cabinet were reminded that anyInquiry would in effect be considering a matter on which a Cabinet Committee had passed judgment.The position of the informants abroad as to theZinovief^ Letter also had to be safeguarded.The Prime Minister said there would be anopportunity for the Cabinet to discuss the merits of the question befor- the Debate, and he askedhis colleagues in the meanwhile to consider thepolitical and other aspects of the desirabilityor otherwise of granting an Inquiry.
