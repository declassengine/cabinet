tfjqElGN CAPITALElectricalAmericanCapital-(previous inference:Cabinet 14(go), Con-oiuslon ow1. The Cabinet had before them a Report bythe Committee of Civil Research (Paper C.P.-145 (28)) on the following Terms of Reference:-*To examine the facts with regardto the influx of American capital and control into electricalcompanies In this country, andto advise whether any undesirableconsequences are to be expected--- especially In the form oforders for equipment being givenabroad   and whether anypreventive measures can or shouldbe adopted&quot;.The Conclusions and Recommendations are summarxsedin Part IV of the Report as follows:-&quot;(i) The influx of American capitalinto the British electricalindustry, either (a) for invest-ment purposes or (b) fox- thepurpose of acquiring control,does not appear at present tobe large.(ii) Mo objection can be taken on public grounds to purchases ofBritish shares by Americans for investment purposes.(iii) As regards the introduction of american capital for the purposeof obtaining control, no objec-tion need be taken to Americanpurchases on their present scale.It is unlikely that Americancontrol will result in ordersfor equipment being given inthe United States by American-controlled companies, or that american engineers will be Intro-due ed by American-controlled companies.    Further, the present difficulties in regard to elec-trical prices are not likely tobe increased by the introductionof American control, as the trend of American policy is to aim at asmall profit on a large turnover.In view, however, of possible developments, we recommend  That arrangements should bemade by the Minister of Trans-portto keep under periodical review -(a) The general question of the investment of American capital in British Electrical companies for the purpose of obtainingCO &quot;t T*n 11OOd
(b) The particular question ofthe extent of the employmentof American engineers, parti-cularly in key positions, whichmight have an important bearing that the case of a national emergency&quot;.The Cabinet approved the Report ofthe Committee of Civil Research(Paper CP.--145 (28)), and the PrimeMinister instructed the Secretary tocommunicate to the Committee ofImperial Defence any extracts fromthe Report that might be of interestto them.
2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Home Secretary on the subject of a bill introduced by a Private Member (Mr Buehan) onthe subject of Dog Racing (Paper 0.P.-143 (28)).This Memorandum contained much information derivedfrom the supporters and opponents of the Bill,as well as from the Police authorities, on theeffects of the dog-racing movement.   The HomeSecretary stated in the Memorandum that in theSecond Reading. Debate he proposed to state ashis personal view that he favoured the principleof Mr Buchan&apos;s Bill, namely, that Local Authori-ties should have discretionary power to license,subject to conditions, or not to license, a proposed dog-racing track, but he proposedexpressly to reserve the right, at a later stage,to suggest amendments, e.g., to make it clearthat there must be a real exercise of discretionby licensing authorities, and no harsh andunconscionable closing of existing tracks.The Home Secretary asked the Cabinet to agreethat facilities should be given as soon as prac-ticable for a Second Reading Debate, with a free vote, and that if the Bill obtains a SecondReading facilities should be given at a later date for further stages, if possible.The Home Secretary reminded the Cabinetthat this question had been on the Agenda Paperat their last Meeting, but,  owing to pressure ofother business, had not been taken.    It had beenagreed on the afternoon of the Cabinet Meeting,at a Conference of Ministers presided over bythe Prime Minister, that the Chief Whip should,
if possible, find a day, or even half a day,for the discussion of this measure;    that theGovernment should remain neutral in the Debate;and that Sir William Joynson-Hicks himselfshould place the facts ascertained from thePolice before the House of Commons.   The chief whip had since suggested that the matter shouldbe discussed in Parliament on Friday, May 11th,which, for various reasons, would be a convenientdate,
HASP PURCHASE,northernIreland.(previous cmsRef erene e:Cabinet 4(26), Con-elusion 10.)3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Home Secretary (Paper C.P.-146 (28))regarding the position of Land Purchase inNorthern Ireland, which is causing seriousanxiety to the Government of Northern ireland as well as to the Home Secretary.    It appearsthat the number of holdings as to which no precise information was available when the Actwas passed was much under-estimated, and thatin 1929, by which time the bulk of the schemewas to have been completed, there would still bea carry-over of about half the number of holdingswhich it would take a further period of threeyears to cover.   The tenants concerned would,in consequence, not be getting as good terms asthey were led to expect when they accepted theAct, and would have a legitimate grievance.Attached to the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum wasa scheme for meeting this difficulty at a costof  50,000 to  60,000, the whole of which theGovernment of Northern Ireland was prepared toprovide, none of the cost falling, directly or indirectly, on the British taxpayer.   The HomeSecretary in his Memorandum therefore asked tohave authority to invite the Government ofNorthern Ireland to open up negotiations withrepresentatives of the landlox^s and tenantson the basis of the above scheme.    If agreement could be reached, legislation would be necessary,but need not be introduced until next Session.
sIn the course of the discussion the cabinet were informed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, from personal experience, thatinvestigations of the officials entrusted withthe procedure in ascertainment of title, etc.,were over-meticulous, and the Home secretary undertook to distvuss this question in the nearfuture with the Prime Minister of NorthernIreland.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Home Secretary as set forth in his Memorandum (Paper CP.-146 (28))and summarised above.
JS irishjree state.CompensationOlaiirs underArticle 10 ofthe Articlesof Agreement.1921.(previous reference reference e:Cabinet 24(28), Con-elusion 12.)4.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (paper c.P.-144 (28)) circulating for information acopy of the letter which he had addressed toMr Blythe, the Free State Minister of Finance,after discussion with the Lord Chancellor,inviting him to eotre over to England at once todiscuss the form of legislation with theSecretary of State, the Lord Chancellor, andthe Free State Attorney-General.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that he had arranged for ameeting with the Attorney-G-eneralfe of Nogt-tkoamIreland-and the Irish Free State to take placeearly next week.The Lord Chancellor and the Lord privy seal assured the Cabinet that the Debates In theHouse of Lords left no doubt that the legislationproposed by the Irish Free State would not be acceptable and that provision ought to be madein some way for a re-hearing of the compensation claims.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Lord Chancellor undertook, at their meeting with the Irish Law Officers referred toabove, to insist on the need for this.The Cabinet approved the procedureoutlined above.
m NATIONALgOOTXiAND,5. The Cabinet had before their a Memorandum(previous reference:by the Secretary of State for Scotland (paper c.P.--139    (28))  reporting a second offer of 100,000 (i.e., over and above the gift he hadalready made for the provision of an endowmentfund) by Sir Alexander Grant with a view to theerection of new buildings for the Library, onthe site of the present Sheriff Court House in edinburgh.    This would involve the provision ofa new Sheriff Coux^t House.    It was hoped thatthe Sheriff Court authorities would contribute50 per cent, of the cost, but there would still remain some considerable expenditure to be borneby the Exchequer.The Cabinet agreed -(a) Subject to the concurrence ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer,to approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for scotland as set forth in Paper CP.-139 (.28)):(b) That the Secretary of State forScotland should have authorityto inform Sir Alexander Grantof the acceptance of his offer,subject to certain negotiations now proceeding.

The Secretary of State for Scotland read to the Cabinet a telegram which, had been approvedby the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conferenceand despatched on May 3rd to the Governments ofthe Dominions and India, a copy being communi-communicated to the Irish Free State Government bydespatch.Owing to its secrecy this telegram isnot reproduced, but a copy has been attachedto the standard copy of the Cabinet conclusions which is held by the Secretary at the disposalof members of the Cabinet.
eJ if k*ijrb TITLE 7.    Arising out of the short discussion oniglS MAJESTY&apos; SGOVERNMENT IN        the subject referred to in the previous Conclu-&amp;REAT BRITAIN.sion, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(previous reported that he had received representationsReference:Cabinet 63 froro Northern Ireland objecting to the use of(26), Con-clusion 2.) the term &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in GreatBritain&quot;,    it had been brought to his notice that, since the change in the Eing&apos;s Title,there was a United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland, and he had been asked whether some title based on this fact could not besubstituted for that now in use.   The Secretaryof State said that he had instructed the ForeignOffice to consult the Government Departmentsconcerned, and he hoped that any Minister whoseDepartment was concerned and who might byinadvertence not have been consulted wouldinstruct his Office to communicate with theForeign Office on the subject.
ei *J tidijjB UNITEDSTATES OPArbitrationproposals */foe, Multi-lateralTreaty.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(28), Oon-clusion 2 .)8. The Cabinet had before them a record of a con-yersation between Sir Austen Chamberlain and theAmerican Ambassador which had taken  place on May 3,1928, and which, in the form of a despatch to Washing-ton, had been communicated to the Cabinet on theprevious evening (Appendix).   This conversation had had the effect of altering the whole situation as presented to the Cabinet at their previous Meeting.The American Ambassador had stated that the American secretary of State had never contemplated a conferenceof Foreign Ministers (as reported by Sir E. Howard onApril 13th (Washington telegram No. 120)), which hethought would be useless and even harmful. Mr Kelloggwas now reported by the Ambassador to be definitelyopposed, and for the same reasons,  to a conference ofJurists, of which he had heard from other sources.Mr Houghton had offered a fairly full explanation of the American point of view, based on Mr Kellogg&apos;sspeech of last Saturday.    Sir Austen Chamberlain gavesome additional information of a highly confidentialcharacter as to what Mr Houghton had said, as well ascertain information received from M. de Fleuriau,which he had not thought it desirable to record inwriting.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had,in consequence, withdrawn the proposals he had made toother Powers in pursuance of the last decision of theCabinet with a view to a meeting of Jurists, to befollowed later by a Conference of Foreign Ministers.After full discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in the light of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs&apos;  con-versation on the previous day, theywould approve Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;proposal to proceed on the lines of accepting the draft multilateralTreaty circulated by the United
States Government, subject toa clear statement of the signi-fioance which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment attach to it.   this interpretation of the treaty should be based, as far aspossible, on the speech madeby Mr Kellogg on April 28th(Sir S. Howard&apos;s telegram, from washington No.136, of April 30th):(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should prepare,for early consideration by theCabinet, a draft despatch to theUnited States of America to giveeffect to this decision:(c) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should send tothe Dominions a telegram, concertedwith the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, explaining thenew development and the policynow proposed, and promising to telegraph to them the terms ofthe draft despatch referred toin (b) above:(d) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should immediatelyplace himself in communicationwith the French Ambassador with aview to concerting our policy withthat of the French, and that sir Austen Chamberlain shouldhave authority and full discre-tion, if he thought fit, to offer to pay a visit to Paris in orderto discuss the matter with M.Eriandand other French Ministers:(e) That the Secretary to the Cabinet-should circulate at once the full report of Mr Kellogg&apos;s speech ofApril 28th as reported in &quot;The Times&quot;.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 4, 1928.
A P P E N I) I X.Record of a Conversation between Sir austen chamberlain and the American Amtassador. 5rd May, 1928.(Despatch to Washington).JSir,The American Ambassador sought an interview with methis morning;    it lasted for an hour and twenty minutes and was ofthe highest consequence.Mr. Houghton began by reading an extract from a tele-graphic despatch which he had just received from Mr, Kellosrg.In this telegram Mr. Kellogg stated that he had never contemplateda meeting of Foreign Ministers to discuss the American proposalfor a multilateral treaty;    that he saw no need for such a meeting and no usefulness  in it;    he did not understand how Your Excellencycould have derived the impression that he favoured it.     Mr. Hough-ton went on to say that from other sources the American Governmenthad learned that there was a proposal in the air for a preliminary meeting of jurists and. he read a further passage from Mr. Kellogg&apos;despatch in which the Secretary of State expressed himself withequal force and for the same reasons as entirely opposed to such anidea.      He saw no reason for such discussions;    they could have no useful result.I told the Ambassador that I had listened with deepregret to his expression of Mr. Kellogg&apos;s strong disapproval ofboth these suggestions.      There had evidently been a complete mis-understanding between Mr. Chilton and the Secretary of State.      Thesuggestion for a meeting of the Foreign Ministers which I thoughthad emanated from Mr. Kellogg himself had seemed to me a most help-ful and fruitful one.      If- it were prepared as the Locarno confer-
oboence of Ministers had been by a preliminary discussion among thejurists who could exchange information and explanations, it wouldprobably greatly simplify and facilitate the task of the foreign ministers.      But if this procedure were rejected, what proceduredid Mr. Kellogg contemplate?      How were the six Powers to reach agreement?   Were our Notes and. despatches to go chasing one another round the world or was each of us to carry on a separatecorrespondence with Washington?     Surely anything of the kind would greatly Increase our difficulties and impede progress.Besides there must be some interchange of views between thosewho already had treaty obligations to one another, but if theirjurists met alone without an American, what suspicions wouldnot their meeting breed?The Ambassador again stated that neither he nor Mr.Kellogg could see the need for any International conference.He knew that Mr. Kellogg&apos;s view had been much influenced by theknowledge that the German Government had been advised by Dr.Gauss that there was no incompatibility between the Americantext and. their existing obligations.      If Germany had been ableto give a quick and unqualified acceptance of the american proposal, why could not the other Powers do the same?      Whatafter all was the difficulty?    I should have no doubt observed the speech delivered by Mr. Kellogg on Saturday last in which he had explained, the intention and meaning of the American proposal.Summarising Mr. Kellogg&apos;s points, Mr. Houghton resumed them asfollows:    the right of self-defence was inherent in everytreaty, it required no special reservation;    the Covenant of theLeague of Nations does not impose an obligation to go to warand there is no contradiction between it and the American pro-posal to renounce a war as an instrument of policy.      The UnitedStates Government have no desire to injure the Covenant and
equally they have no desire to interfere, with the treaties of Locarno, but any Power which incurred the sanctions of    397Locarno would in so doing necessarily have broken theproposed treaty for the renunciation of war which would thus,far from weakening the work accomplished at Locarno, support and buttress it.     Mr. Kellogg^ fourth point had been the treaties of neutrality, by which were meant such engagementsas united, for example, Prance and Poland,     Mr. Houghtonsaid that he was not aware of th6 terms of that Treaty, buton my Informing him of them he agreed that if, as urged byMr. Kellogg, there was no contradiction between the american proposal and the Covenant of the League or the Treaties of locarno, then there would be no contradiction between theAmerican proposal and the mutual obligations of Poland and france, narrowly restricted as they had bean to the ease ofself-defence in the new version initialled at Locarno.Next Mr. Kellogg in the speech in question had mentioned the French observations about the case of a party which, after signing the American proposal, broke itsengagement.     Mr. Kellogg had observed that ipso facto theother Powers to the American Treaty would be released from allobligations towards the Treaty-breaking State.     There remainedonly the question of universality, and Mr. Kellogg held that,whilst most Powers wovild probably be ready to sign such anagreement, it would be an act of the highest significance forthe maintenance of peace even if it were confined to theUnited States and the five great Powers immediatelyaddressed.The Ambassador then developed his &quot;personal&quot; ideasupon this point.     He said Mr. Kellogg1s speech had met withthe highest acceptance and approval in the United States:.     Theacceptance by Germany of the American invitation had been warmly welcomed; any appearance of a check from another quarter, anyappearanee of reluctance to make a solemn renunciation of theidea of settling differences by war and of finding some other-iil-
9 0 omeans for their solution would have the most deplorableresults, whilst on the other hand the broad acceptance of thatgreat principle would throw into the shade all sorts ofdisturbing questions - belligerent rights or what not - andwould, in his opinion, give a new safeguard to the presentstatus quo in Europe and a new security that, if existingfrontiers were ever to be changed, it must be by other meansthan war and would have a profound and lasting effect uponthe maintenance of peace.     Mr. Houghton spoke with greatearnestness both as to the danger to Anglo-American relations which would arise from any appearanco of reluctance on our part and as to the lasting advantages not only to ourrelations but to Europe of a hearty and unqualifiedacceptance of it.     Twice, with particular reference to theeffect on future American policy, he repeated that if I could see my way to sign the two articles of the American treaty in the form and in the spirit in which they were offered, theman who had done so would still be considered, generationshence, as one of the great benefactors of the world.I replied to the Ambassador that I trusted that myspeech last Thursday in Birmingham and my declaration in theBouse of Commons had shown clearly to him and to the UnitedStates Government that my own Government earnestly desiredto go to meet the American   proposal with the largest measureof sympathy and acceptance.     The Ambassador might think thatI was unduly under the impression of my experiences atGeneva;    perhaps I was, but it had been my not uncommonfate there to be confronted with large, generous propositionsor engagements proposed, and sometimes accepted, by men, whoif you examined those proposals quietly with them, admitted that they either did not mean whet they said or that theywere incepable of execution.     I was, I repeated, most anxiousto take full advantage of the proposal which had come from-iv-
Mr. Kellogg, but I wanted to be sure that, if we signed theTreaty, we all meant the same tiling and that we should notbe exposed to subsequent accusations of bad faith becauseyears afterwards we discovered that we had used language with different meanings.     Above all did I feel the necessity ofcaution in this respect as between ourselves and the UnitedStates of America, for Mr. Houghton knew as well as I didwhat charges of ill-faith had been spread against us in theUnited States in respect of the Washington Treaty of naval disarmament, even though the United States Secretary of theNavy had borne testimony to our loyal observance of our obligations.Here, I said, I must recur again to the monroe doctrine for, as I had before remarked to him, we too had ourMonroe Doctrino in regard to Egypt and perhaps some other areas.     Only yesterday in our Note to the egyptian government we^had reaffirmed our Declaration of 1922.     If Iwere at this moment proposing to the House of Commons theimmediate acceptance of the United States declaration, Ishould at once be asked whether that acceptance affected our declaration that we would not tolerate forcible interferenceby foreign Powers in Egypt.     When I had mentioned thissubject to Mr. Houghton the other day, he had deprecated the putting of such questions, but he had replied that for himselfhe would consider that the American proposal left our respective Monroe Doctrines unaffected, and that it must beassumed that a Power which renounced war would notdeliberately provoke war by taking action which it knew mustresult in war.     Was that an answer, I enquired, which I might give in the House of Commons?     Would it be acceptable to Mr, Kellogg?Mr. Houghton replied that that was his personal view.     Everybody knew what would happen if the Monroe Doctrinewere attacked, but nobody did attack it or desire to attack it
any more than anyone desired to attack our position in Egypt.He could not see that either were menaced by anyone or were affected by the terms of Mr. Kellogg1s proposed Treaty.     Ireplied that if I could be assured of this it went a longway to removo my difficulties, though I could not say off-hand that it necessarily removed&quot; them all.   Again Mr. Houghtonpressed the larger aspects of the question.     Again he spokeboth of the vast possibilities which a .plain and sweepingdeclaration such as Mr. Kellogg proposed would have and ofthe grave consequences which might follow the failure ofthis effort for peace, and. once again he deprecated mostearnestly a conference of jurists or Ministers in which weshould put to one another questions to ascertain exactlyhow far we could go in the direction of war instead of broadlyannouncing our determination to settle our differences byother means QI told the Ambassador that I was very glad to havehad this conversation with him, as, misled by the supposedwillingness and even desire of Mr. Kellogg to have a conferenceof Ministers, I had been proceeding on different lines and i must now report to my colleagues at the earliest possible moment what he had said and consider the question afresh inthe light of it.I was inclined to agree with Mr. Kellogg that theright of self-defence was inherent and that no specialreservation of it was necessary.     The Covenant and the Treatyof Locarno were our principal international obligations and if,as Mr, Kellogg had explained,  there was nothing- inconsistent with them in the signature of his proposed treaty, but that onthe contrary the signature of that treaty would reinforce them,that covered our principal preoccupation which was that, inendeavouring to effect an additional guarantee of the peace of the world, we should not destroy or impair the measure of
security which we had already  achieved In Europe.     With the neutrality treaties I had already dealt.     In regard to thereleaso of the signatories from any obligation to a power which resorted to war, Mr. Kellogg&apos;s speech seemed to have met the French point of view;    and though I thought that someStates outside the six great Powers ought to be associated withthe Treaty from the first, I had no doubt that those states would be willing and Indeed anxious to join and I did not thinkthat universality ought to bo a condition of our signature.Mr. &apos;Houghton had referred to what he spoke of as &quot;theunqualified&quot; acceptance of Germany,    Mr. Houghton remarked theword was Mr. Kellogg&apos;s.     I said that I had observed thatMr. Kellogg had used it -and had been a little surprised.     I felt that it was an exaggeration.     I had indeed been a littleanxious at the first rumour that Germany was going to give an&quot;unqualified&quot; acceptance and had asked Dr. Stresomann to give me an opportunity for an interchange of views before theGerman Note was sent, as Germany and we had mutual obligations and I was very anxious that no difference should arise between us.     When my communication reached Dr. Stresemann, matters hadalready advanced so far that he was unable to comply, but I hadbeen much reassured when I read the text of the German Note,for in that Note Dr. Stresemann had observed that Germany had certain pre-existing obligations which she must observe, thatthese in her case ^ere only the Covenant and the Treaties of locarno and that she saw no contradiction between the Americandraft and those obligations, and that therefore she was readyto discuss the American draft at any moment.     This was after all very much my own position; provided we clearly understoodwhat we meant and all meant the same thing my purpose? would beachieved.     I did not refer to the further qualificationsintroduced into the last paragraph of the German Notes&quot;* !,/.&apos;J-vii-
