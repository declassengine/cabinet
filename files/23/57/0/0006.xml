THE KTNGfSSPEECH.Debate on.(previous reference!Cabinet 5(28), Con-clusion 1 &amp;Appendix0)1. The Prime Minister asked that the membersof the Cabinet who sit in the House of commons should arrange among themselves that one of them is always on the Government Bench during thediscussions on the KingTs Speech.As regards the amendment to be moved by theLabour Party, the Prime Minister said that, inthe absence through indisposition of the Ministeiof Labour, he himself and the President of theBoard of Trade would make the necessary arrange-ments on behalf of the Government.-1-
REPRESENTATIONOP THE PEOPLE(EOJJAL FRAN-franchise) BILL.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 4(28), Con-eiusions and 7.)2.   The Cabinet agreed  That the Representation ofthe People (Equal Franchise)Bill should be discussed attheir next Meeting.
THE UNITEDSTATES OPAMERICAArbitrationProposals a(previous reference:Cabinet 1(28), Oon-clusion 2*)3, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State -^or Foreign Affairs(Paper 0oP.-22 (28)) bearing on -(i) The Franco-American negotiationsfor the completion of a Pact of friendship, and(ii) The American Draft of an Arbi-tration Treaty to replace theexisting Root*-Bryce arbitration treaty on its expiration nextJune.In this Memorandum the Secretary of Statecommented that it was premature to express adefinite opinion on the Draft Treaty until weare in possession of the Report of the GenevaSecurity Commission which is enquiring into the reservations appropriate to Treaties of Arbitra-tion.   He also thought it advisable to await the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on the question of BelligerentRights at Sea before expressing a definiteopinion,,   In the meantime Sir Austen suggestedit would be well that the Dominion governments should be informed as soon as possible of thepreliminary opinion reached by His majesty&apos;s government of Great Britain in regard to thetwo Draft Treaties and should be invited togive us the benefit of their observations onthea e inst rumen ts .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsconsidered it premature to discuss the question until he had received details of the treaty which had just been signed between the UnitedStates of America and France.   He added thatthe French Ambassador had notified the ForeignOffice that the French Government consideredthat the corresponding Arbitration Treaty between
Great Britain and Prance, which would terminatein the near future, would also require revisionin order to show some advance in arbitration.In the course of a short discussion,attention was drawn to the close connection between the American Arbitration Treaty and theSecurity discussions at Geneva, in regard towhich Lord Salisburyfs Cabinet Committee onReduction and Limitation of Armaments (Policy)would be meeting on Friday,  February 10th.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that If any alterations were contem-plated in the instructions to the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster the question should againcome before the Cabinet.It was pointed out that the American Arbi-tration Treaty was also affected by the questionof Belligerent Rights at Sea, since the reserva-tions contained in the draft Treaty communicated by the American Secretary of State did not include the question of Belligerent Rights at sea, and the question of making a special reserva-tion would therefore arise.The suggestion was made that the Sub-Defence on BelligerentCommittee of the Committee of Imperial/Rights at sea should not overlook the question-of whetherthe circumstances o^ the 30th Century had or hadnot affected the interests of the British empire in this question.
d iCHINA.Reduction of forces in theFar East.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 3(28)    Con-clusion 6.)A., The Cabinet had before them, a Note by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty reporting that,provided that the political situation   in China in the interval gives rise to no necessity for modifying this arrangement, the Third destroyer flotilla would be withdrawn from China aboutthe beginning of May(.paper C.P.,-28 (28)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked that the question might be reserved untilthe next Meeting of the Cabinet, as he was in communication with the British Minister in peking on the subject.    Sir Austen Chamberlainmentioned that Sir Miles Lampson had protested against the decision being taken to withdraw the Coldstream Guards from China without fullnotice having been given to him.The First Lord of the Admiralty reportedthat the Commander-in-Chief in China had alsoprotested at not being consulted in regard tothe withdrawal of the Coldstream Guards.   he hoped in future that the Naval Commander-in-Chiefwould be given ample notice of any such inten-tions.--a        r\The question was postponed until thenext regular Meeting of the Cabinet.
REDUCTION OPEXPENDITURE .(previous reference:Cabinet 5(28), Con-clusion 2.)THE BOXERINDEMNITY.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(28), Con-elusion 3.)REDUCTION OPCIVIL SERVICESTAFFS.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(26), Con-elusion l( f) o)5. The Cabinet had before there the following documents relating to Reduction of Expenditurein 1928:-A Most Secret Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer(Paper C0?.-523 (27)) eircu-lating   in accordance with cabinet 62 (27) Conclusion3 (b)  , a summary of a schemefor reducing expenditure andavoiding new taxation:A Most Secret Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer(Paper C.P.-20 (28)) contain-ing the results of the efforts of Departments to achieve theprogramme circulated in 0oPo-323 (27)  :A further Most Secret Note bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper CcPo-31 (28)) givingdetails of the present position-and containing further proposals ----for reductions by  2,220,000.In this latter Note it was pointedout that if9 as at present sug-gested, the Vote on Account iate be taken on February 28th,all Civil Service Estimates mustbe closed not later than February16th, and the Ministry of HealthEstimate not later than February11th.The Cabinet had a short discussion in regardto the various proposals in the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s Memorandum, and a number of objections were, raised.   The Secretary of State for Air, Inparticular, pointed to the great difficulty hewould have in making further reductions in hisEstimates after the great economies which, withthe assistance of Marshal of the Royal Air force sir Hugh trenchard, he had already achieved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referredto a scheme which had been drawn up for reducingthe numbers of Civil Servants over a period ofyears, partly by the disappearance of Departmentalactivities standing over from the War, and partly by measures designed to reduce the number of new
v.entries to the Service.   He appealed to theService Departments to make correspondingreductions, and, if possible, to notify themin time for inclusion in the White Paper inwhich he would announce the scheme referred toabove some six weeks hence.The First Lord of the Admiralty reportedthat the question was under investigation by aSpecial Committee at the Admiralty under theChairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary;t-o-make-- another -effort in this direct! on.The decision as to what economies are tobe achieved was recognised to be connected withthe proposal for utilising the funds of the EoxerIndemnity, which had been discussed at theprevious Meeting.The Prime Minister pointed out that several of the proposals concerned the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary ofState for War, both of whom were due home atthe end of the week.    He proposed that the ques-tion should be discussed later on, at a meetingeither of the Cabinet or of the Economy Committee.
-8-6.    In connection with the discussion referredto in the preceding Conclusion, the Lord privy seal gave the Cabinet warning that as soon ashe had completed the compilation of certain factshe would once more have to bring before theCabinet the question of the Irish Loyalists.
7.    In the course of the discussion onReduction of National Expenditure, attention was drawn to telegrams from New Zealand and australia in regard to the proposal to charge to the empire marketing Board a direct grant of  25,000 forthe British Industries Pair.    It was felt that,if the replies from Canada and South africa should prove satisfactory, it would be desirableto send a further telegram to the Prime Ministerof the Commonwealth of Australia asking for are-eonsideraticn of his refusal to sanction theproposal.
