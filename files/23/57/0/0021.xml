THE IRISH FREESTATS.1. The  Time Minister drew attention to aQuestion to &quot;be asked the same afternoon in theHouse of Commons by Colonel Howard-Bury -ComoensationClaims under To ask tne Prime Minister whetherArticle 10 of be can now make a statement withthe Articles of regard to the position of IrishAgreement, 1921. Civil Servants under Article 10of the Treaty, In view of theannouncement of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment    to allow legislation to be passed to nullify thedecision o^ the Privy Council,or whether, in view of theConstitutional questions thatarise and the interest that istaken in this question, he will now give a day to debate thismatter&quot; .The Prime Minister pointed out tha,t on a previous occasion he had stated that if there was ageneral desire for a Debate the Governmentwould afford the necessary opportunity.    this meant, o^ course, a desire on the part of all three Parties, and he had not yet been advisedon this subject by the Whips.The suggestion was made that theopportunity would be forthcoming when thenecessary legislation (details of which werenot settled) was introduced, and that the PrimeMinister&apos;s reply might refer to this.The Cabinet were informed that the question was likely to be raised in the House of Lordsby Lord Carson next Wednesday,The reply to the Question was leftto the Prime Minister^ after con-sultation with the Chief Whip.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(28)Conclusion 8.
8. The Home Secretary consulted the Cabinebas to whether the House of Commons should beallowed a free vote on the question of raisingto 85,  instead of 21, the age at which the franchise should be exercisable by both sexes .The Cabinet agreed  That, in the present stage ofthe controversy, it would notbe in the public interest toallow a free vote.The Home Secretary also consulted theCabinet in regard to the question of election expenses, on which he reported a good deal ofdivision of opinion among Members of the Hotiseof Commons .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Home Secretary should speak comparatively early inthe Debate, in order to givethe House of Commons a lead,H.e was asked to take the line that the Government sympathisedwith those who wished to reducethe cost of Elections, but that until experience was gained bya General Election held underthe new suffrage the data werenot available for judging asto whether an alteration in thepresent system was desirable ornot.    It was true that theenlargement of the electorateautomatically increased theamount to be spent, but it also made it much more difficult forcandidates to reach electors bythe ordinary means-,    For example,it had been calculated that onlya small proportion of the elector-ate could in future be appealed to by means of public meetings,so that other methods had to befound.   He might further pointout that Members were not boundto spend the whole of the amountallowed.    If the next GeneralElection should show an altera-tion in the scale of expenses tobe desirable,, this could easily be effected by amending theexisting legislation:(b) That the Secretary of State for war should be prepared to take part inthe Debate at a later stage, ifnecessary.
bjr Resides ein*elusion 5.)on the subject of Avoidance of Taxation byResidence in the Channel Islands .(previous reference: In these Memoranda it was reported thatrjsbinet 6&amp;;G7), Con-^ negotiations with the Channel Islands authorities had reached a successful conclusion, which was announced by the Financial Secretary to theTreasury in the House of Commons on July 21,1927.    In the source of the negotiations, however,the Channel Islands authorities had stipulated that the necessary legislation in Great Britainimposing the taxation required should be general in its terms, covering all British Dominionsand not specifically directed to the channel islands.   The various drafts of legislationdevised to meet this stipulation, which are attached to Paper C.P.-123 (23)), had beenobjected to by the Dominions Office on Constitu-tional grounds, and   as    likely to arouseobjeotiens in the Dominions.After come discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should explain to the Governments of theDominions the Importance whichwas attached by the House ofCommons to the prevention of tax avoidance in the channel islands, and should do his utmost to induce them to consent to the methods now under consid-eration:(b) That the Chancellor of theExchequer should inform theHouse of Commons that, in viewof the necessity to consult theDominions,  it had not been found possible to make provision in theBudget for 1928-29 for preventing0j (HANKEIi 3.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum and cable companies. by the Secretary of State for Scotland, as chairman of the Imperial Wireless and Cable(Previous , .Reference: Conference (Paper C.P.-126 (28)) in which itCabinet 15(28), Con- was stated that, after considering a Report byelusion 1.)Sir Otto Niemeyer and Sir William McLintock onthe financial aspect of the merger between theEastern Telegraph and Marconi Companies, therepresentatives on the Imperial Conference ofthe Governments of the Dominions and India were unanimously in favour of entering into anarrangement with the merged Company which would include the sale (if possible, and, if not, theleasing)  of the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s system and the Imperial Atlantic Cables, and theleasing of the General Post Office Beam installa-tions to the merged Company.    Sir John Gilmour,in his Memorandum, pointed out that an arrange-ment of this nature involved a departure fromthe policy hitherto pursued, by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britain in regard to theretention of the Beam Services in this countryin Government hands .    If the original policy wasto be adhered to, however, no further progress could be made, and the breakdown of the Confer-ence was likely.After hearing statements in support of theSecretary of State for Scotland&apos;s proposals  fromthe Secretary of State himself and the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury, as well as a statement on the other side by the Postmaster-General, who,besides being unwilling in prinoiple to acceptthe proposal to grant a lease of the Beam. wireless services to a merger Company, urged most strongly
that on no account should the Government part with control over Imperial Wireless Telephony,and after considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed -(a) That the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland(Paper CP.-126 (28)) should bereferred for consideration andreport to the Cabinet Committeeappointed on February 15, 1928(Cabinet 7 (28), Conclusion 3):(b) That the Secretary of State forAir should be added to the above committee, the membership of whichwould therefore be composed as follows the Secretary of State for Scotland(in the Chair),The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The President of the Board of Trade,The Postmaster-General,The Financial Secretary to theTreasury.(NOTE.

The Cabinet took act of a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (paper c.P.-1I8 (28)) reporting that, in accordancewith the Cabinet Conclusion mentioned in the margin, Sir Austen Chamberlain, having aacer-tained that Sir G, Clayton adhered to. theopinion previously expressed that his utilityas a negotiator would be seriously prejudiced by a decision to hold up in this country the munitions already ordered by Ibn Saud, had instructed the Foreign Office to inform theother Government Departments concerned that inhis opinion the Cabinet decision should begiven effect to forthwith and the munitionsallowed to proceed, on the understanding thatthe ship called at Port Sudan where, in caseof need, the munitions could be held up.The Secretary of State for Air reportedthat since the last Meeting of the Cabinet hehad ascertained that the ship conveying the ammunition to Ibn Saud was due at Port Sudanabout the end of the month, whereas Sir GilbertClayton could not arrive at Jeddah before the3rd. or 4th. of May,    He therefore wished to consult his colleagues on the two followingpoints(i) Having regard to the fact that sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s negotia-tions might occupy some weeks,hew long was the ammunition tobe held up at Port Sudan?(ii) Was he authorised to pay a moderatesum in compensation to the firminvolved in the shipment, whichwould otherwise be out of pocketowing to the Cabinet&apos;s decision?
U 1 4After hearing from Mr Oliphant, of theForeign Office, the views of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, the Cahinet, while recognising the importance of not hamperingSir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s negotiations,  felt thatthe ammunition should not he allowed to proceeduntil it was known whether the negotiations were to result in peace or war.    They therefore decided  (a) That the Secretary of State forAir should arrange that the ammunition should not leavePort Sudan until afterSir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s views had been received from Jeddah.Any detention at Port Sudanshould be as unostentatious aspossible.    For example, it mightwell result from the delaysinseparable from transhipment;(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affaire should instructwhether he considered that the ammunition should be sent on atonce or not:That the Secretary of State forAir should be authorised to pay compensation to the shippers forany unavoidable delays .

Theseproposals included a request from the british broadcasting Corporation for permission to broadcast the Service at the Cenotaph onArmistice Day,   They wished to make a trial oftheir arrangements by broadcasting the british legion Service on Whit Mon&amp;aff , and this was thereason why the question had been raised at thiscomparatively early date.The First Lord of the Admiralty stronglydeprecated the proposal to broadcast the service at the Cenotaph.    The Cabinet were informed,however, that there was very strong pressure from public opinion in favour of broadcastingthis ceremony, and that one of the main objec-tions, as explained in the Home Secretary&apos;sMemorandum., was now no longer applicable.The Cabinet agreedThat the opinion of the king should be taken by the HomeSecretary before any definiterecommendations are submitted,but that,  subject to this, theHome Secretary should make theKing aware informally that theview of the Cabinet was in favourof his proposals   which may besummarised as folios:-(a) Permission should be granted for broadcasting the service at the Cenotaph on Armistice day:(b) Notwithstanding that Armistice day will fall on a Sunday, themain ceremony should take place at the Cenotaph on the usuallines, with a special service in Westminster Abbey, attended,as in ordinary years, byrepresentative Service Detach-ments:
(c) That, in due course., the HomeSecretary should consult the archbishop of Canterbury witha view to arrangements beingmade for Church Servicesthroughout the country to commence at 10-45 aam. or at such other earlier hotir as maybe convenient,  instead of 11 a,m.-IS-
