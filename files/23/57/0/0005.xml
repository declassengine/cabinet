THE KINGT SSPEECH.(previous reference:Cabinet 4(88), Con-clusion 6.)1. The Cabinet had before them   the second draftof the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament(Paper C.P.-S1 (28)).The Cabinet approved the draft(Appendix) for submission tothe King.
2.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Reduction of  Expenditurein 1928:-A Most Secret Note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer  (Paper CP. 323  (27))prepared in accordance with Cabinet62  (27)  Conclusion 3(b), containing a summary of a scheme for reducing:expenditure,  etc., and avoiding new-taxation, which he wished to be con-sidered by his  colleagues:A Most Secret Note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer containing theresults of the efforts of departments to achieve the programme of savingsproposed in the above Note  (paper cp. 20  (2P ) ) .The Chancellor of the Excheqiaer,  in thecourse of a  statement to the Cabinet,  alludedto some smaller economies  (e.g.,  from theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries) whichhad been promised.      He pointed out, however, thatthe Keneral position was that,  towards a deficit of  11,000,000, economies of only a littleover  6,000,000 had been promised.      Conseouently,in spite of an unexpected saving of nearly 1,200,000 on the Post Office Estimates, he was still nearly  5,000,000 short of the minimum which would enable the Budget to be balancedwithout extra taxation.The Admiralty had,  so far,  offered no contribution,  apart from any economy which might result from the Inquiry by the Cabinet naval programme Committee into the question of oil fuel Supplies.      In the absence of the First lord the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not wish todiscuss the question of Naval economies withthe Cabinet.      He hoped, however, to have someconversations on -the subject with the First LordREDUCTIONOF national expenditure.(previous references:Cabinet 62(27),  Con-elusion 3,and cabinet 3(28),  Con-clusion 3.)
of the Admiralty and his officials, and if therewere any points in dispute he would &quot;bring themto the Cabinet.Mr Churchill also hoped to have conversa-tions with the Minister of Health in regard tothe possibility of some further economies inthat Department.For the moment, however, he would only ask the Cabinet to consider the question of theChinese Boxer Indemnity.NOTE.The Secretary of the Cabinet isinformed that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Ministerof Health have agreed that the estate Duty Grant to the local taxation Account should be basedon the average of the last fiveyears and should not have retro-spective effect, thus reducingthe possible saving from  1,100-, OOoto  500,000.
J 0THE BOXER 3. The Cabinet had before them the followingINDEMNITY.documents relating to the Chinese Boxer indemnity-(Previous nity:-Reference:Cabinet 61 A Note by the Chancellor of the(27), Con- Exchequer (Paper C.P.-18 (28))elusion 11.) covering a Memorandum by theTreasury suggesting that there wasample justification for paying, overto the Exchequer the whole of the 2,000,000   accumulated from theBoxer Indemnity now lying unused,as well as the-further payments of  400,000 a year so long as the china Defence Force has to beretained:A Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper C.P.-24 (28))  covering Memoranda bythe Foreign Office and the right on. The Earl Buxton, Chairman ofthe Indemnity Advisory Committee,and other Papers, resisting theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;proposal:A Note by the Acting Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper C.P.-25 (28))  covering a letter from theGovernor of Hong-Kong and proposing that- a part of the already accumulatedBoxer Indemnity funds, namely, 1,404,000, be made available forthe development of Hong-Kong University.After the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had made statements from their respective points ofview,, it became clear that the pros and cons ofthe decision to be reached were vary evenly balanced,,   Prom the financial point of view itwas felt to be hard on the heavily-burdenedBritish taxpayer that the considerable fundsaccumulated from, the Boxer indemnity could notbe appropriated to the cost of the ShanghaiDefence Force, seeing that the necessity forthat force had arisen solely owing to thecontinued disorder; in China, and that it was due to these disorders that the said indemnity
could not be expended,  as intended, for thabenefit of the Chinese.    On the other hand the Cabinet were deeply impressed by the con-census of expert    views   as to the bad effects on Chinese and international opinion whichwould result from the appropriation of thesefunds to the maintenance of the Shanghai defence force.    It was felt that this would be parti-cularly inadvisable at a moment when Communism -was being overthrown in China, accompanied by a progressive disappearance of the anti-Britishsentiments which had formerly prevailed.    Inthis connection the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs warned the Cabinet that to use the funds as proposed would probably re-create the anti-British sentiments and involve anirreparable breach with China.The Cabinet decided that, in viewof the difficulty of the question,the discussion should be adjourned until the financial position was more clear, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer undertook to submitsuggestions for raising an equiva-lent sum by further economies.
HOUSE CPLORDSREFORM.(previous cms reference:Cabinet 4(28), Con-clusion 9.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theLord Chancellor containing proposals on thesubject of House of Lords Reform (Paper G.P.-19(28)).The Cabinet realised that, in view of thedecision taken on the previous day to aim atprorogation not later than the beginning ofAugust, it would be impossible to pass any considerable measure for the reform of theHouse of Lords in the present Session.   Underthis plan there would be time to pass a measure in the next Session of Parliament.    Moreover,the question was felt to require further explora-tion before final decisions were taken.The Cabinet agreed --That the Prime Minister should consult the Acting Chief Whipand other persons well versedin the political aspects of thequestion, with a view to a dis-casaion a little later on at aSpecial Meeting of the Cabinet *o     *     o2, Whitehall Gardens,.S.W.1,February 2, 1928
APPENDIX.Draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.Pebbuary 7, 1928.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly. It is the constant effort of My Government, in co-operation with the League of Nations,to secure the settlement of international differences and to promote the causeof peace.I have invited the King of Afghanistan to visit. Me in March and I look forward to welcoming His Majesty to My capital. It will be a particularpleasure to Me to receive His Majesty on his first visit to Europe.The position in China has so far improved as to permit large reductions inthe naval and military forces sent to the Par East for the protection of MyBritish and Indian subjects resident in the Concessions, but the situation causedby internal disturbances and civil wars and the consequent insecurity of life and property, both Chinese and foreign, still give cause for anxiety. In spiteof these discouraging circumstances, My Government adhere to the declarationof policy published by them a year ago, as the basis on which they are preparedto meet Chinese aspirations when the Chinese can assure satisfactory protection for British lives and property.On the 29th December last the United States Government communicatedto My Ambassador at Washington, for consideration and as a basis for negotiation, the draft of a new Treaty of Arbitration between Myself and thePresident of the United States of America, to take the place of the Treaty ofArbitration concluded at Washington on the 4th April, 1908. The terms ofthe new draft are being carefully and sympathetically studied by My Governmentin Great Britain and will be considered in communication with My governments in the Dominions.Members of the House of Commons,The Estimates for the Public Services will be laid before you in due course.My Lords and Membebs of the House of Commons,Although the condition of affairs in some of the principal industriescontinues to give cause for serious anxiety, I am glad to observe that in thegeneral state of trade and industry there are many encouraging signs ofprogressive improvement in both our home and external trade which justifythe hope that with co-operation and good-will steady progress will be made inthe coming year.The burdens&apos; imposed upon industry and agriculture by the presentincidence of local rates have attracted the anxious attention of My Ministers.They are now engaged upon inquiries into the possibility of affording somerelief from these burdens to the producing community and into the changes in local government which would thereby be involved.Proposals will be brought before you for amending the law relating to theparliamentary and local government franchise.(1714S)
Measures will be presented to you for giving effect to certain recommendations of My Commission on National Health Insurance, and for increasing the credit facilities of persons engaged in agriculture.Among other Bills which you will be invited to pass are measures dealingwith the laws relating to the Supreme Court of Judicature and to Arbitration,with the amendment of the Companies Acts, with the valuation for ratingpurposes of property in London, and with the law relating to the MetropolitanCommon Poor Fund.You will also be asked to consider proposals for the reorganisation ofcertain of the Departments in Scotland.Bills dealing with other measures of importance will be introduced andproceeded with as time and opportunity allow.I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.February 1, 1928.
