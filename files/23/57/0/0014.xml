1. The Cabinet had before there a draft telegraito Lord Lloyd, circulated by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs  (Paper CP.-78 (28)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that he had circulated the draft telegram as it had been suggested to him by oneof his colleagues that he should bring the matter before the Cabinet before final instructions were sent to Lord Lloyd.The Lord Privy Seal, who, owing to indispo-sition, had boen unable to attend the meetingseither of the Cabinet Committee or of the cabinet at which the draft Treaty had been approved,informed his colleagues that he had always feltsomewhat apprehensive of the proposal to entrusteventually to the League of Nations the decision as to where the British garrison should be stationed in Egypt.   The British G-overnment hadnot been prepared hitherto to accept the principleof compulsory arbitration^ and in a matter sovital to cur Imperial communications as the location of the British garrison in Egypt he had felt that the decision ought not to be entrusted to the League of Nations, who were not equipped with the necessary knowledge on such matters asthe requirements of our safety, our relationswith Eastern Powers, and so forth, to decidesuch a question.    Lord Salisbury was reminded that the question had been discussed in great detail before the decision had been taken.There had been general agreement that thequestion of whether we were entitled to main-tain a garrison in Egypt for the maintenance ofour Imperial communications was one which could
not be left to the League, but the actual location of the garrison was felt to be one which could safely be left to the League, more especially as the interest of other Powers in the securityof their nationals in Cairo was likely to be similar to our own.There was general agreement that, once itwas clear that the Treaty had been finally rejected by the Egyptians, we ought to be entirely free from any obligation to renew the offer or to holdit open indefinitely;    but the view expressed on the last page of the telegram,that it was a mistake immediately to withdraw the draft Treaty,was accepted.The draft telegram to Lord Lloyd(Paper C0P.-78&quot;(28)) (Appendix I)was approved.

The Cabinet discussed the attitude to betaken up in the forthcoming Debate on theZinovieff Letter arising out of the Report ofthe Civil Service Inquiry on the &quot;Francs&quot; case.The line to be taken up by the government representatives in the Debate,  in developing the intentions of the Cabinet as revealed at this discussion, was left to the Prirne Minister andhis colleagues in the House of Commons, with theaddition of the Secretary of State for India-3-
REDUCTION AND 3. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theLIMITATION OPAHMA-MBNTSe Lord Privy Seal (Paper O.Pa-79 (.28)) asking theCabinet to approve the draft telegram to Lord(previous reference: Oushendun drawn up and approved by the Cabinet-Cabinet 8(28) Con- Committee on Policy in regard to Reduction andelusion 3.)Limitation of Armaments.The Cabinet agreed - (a) To approve the draft telegram,subject to an amendment in thefirst paragraph to show that thedraft was approved by the Cabinet:and subject to the correction ofan error in the last sentence asto the position of the invertedcommas:A copy of the telegram as approved by the Cabinet isattached as Appendix IIe(b) That the Secretary to the cabinet should take steps to secure the circulation of a Memorandumforwarded by Lord Gushendunof a conversation he had held with Sir Austen Chamberlain atGeneva, which contained the record of an important convor-sation between the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs andM. Briand.
PALESTINE.The ProposedLoan.Zionism.(previous cms reference?Cabinet   46(26), Con-elusion 11.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council (Paper C.P.-71 (28))  on the question of assisting the zionist policy in Palestine by a loan negotiatedthrough the League of Nations or otherwise.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesexplained that through a misunderstanding, hisown Memorandum, prepared in concert with the earl of Balfourrs Memorandum, had not been circulated.   After expressing general agreement in the Earl of Balfour&apos;s point of view, and-aftermentioning one or two points in which he thoughtLord Balfour had not quite done justice to theaction of the British and Palestine Governments,Mr Amery explained that the Zionist Organisation,which had done so much for Palestine, now feltthat it would make a great difference towards asettled policy if a capital fund could be estab-llshed for the purpose of forwarding the Zionistpolicy in that country, and it was hoped thatthi3 object could be accomplished by means of a loan guaranteed by the League of Nations.   Thematter was of some urgency as Dr. Weizmann wasleaving this week for America and hoped to have some indication of the Cabinet&apos;s policy beforesailing.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the League of Nations did not,so far as he knew, guarantee loans.    It was truethat loans had been issued with the approval ofthe League of Nations, but that would involve acertain amount of control by the League over thefinance of Palestine.XfJts  w?* a   pu**,Hv^ Soau*.   k,   Pa (it &quot;A*ul ( A
The Cabinet felt that they had not beforethem a sufficiently definite proposal to enablethem to express any opinion.T he Secretary of State for the Colonieswas asked to circulate his Memorandum before thenext Meeting of the Cabinet and to state thereinprecisely what the proposal was to which theCabinet were asked to agree.
FOREIGN capital and BRITISHENTERPRISE.ElectricalDevelopmentand AmericanCapital.(previous reference:Cabinet 8(86), Con-elusion 15.)^ 0 o5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (Paper C.P.-77 (28))in regard to the extent to which Americanfinanciers are interesting themselves in theacquisition of electrical undertakings in thiscountry.In this Memorandum the suggestion was made that the matter should be referred to the Committeeof Civil Research.The Cabinet approved in principle that thequestion of the Investment of foreign capital inBritish enterprise, and the extent to which itwould result in foreign control of vital national interests, should be referred to the Committee ofCivil Research, and that the Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation with the President ofthe Board of Trade, should be asked to advise the Prime Minister as to the Terms of reference and the composition of the Inquiry.
PITTING.The racecourse betting Bill.The Totaiisator(previous reference:Cabinet 13(28), Con-clusion 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Home Secretary (Paper C.P.-75 (28))  onthe subject of the Racecourse Betting Bill,urging that if the Eill obtains a Second Readingan amendment should be moved by the Governmentdeleting the provision limiting the scope&apos; of theBill to races under the auspices of the JockeyClub and the National Hunt Committee, andexpressing the hope that some indication mightbe given during the Second Reading Debate thatsuch an amendment would be moved by the Govern-ment in Standing Committee if the Bill is given a Second Reading.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) That no action should be taken until after the result of the debate on the Second reading of the Racecourse Betting bill was known:(b) That If trie Second Reading ofthe Bill was passed, the HomeSecretary should Invite someof the legal authorities in theCabinet and in the government service to join him in an inquiry into the matters raised in paper c.P.,-75 (28)) .

In thisMemorandum the Minister of Health submitted thata measure of disfranchisement of paupers so faras Guardians&apos; elections are concerned, and with due provision for the protection of cases of suchreal misfortune as disability by mental or physicalsickesss, was urgently required.As the Memorandum had been circulated onlylate on the previous evening and members of theCabinet had not had time to read it, the subject was adjourned until the following week, when theSecretary was asked to remind the Prime Ministerto place it early on the Agenda Paper.

APPENDIX      I.21SECRET.CP. 78   (28) .DRAFT TELEGRAM TO LORD LLOYD.Your telegram Ho*. 156   (of 9th inarch) .I agree generally with your suggestions.Modification of the electoral law may very probablyprove inevitable.      Such a modification might conceivably be of advantage both to Egypt,  as making more possible some improvement in the standard of administration,  and to HisMajesty&apos;s Government,  as promoting the chance of the treaty&apos;seventual acceptance.      You will recollect, however,  that inthe note conveying the declaration of February 1922 to the sultan it was laid down that &quot;the creation of a parliament with a right to control the policy and administration of aconstitutionally responsible government is a matter for your Highness and the Egyptian people to determine&quot;.      Thisformal  disavow&amp;l on our part of responsibility may prove tohave both advantages and disadvantages at the present justice.      But the fact remains that we shall be attackedas responsible for whatever constitutional changes may takeplace,  and I share your view that great circumspection onour part is called for.      It is important,   therefore,  thatas little open and direct responsibility shall be incurredas is possible in the   circumstances.I further agree generally with your outline of policy towards any government which succeeds Sarwafs.      You are  -of course right in wishing that issue should be joined withthem upon matters which not only fall within the scope ofthe declaration of 1922,  but so affect foreign interests asto make us the champion and secure us the good will of1.
foreign powers. Of these the first is the maintenance oflaw and order, and the protection of life and property andit is here that we could best take our stand.With regard to more purely British interests greatcaution will be necessary.      The maintenance of the LondonOffice, for instance,  is comparatively a detail and wecannot have it said that we had acquiesced in the suppression of Egypt&apos;s Constitution merely for the sake of promoting British Commercial interests.      Questions of this nature can I think be best settled after major issues havebeen dealt with.      The Egyptian State Railways,  again, affordlittle justification for drastic intervention at present.The question of officers in the Frontier DistrictsAdministration more nearly fulfills the necessary conditionbut is not as clear or overwhelming a case as I should wish.Deterioration in the ports and lights administration,  on theother hand,  in so far as it causes a clear danger to international shipping, would, afford solid ground forremonstrance.    I observe, moreover,  that you make no referenceto the 1855 loan.      Here,  intervention on our part now seemswarranted,  seeing that we have a good case in equity;    sincethe British taxpayer is now bearing the burden of Egypt&apos;sfailure to meet the obligation.      Moreover Sarwat Pashaassured me more than once that this question should be settledshortly.      But perhaps the most favourable ground forintervention on behalf of our own interests would be afforded by Egyptian recalcitrance in the matter of our air communications,  if and when it is displayed.      I do not think,however,  that it is possible to do more than give you these general indications of my views at this moment,  since so muchmust depend upon the circumstances of the moment.I agree with you that,  taking the long view,  it would
be wiser not to oppose the assumption of office by I a purelyWafd Ministry,  although I appreciate the risks to which youdraw attention.      A &quot;mixed&quot;  or wholly non-Wafd governmentwould be less convenient, but I see no reason why our attitude should be modified by the political complexion,or the lack of it, of the incoming Ministry.      In any event,I agree that it would be undesirable to address to them anywarning beyond that already given which was designed to accordyou as free a hand as possible.      The foregoing paragraphwould not of course apply were Sidky, for example, to come forward with an offer to form a government which would seethe treaty through.      This would create a new situationrequiring consideration on its merits.As to your own attitude in the immediate future,  I am inclined to think that one of reserve is the most suitable.The Egyptians have chosen to place themselves in their presentsituation,  and it is for them to get out of it as best theycan.      If the process involves dissensions and delay, we seemto stand to lose nothing,  while the Wafd&apos;s prestige would hardly be enhanced.      In the absence of unexpecteddevelopments,  therefore, you would do well to stand aside,and avoid committing yourself to advising King Fuad to adoptany particular course.      This,   I gather,  is your own view andI am in complete agreement with it.As regards the treaty His Majesty&apos;s Government made amost generous offer of settlement.      The Prime Minister ofEgypt saw in it a great opportunity for his country.      Hisgovernment however refused it as he himself has explained atthe bidding of the Wafd.      In all probability therefore it isdead because those who without responsibility for theresults of their action have imposed their will on the Cabinetwhich was nominally responsible for Egyptian policy have
IGN OFFICE,I12th March,  I928 .obliged that Cabinet to reject it on the ground it does not provide for the complete withdrawal of the British forces from egypt.      This is a condition which was refused by the lateBritish Government and which no British Government will orcan accept.        The treaty stands as the high water mark ofBritish concession to Egyptian nationality and the contrastbetween the generosity of its terms and the character of itsreception by the Egyptian parliamentary majority is one whichpatriotic Egyptians may well be left to ponder.      It is notto be assumed in the light of this new experience and the lessons which it teaches that His Majesty&apos;s Government willrenew the offer or indefinitely hold it open but in our viowit would be a mistake immediately to withdraw it.      Let Egypthavo a little time for reflection before the Sibylline booksare burnt.      Let us keep the Egyptians guessing.
APPENDIX      IITo SWITZERLAND.Cypher telegram to Mr. London (Geneva)Foreign Office,  13 th March,  1928.      4o50 p.m.No.  14.IMMEDIATE.Following for Lord Cushendun.Cabinet Committee have considered position inregard to forthcoming discussions of PreparatoryCommission and have submitted proposals to Cabinet,also have approved them in the following form.With regard to Russian proposals M. Briand&apos;suggestion is approved,  viz:    that proposals should bsubjected at outset to searching questions such as are they calculated to prevent not only war between nations but also civil war the instigation of whichhas hitherto been avowed object of Soviet government.In supporting french attitude we leave a great deal to your discretion but in regard to these questionsyou. will of course be careful to avoid using anylanguage which might be construed into implying thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government was obstructing reductionin armaments so as to be able to suppress legitimatelabour movement..      Russian proposals should then bereferred to special committee for examination and repas suggested in your memorandum W/2173/28/98 ofMarch 3rd.      Adjournment of Preparatory commission is desirable,  but British responsibility for seekingsuch adjournment should if possible be avoided.-Interval between adjournment and next meeting of
preparatory Commission should be utilised to forward the compromise between Franco and ourselves in regardto land and sea armaments as outlined in conversation between Sir Austen Chamberlain and M. Briand, i.e.support of France to our naval proposals as stated inSection II of Admiralty memorandum Ho. P.R.A.  (27)23 Revise, to Toe secured by withdrawal of openresistance on our part to French views on army reserve.      Having regard to events of last year, how-ever, it is very important that open discussions oncruiser questions should if possible to postponed tillafter American Presidential election.     The present occasion should not be lost for publicly putting forward British Admiralty&apos;s proposals in regard to capital ships since having regard to public opinionat home and abroad tho value of seising the initiativeon this proposal outweighs any risk of displeasingAmericans, and ultimately no report on reduction ofnaval armaments would be complete without it.     Oncecase has been placed before the public as a British proposal actual date of consideration is not ofmaterial importance, provided agreement is reached in such time as will enable proposals to become effective before Washington Treaty expires.      In viewtherefore of American objection discussion as to this date should at the present moment be avoided.If either French or Italians suggest that the ratio allotted to them under the Washington Treaty ...is too low, Admiralty entertain no objection to their -.\ii\\
ratio being raised from 1.7 to Any suggestionhowever of this kind must of course emanate from them and not be put forward by   /you.The submission to the League of a model state-mo nt of expenditure on armaments Is agreed to generally in the form proposed by the committee of experts.But it should be preceded by a sentence as follows&quot;This form is to be used only for the comparison of one 3^ear&apos;s expenditure with another of each particular country.      It cannot be used for thepurpose of comparing the military, naval and airstrengths of different countries&quot;.      Besides thiscertain minor technical amendments are being studiedand it is possible we may send them to you if thereis still time.
