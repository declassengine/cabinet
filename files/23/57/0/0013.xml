In these circumstances the Government of India saw no reason why theyshould accept any liability to the Company, toits staff or to the Directors.   There did not seem the slightest prospect that the IndianLegislature would sanction compensation, nor could the Government of India find any argumentswherewith to support it.In the course of the discussion thesuggestion was made that one solution wouldbe to say frankly to the House of Lords, aswell as to the Basel Trading Company, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared toput pressure on India, and to suggest that theCompany should approach the Government ofIndia direct.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of the BaselTrading Company should bereferred to a -Cabinet Com-mittee composed as follows -The Lord Privy Seal   (In the Chair)The Chancellor of the Exchequer(who said he would probably have to be represented byMr Upcott, of the Treasury),The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for India,The Attorney-General,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary,Foreign Office.(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should draft,in the strongest possible manner,the arguments which might appealto the Government of India inregard to compensation to theInterests concerned, and should communicate them to the Secretaryof State for India, who undertook to telegraph them to the Governmentof India and to state that theyhad made a favourable impressionupon the Cabinet.
