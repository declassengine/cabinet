THE LORDCHANCELLOR.(previous oiisReference:Cabinet SI(23), Con-elusion 2.)1.   The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that, to his great regret, Lord Cave had resignedthe office of Lord Chancellor on grounds ofill-health.   The Attorney-General had acceptedthe vacancy caused by the Lord Chancellor1sresignation.    The present Solicitor-General(Sir Thomas Inskip) had accepted to becomeAttorney-General but would not be a member ofthe Cabinet.   Mr P.B. Merriman, K.C., had accepted the post of Solicitor-General.   Theabove appointments had received the King*assent. (See also Conclusion 8g)At the request of his colleagues thePrime Minister undertook to write to Lord Cavean expression of their deep regret and sympathy.
AFGHANISTAN.        1 S-* -The- Sec ret ary- of--State fox Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had had a conversa-(previous previous reference: tion with King Amanullah and another with his cabinet 11(28), Con- Foreign Secretary.   He had learned fromelusion 4.)reliable sources that the King&apos;s visit to thiscountry had made a great impression on   KingAmanullah himself and on his entourage, with,perhaps, one exception.    In the course of an hour&apos;s conversation the Afghan Foreign minister had ashed for trade facilities:    the trainingof Afghan Officers, which Sir Austen Chamberlainhad undertaken to give:    assistance in the formof munitions, in regard to which Sir austen chamberlain had warned him of the world opinion and the strong British opinion in favour of disarmament, but,, subject to that, had expressedthe hope of rendering some assistance;    andhad handed in proposals regarding a State Bankwhich were under examination by the Treasury.The Secretary of State informed the Cabinetthat he was about to circulate a Memorandumon his interview.
IRAQ,.The AkhwanRaids.(previous eusReference:Cabinet 13(28), Con-concluslon 5.)3. The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that the principal danger in the present situation between Iraq andIbn Saud was that King Peisal might encourageretaliation among his people.   He thought,however, that Sir Henry Dobbs had the situationwell in hand, and a British representative also had the frontier Tribes well under control.Mr Amery*s impression was that Ibn Saud had**tear to discotfrage raids.   For example, oneraid which had assembled on the Trans J ordaniaside had fallen back, apparently as the resultof Ibn Saud&apos;s efforts.   The present difficulty was to establish contact with Ibn Saud.   TheBritish Resident in the Persian Gulf was underthe impression that Ibn Saud was approachingthat side and wished to have an Interview withhim himself, but the Colonial Office were endeavouring, in accordance with the wishes ofthe Cabinet, to arrange that Sir Gilbert Claytonshould meet Ibn Saud.The Secretary of State for Air reportedthat no raid had taken place since February,which was regarded by the Air Officer commanding in Iraq as reassuring.   He felt it was of greatimportance, if Ibn Saud was found to be in a friendly frame of mind, to make peace as soonas possible, and our emissary, whoever he was,should know exactly what was intended.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsurged that the instructions to our emissaryshould be considered, and that,before negotia-tions were allowed to break down on such aquestion as the establishment of frontier forts,the Cabinet should be given an opportunity for
discussion.This view met with general support fromthe Cabinet.
Li-lbADEN. 4.   The Secretary of State for the Coloniesrecalled that a few weeks ago the Imam of thePreviousReference: Yemen had made an aggression against the AdenCabinet 52(27), Con- Protectorate and had kidnapped two Sheikhs,elusion 9(b) .)In consequence it had been necessary (in accord-ance with the Cabinet decision on December 1,1926 (Cabinet 61 (26) Conclusion 6), to retaliate, and the Royal Air Force had bombed the Imam&apos;s troops intermittently.   The result was that the Imam had now climbed down, had sent back the captured Chiefs, and was suingfor a truce and asking for discussions.Trie Secretary of State for Air urged thatit was most important to make peace in this region while the opportunity was open, and he hoped that no time would be lost in decidinghow much of the Aden Protectorate it wasnecessary to insist on.The Cabinet concurred in this view and expressed satisfaction at this further vlndica-tion of the policy of using the Royal AirForce against Native forces.
CHINA.Withdrawalof Forces.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 15(88), Con-elusion 2.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Nanking negotiations had broken down, but apparently on a very narrowis sue.   He was accordingly trying to save thesituation, and was in communication with SirMiles Lampson on the subject.In the meantime a telegram had beenreceived from the Naval Commander-in-chief(No.979, dated March 25th) pointing out thatthe failure to reach a settlement over theNanking incident was likely to result inviolent repercussions all over China, especiallyin the Yangtse Valley, and expressing the view(i)  that in consequence the departure of theThird Destroyer Flotilla in April was inadvis-able;  (ii) that any further reduction of the china Fleet or the Shanghai Defence Force was out of the question&quot;, and (iii) that it wasnecessary to retain the guard on shore at nanking.The Cabinet agreed  That, notwithstanding the authority given by the Cabinet regarding thereduction of forces in Ohina, theNaval Commander-in-Chief shouldhave discretion (subject to theconcurrence of the British Ministerat Peking and, in the case of thegarrison at Nanking or other land forces, of the General OfficerCommandlng-in-Chief) to retain anylorces destined for withdrawalwhich he deemed necessary for the fulfilment of his responsibilities.
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments .(previous onsReferenc e&apos;.Cabinet 15(g8), Con-conclusion 4.)6,,   The Prime Minister, on behalf of theCabinet, congratulated the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster (Lord Cushendun) on hissuccessful conduct of the negotiations atGeneva in connection with the Security and limitation of Armaments Committees.

latter are matured, but should wait until theIndustrial transfers erenea Board7 s schemes arebefore them and then proceed, after due cons id-era ti on, to frame their own proposals.The Cabinet heard statements from theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs andlord Lo:/at.After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed  That Mr Somerville and the otherPromoters of his Bill should beinformed that the industrial transference board Report was expected shortly, and that untilthat Report had been received and considered the Governmentcould in no way advance uponthe decision previously announced to them.

The amendments to Clause 4of the Bill have the effect of abolishing the penalty for all other military offences .The Cabinet were informed that all theService Departments were agreed on this Bill.The First Lord of the Admiralty statedthat, if there was any desire for an amendmentof the Navy Discipline Act, he was prepared toIntroduce a Bill to that effect at short notice,and he anticipated no difficulty in passing it.Until that was done there would be a slightdiscrepancy between the law of the death penalty for the Navy, on the one hand, and theArmy and Air Force on the other.The Cabinet approved the Army andAir Force (Annual) Bill in the formattached to Paper C.P.-99 (28).
