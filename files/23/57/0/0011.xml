he- Tha Cabinet bad before them a MeascranCum(Paper CaP0-S9 (28)) by the Secretary of Statefor India,  covering a telegram from the viceroy of India and raising three questions colored bythe Cabinet decisions of December 22nd on theIndlanisation of the Indian Army.   The first question related to the stage at which theproposed change in the form of Commission shouldbe given effect;    the second, to the announcementof a maximum number of vacancies at Woolwich;and the third, to the method of employing Indianswho succeed in passing out of Cranweli.In regard to the first point two questions were rai3&amp;d for consideration by the Secretary ofState, namely, (A), Would the Gabinet assent toa less restricted formula than that embodied intheir previous decision:    and (B), Would theyIn any ease agree to a postponement of the changeIn the form of Commission?       In regard to (A)Lord BIrkenhead suggested the following formula:-&quot;BIn these circumstances we see noobjection to an announcement thatthe government&apos;s policy contemplatesthat, as India progresses towardsfull self-government within theEmpire, there may be in process ofdevelopment an Army of the samecharacter as the Dominion Armiesorganised on a national basis anaofficered by Indians, provided thatit i3 definitely requiredw etce, as before.In regard to (B) Lord Birkenhead proposedthat the change in the form of Commission fi*cma King&apos;s Commission to a restricted Oommisslcrianalogous to that granted to Officers in the self-Governing Dominions, should be postponed.In regard to the second point, namely, thenumber of -vacancies at Woolwich, the Secretary
of State for India suggested in his memorandum that a statement might he made that the ArmyCouncil would he prepared to acoept Indians at woolwich up to a maximum of six a year.As regards Oranwell, the suggestion in theMemorandum was that the matter should be left tothe Secretary of State for India and the Secretaryof State for Air to agree on a solution thatconformed to the principles already laid down bythe Cabinet;    the Government of India to beinformed of their declaion, which should be reported to the Cabinet.The discussion at the Cabinet was confine!to the question of the form of Commission to begiven to Indian Officers.The Secretary of State for War informed the cabinet that he would not press that the changein the form of the Commission should be taken upnow.   He was, however, about to circulate a shortMemorandum in order to enter a caveat that thisquestion would have to be raised and settled atcome later date.   At present he would not press for any change in the form of Commission grantedto Indian Officers.

by the Memoranda circulated bythe Secretary of State for India,and that, in addition, an official of the India Office should be athis disposal for the purpose ofthese negotiations&apos;(c) That, while it was unnecessary toencourage the Ming of Afghanistanor his Minis tei-3 to apply for membership of the League ofNations, any proposal in thisdirection which might come fromthe Afghan side should be supported t(d) That the question of the establish&quot;merit of British Consuls in NorthernAfghanistan, involving consequentialthe establishment of Soviet RussianConsuls in Southern Afghanistan, onwhich the views of the indian government are at variance withthe recommendations of the Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence, should be leftto the decision of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs andthe Secretary of State for India:(e) That,  sublet to the above, theReport of the Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence onthe Defence of India, together withthe recommendations of the Committeeof Imperial Defence thereon (PaperOoPo-26 (28)), should be approved.
IRAQ,.Future ofthe Railways(previous reference:Cabinet 2(28), Con-clusion 2.)THE PROPOSEDIRAQ-haifa railway and pipeline.(previous o-as reference:Cabinet 57(27) , Corv-oInsIon 9e)5. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Future of the railways in Iraq:-A Memorandum circulated by the acting Secretary of State for theColonies (Paper CoP.-^SSI (27))suggesting that His Majesty&apos;government should s-ssist in there-conditioning and developmentof the Iraq railway system by providing s loan, subject to prior guarantee by the IraqGovernment0 la order to providethe necessary new capital forthis purpose, viae9  2,1Q090009A Memorandum. (Pacer 0ePc-^2 (28))by the Chancellor of the Exchoqaercovering a Treasury Memorandumard asking the Cabinet, as a matterof financial principle,  to reject the policy of the guaranteed loan,leaving the Treasury and ColonialOffice to settle the best methodof financing the Iraq railwayswithout violating this principle.The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that the question before them was closely connected with a still larger questionwhich he anticipated would in the near future come before the Cabinet, namely, that of the proposedpipeline and railway from Iraq to the MediterraneanThe latest discoveries of oil in Iraq were ooimportant that the Turkish Petroleum Company were contemplating a pipeline to the Mediterranean.The shortest line would be to a port in Frenchmandated territory on the Gulf of Alexandretta.It was, however, important, both from the Navaland Air points of view, that the line should, ifpossible, be brought into territory under british control.   The objections of some of the forejig.&quot;representatives on the Turkish Petroleum board would be overcome if a railway were to be builtsimultaneously with the pipeline from.Iraq tothe port    of Hv**Lfa0 In Palestine.   A British group
&quot;had such a railway in contemplation at the presenttime and h?.d employed General Manse, an engineerwell--known to the British Government, to make a preliminary survey.   There was little doubt thatformal proposals for the construction of this railway would be received in the near future.    Inthese circumstances the Secretary of State for theColonies offer d to withdraw for the time beinghis proposals on the future of the Iraq railways, bhe thought it would be advisable, even at thepresent stage, to set up a Cabinet Committee, whichcould be summoned to consider the larger questionof the railway and pipeline from Iraq to theMedit mediterranean.The Cabinet were informed that (during theabsence of the Secretary of State in the Dominioni)the Ministers at the head oi the Departmentsprimarily concerned (the Board of Trade,  theColonial Office, Air Ministry) had been in close consultation on the subject;    that those in chargeof the commercial interests in this matter hadbeen made aware of the reasons in favour of aBritish port, and that for the moment there wasno further action to be taken.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of the future ofthe Iraq Railways should be postponed for the pr:sentft. Ss&amp;uJ-c^ f) S**-&amp;. A. 7^L(b) That the Ministers in charge of theDepartments primarily concerned inthe important question of the proposedrailway and pipeline from Iraq to theMediterranean should keep in close touch on the subject.
^HE BASEL 6.    The Lord Privy Seal gave an account of aCO&amp;PANY&quot;. conversation he had hod the eame morning   with lord Templetown on the subject of the Basel(previous previous reference: Trading Company,  in the course of which LordCabinet 10(28) ? Con- Templetown   -had informed him that at the timeelusion 2.)when the property was sequestrated the BaselTrading Company had  540,;000 in liquid form.Of this the Colonial Office had already repaid 120,000 with interest.    If the Rouse of Lordscould be informed that the balance ( 22 0,000with interest) -would be returned to the BaselTrading Company Lord Temple town would not presshis Motion for a Select Committee for the presentand would leave the negotiations to continue.In the course of th.-! discussion the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies read a Note whichhad been pr-pared in the Colonial Office for 11 cuse of the Government spokesman on this subject in the House of Lords,    The Cabinet agreed that,this Note would be vary useful if Lord Templetownpressed the matter to a Debate, in which he was assured of considerable support from all parties in the House, but it was desirable, ifpossible, to avoid a Debate at the present justice.It was suggested to the Lord Privy Sealthat, in reply to Lord Temple townTs Question, heshould remind the House of Lords that when thequestion was last raised negotiations had beenin progress:    that since then the Basol TradingCompany had received their original capital( 120,000)  together with inte   st^. making atotal of  150,000 which had teen paid overt
that the Government had decided to hand back tothe Basel Trading Company their property;   butthat the question of whethers over and above therestitution here referred to, any further compon-sation should be given,, was in dispute, and thathe hoped the House of Lords would not embarrass the Government by a Debate^ which could onlyprejudice the negotiations.Another suggestion was that Lord Salisburyshould add that the terms to be offered to theBasel Trading Company would not be less generousthan those Which the Company had accepted fromthe French Government.The general view of the Cabinet was that,from the point of view of future negotiations,the shorter and the less commital the statement which the Lord Privy Seal found it necessary tomake, the better.The Secretary of State for India (who,having just returned from, a political engagementIn the country, had not had time to refresh hismemory&quot;on this question, which had not been onthe Agenda Paper of the Cabinet Meeting) undertook to inform the Lord Privy Seal as soon as possibleas to whether India could be counted on to return the sequestrated property to the Basel TradingCompany,Subject to the above, Lord Salisburywas asked to make the best case hecou^d on the subject the same after-noon in the House of Lords, and, ifpossible,  to avoid a DebateeLord Salisbury was authorised to base his statement on the followingnote drafted by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies-10-
Negotiations took placethroughout last Summer andAutumn on the basis of(a) restoration of their share capital plus interest:(b) restitution of their pro-perties:(c) some additional compensation.We were not able to arrive at asettlement of (c) but are willingto continue the negotiations.-10a-
