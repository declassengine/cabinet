The Cabinet had before there the following telegram from Sir Gilbert Clayton in regard tothe detention at Port Sudan of arms ordered byIbn Saud:-&quot;King only arrived at Jeddah today and oonversations open tomorrow.It must therefore be some days before I am in a position to makeany (? recommendation) and I maynot be able to conceal the factthat His MajestyTs Governmenthave caused delay in delivery,as ammunition is now at PortSudan.    In that case we mustface the effect which holding,up of ammunition by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may have on my comrersa-tions&quot;.    (Jeddah telegram No.55.dated 7th ifay. 1928.)After discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send thefollowing telegram to Sir Gilbert.

Howard&apos;s telegram of 3rd May (WashingtonNo.141) reporting that Mr Eellogg, while notsuggesting a Conference of Foreign Ministers,as it would be most inconvenient for him to leavenow and he did not really think it necessary,also did not wish it to be thought that herefused altogether to join in such a conferenceif Sir Austen Chamberlain thought it reallynecessary to get the Treaty through.    Mr Kellogg,however, did not like the idea of a preliminary conference of legal experts, and thought that since the German Note the negotiations had takenso favourable a turn th&apos; t they had better proceedthrough the ordinary diplomatic channels.C.P.-154 (28)).
Sir Austen Chamberlain also invited attention tohis reply of 8th Way (Nos. 195 and 19 6 to washington) thanking Mr Kellogg:    agreeing thatin no oase should a Conference he held untilthe matter had been   further prepared and agree-ment was practically in sight;    explaining thatit was with this object that his tentative proposal had been made for a conference of jurists which,following the successful Locarno precedent, mighthave done the preliminary work and brought the six Powers concerned within sight of, if not actually to, an agreement;    stating that on receiptof Mr Kellogg&apos;s views the suggestion had been withdrawn;    notifying Mr Kellogg that since thenSir Austen&apos;s attention had been devoted to obtain-ing the consent of the chief Continental Powerconcerned to an agreement satisfactory to theUnited States;    and adding in confidence that,while he could not speak definitely,  the prospectswere at present encouraging.Sir Austen Chamberlain described the courseof eonversations with the French Ambassador andM. Fromageot, the French Legal Adviser.    on saturday, May 5th, Sir William Tyrrell had impress-ed on the French Ambassador and M. Fromageotthe importance, from, the point of view of publicopinion here, of a substantial acceptance of theAmerican draft Treaty with necessary elucidations.This had been followed on   Sunday, May 6th, by a conversation between Sir Cecil Hurst and M.Fromageot;and on Monday, May 7th, M. de Fleurlau    and M.Fromageot, while not in a position to give adefinite answer, had undertaken to recommend theprocedureBritish   to the French Government.-g-

May 8.Your Excellency,Your note of April 13,  containing theThe American     text of a draft treaty for the renunciationAmbassador.,of war together with copies of the correspon-dence between the United States and french governments on the subject of this treaty,has been receiving sympathetic consideration at the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat Britain,     A note has also been re-ceived from the French Government, suggest-ing for consideration certain amendments to the text of the proposed treaty, andthe German Government were good enough tosend me a copy of the reply which has beenmade by them to the proposals of theUnited States Government *20   The suggestion for the conclusion ofa treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy has evokedwidespread interest in this country, and-His Majesty&apos;s Government will support themovement to the utmost of their power.3.   After making a careful study of the text contained in Your Excellency s noteAPPENDIX    I.UNITED STATES PROPOSALS FOR THE renunciation of WAR.DRAFT REPLY TO TEE UNITED STATES AMBASSADORSNOTE OF APRIL 13TH.
and of the amended text suggested in theFrench note, His Majesty1s Government feelconvinced that there is no serious diver-gence between the effect of these twodrafts.     This Impression Is confirmed by a study of the text of the speech by theSecretary of State of the United states to which Your Excellency drew my attention and which he delivered before the AmericanSociety of International Law on April 28th.The aim of the United States Government asI understand it is to embody in a treatya broad statement of principle,  to proclaimwithout restriction or qualification that war shall not be used as an instrument ofpolicy.      vvith this aim His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are wholly in accord.     TheFrench proposals, equally imbued with thesame purpose, have merely added an india a-tion of certain exceptional circumstances in which the violation of that principle by one party may oblige the others to take action seeming at first sight to be incon-sistent v.-ith the terms of the proposed pact.His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate thescruples which have prompted these sugges-ttons by the French Government.      The exactfulfilment of treaty engagements is amatter which affects the national honour?precision as to the scope of such engage-ments is, therefore, of importance.     Eachof the amendments suggested by the French/Government
Governmeat has been carefully considered fromthis p&amp;int of view.4.     After studying the wording of article of the United States draft, E.M. Gover&amp;mentdo not think that its terms exclude adtienwhich a state may he forced to take in self-defence.    Mr. Kellogg has made it clear inthe  speech to which I have referred above thathe regards the right of self-defence asinalienable, and His Majestyrs Government are disposed to think that on this question noaddition to the text is necessary.5. As regards the text of Article 2, no appreciable difference is found between thoAmerican and the French proposals.      H.M.Government are,  therefore, content to acceptthe former if as they understand to be thecase a dispute &quot;among tho High ContractingParties&quot; is a phrase wide enough to cover a dispute between any two of them.6, The French note suggests the additionof an article providing that violation of thotreaty by one of the parties should release the remainder from their obligations under thetreaty towards that party.      H.M. Governmentare not satisfied that,  if the treaty stoodalone,  the addition of some such provision would not be necessary.Mr.  KcllogTs/
Mr. Kellogg1 s speeoh however shows that he put forward for acoeptanoe the text of theproposed  treaty upon the understanding thatviolation of the undertaking by one party would free the remaining parties from theobligation to observe its terms in respectof the treaty-breaking state.7.      If it is agreed that this is theprinciple which will apply in the case of thisparticular treaty,  H.M. Government aresatisfied and will not ask for the insertion of any amendment.      Means can no doubt befound without difficulty of placing this understanding on record in some appropriatemanner so that it may have equal value withthe terms of the treaty itself.8.      The point is one of importancebecause of its bearing on the treatyengagements by which H.M. Government arealready bound.      The preservation of peacehas been the chief conoern of H.M. Governmentand the prime object of all their endeavours.It is the reason why they have given un-grudging support to the League of nations and why they have undertaken the burdenof the. guarantee embodied in the Locarno treaty.The
The sole object of ell these engagements isthe elimination of war as an instrument ofnational policy,  just as it Is the purposeof the peace pact now proposed.      It is because the object ox both is tho same thatthere is no real antagonism between thetreaty engagements which His majesty&apos;s government have already accepted and the pactwhich is now propoood.      The machinery oftho Covenant and of the Treaty of Locarno,however, go somewhat further than a morerenunciation of war as a policy, in thatthoy provide oertain sanctions for a breach of their obligations, and these sanctionsnay entail hostilities.      A ol ash might thus conceivably arise between the existingtreaties and the proposed pact unless it isunderstood that the obligations of the newengagement will coase to operate in respect ofa party which breaks its pledges and adoptshostile.measures against one of its co-contractants.9.    For the Government of this countryrespect for the obligations arising out of theCovenant of the League of Nations and out ofthe Locarno treaties is fundamental.      Ourposition in this regard is identical with&apos;thatof the German government as indicated in their note of April 27th.   H.M. Government could not agree to any new treaty which would weaken orundermine these engagements on which the peace of Europe rests.
Indeed public interest in this country inthe scrupulous fulfilment of these engagementsis do great that Eis Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould for their part prefer to seo some ouchprovision ae article 4 of the French draftembodied in the text of the treaty.    To this we think there can be no objection.   Mr.Kellogg has made it,clear in the speech townich I have drawn attention that he had no intention by the terms of the new treaty of preventing the parties to the Covenant of theLeague or to the Locarno treaty from fulfillingtheir obligations under those instruments.10.    The language of article 1, as tothe renunciation of war as an instrument ofnational policy,  renders it desirable that Ishould remind Your Excellency that there arecertain regions in close proximity to the linecof communication between the different parts ofthe British Empire whose welfare and integrityare necessary to the peace and safety of theEmpire.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have been atpains to make it clear in the past that theycannot suffer interference with these regions.Thoir protection against external attack is tothe British Empire a measure of self-defence.It must bo clearly understood that His Majesty rsGovernment in Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the distinct understanding that itdoes not prejudice thoir freedom of action inthis respect.       The Government of the UnitedStates...
States have striotly analagous interestsany disregard of which by a foreign Powerthey have declared that they would regard as an unfriendly aot.    His Majestyfs Govern-ment believe, therefore, that in definingtheir position they are expressing theintention and moaning of the U.3. government.11.      As regards the measure of participa-tion in the new treaty before it would comeinto force, H.M. Government agree that itis not necessar*y to wait until all thenations of the world have signified their willingness to become parties.    On theother hand it would be embarrassing ifcertain states in Europe with whom theproposed participants are already in closetreaty relations were not included amongthe parties.    H.M. Government see noreason, however, to doubt that these states will gladly accept its terms.    Uhiversa-lity would in any case be difficult ofattainment and might even be inconvenient,for there are some states whose governments have not yet been universally recognised,and some which are scarcely in a positionto ensure the maintenance of good order and security within their territorios.    Theconditions for the inclusion of such statesamong the parties to the now treaty is aquestion to which further attention may
porhaps be devoted with advantage.    It is,however, a minor question as compared with the attainment of the more important purpose in view.12.      After this examination of the termsof the proposed treaty and of tho points towhich it gives rise, Your Excellency will realise that H.kL. Government find nothing intheir existing commitments which preventstheir hearty co-operation in this new move-ment for strengthening the foundations ofpeaceo    They will gladly co-operate inthe conclusion of such a pact as is proposed and are ready to engage with the interestedgovornments in the negotiations which arenecessary for the purpose.
