The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that he had looked up the remarkshe had made in the Debate on the Budget lastyear in regard to Publicans&apos; Licences, and had found that he had made it clear that the questionof Licence Duties could not be considered piece-meal, and had indicated that on some futureoccasion the question of the sale of spiritsby the half-bottle might be considered simul-taneously with Licence Duties.   The Division Listshowed that many Labour and Liberal members had voted in favour of the sale of spirits inthe half-bottle,,After a short discussion the cabinet agreed -That the Chancellor of theExchequer shoiild have authorityto announce a reduction in.Publicans&apos; Licences to theextent which he had indicated to the Cabinet at the previous meeting, and that if the ques-tion of the sale of spirits inthe half-bottle should be raisedMr Churchill should state thatIt was a question which theGovernment would be willingto leave to a free vote of theHouse of Commons.

THE indian statutory commission.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(28).  Con-elusion 1.)3, On the suggestion of the Secretary ofState for India,  the Cabinet agreed  That an early opportunity shouldbe found for Sir John Simon toattend a Meeting of the Cabinetto make a statement of the impressions he had formed  a athe result of his visit toIndia with the Indian StatutoryOommissi on.-3-
4. As arranged at their previous Meetingthe Cabinet re-examined the scheme of government policy to be explained by the Chancellor of theExchequer in his Budget Statement in thefollowing two respects:-(i) The desirability of includingrailways, canals and docksamong the services for whichrates would be remitted:(il) The question of whether payment in respect of de-rated propertiesshould be variable, as approvedby the Cabinet on April 4    1928(Cabinet 20 (28)    Conclusion 7),or at a fixed national rate, as contemplated earlier in the die-cussions of the Cabinet Committee,The Prime Minister informed his colleagues of the reasons which had induced him to ask theCabinet to re-examine this question.    he recalled that at one time the Cabinet Committeehad nearly reached agreement on a proposal fora reduction of rates on productive industry,including railways, by two-thirds, the rate to be collected by the Local Authorities.   Atthat moment a new proposal had been made for acomplete de-rating of productive industry, whichhad commended itself to the Cabinet Committee.Prom this scheme of complete de-rating it had been  necessary to drop the railways.    The Cabinet,however, had rejected the proposal for completede-rating of productive industry and had decided on a scheme of payments varying according to&apos;the rates of particular districts.   Several ofhis colleagues had suggested to him that thescheme in its present form was not the best possible, and that, now that the scheme of complete de-rating of productive industry had been dropped, railways might well be-4-
9 *) c*reinstated,,    In these circumstances he had feltthat the Cabinet ought to give further consider-ation to the matter.In the course of a very long discussion the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the Cabinetthe following estimates of the cost of various schemes:-(i) A scheme for a variable rate ofone-fourth, applying to railways,canals and docks,  as well as to industries, would cost to theExchequer  26*7 millions:(ii) A scheme for a variable rate ofone-third    including railways.canal3 and docks    would cost tothe Exchequer  24*2 millions:(ili) A scheme for a flat payment of 5/-sincluding railways, canals anddocks, would cost to the Exchequer 22ffl8 millions,As the result of a long discussion the Cabinet agreed (in each case by a majority) -(a) That railways, canals and docksshould be included in the scheme:(b) To adhere to the previous decisionfor4the payment,  in respect of thede-fated properties,  of a uniformrate of one-fourth of the poundageof the particular areas .The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed his colleagues that it would be necessary for&apos; him to go carefully into the finance of thisdecision and to discuss with the President ofthe Board of Trade the application of the schemeto railways, canals and docks02, Whitehall Gardens, S .W.1,April 20, 1928*
