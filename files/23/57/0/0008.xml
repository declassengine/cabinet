THE ROAD CON-VEYANCE OPPASSENGERSAND GOODS EYRAILWAYCOMPANIES.(previous reference:Cabinet ?(28), Oon-clusion 7.)1. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum(Paper C.P.--39    (28)) by the Minister ofTransport in regard to the Road Conveyance of passengers and Goods by Railway Companies, inwhich it was suggested that the Minister ofTransport should make a statement, in very general terms,  to the effect that the Government has notclosed Its mind to the idea of an inquiry intothe possibility of better co-ordination of themeans of transport generally, but that he should state plainly that the desirability or non-desirability of such an inquiry is no reasonwhatever against the present Rill submitted bythe Railway Companies.    It was further suggested for consideration whether the Government Whipsshould not be put on as tellers when the divisionon the Second Reading of these Railway Billstakes place, so as to ensure that they are referred for full investigation to a SelectCommittee (preferably a Joint Committee of bothHouses).   Authority was also asked in the Memoran-dum for the President of the Board of Trade andthe Minister of Transport to settle the preciselines of any statement or report to be made inregard to the obligations or restrictions whichshould be attached, in the Government&apos;s view, toany powers granted to the Railway Companies.After hearing a statement by the Ministerof Transport, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposals in Pap^r C.P.-39 (28):(b) That the best method for investi-gating the details of the RailwayBills would be by means of a JointCommittee of both Houses, and thatthe Minister of Transport shouldbe authorised to take any stepswithin his power to promote thatmethod:
That the Prime Minister should consult the Chief &quot;hip on thequestion of whether the Govern-ment   :hips should be put on astellers when the division onthe Second Reading of theRailway ^ills takes place:That the Minister of transport should keep in close touch withthe Prime Minister on the subject
CHINA.Reduction ofPore es in th ePar East.(previous reference:Cabinet 6(28), Con-clusion 4.)2.   The Cabinet bad before their a Note by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP.-28 (28))stating that the return of the Third destroyer flotilla from China will shortly be necessary tomeet administrative and training requirements;that the Naval Commander-in-Chief, China, canspare the Flotilla when the state o^ the Yangtseadmits o^ Cruisers proceeding to Hankow;    andthat, provided th &quot; political situation gives rise to no necessity for modifying this arrange-ment.  the Flotilla will be withdrawn from Chinaabout the beginning of May.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he would raise no objection to the return othe Third Destroyer Flotilla from China.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed.To approve the proposal o^ theFirst Lord of the Admiralty forthe return of the Third destroyer flotilla froir China about thebeginning of May, provided thatthe political situation in China in the interval gives rise to no necessity for modifying thisarrangement.
REDACTION MBLIMITATION of armaments.Committee on policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(27), Con-elusion 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them the second report of the Reduction and Limitation of Anna-ments Committee on Policy (Paper C.P.-44 (28)),containing proposals which may be summarised asfollows:-IN REGARD TO SECURITY:The promotion of agreements on Locarno lines, where they are appropriate, might be boldlyadvocated.The Finnish proposal shouldbe pushed forward without hesi-tation, whether it is received with enthusiasm by other powers or not?    though the former condi-tion that it should not be pressedexcept as part of a general schemeof disarmament is desirable, thisshould not be regarded as as^ne qua npn.Lord Oushendun should have discretion to deal with technicalpoints relating to the applica-tion of the Covenant to arbitra-tion and conciliation, etc.AS REGARDS DISARMAMENT:Lord Cushendun might with advantage   aim at discussingfirst the Air Service, then theNavy, taking the Army last.The two possible alternatives to the position taken up at theThree-Power Naval Conference,proposed by the Admiralty, arenot recommended, as the Committeeare very anxious, as far as possible,to prevent the re-awakening of thecontroversies with America.The proposals as to capital ships, their size, their age andtheir armament, which formed partof the Geneva plan at the Three-Power Conference at Geneva^ might with advantage be put forward.If the breakdown of the Confer-ence appears inevitable, our repre-sentative should endeavour tosecure that the breakdown occurson the refusal of the FrenchGovernment to consent to thelimitation of military reserves.
The Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster made statements to theCabinet in regard to the Report of the CabinetCommittee.    Lord Cushendun warned the Cabinetthat the materials for a &quot;sustained initiative&quot;on the Security side of the question (page 3 ofthe Report) were not likely to prove very satis-factory, as the arguments in favour of extensions of the Locarno policy had already been used on several occasions.   He asked for a certain latitudeon various points.    Among others,  in connectionwith Disarmament, notwithstanding the contraryReport of the Cabinet Committee, he asked for authority to make inquiries in order to ascertain whether something could be done in the directionof the concessions offered by the Admiralty tomeet the French or even the American point of view.After discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the Reportof the Cabinet Committee (paper cp.-44 (28)) as a guide for theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterat the forthcoming discussions atGeneva:(b) That,  in pressing forward the Finnishproposal for financial support to a power against which the Council ofthe League of Nations should declarean aggression to have been committed,Lord Cushendun should adhere to theprevious condition that our accept-ance was subject to co-operation byother Powers, but should have dis-cretion to waive the other condition that it should not be pressed except as attached to an effective scheme of disarmament:(c) That in regard to the concessionsproposed by the Admiralty, if theFrench should themselves propose any mov.-. in this direction, LordGush endan should have discretion,if he thinks fit, to offer hissupport,  though he should not himselfinitiate these proposals:
That within   the limits of thepolicy summarised above, lord cushendun should have the widestdiscretion in the conduct of his negotiations at Geneva.
4,   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Rome Secretary (Paper CP.-3 (38))circulating for consideration a first draftof the Repr-sentFvtion of ^he People (EqualFranchise) Bill, 1928, and giving explanationsas to the various provisions in the draft Bill.The subject v:as postponed to aSpecial Vesting of the Cabinetto be held probably on Tuesdaynext,  February 21st.
1 i KlidRUBBERRESTRICTIONS.f previous reference:Cabinet 51(27), Con-elusion 7(b) .)5, The Secretary of State for the Coloniesmade a statement to the Cabinet, which wasreinforced by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade, as tothe dec: oral is ati on and dislocation to the rubbermarket owing to the present uncertainty.   TheCabinet were urgnd to ask the Rambling Committee,set up under the Corrmittee of Civil Research, to address themselves to the question of the desira-bility of an announcement by the Government that whatever changes they might recommend should not come into effect before some date to be fixed.That the Secretary of State should ascertain from Sir H. Hambling&apos;sCommittee whether they would be preparedto advise that a statement should bemade by the Prime Minister to theeffect that whatever their recommendahio:no change would be made before a certain date;    if the Committee was so prepare the Secretary of State could thenconsult confidentially the aopropriateauthorities in the City (e.g.,  theChairman of the Stock Exchange and a leading rubber broker, as well as SirHerbert Hambling) and obtain all thenecessary information both as to thebest form of an announcement and asto the appropriate moment for making it with the least possible dislocationto the industry.After discussion the Cabinet agreed -That th^Secretary sf State forthe Colonies^shotxla consult confi-
libTHE BASLETRADINGCOMPANY.( previous cms reference:Cabinet 6(28), Con-elusion 15*)6AThe Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum(Paper C.P.-15 (28)) by the Acting Secretary ofState for the Colonies in regard to a claimagainst His Majesty&apos;s Government by the BasleMission Trading Society in connection withand India,their properties in the Gold Coast/.   The sugges-tion of the Acting Secretary of State was that a select Committee of both Houses of parliament should be set up to consider the whole question and tG **fce recommendations for a settlement;that        $erms of Reference should relateexclusively to the Gold Coast and should be asfollows:-*To consider and report upon the actions taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in 1918 In relation tothe Basle Mission Trading society in the Colony of the Gold Coast;To consider the circumstances which led to the formation of theCommonwealth Trust;    and to eon-sider the general position of that company;To advise whether any, and if so what, action should be taken to terminate that Company&apos;s existence,upon what terms?     andTo report generally upon the steps which should be taken to bringabout a settlement of the questionsnow in dispute;The proposal for a Joint Select Committee-of both Houses did not commend Itself to theCabinet^ who, after considerable discussion,agreed --(a) That the general policy of theGovernment towards this question should be to recognise that theproperty was wrongfully disposedof to the Commonwealth Trust, andthat it would have to be returnedto its original owners (the BasleTrading Company) together with thesum of  120,000 (the nominal capital of the Company) and the accrued
Interest on that sum;    that thecapital ( 60,000)  of the Common-wealth Trust, to which the property was handed over, must be safeguarded;but that,  if necessary, the Common-wealth Trust must be compelled, byan Ordinance passed in the GaldCoast Colony, to surrender theproperty;(b) To take note that the Treasuryinsist strongly that any costmust be borne by the Gold CoastColony J(c) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should pursue thenegotiations with the parties concerned in execution of theabove policy;(d) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should instruct the spokesman, of the Government inthe House of Lords in the forth-coming Debate as to the general lines of the case he is to make.
IRISHLOYALISTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 7(28), Con-conclusion 5.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer read tothe Cabinet a draft statement for announcement in Parliament which he had prepared to giveeffect to the decision reached at the previous meeting.In the course of a short discussion asuggestion was made that, insomuch as theprevious decision had been varied because ourhonour was engaged, it would be better not again to limit the Governments commitment to a totalof  1,000,000, but to make it clear that thebalance of this sum would be available in thecoming financial year (1928-29) and that any additional sum required to implement the WoodRent-on Committee&apos;s recommendations would bevoted in later years.   This suggestion, however,was not adopted.The Cabinet approved the draftread to them by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (Appendix)subject to a small addition(which was accepted by theChancellor of the Exchequer)of the words underlined in thefollowing sentence on the lastpage:-&quot;Of the excess over this figure 60 per cent, willbe advanced on accountimmediately*.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,February 17    1928.
A P P EN D IX.As the House is aware,  the British. Government of1922 publicly stated that they could not divest themselves of a duty to see that, claims to compensation in respectof injuries to oei^son or property in the Irish FreeState in the period i-rim.edir.tely following the Treaty wereeouitably met.       In 192G a Committee was set up underthe Chairmanship of Lord Dunedin to reoort whether any action beyond that already taken should be taken byHis Majesty1 s Government.      This Committee found, thatthe persons who were entitled to rely on the abovepromise were those persons only whC had sufferedinjuries in respect of their allegiance to the Governmentof the United Kingdom and that that Government shouldtake definite steps to alleviate to the best of their ability such injuries in cases where compensation hadeither not been given or had been less  than equitable.The Dunedin Committee further stated that the decision as  to what grants should be made must rest with HisV-iaj.es ty&apos; s Government who however should be assisted inthe investigation of claims by an advisory body.In consequence a. Committee under Sir Alexanderwood. Renton was set up in October 1926 to advise HisMajesty&apos;s Government whether in cases as defined bv theDunedin Committee some further ex gratia grant should inreason and fairness be made to the   claimants in additionto anv compensation already awarded.His Majesty&apos;s Government had no means  of knowingwith certainty,  until the work of the Committee was complete, the extent of the hardship with which theywould have to deal.      On the other hand it was-obviousthat in no circumstances could the Government assign to
an advisory Committee the power of comm.:itting theExchequer to an indefiniteliability.&quot;They therefore decided in harmony with Lord Dunedin&apos;s Report thatthe function of the Committee  should not be to makecould not bind themselves  to act on the advice, but would have in their minds a limit of expenditure beyond,which they would not be prepared to fo,  so that, if theCommittee&apos;s recommendations exceeded that amount,  theGovernment would find it necessary to adjust the payments in each Individual case accordingly.These conclusions were communicated,  at the timewhen the Committee was being set up, bv the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs  to Sir Alexander Wood-Eerton.As the Committee has proceeded in its work ithas become clear that its recommendations wouldconsiderably exceed in amount the limits which theGovernment have been led to assign.      It was found impossible to wait until the conclusion of the wholeEnquiry before taking final decisions.      The positionof many of the claimants was  such that uncertainty as to the final awards was in itself involving hardship.The Government therefore decided in December last toextend the original limit which they had fixed, from 400,000 to  625,000.      It now appears from all theevidence we have been able to collect that the totalcompensation which may be recommended by the Mood-Rent on Committee including the payments already maderaav be approximately  1 million.      In these circumstances the Government have examine&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;  very closely the principles which have guided the Committee in making their recommendations.      They have come to the conclusionawards, but only to  sdyise.The Gove rnine nt
that the Committee^ work has been clone at every stagewith a due regard to the Interests of the general public and that the recommendations cannot be consideredexcessive.      They have also satisfied- themselves thatthe drastic scaling down of these recommendations&quot; o uld Inflict in numerous cases severe, unmeritedhardship upon individuals, which hardship might reflectupon the sincerity with which the Government have  riveneffect to the undertakings of their predecessors.It remains  impossible for any Government to commititself In a matter of this kind to a liability withoutlimits.      I therefore take this opportunity of statinsthat an increased sum not exceeding  1 million will beheld available as required in satisfaction of these claims,All awards up to  1,000 ---ill at once be paid infull.      Of the excess over this figure 60% will be advanced on account immediately.      The residue of the 1 million will be applied, to the recommendations at  the close of the Enquiry in so far as thev have not been already Implemented..The House will understand the difficulty whichnaturally arises in reconciling!: a strict and fairdischarge of engagements in which the State has enteredwith the nee^ of protecting the Sxchecmer from an indefinite liability.I should add that this decision must be taken as final so far as His : a.iesty1 s present advisers areconcerned.
