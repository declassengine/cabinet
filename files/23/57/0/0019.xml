rg/tKAGE OP 3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer read to$FORMATION.the Cahinet an extract from the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;(previous giving a not wholly inaccurate description ofInference:Cabinet 1 the matters discussed at the Cahinet on the(28), Con-clasion 8.) previous day.The general view of the Cabinet was thata good deal of the article might have been arrived at by intelligent anticipation andpiecing together information which had alreadybeen published or had leaked out.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the &quot;Daily News and Westminster&quot;had published an article giving the impression that the Cabinet had become concerned with egypt and Nahas Pasha&apos;s letter during the whole ofthe two meetings on the previous day.   He had felt it necessary to contradict this statement.
n 6*4. Th6 Cabinet resumed their considerationof the Reports circtilated by the Policy Committee,and the following took part in the discussion:-The Minister&apos; of Agriculture and Fisheries;the Lord Privy Seal;    the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster;    the Lord Chancellor;    theSecretary of State for India;    the Secretaryof State for Air;    the First Commissioner ofWorks;    the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.While there was a strong body of opinion in favour of proceeding with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer&apos;s Plan in   3*ome shape - or form,and while it was felt that in view of tentativeannouncements alreadv made on the subieet actionV fcjof some kind was essential, there was generalagreement that, in order to carry so comprehensivea scheme, a united Cabinet and a united party was essential, and, above all, that the Ministerof Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland,as the Ministers mainly concerned, must be incordial agreement with the policy.There was general agreement that, as partof the seherre, Agriculture ought to be entirelyde-rated, and that the Railways should be excluded.In the course ox the discussion a suggestionemerged for reconciling two conflicting principles,namely, the Chancellor of the Excheqxier&apos; s principlethat all productive indxistry ought to be treatedas regards payment of rates on a basis of equal-ity; and the Minister of Health&apos;s principle thatproductive industry must not be entirely divorced(as it would be if de-rated altogether) from
Interest in the government of the locality inwhich It is situated.   The suggestion was that,instead of productive industry being de-ratedto the extent of two-thirds, it should bede-rated to a greater extent: &apos; in other words,that productive industry should still pay separately, varying in accordance with the rates ofthe localities in which the particular concernsare situated, but that the proportion paid shouldbe substantially lower than the one-third givenin Paper C.P.-105 (38) as an alternative toeon:pi ete d e-rating.The Cabinet adjourned in order that thisproposal might first be discussed between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofHealth (and the Secretary of State for Scotland)and subsequently, later in the afternoon, bythe Policy Committee.The Minister of Health was also asked toconsid-r *he possible application of this newsuggestion to Mines.The Cabinet decided to meetimmediately after the memorial service to the late ViscountCave on the following day,instead of at 11-50 as previous-ously arranged,  and to hold afurther Meeting on Wednesdayafternoon at some time to befixed at the morning Meeting.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 5,  1938.
