EGYPT.(previous reference e:Cabinet 63(37), Con-clusion 2.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinet that at the moment thenegotiations with Egypt did not wear a very satis-factory aspect.    Sarwat Pasha, who ought to know the best tactics to adopt, appeared rather to have lost position by delay in pressing forward withthe matter.-1-
THE UKITBD 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSTATES OFAMERICA. reported to the Cabinet that proposals had beenArbitration received from the United States of Air-erica in regardProposals .  to the revision of the Root Arbitration Treaty, asBelligerentRights. well as a suggestion for a multilateral Treaty.It appeared that these proposals would include the(previous reference: question of Belligerent Rights at Sea among theCabinet 57(27),, Con- subjects for possible arbitration, and the questionclusion 7.)would arise as to whether a reservation should be-entered.    Sir Austen Chamberlain was hoping to dealwith/ the various proposals in a single Memorandum whichwould be circulated to the Cabinet.- p.-
FILMS CENSOR- 3, The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSKIP.  reported to the Cabinet that it had come to his proposedNurse Oavell knowledge that a British Film Company intendedFilm,in the near future to bring out a film entitled&quot;Dawn&quot;, dealing with the case of Nurse Cavell.Inquiries as to the nature of this film had been addressed to the Foreign Office, in an informalmanner, by the representatives of Belgium andGermanye    Such information as he had. tended toshow that it was proposed to include in the film aversion of the shooting of Nurse Cavell, the historical accuracy of which he had not been ableto confirm and which in any event, even if correct,could do no good and was calculated to stir up thebitterest feelings and to promote internationalcontroversy.   Sir Austen Chambex^ain wished to consult the Cabinet as to what action, if anv,should be taken*After some discussion the Cabinet agreedthat the best course would be for the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to discuss the matterpersonally with Mr TeP.O&apos;Connor, the British FilmCensor.
government business.The Programmeof Legislation,(previous reference:Cabinet 64(27), Con-elusion 5.)REPRESENTATIONOF THE PEOPLE(EQUAL PRANOHIS:BILL.(previous reference e:Cabinet 27(27), Con-conclusion 7.)HOUSE OF lords reform of(previous reference:Cabinet 64(27), Con-elusion 5.)THE factories bill.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(27), Con-elusion 2.)THE. CHILDRENBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 63(27),  Con-elusion 8.)SLUM CLEARANCE,(previous reference:Cabinet 7(27), Con-elusion 1.)THE NEWPRAYER&apos;BOOK.3)4.   The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion inregard to legislation for the forthcoming Sessionof Parliament.   There was a general realisationthat the amount of legislation to be proposed inthe King&apos;s Speech must be kept within narrow limits,in order to avoid congestion of Parliamentary time.The Prime Minister indicated that it would hardly be possible to avoid an Autumn Session, which,however, he hoped might be limited to a fortnight.Suggestions which had been made at previousdiscussions on this question were repeated and pressed, namely, that the    debates      on the Eing&apos;sSpeech were unduly prolonged and that an unnecessaryamount of time was devoted to &quot;the discussion ofSupplementary Estimates.    In this connection theCabinet were informed that there was every prospectof the Supplementary Estimates being fewer in number and less in the amounts involved than in formeryears.There was general agreement that in any event the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise)Bill must be pressed forward.   The question of Rouseof Lords   Reform was also mentioned as a subject which would have to be taken up before long.Among the Bills the merits of which wouldhave to be weighed at the Cabinet&apos;s next discxissionon this question, were mentioned the Factories Bill,the Children Bill (Paper C.P.-5 (28)), and a slum clearance Bill,   The Cabinet were also informed that two days of Parliamentary time would probably haveto be given to the Prayer Book measure.A. suggestion was made that as the next GeneralElection would probably not/take place before May,1929, it might be possible to reserve one considerable
treasure for the year 1929-30.With a viev: to a comprehensive discussion othe legislation of the Session at a Meeting of thCabinet on Wednesday, January 25th, the cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary should be instructed to ask all cabinet ministers to forward a list ofthe Bills they would like tohave considered for introductionduring the coming parliamentary session:(b) that the Chief Whip should beasked to provide a sketch time-table showing the amount of timelikely to be available for legis-lation.
THE indian statutory commission.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(27), Con-clusion 4.)5. The Secretary of State for India informed hiscolleagues that the Indian Statutory commission would be leaving Victoria Station on Thursday,January 19th, at 1-40 p.m.   He asked that any ofhis colleagues who might find it possible should be present, particularly any who had been associatedin any way with India.The Prime Minister intimated his intentionof being present.
IN35IANISA7IONOP THE indian army,(previous reference:Cabinet 64(27), Con-elusion 3.)6.

CHINA.Withdrawal ofAircraftCarrier.(previous reference:Cabinet 51(27), Con-conclusion 3.)7. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (Paper C.P.-1 (28))stating that, unless objections were raised by anymember of the Cabinet, he proposed to withdraw theAircraft Carrier H ,M*S e &quot;Argus * from the ChinaStation, leaving there H.M.S. &quot;Hermes&quot; with 15aircraft, 6 aircraft based on shore, and 3 aircraft in H.M.S. &quot;Vindictive&quot; until the latter vesselshould be relieved by H.M.S. &quot;Cumberland&quot; in the spring.
THE naval construction programme .(previous reference:Cabinet 64(27), Con-clusion 1.)LEAFAGE OFINFORMATION.(previous ousReferenc e:Cabinet 19(26), Con-clusion 11.)8. The First Lord of the Admiralty called theattention of the Cabinet to information published in &quot;The Shipping World&quot; containing some details ofthe Cabinet decision, referred to in the margin, inregard to the Naval Programme.   Some of the dailynewspapers, Mr Bridgeman reported, containedmisleading information on the subject.   In thecircumstances, he thought that an official announce-ment of the Government&apos;s policy ought to be made.A short discussion took place in regard tothe leakage of information in regard to theServices,    It was stated that there had been aleakage in regard to the work of the Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence on Cavalry.Mention was also made of the leakage of Air Forceinformation, which had transpired during theespionage trial now in progress.   The suggestion was made that the leakage was apt to occur at theService Clubs.The Cabinet agreed  That the First Lord of the Admiralty,in consultation wj.th the Chancellorof the Exchequer,&apos;should draw up anofficial statement in regard to theNaval Construction Programme as approved by the Cabinet on December22nd, 1927, and should issue it tothe Press., Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January 18, 1928.
