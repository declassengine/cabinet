In connection with his statement on thesubject of th^ Budget, the Chancellor of theExchequer informed the Cabinet that he hadinterviewed representatives of the RailwayCompanies on the previous day and had informedthem that it was not at present proposed toinclude the railways among the services forwhich rates wou^d be remitted in the scheme now under consideration.    The representativesof the Railway Companies had expressed thegreatest regret.   Although it had been contem-plated that the Companies should pass on toother industries the advantages they would receive in the remission of rates, neverthelessthey desired to be included in the schemeowing to the immense advantage which they believed would accrue to trade and Industryand thus indirectly to the railways from their inclusion.    In these circumstances the Chancellorof the Exchequer ashed 15 the Cabinet wouldeven now be willing to re-examine the questionof the Inclusion of the railways.   Ha alsoappealed for re-consideration of the decision that the payment in respect of de-rated proper-ties should be variable, and expressed a strongpreference for a fixed national rate forproductive Industry.The Cabinet agreed  To discuss the question at aSpecial Meeting to be held onthe following day, at 11 a.n.,at the House of Commons..2, Whitehall Gardens,  S .V.1,19.n on o
