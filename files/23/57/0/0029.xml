1.     The Cabinet had before them a letter,circulated by direction of the Prime Minister,from the Chairman of the Conservative andUnionist Party ashing for instructions In regardto a conference between representatives of theUnionist Liberal and Labour Parties  on thesubject of the broadcasting of controversy,which had been suggested by the British Broad-easting Corporation (Paper C.P.-158 (28)).Prom this Memorandum it transpired thatthe following scheme had been proposed on behalfof the British Broadcasting Corporation:-(a) For an initial period of threeweeks each of the three parties should be given an opportunityof arranging for an uncensoredenunciation of Party policy,lasting for half an hour,  theParties following each other in successive weeks:(b) After this period of three weeks the system should be put upon afortnightly basis, in the rotaof a Government spokesman to eachOpposition spokesman:(c) That the system should continue until the dissolution of Parlia-ment, subject to special arrange-ments being made by agreementbetween the Parties during the periods when the House of commons would not be in session:(d) That during the General Electionthe general principle should bethat each Party should have equalfacilities, arrangements beingdecided upon later.Difficulties, however, had been found in some quarters In accepting these proposals, with theresult that the conference already referred tohad been proposed.    In the event of a conference the main issue to be joined was likely to be onthe question whether the system should be based
on the rota of a Government spokesman to eachOpposition spokesman or whether the three parties should follow each other in rotation.The Cabinet agreed -That the Prime Minister should instruct the representatives ofthe Conservative and unionist party at the Conference to stand firm In support of the original proposals of the british broadcasting Corporation, whereby the Government of the day wouldhave an opportunity of replying to each of the other political parties;    that is to say that the spokesman for the Government shouldhave equal rights with the spokesman of each of the opposition parties a
NAVAL OON-STRUCTXONPROGRAM IE .The Type ofCruiser for1928-29 .(previous reference:Cabinet 64(27), Con-clusion 1.)*T) 42.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper C.P.-156 (28)) in regard to the question of whetherthe two   Cruisers approved for the Naval Con-struction Programme for 1928--29 should beClass &quot;A&quot; or Class WB*, a question which hadbeen reserved by the Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin in order that all the factors bearing on the situation might be ^nownbefore the Cruisers are laid down.In view of the fact that the dropping ofcertain Cruisers from the British ConstructionProgrammes of the last two years had not resultedin   any change in the actual authorised pro-grammes of other Powers, and that all the cruisers of the American Programme would be of      $Wthe Class &quot;A&quot; type, the First Lord recommendedthat the Eritish Cruisers should be of the &quot;A&quot;type and requested the authority of the Cabinetto proceed accordingly.The Cabinet were reminded that, since the circulation of the Memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty,  information had been receivedfroir    Washington (Sir E. Howard, No.155, of May15th) on the authority of &quot;The Times&quot; Correspond-ent there, to the effect that the American naval construction Bill was lihely to be held over until the next Session in December.The Cabinet were given to understand thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer (absent throughprobablvindisposition) was/in agreement with the Admiralty&apos;proposal, but tbe Cabinet felt that the formal
45-6ii  decision on the matter should be subject to hisconcurrence.   On this condition the cabinet agreed  To approve the proposal of theFirst lord of the Admiralty thatthe two Cruisers to be laid downin 1928-29 should be of the Class&quot;A&quot; type.The Secretary was instructed to obtainthe decision of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer at the earliestpossible moment.
3.    The Cahinet had before then? a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (paper c.P.-152 (28))  stating that he had receivedfrom the Iron and Steel Wire ManufacturersAssociation an application for an Inquiry underthe Safeguarding of Industries Procedure inregard to Iron and Steel Wire of all kinds .He recalled that a similar application, made in1925 as part of a general application by theIron and Steel industry, had been rejected onthe ground that the Government&apos;s decision inregard to the application of the steel industry as a whole would apply also to sectional appli-cations.    A similar attitude had been adopted towards a separate application made in February,1926.   The President of the Board of Tradetherefore expressed In his Memorandum the pre-sumption that he should inform the applicantsthat the decision of 1926 still stands, viz.:-&quot;The Government have given carefulconsideration to the arguments advanced, but they are of opinionthat the same consideration whichdebarred them from referring thelarger application to a Committeewould in fact operate in regard tosectional applications&quot;.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the President of the Board ofTrade in Paper CP.-152  (28)  asset forth above.
