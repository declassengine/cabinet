1, The Home Secretary informed the Cabinetthat, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govermrent,he had, during the discussion of the Represen-tat ion of the People (Equal Franchise) Bill,rejected the proposal that there should be twofree postages during Gen-ral Elections.   he understood this to be in accordance with thegeneral view of the Cabinet, but he found therewas no formal record in the Cabinet Minutes .The Cabinet approved the HomeSecretary&apos;s action.
2. The Secretary of State -for Foreign affairs said that he had sent a despatch to Lord Lloydin accordance with the wishes of his colleagues,to whom it would be circulated in the immediatefuture .
3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that recent telegrams indicated thatthe arrangement made with the Nanking government by the United States of America was more favourablthan was at first thought.    It did not containany apology for firing at Nanking, and the references in the Notes to a new Treaty positiondid not result from this episode but fromdeclarations made long before by the AmericanGovernment,    In the circumstances Sir austen chamberlain had telegraphed to Sir Miles Lamps onindicating; that a settlement on similar terms would be acceptable to His Majesty&quot;s Government,
4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that Sir Francis Humphryshad reported that the impression made on FingAmanullah by his visit to this country was veryremarkable and that the visit must be pronounceda great success.    Sir Austen Chamberlain had asked Sir Francis Humphrys to send him a Memo-randum on the subject of the visit for circula-tion to the Cabinet.-4-

The Cabinet had&apos; before there a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs circu-lating for consideration a draft Instruction teMr Craigie, of the Foreign Office, to proceedto &quot;Washington for the purpose of explainingfully to Sir Eerie&quot; Howard the point which hasnow been reached in the Committee&apos;s -delibera-tions end of obtaining for the benefit of theCommittee the Ambassador&apos;s considered views in regard to the future course of1 action(Paper C.P.-112 (28)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinet that since he had circu-. lated the above Note he had decided that, insteadof an Instruction to Mr ilraigi^, he would address a formal despatch to Sir&apos;Esme Howard, the british ambassador at Washington, of which Mr, Craigieshould be the bearer.   The first part of thedespatch would be conceived on-the same lines as the first five paragraphs of the draftInstruction attached to&quot; CP.-112 (28).    the later paragraphs would be amended mutatis mutandis.He would make It clear that the British G-overn-ment did not wish to initiate conversations ornegotiations at the present stage, but if SirEsme Howard thought that there was any risk thatMr Kellogg was about to launch without warningan invitation to a Conference, the ambassador should be authorised, either proorio motu or as acting under instructions, to ask the Secretaryof State not to take action without previousconversations .    If It was&apos; unlikely that Mr Kellogghad any such intentions, Sir Esme Howard would be
given permission, if he thought fit, to ask hisNaval Attache to make discreet inquiries as towhether the traditional attitude of the UnitedStates Government showed any signs of changingas the result of the great increase in their navy the despatch would also indicate that it wouldbe natural for Mr Craigie, while passing throughWashington on leave, to pay a visit to the state department;    and would suggest that possiblyadvantage might be taken of any such visit for him to obtain some information, but would make clear that he should do nothing of the kindwithout the Ambassador&apos;s authority, and in anycase Mr Craigie should intimate plainly that hewas acting on his own initiative and not underins true tions .In the course of&quot; a discussion allusionswere made to the more fundamental questions ofpolicy involved in the question of BelligerentRights, but the subject was not pursued since it Is under consideration by a special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.Emphasis was laid on the importance of making it quite clear that His Majesty&apos;s government did not desire to invite or encourage a reopening of this question at the present stage.The Cabinet approved the adoptionof CP.-112 (28) as the basis ofa despatch to be addressed by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs to the British ambassador in Washington, of which Mr Craigiewould be the bearer.
s% r* r r $ 36-    The Secretary of State for the Coloniesasked the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency, toconsider what action, if any, should be takenin regard to the transmission of arms from thiscountry to Xbn Saud.In the course of the discussion it transpired that during the negotiations between sir Gilbert Clayton and Ibn Saud a year ago the latter had attached great importance to obtaining arms and ammunition, with the resultthat an undertaking on the subject had beenattached to the Treaty of Jeddah.    Subsequentlyarrangements had been made for the furnishingof arms, which, as the Cabinet learned at theend of the Meeting, were the property of the AirMinistry.   The question the Cabinet had toConsider was as to whether this war materialshould be allowed to leave this country.    Onthe one hand it was pointed out that it would bemonstrous, if hostilities supervened, thatBritish airmen should be shot, at by arms supplied from, this country;    but,  on the other hand, our good faith was recognised to be bound up withthe despatch of these weapons, and the opinionof Sir Gilbert Clayton was read to the Cabinetto the effect that he would hesitate to undertake the negotiations If an embargo were placed onthis war material.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State for air should allow the war material destined for Ibn Saud to leave this country,but should have it detained at PortSudan if in the interval an arrange-tent was not made with Ibn Saud:
(b) That the Secretary of State for air should inform the shippers that wewere hoping to secure a peaceful settlement with Ibn Saud. but thatin the contrary event action wouldbe taken as summarised above in(a), and that they must not allow the war material to be landed atJeddah without permission:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should telegraph to the Consul at Jeddah to ask forinformation as to whether Ibn Saudhas received our proposal to sendSir Gilbert Clayton, and,  if the consul has no information,instruct him to send anothermessage at once to Ibn Saud:(d) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take stepsto ascertain whether Sir GilbertClayton&apos;s view is still the sameas that expressed on March 9thand read to the Cabinet;(e) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should communicate the tenor of the above decisions to the Figh Commissioner in Iraq,who should be asked to inform theAir Officer Commanding.
7.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed.the Cabinet that the Policy Committee had met onthe previous evening and had agreed unanimouslythe Conclusion set forth below in (a).The Minister of Health confirmed his Prime Minister congratulated the PolicyCommittee on the agreement reached, which wouldenable the Government to proceed with theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Plan.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To accept the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s Plan,  on the basis of -(i) The exclusion from the  schemeof Public Utility Undertakings,including the Railways;(ii) The Payment,  in respect ofthe de-rated properties, ofa uniform rate of one-fourthof the poundage of theparticular area:(b) That the Chancellor of the -exchequer should he careful,  in his budget statement, to avoid committing theGovernment in any way to actionin relief of the rating of railways,but that the possibility of actionof some kind at a later stage,  if and when the finance might beavailable, with a view to assistingproductive industry by arrangementsaffecting the railway rates shouldnot be excluded by the presentdecision from the Cabinet&apos;consideration.to recommend. the Cabinet to adopt hiacceptance of this arrangement.
L 0 0IONS-(previous reference:Cabinet 51(27). Oon-conclusion 7(d).)8. The Cabinet had before them the VerySecret Report of a Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Civil Research on Rubber Restrictions (PaperO.Po-111 (38)), the recommendations of whichsummarised in Paragraph 49 as follows:-(i) The rapid growth of rubber supplies from, and the extension of plantingsin,  he unrestricted areas,  the potentialities of which are verygreat, have made the restrictionscheme increasingly ineffectiveto secure the objects for whichit was introduced.(il)  Owing to these causes it oannotbe relied upon to maintain a   stableprice for a limited supply of rubber.It has failed to secure the pivotalprice of l/9d. a lb. fixed in 1926,and is steadily becoming lesscapable of influencing the world price of rubber or of preventing the accumulation of stocks,(iii) The continuance of the scheme isnow most disadvantageous to growersIn the restricted areas and seriouslythreatens the predominant positionof the British Empire as a producer of plantation rubber.   If presenttendencies continue, the productivecapacity of the Netherlands east indies may at no distant date equalthat of British Malaya and Ceylonc ombined.(iv) The effects of restrictions now are -(a) in the restricted areas    to discourage progress in themanagement and cultivation of estates and to raise thecost of production;(b) in the unrestricted areas,particularly in the netherlands east Indies, to stimulate pro-due tion and new plantings, notonly of estate but also of native rubber, the increase ofwhich has been enormous, andto enable the industry to becarried on at full capacity and at the&apos;lowest costs;(c) in the United States of america to encourage the prodviction and use of reclaimed rubber and soto diminish the demand of thatcountry for plantation rubber.
(v) With lower prices the productionof native rubber and the use ofreclaimed rubber are likely to be appreciably checked.(vi) The disadvantages from which Britishproducers in the restricted areasnow suffer will be enhanced in proportion to the length of timefor which restriction is continued.(vii) Any attempt to apply an extendedrestriction scheme over the wholeof the area of the Netherlands east indies as well as of British malaya and Ceylon would be neither practi-cable nor desirable in the interestsof British growers, and no useful purpose would be served by againapproaching the Dutch Governmentfor their concurrence in any suchs cheme .(viii) The Government could not usefullyintervene in any negotiations whichmay be instituted by representativesof the Dutch rubber-growing industry with British producers with the viewto the consideration of a sellingpolicy.(ix) The effect of an announcement byHis MajestyTs Government that restric-tion would be removed at some speci-fled, but comparatively distant, date would probably be -(a) that the market, while remaining in some uncertainty, would atonce to a large extent discountthe effect of removal;(b) that in the meantime demand wouldbe restricted and the price of rubber kept down below the pivotalprice for the time being in force;(c) that with prices so reduced    theposition of British growers, whosecosts would be kept up by continuedrestriction, would during the intervening period be gravelyprejudiced.
The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That the Prime Minister shouldmake the following statement the same afternoon in the Houseof Commons:-&quot;The Government have received theReport of the Committee of civil research on the question of RubberRestriction and they have decidedthat all restrictions on theexport of Rubber from BritishMalaya and Ceylon will be removedon the 1st November, 1928, theexisting scheme being continuedunaltered in the meantime.&quot;(b) That the Report and the Conclusionsof the Committee of Civil research should not be published, but that,in the event of the question being raised in the House of Commons, theGovernment speakers should use thearguments in the Report to defendtheir policy.
* :\ *kd d J.U^B BOXERliJpElWTTY,(previous previous reference:Cabinet 9(28), Con-elusion 11.)9. The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked theCabinet, as a matter of urgency, to reconsider their previous decision in regard to the BoxerIndemnity, which was to the effect that the indemnity, including the funds accumulated andnot yet spent should not be confiscated but should be used on condition that the money wasmade available as soon as it could usefully be devoted to its original purpose.In the course of the discussion it transpir-ed that this decision was satisfactory neither tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer nor to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    From apolitical point of view it was open to almost all the objections of complete confiscation,while from the point of view of the exchequer the possibility of a future demand for this money would be highly unsatisfactory.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave some indications of the adjustments he would have tomake in his next Budget if this sum was not-forthcoming .The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that his previous objections werestrengthened by recent events.    If a settlement where reached at Nanking, the Chinese would regard the appropriation of these funds as a breach of faith;    if we failed, they would regard it asvindictive.    In the long run the appropriationof these funds would probably cost us moreindirectly than we gained directly.The President of the Board of Tradeemphasized the objections to anything which, mightcheck the present improvement in trade with China.
The Cabinet agreed -unanimously -That the Boxer Indemnity shouldnot be used in the forthcoming budget.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked to place on record his thanks to theChancellor of the Exchequer, who had relievedhim fr om a very great embarrassment.

gTNGAPORE 12.The Cabinet had before them a Note by thepgpSNCES. Secretary    (Paper C.P.-113 (20)) covering the(-previous following documents:-Reference!Cabinet 45 An Extract from the Draft Minutes(27), Con- of the 234th Meeting of the Committeeelusion 7.) of Imperial Defence, held on March 29,1928, recommending the Cabinet to approve an Interim Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee(C .I.D. Paper No.312-C):An Interim Report by the Chiefs ofStaff, Sub-Committee (C.I.D. PaperNo.302-0):A&quot;further Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee covering aReport by General Sir Webb GiJlman&apos;s Sub-Committee (Paper 0.O.S.-1C5)recommending that approval shouldbe given to the revised programme for the installation of the defencesproposed by that Committee.The general effect of the above Reportswas in the direction of economy, insomuch asthe completion of the first stage of the plan of gun defences was prolonged by two years,i.e.9 to the end of the financial year 1932-33and the defences to be provided in the first stage were somewhat reduced.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To adopt the recommendation   ofthe Committee of Imperial defence that they should approve the interim Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee (C.I.D. PaperNo.312-0, the Conclusions of whichare as follows:-(i) That the first stage of theplan of defence of Singapore,as approved by the Committeeof Imperial Defence and theCabinet (.215th and 218th. Meetings of the Committeeof Imperial Defence)Including provision for three15-inch guns, should be pro-ceeded with, subject to such modifications in detail asmay be adopted as the resultof the enquiry now bringconducted by General GIlimanfsSub-Committee.   This will not result in any economy duringthe financial year 1928-29,
(ii) That the time originally allowed(3 years)  for the completion ofthe firsb stage of the plan ofgun defences should be prolongedby 2 years, i.e., to the end ofthe financial year 1932-33.(ill) That in considering the first-stage of the programme, GeneralGillman*s Committee should assume that there Is no alteration inthe scale of attack as hithertolaid down;    with the exceptionof attack by Coastal Motor Boats,which, we are agreed, need notbe considered in present circumstances-stances.(iv) That consideration of the later stages of the plan of defence,which include the westerndefences, should be postponed for the present, since both thescale of attack and the scale of defence will be affected bythe assumptions to be made on certain matters on which it maybe possible to express more definite opinions a year or twohence,  such as the presence orabsence of battle cruisers onthe China Station;    detailed plans for mine fields;    thestrength of the Air Forces to..  be based on Singapore;    the degree of reliance to be placedon reinforcements from India;and other possible developments.To approve the further Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (paper o0oS .-135), together with the revised programme for the installation of the defences proposed by General Sir Webb&amp;illman,s Sub-Committee.

The Committee did not recommendthat at the present time any Duty should be imposed.   As it is laid down in the White paper that Safeguarding Duties will only be imposedif the Committee reported that a Duty ought tobe imposed, the President of the Board of Tradedid not recommend the imposition of a Duty and only proposed to publish the Report, in accordancewith established practice,  just before theintroduction of the Budget,The Cabinet approved the recommenda-tion of the President of the Boardof Trade as set forth above.

During the Meeting of the Cabinet theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs handed round a revised draft Treaty of Arbitration withthe United States, which had been drawn up bySir Cecil Hurst in consultation with Mr Malkinand Mr Gwyer, and revised by the Lord chancellor,The Cabinet were assured that the questioncompulsoryof Belligerent Rights was excluded froiyarbitra-tion by a passage in Article 2 of the draft treaty making it clear that it only applied to differences &quot;which are agreed to be justiciable&quot;in their nature by reason of being susceptible&quot;of decision by the application of a recognised&quot;rule of international law&quot;.Inquiry was made as to whether it wouldnot be possible to insert some provision in theTreaty to place this country in a positioncorresponding with that of the United States,whose Constitution reserves to the Senate thenecessity for approving the submission of eachcase to arbitration.The Cabinet were informed that the diffi-eulty of devising any corresponding safeguardarose from the fact that constitutionally the senate was entirely free from control by theexecutive, which was not true to the same extent in the case of the British Parliament.The Cabinet, feeling that further time wasIrequired for the stvidy of this Treaty, decidedto adjourn it, and instructed the Secretary to &quot;raise the question at the first Meeting of theCabinet after the Recess at which the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs could be present.
