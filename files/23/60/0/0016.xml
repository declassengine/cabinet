INDUCTION AND 1.K-DjIITA^TON OF (NOTE:    By special request, and with.0mei-jTS. the approval of the     ime Minister,a summary of the discussion is givenl(previous in addition to the Conclusion.) &quot;I Reference:I cabinet 13 The Cabinet had before them copies of tele-I (29), Con-loiusion 4.) grams which had passed  between Sir Esme Howardand the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsDHITEP STATESOP AMERICA, in regard to the forthcoming meeting of the Prepara-Wlo-American       tory Commission at Geneva (Paper CP.-107 (29)).Relations .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS:l(previous Reference: recalled that on his return from a long absenceI Cabinet 8(291. Con- abroad in the previous year he had informed the elusion C)Cabinet that, so far as Foreign Affairs were concerned, the subject which caused him the greates!anxiety was our relations with the United statesof America.    Although a great deal of progress had since been made outside the Cabinet in preparing the material, the course of events had been such that as yet the Cabinet had not been able to takea decision.    In consequence, the Foreign office was left in a position of difficulty and even ofsome peril.    There was a certain amount ofimpatience in our own country at the failure ofthe Government to reach a settlement on outstanding questions.    In the Dominions there was a certainamount of nervousness as to what was to be proposed.There was also the constant liability for newdisturbing rumours to arise in the United States .Neither the Foreign Office in London nor its representatives abroad were able to work towards an agreer.&apos;ent for want of a decision.   The result was a certain   malaise in our relations with america which at tir es was talked into a state ofand reacted on the ability of this countryto pull its full weight in settling European
questions.    Everyone abroad knew that so long as this .E:a.laise exists the authority of the repjssenta-tives of this country was pro tanto diminished indealing with European affairs .   As a nation weneeded all the authority we could assume at thepresent time when we were about to use our influ-once to obtain a settlement of the question of reparations and, what was even more important,  feesubjthe evacuation of the Rhineland.Consequently Sir Austen Chamberlain said he wouldhave been glad to reach a conclusion on thissubject earlier.   As matters stood, however, he recognised that he could not ask his colleagues totake large decisions of policy before the GeneralElection.   Nevertheless,  provided that he had some idea of the Cabinet&apos;s mind on the questions at issue, he could plead the General Election as a reason for delaying the actual negotiations.Sir Austen reminded the Cabinet that theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was leaving for Geneva on the following day.   He summarised the instructions to Lord Cushendun, as approved bythe Cabinet,  as follows:-   Firstly, he was to dissuade the Preparatory Commission from embarking on a discussion of the Naval issue,  on the groundthat substantial progress was not likely to be made until confidential discussions had taken place between the British and American Governments,Lord Cushendun, therefore, was to urge that theCommission should press on with limitation ofmilitary and air armaments .   He could support thisplea by pointing out that substantial progress had already been made in regard to Naval disarmament^whereas none had been made in regard to land and air-2-
armaments.   Secondly, if this proposal should beadopted but nevertheless it should become clearthat there was no better prospect of agreement on a framework for the formulation of military andair armaments than had been the case for naval armaments, Lord Cushendun was to suggest that,since the ultimate idea was that each country should put forward its own figures within the agreed framework, the Commission should recommend tothat each shouldthe various countries    i formulate and send forwardits figures as regards armament in whatever form,it thought best, dispensing with an agreed frame-work.    Sir Austen recalled that before making these instructions definite and final,  it had been thought wi.se to sound the G-oveminent of the UnitedStates.    Prom the telegrams before the Cabinet itwas cle.vr that the American Administration hadmisunderstood our proposal and had thought that we intended to invite the representatives of thevarious countries to state their programmes duringthe Geneva meeting.    A second telegram had accordingly been sent tu correct this misapprehen-sicn.   To this no reply had yet been received.Nevertheless, at the present moment the Americanattitude was very doubtful;    the official tele-grams were to a certain extent contradictory and left the Foreign Office in complete doubt as to_ Americanswhat was their intention.    Possibly the/ had notyet reached conclusions themselves .   There were two things which Sir Austen Chamberlain wished toavoid: , first, the reopening of a controversywhich.;&apos;had separated the reivesentatives of thetwo/countries at the Geneva Tripartite Conference:jand, second, that the new-Administration at
Washington should form the impression that wewere merely playing for time and did not meanbusiness.    Consequently he wished to take steps toensure an adjournment of the Naval discussion until after the meetins of the Preparatory Commissionand at the same time to satisfy the AmericanGovernment that we meant business and would in due course come forward with proposals.Sir Austen then read an extract from the&quot;Daily Mail&quot; to the effect that President Hooverwas preparing the way for an agreement with GreatBritain and that at the Geneva meeting the American delegation was likely to make proposals which would lead to a new Conference between Great Britain,Japan and the United States.    The Press Departmentof the Foreign Office had asked for instructions as to how to deal with this telegram.   He had told them to avoid making any communique but to talk toCorrespondents on the lines that we had no officialconfirmation of this information;    that the BritishGovernment had no intention itself to summon aConference of the kind suggested;    that they hadbeen studying the question for some time and had made great progress, but that it was impossible tofLL^-/ue/i^**^l make definite proposals to the United States until, ^,.the Dominions had been consulted;    although, given-jr sufficient time, they hoped to enter on discussions and were confident that agreement could be reached.This course appeared preferable either to a curtdenial of the &quot;&quot;i ily   ail&apos;s&quot; information or toignoring it.    At present, however, Sir Austen saidthat the JJoreign Office were in complete darknessas to the^American intentions.    Consequently he was
jrost anxious to obtain sore indication of tbelines on which the American Administration&apos;s mind was moving.    The Foreign Office had been informed by the American Embassy that besides Mr Gibsonand Admiral Hillary Jones, Mr Castle, an importantofficial in the State Department, was to accompany the American Delegation, though he had no informs-tion as to whether Mr Castle had yet left theUnited States.   Mr Castle had oonduotod theAff^erioan-eido-erf the successful negotiations forthe settlement of the blockade claims and was wellknown to oor officials.    In these circumstancesSir Austen wished to attach to Lord Cushendun&apos;sDelegation at Geneva Mr Oraigie, the Head of theAmerican Department of the Foreign Office.    Inordinary circumstances he would have taken thatstep without consulting the Cabinet, but at thepresent juncture he would like to have theCabinet&apos;s assent to his proposal.    His instructionsto !vir Craigie would be to minimise as far aspossible the significance of his attachment to the delegation.   He would have no authority to speak on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   He would,however, be instructed to talk as much as possible with Mr Castle and to tell him that the Governmentwere studying the question of a Naval settlement,that as Head of the American Department he wouldhave to tender his advice,  and that he would verymuch like to kno-.  vhat the Americans were thinkingabout the matter.    In fact, Mr Craigie would be instructed to seek information with a view to findingout what, was in front of us and generally to indicate to the Americans that we were anxious to work withthem and that we meant business.
THE PRITfE MINISTER, who had known Mr Graigiein Washington, said that he would be glad to see him attached to the Delegation.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said he would be glad to have Mr Graigie.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that Mr Castlewas not likely to join the American Delegation atGeneva if the only result was to be an adjournment;net-he would/wish to go home with an empty pocket;he would want some agreement in regard to naval disarmament:    and our feeling was that this couldnot be reached at Geneva.    Was there,  then, he asked,  anything which Lord Cushendun could giveMr Castle to take back with him?    There was theGerman proposal for a Sub-Gommittee, which wouldtake some tir. e, since the delegates of the variousPowers would have to return horns and consult their governments before it- met.    Then there was our ownproposal to proceed with the formulation of armamentprogrammes without a -framework.    Possibly one ofthese might satisfy Mr Castle.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY pointed out that  atthe present moment the Americans had turned downour suggestion for sending in programmes dispensingwith the framework.    No reply had yet been received to the further explanations we had offered.   Whatrather disturbed him was a telegram from Sir Esme&apos;Howard, No .174,  dated April 7th,  containing astatement of the President&apos;s views regardingdisarmament --as pablished in a United Statesne-vspaper, and which contained the following passage:-
&quot;United States is not directly concernedwith, the reduction of military forcessince those of this country have alreadybeen reduced to the minimum.   But weare concerned with Naval limitation.One of the biggest problems in Navallimitation is to find method of valuation of fighting strength.    Thisis not merely a matter of tonnage butalso 0** speed and age.    There has beena great deal of misunderstandingregarding this.If the coming Conference can find asystem of evaluating fighting strengthit &quot;ill make a major contribution to naval limitation.    The United Stateslooks forward to its success&quot;.This looked as if the American delegates meant to open up a technical discussion on questions of torsand guns c   Lord Cushendun himself was not equipped to discuss such matters in detail.THE FOBSIGN SECRETARY thought that it wouldbe useful to encourage the Americans to talkprivately on these subjects and to say what was intheir mind.    He himself was as anxious as lord cushendun to avoid detailed discussions of thesematters at the meetings of the Preparatory Commis-sion.    In order to avoid discussions in public hethought Lord Cushendun might invite the americans to discuss the questions with him in private.THE CHANCELLOR CF THE DUCHY agreed,  but thoughtthat very likely Ivlr Castle would wish to go beyond that and enter on the. discussion of details.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATIONintervened in the discussion because lie happened toknow the persons concerned.    Lord Eustace Percythought that Mr Castle was far less likely thanMr Gibson to be in a position to reflect the viewsof the President,   lit Gibson was a personal friend
to deal with confidentially,  for the reason thathe had no views of his own but merely acted as an agent ^or his Chief.    He thought, therefore,  thatMr Gibson could be trusted very ably to put thepoint of view of Mr Hoover..   Lord Eustace thoughtthat if Mr Gibson were to raise technical issuesLord Cushendun could say we were quite willingto discuss the:-; privately, but use it as an argument for postponing the discussion on Naval questionsuntil a late stage of the session of the Commission.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he would be disposed, if technical issues were raised, to saythat the suggestions were most interesting andprjma facie most hopeful, but would obviouslyrequire study.    In the hope that Mr Gibson might put forward a fruitful idea he would ask him todevelop his thesis.    Personally, however, he didnot think it likely that Mr Gibson would be in aposition to produce a definite scheme.    If heshould do so. then, in Lord Cushendun&apos;s place, hewould be inclined to say that technical questions were raised on which he must inform himself andthat he must send it home to his Government.TflE LORD PRIVY SEAL rather demurred, in theabsence of the First Lord of the Admiralty, to theuse of the word &quot;hopeful&quot;.    He believed that theAdmiralty deemed it extremely difficult to equatematters of age,  tonnage,   and so forth.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he had instructedters own Be legation to take with them a recent very helpful speech made by the First Lord of theAdmiralty at a public luncheon. He thought the telegram quoted by Lord Cushendun showed that
Mr Hoover was coming into line with the First Lordspolicy.THE CH/?TCELLOR OF THE DUCHY said that as atpresent inst&quot;ueted he was, in order to avoid a breakdown of the Preparatory Commission,  to putforward the proposal that each nation shouldformulate its programme, dispensing with an agreedframework.   He had understood that the intentionhad been as a ;-atter of courtesy to inform the americans.   In the course of the telegraphic correspondence, however,  it had slipped into theposition of our asking the Americans if theyobjected.    As a matter of fact they had objected.Up to the present time no reply had been received to our telegram giving further explanations.    Ifthe Americans were to persist in their objectionto this plan as applied to Naval Disarmament, washe to make the proposal for programmes as regardsland and air armaments?    At present we did not know whether the Americans objected to the pro-posal as  a whole or only as bearing on naval disarmament.    He desired instructions on thispoint.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said it was difficultto give exact instructions to meet everycontingency that might arise.    For his part hewould plsce the most implicit confidence in lord cushendun&apos;s judgment.    His own inclination,however, would be that if it was found that theproposal was offensive to the Americans, itshould not be made.    If, however, the Americanssaid they disliked it for the Navy but did notmind if the proposal were made for land and air
forces, he would propose it for these latter.Generally speaking, his policy would be not todo anythinc which was offensive to the American delegation.THE CHANCELLOR 0? THE DUCHY pointed out thatit might be difficult to ascertain how far thequestion was offensive to the Americans.    It wouldbe open to them to reply that our Government knewfrom their own communication from, the ambassador in Washington that they did not like the proposal.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed out that atelegram might still be received from America.Conceivably this night result in it not beingworth while to follow up the &quot;programmes&quot; proposal.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY recalled a statement in Sir Esme Howard&apos;s telegram No.170, of April 4,to the effect that the United States Governmentbelieved that if no progress was made at the forth-coming meeting, ultimate agreement might be advanced by a clear statement of the reasons forfailure rather than by an expedient that mightdisappoint the hopes of an effective reduction and limitation of armaments.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the cabinet would see from an account he was about to circ\ilateof a conversation with Signor Mussolini that thatidea corresponded closely with the latter&apos;s view.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY said that if theCommission should appear likely to reach thatunfortunate result he would have to make it clearthat a breakdown would be the cause of the utmostdisappointment to the British Government.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF EDUCATION urgedthat before that point was reached Lord Cushendunshould put forward the  &quot;programmes&quot; proposal .THE FOREIGN SECRETARY at this point read anews   telegram which had just come over from theForeign Office to the effect that Mr Gibson was reported to have left New York with preciseInstructions and perhaps with some new plan.    Itwas also indicated that the policy of the new administration was the same as that of its predecessors-c ess or and that there had been -no change sincethe Three-Power Conference at Geneva.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet hadthe utmost confidence in Lord Cushendun and thatif necessary the latter would have to telegraphfor further instructions.The Cabinet, agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster should proceed inaccordance with the instructionsalready approved, but should have full discretion in the use he madeof them according to the course ofthe proceedings at Geneva.    lord cushendun should be guided by thecircumstances of the moment as towhether, and,  if so, in what form,he should put forward the proposalfor each nation to formulate its ownarmaments programmes, dispensingwith the agreed framework:(b) To concur in the proposal of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs that he should have discre-tion to attach Mir Craigie, theHead of the American Departmentof the Foreign Office,  to the delegation accompanying lord cushendun to Geneva.

In the absence of the Chancellor of theExchequer the Prime Minister read to the cabinet a letter from Mr. Churchill recording theconclusions he had reached on certain proposalsconnected with the Budget, which had beendiscussed at the meetings on the previous day.The Cabinet agreed to Mr.  Churchill&apos;sproposals,  subject to an expression ofopinion on one point of detail, whichthe Prime Minister at once passed onin writing to the Chancellor of theExchequer.

The President of the Board of Trademade a preliminary verbal report to the Cabineton the results of the meeting of the CabinetCommittee appointed on the previous day to study the distress in the West Indies and mauritius due to the rise in the price of sugar.      The condition of these Colonies was found to be such as to necessitate some assistance.      Otherwise, before long it might become necessary to undertake reliefcomparable to that given after some greatcatastrophe,  such as an earthquake,  involvingfeeding the population.      The proposals of theCabinet Committee, however, did not involve any statement in the forthcoming Budget,moreover,  they required further explorationin consultation with the interests concerned.Sir Philip Cuniiffe-Lister said hewould circulate a report in due course.

The President of the Board of Educationmade a verbal report to the Cabinet on thequestion, which had been referred to aCabinet Committee under his Chairmanship,at the meeting referred to in the margin.Lord Eustace Percy said that the Committeehad agreed on a form of words which hecould communicate to Mr. Blundell, 11.P.,for the confidential information of the roman Catholic authorities.      He had alsosent a similar communication to theAnglican authorities and to Dr.  ScottLidgett,  representing the EvangelicalFree Churches.

He would like a few days more tocontinue his study of these questions, andhe hoped to lay the results before hiscolleagues at the next meeting of the Cabinet.In the course of the discussion,  attention was drawn to a speech made by the Attorney-General,in which he was reported to have hinted ata forthcoming extension of the system of voluntary contribution to old age pensions,for which there was no foundation in theproceedings of the Cabinet.      The PrimeMinister undertook to communicate with the attorney-General on the subject.-Whitehall Gardens, 8.7,1.11th April, 1929.
Secret, but for Cabinet if yon think well,255My dear P.M.La nuit porte conseil.     Since it is physicallyimpossible to -rive rating relief to the oanufacturersbefore October I think it will be better to leave them as they are .     The nine millions rent in the SuspensoryFund which their extra help will entail might have beenworth while making for the sake of bringing the whole scheme into action at oncej   but it is not worth whilesimply for the sake of making them a double payment inOctober.     Therefore I propose only to relieve tkeApril payments in the ease of the agricultural producer and explain why it is impossible technically to 6b theother part.     The cost of this will be about 2 millions,which can either be taken from the Suspensory Fund of22b millions or charged against the Budget surplus asthe Treasury may find most convenient.     This leaves mein a strong position on the finance of de-rating-I also propose to remit the whole of the Teaduty but to lease Goffer, Gocoa and Chicory untouched.Cost 6.2 millions, leaving a final prospective surplusof 4.1 or 2.1 according as whether the 2 millions ofagricultural relief is taken from the Budget or theSuspensory Fund.
I hope the Cabinet will like this arrangement and that nothing more will be put upon msr now.     My last few millions of surplus are not quite so robust as theearlier ones and I do not wish to place a real load ontheir shoulders -So far as your declarations oa Thursday areconcerned, I should promise definitely if we are returnedto provide a fund for Imperial development either by direct use or capitalisation:   to deal nitii maternity andto clear or re-condition the slum areas-     There is noobjection to mentioning figures even, but it should alsobe said that &quot;if responsible we shall In due coxirse malceany proposals that may be necessary to supply additional revenue*&quot;     I really cannot take any more on the Budgetas now constituted.Yours very sincerely,(Sd) WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL
