The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that he was not yet in a position tosay whether the Expert Conference on german reporation now proceeding in Paris was going tobreak down or not.   He wished to warn hiscolleagues, however, that if agree- ent wasreached there was little doubt that we shouldbe asked to surrender at any rate a portion ofthe arrears of approximately  200,000,000 due tous under the policy of the balfour Note.   Futurepayments would no doubt be satisfied, but thearrears would not be wholly covered even by annual payments by Germiany of  125,000,000 unless theindex of prosperity of Germany was brought intothe scherre and applied.     iter Churchill recalled that at the outset he had thought the summoning of the Expert Conference premature.   However, wehad accepted it and had agreed that the Expertsshould be independent.    In the circumstances he himself had not interfered in any way with thenegotiations,  in which Sir Josiah Stamp had becomeperhaps the leading figure on the Allied side..  He thought that, broadly speaking,  Sir Josiah Stampwas in agreement with the Treasury, although insome respects perhaps the Treasury took a stifferline.   Mir Churchill himself had from the beginningtaken the view that the balfour Note was ourne plus ultra, but had pointed out that arrears of payments occupied a slightly different position from future payments .   When, in conversation,Treasury officials had criticised the Experts * planfrom, the point of view of the recovery of arrears,Sir Josiah had replied rather sharply to the effect
that while everyone was prepared to criticise,nobody gave him any constructive help.Mr Churchill himself had replied that the Govern-ment were committed to no decision that went bachin the least degree on the Balfour Note, includingthe collection of arrears of payment.    It waspossible that the Conference might break down inthe e--rly future.    If, on the other hand,  agreement was reached,  the Cabinet would have a difficult decision to take.    They would be in the dilemmaof having to choose between wrecking at a veryinconvenient moment the results of the ExpertMeetings for the sake of clairs that were at &quot;34ebest of a somewhat speculative character,   ormaking further concessions which right be repre-sented as rather greater than the concessions tobe made by other countries concerned.    &apos;.r Churchillsaid that his own policy had been not in any wayto hamper the negotiators by instructions of any kind, while reserving the final decision to theGovernment.The Secretary o&quot; State for Foreign affairs thought the attitude of the Chancellor of theExchequer had been strictly correct.    Once theprinciple of independent Experts had been decided on it was necessary to respect their independence,while reserving the position of the government towards the Report,  for the production of whichthey were not in any way responsible.    The GermanGovernment had stated that they themselves hadrespected &apos;he independence of their own Experts,and this, no doubt, was true.    Nevertheless,Sir Austen Chamberlain had the impression that in
Berlin at the beginning of the week the GermanGovernment had probably taken their Expert to task,for he believed that the German Government desired the Conference to succeed.    Sir Austen doubted whether the Cabinet would have to take a definite decision before the Election.    He did not think this point was likely to be reached until theGeneral Election had reached a stage when ministers would find it impossible to proceed to Paris  forthe interchange of views which would probably follow the Conference.    For his part he thought it unlikelythat the people of this country would expect fromthe Government, or support them in, insistence onarrears of payrr ent if that would jeopardise asettlement .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hadbeen considering what action he could take to assistthe Cabinet in reaching a decision when the momentarrived.    The weakness of the Balfour Note was that,in undertaking that we should receive no more onaccount of Reparation and Allied Debts than we hadto pay to the United States, it opened the possibilities-ity of an awkward situation if one day Russia should agree to pay some part of her debts.    In thesecircumstances, if the Government did agree to acceptthe recommendations of the Expert Conference, hethought it should be made clear that its acceptanceapplied only to the countries represented at theConference and that an indication should be given .that, in the event of payments being received fromRussia, we should hold ourselves free not to include those payments within the scope of the Balfour Note.Mr Churchill said that he had asked the Treasury to
study this aspect of the question with a view tokeeping our hands free.   Any statement of ourinterpretation of the Balfour Note in this respectshould follow directly out of the changes of thesituation introduced by the Experts&apos; Report.&apos;-v Churchill then adverted to the curiousattitude of the French Government in regard tothe Debt Agreement both with Great Britain andthe United &quot;tates of America.   After describing the position in some detail he informed hiscolleagues of his intention to circulate Papersbefore the end of the week and to ask for a decision at the next Meeting o^ the Cabinet.In taking note of the statement summarised abovethe Cabinet approved the attitude which theChancellor of the Exchequer had adopted towards theBritish Experts on the Reparation Conference sitting in Paris .-4-
Lffi PROPOSED 2.    The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIaghdad-haifaI^ilhvay AND recalled that at the Meeting referred to in thefplpEL INE.margin he and the Secretary of State for the[(Previous Colonies had undertaken to look into the precisei Reference:Cabinet 17 hearing on the instructions sent to Sir William1(29), Con-elusion ij.. ) Tyrrell in connection with the question of the bagadad-Haifa Railway, of a document discoveredafter their despatch to Paris.      Sir austen chamberlain said that he and Mr. Amery had not beenable to agree as  to the degree of relevancy of thesaid document, but they had agreed as to the mannerin which we should treat with the French Government.He now proposed to drop the historical part of theMemorandum that had been sent to the british ambassador in Paris, but nevertheless he wasencouraged to believe that it would be possibleto reach a settlement.The Secretary of State for the Colonies confirmedhis agreement with the Foreign Secretary as toprocedure, adding that he was circulating amemorandum in order to set out his view of the relation of the document referred to to thegeneral course of the previous negotiations, but without wishing to raise any further discussion.
mPOLICY.elusion5.)3.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsadverted to the recommendation adopted by theCommittee       Imperial Defence on the previous(previous inference: afternoon and subsequently acted upon by theCabinet 17   -(29), Con- Secretary of &quot;&quot;tate for Foreign Affairs (.Telegram.No. 41 to Geneva) to the effect that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided to ratify the Geneva GasProtocol subject to the following reservations:-(a) His &apos;..ajesty&apos;s Government is bound by the Protocol only vis-a-vis those other States which have signed andratified the Protocol or adheredthereto:(b) His Majesty&apos;s Government ceases to be bound by the Protocol vis-a-visany enemy State whose armed forces or whose allies do not respect the protocol.Mr Amery reported that since the Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence he had received atelegram from the Canadian Government to the effectthat they concurred in the policy of ratificationsubject to similar reservations, and had sentinstructions to the Canadian Representative atGeneva.   All the Dominions, therefore, had nowconcurred, except the Irish Free State,  from whomno reply had yet been received.The Cabinet took note of the Conclusionof the Committee of Imperial defence and the action taken thereon.
83DUCTIGCT andlcitation ofjbmambnt -.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(89), Con-cTusion 3.)ANGIO-A.VFRICANRELATIONS .4. With reference to the Conclusion noted inthe rargin, the Cabinet had before the; - the follow-ing documents circulated by direction of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs:-(i) A statement by the Ron. Hugh Gibson,on behalf of the United States ofAmerica   at the Meeting of thePreparatory Commission on Disarm-ament at Geneva on April 22nd1929  (Paper C.P.-122 (29)):(ii) Lord Orshendun&apos;s statement in reply(Paper CP.-123 (29)):(iii) Draft telegraphic Instructions toLord Cushendun (Paper C.P.-120 (29)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that a great development hadtaken place within the last few days in regard tothe reduction of naval armaments .   He had circulated every document he had received onthe subject, with the exception of one telegramfrom Lord Cu shendun dated April 20th which theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had ashedshould not be circulated, having regard to the informal nature of the conversations reportedtherein and the vital importance of secrecy;and a private letter which was now almost past-history.   He had also received an additional and important telegram from Lord Cushendun that morning (No.40) which in the course of theMeetinr he read to his colleagues.Sir Austen Chamberlain said that from the outset of the present session Mr Gibson and admiral Hilary Jones had shown a friendlycommunicativeness which had not been visible on previous occasions.    Moreover, at Washington theAmerican Secretary of etate,  though not at first
-understanding the British proposals, had receivedtheir; with marked friendliness.   All the information that reached the Foreign Office was to the effectthat President Hoover was very friendly and desirednot merely a limitation but also a reduction ofarmaments.   Mr Gibson&apos;s statement at Geneva,which had been circulated,  showed that president hoover desired not merely to promote disarmamentbut to facilitate agreement between the UnitedStates of America and Great britain.   He showed aforthcoming friendliness and an attempt to under-stand and meet our particular position.    WithMr Gibson&apos;s general statement we had no cause toquarrel;    if the Americans desired reduction ofarmaments, so did we&apos;    and we equally desired thatreduction should apply to every class of ship.Neither those considerations nor the relativestrengths of navies had been the cause of pastdifferences.    The real difficulty had been as to how the categories were to be defined for purposesof limitation or reduction of naval armaments.The importance of Mr Gibson&apos;s statement was thathe brought in other considerations besides tonnage,namely, age and calibre of guns,  but not speed.But he set out to find a way to enable president hoover to concede us the/Cruisers we neededCongress that parity had been preserved.Sir Austen Chamberlain then read the text of aQuestion to be put in the House of Commons that afternoon by Commander Eenworthy, and a draft reply for which he asked the approval of theCabinet.   At a later stage, after readingTelegram No. 40 from Lord Cushendun, referred towhile p-esenting aes3s4^ sound case to
above, he added that, In vie?/ of the progress made,he proposed to withdraw the draft telegraphicinstructions to Lo . d Cushendun (Paper CP.-120 (29)),and to send instead a shorter telegram approving theaction taken by Lord Cushendun in card jr to gainWww,  and stating that, although no decision had beentaken, His Majesty&apos;s Government also were of opinionthat as soon as they were in a position to rove inthe matter the test plan would be for a cabinet minister to proceed to    ashington to discuss thewhole matter with President Hoover.    Sir austen chamberlain also described a short conversation he had had with Mr Kellogg.In the course of the discussion the First Lordof the Admiralty proposed that Admiral Kelly-should be instructed to invite confidentially theviews of the Japanese Naval Expert on Mr Gibson&apos;sproposals.    In addition, Mr Bridgeman indicated,on behalf of the Admiralty, a hopeful attitudetowards the American proposals and said that whatthe Admiralty desired in any Agreement was to beable to build as many small ships as possible.Some discussion took place as to the desirabilityof including in the Parliamentary statement a reference to the consistent desire of the BritishGovernment, as proved by their previous attitude,to achieve not only a limitation but also areduction of armaments and to apply it to everjclass of war vessel, lest this should appear todetract frojjf the credit due to the.-&quot;American initiative-tive.    In/view of the public propaganda directed against the Government in this respect, it was thought advisable&apos; to include it.
*)0 o*C o &amp;Various detailed suggestions were -^ade for modification of the text read by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.As the result of this discussion the cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the general lines ofthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s draftAnswer to be made in parliament the same afternoon, and to leave toSir Austen Chamberlain the comple-tion of the final text in accord-ance with the views expressed inthe Cabinet discussion.    (A copyof the Question and Answer isattached in the Appendix.)(b) That in lieu of the draft tele-graphic instructions to LordQushendun contained in Paper G.P.-120 (29), the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs  should informthe Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster by telegram that his desire to gain time for thetechnical discussions on r?duc-tion of naval armaments was approved,and that,although no final decision-had been taken,  the Cabinet also thought it desirable that someoneof Cabinet rank should proceed to washington after the General Elec-tion to discuss the whole questionof reduction of naval armaments with president Hoover, andXthat he &quot;was authorised to inform Mr Gibsonaccordingly.(b) That the First Lord of\the admiralty should be authorised to instructAdmiral Kelly to consult theJapanese Naval Expert at Genevaconfidentially as to his view ofMr Gibson&apos;? proposals, but at thesame time Mir Bridgem^n should tellAdmiral Kelly to keep in the closest touch with Lord Cushendun.
5      With reference to the Conclusion noted inthe margin,  the Cabinet had under consideration the Report of the Cabinet Comriittee appointed to(Previous consider whether the emergency caused in certain reference:Cabinet 16 British sugar-producing Colonies by the fall in(29), Con-clusion 3.) sugar prices was such as to render desirable thegrant o^ an increase of Imperial Preference on sugar (Paper C.P.-111 (29)).The Conclusions reached by the Committee were as follows :-(i) It appears certain in the case ofMauritius and probably in the casesof Barbados, British Guiana and certain of the smaller West Indian Islands,, that,if no action is taken,  the BritishGovernment will before long have tomake substantial grants for the main-tenance of the Governments of thoseColonies and the relief of their inhab-^itants comparable with the grants-in-aidwhich would be necessary after someearthquake or other catastrophe.(ii) Whatever the form of financial helpnow given, there must always be some risk that further assistance in otherways may have to be given later.(iii)  The most economical and defensibleexpedient would seem to be a temporary increase in the sugar preference toenable the undertakings to remain atwork.   An increase in the preference of 1/-s . per cwt. would still leavethe planters to bear some portion oftheir losses and they would thus havestrong inducement to add to the efficient-ency of their undertakings.The cost of increasing the&apos; preference by 1/-s.a cwt. was estimated at about  900,000 in a fullye?.r, and in the event of this increase beingapproved the Committee recommended that negotia-tions with the interests concerned should be under-taken forthwith, but that any. announcement of theGovernmentTs decision should be deferred until thetime of the introduction of the Second Finance Bill,after the Genera&apos;1 Election.p^pERlALPREFERENCE .Sugar.-1 1-
-1 2r-The Cabinet a? so had. before then a herorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-118 (29))  covering a Minute by the Eoard of customs and Excise indicating various serious objections to the committee s proposals and suggesting that a policy of leans or grants toMauritius and the West Indies might be a more economical snd defensible expedient than anincrease in the preference, and that it might be easier to enforce inproverent of the 3ugarindustry in those Colonies by attaching conditions to a loan or grant than by giving the increasedpreference.   In his Memorandum the Chancellor ofthe exchequer stated that it would be a mostunusual departu&quot; e for the British Government toundertake to provide funds for the relief of aparticular industry in a well-established andfinancially independent Colony,  and that therewould be no adequate means of securing, by meansof control exercised from this country, that  theconditions proposed to be attached to the sug^stedloans or grants were effectively fulfilled,The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged thatit was unnecessary to take a decision beforethe General Election.      In the course of thediscussion the view was expressed that thenegotiations with the sugar refiners need noton this occasion take &quot;very long,  so that thedelay involved in postponement Y/ould not bevery great.The Cabinet agreed -
(a) That some action would berequired in the near future toassist the Colonies in question;v..  that the most satisfactory way of doing this would be by keeping the sugar industry alive,and that the decision should be postponed until after theGeneral Election;(b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should instruct the Chairman ofthe Board of Inland Revenue to study the question further, and,on the assumption that it was theintention of the Cabinet toproceed by the method of anadditional preference on Empiresugar,   to advise what was theleast objectionable method ofcarrying this out, but not toplace himself in .communicationwith the sugar refiners or any authorityoutside the Government;(c) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should in the meanwhileexamine the various alternative methods of assisting the colonies in question,  which could be adoptedIf the difficulties with the sugarrefiners were deemed to be too&quot;great to proceed by means of anadditional preference on Empiregrovm sugar.
0hh ALLOW-IaXation of.(previous reference:Cabinet 44(25), Con-elusion 9 .)-?AY OP THEFIGHTINGservices.(previous reference:Cabinet if(27), Gon-clusion 5) .6. The Cabinet had before then; Memoranda by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Papers CP.-76 (29)  and CP.-95 (29))on the subject of the liability of certain naval officers to taxation in respect of Lodging and servants&apos;  Allowances.    The Mem.ora.ndum of the FirstLord of the Admiralty,  after explaining the natureof the grievance of the Naval Officers, suggestedthat&apos; oithoar/ the question should be referred to theLaw Officers with a view to equal and just treatmentof all concerned, or^Dha-t Naval Officers should befreed from liability to taxation, at an annual costto the revenue of about  15,000.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer&apos;s Memorandum emphasized the impossibleity of forgoing tax in cases where there is a strongpresumption of legal liability and payment has beenhabitually made.    The Government would be bound bythe opinion of the Law Officers, which would probablybe to the effect that the present basis of the taxation of the emoluments of Officers of the three fighting Services should be substantially widened.Very considerable sums might be involved (particularlyin the. case o^ Amy Officers) and the situation might1 become so serious as to call for legislation of anacutely controversial character.    In these circum-stances the Chancellor deprecated any action beingtaken in regard to the Naval Allowances anomaly.In the course of the discussion various proposals, were made for adjusting the positionof naval officers in this matter, such as, forexample, a compensatory increase in theirallowances,  or alternatively,  the insertion ofa clause in the Finance Bill which would legaliseAh-
beyond doubt the exemption of Army and Air force officers from income tax in respect of theseallowances,  and at the same time extend  it     tothe Navy.      This latter proposal was favourablyreceived, but the Cabinet felt that tire subject should be explored in greater detail in view ofthe possibility of reactions elsewhere from any decision taken.The Cabinet agreed  That the whole question should be remitted to the Committee on the pay of the Fighting Services,  ofwhich the Secretary of State forScotland is  the Chairman, who should report to the Cabinet indue course.
CIVIL-SERVICE.remuneration of &quot;P&quot; ClassClerks and?eniporary MaleClerks .(previous reference:Cabinet 3(29),  Con-elusion 3.)7.   The Cabinet had before their a treasury memorandum  (Paper C.P.-116 (29)), circulated by direction of the Chancellor o^ the Sxchenuer,relative to claims submitted by the Associationof ex-Service Civil Servants and the Civil ServiceConfederation fo - a substantial increase of remuneration payable to &quot;P&quot; Class Clerks, an ex-Service grade of permanent non-pensionableGovernment employees.   After pointing out that theinc ease o^ remuneration claimed on behalf of the&quot;P&quot; Clerks would also have to be extended to the&quot;P.U.&quot; and temporary Male Clerks and would, ifconceded,  in that event amount to  1,758,000 perannum, the    emo&quot;-andum set out the arguments againstand in favour of some concession,  and stated thatthe Treasury and the Departments concerned had reached the unanimous conclusion that in all thecircumstances an agreed settlei^ent should, ifpossible, be reached with the Associations on thebasis of an offer to extend the scales of Grade iiiClerks (&quot;P&quot;,   &quot;P.U.&quot; and Temporary) by  three annualincrements of 2s.6d. a week,  the scales of Gzade iiClerks in the intermediate centres and provincesby three increments o&apos; 2s.Sd. a week, and the scales of Grade IT Clerks in the London area byone increment of 5/-s a week.   On the basis of present numbers it is estimated that these proposals would involve an ultimate extra expenditure of 350,000 per annur, but this amount would be offset by any reduction of numbers which may prove possible
The Cabinet agreed -(a) That an attempt should be madeto reach final settlement onthe terms proposed by theTreasury and the Departmentsconcerned, as summarised above;(b) That if a permanent settlement could not be reached on these terms the matter should bebrought back to the Cabinet.

As a matter of urgency,  and. in view of aforthcoming Betate in the House of Lords, thequestion was raised as to what was the policy ofthe Government towards the acceptance of Article 36of the Statute of the Permanent Court of Inter-national Justice, providing for the compulsorysubmission of certain classes of cases to the court the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that up till now the policyof all Parties that had held office had been thatif we did sign the optional clause it must be withreservations .   He recalled that the matter had beenconsidered at the Imperial Conference, 1926.While the widest possible acceptance of the methodof arbitration as a settlement of international disputes had been universally favoured,  the feelinghad been that it was premature to accept the ocli-gations under the Article in question.    A general understanding had been reached that none of theGovernments represented at the Imperial conference would take any action in the direction of theacceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the^ -ins JSPermanent Court without bring/the matter up forfurther discussion.    He thought&quot;it desirable totake the view that the above understanding wasnot for all time, but that the members of theBritish Empire should all act together, and that.the matter ought to be discussed at--the nextImperial Conference.   This view was generally accepted.
TH3 POLITICALSITUATION.anergencyOrganisation.(previous reference:Cabinet 56[2k), Con-clusi on 1) .9.    In accordance with the precedentadopted at the previous G-eneral Election(see marginal reference)  the Cabinet agreed -That the Lord Chancellor, togetherwith any Ministers who mightbe readily available shouldhenceforward and during theGeneral Election advise thePrime Minister and their colleagues as to the answers to be given toquestionnaires put to Parliamentarycandidates by various organisations,and generally on any other mattersof Government policy that might beraised during the period of theGeneral Election.      The following ministers indicated that theywould probably be within reach of London:-The Lord Privy Seal,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of Stare for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The President of the Board of Trade,
SCOTLAND.Migrationfr0r ireland (previous reference:Cabinet 10(29),  Oon-clusion 7 .)-t(*all Gardens2UhApril,  1929.10.   The Cabinet further considered the questionof Irish migration to Great Britain, and in pursv-ance oT the Conclusion noted in the margin had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs  (Paper CP.-109 (29))relative to the possible deportation of persons of Iri3h Free State origin who become charged to public  funds in this country.The Memorandum in question stated that therewould be no objection,  so far as the Articles ofAgreement are concerned, to deportation legislationprovided it was general in terms.   While it wasvery questionable whether&apos; any case had been made out for violating the existing principle that all british subjects of whatever origin are free toenter and reside in the United Kingdom, agreedlegislation for the mutual repatriation as betweenthe Irish Free ?tate and the United Kingdom ofpersons who have become a public charge under thepre-Treaty conditions, would not violate that principle, and proposals for legislation on theselines was under consideration by the Free StateGovernment.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs undertook to press President Cosgrave to takeearly action, and he did not dissent from theview of the Secretary of State for Scotlandthat Parliamentary candidates should be put ina position to state that if agreement on thesubject could not be reached with the Governmentof the Irish Free State, His Majesty&apos;s government intended to introduce legislation on this matter.S.W.1.-20-
APPENDIX.COPY OF PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION AND ANSWER.APRIL 24th,   1929.LIEUTENANT-COZANDER KEN.&apos;.wellworthy,  - To ask the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, whether his attention hasbeen called to the speech of the United States principalrepresentative at Geneva,  Mr. Gibson, on 22nd April last,in which he declared that his government was prepared toagree to any reduction in naval armaments, however drastic,so long as It does not leave any category of war vesselunrestricted;    and what response is to be made to thisrenewed Invitation on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN,  - Yes,  Sir.      His Male sty fsGovernment have,  of course, noted the important statement made by Mr. Gibson in the Preparatory Commission on disarmament.     As was at once stated by my noble Friend,Lord Cushendun, His Majesty&apos;s Government share to thefull the hopes and wishes of the Government of the UnitedStates as therein set forth.His Majesty&apos;s Government equally with the Governmentof the United States desire not merely a limitation buta reduction of naval armaments.     They have indeedthemselves made proposals for such general reduction andthat the reduction should be applied to every class ofwar vessel.As between ourselves and the United States suchdifference as has hitherto existed has not been concernedwith these great principles nor with the relative strengthof our respective Navies, but with the determination ofthe categories into which ships of war should be divided.On this point His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted with much interest the new criteria suggested by Mr. Gibson.They attach great importance to the possibilities openedby the greater elasticity given by his suggestions forthe adjustment of the agreed naval strengths to thedifferent circumstances of the two Powers.     Finally, they desire me to take this opportunity to express their warmappreciation of the cordial and conciliatory spirit shown by the American delegation and to give the assurpnce on thebehalf that it is in the same spirit and with the mostearnest wish to reach complete agreement that they will consider the American suggestions.
