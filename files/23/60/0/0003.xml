1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (Paper CP.-12(29)) covering (i) a telegram from the Governmentof India containing an appreciation of thepolitical situation in the light of meetings which the various political organisations have held, according to custom, during the Christmasperiod, and (ii)  a private letter from theViceroy on the same subject.    These documentsindicated that in the view of the Governmentof India the political situation had swungconsiderably to the Left in the last year.In his Memorandum Lord Peel stated that he hadno doubt that a successful prosecution of aconsiderable number of Communist leaders underthe existing law for conspiracy would be themost effective action against them, but that an unsuccessful prosecution would be very damaging to the Government, and that he was impressingupon the Government of India the necessity ofclosely examining the prospects of success beforelaunching a prosecution, and the importance of taking further powers to deal with the leadersof such movements.The Secretary of State for India summarised the documents referred to above, and added thatwhile it was true that the atmosphere wasincre?singly unfavourable, the growing agitationmust in some measure be attributed to the desireto discredit in advance the Report of the SimonCommission.    Similar tactics had been adopted at the time of the Montagu-Chelmsford proposals.In the course of the discussion which followed,two considerations were emphasized:-
( i) The importance of the Governmentof India refusing to be hustledinto making concessions fundament-ally unsound, and of giving theViceroy every support in maintain-ing this attitude:(ii) The desirability, in any trialfor conspiracy, of selectingonly those leaders against whom there was a strong case, and of leaving other doubtful offendersalone.
INDIA.Proposed Dutyon Ootton^Piec e Goods .(previous reference e:Cabinet 54(25), Con-elusion 9 .)2. Arising out of the foregoing discussion,the President of the Board of Trade called attention to the proposal of the Government ofIndia to include in their Dudget an increasedrevenue duty of 1% per cent, on cotton piecegoods.   Whatever might be the precise effect ofthis increase   and it would certainly have some   it would have psychological and politicaleffects of a serious character in Lancashire,where manufacturers were having to face enormoussacrifices in reconstructing the cotton trade.The Secretary of State for India stated thatthere was a prospective deficit in the Indianrevenue of between  600,00 0 and  700,000, andthat there were alternative ways of meeting the deficit, such as an increase in the Sugar Duty,which he had pressed upon the Government of India.But the Cotton Duty was very popular in India.He was in daily telegraphic coirmunication withthe Government of India;   he had consulted thePrime Minister on the matter and had conveyed tothe Viceroy the Prime Minister&apos;s view of the disastrous effects which might follow in Lancashireif the Cotton Duty were increased.Dealing with the powers which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could resort to if the conflictcontinued, the Secretary of State pointed out that,in the case of a revenue tariff such as was nowproposed,  it was open to him to refuse to agreeto the Indian Budget.   This would be a formal and serious act which would arouse acute politicalstrife .
After a full discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a)  That  it was most undesirable,for commercial and for political reasons, that the increase ofrevenue duty on cotton piece goods should be imposed at the presenttime:(t) That, without prejudging in anyway the policy of Fis Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the event of theGovernment of India persistingin their policy and refusing toadopt any of the available alter-natives, and while fully sympathis-ing with the Viceroy&apos;s fiscaldifficulties, the Secretary ofState should inform&apos; the viceroy of the deep anxiety of the Cabineton this question:    their earnestdesire that every effort should bemade to avoid the increase of duty, and their fear that itsimposition might engender a conflict between the two Govern-ments, inflame opinion hereimmediately before the Election,and generally prejudice theprospects of an amicable settle-ment of the much graver constitu-tional issues pending between thetwo countries.-4-
EQUAL PAY -FORMEN AND women in THE CIVILSERVICE.(l?r previous reference:Cabinet 47(28),  Con-elusion 6.)3, The Cabinet had before them a Note by the -Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-8 (29))covering a Treasury Memorandum on the subject of equal Pay for Men and Women in the Civil Service,and also a Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Education (Paper C.F.-15 (29)) explaininghow the demand for equal pay for men and womenaffects the teaching profession.After briefly recapitulating the recent historyof the question the Treasury Memorandum estimatedthat, allowing for the extension of the principle to worren teachers, the cost of the proposal wouldbe at least  10,000,000 a year;    that a decisionto give equal pay to men and women in the CivilService and the teaching profession could hardly fail to react on industrial wages standards;    andthat if women were given menTs rates of pay a newagitation would almost inevitably arise for thegrant to married men of marriage allowances.For these reasons it was urged that the demand fora Select Committee to consider and report on themeans for giving effect to the principle of equal pay should be firmly resisted, on the ground thatin the present state of the national finances theGovernment could not contemplate the heavy additional burden involved in the application ofthe principle.In his Memorandum the President of the Boardof Education stated that there was no force behind the demand for equal pay in the teaching profes-sion and that it was clear that any attempt toapply the principle at the present moment would be strongly resented both by the Local Authoritiesand by the National Union of Teachers.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer read a draftanswer to the second part of House of CommonsQuestion 68 down  for the 31st January,  1929,which rejected, by implication, the demand forSelect Committee.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposed answerby the Treasury on the questionof Equal Pay, which read asfollows:-His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave given renewed consid-eration to this question in view of representationsrecently made on the subject.They have, however, found itimpossible to depart from thedecision already announcedboth by this and by the late3overnment that the present state of the country&apos;sfinances will not admit ofthe great increase of expen-diture involved in the appli-cation of the principle of equal pay for men and women in the Civil Service.(b) To ask the Minister of Labour, inconsultation with the Treasury, toprepare a statement showing theprobable full financial effect ofthe application of the principleof equal pay for equal work.(c) To ask the Minister of Labour to circulate to the Cabinet a Memo-randum showing the extent to which,since the War, women had supplantedmen in employment.
4. With reference to the precise nature of the inquiry which it was proposed should be held intothe question of th^ suggested construction of aChannel Tunnel, the Prime Minister brieflyindicated the procedure he had under considera-tion and undertook to deal more fully with thesubject at a future Meeting of the Cabinet.
E WASHINGTON 5.    The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumURS CONVEN-ON. by the Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-17 (29))relative to the question of the revision of thereviouseference: Washington Hours Convention.      In this Memorandumabinet \28), Con- the Cabinet were informed that at the nextlusion ?).)Session of the    Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office,  to be held on the 11th and 12thof March,  1929,   that Body will be called uponto decide whether or not there is a prima faciecase for the revision of the Convention.      Aftersummarising the difficulties and dangers of theposition,  the Minister of Labour suggested(i)   that the Government should maintain theirpolicy of pressing for the revision of theWashington Convention;    and (ii)   that every possible step should be taken, both by preparing theground beforehand and by the adoption of suitablemeasures at the meeting itself,  to secure adecision in favour of the British contentions.In the course of the discussion reference wasmade to the recent Debate in the House of Lordswhen His Majesty&apos;s Government were urged to specify in detail the points which,  in their view, wasiranted the demand for revision.      It wassuggested that these might be prepared by a departmental Committee of the Ministry of Labour,  theBoard of Trade and the Foreign Office, but theMinister of Labour said that the list of points was already known and that in consequence he did notthink a Departmental Committee was necessary.The Cabinet were informed that the Minister ofLabour was considering the question whether on this occasion he should be present himself at the discussion in Geneva.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thathe would communicate with our Amhassaclorsif the Ministerof Labour would draft the kind of communication which he desired him to send, and that if the Minister of Labourdecided to go himself to Geneva the Secretary of state would notify our Ambassadors  that His Majesty&apos;s government attached so much importance to this matter that theMinister of Labour was going to Geneva for the Conferenceand would be glad of opportunities of consisting therepresentatives of other foreign Governments who were members of the Governing Body.The Cabinet approved theproposals of the Ministerof Labour.

DRAFT.83feCRET.Dear Sir,I have, received your letter of. the 31st Decemberwith regard to the present position of the Iron and SteelIndustry.      I need hardly say that I ^ind myself in fullsympathy with many o^ the opinions to which you have givenexpression.      The condition o^ the Iron and Steel Industryis a matter of concern to the nation as a whole, and Itis on that account that I welcome all the more yourstatement that its affairs ought to be examined rather ^romthe economic standpoint, than as a matter or political controversy.In your letter you ask that the Government should consider the setting up of a Royal Commission or othercompetent committee to make a full and impartial inquiry into the Industry.      Before I deal with that request I think ought to invite your attention to certain relevant facts.Firstly, the Committee on Industry and Trade, now sittingunder the Chairmanship of Sir Arthur Balfour, has alreadypresented a detailed report on the iron and steel industryand this report deals at length with some of the matters referred to in your letter     and that Committee will shortly be presenting its ^finally report.Secondly, the Government by the exemption from stampBs amended xppy Section   duty granted by Section 53       the Finance Act of 1927ill o^ theFinance has given a practical encouragement to amalgamations in thisJet, 1923.and other industries.Thirdly, In framing the Rating Reform Scheme, thef Government has paid particular attention to the needs of iron and Steel, and the reliefs under that Scheme - both from the point or view of rates and railway freights - arePugh, Esq.,The Iron &amp; Steel Trades Confederation,76, Swinton Street, W.C.1.
designed and calculated to be of especial benefitto this particular industry.      Lastly, it is the policy the Conservative Government, if returned to power, toallow the Iron and Steel Industry to make an applicationunder the Safeguarding of Industries procedure, and thus to have an opportunity then of stating its case before anIndependent tribunal.      In this connection I observe thatin your letter of* the 31st December yrvu express thedesire that any inquiry should have special referenceto the nature of the competition in the home market.It is in the light of these pacts that I must examine therequest which you have made to me.As regards your suggestion of a Royal Commission,this would not in my view be the most effective method ofprocedure, because Inquiry by means of a Royal Commissionmust Inevitably involve delays which might be obviatedif a more simple and more expeditious method were adopted;    and it is obviously unnecessary that any inquiry should traverse again all the ground so recentlycovered by the Bal^our Committee.Regarding the suggestion that other aspects of theproblem should be referred to a Committee of Inqiiiry,it is plain that a Committee o-f the character suggestedby you woiild necessarily cover, to a very large extent,the same ground as would be covered by any Committee of inquiry under the Safeguarding procedure, which might be claimed by the Industry after the General Election inaccordance with the declared policy of the Government; andit would clearly be impossible to have two Committeessitting at the same time with overlapping functions.;On the other hand, I cannot fail to be impressed by the representations which you, speaking on behal^ of allthe Trade Unions engaged in this Industry, have made
to me concerning the avoidance of any unnecessarydelay.      As yoii know I am precluded from bringing theIron and Steel Industry within the scope of the Safe -guarding Scheme during the lifetime of the present parliament.      Ir, however, both sides engaged in theindustry, both the Employers&apos; Organisations and yourConfederation, unite in requesting an investigationon behalf of the industry as a whole,  I feel that Ishould be  justified in taking exceptional action and Ishould be prepared to consider favourably theappointment of an ad hoc Committee, whose function itwould be to hold an inquiry with specie! reference tothe following points:-   The state of unemployment in theindustry,  the efficiency of the industry and its capacity to increase its present output and employ moreworkers,  the nature and volume of the foreign competition with which it is faced,  the extent to which that competitioncomes from countries where wages or other conditions areinferior to our own, and whether the imposition of a dutyon foreign imports would be beneficial to the Industry,and if so the rate and range of duty suggested andwhether the imposition of such a duty would exert aseriously adverse effect on employment or cost ofproduction in any other industry Including agriculture.Any industry seeking to oppose a duty on these grounds, would of course be entitled to appear beforethe Comma, t tee (as under the Safeguarding Procedure).The appointment of such a Committee would be tantamount to an acceleration of the SafeguardingInquiry to which I have already referred, but a body with such terms of reference would, nevertheless, In my view, be able to direct its attention to the principalpoints which have been erauaerated by you as deservingof special consideration, and would at the same time-3-
idSAbe the most expeditious method o^ achieving theresult which you desire.
