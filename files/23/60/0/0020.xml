THE KING&apos;S 1. The Cabinet had before them a draft of the speech.King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament(Previous (paper C.P.-140 (29)), submitted to them by the reference:Cabinet 49 Lord Chancellor.(28), Con-cluflion 18 After examining the draft Speech paragraph byand Appendix.)paragraph, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the paragraphs in square bracketson pages 3 and 4 should be omitted,since they referred to comparativelyremote events, such as the ImperialConference of 1926 and the ColonialOffice Conference of Governors in1927.(b) That the paragraph on page 3 beginning&quot;In pursuance of the recommendationsof the Imperial Conference of 1926*should be re-drafted in order-to clear up a slight ambiguity at theend of the sentence.(c) Page 5:    re-draft the second para-graph so as to read as follows:-&quot;I have given My assent to themeasures embodying the compre-hensive scheme which has been before you for relieving agri-culture and other productiveindustries from the burden ofrates, for the re-organisationof local government and for thereadjustment of the financial relations between the State andthe local authorities.    Themeasure of relief in respect ofrailway freights which it hasbeen possible to give in respectof selected industrial and agricultural traffics in anticl-pation of the general scheme has proved of value.    It is a hopefulaugary of the greater and more widespread benefits that shouldaccrue, particularly to the basictrades whose conditions are leastsatisfactory, when the full schemeof relief takes effect&quot;.(d) Page 5, last paragraph:   For. thethird word, &quot;anticipate&quot;, put &quot;are confident&quot;.(e) Page 6:    The second paragraph should begin &quot;Steady progress continues&quot;.(f) Fourth paragraph:    Omit the referenceto a Bill for facilitating the re-construction of weak bridges.

The Secretary of State for War, as Chairmanof the Cabinet Committee set up by the terms ofi-previous reference: the Conclusion referred to in the margin, made aSatinet 19(29), Con- verbal report on the result of his Committee^elusion 2.)inquiries.   After reading the Report of the Inter-Departmentel Committee of Civil Servants onUnemployment (Paper CP.-104 (29)), which had considered Mr Lloyd George&apos;s pamphlet &quot;We can conquerUnemployment&apos;&apos; , the Cabinet Committee had reachedthe conclusion that a large part of the Report couldnot be published without detriment to the CivilService.    There were certain portions of the Report,however, dealing with roads, public health, labour,and the financial aspects of the scheme, which theCommittee considered might with advantage bepublished under the authority of the Ministers ofTransport, Health and Labour, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.      Sir Laming Worthington-Evans addedthat at this point the Committee had asked theMinister of Labour to consider the arrangements forgiving effect to their conclusions.    If the cabinet approved their proposals the Committee^ idea wasthat a Private Question to the Prime Minister shouldbe put on the Order Paper for Wednesday, May 8th,and that a reply should be given to the effect thata White Paper would be published composed of fourdocuments issued under the orders and responsibilityof the Ministers to whom he had referred.In approving the above proposals the cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Labour shouldmake arrangements for a question to be addressed to the Prime Minister,as proposed, on Wednesday, May 8th:
(b) That in the reply to the question in Parliament it should be nn.declear that, in the interests ofthe Civil Service, no Expert report could be presented to Parliament,but that a V^hite Paper would be laidcontaining material issued under theorders and responsibility of thefoliov ing Minis t e rs: -The Minister of Transport,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour,The Chancellor of the Exchequer:to whom the Cabinet added the Postmaster-General.(c) That all the arrangements for carryingout the above decision should be inthe hands of the Minister of Labour.
3.     The Cabinet had before them a draft of thePrice Minister&apos;s Election Address, prepared by thEmergency Business Committee presided over by theLord Chancellor (Paper C.P.-141 (29)).As the draft was only circulated duringthe meeting of the Cabinet, it was examinedparagraph by paragraph, with a view to ensuring that it contained no statement of government policy with which Members of the Cabinet v/erenot in agreement.     As a result of this examination,  the dUaft statement was approved in its broad lines and subject to suchalterations of detail as the Prime minister might decide to.incorporate, subject to thefollowing:-(a) Page 1(a).  THE EMPIRE.    Line 4:    For the penultimate word &quot;it&quot; put &quot;them&quot;.Line J:    Omit the vrords &quot;in it&quot;.(b) Page 5: COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT.

APPENDIX.The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.May 10, 1929.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons:MY relations with Foreign Powers continue to be friendly. &apos;    - &apos;The negotiations for My participation in the multilateral Treaty for theRenunciation of War in the form proposed by the Government of the United states were successfully concluded on the 2nd March last when My ratifications of thisinstrument in respect of all parts of My Empire were deposited in Washington.-&apos;i, I have entrusted My Son, the Duke of Gloucester, with the Mission of conferringtlie Insignia of the Order of the Garter upon the Emperor of Japan as a token of Myhigh regard for His Imperial Majesty, and as a pledge of the friendship which unitesOur two countries in their determination to co-operate for the peaceful settlement ofinternational questions, both in the Ear East and in the world at large.I hope that events in China will continue to show improvement and gradualprogress towards more stable conditions. I am glad that it has been possible for full recognition to be accorded to the National Government established at Nankingand for My Government to conclude with them a Treaty recognising the principle of complete tariff autonomy., Owing to the uncertain situation in Afghanistan and the absence of a settledGovernment, My Representative was withdrawn from Kabul at the end of February.It is My earnest hope that internal peace may soon be restored and a government established acceptable to the people generally with which My Government will beable to resume the friendly intercourse of the past. ;My Government have continued to press for the reduction of armaments inconsultation with other Governments at Geneva. New hope of an early settlementof the question of further naval disarmament has recently been given by the speech of the United States delegate there, of which My Government were not slow toexpress their appreciation.My Government have announced their intention of taking the necessary action to enable Me to accept, subject to reciprocity, the Protocol prohibiting chemicaland bacteriological methods of warfare. All My Governments in My Dominionshave announced a similar intention.The seven members of your two Houses, to whom, eighteen months ago, I issued a Commission to enquire into the working of the existing system of government inIndia, have now completed the first part of their task. They have visited India:twice bo- acquire information and collect evidence for the purpose of their enquiry.They have enjoyed the co-operation of Committees of Provincial Legislatures, as wellas that of a Committee of members of the Central Legislature who, at the invitation of My Government, will be associated with them also in the final stages of theirenquiry. There lies before them, to complete their arduous task, the duty of framinga Report which, when drawn, will be presented to the Parliament at that time&apos;assembled.   I pray that success may crown their labours.In pursuance of the recommendations of the Imperial Conference of 1926,arrangements have been made for the meeting in London in October next of an&apos;Expert Committee on the Operation of Dominion Legislation, consisting of repre-sentatives of My Governments, and for the holding of a Sub-Conference on MerchantShipping Legislation.Members of the House of Commons :19267
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The number of persons unemployed in certain industries during the past year has continued to cause anxiety, but a substantial improvement has taken place andthere are good grounds for the belief that we are moving towards a higher level ofemployment in all parts of the country. The re-organisation of industry, and its development in new directions, are steadily proceeding and, with continued co-operation and goodwill between employers and workers, will lay the foundation for a lasting improvement. It is clear, however, that owing to the altered needs ofindustry a redistribution of workers must take, place on a large scale and it hasbeen the policy of My Ministers to aid and guide this movement by schemes oftraining and transference. &apos;&apos;1&apos;I have given My assent to the measures embodying the comprehensive schemewhich has been before you for relieving agriculture and other productive industriesfrom the burden of rates, for the re-organisation of local government and for there-adjustment of the financial relations between the State and the local authorities.The measure of relief in respect of railway freights which it has been possible togive in regard to selected industrial and agricultural traffics in anticipation of thegeneral scheme has proved of value. It is a hopeful augury of the greater arid more widespread benefits that should accrue, particularly to the basic trades whoseconditions.are least satisfactory, when the.full scheme of relief takes effect.. I have given My assent to a measure providing that in the case of agriculturethis relief from rates shall come into force immediately.My Ministers are confident that the reforms in local government, which includerecommendations made by My commission on Local Government, and the re-organisa-tion of the financial relations between the State and the local authorities will promote efficiency and economy in local administration, will enable better provision to be made for the health and welfare of the people, and will in particular directspecial relief to those areas whose needs are most pressing..,; Steady progress- continues to be made in the provision of houses, ,and the reductions in costs which are being secured&apos; should materially facilitate the erection of houses for the less well-paid members of the community.My Ministers have initiated an enquiry into the radium requirements of thecountry in the light of the knowledge and experience gained as to the importance ofradium in the. treatment of- cancer, and in accordance with the recommendationmade to them they have agreed to contribute to a fund for the acquisition of a stock of radium. It is My earnest hope that this action may prove a substantial step forward in the campaign against one &quot;of the most distressing maladies known tomankind.I have given My assent to a Bill effecting a consolidation of the law as to companies.A Bill has also been passed which, it is hoped, will assist the further developrment of the gas industry.    ......       .: ......Measures have been passed for the reform of Local Government in Scotlandand for granting substantial relief from the burden of rates to agricultural,industrial and freight-transport, lands and heritages., Provision has also been made to increase the available facilities for the supplyof credit to the agricultural industry in Scotland, , &apos;       HThe Scottish Departments of Health, Agriculture, Prisons and other Depart-ments have been re-organised in accordance with the terms of the Re-organisation of offices (Scotland) Act of last Session. . -In bidding you farewell, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours. &apos;. !
