GERMANY.Evacuation ofthe Rhine-land-(previous reference:Cabinet 2(29), Con-clusion 1. )1. The Se-cre-tary- of State for Foreign affairs recalled that on January 23rd the Cabinet had authorised him, if he so desired, to oonmunicateto M. Briand a scheme, drawn up in the ForeignOffice, for Verification and Conciliation in the rhineland after the date of evaouation by theAllies in the late War.    After careful considera-tion Sir Austen Chamberlain had oome to the conclu-sion that the Foreign Office scheme would require some modification and that the moment was notopportune for an   initiative on his part.M. Briand had communicated his own plan to dr.  Stresemann and Sir Austen some 48 hours beforethe Meeting of the Council of the League ofIShtions.    Dr.  Stresemann had only read it after his arrival in Geneva.    For various reasons, which included the attitude   of Parties in the GermanReichstag, the German Foreign Minister had saidthat he could not discuss the question at present,and in consequence no important discussions hadtaken place between the Foreign Ministers ofGreat Britain, France and Germany during therecent Meeting of the Council at Geneva.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he did not wish to circulate M. Briandlsproposals at the present time as they had been communicated unofficially and were not at alllikely to be adopted in their present form.    he undertook, however, to communicate a copy for thestrictly personal information of the Secretaryof State for War, in view of his special interestin the question.
Jthe permanentkoiTRT of(internationali justice atfTHB HAGUE.possibleAmericanParticipation2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that Mr Elihu Root had arrived at Geneva,on the invitation of the League of Nations, totake part in a Committee of Jurists summoned toconsider what amendments should he made to theStatute of the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice at The Hague.    Sir Austen Chamberlainreminded the Cabinet that some time ago theAmerican Government had approached the League ofNations with proposals for their participation in the Permanent Court.    The League of Nations,however, had not been able to accept the condi-tions on which American adherenoe was proposed.Sir Austen Chamberlain himself had taken the leadcu^A^ flu. U.S. f\.in proposing to the League that 47 Powers^ shouldbe invited to meet in oonference^in ordor tj)jiiiyand reach agreement in regar^-tror^trEe amendments to be iiHdeto^^th^^sTatute of the. Permanent Court.A%a 3!$rs-t the American Government had declined toparticipate, on the ground that they had already stated their position.    About a fortnight ago,however, Mr Kellogg had issued a Note to thePowers, couched in very friendly terms in regardto the League of Nations, in which he had statedthat he did not wish in any way to obstruct the delicate work of the Council, but that he hopedthat by means of negotiation it might be possibleto reach agreement in regard to American partici-pation.    On his journey to Europe, Mr Elihu Roothad worked out some proposals with the objeot of reconciling the views of the League with thedesiderata of the Senate.   Mr Root had told him
that M. Briand and Dr.  Stresemann were preparedto accept his proposals.    In these circumstancesSir Austen had given instructions to Sir CecilHurst, the British Representative on the LeagueCommittee , that he was to do his utmost to reach agreement on this subject,- although there was one point on which the Lord Chancellor (whom he had consulted) had insisted rather strongly that sir Cecil Hurst was not to agree without referringhome.After hearing some particulars of the Britishand American attitude, the Cabinet approved thegeneral instructions given by Sir austen chamberlain to Sir Cecil Hurst.
TREATMENT OP 3.  The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsMINORITIES.reported to the Cabinet that the Poles had atone time announced their intention to propose aGeneral Convention to bind all the Powers con-cerned in Minorities.    This had been intended asa counter to certain proposals by Dr. Stresemann.The one Power, however, that had no objection was Germany, who no longer had any/minoritiesAwithin the territories of the Reich.    Sir austen chamberlain had told the Poles that he would give no support to their proposals , and had kept theDominions Office informed.    He had also obtained the approval of the Prime Minister to the line hewas taking.
THE ROMANQUESTION.(previous reference:Cabinet 6(29), Con-elusion 2.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that as the result of enquiries at Geneva he had come to the conclusionthat, outside Italy, the settlement of the roman question was not giving much satisfaction to Roman Catholics.-5-
 QfflrttflS.S.  The Secretary of Dtotio for Foreign Affaiyotold the Cabinet an interesting anecdote thg*xhe had heard from Dr.  Streseman while at/Geneva.The German Foreign Minister had told/Sir Austenthat shortly after Lord Kaig1 s de th he had hadoccasion to visit Field Marshal von Hindenburg.The Field Marshal had met him with the remark&quot;So the victor in the Great War has passed away&quot;.On Dr. Stresemann1 s^asking what he meant, he had replied that he referred to Field Marshal LordHaig, and had/added that from the moment that lord Haig^had agreed to accept the unified command the is^ue of the War was certain.  The GermanPresident had added &quot;Great is the conqueror, but-6-
pjvIAlCGNTS. 6.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an account of the circumstancesReduction and limitation of.        in which an inaccurate version had appeared in an american newspaper of an interview he had had withpreviousReference: British journalists.     After Sir Austen had made aCabinet 57(28),  Con- statement to these journalists for publicationelusion 6.)he had agreed, in accordance with custom, to answer questions freely and confidentially.      Oneof the journalists had asked him whether theconclusion of the Kellogg Pact would not resultin speeding up Disarmament.      He had replied thathe did not think he could go so far as to saythat, and in the course of explaining his reasonsfor this had pointed out that the Americans them-selves had followed the conclusion of the KelloggPact by adopting a considerable Naval Programme.All this had been confidential and informal,  andit had been understood that no-one should telegraphthe information to his paper.      One newspaper man,however, had telephoned through to the Parisrepresenta tiVe . t;iat high authorities at Genevadid not expect immediate results in disarmamentto follow from the Kellogg Pact, but even he,when requested, had cancelled the communication.One, or perhaps two, members of the British Press,however, had spoken about this part of the interview,with the result that an American Correspondent had sent to his nev/s paper a tendencious and grosslyinaccurate account of what had taken place.      sir austen Chamberlain had then summoned the representa-tives of the two great American news agencies and issued a statement on the subject, which had been published.      The spokesman of the British corres-coorespondents had expressed their indignation at thisbreach of confidence.
7. The Cabinet had &quot;before them the following documents relative to the question of the proposedBaghdad-Haifa Railway and Pipeline:-(i) A Note by the Secretary (paper cp.-68 (29)) covering the Reportof Lord Stanhope&apos;s Inter-DepartmentalCommittee, dated June 13, 1928, inwhich the position of the questionis summarised to date, and which also contains appreciations of thepolitical, strategical, defence,and economic aspects of the question and recommendations as to the policy to be pursued with a view to securing-a Baghdad-Haifa alignment for theproposed railway and pipeline.(ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper C.P.-73 (29)).(iii) A Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs covering aMemorandum by the Foreign Office(Paper CP.-78 (29)).As explained in Paper CP.-73 (29), thenegotiations between the Turkish Petroleum company and the Iraq Government ultimately resulted, inDecember 1928, in an agreement being reachedunder which, in return for certain extensions oftime in regard to oil concessionss the Companyagreed inter alia to survey a pipe and rail route from Baghdad to Haifa and to submit a completeproject for the construction of a railway, unlessthe survey proved to the satisfaction of both parties that technical difficulties renderedimpracticable the adoption of that route.&apos;   Owingto objections raised by the French interests inthe Company the actual agreement only providedfor the survey of a Baghdad-Mediterranean pipeand rail route, and the provisions relating tothe Baghdad-Haifa route are contained in a letteraccompanying the Agreement. The French Governmenthave now formally protested and demanded that the
letter in question should be withdrawn and thatHis Majesty1 s Government should refrain from all further intervention and leave the matter to besettled on a commercial basis between the company and th3 Iraq Government.In the view of the Foreign Office (Paper C.P.-78 (29)) the advantages of maintaining the presentposition are insufficient to outweigh the disad-vantages of a serious dispute with France, and inthe view of that Department the best method ofsecuring a Baghdad-Haifa alignment to the railway and pipeline will be to authorise the british ambassador at Paris to endeavour, by personalnegotiation, to arrive at some formula satisfac-tory to the French Government.The Colonial Office have throughout opposedthis view and consider that if the French persistin their present attitude a dispute with them atsome stage is inevitable;    that the consequences,so far as the Middle East is concerned, can easily be over-estimated, and that the balance of advan-rtage lies in adhering to our attitude, seeing thatif the American interests in the Turkish PetroleumCormtany come over to the French point of view it may never be possible   to recover the presentposition.    Emphasis is also laid on the importance which the Iraq Government attach to the Baghdad-Haifa alignment and on the importance of avoiding any political action vis-a-vis the Iraq Governmentto induce them to abandon their demand for a survey of the1 Baghdad-Haifa route in return forthe time extensions desired by the Company.    TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs demurs to
these views and maintains that the policy recommended by the Secretary of State for theColonies is certain to involve us in serious trouble vrith the French and the Americans, and is unlikely to provide any compensatory advantage.In view of the fact that the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (Paper CP.-73 (29)) had reached the Cabinet only on thepreceding afternoon, with the result that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had only been able to circulate his Memorandum (Paper CP. -78 (29)) shortly before the Cabinet Meeting;, thediscussion was of a purely preliminary character.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To resume the discussion at their next weekly Meeting:(b) That the Secretary of State for     OUn^%Bej^a^B-A-i-f-8*3?* should be askedto circulate further information on the following points:-(i) Particulars of what the TurkishPetroleum Company has said orwritten to the Iraq Governmentin regard to the proposedBaghdad-Halfa railway andasto any reply made to theTurkish Petroleum Companyby the Iraq Government:    inparticular, this should includethe text of the Agreementbetween the Turkish petroleum company and the Iraq Governmentand of the &quot;draft&quot; letter(both referred to in paper c.P.-73 (29) Appendix 1) ,together with informationas to whether the &quot;draft&quot;letter in the form finally agreed to had been receivedby the Iraq Government or not:(ii) Whether there would be any breach of international obligation ifthe Iraq Government were toImpose the Haifa route as acondition for granting anextension of time for&quot;theirconcession to the TurkishPetroleum Company:
(1ii) Whether the Iraq Government could he induced to impose such a condi-tion without involving any breach of our position as a MandatoryPower:(iv) V/hether any pressure had been putby the British Government on theIraq Government to insist on Haifaas the t erminal&apos; port of the railway and pipeline:(v) A map of the whole region inquestion.
CHINA..piracy inBias Bay.(previous reference:Cabinet 18(27), Con-conclusion 2. )8. The Cabinet, had &quot;before them a Note by theSecretary (Paper CP.-74 (29)) circulating, bydireotion of the Prime Minister, a Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (O.I.D. Paper No.330-c) on Piracy in China Waters, &quot;together withan extract from the Minutes of the 240th Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence (Minute l)containing the following recommendations:-&quot; (a) That approval in principle shouldbe given to the recommendationssubmitted by the Chiefs of Staffin paragraph 38 of their Report(O.I.D. Paper No.330-C) ;    and(b) That the Admiralty should beauthorised to instruct the naval commander-in-Chief, China, thatthe Anti-Piracy Committee at hong-Kong should proceed on theassumption that the policy recom-mended by the Chiefs of Staff willbe adopted in principle, andshould submit in due coursedetailed proposals for giving effect to this policy&quot;.&quot;After a shtrt statement by the Prime minister the Cabinet approved the above proposals.
BRITISH 9. The Cabinet, had before them the Report ofRADIUMREQUIRE- the Radium Sub-Committee appointed in July, 1928,ME NTS.by the Committee of Civil Research to examinethe radium requirements of Great Britain inrelation to the present sources of supply (paper cp.-70 (29)).In view of the absence of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer the Cabinet did not discuss the merits of the Report but only the question of whether it should be published immediately.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of publication should be postponed until theGovernment had decided on theirpolicy, which could be announced at the same time:(b) That the question should beconsidered at the next weekly meeting of the Cabinet:(c) That the Minister of Health shouldbe asked to circulate a Memorandumof his views on the Report.
INDIA.proposed VisitDy the Viceroy.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(25) , Con-elusion 1. )10.  The Secretary of State for India informed the Cabinet that, with the approval of the PrimeMinister, he had sent an invitation to theViceroy of India to pay an official visit tothis country.The Cabinet approved this action.-14-
THE POLITICALSITUATION ININDIA.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(29), Con-elusion 1. )11.  The Secretary of State for India informed his colleagues that the Government of India wishedto hold the trials of certain Communists, whoincluded two natives of Great Britain, at Meerut,in the Oont par! Provinces, where the trial wouldtake place without a Jury.    Lord Peel had con-suited the Lord Chancellor on the point and had made enquiries on certain aspects of the matter on which Lord Hail sham had commented.    On one point raised by ^he Lord Chancellor he had ascertained that 7 out of the 18 or 19 accused,including one of the British citizens, had con-ducted their activities in the United Provinces.The two British citizens had a right to ask for white Assessors, but he thought they were unlikely to do so as they would expect lighter sentencesfrom Indian Judges.    The Government of India hadreassured him that the evidence was sufficiently strong to make a conviction likely.    Lord Peelthought, therefore, that all the Lord Chancellor5 apoints were met.
12.  The Secretary of State for Air reportedthat the South African Government had agreed to spend  80,000 a year for five years on co-operation in the establishment of an air routebetween this  country and South Africa.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairscommented that this provided satisfactoryevidence of the value of a British Representa-tive in the Dominions.    He thought the successof these negotiations had been due partly toconducting them through the British Representa-tive in South Africa.
UNEMPLOYMENT.Ins proposed committee.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(29), Con-elusion 4. )13. Enquiry was made as to whether theCabinet Committee on Unemployment had yet beenestablished.The Prime Minister pointed out that atpresent both the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Labour were absent.    he hoped to set up the Committee shortly after their return.
THE BUDGET.(previous reference:Cabinet 4(29), Con-clusion 1.)14. The Prime Minister was asked whether,on the occasion of the forthcoming Budget, a rather fuller opportunity than in recent yearscould be given to the Cabinet for its discussioiHe undertook to speak to the Chancellor of theExchequer on the subject on his return.
THE CHANNEL 15. The Prime Minister informed his colleaeuesTUNNEL.that he had encountered difficulties in arranging(Previous for the Leaders of the Opposition Parties to reference:Cabinet 4 oarticipate in an Inquiry in regard to the(29), Con-elusion 4.) Channel Tunnel at the present time.    For various reasons, including the near approach of theGeneral Flection, it was difficult for the Leadero:i  one of the Opposition Parties to take part.In the circumstances the Prime Minister thought the best plan would be to appoint an impartialnon-political Committee to examine the economic aspects of the project, with a view to the eventual publication of their Report.    Thedecision of the Government and the examinationof the project in its political and military aspects could be postponed until it was known whether it was a sound proposition from an economicpoint of view.In the course of a short discussion thesuggestion was made that the Terms of reference should be wide enough to admit the examination of alternative projects, such as the Channel Ferry.The Cabinet approved the Prime Minister&apos;sproposals and left to him, in consultation withany Ministers specially concerned, the composition and Terms of Reference to the Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.V..1,March 13, 1929.
