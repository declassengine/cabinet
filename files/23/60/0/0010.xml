NEW ANGLO- 1   The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memo-FRENCH SUBMARINETELEPHONE CABLE   randum by the Treasury and the Post Office (paper and CONNECTINGLAND LINES. CP.-61 (29)), circulated by direction of theChancellor of the Exchequer,  stating that, owing tothe growth of Anglo-French telephone traffic, a newsubmarine cable will shortly be required.    Underinthe arrangements which have been/operation forsome years the order for this cable will be givenby the French Post Office, who propose to place it with a German firm and to pay for it by means ofa Reparations credit.   It is improbable that any british firm could quote a price comparable to theGerman price.   The connecting land section of the cable between Canterbury and the coast must possessexactly the same electrical characteristics as thesubmarine section, and must therefore be manufact-used by the same contractor.   It is proposed thatthe expenditure to be borne by Great Britain( 40,000), representing half the cost of thesubmarine cable and the whole cost of the Englishland line, should likewise be met out of repara-tions.   The case is exceptional, since, for thereasons set out in the Memorandum, there wouldappear to be no alternative to obtaining the cablefrom Germany,  and if it is not paid for onreparation account the payment to the Germancontractor will have to be made in sterling,   inthe usual way.-   Thus the proposal to take theBritish share of the cable as a reparation deliverywill be of definite financial advantage, but willnot give any just ground for complaint to theBritish contractors.
After-disc-u-ssing the matter--with&apos;the Pastrcaste-General, the Cabinet invited Sir William MitchellThomson to try and get the placing of the ordersfor the cable postponed for three months.
THE UN EMPLOY-MBNT INSURANCEACT.The ThirtyContributionsRule.(previous reference e:Cabinet 49(28), Con-clusion 3 .)2.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (Paper C.P.-63 (29))explaining the reasons which rendered necessary adecision respecting the Unemployment insurance contribution qualification.   As indicated in theMemorandum, under the provisions of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Pot of 1927, a large number ofpersons (possibly as many as 110,000 but probablygraduallya less number) will^be disqualified from benefit in the twelve months from April 19, 1929, if the30-contributions rule is brought into operation asfrom that date.   These persons are largely concen-trated in a few areas mainly in Durham: and SouthWales .   The continued grant of benefit on laxcontribution conditions maintains in existence a class which is becoming demoralized by long idlenessat the public expense, and it is essential in theirown and the national interests that steps should betaken to bring a stricter rule into force and provid&apos;the needed incentive to transfer.To bring the 30 contributions rule into  force bya series of numerical steps is open to the objection that it would disqualify in the first year about36,000 persons of whom two-thirds would be men withdependants,  i.e., married men living in the distressed areas whose cases attract the greatestamount, of public sympathy and with which it is most difficult to deal under the transference scheme.To mitigate this difficulty, while at the same timemaintaining the principle of the 1927 Act,, it isproposed that as from April 19,  1929, the 30contributions condition shovtld be allowed to operate in the case of men and women without dependants,
but that in tbe case of men and women with dependantsthe transitional period and present conditions shouldbe continued for one year and that thereafter the rule should be gradually brought into operation overthe two following years.    This proposal involves the passage before the Easter adjournment of a short-but controversial Bill.The attention of the Cabinet was also drawn tothe fact that to render the transference schemesuccessful (a) great resolution is needed, and(b) schemes of new work are required in the areas to which it is proposed to move the men, and to thenecessity of examining afresh the position of able-bodied unemployed who for any reason are outsidethe scope of the Unemplo3rment Insurance Scheme, witha view to determining the steps to be taken to dealwith them.In conclusion, the Memorandum called, attentionto the financial position of the Unemployment Fund.If the live register remains as high as 1,500,000on the average, the borrowing powers, which were increased by the Act of last Session by  10,000,000to  40,000,000, will last until August next.   TheMinister of Labour recommended the Cabinet not to legislate on the subject now in spite of the risk,which he hoped would be slight, of a second Billlater in the year.In the course.of the discussion the Minister ofLabour emphasized the great importance of making a start with the Unemployment Insurance Act of 19 27,which in any event wotild have to be brought intooperation gradually.   He mentioned   a   possible alternative to the proposals in his Memorandum.
^uesirLcms&quot; were-a-ske-d -^s-H^wl*ed^en- ariimn -whohad refused work offered to him in some districtother than his own under the Transfer Schemeand who refused to accept work, or for sometrivial reason to -undergo training with a view tofitting him for employment, would be struck offthe register.   The Minister of Labour,  after- explaining how complicated such cases were apt tobe, said he would have to make inquiries fromthe Courts of Referees in mining areas as to theusual practice.After considerable discussion,  the cabinet agreed  That, owing to the continuance ofa high unemployment rate and thedistress caused thereby, theoperation of the UnemploymentAct, 1927, should be again post-poned for a year.
REPORT -of THEEAST AFRICANCOMMISSION.(previous reference e&apos;Cabinet 9(29), Con-clusion 3 .)3.In accordance with, the conclusion reached at the previous Meeting (Cabinet 9 (29), Conclusior3) the Cabinet resumed consideration of the course to be adopted with regard to the Report of theEast African Commission (Paper C.P.-3 (29)). jnaddition to the documents mentioned in the aboveConclusion, the Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies (Paper CP.-66 (29)) relative to thethree separate issues arising out of the Report.In regard to two of these issues, namely,   thequestion of the closer union of Kenya, Uganda and tanganyka in respect of certain common servicesand the general supervisory power of the futureHigh Commissioner or Governor-General over native policy in the three territories,  a settlement could probably be attained without serious difficultyeither in East Africa or at home.    The third issue,namely,  the increase of the non-official element-in the Kenya Legislature, was contentious from thepoint of view of India and Parliament.   While, inthe view of the Secretary of State, Sir HiltonYoung&apos;s recommendations would in practice adequate-ly safeguard the interests of the natives and ofthe Indian community, he was willing, in order tomeet Lord Peel&apos;s views,  to tell Sir Samuel Wilson,in his confidential instructions, to do his best to secure either the Commission majority scheme or such a variant of Sir Hilton Young&apos;s scheme as would not give the unofficial Europeans a clear majority on the Council,  and to make it clearthat any proposal which went further than this might run the risk of rejection at home.
The Memorandum, also drew atrtention to the delayswhich had occurred in dealing with this problem and to the importance of reaching a settlement inthe near future.In a Memorandum (Paper C.P.-66(A)(29)  theSecretary of State for the Colonies circulatedthe draft of a Question and Answer in parliament which he hoped to be able to agree with Mr &quot;liomasand which would form the basis of Sir SamuelWilson&apos;s published instructions.There was little criticism of Mr Amery&apos;proposal that Sir Samuel Wilson should be sentto East Africa to obtain information desired bythe Secretary of State, but, in view of theimportant issues involved,  reluctance was expressed at the proposal to announce theacceptance of the general principles set forth in the Commission1s Report.The Secretary of State for India urged, inaddition, that Sir Samuel Wilson should be given some definite instructions on certain controversialpo int s .After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed  That the Cabinet Committee whichhad advised the Cabinet on Policyin East Africa prior to the settingup of Sir Hilton Young&apos;s Commission,should be re-assembled as soon asthe views of the Government of india are received, to consider theinstructions to be given toSir Samuel Wilson, the permanent under-Secretary of State for theColonies on the occasion of his forthcoming visit to East Africa.(NOTE.     The Committee was composed as follows:-Mr Amery    (in the Chair),Lord Salisbury,Sir William Joynson-Hicks,nAfi\    ,   i   i Lord Peel,H * Or^A k JWt.l---Sir Samue I Ho are .J (See Cabinet 37 (27), Conclusion 5).)
UNEMPLOYMENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(29)&quot;   Con-clusion 4.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that he had undertaken to receive aDeputation from the Motor Industry on the following day.   He understood that the Deputation would demand, in the interests of unemployment, a heavy expenditure on roads, to be financed by a Loan.Mr Churchill proposed, in his reply,  to basehimself on the general attitude assumed in theTreasury Memorandum attached to 0 .P.-53 (29).He would show that State borrowing for purposeslike a road programme could only be drawn out ofthe general fund of available credit,  and conse-quently at the expense of private borrowers?that the employment to be obtained from road construction was limited, both in amount and intime, and compared unfavourably with permanentindustries that might be established by privateborrowing;    that if inflation were resorted tothe immediate result would be a movement of goldout of the country, involving the raising of theBank Rate and further restriction of credit.While adopting these general lines, Mc Churchillintended to leave the door open for such reasonable in mippr ways and as exc optional measures^,expenditure/, whether financed by Loan or otherwise,33 the G-overnment might decide it was wise tomake with a view to relief of unemployment.In the course of a short discussion the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade drew attention to theextent to which bank credit had been drawn onwithin recent years for^the establishment of new factories;    for example, in the motor and artificial silk industries;    and to the stimulusalready given to coal exports by the Rating ReliefScheme.
The Cabinet approved the general line which the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to take, on theunderstanding that he did not rule out such minor and exceptionalexpenditure as the Government might think it wise to make in anyparticular direction.-9-
UNEMPLOYMENT. 5. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum byMr Lloyd George&apos;s the Minister of Transport (Paper C.P.-S9 (29))Speech of March1st,  1929 . commenting on certain statements relative to road Expenditure made by Mr Lloyd George inhis speech on March 1, 1929 .-10-
ANGLO- 6. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theEGYPTIANFINANCIAL       Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-60 (29))NEGOTIA-TIONS. covering a Report by Mr F.W.Leith Ross, C.B., ofthe Treasury, on his recent negotiations with theEgyptian Government in regard to the settlementof the 1855 Loan and other outstanding financial questions .   As regards the Loan the egyptian government undertake, in consideration of aBritish payment to Egypt of a share of reparationsfixed at 0.464 of 1 per cent, of the total repara-tion receipts distributed to the British Empire,to make an immediate payment of  328,000 in respectof arrears and to pay the British Government afurther sum of  1,386,000, of which  302,310 isto be paid immediately and the remainder by sixteenannuities of approximately  90,000 per annum (withcertain rights of prepayment) to be met out&apos; of thefuture Egyptian share of reparations.   The BritishGovernment will assume full responsibility for theLoan in future.    The British Shipping and Armyclaims are to be met by a payment by Egypt of 849,000.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressedthe view that the arrangements made were of a very satisfactory nature, and proposed that Lord Lloydshould be authorised to sign the documents as soonas the Egyptian Government intimate their readiness to do so,    and that he should be asked to press for the completion of the agreement in March, 1929,if no intimation is received from the egyptian government on the subject before then.
The Cabinet took note of this report with satisfaction, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer toexpress their thanks to Mr Leith Rossfor his successful conduct of this difficult negotiation.
SCOTLAND .immigration from Ireland(previous reference:Cabinet 42(28),  Con-elusion 10.)7. The Cabinet further considered the questionof Immigration from Ireland into Great Britain, andhad before them a Memorandum by the Home Secretary(Paper CP.-45 (29)) setting out the results ofinquiries which, in pursuance of the cabinet decision mentioned in the margin, he had made bothindependently and in conjunction with the scottish office and other interested Departments.    In theview of the Home Secretary the evidence as a wholeindicated that the immigration of natives of theIrish Free State is not now such as to affectmaterially the position created by the presence inScotland of a large body of persons of Irish extraction-tion, and that accordingly there is no need atpresent to adopt the scheme suggested by the Inter-Departmental Conference (Paper CP .-262 (28)) for placing restrictions on immigration into GreatBritain.   At the same time the Home Secretary drew attention to the serious problems arising out of thenumbers of Irish settled in Scotland and suggested(a-) :   as a just and practical measure of allevia-tion the repatriation of Irishmen who within a fixed period of their arrival in Scotland become a charge on the rates,  and (b) that an appeal should be madeto Scottish employers to give preference to Scottishrather than Irish labour.The Cabinet also had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Scotland (Paper C.P.-46 (29)) drawing attention to the inflow in 1928 of2,000 migrants from the Free State into Scotland,to the large number of persons of Free State originwho in recent years have become chargeable in scottish parishes, and to the unsatisfactory figures
relating to Scottish convictions for crime, etc..in the case of persons of Irish birth or extractionas compared with those persons of Scottish origin,and intimating that without further discussion hecould not accept the Home Secretary&apos;s view.    In afurther Memorandum (Paper G.P.-65 (29)) Sir JohnGilmour drew attention to certain recent Ministryof Labour figures regarding the number of Irishmigrants employed on the Lochaber Water Schemeand to the possibility that, owing to the Senate ofthe United States deciding no longer to    postpone the operation of the national origins provisions ofthe Immigration Act of 1924,  the quota for IrishFree State immigrants into the United States willbe greatly reduced as from the 1st July next, andthat for immigrants from Great Britain and NorthernIreland greatly increased.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to the decision of the Cabinet on August 1,- 1928, that the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should press Mr Cosgrave on the questionof the repatriation of immigrants from southern ireland who had become a charge on the Poor Law.The suggestion was made that it might be possibleto deport such persons, but it was alleged thatthis was prohibited by the Articles of agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland,1921.With a view to further consideration of this aspect of the question, the Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to look into the position of the possible deportation of citizens of the Iridh Free State who have &quot;become a charge upon public funds.-14-
PETROL PRICES. 8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the(previous Cabinet that a number of Questions had been put&apos; Refer ence:Cabinet 3 down for Thursday next in the Rouse of Commons on(28), Con-conclusion 4 (c) the subject of the recent rise in petrol prices.(i).)These Questions turned on the suggestion that theGovernment,  as possessing a controlling interestin the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, ought not to have allowed this rise in price.    For the reasons givenin the draft statement in the Appendix there wasno difficulty in rebutting this suggestion.   Amore difficult question arose, however,  as to what action,  if any, was to be taken towards the oil companies.   Mr Churchill&apos; 3 view was that theGovernment were entitled to insist on the Companiesjustifying, the rise to the public,  as proposed inthe last part of the Appendix, which he read tothe Cabinet.    If the Companies should refuse to givethe information required it would be possible toappoint a Tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921.   It was unlikely, however,that it would be necessary to resort to thisextreme measure .    If the figures could be obtained the Board of Trade could appoint an independentaccountant, to examine them and report whether therise of price was justified.In the course of the discussion doubts were expressed as to whether the full figures could beobtained.    It was suggested also that a difficult situation would arise if it transpired that one ofthe Companies concerned wa/3 justified in raising the price whereas the Anglo-Persian, on which theGovernment are represented, was making excessiveprofits out of the rise, as pressure would then bebrought to bear on the Government to compel this one
Company to sell at&apos; a &quot;lowex--ipari.ee. &quot;The suggestion was also made that the statement in the Appendixshould consist of the first page only,  and thatno mention at the present stage should be made of employing an independent accountant, but rather that this should be kept back until it was seen whether the Companies were giving the full information.The exact nature of the statement was leftto the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinisters concerned.S, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 6,   1929.
a P P E I? D I X.SECRET.ERAgT STATEMENT OH PETROL PRICES.Yes, Sir, the Government are fully alive to the significance to industry and the private consumer of therecent increase in the retail price of petrol and they have carefully considered the position that arises.      I should,however, say at once that in the opinion of the government this question must he dealt with on general grounds and not by reference to the relations between the Government and theAnglo-Persian Oil Company.     As has been stated on many occasions,   the Government are under obligation not tointerfere in the commercial management of the Company,and in pursuance of this policy no instructions were sought by the Government Directors in connection with the recent increase of price nor were any instructions given.As regards the general question, the government consider that ordinarily the public is best served by an efficient industry operating freely.     But specialconsiderations arise where a single undertaking or anassociated group of undertakings dominates the supply andthe general distribution of an article of common use.     Hero,too, large and efficient businesses acting together may give the public best service.     But they have a duty tosupply on reasonable terms;    the public ha-ve a right tobe satisfied that those terms are reasonable.The Government consider that the marketing of petrol under present conditions falls within this category and that the Companies should be prepared to
explain the reasons for any considerable increase in retail price.      In these circumstances it is theintention of the Government to invite the oil companies concerned to submit a statement explaining the reasonsfor the recent increase, and upon receipt of that statement to obtain the opinion thereon of an independent accountant.I wish, however, to make it clear that C(a) the Governmentare not taking this action because they have any grounds for thinking that the recent increase is unjustified or because it is their desire to make any such suggestion],[(b) in taking this action the Government are in no wayprejudging the case].     But, as I have already indicated,it is considered that the public in these specialcircumstances have a right to an impartial verdict.
