THE king. 1.    The Lord chancellor el lor thought the cabinet would like to know that the Commission for the(previous reference: Royal Assent had been signed by the King with his cabinet 2(29), Con- own hand.   This was the first case,  since hiselusion 4.)recent illness, in which His Majesty had signeda document which could have been dealt with bythe Counsellors of State .
THE UNITEDSTATES of America.The Prohibi-tion Treaty.The Sinking ofthe &quot;Iroalone&quot;.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(26), Con-clusion 3.)2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew attention to the sinking of the Schooner&quot;TMALONE&quot;,   suspected of liquor smuggling, by a united States Coastguard Cutter off the Lougianacoast.    Re said that the Foreign Office had not received any information beyond what had alreadybeen published in the Press.    Sir Esme&apos;Howardhad seen an official of the State Department,who had promised to let him know the facts assoon as official information was received, andwho had evidently thought the incident, if it took place as reported, was most unfortunate.Sir Austen Chamberlain added that the ship was reported to be on the Canadian register.In the course of a short discussion theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointedout that  even though the ship was on the Canadianregister it was a British ship, and, from chepoint of view of the discussion shortly to takeplace as the result of the last Imperial Confer-ence, he hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom would not stand in the back-ground in the negotiations on the ground that itwas a Canadian vessel.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked that the Dominions Office would communicateany views they might have on this aspect of thequestion to the Foreign Office.    Until the factswere established in detail no action could betaken.    For example, questions might be raised asto the precise meaning of the Agreements we had concluded with America on the subject of theaction of Prohibition vessels.   It was conceivable
that it might be necessary to press for arbitrationeither -under the Canadian Treaty, or else for conciliation under the Bryan Treaty,The Cabinet agreed with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that until the facts were known it was impossible for him. to decide what action should be taken.-3-i!
GERMANY.ReparationDesire for colonies .(previous refer enc e:Cabinet 12(29) , Con-clusion 2 .)3.   The Cabinet had before them a letter addressed by Kerr von Fuhlmann to Sir WilliamTyrrell which had been circulated by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (paper cp.-94 (29)).   In this letter Herr von Kuhlmannhad suggested that the heavy load to be imposedupon Germany by the Young plan, now before theConference of Experts on Reparation, would be considerably eased if in future Germany coulddispose under her own control of areas giving a reasonable supply of raw materials, and moreparticularly by the opening up of reasonableprospects f or colonial development .   Whilestating that Germany would present no claim to theformer German South-West Africa so long as theSouth African Union hold the Mandate there,Herr von Kuhlmann said there was a strong and lasting desire that Togoland and the Cameroonsshould form part of German colonial territory and had suggested that an arrangement did not seem impossible in regard to the retention ofGerman East Africa by Great Britain provided the southern part of this territory and the Nyasacountry were returned into the German spherein a form to be agreed upon.    He had also suggested that the British and German governments should examine how far the stipulations of theAnglo-German pre-War Agreements concerningAngola may be adapted to present circumstances,and that the pre-War Agreements concerning thePortuguese Colonies lying to the south of german east Africa should be brought up to date.
In the course of a statement on the subject ofthis letter the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  said that while passing through Faris onhis way to Geneva he had learned that Herr vonKuhlmann had been to see Sir William Tyrrell, had spoken of Dr. Stresemann&apos;s difficulties, and had said that it wou,ld help in the settlement of reparations if he could show some concession inthe political sphere.    At that time he had under-stood the only proposal was on the lines of aBelgian suggestion that Eupen and Malmedy shouldbe surrendered to Germany on the condition thatGermany took over responsibility for the GermanMarks left in Belgium at the time of the evacuation.Sir Austen Chamberlain had sounded M. Briand onthis subject, admitting at the time that neitherthe Germans nor the Belgians had said anything tohim about it.   He had pointed out, however, thatEupen and Malmedy appeared to have no particular value strategically.   M. Briand, rather to hissurprise, had taken the proposal quietly, and had said that he would make enquiries about it inParis.    To Sir William Tyrrell Sir Austen Chamberlainhad pointed out that this proposal was rathercharacteristic of the Germans.   It was not theAllies, but the Germans, who had wanted to alter the Dawes settlement.   In fact, the Chancellorof the Exchequer had at first been rather distress-ed at the proposal.   Now, however,  that the germans had been granted re-consideration of the ReparationAgreement they wished to be paid for agreeing!Recently Sir Austen&apos;s Private Secretary had been to Paris on leave for a few days, during which
Sir William Tyrrell had hande^him Herr vonKuhlmann&apos; s letter to show to Sir Austen.   Atpresent he did not know exactly what the status ofthe letter was, and he must determine this before he could deal with it.   Undoubtedly, however,  the proposition was an impudent one.    At some stagehe thought it ought to be communicated to theDominions,  and more particularly to the SouthAfrican Government, to whom the proposals relatingto East Africa and Angola were likely to berepugnant.   The proposal to revise the pre-WarAgreements in regard to Portuguese territory was particularly objectionable.    The British government or that day had entered into them most reluctantly,since they provided for spheres of interest inwhich any loans or liens granted by the portuguese government should belong either to Germany or toGreat Britain, with the understanding that if everPortugal abandoned these territories they shouldbe divided, according to the respective zones,between the two countries.   This had given greatoffence in Portugal.    Tne British Government had then helped the Portuguese in their financial difficulties so as to avoid granting any liens, andas a result had been accused of bad faith b^ theGerman Government.   Sir Austen Chamberlain advised the Cabinet to instruct him not to touch such agreements again or consent to review them;   not todiscuss the surrender or handing back   of any british mandated territory; or to express anyviews as to what should be done with any mandated territory that might be surrendered by any nation,since in such an eventuality the question obviously
would have to be discussed at&quot; the time on its merits .    Sir Austen Chamberlain asked, however,that he might be left discretion to decide themethod of dealing with this  question after hehad discussed it with Sir William Tyrrell and haddiscovered the status of the letter and its author,Lt^T,      .k  u.   who appeared to be/ in-an--uno-f-d:ei^l^po^art-ien-/j yfc. 5^v  j a*feege-%s*er.    For example, he might prefer to replythrough the British Ambassador at Berlin.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet that he had already informed them thathe had travelled with Herr von Kuhlmann from paris .    On that occasion Herr von Kuhlmann had referred to the former German Colonies.   He had replied that he himself would not have prolongedthe War for five minutes for the sake of thecolonies., but that he was absolutely convincedthat no British Government could possibly discusshanding them back, and that not a single member ofthe Cabinet would be ready to consider suchsurrender.    The conversation had been purely private and he had not thought it worth while to record it .Sir Austen Chamberlain recalled that he had made our position clear as far back as the LocarnoConference, namely, that if a Mandate became avail-able Germany would have the same right to apply for it as any other country.   He mentioned, however,that the Mandates were allocated by the Powersrepresented at the Versailles Conference and not bythe League of NationsaThe President of the Board of Trade pointed outthat Herr von Kuhlmann Ts argument in regard to raw.materials  was nonsense, since all nations could
purchase their raw materials from the mandated territories and there was no advantage in thisrespect to the Mandatory State.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs expressed the hope that the Foreign secretary would dispose of Herr von Kuhlmann*s suggestionthat the Versailles Treaty,  so far as it dealswith colonies, had only provided temporaryarrangements which some day must make place for more permanent settlements.   These mandated territories were held by Great Britain and theDominions not as tenancies from the League ofTIations,  but permanently,  subject only to certain obligations to the League.With the general assent of the Cabinet theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatafter seeing Sir William Tyrrell he would dealwith this question on the lines of his statement to the Cabinet summarised above.
ARMAMENTS .Reduc tion and limitation of(PreviousRefereno e:Cabinet 11(29), Con-clusion 6 .)k&quot;     The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Reduction and limitation of Armaments and the policy to beadopted at the next meeting of the PreparatoryCommission to be held on April 15,  1929:-A Report by the Lord Privy Seal,as Chairman of the Cabinet Com-mittee on Policy (Paper C.P.- 91(29)):A draft telegram to Sir Esme Howard,circulated by direction of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs (Paper CP.-96 (29)).The recommendations contained in the lord privy Seal&apos;s Report (Paper CP.-91 (29)) includethe following:-That the proposal likely to be madeby the German Delegation for theestablishment of a Naval Sub-Committeeshould be opposed by the BritishDelegate on the ground that dis-cvission of naval problems would serve no useful purpose unlesspreceded by diplomatic prepara-tion .That in regard to military and airproblems the British representative should announce to the commission that we would do our utmost to conform to what might be the desire of all the other Governments repre-s^nted,  and that at the outset heshould make a declaration to theCommission to this effect, on thelines of a draft attached to theReport.That as regards land armaments itshould be made clear that ouraccommodating attitude is due toour peculiar situation   that wewould not claim to be a millitary power in the Continental sense .That as regards air forces we shouldbe ready to adjust our disarmamentpolicy to that of other Powers,since, though the air is of special importance to the British Empire,our home defence problem could beregarded broadly as the same asthat on the Continent.That as regards naval matters our situation operates in the opposite
sense and we c mid not give anyblind undertaking to accept thedecisions of others .That if agreement should now proveunattainable the British Delegateshould urge on the Commission the disastrous effects of delay and make the proposal that each government should put forwardits own programme of land, navaland air armaments for an agreedperiod, in the form which it-considered best, their programmesbeing accompanied by statementsshowing what each Government hasalready done towards the reductionof its own armaments.It would be understood that thisproposal was intended to lead toa Conference at which the parti-cipants might agree to bind them-selves not to exceed those pro-grammes for the agreed period,save in the case of emergency and with due notice to the other parties.The draft telegram to Sir Esme&apos; Howard,circulated by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, was prepared with the intention of communicating, for the confidential informationof the United States Government and as a prelim-inary step, the general line o^ the proposedinstructions to the British Delegate to theDisarmament Conference.In the course of the discussion a numberof amendments were introduced, both intothe statement appended to the Report of theinCabinet Committee on Rolicy, as well as /to thedraft telegram circulated by the foreign secretary.      The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster (in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Air on one point) undertook tore-draft the former, and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs the latter.
After considerable discussion,  theCabinet agreed -(a) To approve the general lines of theReport of the Cabinet Committee on policy (CP.  91  (29));(b) To approve the statement appended tothe Repo:-. t of the above Committee,subject to a number of amendments which nave been incorporated in the copy attached to these Conclusions(Appendix I).

PETROL:PRICES(pr ev iou sRe ference:Cabinet 12(29), Con-clusion 8 .)6.  The Cabinet had before them a Report of aCabinet Committee set up at their previous meeting (Paper CP.-92  (29)) covering a copy of astatement on Petrol and Kerosene Prices by thethree Oil Companies concerned (Cmd.3296 (1929))and a Memorandum prepared in the PetroleumDepartment of the Board of Trade on that Statement(Paper P.P.(39) 2).The Cabinet Committee suggested the terms of anannouncement to be made by the Prime Minister tothe effect that the Statement furnished by the oil Companies was correct:    that the Governmentare satisfied that the prices in this country arenot above the parity of world prices;    drawing attention, in connection with the suggestion thatthe Government should use their position to force the Anglo-Persian Gil Company to review petrol and kerosene prices in Great Britain, to ahitherto unpublished letter dated May 20, 1914,from the Treasury to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company,and promising to publish it;    announcing that nofurther action would be taken in the present case,but that the Government do not hold themselvesprecluded from taking such steps as they may thinkadvisable in the future if circumstances shouldwarrant their intervention.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Government&apos;s decisionon the question should be inthe form contained in CP.  92 (29),subject to the following amend-ments:-Second paragraph,  lines. 5 and 6:-Before the words &quot;The Governmentare satisfied&quot; put &quot;It appears&quot;.At the end of the second paragraph,insert the following:-&quot;In these circumstances theGovernment consider that no action is called for on their part at the present time&quot;.
Delete the last paragraph.(A copy of the statement as approvedby the Cabinet is attached inAppendix III).(b) That the statement should be made inthe House of Commons on the following day, Wednesday, March 27th, bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer.(NOTE.    By subsequent agreement betweenthe Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Prime Minister this statement was actually madeby the latter on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 26th.)
THE REPORT of the EASTAFRICANCOMMISSION.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(29)    Con-clusion 3.)7-   With reference to the discussion noted inthe margin of the action to be taken with regardto the Report of the East African Commission, theCabinet had before them an Interim Report of theCommittee on Policy in East Africa (Paper CP.-98 (29)).ivIn this Report  (see Appendix/hereto) theCommittee recommended that the instructions toSir Samuel Wilson,  the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State for the Colonies, on the occasion of his forthcoming visit to East Africa should be inthe following terms:-You are to proceed to East Africa inorder to discuss the recommendationsof the Hilton Young Commission forthe closer union of Kenya, Tanganyikaand Uganda,   (and such possible modifi-cations of these proposals for effect-ing the object in view as may appeardesirable) with the Governments con-concerned and also with any bodies or individuals representing the various interests and communities affected,with a view to seeing how far it maybe possible to find a basis of generalagreement.   You are to ascertain on what lines a scheme for closer union-would be administratively workableand otherwise acceptable,  and. toreport the outcome of your consulta-tions .The Committee also recommended that theGovernment&apos;s decision should be comPttnicated tothe House of Commons by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies before the Easter Recess bymeans of the Question and Answer set out inparagraph 3 of their report and suggested,in the event of Supplementary Questions being asked with regard to the &quot;Kenya franchise&quot; and&quot;self-government&quot; the Answers indicated inparagraphs 4 and 5 of the Report respectively.
Considerable discussion took place inregard to the proposed Answers to be given inthe event of supplementary questions, and inview of the fact that Sir Samuel Wilson wasbein^, sent out to ascertain on what lines ascheme of closer union would be administrativelyworkable and otherwise acceptable, a strongopinion was manifested in favour of avoiding giving any Answers  to supplementary questions at thepresent time.The Secretary of State for India made itclear that this course was much to be preferredfrom the Indian point of view.      The Secretaryof State for the Colonies insisted that itwas essential that the points at issue shouldbe made clear before the discussions in EastAfrica began,  otherwise there was no prospect of securing any agreement on any schemeof closer union.      He added that, while hewas willing to do his utmost to avoidsupplementary Answers in the House of Commonshe would be under great pressure to make hisposition clear on the lines of the supplementaryAnswers proposed in the Cabinet Committee&apos;sReport in the near future.      In any case hecould hardly avoid doing so in a speech whichhe would have to make on the subject on May8th.The Secretary of State for India reminded the Cabinet that,  on two occasions when he had&apos;
been present,  that is at the imperial conferences in 1918 and 1923, a Resolution hadbeen passed calling attention to the incongruityof the position enjoyed by Indians within theEmpire in view of the new status that india had acquired since the War.      (He was not himself present at the Conference in 1921, when a similar Resolution was adopted).     Lord Peelsaid further that the British Governmentcould not be said to have carried out fully the pledge implied in these Resolutions andthat,  so far as concerned Kenya, whatever theparticular difficulties there,  the result wasthat,  in the minds of Indians,  the Government didnot seem to have taken up a very heoric position.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the instructions toSir Samuel Wilson,  the permanent under-Secretary of State for theColonies,  on the occasion of his forthcoming visit to East Africa,on the lines proposed in Appendix IVto these Conclusions.(b) To approve the Answer to be given bythe Secretary of State for theColonies in the House of Commons,as proposed in Appendix IV.(c) That as regards the matters dealtwith in the proposed Answers to supplementary questions,  theSecretary of State for the colonies should &quot;stonewall&quot; as long as hecould.(d) That if the Secretary of State for theColonies had not made the points a tissue clear before Sir Samuel Wilsonlanded in East Africa,  the latter wasto do so on the lines of the suggestedanswers to supplementaries.-16a-

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byPOLICY.the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(Previous (Paper CP .-87  (29)) on the subject of government reference:Cabinet 11 Employment Policy.(29), Con-elusion 13). Owing to the time taken up in thediscussion of the questions recorded in thepreceding Conclusions,  it was impossibleto take up the question of Government Policy.The Prime Minister said that he was in communication with colleagues on the subject,and would raise the question immediatelyafter the Easter Recess.

OUTLINE OF THE DECLARATION TO EE MADEBY THE BRITISH REPRESENTATIVE .It is suggested -that the declaration to he made by the British Delegate might be on these lines:-After explaining why His Majesty&apos;s government think it impossible to carry the discussion onthe naval branch of the subject further at this moment, he might proceed on the following lines:-Many of the proposals before the PreparatoryCommission have already been discussed atGeneva,  and on a number of them there hasbeen-a divergence of views.    The british delegates in the past have been obliged toexpress doubt as to the wisdom or justice of some of the suggestions made and to call attention to the difficulties that might be encountered in putting them into effect.They have on their side made positive pro-posals which have likewise failed to obtainunanimous acceptance.    On the whole, Hisivajesty&apos;s Government have not seen reasonto change the viera which have hitherto been expressed on their behalf.If, however, a conclusion is to bereached,  it is clear that where differentopinions are held mutual adjustments and concessions must be made.The situation of all Governments hererepresented is not identical in respect ofeach of the three arms .    I will leave aside for the moment the question of air armaments
for in that sphere the Commission has provi-provisionally in fact reached a large measure ofagreement.   But on behalf of my government have a word to say on the question of landarmaments.    Great Britain is not a millitary power in the Continental sense of the term.Her military system itself is fundamentallydifferent from that of most countries repre-sented in the Commission,  and her land  forces have suffered reduction to such a point thatthey cannot claim to rival those of ContinentalPowers.   We recognise that in this sphere the lead must be taken by the great military Powersand that the possibility of effective limitar-tion depends on the reconciliation of theirviews and policy.   We do nbt therefore desireto take a leading part in questions relatingto land forces.    The all-important considera-tion to us is the attainment of 3uch an agree-ment as will make progress possible, and thoughour own system is so different from those of continental Powers, we feel confident that weshall be able to accept any proposals whichmeet with the unanimous assent of the other powers present.   In these circumstances we donot propose now to repeat the arguments which lord Cecil and I myself have used on earlieroccasions in regard to the different points on which differences have arisen.    By theadoption of this attitude, ,His Majesty&apos;sGovernment hope to facilitate agreement inthe Commission, and whilst reserving their right to examine the results of the Commission&apos;
labours as a whole, I repeat that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will endeavour to accept, and feelconfident that they will be able to accept,  any scheme which meets with the approval of therest of the Commission.The above applies to land armaments.   Asregards air armaments,  air power is, of course,of very special importance to an Empire asscattered as ours and embracing such widestretches of relatively undeveloped territory.My country&apos;s problem of home defence is, however,broadly speaking,  the same as that on theContinent, though its forces are at presentconsiderably smaller than those of otherContinental countries, and my Government would therefore expect,  as in the ease of land armaments,to be able to agree to any further principles inconnection with the limitation of air armamentsthat may secure the unanimous approval of othercountries .The members of the Commission will realise that what I have said about the special positionof  my  country in the military sphere appliesdifferently from the naval sphere.   Here at theproper time we must of necessity claim to havea larger voice in what is a matter of vitalinterest to us.   We are anxious, and indeeddetermined, to ^ind a solution of the navalproblem,  and we hope to take an active part inits realisation if time be given to us to overcomedifficulties which ha^e hitherto prevented agree-ment.
I should be glad if Your Excellency mould make a verbalcommunication in the following sense either to Secretary ofState or Mr. Castle.His Majesty1s Government have lately reviewed theInstructions to their Delegate on the Preparatory Committeefor the Disarmament Conference, which meets at Geneva onApril 15.It seems to be generally felt that it will be impossible at this stage to make progress with naval disarmamentproblem and indeed it is not likely that discussion in fullCommittee or even in a special naval Sub-Committee at Genevawould be fruitful of result until the ground has been pre-pared by previous consultation through diplomatic channels,particularly between the United States and ourselves.His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to take the line that difficulty of proceeding with naval problem is no reasonfor doing nothing in regard to disarmament on land and inthe air.      Principal naval Powers, bound by washington treaty, have already accepted very large measure of limitation, and even of reduction:    no agreement has beenreached in regard to armies or air forces.      It is most desirable that progress should be made in those spheresand His Majesty&apos;s Government have given instructions whichwill enable their Delegate to co-operate in the most helpfulmanner possible.His Majesty&apos;s Government fear, however, that it isnecessary to contemplate the possibility that, along thepresent lines of discussion, no agreement may be reached,  andthey have been considering whether, in the event of a break-down, any more promising alternative course could be proposed the Convention which the Committee have for two years been trying to elaborate is not very ambitious.      It wouldin practice amount only to an agreement by the signatoriesnot to exceed certain limits which would be fixed by eachfor themselves.      In fact each signatory would be bindingitself not to exceed a certain maximum programme for a givenperiod.      But the Committee have been unable to agree on the headings or framework of the programmes.     And while discussionlargely theoretical continues, no real progress is being made towards the actual limitation of armaments.      If, therefore,it becomes clear that the Committee can make no real progress on present lines, His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplatesuggesting that, since agreement cannot be reached on the exact form in which programmes are to be presented, ratherthan do nothing, each Government should be asked to submit a programme, In its own form, covering a period of years, inthe hope that the programmes might eventually be assembledand embodied in a convention binding the signatories not to exceed them.As the United States Government are aware, the Frenchand other continental Governments attach great Importance totheir theory that all three arms must be treated alike, and .therefore we might be asked whether we should be willing toapply the proposal for programmes such as outlined above tothe navy as well as to the army and air force.     For their part His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to do so and
are disposed to believe that such a procedure when applied to naval armaments might after friendly discussion between our two Governments assist to a solution of the difficultieshitherto separating the United States and ourselves and mightrender possible the realisation of some, if not all, of theresults which the naval Powers have been seeking to obtain.But before issuing final Instructions to the british representative His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to assurethemselves that the Government of the United States agreethat until there has been an opportunity for further con-fidential discussion between the two Governments as fore-shadowed in Mr. Kellogg&apos;s note of Itwould be unwise to resume the discussion of the naval issueson the old lines and that it is consequently desirable thatthe naval debate should be adjourned.      If the United StatesGovernment agree on this point as we anticipate they will,we should further be glad to know whether they see any objection to the British representative giving an affirmativeanswer in regard to the presentation of naval programmes if in consequence of a failure to agree on military categorieshe Is obliged to suggest procedure by programmes to avoid a complete breakdown.For the moment His Majesty&apos;s Government wish enly toobtain the confidential view of the United States Government,as a preliminary step.     His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxiousto avoid giving any impression that they despair of the successof the Preparatory Committee on present lines and to avoid prejudicing in any way its chances and for that reason they trust that the United States Government will regard this communication as entirely confidential.     The proposaloutlined above would only be made if discussion on presentlines definitely fails.      In that event British Delegate would explain proposals to members before the;f disperse and begthem to obtain the views of their Governments thereon at theearliest opportunity.
SUPPLEMENT    TO    APPENDIX    II.Political Distribution.Cypher telegram to Sir E. Howard (Washington).Foreign Office, 26th March,  1929,  11.45 p.m.No. 171.Very Confidential.My immediately preceding telegram.Following supplementary explanation may assist you in your discussion with the State Department.We contemplate that the forthcoming meeting of thecommission may fall Into tv/o phases:-(1) an endeavour to reach agreement on land and(so far as it remains still to be done) on air on lines which committee have so far pursued.(2)  if agreement on these lines should prove impossible, propose procedure by programme as solutionof land and air problems.If we do make this proposal we shall very likelybe asked whether we would apply the same solution tothe navy.     We should like to reply in the affirmative,but we should hesitate to do so unless we know that theUnited States share our hope that this offers a prospectof a solution of the naval difficulty.     That is why weare consulting them.      There is of course no question of ,submitting programmes during the present section of thecommission.We realise that time Is very short but It has only nowbeen possible to arrive at the decision after matureconsideration of this complex problem and we are taking thefirst opportunity to consult the United States government.
As the text of my Immediately preceding telegramhas been carefully considered in the Cabinet, you should adhere  closely to its terms in your communication to the State Department.The Prime Ministers of the Dominions are beinginformed very confidentially of the instructionscontained in my telegram under reference.
hi ij OPETROL PRICES.Announcement approved by the Cabinet on 26th March. 1929,-   -TGabinet 13 (29)).---The Government have examined the statement furnished by the Oil Companies, and are satisfied that the &quot;U.S. Gulf&quot;prices quoted for petrol and kerosene, on which the Companies&apos;statement is based, are correct.     The other items of costhave also been examined, and no reason has been found fordisputing them.Such comparisons as are possible have been made betxveenretail prices in this country and abroad.      In view of thesecomparisons and of the figures contained in the Companies&apos;statements, it appears that the prices now being charged to consumers in this country are not above the parity of world prices, and that the recent Increases do not involve anydiscrimination against this country.      In these circumstances,the Government consider that no action is called for on their part at the present time.It has been suggested that the Government should use their position in relation to the Anglo-Persian Oil company to force that Company to reduce petrol and kerosene prices InGreat Britain.      It is necessary, therefore, again to refer to the terms of the arrangement between the Government and theCompany as set out in Command Paper 7419 of 1914, paragraph 4of which states in general terms the nature of the assurancethen given that the Governments right of veto will be exercisedonly in respect of matters of general policy.The paragraph in question has reference to a letter dated the 20th May, 1914, from the Treasury to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which has not hitherto been published.I think it is now advisable that the exact terms of this communication should be made public, and I will circulate acopy of the letter with the official report.

At their Meeting on March 6th 1929 (Cabinet 10(29)Conclusion 5), the Cabinet had. under consi&amp;erafcico a, report of theEast African Commission (Paper CP. 3(29)) and MeraOran&amp;a by theSecretary of State for the colonies and. the Secretary of Statefor India, and agreed that the Committee on Policy in East africa should be reassembled as soon as the views of the Government ofIndia had been received, to consider the instructions to be givento Sir Samuel Wilson, the Permanent Under Secretary of State forthe Colonies, on the occasion of his forthcoming visit to EastAfrica.2.The Committee recommend that the instructions to Sir SamuelWilson should, be in the following termsYou are to proceed to East, Africa in order to discussthe recommendations of the&quot; Hilton Young Commission forthe closer union of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda,  (andsuch possible modifications of these proposals for effecting the object in view as may appear desirable)with the Governments concerned and also with any bodies or individuals representing the various interests andcommunities affected, with a view to seeing how far it may be possible to find a basis of general agreement.You are to ascertain on what lines a scheme for close reunion would be administratively workable and otherwiseacceptable, and to report the outcome of yourc onsultat ions.3. The Committee also recommend that the Government&apos;s decision should be communicated to the House of Commons by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies before the Easter Recess by means of thefollowing Question and Answer.
stion- -0 ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies what action is contemplated by the Government with regard to therecommendations of the Report of the recent Commission onCloser Union in East Africa (Cmd. 3234), and what machinery is proposed for giving effect to his undertaking that local opinion in East Africa will be consulted before any finalcommitments are entered into.wer. I propose to ask Sir Samuel Y/ilson, the permanent under Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, to proceedto East Africa as soon as possible in order to discuss therecommendations of the Hilton Young Commission for the closer union of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, and suchpossible modifications of these proposals for effecting the object in view as may appear desirable, with theGovernments concerned and also with any bodies or individuals representing the various interests and communitiesaffected,  with a view to seeing how far it may be possibleto find a basis of general agreement.      It will be his taskto ascertain on what lines a scheme for closer union wouldbe administratively workable and otherwise acceptable, andto report the outcome of his consultations.     His reportobviously will not be available until after the GeneralElection, but any proposals for action arising out of itwill,  in so far as the present Government are concerned, besubmitted to Parliament before any final decision Is taken.
4, In the event of a Supplementary Question being asked.with regard to the Kenya franchise, the Committee suggest thatthe Answer should be as  ollows -&quot;Whatever may be the ultimate ideal as tothe basis of the franchise in the future,the natter is one which can obviously.only be settled by agreement, as suggestedby the Commission.    Unless and until thereis such general agreement His  fajestyTsGovernment would not be justified in depart-ing from the policy laid dov/n in 1923&quot;.5.    If in a further Supplementary Question the Government are asked whether they accept the view of the majority of theCommission that there can be no question of responsible government in these territories until the natives can share inthe responsibility.     The Committee recommend that the answer should be -&quot;The policy of the Government in this matter is set out in the two White Papers(Cmd. 1982 aM Cmd. 2904). responsible government is not in question within any period of time which need now be taken intoconsideration.   We are prepared, however, asa part of a scheme of closer union, tn oon-sider a carefully guarded advance in theassociation of an unofficial element in the responsibilities of trusteeship.    Any futureprogress towards self-government must be leftto take the lines which the passage of timeand the growth of experience may indicate.&quot;Signed on behalf of the CommitteeL.S.
