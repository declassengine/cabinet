i.The Cabinet had before their a draft telegram to the British Ambassador at Washington, preparedby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and circulated by direction of the Pris.e Minister (paper c.P.-133 (29)).    In this draft confidence was expressed that a settlement could be found of thedifficulty which had divided Great Britain and theUnited States of America on the subject of naval armaments;    anxiety was felt as to the possible consequences of publicly presenting the new american proposals in any detail before a private and confidential exchange of views (such as was impos-sible before the General Election) had taken place between the two countries:    and the suggestion wasmade that the proposals should be discussedconfidentially as early as possible after theElections, in the first instance perhaps through diplomatic channels .As the result of a discussion the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs undertook to re-draft the telegram on lines suggested by the LordChancellor, with a view to avoiding any possibilityof interpretation that His Majesty&apos;s Government were seeking delay and taking advantage of the GeneralElection for this purpose.A copy of the telegram in the form in which itwas actually sent is attached as an Appendix tothese Conclusions.

(^EMPLOYMENT. 2. In view of the allegations that have recently-appeared in certain sections of the Press that the(previous reference: Inter-Departmental Committee on   nemployment which cabinet 17(29^, Con- considered Mr Lloyd George&apos;s pamphlet &quot;We canelusion 7.)conquer unemployment&quot; had reported in favour ofthe for. er Prime Minister&apos; s proposals (Paper C.P.-104 (29)),  the Cabinet further considered thequestion of the publication of a White Paper onthe sub j ec t.Notwithstanding that in a few cases theDepartmental Reports gave some support to certain of Mr Lloyd George*s proposals, the Cabinet feltthat the best plan would be to publish,  for theinformation of Parliament as a   hite Paper, thewhole of that part of the Report which deals withMr Lloyd George&apos;s pamphlet,  subject to the following conditions:-(a) The omission of Sir barren Fisher&apos;scovering Memorandum, as well as the names of all the Civil Servantscone concerned:(b) An examination of the Report by theChancellor of the Exchequer,  theSecretary of State for &quot;ar and theMinister of Labour.
safeguarding of industries the woollen and textile industry.(previous reference:Cabinet  58(28)    Con-elusion 17 .)Z. The President of the Board of Trade reportedto the Cabinet that the Report of the Committeeappointed under the Safeguarding of industries procedure to enquire into the -Voollen and &quot;worstedTrades had reached him on the previous evening and would be circulated at once to his colleagues.The Report favoured certain Safeguarding Duties .The question would arise alrost at once as towhether the Report was to be published.After some discussion the Cabinet reservedtheir decision upon the question of whether theReport should be published at once until theywere acquainted with its contents.
GERMANY. 4. In pursuance of the discussion noted in the reparations       margin, the Cabinet had before them a MemorandumInter-Allied     by the Treasury (Paper CP.-127 (29)), circulatedDebts .  by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,The FrenchDebt to relative to the question of the French Debt to america forWar Stocks .       Air-erica for  &quot;ar Stocks .    The Memorandum explainedthat,  failing ratification by August 1st next of(previous reference:       the Franco-American Fundine Agreement, France willCabinet 18(29), Con-      te obliged to make an immediate payment of elusion 1.) 80,000,000 to America, representing the War Stockportion of her American Debt,    If this payment weremade it would be most desirable that the BritishGovernment should claim a proportionate payment from france of  60,000,000 on the pari passu principle which has throughout been regarded as fundamental.Among other cogent reasons for this attitude isthe necessity for protecting the sterling-dollarexchange, which would be subjected to a very embarrassing strain if the French Government devotedtheir large sterlin- balances to liquidating their war Stocks debt.    In the view of the Treasury themost effective procedure to adopt in the event ofthe French Government refusing to admit the Britishclaim and selling their sterling balances would beto renew the French Treasury Bills falling due on june 1st and July 1st next to August 1st next insteadof for one year, as is customary.   At the same time it is proposed th&apos;.t the reply to a letter from theFrench Finance Minister relative to the French Debtpayment for 1929 should contain a stipulation inthe following terms:- \
&quot;His :/a2 331,y&apos; s Gov ernrf&apos; ent would be willing to accept this continuation of the provisional arrangement hithertoin ^orce, provided that the payments byPrance to the United States Governmentcontinue similarly on the scale providedfor in the Berenger Agreement.   But, ifthe French Government make any capitalpayments to the Government of the UnitedStates in respect of any of the obliga-tions covered by that Agreement,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be bound to claim a proportionate capital payment in respect o^ the obligations due tothis country&quot;.This reservation is most necessary, and will furnish the French Government with a strong additionalinducement to press upon their Parliament the ratification of the &apos;.&apos;ar Debt Agreements with boththis country and America, and thereby prevent boththe payment of . 80,000,000 to America in Augustnext and the adverse effects that such a paymentmight have upon our exchange.The Cabinet authorised the Chancellorof the Exchequer to proceed on thelines set forth in Paper CP.-127 (29)and summarised above.
GERMANY. 5. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMilitary Secretary (Paper C.P.-405 (28)) circulating bySituationin. direction of the Prime Minister the following documents dealing with the Military Situation in(previous reference: Germany:-Cabinet 11(29), Con- An Extract from the Minutes of the elusion 1.) 2S9th Meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence (Minute 1):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (C.I.D. Paper No.925-B) covering a Memorandum bythe Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff.The conclusion reached in the last-nameddocument was that, owing to lack of the necessaryarmaments and equipment, Germany is not, inpresent circumstances, in a position to wage aneggressive war or possibly even to defend herselfagainst a first-class Power;    she is, however,making preparations so 3s to take advantage of any revision in her favour of the military provisionsof the Versailles Treaty, and if the League ofNations fails to secure a general measure of disarmament she will claim to be absolved from thedisarmament clause of the Treaty, and in that eventwould soon again become a first-class military Power,The Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum(Paper CP.-121 (29)) by the Foreign Office dealingparticularly with the political aspects of thequestion, in which the view was expressed that,during the period while the republic was beingconsolidated, no German Government was likely toencourage tendencies of a pronounced militaristicnature.   There was no serious&apos; danger of the positionbeing altered by a coup d! * tat restoring the monarchy, tut when firmly established the German  .Republic may be expected to follow restless and
ambitious policies.    The hey to the situationprobably lay in the degree of progress towardsgeneral disarmament to be attained in the nearfuture.The Cabinet took note of theab ov e Ker or anda,
6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War (Paper C.P.-119 (29)) deprecating the grant to members ofthe Air Force who took part in the operations against the Akhwan tribes in 1927-28 of theGeneral Service Medal on the ground that theoperations in question, like other similar expedi-tions in Penjwin, the Sudan and China, partookof the nature of police work rather than of&quot;arduous campaigns and well-fought and well-sustained battles and sieges&quot; (Royal Warrant,Article 653) . The Cabinet also had before them aMemorandum, by the  Secretary of State for Air(Paper CUP.-124 (29))  strongly dissenting fromthe views of the Secretary of State for War,urging the arduous, prolonged and successfulnature of the Akliwan operations and the unfairnessof taking the magnitude of the casualties inflictedor received as a test for rewards, and pointing out that the attitude of the War Office in thepresent case was inconsistent with the grant ofthe General Service Medal to troops engaged inNigerian expeditions in 1906, in which the numberof casualties had been very small..After the Secretaries of State for War andAir had set forth their respective points of view and a general discussion had taken place, theCabinet agreed  That the       stion should bereferred for settlement by thefollowing Cabinet CommitteeThe Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.
CHEMICALWARP-AREPOLICY.(previous reference:Cabinet 18(29), Con-clusion 3.)7.

CONSTITUTEDID SYNTHETICBAM.eviouseference:atinet 42(28), Con-conclusion 5.)8. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesdrew the attention of the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency, to the Reconstituted and Synthetic CreamBill which is now under consideration by theHouse of Loixis .In the course of the discussion it transpired that the Bill had teen introduced in the House ofCommons by a Private Member tut had been &quot;starred&quot;by the Chief Whip and had passed the uouse ofCommons., where there was strong feeling in itsfavour among all Parties, practically without opposition.   Nevertheless a good deal of^opposition had been manifested to the Bill from variousagricultural interests outside Parliament, such asthe National Farmers&apos;  Union and the Council of theCentral Landowners&apos; Association.    Consequently ithad been thought advisable not to introduce theBill in the Rouse of Lords as a Government measure;the original intention that it should be introduced by the Paymasters-General had been dropped,  and itwas to be sponsored by a Private Member, the earl of Cranbrook.    Colonel Guinness urged that, froma political point of view, having regard to thesupport for it in the House of Commons, the Billshould not be withdrawn or rejected without government representatives doing what they could to give it a fair hearing.The Lord Privy Seal explained that the Govern-&apos; government&apos;s policy,  as he had understood it, had been to support the present Bill, on the ground thatit was only In its present form that it couldmeet with acceptance:    and that when it became clear that the agricultural interests were opposed
to the Bill he had thought it should be withdrawn,lord Salisbury said he was in communication onthe subject with representatives of the agricultural interests in the House of Lords .The matter was left to the Lord Privy Seal todeal with in the light of the Cabinet discussion.

frS BLIND.previous reference:Cabinet 45(24), Con-clusion y, .11.    The Minister of Health informed theCabinet that he had been approached by CaptainIan Eraser, the blind Member for St. PancrasNorth, with a view to further legislation toassist blind persons.      Mr. Neville Chamberlainhad explained the difficulties of any largemeasures in view of the financial situation.Eventually, Captain fraser had made a strongr      case for a lowering of the present age limit(RO years) at which pensions are granted tothe blind.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer,while not opposing in principle a measure ofthis kind,  if a strong case could be made for it,,  insisted on the importance of itsthorough examination from the financial pointof view,  and pointed out that no money was available from existing taxation.

The attention of the Cabinet was drawn toan announcement in the Election Programme of oneof the political Parties of a policy ofproviding Unemployment Insurance for agricultural workers.The Cabinet agreed -That the question should beconsidered in the first instance by the Minister of Labour, inconsultation with the Ministerof Agriculture and Pisheries.2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S.V.1..-1st May,  1929.
APPENDIX.TO UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.Cypher telegram to Sir E. Howard.   (Washington).Foreign Office.      May 1st,  1929.    4.15 p.m.No.227.His Majesty&apos;s Government have, as you are aware,warmly welcomed the public declaration by Mr.Gibsonat Geneva in regard to naval armaments.     They have beenequally favourably impressed by such indications as mr. Gibson has given privately and unofficially of thePresident &apos;s purpose and mind.      Basing themselves on thosedeclarations both public and confidential His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are confident that as between our twocountries a settlement could be found of the difficulty which has hitherto divided us;    that is to say that theUnited States and Great Britain could find a standardof parity which allowed sufficient latitude to meet thespecial needs of each.It is obviously more difficult to lay down rules which shall bo equally applicable for all navies butthey would not degpair of reaching agreement with theother great naval powers if once the broad lines ofagreement had been fixed for the naval forces of GreatBritain and the United States.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not know how far it isthe Intention of the United States government to carry the disctission at the present session of the preparatory committee but they would view with great anxiety thepossible consequences of publicly presenting the new proposals In any detail before there has been time and(i)
opportunity for a private and confidential exchangeof views.      His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad toknow from the United States government whether theywould desire that His Majesty !s Government should workout independently the weight to be given to the various factors on the basis suggested by Mr.. Gibson or whether,as His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to think, thespeedier and more practical plan the United Statesgovernment would be willing to furnish confidentially toHis Majesty&apos;s Government their own calculations for theconsideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.      In eitherevent His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly hope that theUnited States government will agree with His Majesty fsGovernment in thinking it desirable that there shouldbe no publication of any figures until there has been a confidential discussion between the two governments;   inthat case His Majesty &apos;s Government would suggest thatsuch a discussion might usefully be undertaken Immediatelyafter the general election at end of this month andthat it should take place in the first instance through diplomatic channels.Please make a communication to the above effectwithout delay to Mr. Stimson.Repeated to Geneva No ..55 for Information only.
