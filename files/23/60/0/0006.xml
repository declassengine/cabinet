At the request of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,  the Cabinet took note of histelegrar No. 103 to Sir S. Howard (Washington)of February 7, 1929, prepared after consultationwith the Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence on Belligerent Rights at Sea, in which the ambassador was instructed that wis Majesty&apos;sGovernment earnestly deprecate the issue ofinvitations to a Conference on Belligerent rights at an early date, and, above all, without theirhaving been given an opportunity of discussinga solution of all questions at present outstandingwith the United States of America confidentiallywith the United States Government before any decision is taken:    together with the reply fromSir E. Howard (telegram No.88 of February 9)  statingthat as soon as Mr Hoover returns to Washington hewould endeavour to speak to him on the lines of theabove telegram and, if this is not possible,  to convey a similar message to him through the state department.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet thathe hoped to be in a position to circulate theFirst Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on Belligerent Rights at Seadealing with the Renewal of Arbitration Treatiesto the Cabinet the same evening, for consideration at a Meeting of the Cabinet on Friday next, at

Sir AustenChapter lain did not think that there was anyquestion of the Vatican joining the League ofNations .   He had no reason to believe that the Popewould desire to accredit an Envoy to this country.Fe was not sure whether there was not some Statuteprohibiting anything of the kind.   Fe had given instructions to ascertain this definitely, and,ifhe found that there was some such prohibition,in the event of his seeing any sign of a desire of the Vatican to accredit an Envoy he would atonce indicate the statutory impediment.   If anythingtranspired on this subject Sir Austen said thathe would inform the Cabinet .
THE INDIANCONTRIBUTION&apos; TO THE HOMEEFFECTIVECHARGES OFTHE british army.(previous reference f er enc e:Cabinet 52(28)    Con-elusion 7 .)FX.3.   The Cabinet bad under further consideration the question of the Indian Contribution to theHore Effective Charges o^ the British Army,  andhad before them a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState *or India fPaper C.P.-1 (29)) covering the telegram which, at the request of the Cabinet attheir Meeting on November 21, 1928 (Cabinet 51(28), Conclusion 2), he had despatched to theViceroy, and a telegrar from. Lord Irwin datedDecerber 18, 1928, in reply.      In the lattertelegram the Viceroy, after summarising the pointof view of the Government of India and recapitulat-ing at length the political and financial objectionsentertained by that Government to the proposal toincrease the capitation rate,  concluded by stating the considered conclusion of the Government ofIndia to be that the whole basis of capitationpayments ought to be revised by an independent tribunal as a sequel to, or in connection with,the Statutory Commission^ Report.    If, however,the Cabinet, after due consideration of the argu-ments, considered that an independent,  tribunal should be set up immediately to consider theparticular question,  the Government of India wouldbe prepared to fall in with this course, providedthat the tribunal &apos;;ras definitely associated withthe Co-:--mis si on&apos;s inquiries and that the arrange-ments --ere made after consultation with Sir john simon.    Certain   points in thc telegram wereelucidated in lator telegraphic corregpondencecirculated to the Cabinet by the Secretary ofState for India under cover of a further Memorandum(Paper C .P.-S5( 39)) .
The Cabinet also had before their- a ? errorandLiir-by the Secretary 0* State &apos;or War (Paper C.F.-31(29))  in which the  Cabinet were urged to maintainthe view held by the majority on th0 occasion whenthe question was last before them, that india should pay an increased contribution towards thecost of the British troops in India,  and offeringthe following compromise in order to meet, as faras possible, Indisn views:-&quot;(i) To accept an addition of  200,000a year and the War Of&quot;ice shareof  65,000 on account of arrearsfrom April 1,  1926,   for each ofthe three years ending April 1,1930,  1931 and 1932 .(ii) After tho Simon Commission has reported, but not as part of its proceedings, to refer the ques-tion   whether any, and, if so,what, cont-distribution for 1933 and subsequent years shall be paidby India, to an independent tribunal to be set up by the twoGovemment s .(iii) That the contribution towards thecost of sea transport should cease.&quot;The Secretary of State for War, while unwillingthat the Tribunal  should be the Simon Commission,for reasons already given,  expressed his readinessthat the two Governments should be guided by theSimon Report in finally settling the personne 1.o^ fhe Committee.    Fe also suggested that, in substitution for,  or in addition to,  the terms ofreference suggested by the Viceroy, the inquiry should include the question of the cost, to GreatBritain 0* the long-service Army nec essitated bythe garrison in India,  and the replacement costof other troops raised by India if British troops were not available.
In the course of a statement on the position the Secretary 0e state ^or India said that theSecretary of State&apos;s Council had consented to animmediate Inquiry such as the Government of india were willing to accept.   Lord Feel insisted, howevthat the Government of India fs acquiescence was conditional on the Inquiry being extended to covertheir own counter-claims as well as the claims ofthe War Office.   He thought that the Government ofIndia and the Secretary of State&apos;s Council wouldbe willing to accept the findings of the proposed inquiry, and undertook to ascertain this definite jThe Secretary of State for War, after explaininand pressing his own proposals, eventually agreedto the suggested Inquiry.?hn Chancellor   of the Exchequer said that hewas prepared to abide by the findings of theproposed Inquiry.   Important as were the financial considerations involved, he attached even greater importance to the larger questions of policy.Mr Churchill referred to the burden which themaintenance of a large Army in India placed onthis country, both from a financial and more general point of view.The Cabinet recognised that the Secretary ofState &apos;or India and the Government of India had made a great advance on their previous attitude.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  fa) That, the whole basis of the- capitation payments, includingthe War Office claims and the counter-claims of the Governmentof India, should be referredimmediately to an independent tribunal:(b) That ^Tie composition and termsof reference to the tribunal should be arranged between theSecretary of State for India   the;Secretary of State for War and
the Secretary of State for Air,who, if they were unable to agree,should discuss the matter with the Lord Chancellor.    Their Report-would be made to the Prime Minister,who &apos;-would   appoint the Tribunal:(c) That the Secretary of State forIndia should ascertain whetherthe Government of India wereprepared to abide by the decisionof the Tribunal, and also whether,in connection with the appointmentof the Indian Statutory Commission,any understanding had been reached that a financial matter of thiskind necessarily came within itspurvie w, and whe th er the Gov ern-ment o-f India would not be willingto dissociate the new Inquiry fromthe Simon Commission.If any real difficulty arose onthis aspect of the question, LordPeel was ashed to report to theCabine t..
the LOTTOOTT 4.. The Cabinet had before the- 3 MemorandumTRAFFIC PILLS.(Paper CP.-28 (29)) by the Minister of transport i /pr^&apos;io-0 3 cover inn a Report dated February 5,    1929, by therefore &apos;orenc e;Cabinet 4- London Traffic Advisory Committee on t&quot;r0 Bills(28), Con-clusion 5(d) .)    promoted respectively by the London County Counciland the London Electric Railway Company to empowerthose bodies to enter into agreements with eachother and with other London transport agenciesfor the co-ordination of operations.    In his memorandum the Minister of Transport reminded theCabinet, that in their Blue Report of July, 1927,the. London Traffic Advisory Committee had recom-tended the introduction of a Government Bill togive effect to the comprehensive scheme for thefutur^ control and management       London Trafficset out in that Report.   Tbe Cabinet, however, had decided that tire for such a Bill could not befound (Cabinet 4 (28)  Conclusion 5(c)), and theLondon County Council and the Company had accord-ingly agreed to try to obtain   powers for a partial measure of co-ordination pending thepassare of a Government measure dealing with thecomplete scheme.    A. majority of the London TrafficAdvisory Committee favoured the passage of thePills subject to certain amendments which the promoters are understood to be willing to accept.The Bills, however, will be opposed by the LabourParty and by the Main Line Railway Companies.In vie1&quot; of tho urgency of the question, tbe impro-bability o* any Government being able to legislate in the neer future, and the importance of theinterests represented by the two Pills, tbeMinister of Transport invited the Cabinet toauthorise him (a) to publish the recent Report
from &quot;his Advisory Committee before that date;( b) to infovrr. the TJouse that the Qovemmentconsider that the two Bills should be accordedSecond Reaiin? and sent to a Select Committee.The Caline4&quot;  agreed  (a)  That the Minister of transport should be authorised to take action in accordance with his proposals:(t)  That the Prime Minister and theMinister of Transport should speak to the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury and ask him to use his good offices in order to induce as many members as possible to supportthe Bills promoted by the LondonCounty Council and the Undergroundgroup&quot; o f Companies when introduced,although of course the Whips couldnot b0 put on officially;Co) That when referred to a SelectCommittee the Government should exercise no pressure.
THE GAP U1TDEH- 5. The Cabinet had before their a Memorandum bytha President of the Hoard of Trade  (Paper C.P.-/Fr7GS PILL.(previous 36 (29)) cover in?? the draft Gas Undertakings Pill,Reference cabinet 55 the obiect. of which is to confer greater freedom(28), Con-elusion 5.)       in certain respects on the Gas Industry than itenjoys under existing legislation.    The provisionsof the Pill have,  in accordance with theCabinet Conclusion mentioned in the margin, been strictly limited to the non-controversial mattersdescribed in the covering Memorandum, and the early introduction of the Pill is highly desirable in theandinterests of the industry,/for political and other reasons .The President of the Board of Trade explainedthat he had been authorised by the Prime Ministerto confer with the Ministers principally concerned and to submit the Bill direct to the Cabinet without-previous consideration by the Committee of HomeAffairs.The Cabinet agroed  That the President of the Board ofTrade should be authorised to arrangefor r,he introduction forthwith inthQ House of   Lords   of the GasUndertakings Bill in the form ofthe dra^t annexed to Paper C.F.-35  (29), with a view to the passageof the Bill into law during thepresent Session, but on the under-standing that its &quot;    progressin the House of Commons must dependon its being treated as uncontrover-s ial.NOTE. The attention of the President of the Board of Tradewas drawn to an error in. the marginal description of clause 2 of the Bill, which should be as follows:-&quot;Undertakers authorised to borrow to anamount not exceeding half paid-up. capital&quot;(in iieu of &quot;nominal&quot; capital as in the printed copy.)The President was also asked to make sure that the drafting,;6f Clause 6 (3) was correct.
THE POSITION OP 6 . The Cabinet had before them a memorandum the COUNSELLORSOF STATE IN by the Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsRELATION to dominion (Pap^r C.F.-30 (29)) covering copies of a despatchMATTERS .from the Irish Free State Government-, and of his reply enclosing a Memorandum on the position ofthe Counsellors of State in relation ^o Dominionmatters.    The terms of the Memorandum in question had been concurred in, previous to its despatch tothe Fr^e State Government, by the Lord Chancellor,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theHome Secretary .After a full explanation of the circumstances in which His Majesty had appointed the Counsellorsof State, the Memorandum stated that, in order toavoid even the appearance of an infringement of theConstitutional doctrine that the Counsellors ofState can only act whT. dealing with matters concerning a Dominion upon the advice given to themby the Ministers of the Dominion concerned, it hadbeen arranged that documents relating to anyDominion should,  during ^is  Majesty&apos;s illness, be signed by Her Majesty the Ojueen, the Prince of wales and the Duke of York,  and not by any one ofthe other three Counsellors of State.It was also pointed out that the Counsellors ofState had acted on His Majesty&apos;s behalf in matters relating to all the other Dominions on the advice in each case of the Dominion Government concerned,and that no other Dominion had raised any question as to the authority for or propriety of such actionTh0  Cabinet took note of and approved the action taken by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs in thematter.
DOMINION INSTRU-        7 . The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumMENTS OP RATIFI-FTCATION AND       by the Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsTHE &quot;BSE OP THEGREAT SEAL. (Paper CP.-24 (29))  explaining that, in viewof doubts entertained by the Free State Government(previous reference:     re^ardine the present procedure respecting theCabinet 37(28), Con-     preparation of instruments of ratification of elusion 6(b) .)Treaties in respect of the Dominions, and especially as to the use of the Great Seal,  a statement on thesubject had been prepared and agreed by him, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and had then been sent to the Irish Free State Government.After reference to the Proceedings of theImperial Conferences of 1923 and 1926, the state-ment in question explained the formal procedureemployed in cases when a Dominion Government advise his Majesty to ratify a Treaty on behalf of that dominion, and concluded with the following expres-sion of the views of the British Government:-&quot;... the fact that certain action by united Fimdom Ministers is called for in connection with the ratifica-tion of a Treaty on behalf of a dominion does not give them any measure of control over the Govern-ment of that Dominion in connectionwith the Treaty concerned, nor involve anysubordination : of the Dominion Govern-ment to the Government in the UnitedKingdom in this respect .    Once a dominion Government has advised MisMajesty to ratify a Treaty on behalfof that Dominion, T-Tis Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment in. the United Kingdom do notroqard themselves as at liberty toadvise ^*is Majesty to the contraryeffect;    any Inter-Imperial questionswhich may arise in connection with theTreaty should have been previouslydisposed of by consultation under tteearrangements as to the negotiation of treaties contained in the 1926 Report&quot;.The Cabinet took no-e of and approved the termsof the^ statement sent to the Free State Govem-ment.
THE LOCAL 8. The Cabinet had be lb re them a  -emor andumGOV^RNr^NW1(SCOTLAND) by the Secretary       State for Scotland tPaper C.P.-BTLIi   -CLAUSE 17 -        SR (29)) on the subject of the Payment of AllowancesPAYMENT OPALLOWANCES to cover Loss of Time in the case of Members of by COUNTYCOUNCILS. -   Scottish County Authorities.In accordance with the previous decision of the(previousPeference: Cabinet, Clause 1? of the Local Government ^Scotland)Cabinet 4-9(28), Con-        Bill had been re-drafted so as to limit the powerclusion 11.)to incur expenditure to payment of members ofCounty Authorities of necessary travelling expenses and allowances other than payment ^or lost time.In Committee, Scottish Members of all Parties had strongly pressed that the Clause should be extendedto cover such payments.    In view of the strongfeelins in the T&apos;ouse and the fears entertained that under the Clause, as drafted, working men would inpractice be excluded from membership of CountyCouncils, the Secretary of State for Scotland had undertaken to reconsider the question before theReport Stage,  and he now -urged that the concession should be granted, but should be limited to theCounty Authorities, which in Scotland cover wide areas where transport, is slow and difficult.The Minister of Health said that already he hadreceived a Private Notice Question asking if hewould re-commit his Local Government Bill in orderthat similar proposals might be discussed, but hethought nevertheless that he could hold his ownso far as the English Bill was concerned.   Heemphasized that there was no logical difference,as regards payment **or broken time,   between timegiven to County Councils and to Town Councils.we could understand the importance of travelling expenses, especially in cases where a man might
have to incur hotel costs.    Working cen&apos;s represen-tatives claimed that there was a difference becauseCounty Council&quot;,  work was undertaken by day and town Council work by night.   As a matter of fact,however,  Committees of Town Councils usuallyworked in the day.   Everyone who undertook publicwork had to make some sacrifice.    The tendency towards payment for compensation, and so forth,was to professionalise this work.   He wished theCabinet to realise this.   At the same time Mr neville chamberlain realised the peculiar difficulties ofthe Secretary of State for Scotland, and said hewould not oppose the concession.The Cabin-&apos;-b agreed  (a) That the proposals of the Secretaryof State for Scotland   containedin CP.-38 (29)  should be approved:(b) That the Minister of Health shouldbe authorised to stand firm asregards applying these concessions to &quot;the English Bill.(
THE AGE OP 9.The Home Secretary invited the Cabinet, asMARRIAGEBILL. a matter of -urgency, to consider the question of(Previous the Age of Marriage Bill to be introduced in the reference-:Cabinet 54 House of Lords by Lord Buckm aster on Tuesday next,(28), Oon-clusion 11.)        February 19,  1929.The Cabinet were reminded that at a meeting ofthe Committee of Home Affairs held on November 23,1928 (H.A.C. 13th Conclusions (28),  Mnute 2),  theCommittee had had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (Paper f .A    24 (28)) covering thedraft Age of Marriage Bill, the object of whichwas to effect certain amendments in the law relat-ing to the age of marriage.    Objection had, however been raised to the Bill by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, and the Committee had ultimatelyadopted a suggestion of the Lord Chancellor thatthe interests in favour of reform should arrangefor the introduction in the House of Lords of aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill, preferably in the form ofthe Home Secretary&apos;s draft Bill, and that prior toits Second Reading the Cabinet should be invitedto determine the Government&apos;s attitude towards theBill.    This course had been followed, and it was now necessary for the Cabinet to decide the line to be taken in regard to Lord Buckmaster&apos;s Bill.While recognising that the raising of the ageof marriage presented greater difficulties thanappeared at first sight, the general view of theCabinet was in favour of the proposal, not onlyon merits but also owing to the internationalinterest 3hown in the question at the League ofNa,t&apos;ions .The Lord Privy Seal was asked, while not&apos; concealing the difficulties, to indicate a generally^favourable attitude on behalf of theGov government en t *
