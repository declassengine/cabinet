- THE BUDGET. 1. The Cabinet had a short discussion onthe procedure on Budget and Supply before9    (previous reference: dissolution.Cabinet 45(28), Con- A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the elusion 10)Exchequer and the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury was handed round and collectedafter the Meeting.The arrangements in this Memorandum were approved.   A copy is on record with theSecretary&apos;s file copy of the Cabinet Conclusions.)-1-
2. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the proposal for an Inquiryby a Royal Co&apos; mission or other body into the Ironand Steel Industry:-A copy of&apos; a letter from the general secretary to the Iron and Steel TradesConfederation to the Prime Minister(Paper CP.-20 (29)) urging the settingup of a Royal Commission or othercompetent Committee to make a full and impartial inquiry into the Iron andSteel Industry:a Memorandum by the Ministry of Labour(Paper CP .-21 ( 29)) favouring theappointment of an ad, hoc Committeeprovided both sides engaged in theindustry, namely,  the Employers&apos;organisations and the Iron and SteelTrades Confederation, unite in asking for it: and covering a draft of a reply to Mr Pugh&apos;s letter:A memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (Paper C.P.-23 (29))proposing an amendment to the draftof a reply making clear that no Dutycould be imposed in the lifetime ofthe present Parliament.In the course of the discussion it transpired that some doubt existed in the minds of several members of the Cabinet as to the precise scope ofthe proposed Inquiry.    Some members had thoughtit was a mere anticipation, in order to save time,of the Safe-guarding Inquiry which had been promisedin the next Parliament if the present Governmentare returned to power and if an application wasmade.    It was explained, however, that this wasnot the case.    &quot;hat the Iron and Steel TradesConfederation desired was an Inquiry into certain points which they believed would not be covered bythe Report of   Sir Arthur balfour&apos;s Committee on industry and Trade .   Even if the Inquiry took place an applic-tion mi^ht very probably be made by theEmployers&apos;  Organisations for a Safeguarding Inquiryafter the Election, and to refuse it on the ground of the Inquiry now asked for having taken place-2-
might be regarded as an act of bad faith.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed  That the r^ply to the Iron and SteelTrades Confederation should be  to theeffect that the general conditions ofthe industry have already been investi-gated very fully by Sir Arthur balfour&apos;sCommittee on Industry and Trade;    thatthe Government have promised that ifreturned to power they will allow theIron and Steel Industry to make anapplication under the Safeguarding ofIndustries Procedure after the GeneralElection;    and that in these circum-stances no good purpose would appearto be served by establishing a freshInquiry at th^ present time.
DOMINIONMINISTER S .definition of Functionsof.(previous reference e:Cabinet 54-(28),  Con-clusion 6.)Eg.  TS^O&apos;/3 .The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(Paper C.P.-22 (29)) proposing the adoption ofthe Canadian amended form of Note which deviatesbut little from that suggested as the result ofa Cabinet decision of December 5th, referred toin the margin,  and recommending that after obtain-ing the assent of Australia and New Zealand, weshould use the desire of the Canadian, Union and free State Governments to appoint Ministers atonce as a lever towards getting the two lastnamed Governments to agree to the Canadian formula.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.-4-
TT-TE CHANNELTUNNEL.Form of inquiry .(PreviousRefereno e:Cabinet 3(29),  Con-conclusion 4.)4.The Prime Minister suggested that the ChannelTunnel Inquiry should be conducted on the following lines:-(i) The Inquiry-shouldbe conduc ted bya Joint Session of the Committee ofImperial Defence and the Committeeof Civil Research:(ii) T&apos;r Ramsay Mac&apos;Donald and Mr Lloyd Georgeshould be given the option of bringinga colleague to the meetings with them.This would be in accordance with the1924 arrangement, when ex-Presidentsof the Committee of Imperial Defencewere invited, which gave two to theConservative Party and two to the liberals:iii)  The Government representatives, besides the Ministers who normally attend meet-ings of the Committee of Imperial Defence,should include the Home Secretary, thePresident of the Board of Trade, theMinister of Labour,  the Minister ofAgricultureMinister ofand Fisheries, and theTransport.The Cabinet approved the above proposals-5-
CANADA ANDTHE LEAGUEOP NATIONS.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(28),  Con-elusion 4 .)5.The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(Paper CP.-18 (29)) covering a letter from theHigh Commissioner of Great Britain in Canadaon the subject of a speech by the canadian minister of Railways regarding the position ofCanada in relation to the League, to the effectthat the League of Nations was pulling its weight;was slowly and by infinite courtesy building upa spirit of co-operation and good will amongnations?    and was of importance to Canada as wellas to Great Britain, because,even if its political activities might seem to be largely concernedwith Europe, no member of the Eritish Commonwealthof Nations could remain unaffected by difficultieswhich affect another member of the group.-6-
Afghanistan TAN.Kabul - Fvac-Jl^uation Opera-&quot;IPtions at.(previous reference e:Cabinet 2(29), Con-elusion 2 .)6. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air (Paper C .1.-19 (29))covering extracts from private letters receivedfrom Sir Geoffrey Salmcnd, the Air Officer Command-ins in India, describing the course of the recentevacuation operations at Kabul.
CABINET  -PROCEDURE.(previous reference:Cabinet 59(2k),  Con-clusion 1) ,7.    Arising out of tire two previous items the question was raised at the Cabinet as  towhat principle was adopted in placing papers on the Cabinet Agenda to be taken note of.      SomeDepartments,  it was pointed out,   the ForeignOffice,  for example,  circulate a very largenumber of documents, some of the greatest import-ance, which are never taken note of at all.The suggestion was made that Ministers mighthave the documents circulated from their Departmentsscrutinised more carefully before a CP. number is asked for,  in order to avoid overloading theCabinet Agenda with matters which are only sent for information,,, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.February 6,  1929.-8-
[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GjOVEPJMJNTj .SECRET. Copy No.CAB  I N E T.PROCEDURE ON THE BUDGET AND SUPPLY BEFORE DISSOLUTION.Joint Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thjParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.1.      The 3udget.The general resolution to amend the lav/ which permitsof the moving of new clauses in a Finance Bill should be avoidedbefore dissolution in order to prevent the bringing forward bythe opposition of numerous amendments of a window-dressing nature.It could be avoided by postponing the Finance Bill proper until after the General Election.In this event it would be essential before Dissolutionto authorise the continued collection of the expiring taxes(Tea duty,  Income Tax and possibly Hops)  and although the budget speech will contain a full statement of the Chancellor of theExchequer^ proposals for 1929*  the Bill which will follow theBxidget speech would be restricted to these items.2.      Business of Supply.Before Easter the normal procedure should be followedso as to avoid any disclosure of the Governments intentions as to the date of dissolution until the introduction of theBudget.      After Easter an attempt should be made to obtain anagreement with the Opposition parties to conclude beforedissolution the remaining business of Supply in a reducednumber of allotted days.      If such an agreement is not possiblethe Government would have,.before dissolution,  to bring forwardVotes on Account for each of the Fighting Services and possiblyfor Civil Services.
Provided the Eudget is dealt with as proposedthis memorandum the Parliamentary time available afterthe Easter recess (Tuesday, 9th April)  to the date ofprorogation (Friday,  10th May) would allow of either ofthese courses being adopted and might possibly permit ofan extended recess at Easter,  say until Tuesday,  16th Ap(Intd.)    W.S.C.B.E.M.5th February,  1 929.
