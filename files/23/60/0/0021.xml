1. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-136 (29))covering a statement from Sir Josiah Stamp detail-ing the problems which confronted the british delegation on the Committee of Experts on Repara-tion sitting in Paris, in regard to arrears ofparents under the Balfour Note, and the positionof the Dominions, and the line which the delgation had pursued.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer inhis Paper prefaced Sir Josiah Stamp&apos;s statement with a Note by the Treasury on the present positionin the Committee.    In this Note the Treasury statedthat the Chairman of the Committee had prepared a revised proposal based on an average annuity of 100,000,000 for 37 years, followed by annuitiescovering war debts alone for 22 years.    This pro-posal had been accepted as a basis of discussion.Since then, however, Sir Josiah Stamp had writtenthat matters had gone back to the-position in whichit was proposed that we should not only give up allarrears, but also the entire share of the Dominionsand the Colonies.    Should the Committee reach adecision in this sense, the Treasury Note added, theBritish Delegation would enter a strong reservationagainst the proposed-distribution.The.Chancellor of the Exchequer showed, byquotations from official documents, includingcommunications addressed to M. Poincare&quot; and M. PoIncare&apos;sown account of a conversation the Chancellor of theExchequer had had with him last November, how strongis the position of the British Government in itsadherence to the Spa percentages for the distributionof sums received from Germany on account of Reparation.
Mr Churchill emphasised! however, that the momenthad not yet arrived for publicly stressing thisfeature of the situation.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should reply the same afternoon to aQuestion addressed to him on thesubject in the House of Commons asfollows&quot; Sir,The Committee of Experts nowsitting in Paris is composed of independent representatives ofthe various countries concerned.We have of course kept in touchwith the British members through-out these protracted proceedings and have been impressed by theiradmirable grasp and comprehension. of the whole position.    We havenot, however, at any time sentdefinite instructions to thesegentlemen, nor do we propose todo so on this occasion.    the expert Committee must be leftto reach their own conclusions.These conclusions, whatever theymay be and whether agreed or not ,in no way commit His Majesty1 sGovernment, which remains entirelyfree to review the whole positionand to take their own decisionsupon the work and recommendationsof the Expert Committee.    It isclear, therefore, that no urgencyexists , and that it would be premature as well as inexpedientfor His Majesty&apos;s Government to pronounce upon particular aspects ,however important they may be , atthe present juncture.However, Sir, in order to preventmisconception abroad or alarm athome, it is perhaps desirable thatI should say that the kind of pro-posals which were foreshadowed inthe newspapers of yesterday would,in our opinion, be inacceptableand that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould in no circumstances entertainthem&quot;.(b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should draw up a communication to besent by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to the British ambassador in Paris, containing extracts from the
various documents lie had read tothe Cabinet in conneotion with themaintenance of the Spa percentages,not fur present publication but for sir William Tyrrell to use in conversation with the French ForeignOffice.
CO-ORDINATIONOP british policy ATINTERNATIONALCONFERENCES ANDTHE ASSEMBLYOF THE LEAGUEOF NATIONS.2. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper CP. -138 (29)) covering the draft of a letter in whichthe Foreign Office suggest to the various otherDepartments concerned the formation of a Standing   ,Inter-Departmental Committee in order to secure a closer co-ordination of British policy at Inter-national Conferences, and particularly at theAssembly of the League of Nations, than exists today.The President of the Board of Trade, in assentingto the formation of the proposed Standing Inter-Departmental Committee, asked that this should notbe allowed to interfere with the existing practiceunder which, when the subject of a Conference isEconomic, an Inter-Departmental Conference is summon-ed by and presided over by Sir Sydney Chapman, theEconomic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government.The First Lord of the Admiralty,  in accepting the proposal, asked particularly that matters relating to Defence or Disarmament should continueto be referred to the Committee of Imperial Defenceor its appropriate Sub-Committees, or to theDisarmament Policy Committee of the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs expressed the hope, first, that the new StandingCommittee should not interfere with the Committeeon Inter-Imperial Relations, presided over bySir Hubert Montgomery, which was making good progress;   and, second, that any representative ofor-the Dominions who might be present in London^on his way to Geneva should be eligible to attend theCommittee if this course was deemed desirable.The Secretary of State for India hoped that India,
though separately represented at the Assembly atGeneva, might he allowed to co-operate in theproposed Committee.The Minister of Labour said that his department was much interested in the proposal and warmlysupported it.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that sir Maurice Hankey had made a similar proposalsome years ago, at the time when the League ofNations Section was in the Cabinet Office, but onthat occasion it had not been adopted.The Cabinet gave general approval to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; proposalset forth in Paper CP.-138 (29), and left it tothe Secretary of State to meet the views of hiscolleagues, as summarised above, by &quot;farming out&quot;the business to existing Committees or other government machinery that has been created for thepurpose of co-ordination.
^J^SfSS 5*    Tiis Cabinet had before them the followingBAGHDAD-haifa railway Aid        documents in connection with the Oil position inPIPELINE.Iraq and the proposed trans-desert pipeline and(Previous railway to the Mediterranean:-Reference:Cabinet 18 A Memorandum by the Secretary of(29), Con- State for the Colonies (Paperolusion 2.) CP.-134 (29)) in which the cabinet was asked to accept the following conclusions:-(i) that the construction of the bagadad-Haifa Railway cannotbe assured without financialassistance from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment:(ii) that financial assistance shouldtake the form of a contribution towards interest on capital,preferably to be found fromthe proposed Colonial Develop-ment Fund;    and(ill) that, if within the next threemonths no agreement is reached between the Iraq Government andthe Turkish Petroleum company which will ensure the carryingout of a detailed survey of the bagadad-Haifa route, His Majesty*sGovernment should themselves offer to find the funds for such as u. rvey.A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper CP.-145 (29))in which, after drawing attention toinconsistencies between statementscontained in CP.-134 (29)) and earliercontentions by the Colonial Office,Sir Austen Chamberlain placed on recordhis view &quot;that after what we have saidto the French Government it would bedishonourable henceforth to attemptto influence the decision of the Govern-ment of Iraq in any way&quot;, and in whichhe asked &quot;that the High Commissionermay be instructed in the plainest terms that, whilst His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill take whatever measures they thinkappropriate to secure the constructionof&quot; a railway and pipeline debouchingat Haifa, he is not to use any sort of pressure or personal influence to extract a decision in this sense fromthe Government of Iraq&quot;.
In the course of the discussion the Presidentof the Board of Trade described a conversation hehad had with Sir John Gadman,  the Chairman ofthe Turkish Petroleum Company.      Sir PhilipCunliffe-Lister had gathered the impression that sir John Cadman, in recent conversations with iraq Ministers,  had given them considerable food for reflection in regard to their attitude towardsthe Company.      Ministers had approached Sir Johnas to how they could obtain a loan of half amillion pounds for a bridge across the Tigris.Sir John Cadman had replied by pointing out thatif the Iraq Government would only deal fairlyand. squarely with the powerful interests who werein a position to develop the wealth in oil inthat country,  the Iraq Government would obtain a certain prospect of an income,  on the strengthof which they could raise advances far larger than that required for the bridge across the tigris, and enough,  indeed,  tc enable them to finance the Haifa railway.      As the result ofthis conversation Sir Philip Cunliffe-Listerthought it would be premature to take any decision in regard to British financial co-operation now the results of the Turkish petroleum company&apos;s negotiations with the Iraq Governmenthad become apparent.The Secretary of State .for Foreign Affairs,who had al-^o seen Sir John Cadman,  shared thisview.
In connection with his proposal that nosort of pressure or influence must &quot;be exerted, uponthe Iraq Government in connection with the route&apos;&apos; &apos;of the pipeline and railway, he quoted in full thedecisions of the Cabinet on the 20th March (Cabinet12  (29),  Conclusion p  (a)   (ii)  and (iii).The gist of these decisions,  including anundertaking that His Majesty&apos;s Government willnot put any pressure on the Government of Iraqeither to maintain or withdraw the particularcondition in regard to the survey of theHaifa route,  to which objection had been madeby the French Government, had been communicatedto the French Government on the pOth April.Sir Austen Chamberlain insisted strongly that this undertaking must be honourably observedand that the British High Commissioner at Baghdadshould be instructed accordingly.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said there was no question of the undertaking notbeing honourably observed by Sir Gilbert Clayton,and that instructions to this effect would go forward.      He pointed out, however,  that theCabinet,  on March 20th,  while deciding that nopressure should be put on the Government of Iraq,and that the French Government should be so informed, had also laid down -
&quot;that Sir- &quot;/illiam Tyrrell shouldmake it clear that His Majesty^Government does not conceal itsdesii^e for the adoption of Haifa asthe terminus of the pipeline and railway,  just as the French Governmentis known x,o prefer a Syrian port,and that they reserve their fullright to promote it by such meansas the complete or partialconstruction, a guarantee of interest,or a subsidy of a railway, or of similar methods.&quot;In these circumstances Mr. Amery presumed that sir Gilbert Clayton would be justified in notconcealing from the Iraq Government the preferencewhich His Majesty&apos;^ Government feel for the Haifaroute. Mr. Amery thought it possible that sir john Cadman nad under-rated the extent to whichche French representatives on the Turkish petroleum company&apos;s Board were subjected to political influencefrom the French Government.      He was apprehensivelest the French Government should carry out theirunconcealed intention to commence the first stage ofthe trans-desert railway from Tripoli,  in which event the pipeline would probably follow that route.      lieaccepted the view of his colleagues, however,  thatthe decision could be postponed until after theGeneral Election.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that Sir Gilbert Clayton would have to be careful not to emphasise too strongly the Britishdesire for the Haifa route,  as if he did so the IraqGovernment might refrain from making any financialefforts themselves in the expectation that His Majesty&apos;
&quot;that Sir- Villiam Tyrrell shouldnaive it clear that His Hajesty^sGovernment does not conceal itsdesiiie for the adoption of Haifa asthe terminus of the pipeline and railway,  just as the French Governmentis known ro prefer a Syrian port,and that they reserve their fullright to promote it by such meansas the complete or partialconstruction, a guarantee of interest,or a subsidy of a railway, or of similar methods.&quot;In these circumstances Mr, Amery presumed that sir Gilbert Clayton would be justified in notconcealing from the Iraq Government the preferencewhich His Majesty&apos;s Government feel for the Haifaroute. Mr. Amery thought it possible that sir john Caconan had under-rated the extent to whichche French representatives on the Turkish petroleum company&apos;s Board were subjected to political influencefrom the Prench Government.      He was apprehensivelest the French Government should carry out theirunconcealed intention to commence the first stage ofthe trans-desert railway from Tripoli, in which event the pipeline would probably follow that route.      Heaccented the view of his colleagues, however,  thatthe decision could be postponed until after theGeneral Election.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that Sir Gilbert Clayton would have to be careful not to emphasise too strongly the Britishdesire for the Haifa route, as if he did so the IraqGovernment might refrain from making any financialefforts themselves in the expectation that His Hajesty&apos;s
Government would build, the railway.After considerable discussion,  the cabinet agreed -(a) That pending the development of thenegotiations between the TurkishPetroleum Company and the IraqGovernment,  it would be inadvisablefor the Cabinet to take any decision regarding financial assistance fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government towards the bagadad-Haifa railway;(b) That the question ought to be taken up by the Government after theGeneral Election;(c) That the High Commissioner of Iraqshould be instructed that, whileHis MajestyTs Government will takewhatever measures they thinkappropriate to secure theconstruction of a railway and pipe-line debouching at Haifa, he isnot to use any sort of pressureor personal influence to induce theIraq Government to impose thispolicy upon the Turkish petroleum company.
With reference to Conclusion 4j I am directed by the Prime Minister to informmembers of the Cabinet that, after consult-ation with responsible officials of theCentral Office and after a esarefulre-examination in all its bearings ofthe question of the action to be takenin regard to the Report of the Committeeon Woollen and Worsted, he is preparedto adopt the view of the majority of hiscolleagues.In these circumstances the Prime Ministerdoes not consider it necessary to summon a further Meeting of the Cabinet.(Signed) M.P.A.HANKEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 9, 1929.
safeguarding of industries the woollen and textile industry.(previous reference e:Cabinet 19(29)    Con-elusion 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (paper c.P.-137 (29)) covering the Report of a Committeeappointed under the Safeguarding of industries procedure to consider the Woollen and WorstedIndustries.   The Report contained recommendations for a specific Duty on garments containingwoollen or worsted fabrics on a scale sufficientto cover the material in them, the suggestedrange being from 6d. an article on garments theimport value of which is 10/- and under, up to amaximum of 3s.6d. in the case of garments valued at  4 and over.   -A long discussion took place.    There was generalagreement that, but for the approach of the GeneralElection, provision would have been made in theFinance Bill? in accordance with the recommenda-tions of the Committee.    The discussion centredmainly round the question of whether an announce-ment should be made of the Government1b policybefore the General Election, and, in the event ofsuch an announcement, whether the Report of theCommittee should be published.    The trend of opinion was in favour of the publication of the Report if anannounceJment of the Government1 s policy was made,but not otherwise.    It was pointed out, however,that in cases where the Government had decided on a duty on the recorrmendation of a Committee appointed under the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure, thenormal practice *was not to make an announcement andnot to publish&apos; the Report until immediately beforethe insertion of fthe necessary provision ,in theFinanoe Bill and its discussion in Parliament.
The object of this procedure was to avoid thedumping of goods in this country and the conse-quential frustration of the objects of the Dutyfor a period of months.A discussion of this question in its economioand political aspects revealed that, while mostof the members of the Cabinet felt that thearguments were somewhat evenly balanced, therewas a majority in favour of adherence to thenormal procedure and of an announcement being madeto the following effect:- that the Government didnot feel justified in deviating from the usualcourse merely because a General Election was approaching;   that the Report was being carefully considered by the Government;   that no decisionhad been taken, but that in the event of theimposition of a Duty being deemed desirable anannouncement would be made in Parliament only just before action could be taken to put the decisioninto effect, so as to render it impossible forimporters to anticipate the decision and destroy the effect of the Duties during the first year.This announcement might be completed by reoallingthe Governments statement to the effect that nomanufacturing industry will be debarred frompresenting its case before the Tribunal.The Prime Minister said he would like time forfurther reflection and examination of this subject in its political aspects.    If this further consid-eration should lead him to a different view fromthat of the majority of his colleagues he wouldsummon a further Meeting of the Cabinet.
THE INTER-national labour CON-FERE NCE  ELEVENTHSESSION.Minimum Wage-fixingMachinery.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(28), Con-clusion 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-130 (29)) submit-ting proposals as to the action to be taken by theGovernment in regard to the Draft Convention and recommendation adopted by the Eleventh Session ofthe International Labour Conference concerning thecreation of Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery.    TheDraft Convention imposes no obligations   other thanthose already imposed by existing legislation InGreat Britain, and the Minister of Labour therefore recommended its immediate and unconditional ratifi-cation by His Majesty1 s Government.    The Recommenda-tion contained a number of detailed suggestions asto the methods to be adopted in the application ofthe Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery, and the Ministerof Labour proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould accept the recommendation, with the exceptionof the following stipulation in Paragraph 2 (a) ofA.II, whioh lays down that independent persons appointed to a wage-fixing body &quot;should, as far as&quot;possible, be selected in agreement with or after&quot;consultation with the Employers1 ard Workers&apos; repre-&quot;sentatives on the wage-fixing body&quot;.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Labour.
THE INTER-NATIONALLABOURCONFERENCE- TENTHSESSION.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(28), Con-clusion 7,)6. Tbe Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-131 (29)) onthe subject of the proposed action on Draft convention-tions and Recommendations of the Tenth Session ofthe International Labour Conference, 1927.    The twoDraft Conventions concerned (i) Sickness Insuranoefor Workers in Industry and Coiomeroe and domestic servants; and (ii) Sickness Insurance for Agricul-tural Workers.    The slight amendment of the HealthInsurance Acts necessary to bring them into conform-ity with the requirements of these Conventions hadbeen made, although a practical and constitutionaldifficulty had arisen in regard to Northern Ireland,which had been indicated by Sir Walter Kinnear whenvoting for the Convention on behalf of the BritishGovernment.    The Minister of Labour therefore pro-posed to issue a White Paper stating that, owing tothe fact that the system for providing medical benefit in Northern Ireland is not directly associa-ted with the Insurance Scheme, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment do not see their way for the present to ratifythese Conventions, although full effect was being given to them in Great Britain.   With regard to theRecommendation concerning the General Principles of sickness Benefit, Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland statedthat there was no objection to its terms, and he therefore proposed that It should be accepted.In the course of a short discussion it was suggested that it would be better not to issue a White paper on the subject at the present time.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Labour shouldhave authority to ratify the Conven-tions before the General Election if in the meantime the-.Government ofNorthern Ireland expressed a readiness
to take the necessary steps toenable them to carry out the conventions.Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland under-took to keep in close touch withthe Home Secretary and LordLondonderry with a view to securing the co-operation of theGovernment of Northern ireland in this policy as soon as theirElection was over.
DRAFT CONVEN-TION CONCERN-ING seamen SARTICLES OFAGREEMENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(28), Con-clusion 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-143 (29)) onthe subject of the Draft Convention concerningSeamen&apos;s Articles of Agreement.    The Memorandumstated that the Draft Convention was in completeconformity with our existing legislation exceptin regard to one point of detail contained inArticle 5, which provided that the documents to beissued to every seaman containing a record of his employer on &quot;board a vessel should not contain any statement as to the quality of his work..   Artiole 14of the Convention provided for the issue to theseaman of a separate character report, if desired.The Minister of Labour proposed that the DraftConvention should be ratified at once, but thatattached to the ratification there should be adeclaration in the terms set out in Paper CP.-143(29), with which the Board of Trade, as the Depart-nent immediately concerned, were in agreement.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Labour.-16-
