THE KELLOGG- I. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsPACT.informed the Cabinet that he was anxious that(Previous the Felloes Peace Pact should be ratifiedRef reference e&apos;Cabinet 3^ simultaneously by the whole British Empire.(28),  Con-clusion 6.) He had asked the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to ascertain what was the earliest date on which the whole of the Dominions would beready to ratify.    Sir Austen Chamberlain addedthat he had been informed officially that theUnited States of America had ratified withoutany qualification or reservation whatsoever,and that the Report of the Foreign AffairsCommittee of the Senate was of no effect inter-nationally.   In any event the Report amounted tothe same thing as Mr Kellogg s interpretation ofthe Pact, which corresponded with our own.   As-joon as the rest of the Empire were ready, SirAus t en pro po s e d to ratify .
iff!   &apos;RUSSIA. 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs^Relations with. drew attention to Questions ir! Parliament which provided evidence of a movement in favour of a( previous reference: rapprochement with Russia.   He himself had cabinet 52(28), Con- replied by referring to a statement mad0 by the elusion 6.)Prime Minister at the Guildhall.   Putting aside for the r-:o--ent the question o^ the payment ofdebts, Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s line had beenthat before any change in our relations withRussia oould take place we must be assured thatpractices of which we had eorvplained had ceased.He was anxious to know, however, whether theCabinet still felt that it was undesirable thatwe should renew relations with Russia?The Cabinet agreed that this was still their general attitude.Sir Austen Chamberlain then referred to some evidence he had received from Swedish sources(which was not wholly confirmed from other sources) to the effect that conditions in Russiawere so serious that in the Spring there Fighteven be a tendency for some portions of Russia,such as the Ukraine and Petrograd, to break away from the Union o^ Soviets.
*   a   oTHE CHANNEL 3.    The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTIHSnSRL.reported that he had received a personal letter(Previous from the French Ambassador informing hirr. thatHe f e renc n:Cabinet 39 the French Government retrained in favour of the(24),  Con-clusion 19.)       proposed construction of a Channel Tunnel andwere ready to conclude an agreement on thesubject at any time i* the British Governmentshould alter their view.The Prir-e Minister drew attention to a Private -Notice Question which had been put down for theHouse of Commons on the following day, asking for an early discussion on the Channel Tunnel.The Lord Privy Seal stated that the question was to be raised in the House of Lords on Thursdaynext .The Cabinet were informed that the secretary had prepared a summary o^ the previous Inquirieson the question, which could be circulated withina f ew days .After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of the ChannelTunnel should be re-examined,  asin 1924, from a non-Party pointof view,  and that the Leaders ofthe Opposition in the House ofCommons should be asked to take part in any Inquiry on the subject:(b) That fuller investigation shouldbe made than in the past of thefinancial, economic and transportaspects of the question:(c ) That the replies by the PrimeMinister to the Question in theHouse of Commons, by the lord privy Seal in the House of Lordu,and by Sir Austen Chamberlain tothe French Ambassador,  should be,to the above effect .The precise nature of ttt^ Inquiry was not finally decided.    The inclination was to remitit to the Committee of Imperial Defence, whichmight set up separate Committees on the defence and Eqpnomic aspects respectively.
afghanistan.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had nothing to add to the numerous telegrams that had been circulated in regard to the position in afghanistan, but he expressed his warm apprecia-tion of the splendid work o^ the Royal Air Forcein bringing away women and children ^rom Kabul.-4-(previous reference:Cabinet 58(28),   Con-clusion 16 .)I
* m xCHINA. 5. The President of the Board of trade the Commercial        informed the Cabinet that, after concluding:Treaty .a Commercial Treaty, the Chinese now proposed(Irevious to divide China into seven areas, in each ofReference: a^. **-jL*cU-u^^-Cabinet 52 which there would be a different tariff.    This(28)    Con-clusion 11.) deprived the Treaty of much       its value, andraised the question as to whether it ought to be ratified.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the matter would depend upon theextent of control which the Central Governmentwas able to exercise over China.-5-
IRISF FREESTATE.compensation claims -underArticle X ofthe Articleso f Agre ei? en t,1921.(previous reference:Cabinet 52(28),  Con-clusion 10.)6. The Chancellor o* the Exchequer reportedthat he and the Secretary of State for DominionA&apos;f fairs had held a Conference with representativesof the Irish Free State Government in regard tothe compensation claims of transferred CivilServants under Article X of the Articles ofAgreement, 1921.    The result of the conference had benn an Agreement, on the following lines:-(l) In the case of Transferred CivilServants who before the 18thDecember 19 28 have either(a) already been awarded compen-sat ion under the provisions ofArticle X of the Treaty, or(b) given notice of resignation,any extra payment which the FreeState Government will rrake inorder- to give effect to thedecision of the Privy Council inthe case of &quot;iVigg and Cochranewill be recouped by the BritishGov government ent.(2) In the case of Transferred CivilServants not covered by (l) above,the Free State are negotiatingrevised conditions on the basisof application of the treasury minute of 20th March 1922 .    Inthe event of an agreement being reached with these officerseffect will be given to it byconcurrent legislation in GreatBritain and the Free State.
7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reportedthat he and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs had conferred with representatives ofthe Irish Froe State on the subject of theSilver Currency in. the Irish Free State, as wellas the question o* &quot;dead Notes&quot;.   One smallpoint in regard to the maximurr proportion of silver       500 fineness to be permitted in theinstalments had been left to be discussed by theMint with an Irish representative.   Apart fromthis minor point, agreement had been reached onthe following lines:-(l) The British Government undertake topurchase at face value, silver to the face value of  750,0 00 in thefollowing instalments:-Before 31st March 1929  50,000In April 1929  100,000and the remaining  600,000 by tenannual instalments o?  60, 000commencing in April 1930.(2) The Irish Free State Government agreethat in putting its new silver coinsinto circulation, it will withdraw fromBanks or private persons in the FreeState, British silver of an equivalentface value.    On this basis it wouldprobably prove unnecessary for theBritish Government to introduce legis-lation to prevent the return of Britishsilver from the Free State to Great-Britain or Northern Ireland, but theBritish Government reserve the right-to introduce such legislation if atany time in their judgment it isnecessary to protect their interests.(3) An arrangement will be reached betweenthe two Governments setting out themaximum proportion of silver of 500fineness which may be included in theinstalments by reference to theprobable proportion at the present timeof silver o   500 fineness to thetotal British silver in the Free State.(4) Dead Notes.   The view of the BritishGovernment is that the Currency Corn-mission should make its apportionmentsupon such a formula as would have the
effect of excluding Dead Notesfrom any Free State charge.vr Blythe, before committing himself,  desired to examine theeffect o^ the Irish Free Statelaw,  and the probable amountsinvolved:    but undertook toconsider the arguments putforward by the British Govern-ment, with a view so far asmisht be found possible,  to reaching an agreed solutionacceptable to that Government.
NAVAL OON-STOUCTIONPROGRAMME .Anno unc err entroyardingthe CruiserType .(previous reference:Cabinet 58(20),  Con-c lu s ion 1.)8.       The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded his colleagues that at their last Meeting inthe old year the Cabinet had agreed that theprogramme already approved for the constructionof two Class nA&quot; Cruisers of IC,000-tons, with3-inch guns, to be laid down in the financialyear 1928-29,  should stand, but that  tenders inconnection therewith should not be sent out until after the Meeting of the Cabinet immediately before Parliament meets, and subject to theright of members to reopen the question of theconstruction of these Cruisers in the event ofsome new factor arising out of events in Americain connection with the passage of their CruiserBill.   The only new factor which had arisen inAmerica was the ratification by the United Statesof the Eellog? Peace Pact.    The Cruiser bill had not yet been dealt with by the Senate, andin these circumstances Mr Churchill asked thatthe time-limit laid down by the Cabinet in thedecision he had quoted should be extended.The First Lord of the Admiralty demurredstrongly to any further delay in placing the tenders in connection with these cruisers,as such delay would have a serious effectboth in the dockyards and in the firms inthe north of England to whom contracts wouldbe given.     Apart from this considerationMr. Bridgeman urged the inexpediency of depart-ing from the programme already approved.This programme would bring us in the matterof cruisers to the level of the &quot;/ashingtonratios as regards Japan.      To wait until the
America.is have decided their programme and thenpossibly to alter our own would be to linkup our naval strength definitely with that ofthe United States of America.In the course of the discussion it wassuggested that if the American cruiser Bill waspassed with the inclusion of the time table,and our programme in consequence remainedunaltered,  the issue of tenders so unusually late in the financial year would be cited as evidencethat we had waited to see what America intendedto do and would be regarded as a proof that thestrength of our Fleet is adjusted by theAmerican standard.On the other hand it was urged that ifthe Admiralty issued tenders at the present time it would be represented by the Government1scritics as calculated to assist the Big LfavyParty in America.;, and if  subsequently theAmerican cruiser Bill were passed with the timethe issuelimit,  the critics would say that it was due to/the tenders by the Admiralty.After considerable discussion the subject was adjourned.
PERSIAN GULPQUESTIONS ANDTHE LEAGUE of nations .f Pr evi era a reference:Cabinet 5^(23), Con-elusion 18.)AFGHANISTAN.BritishAtti tudeTowards.(previous reference:Cabinet ^8(23),  Con-clusion 16).9. The Cabinet had before therr a proposal that had been made to the Sub-Corrrritt.ee of theCommittee o^ Imperial Defence on the persian gulf, to the effect  that we ought to adopt theattitude that  the Persian Gulf was a special interest, comparable to the Monroe Doctrine,which we are not willing to submit to outsidearbitration or conciliation by the League orto any other outsidor, and to maintain ourposition,  if necessary, by force of arms.    ThePersian Gulf Sub-Committee had considered thatthis proposal raised issues of the highestpolicy, and had reported as follows  (in Paragraph38):--&quot;No doubt it would enable us to dealwith far greater freedom^ with theproblems of the Persian Gulf.    Theeffects both abroad and in homepolitics would certainly be far-reaching.    To discuss thesereactions in detail would, we feel,be beyond our terms of reference,and we refrain from making any recommendation to the Cabinet onthe subject:    but we think theCabinet should consider it inall its bearing&quot; .The proposal was elaborated in a noteby the Secretary of State for the Colonies,(Paper No.  CP.  ;;22  (28).      In this note itwas pointed out that strategically our interest in retaining our unchallengedsupremacy in the Persian Gulf is hardly lessthan our interest in the Suez Canal, whereashistorically our claim is much older andstronger.      So far as American public opinion was concerned,  to mention the Persian Gulfas well as the Suez Canal would create no
more trouble or suspicion than to mention oneonly, and the whole Middle Eastern area was so much smaller than the area of the monroe doctrine as to make it to American eyes remoteand unimportant.      3o far as the League was concerned we were bound to refuse the rightof the League to intervene in our relations inBgypt ov our position in the Sues Canal or inthe Sudan, and there was no reason why we shouldnot assert our claim in the Persian Gulf also,where our historical claims are even stronger.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsafter pointing ou&apos;c that Persia no less thanGreat Britain was a member oi the League ofNations, made a full statement of the obligationsincurred by members under the Covenant.    (as this statement is to be circulated to theCabinet it is not reproduced here).In view of these comprehensiveobligations,  Sir Austen Chamberlain asked how itwas possible,  if a dispute in regard to theGulf were brought by Persia before the League,for us to refuse to allow the League to discuss it and insist on dealing with it in our ownmanner.      It was perfectly clear to anyone whohad knowledge of these obligations that we couldnot refuse to discuss a question relating tothe Persian Gulf, whether brought up by Persiaor as a friendly act by some other nation.      Wecould be forced    to plead our case before either the Assembly or the Council, and we were pledgednot to resort to warlike operations without
having exhausted, the Methods of conciliation laiddown in the Covenant,  if v,re could not acceptarbitration.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that our special position in Egypt was not quite   parallelto the Monroe Doctrine.      In Egypt not only didwe consider ourselves entitled to warn other-countries off interfere ice,  jusx as the UnitedStates did in America, but we also claimed tointerfere, and, possessing an army of occupation in Egypt, frequently did interfere in theinternal affairs of the country.      The basis forour claim to a special position in Egypt was mainly that Egypt is not an independent State solong as the reserved points remain unsettled,  sowe were in a position to refuse to discuss Egyptianmatters before the League,In the Persiaa Gulf, however,  our position was entirely different, and must be defended on different grounds.      Our position in the Gulfwas  that we did not assert our own right toestablish a special status for ourselves, but thatas a matter- of self-defence we must resist theaction of any other Power to acquire aspecial position.      In other words we must asa max lex- of self-defence repel any aggression against those regLons.      But if an qggressionwere made he thought it would be necessary as a first step to bring the aggression to the noticeof the League,  taking only such action as wasnecessary to safeguard ourselves against animmediate acr of aggression.      The position in
Afganistan was very similar to that in thePersian Gulfj      Qu^ position wa-o an asoortionthat it was a measure of self-defence to us torepel an aggression by another State.      Thatis to say to prevent others from interfering with the status quo.In these circulstances it appeared tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  thatwe should have no grounds for adopting theproposal to exclude I^ersian Gulf questions fromthe League of Nations.      Even if we had any grounds, however, we could not afford to do so.At home any Government that failed to carry out our engagements under the Covenant would beregarded as one whicli was not fit to be entrusted with the conduct of affairs.      In europe apolicy which could be interpreted as one of hostility to the iieape would set publicopinion against us, and deprive us of the valuableposition we at present hold as a recognised force for conciliation and the preservation of peace.The Lord Chancellor had no doubt that underthe provisions of the Covenant of the Leagueof Nations we were bound to submit Persian Gulfquestions  to the Council of the League,  and thatthe suggestions in CP.  J;22 (28) were inconsistent with our obligations under the Covenant.After a short further discussion theSecretary of State lor the Colonies, without
withdrawing from the views he had expressed inCP8  522 (28), said that as ol-oarly the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs was canals 1-e to accept this proposal, he would not press it.Whi teha 11 Gardens , S.W. 1 ,21st January,   1929.
