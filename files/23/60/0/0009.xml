14L A3v[D i. Trie Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byiSsPCKT0^0        the Minister of Transport (Paper CP. 50(29)) stating-JTSLATION -io VISIONS PdR     that a number of Local and Private Bills and Scottish-SECTIONTgkjjST COM- Provisional Orders promoted by Transport undertakingsJit ion.in the present Session, contained clauses designed toconfer on those undertakings a large measure of pro-tection against competition in respect of theirpassenger road transport services.     The RoyalCommission on Transport had raised certain grave objections       the provisions in question and hadsu^estod that the Government should take steps toprevent, or at any rate, postpone the grant of statutory powers of the nature sought until after theCommission had presented its Report.     After Intimatinghis concurrence with the viev? of the Commission, theMinister of Transport requested the Cabinet toauthorise him to move an instruction (to be framed tooover all the cases) to the Parliamentary committees which will examine the Bills that elauses of this nature which fetter the free exercise of the discretion of individual licensing authorities and limit thejurisdiction proposed in him by Section 14 (3) of theRoads Act, 1920,  should be diaalloved.The Cabinet also had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Scotland (Paper CP.56 (29)drawing attention to three recent cases in which parliament had accepted the protective principle andto the serious position in which certain ImportantScottish Transport authorities would be placed by theadoption of the Linister of Transports proposal, and suggesting that the difficulty mi&amp;ht be met by a more
limltod instruction to the Select Committees to theeffect that the pov7ers sought should be subject to review after the Royal Commission has reported or that their duration should be limited to a few yearsso as to give opportunity for their consideration inthe light of the Commission&apos;a recommendations.The Minister of Transport elaborated theproposals set forth in his Memorandum.   In regard tothe Secretary of State for Scotland&apos;s difficulty,Colonel Ashley explained that he had the power to protectmunicipal or private enterprise,which was providingefficient and economical service, against unjustifiedcompetition, and had already in certain cases exercisedthat power.The Lord Advocate, who represented the Secre-tary of State for Scotland owing to Sir John Gilmour&apos;sindisposition, said that the real difficulty arosemainly in the case of burghs, where the Corporation,owing to pressure of competition by omnibuses, wishedto switch over from, trams to omnibuses, and to preserve the traffic goodwill which it had built up and to save the ratepayers * money.   This might be sufficientlysafeguarded if the Minister of Transport, in moving the instruction proposed, could state it to be one of his main considerations, in adrinistering his discretionarypowers as to licences under the Act of 1920, to safeguard the interest of the Corporation in such a case, provided they were maintaining an adequate and reasonable service.The Minister of Transport undertook, to include a statement to this effect.In the course of the discussion a 3 aye at wasentered as tf* the importance of not using the Minister
of Transport&apos;s powers to protect municipal enterprisesagainst reasonable and legitimate private competition incases where this was not in the public interest.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of the Ministerof Transport, on the understanding thatin moving the instruction in&apos; parliament the Minister should include a statement on the lines proposed by the lord advocate:(b) That the Minister of Transport shouldconcert the text of this statement withthe Lord Advocate.
2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper CP. 52 (29)) by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, relative to the reply to be made toinquiries by Sir Arthur Shirley Benn and ColonelVaughan Morgan on certain questions relating to the affairs of the British Group of the Inter-ParliamentaryUnion, Including a representation that if the group is to continue, the grant of  300 per annum made by theBritish Government must be Increased0     After brieflysetting out the history of the Grant, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs Indicated that In his view the question of the total suspension of the grant should now be considered and that while there wouldseom to be no effective means of preventing the union and Its members from discussing difficult and delicatequestions of policy, including such issues aslimitation of naval armaments and maritime rights,there would seem to be no apparent reason why theBritish Government should facilitate the continuanceof those activities by making contributions from public funds.Subject to the approval of the Secretary ofState  -&quot;or Foreign Affairs, who was absent through ihdispo-sition, the Cabinet agreed -That the grant of  300 per annum whichhas hitherto been paid by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the British Group of theInter-Parliam entary Union should becontinued for the present, but shouldnot be increased.     The question ofceasing the grant should be re-examinedlater in the year if the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should so desire,
&apos;0BT OF 3.The Cabinet bad before them a Note (PaperJT AFRICAN(MISSION. CP. 3 (20)) by the Secretary of State for theevious Colonies covering a copy of the Report of the Eastference:binet 39(27), African Commission, and also a Memorandumnclusion 4d Appendix.      (Paper CP. 47 (29))  by the Secretary of Statesuggesting tho course of action to be taken withregard to the Report,     The more important proposalsoontained in this Memorandum may be summarised asfollows(1) That an early opportunity should be takento announce that the Government accept and will base their administrative policy in east Africa on the general principlesenunciated in the Report which should Infuture govern British policy towards thedifferent elements which compose thepopulation of East Africa, and for whosewelfare the Imperial Government is responsible.(2) In view of the serious constitutional and practical objections to certain of the definite proposals for reorganisationcontained in the Report, it Is suggested(a) That instead of the Immediate appointmentof a High Commissioner to undertake the&quot;preparatory stage&quot; investigations, thePermanent Under Secretary of State forthe Colonies should proceed forthwith to East Africa to discuss and negotiate a scheme on the broad lines Indicated inthe Memorandum, and to report theresults of his mission to the BritishGovernment after the General Election.Inter alia the negotiations in question would&apos; have regard to the following considerations -(b) That the carrying out of the principlesof native policy should be entrusted tothe various Governors themselves underthe general control of the Secretary ofState.,     The unifying power of the HighCommissioner or Governor General couldbe adequately safeguarded without giving him arbitary powers of executiveor legislative Interference as contemplated In the Report.     special arrangements would, however, have to bemade in the case of Kenya.
(c) Common services - Defence, Customs,Transport, Posts, Telegraphs, Wireless,Aviation and General Research - should betaken out of the purview of the local governments and Legislatures and trustedentirely to the High Commissioner orGovernor General, with the assistance of a federal Council.     The common services, sofar as they are not self-supporting, wouldbe financed by an agreed percentage of thecustoms revenue, the balance being handedover to the Local Governments.(d) It has been agreed that no final action should be taken until the British Governmenthave had an opportunity of considering any points which the Government of India may wish to raise in connection with theproposed change In the Konya Constitution,and arrangements have been made for theaddition to the Governor of Kenya&apos; executive Council of a representative ofthe Governor of India for the purpose ofthe proposed discussions.In conclusion, the Secretary of State for theColonies Invited the Cabinet to authorise him to make an announcement In both Houses that the government accept the main principles of the Report, and that sir Samuel Wilson is being sent out to confer with the governors and Representatives of unofficial opinion in east Africa to see on what lines consistently withthose principles a scheme for closer union of Kenya,Uganda and Tanganyika can best be carried out, but thatno action which would finally commit the Government willbe taken until he has returned, and until there has been an opportunity for full discussion in the next Parliament.The Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum(Paper CoP. 59 (29)) by the Secretary of State for India,drawing attention to the acute Interest taken in indian the suggested constitutional changes of Kenya, andto a very important divergence between the recommendationsof the majority and the minority of the Commission inregard to the future composition of the Kenya Legislative
Council.     Lord Peel pointed out that Sir Samuel Wilson -would.-haveto indicate in the course of hie visit to East Africa which of thetwo recommendations he was authorised to put forward as the more likely to be approved by His Majesty^ Government, and that in thecircumstances while theoretically no &quot;final decision&quot; would havebeen taken at that stage, it would seem that India would be con-fronted by something very like a fait accompli.The Secretary of State for the Colonies made a statement at full length in amplification of his Memorandum.      In regard to thepoint raised in the Secretary of State for Indiars Memorandum withreference to the divergence between the recommendations of theMajority and Minority of the Committee on the subject of thefuture composition of the Kenya Legislative Council, Mr. Ameryexpressed the hope that Sir Samuel Wilson should be left consider-able latitude to negotiate for acceptance of either alternative, or,indeed, of some other course which might be suggested during had discussions in East Africa.The Secretary of State for India also made a statementdeveloping the views expressed in his Memorandum, insisting on theImportance of some guidance being given to Sir Samuel Wilson as towhich of the two recommendations in regard to the  composition of the kenya Legislative Council he should support.     Lord Peel furtherobserved that he found it very difficult to understand how the new proposals contained in Mr. Amery&apos;s Memorandum (CP.47 (29)),especially in regard   to th: direction of policy in native affairs,could be held to be consistent with the general lines of theCommissioner*s Report.     He called attention to the great interestshown by the public in regard to the question of native policy which^as the principal question dealt with by the Commission.In the course of the discussion it was suggested that theCabinet already had ample material for making up its mind, but,owingto its volume, time was required before a decision could be reached,and that the whole question had better be postponed until after theGeneral Election.     The Secretary of State for the Colonies, however,emphasized the importance of an early decision /
in view nf the great interest in the subject in EastAfrica and the extent to which public business inthe Colonies and Mandated Territory concerned washeld up pending a decision.   His object in proposingSir Samuel Wilson&apos; a visit was to enable final decisions to be takon immediately after the Election.,   Hepressed strongly that there should be no ^avoidabledelay.As the Prime Minister had a public engagementthe seme evening it was impossible to continue thediscussion at the Cabinet, and the subject was adjourned until the next Meeting.-8-
UT\rBMPLeYMENT .(previous references:Cabinet 2(29), Con-clusion 6andCabinet 50(28), Con-clusion 1.)4. The Cabinet had. under consideration thefollowing documents relative to the unemployment problem:-A Kemoranduir by the Home Secretary(Paper C.P.-27 (29)):A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (Paper C.T.-37 (29)):a Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper C.P.-53 (29)):A Note by the President of theBoard of Trade covering a Memo-randum recently submitted by himto the Prime Minister (Paper C.P.-57  (29)).The Prime Minister said that as there was not sufficient time to discuss the question that evening he thou eht it had better be remitted in the firstinstance to a Cabinet Committee.   The Cabinet agreedte this course and left it to the Prime Minister to nominate the members of the Committee.\

tfALlSTS,previous reference:cabinet 8 (29),Conclusion 6).6.The Cabinet had before them an Extract fromthe Parliamentary Debates, Houso of Commons,(Paper CP. 55 (29)) comprising the statement madeby the Prime Minister in the Houso of Commons onFriday, February 22nd, 1929, relative to the payments to be made to Irish Loyalists in consequence of therecommendations of the Wood Renton Advisory Committee.In the course of his statement (which was based on thefirst of the various proposals considered at theprevious meeting of the Cabinet), the Prime Minister,after reaffirming the ex gratia nature of the payments and repudiating any suggestion that the Governmenthad sought to compound a debt of honour, intimated that in all the circumstances,including the representations made and the feeling expressed in therecent Debate,the Government had decided to meet infull the awards which have been made or maysubsequently be made by the Wood Renton Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attentionto the demand that had been made in Parliament for thepublication of a list of persons who had received fromthe Government awards in respect of their claims.The Cabinet, in taking note of and approving the Prime Minister&apos;s statement referred to above, agreedthat the list of persons who had received awards shouldbe published after the list had been carefully scrutin-ised, and that the names should be left blank in caseswhere there might be danger to any individual from thepublication of his name, the necessary explanationsbeing given to Parliament.2, -Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,February 2 6, 1929....
