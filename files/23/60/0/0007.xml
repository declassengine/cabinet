ANGLO-american relations .Renewal ofArbitrationTreaties .BelligerentRights at Sea.(previous refer ence:Cabinet 56(28),  Con-elusion 2.)The Cabinet had before their the First Reportof the Sub-Commit tee of the Cor mittee of ImperialDefence on Belligerent Rights dealing with Arbitra-tion Treaties (Pap^r CeP.-40 (29)),  a Report which,owing to the urgency of the matter, was broughtdirect to the Cabinet without being first submittedto the Committee of Imperial Defence.   The Reportcontained agie^d recommendations for amendment ofthe Draft Treaty communicated by the AmericanGovernment in March, 1928?    the first, the omission of the words &quot;or equity&quot; in line 8 of Article l;the second, amending Article 2 (c) of the draftso as to provide in one clause for the exceptionboth of the American and so-called British MonroeDoctrines?    the third, suggesting an alteration in Article 1 of the American draft so as toprovide that the special agreement in regard toorganisation^ powers and terms of reference ofeach case referred to arbitration should besubject to the approval of the Parliament ofGreat Britain or of any Dominion whose interests are affected^ upon the analogy of the corresponding provision on the American side providing for theadvice and consent of the Senate.   The Committeewere also agreed in regretting that we cannot renew the Arbitration Treaty in the old form, excluding&quot;vital interests&quot;, and with the exception of lord cushendun, who is in favour of wide concessions bythis country on belligerent, rights, all were agreed that it. is important tc maintain these in the highest, form that is possible.   As to how this should bo done, however, the following alternative proposals were made:-
IllALTERNATIVE &quot;A&quot;.ThB proposal or the Majority (lord salisbury, Sir Austen Chamberlain,Lord Haildham, Sir Philip Cunli ffLister and Lord Cushendun) that theAmerican draft as amended should beaccepted and that Maritime belligerent-ent Rights should not be excludedfrom the Arbitration Treaty.JSL&apos;T&apos;T?RNATIVF.  &quot;p&quot; .The proposal of the Minority(Mr Pridgeman, Mr Amery and LordPeel, who based themselves on apoint of view similar to lord balfour&apos;s) that the American draftas amended should be accepted, butsubject to an intimation that Wari-time Belligerent Rights must be reserved from its operation until such time as agreement has beenreached as to what those rights are.It was stated in the Report that the first sea Lord, on behalf of the Naval Staff, demurredto the submission of Belligerent Rights to compulsory Arbitration under any condition, andthat Sir Maurice Hankey associated himself withthis view.The Cabinet also had before them Memoranda bythe Secretary of State for India (Paper C.P.-33 (29))and by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper C.P.-35 (29)) developing more fully their views assupporters of the Minority recommendation of theReport;    an expression of Lord Balfour&apos;s views(Paper 0.Po-32 ^29)) in the form of a draft private letter to Sir Robert Eorden,    in which* -      lord balfour (who,  though a member of the Sub-Co-mittee, had not been able to take part in its proceedings on the subject of Arbitration)pointed out objections    both to Compulsory Arbitra-i*:ion and to a Conferonce;    and a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Education (Paper C .P .-10 (29)) .
The discussion was taken up in succession bythe Lord Privy Seal, the Lord President of theCouncil,  the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,  the First Lord of the Admiralty,  theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the LordChancellor and the  Chancellor of the Exchequer.In thp course of his statement the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs offered for consider-ation a suggestion in connection with the proposalsof the Majority of the Sub-Committee that, in viewof the difficulty of finding a neutral Chairman forthe Arbitration Tribunal who would appreciate theBritish and American,,  as distinct from the Gontin-ental, view of the law in regard to belligerentrights,  the Chairman of the Tribunal should bealternately  (whether alternate cases for arbitrationor alternate years)  the Chief Justice of the UnitedStates of America and the Lord Chief Justice ofEngland.    At the end of the discussion, commenting on a suggestion that these highly contentious ques-tions ought not to be taken up at the very end ofthe life of a Parliament and that they ought to be deferred for a few months unless delay was toodangerous, Sir Austen Chamberlain said that,  provided the Government had a policy and could indicate with sufficient definlteness that they meant business,it. might not be impossible to persuade the AmericanGovernment to agre^ to a postponement;   he did notthink, however, that this could be done withoutinjury unless enough could be said to make it quite clear that we meant business.The discussion was eventually adjournedin order to allow other members to take part at a later Meeting,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, ,  . .February 15, 1929.-o-
