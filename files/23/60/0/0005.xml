n- THE BAM RATE. 1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that the Bank of England had decidedto increase the Bank Rate by 1 per cent, andthat the announcement was to be made the same morning .    He feared that this would have achilling effect on trade revival.The Cabinet were informed that the difficultyin keeping down the Bank Rate usually arose inthe Autumn, when money was required for payments in the United States.   At the present time,however, American prosperity was so great that money was being drawn into the United States froir.all over the world and was being used forpurposes of speculation.    As a consequence, thedifficulty in keeping down the Bank Rate had arisen at an unexpected season of the year.Some discussion took place in regard to theposition of the Government in the matter,  andthe point was emphasized that His Majesty&apos;aGovernment has no responsibility for the movementof the Bank Rate and does not control the policyof the Bank of England.
NAVAL CON- 2. The Prime Minister explained that he hadSTRUGTIONPRO GRA?  *E . summoned this emergency Meeting of the CabinetAnnouncement at the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequerregardingthe Cruiser        He recalled that on December 19, 1928, therrvrypeCabinet had decided to adhere to the programme of(Previous naval construction for the financial year 1928-29,Re f reference e&apos;.Cabinet 1 but that tenders in connection therewith should(29),  Con-clusion 8.)       not be sent out until after the first meeting ofthe Cabinet after the Recess,  and it had been understood that members of the Cabinet would beentitled to reopen the question of the construe-cion of the Cruisers at that Meeting in the eventof sore new factor affecting the situation arisingout of events in America in connection with thepassage o^ their Cruiser Bill;    but that in theabsence of some such new factor the question should not be raised.    The subject had beendiscussed at the first Meeting of the cabinet after the Recess, but the American Cruiser bill was at that time still under consideration inthe Senate and the Cabinet&apos;s discussion had been adjourned.    The American Cruiser Bill had now been passed, without any alteration in the time-limit,but the Chancellor of the Exchequer had brought tohis notice a new factor of another kind affectingthe situation, and he had acceded to Mr Churchill&apos;request that the matter should be considered bythe Cabinet.   It was essential that the cabinet should reach their decision that morning as aQuestion was being asked in the House of commons by the Member for Devonport in regard to the carrying out of the 1928-29 programme.
The Chancellor o^ the Exchequer brought tothe notice of the Cabinet that the Germans werebuilding a new 10,000-ton vessel embodying novelfeatures.    By lightening weights and developing a very high horse-power per ton they had beenable to design a very remarkable ship, particulars of which were contained in a secret memorandum prepared by General Groner, which had somehowbeen obtained and published by &quot;The Review ofReviews&quot;.    The new ship was to be armed with11-inch guns ;    it would have a greater radius ofaction than our Battle Cruisers, and would firea heavier weight of shell per minute than they.The speed would be 26 knots.   He gave otherparticulars to show that the appearance of this new class of ship would tend to discredit the older types.    Prance,  for example, was said to becontemplating a 15,000 to 16,000-ton ship inreply,  for which purpose she could employ herunused Battleship tonnage under the washington treaty.    All this indicated that Cruiser designwas passing into a phase that would renderobsolete our existing Cruisers.    No doubt theeffect on America would be to induce an attemptto incorporate in the new design lighter engines and a greater radius of action.   Mr Churchill thengave a number of particulars, taken from &quot;The Times&quot;of the speeds and radius of action of Cruisers ofvarioxis foreign Powers, which did not flatter the comparative figures for British Cruisers.   he recalled the greater speed of the German Cruisersover corresponding British vessels during the War.The important point which Mr Churchill impressed
upon the Cabinet was that  the 18 vessels thatwe now had on our hands would almost certainly be out-classed by the new American Cruisers.   Thisillustrated the mistake of building prematurely.He suggested that the two 8-inch gun 10,000-tonCruisers approved for the present year should be postponed in order that they might be introduced in later years so as to incorporate all the most-recent technical improvements.   Ey postponementwe should get the advantage not only of betterships but also we should show to the world amore pacific policy.    As it was, we were not-making the best use of the limited funds availablefor naval construction, and we were casting awaya great opportunity for easing the pressure forarmaments all over the world.   What he desired wasa sounder policy and better ships.The First Lord of the Admiralty said he had assumed that the Cabinet decision of December19th and the recent passing of the AmericanCruiser Dill, including the time-limit, would have enabled him to proceed with the 1928-29 programme without further discussion at the Cabinet.   he gave a nutter of interesting particulars regardingthe Adviralty policy in Cruiser construction,  andcorrected in certain small particulars some ofthe Chancellor of&quot; the Exchequer&apos;s figures.    Thequestion o^ the relative importance of speed and protection in the design of Cruisers had, hesaid, been under discussion for a long time atthe Admiralty, and the conclusion had beenreached that, on the whole, as the result of war experience, protection was more important thanexcessive speed.   In the new vessels about to be
laid down this principle would be embodied.    Theywould be shorter but stouter vessels.   The Germanship to whioh Mr Churchill had referred was really a small Capital Ship.   She would be well protected,though not so well as our latest designs, but would have the comparatively low speed of 26 knots.She would carry 11-inch guns, which, of course,were debarred to us under the V/ashington Treaty.T%e light machinery, giving great speed, whichItaly had adopted, involved a loss of strengthand reduced the life of a ship.    The Admiraltypreferred strength and a moderately good speed.Experiments were being carried out in Destroyerswhich, if successful, might enable plans for greater speed to be incorporated in later Cruisers.The proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,Mr Eridgeman pointed out, was in favour of slowinguown now in order to accelerate at some later time.This later acceleration, however, was not really a practicable policy.     Both at home and at theLeague of Nations we should be taken to task fora later acceleration,    ^he only successful plan was to go on steadily with a replacement programme.He recalled that the Prime Minister, in his speech at the Albert Hall on October 26, 1928,had stated that we did not intend to enter into a building competition with the United States ofAmerica.    If, however, we were to postpone our programme in order to see what kind of ships theUnited States were going to build, we should ineffeot be starting just the kind of competitionthat had been the cause of so much disquietudebefore the Far.   All the world,  including the americans, expected us to go on steadily with our
In tV course of the discussion the Cabinet were informed that persons interested in mercantileconstruction held the view that the great advancesnow being made in merchant ships were not beingtaken advantage of to  the full by the Admiralty.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that in thepast, when there had been occasion to take overships building in this country for foreign Govern-ments, their design had been found to compare unfavourably with the corresponding official types.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated, however,that the Admiralty already had under considerationto consult outside experts before completing newdesigns .After some further discussion the Cabinet agreedThat the programme already approved for the construction of two Glass &quot;A&quot;Cruisers of 10,000 tons, with 8-inch guns, to be laid down in the financialyear 1928-29,  should stand,  and thatthe Fi&apos;-st Lord of the Admiralty shouldhave authority to proceed therewith.
ANGLO-american relations .(previous reference:Cabinet 1(29),  Con-I elusion 1.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he proposed to circulate to them a private letter from Sir Esme Howardregarding Anglo-American relations, which he hadalready circulated to the Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on Maritime Eelliger-ent Rights.

KIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).TOKFIDENTIAL.;.P. h-2  (29).CABINET.THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY.PROPOSED ENQUIRY BY A ROYAL COMMISSION OR OTHER BODY.Copy of reply &quot;by the Prime Minister to the letterfrom the General Secretary to the Iron and SteelTrades Confederation.      (See CP. 20 (29)).(Circulated for purposes of record by direction of the Prime Minister, withreference to Cabinet 5  (29), Conclusion 4.).10, Downing Street,S.W.1.8th February,  1929.Dear Sir,I have received your letter of the 51st December withregard to the present position of the Iron and Steel Industry.I need hardly say that I find myself in full sympathy with manyof the opinions to which you have given expression.      The con-dition of the Iron and Steel Industry is a matter of concern tothe nation as a whole, and it is on that account that Iwelcome all the more your statement that its affairs ought to be examined rather from the economic standpoint,  than as a matterof political controversy.In your letter you ask that the Government should consider the setting up of a Royal Commission or other competentcommittee to make a full and impartial enquiry into the industry.The wisdom of setting up a Royal Commission, a slow process at best, must depend on whether such a lengthy enquiry is needed tosupply information not otherwise available or is a necessary preliminary to effective action.      In my view a course inevit-
ably involving such delay is unnecessary on either ground;and I would invite your attention to the following facts.Firstly,  the Committee on Industry and Trade, nowsitting under the Chairmanship of Sir Arthur Balfour, hasalready presented a detailed report on the iron and steelindustry and this report deals at length with some of thematters referred to in your letter;    and that Committee hasnow completed its final report, which I hope to receiveshortly.      It is obviously unnecessary that any enquiry should traverse again the ground so recently covered bythe Balfour Committee.Secondly,  the Government by the exemption from stampduty granted by the Finance Acts of 1927 and 1928 has given a practical encouragement to amalgamations in this andother industries.Thirdly, in framing the Rating Reform Scheme,  theGovernment has paid particular attention to the needs of iron and Steel, and the reliefs under that Scheme - both fromthe point of view of rates and railway freights - are designed and calculated to be of especial benefit to this particular industry.Lastly,  it is the policy oi the conservative government, if returned to power, to allow the Iron andSteel-Industry to make an application under the safeguarding of Industries procedure, and it will then have anopportunity of stating its case before an independent tribunal.      In this connection I observe that in your letterof the 51st December you express the desire that any enquiry should have special reference to the nature of thecompetition in the home market.It is plain that a Safeguarding enquiry mustnecessarily deal with this particular question and withcertain other aspects of the problem to which you refer;and it would clearly be impossible to have two committeessitting at the same time with overlapping functions.
In these circumstances,  in view of the groundcovered hy the Balfour Committee,  the far-reaching actionwhich the Government has\taken, and the opportunity which the industry will have of presenting its case underthe Safeguarding procedure, if I am again returned to office, I am bound to say that I think a long rovingenquiry is unnecessary;    and would not be helpful to theindustry.Yours truly,(Signed)    STANLEY BALDWIN.A. Pugh Esq.,The Iron andSteel Trades Confederation.
