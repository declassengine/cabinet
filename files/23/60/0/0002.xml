GEW.ANY.Reparations .Evacuation ofthe Rhine land(Pr evi ov. reference &apos;Cabinet 57(28), Con-elusion 5.)1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled the report he had made at the Meetingof the Cabinet referred to in the margin on his conversations with M. briand and Dr. Stresemannat Lugano on the subjects of German Reparationand some machinery for Verification and Concilia-tion in preparation for the evacuation of theRbineland.    Since then,  thanks largely to theefforts of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  thearrangements for an Expert Commission on german reporation had been completed.   With referenceto the proposed machinery for Verification and conciliation in regard to the occupied zone ofthe Rhineland, he himself had examined the waterways Agreement between Canada and theUnited States,  to which M. Briand had referredat the atove-mentioned conversations, and under his instructions the Legal Adviser to the Foreign-Office had drawn up a draft agreement basedthereon but applicable to the case of the Rhine-land, providing for the establishment of whatwould be described as an &quot;organ of conciliation&quot;closely linked up to the League of Nations.This term would surmount Dr. Stresemann&apos;sobjection to a &quot;Commission&quot;, which was associatedwith the Commission of Control and connotedrather the idea of an &quot;organ of liquidation&quot;,which was an inoffensive term.   The Ambassador inParis had been consulted, and agreed with him that this draft agreement ought, to meet Frenchrequirements, so far &quot;as they had been indicated.Sir Austen Chamberlain thought that the draft should also meet the views of the German Govemmen
1Following a course he had taken on the advicethe Foreign Office at the time of the locarno treaty, he proposed,  if the Cabinet saw noobjection, to forward his draft with a private letter to M. Priand.    He was quite willing, ifthe Cabinet so desired,  to show them the draft agreement and to consult them as to the terms the letter.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have full authority to forward his draft agreement to M. Briand withoutfurther reference to the Cabinetin regard to the terms either ofthe draft Agreement or of theletter.
AFGHANISTAN. 2. The Secretary of State for India drew attention once more to  telegraphic correspondence( -p-r      i       reference: respecting an application made &quot;by the AfghanCabinet 1(29)    Con- Minister in London for arms and assistance force Ixi si on 4.)King Amanullah.   He also raised the question asto whether the British Government ought not to proclaim neutrality in the Afghan civil war and suggest the desirability that other countries(Russia being indicated) should also observeneutrality.On the question of ammunition, reference wasmade to Sir Francis Humphrys&apos; suggestion thatthe reply to the Afghan Minister should be tothe effect that,  in view of the formal abdicationof King Amanullah and the surrender of his Capitalby his successor, His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to recognise the authority of the AfghanMinister in London to hold communications untilthe present obscure situation had been regularised(Sir F. Humphrys  (Kabul) Telegram No.71).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated, however, that in the view of the Foreign-Office this particular answer^ could not be sent,as the Afghan Minister^/was--wfe the personal representative cf King Amanullah.   Moreover, therequest for ammunition might be made at any moment,  to the Government of India/.    His owninclination was to say that in the present situa-tion the supply of arms to any party in Afghanistanwould be an interference in internal affairs,whatever Russia might do.    If, however, russia should supply arms in large quantities, the matter would have to be re-examined from the point of view
of the principles in the Report of the Committeeof Imperial Defence which had been approved bythe Cabinet during the previous year (see- paper cp .-26  (28) ) .In regard to the question of some declarationof neutrality, reference was made to a telegramfrom the Viceroy of India dated January 21st(N0.285.S)  sxiggesting that some warning shouldbe communicated to Russia of &quot;Hands off&quot; so faras suppling troops or war material, which srighttake the form of a declaration of neutrality and non-intervention on our part as regards civil warin Afghanistan, with a clearly-worded assumptionthat this would be the attitude of all other powers .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsrather inclined to the view that some less formalhint might be given to Russia, such as the replyto a question in Parliament.    He wished to knowwhether the Cabinet would like to leave the matter to be dealt with on the above lines by theSecretary of State &quot;^or India and himself,  orwhether they would prefer to summon the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial defence to consider the matter.    In this connection he pointed out that the circumstances in which thepresent difficulties had arisen inAfghanistandiffered somewhat from the assumptions made inthe Report of the Sub-Committee,and the principlesin that Report approved by the Cabinet would haveto be applied subject to very careful examinationof the present circumstances.
The general view of the Cabinet was in favof an Answer to a Parliamentary Question ratherthan a formal issue of a declaration of neutrality at the present stage.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, in concert withthe Secretary of State for India,should prepare,  for announcement in Parliament in answer to aQuestion, a statement to theeffect indicated above:(b) That the two Secretaries of state should have discretion to summon,if at any time they deemed neces-sary in connection with the aff-airsof Afghanistan, as a Cabinet Com-mittee the Cabinet members of theSub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence on the Defence ofIndia, who could bring to the meetings such Officials as they desired:(c) That for the present no arms shouldbe furnished to Afghanistan:(d) That the Secretary of State forIndia should invite the Govern-ment of India to develop, for theinformation of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the following passage in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram No.285.S:-&quot;Provisional policy adoptedcontingently last year will clearly need most carefuladjustment in view of entirely different set of circumstances that have now arisen&quot;.
cp.-.-.t of armsj russia.Previousleterence:Cabinet 52.&apos;28), Con-conclusion 6.)3.      The Secretary of State for Air brought tothe notice of the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency,a. request that had been made by Messrs. Vickersto carry out an order for 100 aeroplanes of a typeknown as the &quot;Vixen&quot;;, at a cost of about  500,000,for Soviet Russia.      The view of the Ministry wasthat this order,  if approved, was likely to beplaced.      In favour of granting permission was the magnitude of the order;    that 1,100 men would beemployed for one year;    that this particular machinehad not been adopted by the Royal Air Force;    thefact that by the time the order was completed the engine would be obsolescent;    that the order wouldtake a year to carry out;    and that Russia would be dependant upon British manufacture for spare parts.The arguments against permitting acceptance of theorder were that,  though not adopted by the RoyalAir Force,  the machine was of an up-to-date and efficient type;    and further that in certain respectsit was of superior performance to any machinemaintained in India where there was only a relatively small Air force and the requirement was for ageneral service machine rather than one withexceptional speed or climb,) and consequently thatthe Government of India might object.      On thewhole, Sir Samuel Hoare reported that the Air staff were inclined against the grant of a permit.The Cabinet were reminded, however,   that orders were urgently required in the aircraft in -industry and that it was difficult to keep  the firms employed and to provide for expansion in emergency.      It would be serious when it came to
be known that this order had been refused.The Cabinet were also informed that if aBritish fire were not allowed to carry out this order it would be placed in -G^^s^ny-^ff,1rt6r-(T! a ve?ygood- machine ecu Id-bo prov-i-ded . J^jvCcLJ^ .Having regard to the importance of the orderfrom the point of view of employment;    the factthat the order could no&quot;&quot;, be completed for a year;and that pending their completion delivery of the machines would be within our control;    that russia would be dependent upon us  for spare parts; and, above all, that machines littleinferior could be obtained in Germany, theCabinet agreed  (a) That the firm concerned should begiven permission to carry out theorder unless the Government ofIndia objected:(b) That the Secretary of State forIndia should inform the Govern-ment of India of the Cabinet&apos;views and should ask for theircons ent:(c) That,  if the Government approved,the Secretary of State for air should act without referring again to the Cabinet:(d) That if the Government of Indiaobjected,  the matter should again be broueht before the Cabinet .a  m
4. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that, in view of the great improvement in theEineT s health,  arrangements were being made regarding Court functions during the coming months.    The Queen had received the KingTsassent to  the Prince of Wales holding Levees onHis Majesty&apos;s behalf.    The first of these wouldbe held on Tuesday,  February 26th, at St. James&apos;Palace,  at 11-30 a.m.    The nQxt would probablybe on Friday, May 31st.    In all probability theKing would have to spend most of the summer outof London,  and the Queen would most likely hold the usual number of four Courts to  enablepresentations to be made and in order net todisappoint those sections of our trades whichare influenced by such matters.Arrangements were discussed for the attend-ance of Ministers at the first Levee.
TEVPI OYMENT .distressProposed. Useof Miners&apos;Welfare Fund.(previous reference e:Cabinet 58(28), Con-conclusion 11.)5.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePresident o^ the Board of Trade (Paper C.P.-5 (S9))ycovering a memorandum by the parliamentary secretary of the Mines Department on the questionof using the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund for the relief of distress.    In his Memorandum the parliamentary secretary of the Mines Department pointed outthat there is only about  125,000 (on GeneralFund Account) which neither is already earmarkednor belongs to any one district more than another.In these circumstances he considered it unneces-sary now to contemplate any interference with th0important work which the Welfare Fund is doingfor the industry.The Cabinet concurred in theview of the parliamentary secretary of the Mines Department,which was supported by thePresident of the Board of Trade.
*3 *50 &amp;UNEMPLOYMENDis tressedAreas .The TransfeSch arnQ an dRoad Works .(previous reference:Cabinet 50(88),  Con-clusion 1.)6.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (Paper G.P.-6 (29))stating that he was not at all satisfied with theway in which proposals were coming forward from local Authorities under the scheme announced bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer last Novemberfor the encouragement of relief works on whichtransferred labour is employed;    pointing outthat the form of relief work which most appealed to the Local Authorities was road schemes;    thatthe Cabinet had not approved a programme of road construction costing  8,00 0,000, but had decidedthat  the revised Unemployment Grants Committeescheme should include road works on non-classifiedroads towards which grants are not being made bythe Minister of Transport;    and suggesting theappointment of a Committee to recommend withoutdelay the best form of financial arrangements and other details of a plan for meeting thesituation.    Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland also suggested in his Memorandum that the committee might review the position as disclosed byreports upon the progress made with all theschemes since the beginning of November.The Minister of Labour emphasized, inter alia,the importance of Road Schemes as the quickestmethod of reconditioning unemployed Miners witha view to preparing them for such permanent employment as might offer in the district wherethey wore working on the roads or in other districts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer demurred tothe appointment of a Committee. This in effect
would reopen the  3,000,000 road constructionscheme, which had already &quot;been rejected by theCabinet.      He gave particulars of an additional expenditure for relief of unemployment amountingto an aggregate of nearly  J,000,000 spread over15 or 16 months, which he had consented to, andprotested against additional expenditure at atime when the end of the winter was approaching.He referred to a decision he had already sanc-tioned to increase, as from the 1st April next,the maintenance grants for Class I and Class II roads  increases to Go per cent, in first class, and50 per cent,  in the second -- and proposed thatthese should now be announced.      He also referredto the possibility that there would be a balance of as much as  p%000,000 in the Road Fund at the endof the current financial year, which, however, he considered it important not to allocate for thepresent.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to the limitation of the scope of theUnemployment Grants Committee scheme to non-classified roads towards which grants are notbeing made by the Minister of Transport, and itwas suggested that this limitation should be relaxed,A suggestion was made that, with a view to maintaining administrative pressure on the absorption of the unemployed workers in the mines and certain other industries in other classes oflabour, the Cabinet Standing Committee onUnemployment should be revived,  to which theMinister of Labour could refer for assistance.
The Minister of Labour said he would like to circulate a Memorandum on this subject.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should prepare, in concert with theMinister of Health and the Minister ofTransport, and make an immediate announcement in regard to the con-cession of an increase of maintenance(Classification) grants to LocalAuthorities to 60 per cent, of thecost in the case of first-class roads and 50 per cent, in second-class roads:(b) That the Minister of Labour should confer with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of transport in regard to the pobsible relaxation of the limitation of the scope of theUnemployment Grants Committee schemes to non-classified roads towards which grants are not being made by theMinister of Transport,
ITR.previous reference:Cabinet 53(26),  Con-;conclusion o.;7.    The Cabinet had before  them the following papers in relation to the expenditure on publicity for the British Industries Fair:-A Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (paper cp.-$59 (28) recalling thecircumstances in which the pro-vision by the Empire MarketingBoard of a grant of  25,000   -towards publicity for the BritishIndustries Fair had a year agobeen rejected owing to the opposi-tion of Australia, and urging thatthe Commonwealth Government shouldbe asked to withdraw their objec-tion:A Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (Paper C.P.-319 (23)) in regard to theprincipal changes that have takenplace in each of the self-govern-ing Dominions during the last fouryears affecting the Customs treat-men t of British goods:A Note by the Board of customs and Excise  (Paper CP.-41.5 (28);on the History and Results ofExisting Preferences in theBritish Tariff.The Secretary of State for Dominion-Affairs pointed out that before Christmas hehad revised the forthcoming estimates of theEmpire Marketing Board,  and reduced them by 50)000.      If the cost of publicity for theBritish Industries Fair were put on to theBoard&apos;s estimates, he would have to reinsertthis amount.      Consequently it would make no difference to the exchequer whether the moneywere found from the vote of the empire marketing Board or of the Board of Trade.

J.    The Cabinet had before them the following papers in relation to the expenditure on publicity for the British Industries Fair:-A Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (paper cp.-3p9 (28) recalling thecircumstances in which the pro-vision by the Empire MarketingBoard of a grant of  25,000  ^towards publicity for the BritishIndustries Fair had a year agobeen rejected owing to the opposi-tion of Australia, and urging thatthe Commonwealth Government shouldbe asked to withdraw their objec-tion:A Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (Paper C.P.-p19 (23)) in regard to theprincipal changes that have takenplace in each of the self-govern-ing Dominions during the last fouryears affecting the Customs treat-ment of British goods:A Note by the Board of customs and Excise (Paper G.P.-413 (28);on the History and Results ofExisting Preferences in theBritish Tariff.The Secretary of State for Dominion-Affairs pointed out that before Christmas hehad revised the forthcoming estimates of theEmpire Marketing Board, and reduced them by 50,000.      If the cost of publicity for theBritish Industries Fair were put on to theBoard&apos;s estimates, he would have to reinsertthis amount.      Consequently it would make no difference to the exchequer whexher the moneywere found from &apos;che vote of the empire marketing Board or of the Board of Trade.      Mr.Amery urged strongly that to place this itemon the estimates of the Empire Marketing board would be to alter the whole character of thescheme.      As a result of his Empire tour he
was convinced that it would produce a veryhad moral effect.      He was willing to havethe whole scheme re-examined at the next ImperialConference, when the scoje of the scheme might possibly be altered.      In the meanwhile he made a strong appeal to his colleagues not to upset the scheme, which was producing apsychological effect throughout the Dominions,for the sake of a re-distribution in estimates of such a comparatively small sum.The Prime Minister thought that theCabinet ought hot to overrule the advice ofthe Minister responsible for Dominion affairs on such a matter without a stronger reason,but hoped that at the next Imperial Conferencean opportunity would be taken to revise thescope of the scheme, perhaps in the directionproposed by the President of the Board ofTrade.      By that time, he pointed out,  theBritish Industries Pair might include Dominionsexhibits, more especially as he understoodthat there would be a Canadian exhibit at theforthcoming Pair.In view of the Prime Minister&apos;s appealthe proposal that Mr. Bruce should be asked notto press his objection to the provision of &quot;thegrant &quot;by the Empire Marketing Board was withdrawn,and the Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to find the necessary money.
8.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies(Paper C.P.-399 (28)) raising once more thequestion of unclaimed balances of pay earnedby Native members of the Military Labour Corpsduring the Bast Africa campaign, a questionwhich had been considered by the Cabinet inJuly, 1925, without any decision being reached.In this Memorandum Mr Amery urged that thepayment of the unclaimed balances should berade to the Tribes which were responsible forthe support of the dependants of its members whodied or disappeared.   He urged that there wasno justification for the Government retainingsums due to these men or their dependants, andthat it was a debt of honour which it isincumbent upon His Majesty&apos;s Government to liquidate.   He asked for the appointment of asmall Cabinet Committee.The Cabinet also had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War, dated July18th,  1925. (Paper CP.-355 (25)) urging thaton general merits the Tribes have no greaterclaim to this money than the British taxpayerfrom whose pockets it will have to come, and suggesting that if the payment was to be sanctioned it should be borne on the Colonial.Office Vote and that the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should present and defend a supplementary Estimate.
Summing up a short discussion,  thePrime Minister said that in his view lapse of&apos; ti.ie made it undesirable to raise thequestion again.The suggestion regarding theappointment of a CabinetCommittee was not approved.
LORD CECIL&apos;SROAD VEHICLESREGULATIONBILL,  192 8.(Fr eviou a reference:Cabinet 4(28), Con-cliision 5(d) .)9.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (Paper CP.-9 (29))suggesting that when the Committee Stage ofViscount Cecil of Chelwood&apos;s Road VehiclesRegulation Bill, 1928, is taken in the House ofLords on the 22nd January the Government repre-sentative should be in a position to make astatement to the effect that if the Governmentis returned to power after the General Election-there will be no avoidable delay in the promotion of legislation dealing with road traffic once the Royal Commission1s Report has been received.The Cabinet were informed that figures given by Lord Cecil in regard to the statistics of fatal accidents on the roads had stronglymoved Members of the House of Lords.      TheGovernment spokesmen had not thought it right, however,  to refer the Bill to a select Committee at a time when the RoyalCommission on Roads was actually sitting, andthe House of Lords had recognised this pointof view.      It had been hoped that when thequestion came up again the Government wouldhave been in a position to announce that theRoyal Commission would be able to produce an interim report on Lord Cecil&apos;s Bill in timefor action in the present Session, butapparently it could not be ready until July.The Cabinet agreed -That the Government spokesmen inthe House of Lords should have authority to announce that when. the report of the Royal commission was received it was the intentionof the Government to legislate onthe subject, but that if the House
ox Lords were insistent theyshould have discretion toagree to the question beingreferred to a Select Committee.
BETTING 10.    The Cabinet had before them aGAMING ANDLOTTERIES. memorandum by the Home Secretary,  (PaperNo.  CP.  7 (29)),  on the subject of Betting,(previous reference: Gaming and Lotteries,  in which, afterCabinet 59,(28), Con- discussing many aspects of the question, itelusion if) .was pointed out that during the Secretaryof State&apos;s tenure of office there had been no interference with any real amusement of thepeople, nor had there been any attempt to institute a new and puritan regime.      Thiswas being gradually realised.      Moreover the judges in general urge stricter&apos; and not laxerenforcement of the law.      For this reason the Home Secretary did not at the momentfavour the setting up of an enquiry whichmust necessarily involve much time and labourand therefore expense.The Cabinet agreed generally with theviews of the Home Secretary, and authorised him to make a statementexplaining that prosecutions in individual cases were not undertaken by his directions but that in generalthe law was not put into force for thepurpose of suppressing practices whichwere only technically illegal andinvolved no real mischief;    further that there was no necessity for an enquiry.
ESTIMATES OP 11.     The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumTF E PI OFT IMC-SERVICFS. by the Secretary of State for Air (Paper C.P.-4-Air Estimates       (29)), prepared in compliance with a requestand the Courseof Air Expend!- made by the Cabinet at their last Meeting beforeture in thisChristmas,  on the subject of Air ExpenditureCountry andAbroad.(previous reference reference e:Cabinet 58f28),  Con-clusion 2.)ALSO(previous reference:Cabinet 57(28), Con-clusion 6) .in Great Britain,  the United States, France andItaly, together with remarks on certain other aspects o^ the difficult problem of Air expendi-ture .The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to those portions of the memorandum which indicated a possibility that it might benecessary before long to increase the airestimates.      If this were done, Mr. Churchillpointed out,  there would be an end to anypeace policy.The Cabinet recognised that the factsset forth in the memorandum were of greatimportance and value, and expressed the fullestsympathy with a proposal of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that when the GenevaPreparatory Commission on Reduction and limitation of Armaments meets, no opportunity should be lost for urging a reduction in air e^feisa^es.
