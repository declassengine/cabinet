government policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(39), Con-elusion 5.)1. In aeeordance with an undertaking made atthe previous Meeting of the Cabinet, the PrimeMinister gave an outline of the principal headsof Government Policy to which he intended torefer in his speech to be delivered on thefollowing day in London.    These included HOUSING,SLUM CLEARANCE, EDUCATION, MATERNITY, child welfare,  FACTORIES LEGISLATION,  NURSERY SCHOOLS,EMPIRE DEVELOPMENT and certain details affectingAGRICULTURE in addition to the rating relief,which latter also provided the principal item ofGovernment Policy for RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.His aim would be to strike a strong note as towhat the Government had already accomplished, what it was working for, and its ideals, with thegeneral lines of the programme to be adopted inthe next few years.   He proposed to avoid details and promises as to the rate at which the policy would be carried out,    On one or two heads,  suchas Colonial Development, he might be a littlemore specific, but the execution of other items of the Government&apos;s policy would depend upon theamount of money available in each year, whichcould not be foreseen.   In view of the general lines on which he intended to speak, the PrimeMinister deprecated discussion of the variQusdetailed proposals that had been circulated to-the Cabinet. &apos;The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesaccepted the Prime Minister&apos;s decision so far as agriculture was concerned, but asked that in due course his Memorandum on Agricultural Policy(Paper C .P.-11S. (29)) should be considered bythe Cabinet.

He gathered that the Attorney-General had been badly reported and that the language he had used had beenguarded.      In any case the facts of the situation had been made clear in a recent speech by theMinister of Health.      The Prime Minister did notthink it would be necessary for him to refer tothe matter in his speech on Government Policy onthe following day, but even if he should on any occasion find it necessary to mention it he would avoid giving any pledge and make clear that itwould require a good deal of investigation.The Minister of Health said that the proposed extension would involve an ultimate capital liabilityon the Exchequer which might as a maximum amountto  134,000,000 for men only;    he could not give any figures for women.The First Commissioner of Works suggested tothe Prime Minister that he should emphasise theimportance of passing a Road Bill, which had become a matter of considerable public interest inconsequence of recent accidents.
the EMPIREMARKETINGBOARD.ProposedBritishMarketingBoard.(previous reference *Cabinet 9(28)    Con-clusion 9.)The Secretary of State for the Colonies,referring to his Memorandum entitled &quot;An employment policy for the Election&quot; (Paper CP.-87 (29),page 4), asked if the Prime Minister intended torefer to his proposals for the promotion of the marketing of British manufactures at home and overseas .The Prime Minister replied that he intended torefer in general terms to the importance of themultiplying of markets both at home and in theDominions and Colonies, but wished to avoid giving any details.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should announce the general policy ofthe Government on the lines indicated above.
3bts.he Policy of health  BalfourJote.previous reference:Cabinet 50(28), Con-elusion 5.)2. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn toa speech on the subject of the Budgefi, made inthe Rouse of Commons on the previous day byMr Philip Snowden, in the course of which he stated that the Labour Party had never subscribedto the principle of the Balfour Mote and haddenounced it as &quot;an infamous Note&quot;, and had stated that they would hold themselves &quot;open, if&quot;the circumstances arose, to repudiate the&quot;conditions of that Note&quot;.The Cabinet discussed the general lines of the remarks to be made in the House of Commons thesame afternoon on behalf of the Government by theSecretary of State for ar. Their general view was subsequently drafted out by. the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and read to the Cabinet towards theend of the Meeting.The Cabinet agreed  That their views should be commu-communicated by the Chancellor of theExchequer to the Secretary ofState for War (who by that time had left the Cabinet in order toprepare his speech) in the follow-ing t erms:-We were all greatly surprised and startledyesterday by the statement of the Right Hon.Gentleman that he and his Party would ifreturned to power hold themselves free to repudiate the fundamental principle of the balfour Note, namely, that Great britain should take no more from Europe by way ofdebts and reparations than she requires topay her own obligations to the United States.This principle has been for seven years the foundation of the treatment of European debtproblems by every Government which has heldoffice here.    It has come to be generally recognised throughout Europe as a jusi$ andunchallengeable principle.    It has beenembodied in formal articles in both agree-ments made for debt settlements with Italyand with Prance.    The settlement with Italy has been actually ratified:    the settlement with Prance has not been ratified but Prancehas paid punctually^ and we have every reasonto believe will continue to pay,  the importantsums agreed upon between the two countries.The principle of the Balfour Note is the
foundation of our policy towards the expert Inquiry now proceeding in Paris.Great hopes have been attached to thisExpert Commission, not only purely inthe regions of finance but as a further contribution to the appeasement of europe and to the liberation of Germany from foreign occupation and financial control.It is a wanton and a reckless act in no way called for by anything that hasoccurred for the Right Hon. Gentlemanand his Party now to threaten to repudi-ate the principle upon which every forwardstep towards European reconstruction and peace has been taken.    If such a declara-tion were persisted in and Europe is ledto believe that British policy in the futtr emay aim at obtaining larger payments from europe on account of debts and reparationsthan are required from her by the UnitedStates, the utmost injury will be done notonly to British interests but to the widerinterests of world peace.The Leader of the Opposition is I believespeaking later this evening in this debate and I ask him formally whether he acceptsand endorses the declaration of the right on.Fember for Colne Valley and if thisconstitutes the official policy of theLabour Party,
Irpdugtion AND 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsVrlTATION OFWrtrrjyE&amp;TS. informed the Cabinet that the information Communication-l^g^o-Ameriean       cated by the United States Embassy to the effectRelations .that V\T Castle, of the State Department, wouldl(Previous accorpany the American Delegation to the meetingI Reference:I Cabinet 16 of the Preparatory Commission at Geneva had provedI (29), Con-1 elusion 1.) to be incorrect.    The latest intelligence, however,as set forth in Geneva Telegram No. 22, of April16th, was rather reassuring.   This was to theeffect that the American Admiral  Hilary Joneshad informed Admiral Kelly that a proposal by usbased on the present naval position would probablylead to success, that is to say:-   Existing tonnagenot to be exceeded:    agreement up to 1936 expiringwith the Washington Convention;    United States?:to build no more Cruisers as they had no Cruiserreplacement due before 1940:   United States would consider favourably a moderate replacement programme for Great Britain as they realise that the majorityof our Cruisers pass the age limit at the same time;the present arranged superiority in 8-inch Cruisers23 to 20 is a very important point to them leadingprobably to concessions elsewhere;    if an agreement could be reached on these lines, which are really the published programme of the two countries,this might serve as an international basis;-&quot;the Americans would agree to the modified french proposal in categories 10,000 to 1,850 tons, nextbelow 1850 tons, next submarines, which wouldprobably be acceptable to us if other points agreed with by America&quot;.
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that theabove proposals required further examination indetail, tut at first sight appeared to theAdmiralty tol.-be hopeful.    Should they prove acceptable he hoped that the greatest care wouldbe taken to carry Japan with iis .In the course of the discussion the possibilityof a settlement of the Naval question on soundlines was generally welcomed, but the need forcaution was mentioned.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the First Lord of theAdmiralty undertook to examine thequestion in the first instance, andthe former indicated that this mightnecessitate his asking for the resumption of the adjourned discus-sion by the Cabinet on Anglo-Americandelations.
MlPROPOSED--A AD-HAIFAm ANDINS.previous conference:- -t 125), Con-conclusion 5).if,    The Secretary of State for Poreign. affairs reminded the Cabinet of the decision they hadtaken at the meeting on the 20th March to theeffect that he should instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Paris to take up the question ofthe 3agh.dadr.llaifa Railway with M. Berthelotof the French Foreign Office.      In accordance with theCabinet decision,  a despatch with the relevantdocuments had been sent to Sir William Tyrrell.Sir Austen Chamberlain himself had accompanied the despatch with a private letter, and had seenSir William Tyrrell on his way through Paris.Since then, however, an official of the ForeignOffice had discovered the existence of anadditional document from whichit appeared that the Iraqi cabinet had been willing to grant an extension to theTurkish Petroleum Company on certain conditions,which included the eventual construction of a railway to the Mediterranean, without specifyingthe port of Haifa.      It was only in consequenceof representations by Sir Henry Dobbs thatHaifa had been included.      This appeared at first sight    to invalidate the case which had been sentto Sir William Tyrrell.Sir Austen Chamberlain said that he was taking the matter up with the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, but in the meanwhile he had felt bound to inform the Cabinet that that,and that alone, was the reason why he had notbeen able to carry out the Cabinet decisionreferred to in the margin.-8-
The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that his attention had only just been called to the matter, and he had not had time to make full investigations, either asto the precise significance of the documentreferred to by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, or- as to why it had not been included in the series sent to Sir WilliamTyrrell.      He was far from being assured thatthe document in question invalidated the Britishcase, and asked that judgment might be reserved until he and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had had time to go into the matter.
OHEMICALPOLICY.(previous reference:Cabinet IS(29), Con-I elusion 5.)5.    In pursuance of the Conclusion referred toin the margin,  the Cabinet had under furtherconsideration the proposal contained in a Memo-randum (Paper CP.-Sijf (29))  by the Secretary ofState for Air for the ratification of the protocol for the Prohibition of the Use ofPoisonous Gases, subject to the same reservationswith which other Powers, including Prance and russia,.accompanied their ratifications, viz.:-&quot;(i) The Government is only bound by the protocol vis-a-vis those other states which have signed and ratified the protocol or adhered thereto;(ii)  The Government ceases to be bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis any enemyState whose armed forces or whoseallies do not respect the Protocol&quot;.After a short discussion,  the cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for Air&apos;proposal should be referred in thefirst instance to the Committee ofImperial Defence for consideration at their meeting on April pOth:(b) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should inform the dominions of the nature of this proposal,and thatit was to be considered by the Committeeof Imperial Defence&apos;  and should invitethe Governments concerned to communicatetheir views either to their repiresen-tatives at the meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence or direct toHis Liajestyrs Government.
6.   The Cabinet had before their a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (paper c.P.-103 (29)) covering recent telegrams which have passed between the Secretary of State and the present-ish Commissioner for Iraq regarding the politicalsituation in Iraq.    The Memorandum recalled that,at their Meeting refer ed to in the margin, theCabinet had approved the proposed new Treaty with iraq but had agreed that the ratification of theTreaty should be held over until the revision ofthe Military and Financial Agreements of 1924 hadbeen completed.    The negotiations  for the revisionof the Agreements had broken down,  the IraqMinistry had resigned in December, 1928,  and itappeared most improbable that any Ministry could be formed which would accept the British terms.In view of the serious consequences of failure to reach some solution, negotiations have takenplace between Sir Gilbert Clayton and King Feisalwhich have resulted in a modus vivendi under which--it was hoped that an Iraq Ministry might agree to function.    The proposals included (l) the abandon-ment of the Draft Treaty of 1927 and the proposed new Military and Financial Agreements, and in their place an extension of the currency of the agreements of 1924:    and (2)  the giving by His Majesty&quot;sGovernment of certain assurances of which the mostimportant    elated to the entry of Iraq into theLeague of Nations in 19 32.After consultation with allthe interested departments the Secretary of State forthe colonies had, by Telegram No. 108 of the 25th March,  1929,authorised Sir Gilbert Clayton to notify King Feisal
that,  subject to certain qualifications set outin that telegram, a settlement on the proposedbasis wouldbbe acceptable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  and he invited the Cabinet to approve the action taken by him in the matter.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that he hinself and, he thought,other Members of the Cabinet, had consentedsomewhat reluctantly to article 8 of the1927 Treaty, which contained an undertaking by His Majesty&apos;s Government to support thecandidature of Iraq for admission to theLeague of nations in 19.52.      As stated inparagraph 8 in the memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, the Foreign office had been consulted before assent had beenfollowinggiven to the/passage in the Secretary ofState&apos;s telegram of 25th March:-&quot;That His Majesty&apos;s Government are,however, prepared to inform theLeague Council at earliest opportunity when notifying that body that it is not proposed toproceed with 1927 Treaty,  that itis His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;intention, unless in the meantimeany serious check in the political or economic progress of the country has occurred,   to recommend to theCouncil at their June session in1932, by which time various importantintermial and external questions whichare still under settlement shouldhave been disposed of,  that Iraqshould be admitted to membership ofthe League forthwith.&quot;Sir Austen Chamber-lain had minuted this inthe Foreign Office to the effect that all future papers on the subject should be referredto him personally, and he thought that thismatter was of such importance that any futurechanges of policy should be brought by theMinisters concerned before the Cabinet.-12-
Subject to this,  the cabinet approved the action taken by theSecretary of State for the Colonias set forth in the memorandum cp. 103 (29).
EMPLOYMENT(prsviousReference&apos;Cabinet 13(29), Con-elusion 8.)7.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister of Labour (Paper CP.-113 (29)) proposing that a small Committee of the Cabinet should beappointed at once to prepare, on the basis of thematerial contained in the Report of the Inter-Department 1 Corrmittee on Unemployment (paper c.P.-104 (29)), a Memorandum for approval bythe Cabinet and subsequent publication as a white paper, containing a reply to the proposals madein Wx Lloyd George&apos;s pamphlet &quot;We can conquerunemployment&quot;.After some discussion,  the Cabinet agreed  That any use of the materialcontained in the Report ofthe Inter-Departmental Committeeon Unemployment for politicalpurposes must be made on theresponsibility of the minister concerned, who of course in any event would not refer publiclyto the document in question.
Hjjt^s 3.      The Home Secretary, who at one time hadrjjj, hoped that the Cabinet might be willing to sanction his making arrangements with theprevious-reference: Government V/hips to proceed with the AliensCabinet 13(27), Con- Restriction Bill, which had been droppedelusion 12)for lack of time in the 1927 Session,  statedthat in present circumstances he would not press his proposal.
co!btttee on industry andirade .Ehe Balf ourcommitteereport.(previous reference:cabinet h-0(24) gon-clusion 7) ,9.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Eoard of Trade (paper cp.-101 (29)) relative to the Final Report ofthe Balfour Committee on Trade and Industry (Cmd.3282).   The Memorandum expressed the view thatthe Government should decide without delay which of the Co:vmittee&apos;s recommendations they areprepared to adopt so far as these recommendationscall for action by the Government.Attached to the Memorandum in Lists A and Bare the various recommendations which concern theBoard of Trade, together with a note in each caseof what is or should, in the Presidents opinion,be the Government&apos;s attitude.

An Appendix contains a summary of theCommittee&apos;s principal findings and recommendationscalling for Government action,  or having a bearing on Government policy, which primarily affect otherDepartments than the Board of Trade.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That unless he should receiveobjections from any of his colleagues,the President of the Board ofTrade should have authority to makeannouncements on the lines proposedin his memorandum (CP,  101  (29)).(b) That Ministers who might have any objections to make should communicate them to the President-  of the Board of Trade before theend of the present week.
MINING SUB- 10. With, reference to the Conclusion noted inSIDENCE.the margin, the Cabinet had before them a Memoran-(previous reference: dum by the President of the Board of Trade (PaperCabinet 57(27), Con- CP.-81 (29)) covering the Report of the Inter-elusion 3.)Departmental Committee on the recommendations ofthe Royal Commission on Mining Subsidence and aNote thereon by the Secretary for Mines.In his Memorandum the President of the Board ofTrade, after stating his reasons for rejecting the Royal Corrmission&apos;s recommendations relative tothe endorsement of conveyances  (No .5)and therelief for &quot;small&quot; property owners (No.9), intimatalthat in his view action on the Report should be postponed until suitable opportunity arises andshould then be limited as follows:-(i)  To publish the Mining Association&apos;undertaking to give information aboutcolliery workings.(ii) Subject to the views of the Secretaryfor Scotland, to introduce legislation to deal with the decision in Buchananand Andrew.(iii) To introduce legislation to enable&quot;small&quot; property owners to enforceclaims  arising out of subsidence inthe County Court.(iv) To extend Section 157 of the PublicHealth Act, 1875, in order to provide further supervision over building in mining areas .The President concluded by inviting the Cabinet to approve his proposals on the understanding thatthe decisions would not be published until theGovernment were pressed for their considered views.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals ofthe President of the Board ofTrade,  on the -understandingthat he would, as far as possibldiscour-age the raisin- of anycuestions on this subject:(b) That the Secretary of State forScotland should cormrunicate anyobservations he night wish torake to the President of theBoard of Trade in regard toiteir (ii) above as soon aspossible.

sb&apos;1LLP0X.reportedprecautionsby the frenchgovernment.12.    The attention of the Cabinet was invitedto reports in the newspapers that the FrenchGovernment had issued regulations requiring thatno person should enter France from Great Britainunless vaccinated within the previous two months.The Minister of Health received informationduring the Meeting to the effect that these regula-tions had been issued by the local officers atDunkirk without authority from the central Govern-tr-ent, but the French Cabinet was to meet at noonto consider the question.    Assurances had beentelegraphed to the French Government in regard tothe serious eases of smallpox among persons landedfrom the S.S. TUSCANIA,  and the Ambassador was not without hope that the French Government mightcancel the regulations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsalso gave the Cabinet information in the main tothe same effect, though indicating that the regula-tions were to apply to all Channel ports.The Minister of Health made a statement to theCabinet regarding the incidence of smallpox in thiscountry during the present year, including particu-lars of the cases among persons landed from theS.S. TUSCANIA,  together with details of the precautions taken by the Health Authorities, whichhad greatly reduced the risk of spread of infection.Mr Neville Chamberlain said that inthe course ofthe present yerr there had been 3,896 cases ofmild srallpox in this country.
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that at the present stage the only answerhe could give to Cuesx,ions in Parliament wasthat the French Cabinet were meeting to considerthe question and that the British Governmentwere in com: \mication with ther on the subject.Q,, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 17,  1929.
