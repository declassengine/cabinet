MALTA. 1. The-Secretary-^-State -for -Foreign. Affairs.Controversies        mentioned to the Cabinet controversies that had with the vatican. arisen with the Vatican in regard to certain matters in Ifelta,    The first difficulty had arisen in connection with a request from the Vatican thatHis Majesty *s Government should facilitate the departure of a Franciscan friar who had got intotrouble with his Order.   In this case the Vaticanhad been informed that the Government  of Malta wasplacing no obstacle in the way of the friar&apos;departure but it was not for it to enforceecclesiastical discipline.   The second difficulty-resulted from a despatch recently received fromthe British Mission at the Vatican enclosing anote-verbal from Cardinal Gaspari protesting against the attitude alleged to have been adoptedby the Government of Malta towards three AnglicanBishops who recently visited the Island.    Accordingto these allegations the Bishops had held a courseof propaganda missions in the Throne Room of the palace at Valetta,  and  the meeting of the MaltaParliament had been suspended by the Prime minister^ Malta in order that he might be present.    This,it was stated in the note-verbal, was offensive toRoman Catholics in Malta, and particularlydispleasing because of the former connection of the palace with the Catholic Order of the Knights of malta, and whilst an appeal was made to thetradition of the British Empire in favour ofmaintaining the religions of the various colonies to discountenance the action of the Malta Govern-ment, it was suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-roent should censure the use made of the Palaceand the action of the Prime Minister.-1-
&quot;hile the Cabinet were informed by the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies that the visit of the threeAnglican Bishops had been arranged by the Bishopof Southern Europe mainly for the purpose ofvisiting the Fleet and Garrison in Malta, and thatthere was no truth in the allegations ofproselytism,  and so forth, they concurred inthe action taken by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in instructing the british minister at the Vatican to inform the CardinalSecretary of State that we were not prepared todiscuss such matters with the Vatican and thathe was taking this courteous step rather thanthe alternatives of ignoring the note-verbalor returning it.
2.   The chancellor ellor of the Exchequer reportedto the Cabinet that while passing through Parishe had learned that the deliberations of the expert Commission on Reparations were proceedingcomparatively favourably and were not unlikely to lead to some acceptable agreement.In the course of a short discussion on thesubject the President of the Board of Trade laidsome stress on the risks of any extension of thesystem of payment of reparation in kind by Germany.The acceptance of reparation in kind by certain countries for use within their own borders hadalready proved very adverse to British trade, moreespecially by conferring on German exporters a kind of goodwill.   Any extension of the system by the establishment (as suggested in the Press)of a bank or agency with the object of stimulating the acceptance of German goods in connection withthe reparations settlement was greatly to bedeprecated.
THE BUDGET. 3. The Cabinet welcomed the proposal by theChancellor of the Exchequer that the forthcoming(previous reference: Budget should be discussed at a Meeting of theCabinet 11(29),  Con- Cabinet on Wednesday, April 10th.elusion 14.)-4-
THE INTERNATIONALLABOUR ORGANISA-TION AND THEWASHINGTON hours convention.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(29) , Con-elusion 5.)4.With reference to the discussion of thequestion of the revision of the Washington hours convention referred to in the margin, the Ministerof Labour gave the Cabinet an account of theproceedings of the recent session of the Govern-ing Body of the International Labour Office.Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland recalled that theCabinet had practically agreed that the WashingtonConvention in   its present form was unworkable.The Law Officers had advised that certain Britishlaws were inconsistent with it,  and it had beenfound that some parts of the Convention were soloosely worded as to enable it to be evaded withease.   The policy of the Cabinet, therefore, hadbeen to obtain a revised Convention.   after explaining the attitude of the various countries represented at the Geneva Conference, the Ministerof Labour stated that he had found it advisable togive up for the moment the idea of a resolution infavour of a revision of the Convention since hecould not carry this at that session, and he had accordingly substituted a resolution to the effectthat the proposal should be taken into favourable consideration and that a Report should be prepared on the subject for the May meeting of the Councilof the Organisation.    The representatives of theemployers had abstained from voting on this resolu-tion, and those       the workers had voted against it, but the representatives of 8 out of the 10Governments had voted in favour of it.    The absten-sion of the French representative, who a few minutes be^or0 had undertaken to support theresolution subject to certain amendments (whichhad been made to meet his wishes), had prevented
the adoption of the resolution.    The result,therefore, was that the situation was at presentcompletely open;    there had been no vote either for or against a revision of the Convention.The Minister of Labour advised that future action by His Majesty&apos;s Government should depend on howpublic opinion developed as a result of the discussions likely to take place between workers and employers, which should be carefully watched.The Cabinet accepted this view.
gg PROPOSED$ED AD-HAIFA&apos; [LV/AY ANDIPELIN3-previous reference:Cabinet 11(29), Con-elusion 3.)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of thequestion of the proposed Baghdad-Halfa railway and Pipeline, and in addition to the documentsbefore them at their previous Meeting had underconsideration a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper CP.-80 (29)) cover-ing an historical Note prepared by the ColonialOffice dealing with the points on which the cabinet had asked for further information;    also a map ofthe region affected.The historical Note summarised the communica-tions which had passe a between the Iraq Governmentand the Turkish Petroleum Company since November.1927, and the reasons for the view that therewould be no breach of international obligation(either under Article 11 of the Anglo-Iraq Treatyof 1922 or under Articles 10 and 11 of the SanRemo Agreement) if the Iraq Government were to insist on the Haifa route as a condition for thegrant to the Company of an extension of the period within which plots must be selected for development.In his covering Memorandum the Secretary ofState for the Colonies stated that he had been advised that it would be very doubtful whetherGreat Britain would be legally justified inputting pressure upon the Iraq Government to impose the Haifa route condition.    Fortunately, however,such intervention was unnecessary, as the IraqGovernment had strong reasons of their own forobjecting to a Syrian alignment of rail and pipelines and to a Syrian terminal.    Neither theBritish Government nor the late High Commissionerfor Iraq had ever intervened to put pressure on
the Iraq Government to cause them to insist onthe rTaifa terminal as a condition of the srantof an extension of time to the Company.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary o^ State forForeign Affairs should furnish HisMajesty*s Ambassador in Paris withall the relevant documents andshould instruct him to take up thequestion at issue with M. PhilippeBerthelot, of the French ForeignOffice, on the following lines:-(i) A. complete disclosure of theevidence to pro-^e that theFrench Government is labouringunder a misunderstanding inits belief that political pressure has been put byPis Majesty&apos;s Government onthe Governrent of Iraq to insist on the Faifa alignmentfor the pipeline and railwayas one of the conditions ofan extension of the periodof time allowed to the TurkishPetroleum Company for the selection of plots for develop-ment,  and that this conditionwas imposed spontaneously bythe Iraq Government:(ii) To make clear to M. Berthelotthat the Turkish Petroleum Com-pany is perfectly free to maintainor withdraw the letter sent onbehalf o^ the Company byMr. Skliros  (the Company*sagent in Baghdad)  to the Iraq\ Government on the 9th November,1928:I (iii) To state that His Majesty&apos;s/ Government will not put any/ pressTire on the Government of/ Iraq either to maintain or with-draW the condition to whichobjection is made, by the FrenchGo^rnment .   Sir &quot;illiam Tyrrell,however, should make it cloarthat Pis Majesty&apos;s Government doesnot conceal its desire for theadoption of Haifa as the terminusof a pipeline and railway, just as the French Government is knownto prefer a Syrian port, andthat they reserve
their full right to promote it by such means as the completeor partial construction, aguarantee of interest or a subsidy of a railway and similar methods:(iv) That, if the French Governmentare willing to accept this basis,Sir &quot;&quot;illiam Tyrrell should be at liberty to suggest that Middle-East questions outstanding betweenthe two co\mtries should be taken up en bloc and to ask the FrenchGovernment to submit their pro-posals.   The question of the stage in the negotiations at which this last proposal should be made should be left to the discretion of the Ambassador:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, before forwarding his despatch to His majesty Ambassador, should show it to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies .
BRITISH RADIUM 6. The Cabinet had under further considerationREQUIREMENTS.the report of the Radium Sub-Committee of the(Previous Committee of Civil Research (Paper CP.-70 (29))Ref erence  :Cabinet 11 which had been appointed to examine the radium(29), Con-clusion 9.) requirements of Great Britain, and also had beforethem a Memorandum (Paper CP.-82 (29)) circulatedby the Minister of Health in pursuance of theCabinet^ request at their previous Meeting.In his Memorandum the Minister of Healthexpressed the following views with regard to themore important issues raised in the Sub-Committee1 sReport(a) As regards the provision of funds forthe proposed purchase of the 20 grammesof radium required, the most satfs-factory arrangement would be a publicappeal (by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper orother persons interested) combined with a State subsidy on a 50 per cent,basis.    Mr Chamberlain did not think,however, that it would be immediatelynecessary to purchase more than 10grammes, obtaining the other 10 withina period of a year or more.(b) As regards the question of the organ-isation required to secure the best use of any additional stocks of radiumpurchased, the proposals for theappointment of a body of Trusteesand of a Radium Commission with executive functions were, in theopinion of the Minister of Health,well-designed for the purpose in view.(c) As regards the question of publication,Mr Neville Chamberlain thought that publication of the Report was notonly expedient but desirable:    first,because the Report contains a greatdeal o: information not otherwiseobtainable;    secondly, because itindicates the needs of the situationboth as regards the stock of radiumand the safeguards under which itshould be used;   and, thirdly, because it suggests a method of organisation which has the advantage of includingpublic and expert opinion and judgement in adLdnistration.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed to providethe  100,000 estimated as the cost of carrying outthe proposal of the Minister of Health.The President of the Board of Trade reportedthat radium was subject to a Duty, which Duty,however, had been suspended until next June.If radium was to be purchased the suspension ofthe Duty ought to be continued .   He drew attentionto the statement in paragraph 41 of the Sub-Committee Ts Report expressing doubt as to whether any of the Cornish ores are sufficiently abundantto enable them to compete with ores from theBelgian Congo, which would be liable to criticism.The Cabinet felt, however, that such criticismneed not be taken very seriously.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of theMinister of Health as summarised above, including the immediatepublication of the Report:(b) That the Minister of Health should arrange for a Private Notice question to be addressed to the Prime Ministerand answered by him before the easter recess, announcing the Government&apos;policy:(c ) Tha-1&quot; the suspension of the Duty onradium should be continued afterJune,  1929.
THE ARMY&quot; AND 7.   The Cabinet had: befbr-e-them a Memorandum&apos;   &quot;&apos;AIR FORCE(ANNUAL) BILL. -   by the Secretary of State for War (Paper C.P.-83 ( 29)) covering the Army and Air Force (Annual^(previous reference: Bill,  the notes on the clauses of which explainCabinet 16(28),  Con- the scope of the only amendments which the Billelusion 12.)introduces into the Army and Air Force (Annual)Act.   The measure must receive the Royal Assentbefore the 30th April,  19 29,  and it is proposed tnatall its stages in the House of Commons should betaken before the Easter Recess .The Cabinet approved the actionof the Prime Minister in author-ising the introduction of the Bill.
pgTROL PRICES(previous reference:Cabinet 10(29), Con-clusion 8.)3. With reference to their discussion on thequestion of the recent rise in Petrol Pricesreferred to in the margin, the Cabinet had underconsideration a Note by the President of the Boardof Trade (Paper CP.-86 (29)) circulating as amatter of urgency the statement on Petrol andKerosene Prices by the three Oil Companies towhom the Government request for information hadbeen addressed.    The statement in question, afterreferring to the dumping of Russian petrol duringthe last two years, which had resulted in the selling of petrol in Great Britain at prices farbelow the level of world values, and to thesettlement  of the price war at the end of February,1929, set out the arguments and the statistical andother data which the Companies claimed establishedtheir contention that the British consumer has beenin no way unjustly affected.   The Companies claimed that as part of their normal procedure they do their best to foresee the trend of world prices and to make advance arrangements to secure amplesupplies,and at reasonable stable prices whichwill be influenced only to an equitable degree by changes in world prices .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The President of the Board of Trade,The Lord Chancellor,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Rome Secretary,The Secretary of State for War -should meot to examine the reportby the Oil Companies and to prepare the material for a statement to bemade by the Prime Minister in theHouse of Commons before the Easter vRecess:
(b) That a Question to be put byLieutCommander Eenworthy inthe House of Commons on thefollowing day should be replied to by the President of the Boardof Trade as follows:-&quot;The statement of the Oil Companiesis under consideration,    As regardsthe last part of the Question I havealready stated that the government consider that undertakings dominat-ing the supply and distributionof articles of common use have a duty to supply on reasonable terms and to satisfy the public thattheir terms are reasonable, andthese considerations will of course be equally applicable to future aswell as to present circumstances.But, subject to what I have said,it is not the intention of theGovernment to attempt to interferewith the future commercial policyof the Oil Companies&quot;:(c) That at the appropriate moment theGovernment should communicate toParliament, in a White Paper, ahitherto unpublished letter, drawnup at the time when the Governmentfirst bought the shares in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, signed bySir John Bradbury and sent on theauthority of Mr Lloyd George (whowas  then Chancellor of the Exchequer)to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 20, 1929.
