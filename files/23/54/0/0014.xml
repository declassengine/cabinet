RUSSIA.policy towards(Previous In regard to the probable criticism that reference&apos;Catinet 13        the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; ought(07)   Con-elusion 1.)       to have taken rp with the Soviet Government eachbreach of  the Trade Agreement as it occurred,  itwas generally agreed that the reply should be tothe effect that it was useless to take up parti-cular breaches of the Agreement when the wholepolicy and attitude of the Soviet Government wasthroughout a contravention of the Agreement: inother words, it was useless to apply a procedure which was based on the assumption that both parties in their general policy would observe the trade agreement in good faith. .In regard to a view, likely to be raised inthe House of Lords,  that the best plan would beto interrupt the Trade Agreement but not to break off diplomatic relations, there was general agree-ment that such action was likely to prove,  if anything, rather more embarrassing to ourselvesthan to Soviet Russia.The Cabinet further agreed that the Secretaryof State should inform the House of Commons of theobjections, from the point of view of our generalEuropean&apos;policy,  to a breach with Soviet Russia,and should reinforce his arguments (as set forthto the Cabinet at previous meetings) by referenceto the nervousness&apos; already shown by diplomatistsat the threat of a rupture of relations hinted atin the Note to Russia.1.    The Cabinet had a further discussion inregard to Russia,  in view of the Debate in bothHouses of Parliament the sane afternoon.
The Secretary.of State for Foreign affairs was asked,  in this part of his speech, to bear inmind the importance of not giving the impressionto  Soviet Russia that, owing to  the Europeanaspects of the question, we are powerless andtied.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was left full discretion to state, if he thought fit,  that the Government&apos;s intention was to watch the situation carefully and to consider their action from time- to time, but leaving open the exact form that a breach with Russia would take if it should eventually be decided on.The question was raised as to whether usecould not be made of the information contained inO.I.D. Paper- No.655-B, regarding the extension of soviet influence in A.3ia, with an illustrativemap,  the information in which,  it was s\iggestsd,might be used to show that it was Soviet Rtrssiaand not Great Britain that was really theIirperial is tic nation, insomuch as a great partof China and Central Asia had been absorbed byBolshevist methods.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to  look into this.

2. The Secretary, of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that there were some indica-tions o^ communications passing between Chang Tso-linand the Cantonese, which night perhaps result inan agreement between the teo instead of in a greatbattle .    In such an eventuality the tendency wouldbe to strengthen the Moderates in the South.Sir Austen Chamberlain said he was having thequestion of the future of the Shanghai Settlementsstudied v/ith a view to deciding how far we could go if other Powers were willing to discuss thematter.The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet that Sun Ghuan-fang seemed to have disappointment -appeared.    Chang Tsung Chang was reported to havefrom 8,000 to 20,000 troops between Shanghai andthe Cantonese.    There was some evidence that theCantonese did not mean to attack Shanghai and wereturning towards Nanking.
3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer brought tothe notice of the Cabinet the question of the incidence of cost of the Indian Mixed Brigade ofthe Shanghai Defence Force, on which he was a tissue with the Secretary of State for India.In view of the absence, through indispositionof the Secretary of State for India, the cabinet were reluctant to discuss this question, but thePermanent Under-Secretary of State and the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary were present to representLord Birkenhead, since it was necessary to provide an answer to the following Question addressed tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer the same afternoon:Mr Lansbury, - To ask Mr Chancellorof the Exchequer, whether the whole cost of the sending of the indian troops to China will be a charge onthe imperial revenue.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  That the reply should be to the effectthat the question had not yet beendiscussed with the Government of Indiaand that consequently no statement could be made.
IpousIrene e &apos;let 46I CoR&quot; ^lion 12.)4..  The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of the Commit t98 of Imperial Defence(Paper CP.-71 (27)) covering -A Memorandum by the Oversea DefenceCommittee (C.I.D. Paper No.770-B):The Minutes of the 221st Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defenceheld on February 25, 1927, in whichthe following Conclusions wererecommended to the Cabinet:-(a) That for the purpose of maintaininginternal order in Iraq adequate airforces must be located in that country,and that In the Interests of Imperialdefence in the Middle East it was desirable that these forces shouldbe British.(b) That the High Commissioner should be advised that internal security shouldbe the primary consideration in deciding on the organisation to beadopted for the Iraq Army, but thatafter the necessary provision forits maintenance has been made , theremaining military resources shouldbe organised with a view to delayingor repelling external aggression.For this purpose a mixed&quot;Brigademight be formed in the first instance.(c) That the Treasury, Colonial Officeand Air Ministry should submit for early consideration suggestions fora new agreement with Iraq, to succeedthe military agreement which terminatesin 1928, based&quot;on the following prin-ciples:-(i)That., at the desire of the IraqGovernment, British Air forces will remain located in Iraq andwill be normally at the call ofthe Government for assisting tomaintain Internal order.    Since,however, these Air Forces are essential to th9 scheme for british air defence in the Middle East,and, as indicated below, they winbe largely maintained at theexpense of the British Exchequer,Greao Britain must reserve the rito call on them for use elsewhereif and when the need arises.(ii) That Iraq will, In principle,after 1927-28, assume fullfinancial responsibility forall her own forces, whether landor aii1, and win bear the extraoost involved in stationing
British Air Forces (and any british troops necessary totheir protection) in Iraqinstead of at home, hut thatthe possibility of obtainingsome small financial assistancefrom Great Britain during theperiod of transition should notbe precluded without furtherinv estigation.(iii)That Great Britain will have the recognised right to carry outthe naval defence of Iraq andof the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab, which, for reasons of oilsupply, are of vital importanceto the Nav,y.(d) That the Treasury, Colonial Officeand Air Ministry should enquire intothe possibility of assisting to meetthe capital expenditure involved inthe&quot;reorganisation of the defence forces by generous treatment in thematter oi transferring to the IraqGovernment buildings vacated by imperial troops , and military storeswhich it is not considered necessaryto remove from the country on thewithdrawal of the British forces.The Cabinet approved the above recommendations by the Committee of Imperial Defenc

Pape r No.732-B.)A summary of -previous decisions in regard to Chemical WarfarePolicy, which had already been circulated in connection with an earlier discussion by the Cabinet(Paper CP.-295 (26)).The main point submitted for the decisionof the Cabinet was the general policy to b9adopted in regard to Chemical Warfare;    that isto say, should we change the policy we havehitherto adopted of denouncing Gas as a methodof warfare, or should we in future advocate theinternational recognition of this weapon aslegitimate and not necessarily inhuman?In approving generally the Conclusions ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence at their 221stMeeting,  the Cabinet agreed  (a)  That, in regard to  recommendation(b) by the Committee of ImperialDefence,  to the effect that theattention of the public  should bedrawn to the activities of SovietRussia in the production of wargas,  the best method would be byQuestion and Answer in the Houseof Commons, to be arranged by theSecretary of State for War:
(b) That, in view of the attitudehitherto taken in regard to theuse of gas,  it was undesirable that this country shoiild evertake the initiative in the useof gas in the field without first taking some favourable opportunity to notify to all nations our conviction that our previous attitude was no longerjustified by the facts of thesituation:    but that, moreparticularly in view of thedanger to which cities areexposed from, gas attack andthe difficulty of providingagainst this risk as set forth in the Report of the Sub-Con-mitteeof the Committee of Imperial defence on Air Raids Precautions  (paper cp.-456 (25)), the time had notyet come for making 3uch a declara-tion:(c) That at the forthcoming Conferenceat Geneva, if the question were raised the British representatives should be guided by the followingConclusion reached at the 217thMeeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, attended by the representa-tives of the Dominions and India:-&quot;That the policy in regard tothe ratification of the GenevaGas Protocol of 1925 shouldbe as follows:-&apos;To adopt a neutral attitudeuntil other Powers havesignified their intention,and to ratify only if other powers do so1&quot;.
