5.      The Cabinet had under consideration thesituation arising out of the approach to Hong-Kongof the transports conveying the first part of theIndian mixed brigade destined for Shanghai.The discussion on this question lasted from11.30 a,m.  to 1.30 p.:n., and approximately from.45 until 5.45 p,m.      During the discussion thePrime Minister read a letter from the Chancellorof the Exchequer setting forth his views.The situation before the Cabinet was asfollows :-The first transports have been ordered bythe Secretary of State for IVar,  instead of proceedingdirect to Shanghai, to call for orders at hong-Kong, where they are due to arrive on sunday, February 6th.       an urgent question arises,therefore, as to whether v.\-.ey should proceed to shangai or not.      On this point the informationbefore the Cabinet was as follows:-(l)    From a purely military point of. view therewas no evidence of imminent danger to Shanghai,whether from an attack by the Cantoneseforces,  or from the arrival there of a rabbleof defeated soldiery.      In this respect theimmediate danger appeared to be no greaterthan when the decision was reached to send troops to Shanghai, while the approach ofthe forces ordered out for the defence ofthe settlement safeguarded the future.(2)    From the point of view of internal security against mob violence the particulars in Appen-rill X &apos;jz,    ^fumichod to tho Foreign Offioefey-tho Conora1 Staff) indicate that ample
international forces for the maintenance of orderare at or within easy reach of Shanghai.(3) Eugene Chen on February 1st at the last momentrefused to sign the agreement which had been reached in regard to the British settlements at Hankow andKiukiang unless we refrained from landing our forcesat Shanghai.    But he has not carried out his vaguepromise to give Mr 0&apos;Malley In writing an assurance thatthe Nationalist Government would not countenance an alteration in the status oi the British Concessionand international settlements except by negotiation.There was evidence also that Chen&apos;s reasons were apretextf as he had known of our intention to send troops to Shanghai since the&apos; beginning of the negptia-tions, and had admitted that he had found points inthe agreements which needed revision.  (Mi- 0&apos;Malley&apos;stelegrams fr-om Hankow, Nos. 32 of January 31st,35 arid 36 &amp;f February 1st.)(4) Chen may have been encouraged to seize upon thetroop movements as an excuse for not signing by the published resolution of the Joint Labour Cauncil andspeeches by certain Labour leaders.    There was evidence that British publio opinion, while support-in g the action taken by the Government to protect british lives in China, was very anxious for a friendly settlement.(5) Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram indicated that the outward opposition ef Northern China to the advent of British troops at Shanghai need probably not betaken too seriously (Peking Telegram No.234 ofFebruary 4th).    But the Japanese Government would prefer that British troops should not he landed at shangai, and were anxious as to the possible results in stirring up anti-fcreign sentiments in China, wherethere
are large numbers of Japanese.    (Tokyo telegramNo. 61 of February 3rd and earlier telegrams).The United States of America were known tosome extent to share the views of Japan.(6)    Sir Hies Lamps on had been advised that we would on no account give way to the Cantonese threats,or show any vacillation as to the destination of the Shanghai force at this stage, but(evidently not realising how near the Indian mixedbrigade is to Shanghai) had proposed to postpone the decision as to landing it at Shanghai or at Hong-Kong.      Mr.  0&apos;Malley (Telegram No. 234of February 3rd.) doubted if Chen could givesatisfactory ansurances or whether the Governmenthe represents has the power to fulfil them, and considered that our interests and population at shangai were toe large to gamble with.    (iir.OtMalley (Hankow) No. 41 of February 3rd).The Governor of Hong-Kong (in a private telegram to the Secretary of State) was opposed toconcessions to Chen and the Commodore, Hong-Kong,(in a telegram to the Admiralty) stated thatthe diversion to Hong-Kong of the Suffolkregiment previously decided on, would havepolitical effects.      The Consul-General at shangai had expressed the view that any changeof policy would have a disastrous effect locally,and might prejudice the situation in general,(Shanghai telegram. No.  29 of 31st January).(7) The diversion of troops to Rei-hai-wel wasdeprecated by Sir Miles Lampson as calculated to arouse all China.    (Pekin telegram No. 235,February 3rd).(8)   According to a message received during themeeting, by the Secretary of State for War, the 8.
are large numbers of Japanese.    (Tokyo telegramNo. 61 of February 3rd and earlier telegrams).The United States of America were known tosome extent to share the views of Japan.(6)    Sir Piles Lamps on had been advised that we would on no account give way to the Cantonese threats,or show any vacillation as to the destination .of the Shanghai force at this stage, but(evidently not realising how near the Indian mixedbrigade is to Shanghai) had proposed to postpone the decision as to landing it at Shanghai or at Hong-Kong.      Mr.   01Mailey (Telegram No. 234of February 3rd.) doubted if Chen could givesatisfactory ansurances or whether the Governmenthe represents has the power to fulfil them, and considered that our interests and population at shangai were too large to gamble with.    (iir.OrMalley (Hankow) No. 41 of February 3rd).The Governor of Hong-Kong (in a private telegram to the Secretary of State) was opposed toconcessions to Chen and the Commodore,  Hong-Kong,(in a telegram to the Admiralty) stated thatthe diversion to Hong-Kong of the Suffolkregiment previously decided on, would havepolitical effects.

whole British division could,  if necessary,jjl]      &quot;loe^ccomm^dated/ in Hong-Kong.y^[9)    Accommodation for a brigade was available on british property at Shanghai, but there wasdoubt as to the reception which the troops would be given by the Municipality andby the Foreign Consular Body there.      Onthis point the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had already asked forfurther information.      (Foreign office telegram No. 27 of February 3rd tj SirS. Barton). &quot;Thus, while the particular emergency for whichthe troops had been despatched had not arisenat Shanghai, all the British representatives inChina (with the exception of Mr.  Teichman, ofthe Peking Legation, who is at Hankow withMr.  0! i-alley, but whose views Mro  OrMalley doesnot support) appeared to be opposed to anydiversion of troops on the basis of possibleassurances by Eugene Chen;    but the japanese and United States Governments, whom theCabinet were anxious not to antagonise, wereapprehensive as to the possible reactions ofa landing of our troops at Shanghai,,
With reference to the phrase in Mr 0&apos;Malley&apos;telegram No.234, quoted in (6) above, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs said that there could he no question of the Government gambling in the lives of the British at Shanghai.    There was already at Shanghai a force of 4,000 men   the numberconsidered necessary to control the mob;    the troops had been sent because of the danger of an immediateadvance on Shanghai by the Nationalist Armies;   butwhilst our advance troops were now in Far Easternwaters , the Nationalist Army was no nearer to shangai.As regards the signature of the agreement and theguarantee, the Secretary of State explained that his view was that throughout the negotiations therehad been a struggle between Borodin and the Bolshe-vist influences on the one side, who were opposed toany agreement, and the more moderate opinion,repre--sented by Chen,   which desired to accept so liberalan offer.    The value of the conclusion of theagreement would lie in the proof that the Moderateshad triumphed and had succeeded in defeating Borodin.At present victory lay with the Bolsheviks.The proposals considered by the Cabinet were asfollows:-
That a telegram should be sent to Sir idlesLunpson and Mr.  01. alley,  instructing the&apos;latter,  if the former agreed, to tell EugeneChen that, if he would sign the agreement inregard to the Hankow and Kiukiang Concessionsand would give on behalf of the nationalist government a guarantee against a repetitionat Shanghai of the violence used at Hankowand Kiukiang, we in return would stop our forces at HengoeKong and Singapore.      In themeantime the transports would be  stopped at Hong-Kong.While it was recognis ed that to stopour forces might have been justifiable ifthe agreement had been signed, in viewofChen&apos;s attitude and the advice of the man onthe spot,  It was felt bymny Members of theCabinet that this course would be regarded asa sign of weakness and would be dangerous.      TheCabinet w.re also informed that It was doubtfulwhether the transports Eould be kept at Hong-*Kong with the troops on board for more than afew hours owing to the difficulties ulty of ventilationwhilo the ships were stationary.      To land thetroops temporarily would take time and perhapshave serious political effectso
A variant of the above proposal was to instructMr 0&apos;Malley, subject to Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s agreement,to tell Eugene Chen that the movement of the IndianMixed Brigade to Shanghai oould not be stopped, butthat , 11 he would sign the Hankow and Kiukiangagreements and would give guarantees and take measures to avoid and discourage violence at shangai, the troops would not be landed.This course was felt to be open to some of theobjections to the first proposal, and it was pointedout that Mr 0&apos;Malley (though avowedly not acting under instructions) had made suggestions to EugeneChen on these lines on the occasion of the latter1srefusal to sign &quot;the agreements (Mr 0&apos;Malley (Hankow)No.36 of 1st February).A third suggestion was that, following on theJapanese advice that British troops should not be landed at Shanghai (Sir J. Tilley, No. 61 of February3rd), a tele.gram should be sent to Tokyo to the effectthat we were now in course of obtaining a defensiveforce in the East which was adequate for any emergencylikely to arise;   that we were anxious not to causeany risk to Japanese nationals in other parts ofChina by landing the troops;    that if the JapaneseGovernment desired us to k^ep the bulk of our forces at hong-Kong we would be glad to do so pending consulta-tion with them, always supposing that there was noemergency at Shanghai, and that our representatives in China regarded this as a safe course.    A correspond-ing communication, mutatis mutandis, would be made to washington.    If this   policy v;ere adopted it was proposed to ma^e no further communication to EugeneChen.
On a review of these proposals and severalvariants of them, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should telegraphthe two latter alternatives toSir Miles Lamp son and invite hisvie^s on the whole situation: (Appendix(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should also consultSir Miles Lampson (l) as to whetherthe landing or accommodation ofadditional troops in Shanghaiwould meet with difficulties fromthe Consuls-General of other powers or from the Municipality, and(2) as to the attitude of hisJapanese and American colleagues as to the anxiety shown by theirrespective Governments lest their nationals elsewhere in China should be endangered^ by our raove-ments:(c) That a further meeting of theCabinet should be held on Monday,February 7th, at 11-30 a.m. tooonsider Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s reply:(d) That the Secretary of State for war should make arrangements for retardingthe arrival of the Indian Mixed Brigadeat Shanghai, either by ordering the transports to proceed at slow speedor to make a short stay at Hong-Kong,or both, subject, of course, to norisks being: run from a medical pointof view on the score of properventilation of the ships.2, Whi tehal l Ga id ens, S.W. 1,February 4, 1927.

Our present information leaves us in some doubt as to actual position at Shanghai.      Danger of violent outbreaks seems less imminent than when troop movements were ordered, and in any case there is one additional battalion already at Shanghai.Views expressed by Baron Shi debar a in Tokio tele-gram No.61 and Washington telegram No.68 reo^uirecareful consideration.
