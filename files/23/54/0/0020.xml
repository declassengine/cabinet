CHINA[previous reference:Qabinst 19dusion 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a draft-Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence, whichhad received the general approval of theChiefs of Staff but was still subject to correc-tion in detail (Paper C.P.-110 (27)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the evidence accumu-lating in regard to the outrage at Nankingshowed that the circumstances had been evenworse than at first anticipated, and inculpatedthe Chinese Nationalist Army.    He drew attentionto telegram No,547 from the British Minister at peking, containing identic recommendations whichwere being made by the Eritish, American and japanese Ministers to their respective Govern-menta for punishment, apology and reparation-    ,      -in respect of the Nanking episode.     these recommendations had since received the whole-hearted support of the French and ItalianMinisters  (Peking Telegram No.554) .   He hadreceived a suggestion, which appeared worthy of consideration, that a demand should be made forthe Chinese Commander-in-Chief to parade withthe troops responsible for the outrage and make a formal apology to the representatives ofthe Powers concerned.   Sir Austen Chamberlaininvited the Cabinet to note that the sanctionsproposed by the diplomatic representatives ofthe Powers at Peking coincided closely with thosesuggested by the Committee of Chiefs of Staff.The latter, however, had pointed out, in addition,that the British or International forces command-ing the river had it in their power to prevent
the further advance northward of the Cantoneseforces by prohibiting the passage of the Yangtse.This proposal had also been made to him independ-ently in the Foreign Office.In this connection the Cabinet were reminded that such action would do much to avert the riskof trouble at Tientsin or Peking.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssupported strongly the plea of the Chiefs ofStaff Committee In favour of international action at the present juncture, and referred to symptomsof a tendency on the part of certain nationsonce more to leave all the odium of initiative and action to Great Britain while themselvesderiving equal advantage therefrom.A suggestion was made that the Secretaryof State ^or War should consider the desirabilityof sending out additional Battalions to Hong-Kongyas unostentatiously as possible, with a view to a gradual increase in the available reserves of force in the Far East in a situation of greatfuture uncertainty.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generall;/ the Conclusionsof the Committee of Chiefs of Staff(Paper CP.-110 (27)):(b) That the First Lord of the admiralty should send a telegram to the naval commander-in-chief,  for communicationalso to the General Officer Commai d-- ing the Shanghai Defence Force, andto be repeated by the Naval Commander-.ral of the Fleet in-Chief to Sir Miles Lampson, con-Bsatty, who was taining a summary of the Report ofttited by the the Chiefs of Staff Committee andretary about this the Conclusions in full (Paper C.P.-&apos;he telephone, 110 (27)) and inviting Admiral Sir&quot;-urrsd in the Reginald Tyrwhitfs views on theliability of this feasibility of the plans proposedion,) as a means for putting pressure upon the Cantonese Government:
(a)  That, provided the Commahdsr-in- 63 0Chief concurred,  the Secretary ofState should take such steps as might be neoessary at Peking andthe other Capitals to secure theco-operation in these measuresof the five Powers:(d) That if the Powers are unwilling to join in appropriate sanctions,the question of the action to betaken should be brought beforethe Cabinet for a fresh decision:(e) That, as regards Tientsin, theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should inform Sir miles lampson of the objections of theChiefs of Staff to his proposal in telegram No. 542 that an addi-tional Battalion should be sent,and should take up with theJapanese Government the whole position in regard to the&quot;securityof Peking and Tientsin:(f) That, as regards the british nationals in the Upper Yangtse, theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send a telegram to the British Minister at Pekingsuggesting that the time had comefor him to send instructions witha view to the immediate withdrawalof the British inhabitants, whohenceforward should be warned thatthey remained entirely at theirown risk and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had no responsibilityfor their safety.
