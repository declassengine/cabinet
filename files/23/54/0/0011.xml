The Cabinet met as a matter of urgency to decidepolitical and military questions arising out of thelatest developments in China.The military position as reported to the cabinet was as follows:-   General Sun Chuan-fang&apos;s armycovering Shanghai had sustained a reverse within 15miles of Hangchow, which was expected to fall immedi-ately, and news was received during the meeting thatHangchow was being evacuated.    Sun&apos;s forces, some ofwhich were reported to have gone over to the Cantonese,were falling back on a prepared position.    But itappeared not impossible that within five days Cantonesetroops might reach the vicinity of Shanghai, wheretrouble night be apprehended either from the arrival ofbeaten troops, possibly with Cantonese in close pursuitfrom boycott and strikes , resulting in food shortageand riot;    from a desire by either side to use Shanghaias a base;    or, less probably, from an actual attack byCantonese troops.In these circumstances the Naval Conmander-in-Chief , China, in accordance with the authority given him by the. Cabinet (Cabinet 8 (27), Conclusion 2 (b)),had ordered the second (British) Brigade to proceeddirect to Shanghai, where it would be necessary,  e-a?r^a-s-eB-s--e-f-ac^mme^ia^tien-, to billet the troops on british property outside the settlement limits, but within the Municipal developed area, where their presence was essential for tactical reasons (NavalCommand3r-innChief to Admiralty No. 808, of 16thFebruary).    On the previous evening the Prime Ministerand Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who, onthe first receipt of this telegram, had been under theimpression that these troops would be arriving at
Shanghai at. an early date , had asked the First Lordof-the Admiralty to direct the Commander-in-Chief to suspend this order pending farther instructions(Admiralty telegram to CoiJiriander-in-Chief, China,Mo.485, dated February 16, 1927), their intention being that these should be issued after consideration bythe Cabinet of the political matters referred to below,which might be affected by the arrival of further troops.The Cabinet were informed that at the present timeabout 9,000 men were, or would shortly be , available forIrthe defence of the international settlement at Shanghaiagainst mob violence (including the nrLxed IndianBrigade and other British troops , naval ratings andMarines;    1,100 .Americans;    1,100 Japanese;    and&apos; 100Italians).    The Suffolk Regiment was being brought to shangai from Kong-Kong, where there were severalcruisers from which about 800 men could be landed.In these circumstances the Chief of Ihe ImperialGeneral Staff was reportea to hold the view that, on the arrival of the two British Brigades (the first due at shangai between February 28th and March 2nd, thesecond between March 4th and March 7th) it would be safe to return the Indian troops to India, thereby savingheavy expense to Imperial funds, and that, taking intoconsideration the naval ratings and Marines (to say nothing of the foreign landing parties) the equivalent of the infantry of a Division (which he had estimated to be required) would still remain available at Shanghai,and would be sufficient for any emei genoy that was likelyto arise.The military questions before the Cabinet, then,were as follo&apos;is:-(i) Should the Indian troops be sent backto India on the arrival of the two british Brigades?
(ii) Should the suspension of the navalComiuander-in-chief s order for thesecond Brigade to proceed to Shanghaibe lifted?On the political side the Cabinet had before themMr 0&apos;Malley&apos;s telegram No.74, of February 15th, toPeking, giving particulars of the second breakdown ofhis negotiations with Eugene Chen, and Mr Lampson&apos;scommentary thereon (Peking telegram No.296 of February17th).From these telegrams it appeared that Eugene Ohenprofessed to be ready to sign the agreements in regardto Hankow and Kiukiang concessions , as well as to give assurances not bo use force or to countenance the uaeof force to effect changes in the&quot; status of the conces-sions and International settlements, but that, inaddition to a protest against the landing of troops at Shanghai, after the signature he insisted on issuinga statement (apparently to be addressed to the world at large rather than to this country in particular) to theeffect that no Chinese authorities except the CantoneseNationalist Government were entitled to negotiate withforeign Powers regarding settlements (For text of proposed statement see Appendix).  It was not clear whetherthis was intended merely as a formal protest or whetherEugene Chen&apos;s signature would be conditional on our pre-acceptance of this latter statement, the latter being an impossible condition, as negotiations have already been opened with the Peking Cabinet.Mr 0&apos;Malley and Mr Lampson appeared to think thatwhen it came to the point Mr Chen would still refuse to sign, but were opposed to the signature of the agree-ments in the circumstances.    The Cabinet, however,agreed unanimously that Eugene Chen had virtually
offered to accept the terms recently stated by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, with their full assent, in the House of Commons, aid that for theBritish Government to refuse the terms at the verymoment when British troops have arrived at Shanghaiwould he to get themselves represented as responsiblefor a break and as having been merely playing for timepending the arrival of the troops.    Moreover, an offer to sign would either result in the conclusion of agreements, as desired, or, at the worst, throw on theCantonese the onus for a break.The Cabinet agreed  (a) On the Political Issue.    That theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should authorise Mr 0&apos;Malley to sign the Hankow and Kiukiang agreements!&quot;And that the Secretary of State should arrange , at such moment and in suohmanner as he deemed best (e.g. , either at Hankow or in Parliament, or both),to take note of the first two para-graphs of the statement to be made byMr Eugene Chen (Appendix) setting outthe undertaking not to attack Shanghai,and, as regards the third paragraph,to make clear that His Majesty^s Govern-ment could not bind themselves^to enterinto negotiations with official personsIn any part of China where such personsrepresent a de facto authority:(b) As regards the Indian Mixed Brigade.That the question &apos;of&quot; &quot;the possiblereturn to India of the Indian MixedBrigade was not urgent, as the secondBrigade of the Shanghai Defence force could not begin to arrive at Shanghaibefore February 28th, and could be postponed for a week:(c) As regards the second Brigade of the shanghai Defence Forced    That, hotwith-standing the strong politioal objectionsto billeting troops outside the inter-national settlement, even on british property, in view of the NavalCommandsr-in-chief s statement thatthis measure was necessary for tacticalreasons, his responsibility ought not tobe interfered with.    Consequently, thatthe First Lord of the Admiralty should telegraph to the Naval Coimuander-in-Chief,China, to explain that the telegramsuspending his order to the secondBrigade to proceed direct to Shanghaihad &quot;been sent in order to give theCabinet time to consider, the position;-4-
that they had done so;    and that, hewas now authorised, if he still desired,to repeat or confirm his previousorder;    that a military appreciation of the situation was being telegraphedto the Officer Commanding &quot;Troops, Shanghai,and that he should consider the questionof the destination of the second Brigadewith him during the approach of the transports to Shanghai:(d) That the Secretary of State for war should telegraph to the Officer Com-manding Troops at Shanghai an apprecia-tion by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff of the military position there:(e) To take note that the Shanghai defence force is taking sufficient supplies tobe self-supporting in the event of aboycott or strike at Shanghai, airl to invite the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to examine whether it would be prudent or useful to consult with other powers concerned as to the action to betaken in the international settlement at shangai in the event of a boycott:(f) To take note that the medical authorities at the War Office consider that Hong-Kongis net a particularlyvhealthy steticn for troops;   and that the^over-crowninginvolved in maintaining more than a brigade there is undesirable from a medical point of view, particularly. - after the beginning of the rainy season(possibly March 15th) , after which troopsought not to be kept under canvas-itehall Gardens, S.W. 1,February 17, 1927.
Statement to be &apos;nade by hr. Eugene Chen after the signature of Hankow and JCiukiang Agreements.*  *   4&apos;8ee Hr. 0&apos;..alley&apos;s telegram (Hankow) No.  52of February 15th.)...In manifesto of January 22nd ishtionalist Governmentdeclared their intention and their immediate  readiness tohave all questions outstanding between nationalist Chinaand foreign Powers settled by negotiation and agreement.This implicitly applied, and was intended so to apply,  to question of status of British and^ other concessions and international settlements in China.    (nr.  0&apos;Malley (Hankow),No. 48 of 8th February).This necessarily means that policy of nationalist government is not to use force or to countenance the useof force to effect changes in status of any or allconcessions and International settlements.The Nationalist Government have to lay it down that changes in status of concessions and international settlementswherever situated in China are of such vital and national importance that no local or other Chinese authorities saveand except National Government can negotiate with foreign powers concerned in respect thereof,   (tir.  0&apos;iialley (Hankow),No.&apos; 54 of February 15th).
