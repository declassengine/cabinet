6Cd1. The Cabinet had before them Reports by theCommittee of Chiefs of Staff, with the following the Situation in China, withspecial reference to the Yangtse(Paper C.P.-123 (27)):The Situation at Canton (Paper CP.-125 (27)):The Situation in China, withspecial reference to Peking andTientsin (Paper CP.-126 (27)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised two questions for decision:-(i) The reply to be sent to Sir MilesLaTrpson&apos;s telegram Wo. 634, ofApril 7th (CP.-126 (27) Appendix (B))in regard to the possible evacuation,in case of danger, of Peking andTientsin: and(ii) The question as to whether, in thenot improbable event of a non-compliance by the Cantonese Governmentwith the demands in connection withthe Nanking outrages and of a continuedunwillingness of the other powers concerned to impose sanctions, weshould be prepared to act alone.Sir Austen Chamberlain gave full information as tothe present position on both these questions.In the course of the discussion, Admiral ofthe Fleet Earl Beatty made a statement in regard tothe effectiveness of the sanctions proposed.    he recalled that at the Meeting at the House of commons on April 4th (Cabinet 23 (27),  Conclusion 1), he,on behalf of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, had warned the Cabinet in regard to the adverse effecton sanctions of any serious delay.    The situation had now changed considerably and this statement requiredqualification.    In view of the successes of theNorthern Chinese, the period of ten days he had then mentioned could perhaps be considerably extended,-1-
but it had to be borne in mind that-if the Northern forcesgained possession of the places where sanctions were tohave been inflicted, these particular sanctions would no longer be applicable.   Moreover, to take the proposedsanctions at the present moment against such objects asforts or arsenals which were likely in the near future to fall into the hands of the Northern Chinese might merelyhave the effect o&quot;f antagoni s inn; the Northerners, who might be counting on utilising th--r for- their own purposes.If, on the other hand,  the Southern Chinese were to regainthe ascendancy, it might be that the time within wbd chthe proposed sanctions could be applied effectively wouldbe extremely limited,  in which case,  either as Chief ofthe Naval Staff or as Senior&apos;Officer of the Committeeof Chiefs of Staff, it .might be his duty to warn theCabinet of the need of an urgent decision.    In any eventLord Beatty felt that if isolated action on our part were contemplated,  a different form of sanctions was required.They ought to be applied somewhere out o^ the line of theNorthern advance,  possibly,  for example,   at Canton.    Hethought that  the circtrmstances were so changed that, thewhole question of sanctions ought to be entirely, re-considered .The suggestion was made that, in re-examining thequestion of sanctions, the Chiefs of Staff Committee should consider the possibility and advisability, from a military point of view, of the re-occupation of the british  Conces-s 1 on at Hankow..A suggestion was also made that,  in view of the uncertainty of *he -situation; i.t&apos; would be desirable torender the Shanghai. Defence Force more mobile than atpresent,  and that all possible eventualities in China should be studied by the Committee of Chiefs of Staff.
The Cabinet agreed &apos; (a) In r egard, to Peking and Tientsin:That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send telegrams to Washington and Tokyo on the linesof the draft telegrams attached asEnclosure 3 to Appendix (A) to theChiefs of Staff Report (Paper O.P.-126 (27) - revised in accordancewith the Report of the Chiefs ofStaff Committee and the cabinet discussion), setting forth the dangers of the situation and the limitations of our own means ofco-operation for the defence ofthese places:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send, atelegram to Sir Miles Lamps onexplaining the situation and stating that, failing a satiafac-tory response to his representa-tions to Tokyo and Washington, his existing instructions must stand,viz., to evacuate Peking and Tientsinin the event of danger, of which hewas the only possible judge:fc)  In regard to Sanctions:    That theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should make strong represent-ations to the Powers who had co-operated in the representations to  the nationalist government in respect of the Nankingoutrages, in favour of united actionIn such sanctions as might be deemedappropriate, and that, pending theresult of these representations,there could be no question of isolatedaction by. this country in applyingsanctions.The question of isolated action inthe event of a refusal by other Powersto co-operate was reserved for later consideration in case of necessity:(d)  In regard to  the form of Sanctions:That the Committee of Chiefs of staff should meet to re-examine the question in the light of the present situation on the alternative hypotheses of the sanctions being undertaken by aninternational force or by thiscountry alone.      The Chiefs of staff committee were asked to keep thissubject constantly under reviewas the situation changes from timeto time .
 .    Ilia Secretary of&quot; State for War drew theattention of the Cabinet to a Declaration whichhad been signed in 1907,  among other nations,  onbehalf of this country and also on behalf of China,forbidding the dropping of bombs from the air.The Cabinet agreed  That the War Office should writeofficially to the Foreign office with a vie&apos;- to ascertaining theviews of their Legal Adviser onthis question.
3. The Cabinet had before there a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (paper cp.-114 (27)), and a Note by the Secretary ofState covering a despatch from Lord Lloyd (paper cp.-121 (27)), both on the subject of the strengthof the Egyptian Army.    These documents indicatedagreement between the Foreign Office and the CairoResidency as  to the immediate object of our policyin Egypt, namely, to put an end to the process bywhich the Wafd are seeking to uproot any vestigeof British influence in the Egyptian Army and  tomake it a political weapon, but indicated a diver-ganoe of view as to the methods to be adopted.Lord Lloyd, &quot;whose views are supported by Sir WilliamTyrrell, now on a visit to Egypt,  desires, first,with a view to restoring the authority and prestige of the present Inspector-General,  that we shoulddemand that his  right to the powers of Sirdarshould be acknowledged by the Egyptian Government,and that he should be given the acting rank ofFerik (corresponding to that of a Divisional&apos;Oor.&apos;:m.ander) with a suitable Increase in salary;,second, that we should insist on the appointmentof a senior British Officer at headqxiarters asAssistant Inspector-General to act for the Sirdarin his absence;    third,  that we should insist onthe Frontiers Administration (which will involvethe coastguards also as soon as effect is givento the proposed amalgamation) coming under the direct authority or the Ins pector-General.    Inreturn for the concession of these three demands,Lord Lloyd proposes that.we should acquiesce in the raising of the nine Egyptian battalions to a higher
establishment (involving an addition of 36 officersand 1,620 men), in the reduction of military service from 5 to 3 years, and in the development of a sr. all military Air service.    Und^r Lord Lloyd&apos;s proposals the acquisition of 22 machine-guns by the egyptian government would be made conditional on the Egyptian-Government carrying out faithfully for a reasonable period their side of the above arrangements, though he intends to leave this question alone,  if possible.He asks for authority to make an approach to theEgyptian Government with a view to carrying out these proposals, warning them that if they refuse toaccept we are left with no alternative but to regard the Egyptian Army as hostile to us, and that in that event we should be forced to take without delay such measures as we consider necessary to safeguard ourrights and interests ..The Foreign Office propose a draft military agreement under which the Egyptian Government would undertake to maintain the Egyptian Army at a strength to be determined by Lord Lloyd in consultation withG.O.C. Egypt, while His Majesty&apos;s Government under-take that the available British forces should besufficient, in co-operation with the Egyptian Armyand His Majesty&apos;s Fleet,  to protect Egypt fromaggression from whatever quarter&apos;    that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should furnish instructional and technical personnel, while the Egyptian Government would undertake to employ no foreign personnel other than british&apos;and would not allow their own personnel tobe trained abroad except in Great Britain&apos;    HisMajesty&apos;s Government would also furnish munitions of war at cost price, while the Egyptian Governmentwould undertake to obtain these from no.other source,
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that he still preferred the Foreign Officeproposal, but that in view of the consensus ofopinion in favour of Lord Lloydrs plan among allthe authorities now in Egypt, he did not feel ableto press the Foreign Office alternative further.Ke warned the Cabinet that, whatever proposals were adopted,  the Government must be preparedto see them through, and that we might be confronted with, a serious situation in Egypt.The Cabinet agreed -To approve Lord Lloyd ls proposals as set forth in Paper C.P.-121  (27)Enclosure  (A), but that theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should make it clear toLord Lloyd that the Cabinet Verymuch hopes that he will not find it necessary to allow any additionalmachine-guns to be acquired for theuse of the Egyptian Army, as con-template d in Paragraph 34 of his despatch..
4. The Cabinet had before then; a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State  for &quot;otre Affairs and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (Paper C.P.-117 (27))  in regard to the boundary between northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, moreparticularly relating to  jurisdiction over LoughFoyle,The Cabinet were informed that Lord Craigavonhad written to Mr Oosgrave suggesting that the LawOfficers of the Irish Free State and NorthernIreland should meet to discuss the question,,In the meanwhile Lord Craigavon had givenassurances that he was not proceeding with theLough Foyle Fisheries Bill.The President of the Board of Trade asked that,  If discussions were taking place on thesubject of the Lough Foyle Fisheries, the questionsof the lights and pilotage should also be takeninto consideration.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question should stand over until after the conversations between the Law Officers referredto above:(b) That the Secretary of State for home Affairs and the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs should write to Lord Craigavon andMr Cos grave respectively asking that the questions of lights andpilotage might be included in anyconversations in regard to LoughFoyle.
5. The Cabinet had before them the Report of aCabinet Committee on the Poplar Audit Surchargescovering a draft Rill (Paper CP.-93 (27)).The Minister of Health gave the Cabinetexplanations in regard to the draft Bill, butwarned the Cabinet that it was not likely to benon-contentious.The question was raised as to whether theBill should provide for remission of the surchargesimposed on members of certain Borough Councils(Poplar, Woolwich and Bethnal Green) which theCourts had decided could not be  remitted by theMinister of Health,  or whether the procedure ofthe Bill should be made applicable to those cases.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Audit (LocalAuthorities) Bill,  1927, for introduction in the House ofCommons, subject to(b) The question of how the surchargesagainst members of the borough councils of Poplar, Woolwich andBethnal Green should be  dealt with,being settled by the Committee ofHome Affairs:(c) That the Minister of Health shouldha*re authority to make an announce-ment to the effect that the government intended to proceed with legislation on the subject during the present session, and should consult withthe Chief Whip as to the introduc-tion of such legislation.
6.  The Cabinet had before them Memoranda bythe First Commissioner of Works (Paper CP.-119(27)) and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(Paper 0 .P.-124 . (27)) in regard to the desire ofthe City Corporation, which controls BillingsgateMarket,  to obtain the site of the Customs Rousewith a view to extending, the Market buildings, inreturn for re-housing the Customs headquarters staff on a suitable site and in a suitable buildingAfter a short explanation by the first commissioner of Works, the Cabinet agreed  To postpone this question until after the Faster Recess.-10-
EQUAL FRANCHISE       7.    The Cabinet gave consideration, to a?6r men andjfOMEN. proposal that, since the Government are onlypledged to equal treatment to men and women(previous reference: but not to the adoption of any particular ageCabinet 26(27), Con- limit, this latter question should be left toelusion 4,)a free vote of the House of Commons.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreedTo adhere to their previous decisionto adopt as their policy the age of21 years for the exercise of the franchise by men and women on thesame terms.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,April 13,  1927,
