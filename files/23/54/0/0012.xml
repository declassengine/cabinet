1.  In addition to the Memoranda under considera-tion at the previous Meeting referred to in the margin, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-61 (27)),prepared at the request of the Cabinet, covering adraft alternative concluding paragraph to the draft note      to the Soviet Government, prepared by theForeign Office (Paper CP.-17 (27)).The view generally accepted by the Cabinet,after considerable discussion, was that, given thestate of public opinion in this country, if thepresent policy of the Russian Soviet Government was continued a breach of relations within the next fewmonths was almost, inevitable.    It was felt, however,that the present moment was- not opportune for a rupture of relations.    In this connection the cabinet were impressed by the grave consequences on the stateof unrest in Europe and on our international relationsgenerally which the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had warned them would result from a ruptureat the present moment, when no preparation for suohan eventuality had been undertaken.     Moreover, noespecially significant event had occurred, comparable to the publication of the Zinovieff letter or the intervention of the Russian Soviet in the general strike, to Justify a sudden rupture.    The Cabinetrealised that if bloodshed should unhappily occur inChina as the result of a policy instigated by the agents of        Soviet Russia, a breach might become inevitable.    It was thought that a warning ought tobe given to Soviet Russia which should make thisclear, without laying too much emphasis upon China asthe sole occasion for such a breach, since to do somight react adversely on our diplomatic negotiations in China itself.    The view met with support that if
a protest, conceived on these lines, failod toproduce a better attitude on the part of SovietRussia, it would at any rate be a useful first step in preparing the way, both at home and abroad, fora rupture of relations if this should later become inevitable.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should prepareas soon as possible for their consideration a re-draft, in thelight of the discussion, of the note to -the Soviet government attached to CP. -17 (27)).

3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health suggesting that the Governmentshould resist applications made by Liverpool ardWest Brorovioh to introduce Bills in the present session of Parliament to enable the Local Authoritiesto undertake the sale of coal (Paper CP.-36 (27)).After explanations by the Minister of health and the President of the Board of trade the cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Health should see representatives of the Corpora-tions concerned and&apos; should ask thattheir proposals might be withdrawn,explaining that the Government couldnot agree to piecemeal legislation,and that,if and when they&quot;were satis -fied that action was necessary, theGovernment would deal with it as ageneral question.
CHINA. 4* A G^ov^ discussion toot: pla.oe as to whetherthe appreciation by the Chief of the Imperial General(previous reference:       Staff, which the Cabinet at the meeting on theCabinet 11 , ^ix^^^j^-jj(27) , Con-      previous evening I see marginal note) had decidedolusion (d).) &apos;-should be sent to Shanghai, should be addressed tothe Officer Commanding the Indian Mixed Brigade, whowas commanding the troops already at Shanghai, or tothe Naval Commander-in-Chief, who was still responsi-ble for the protection arrangements.The question was remitted,, with full powers,to a Committee composed of -The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for India,The First Lord of the Admiralty -who arranged to meet in the Ministers&apos; conference room at the Rouse of Commons the same afternoon at p.m.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1,February 18, 1927.
