I MEETINGCABINET.1.    The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat the meeting arranged for that evening hadnot proved convenient to several of his colleagues,including the members of the House of Lords, andwould therefore have to be postponed.The Cabinet agreed  That a Meeting should be held on tuesday T MARCH 89th. at 11-30 a.m.for consideration of the following questions:-HOUSE OP LORDS REFORM.LEASEHOLD ENFRANCHISEMENT.
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had no information to suppler.&quot;ent the telegramsalready circulated to the Cabinet in regard to thesituation in China,  except in regard to a recentcase of piracy at Bias Bay.    The Governor of hong-Kong had telegraphed that if he did not receive instructions to the contrary he wouldtake the pre-arranged action in view of this latestpiracy.The Secretary of State for the Colonies,after consultation with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, had telegraphed to the Governornot to take action until he had consulted theBritish Minister at Peking.    Sir Miles Lampsonhad telegraphed to the Consul-General at Shanghaias to what effect the action would have in that region.    A telegram had now been received indieat-being that the Governor of Hong-Kong had apparentlytaken action on his own responsibility, but theposition was not clear enough to ask for any cabinet decision.
9 9 7Hi OP APMS 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsconsulted the Cabinet as to a letter which hadbeen received from Messrs Vickers in regard tothe supply of certain war material to the Sovietiferenoe:meet 3Oon- Government.jusion o.)Sir Austen Chamberlain informed hiscolleagues that in June, 1923, the Cabinet raisedno objection to the supply of 500 submarine minesby Messrs Vickers to the Soviet Government onthe ground that they would be used for purposesof defence only.    On November 12^ 1924, however,it was decided that the export of war material to Russia could not be permitted as it was incon-sistent with the attitude towards Russia taken up by members of the present Government duringthe General Election to sanction the equipment of Soviet Russia with British arms and munitions.In view of this decision, when Messrs Vickersenquired In October, 1925, whether they mightsupply the Soviet Government with small coast defence vessels and submarine mines for purelydefensive, purposes, the Cabinet referred thematter to the Naval, General and Air Staffs, whoexpressed the unanimous opinion that the supply should be permitted.    On January 29,  1926, theCabinet agreed that Messrs Vickers&apos; application should be granted (Cabinet 2 (.26), Conclusion 6).Messrs Vickers were accordingly informed onFebruary 3,, 1926,  that no objection was seen to .the export to Russia of the submarine mines andcoast defence vessels in question.   Messrs Vickershad now written to enquire whether the terms ofthat letter still held good.
The Cabinet agreed  That Messrs Vickers should be askedto say whether their letter referredto the export of the material sane-tioned on February 3, 1926, or to new contracts with the SovietGovernr ent.    If their letterreferred only to the old contractsthey should be allowed to proceedwith their fulfilment.    If, however,their letter referred to new contracts,the matter should be reported with full details to the Cabinet.
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet a full account of the situationin Albania as indicated in reoent telegrams already circulated to the Cabinet.    Sir Austen Chamberlainreported that, in view of the reluctance both ofSignor Mussolini and of the French Government tosubmit the question to the League of Nations, hehad responded to the Italian communicationdenouncing Tugo-Slav military activity on theAlbanian frontier by asking if the ItalianGovernment would agree to the despatch of theMilitary At%sell s art Beigrardre enF Great Britain,France and Germany, to make an investigation on both sides of the frontier.    In making thisproposal he was following a successful precedentset by the League in the case of the dispute between Greece and Bulgaria, and he had in mind^Ivt4 ,to work up to a point where two ^-t^rches of the--same neutral nationality might be stationed one on either side of the Yugo Slav - Albanianfrontier,  just as at present Military .A*%aeh^eof Swedish nationality are stationed on either side of the Grae co-Bulgarian frontier to invest!-gate any incident and report to the League ofNations.The policy of the  Secretary ofState was approved by the Cabinet.
