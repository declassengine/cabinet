The Cabinet had before thorn .a Report by theChiefs of Staff Committee (Paper CP.-115 (27))on the present situation in China and the questionof the sanctions behind an ultimatum to theCantonese Government for the outrages at Nanking.An amended copy of Sir Miles Lamps oh&apos;s telegramNo.605, dated April 2nd, was handed round duringthe meeting.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet a review of the present positionand read to the Cabinet, draft telegrams which he proposed to send to Peking and to Tokyo, Washington,Paris and Rome, in regard to the proposed ultimatum to the Cantonese Government in connection with theoutrages at Nanking.The Chiefs of Staff, who were present, answereda number of questions put to them.    In the courseof his replies the Chief of the Naval Staff laidgreat stress  on the importance of the time limitand the ill-effects on the imposing of sanctionswhich would result from delay.    He warned theCabinet that a delay of, say,  a month, would givethe Cantonese troops such opportunities tostrengthen their position that the proposals inthe Report of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff(Paper C.P.-115 (27)) might become impracticable.He considered that,  in order to give the opera-tions a reasonable prospect of success, they .ouffht to take place within a maximum of ten days from the present time.    In regard to recommendation(f)  in the Summary of Conclusions and Recommenda-tions (Paper CP.-115 (.27))  in favour of theimmediate withdrawal of all British nationals fromthe whole or the Yangtse, Lord beatty  suggestedthat if it was necessary (as the Secretary o^ State
for Foreign Affairs had intimated)  to retain a nucleus of officials andHraders,the last remnant might be brought down inmen-of-war.The Chief of the Imperial General Staffhanded round a map showing the present positionof the various Chinese forces, but emphasizedthat the war in China was conducted less byfighting than by bribery and propaganda.    he stated that the maintenance of a line of commu-nications. from the coast via Tientsin to Pekingrequired forces far- larger than could possibly&apos;be sent from this country.    Even to maintaincommunications between the sea and Tientsinwould, he estimated,  involve at least two and perhaps three Divisions.    Both the Chief of theNaval Staff and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff emphasized the repeated recommendation ofthe Committee of Chiefs of Staff that if theJapanese would not undertake this duty it wasbeyond our capacity,  and, as recommended in paper cp.-110 (27), the Legation and British interestsshould be withdrawn from both Peking and Tientsin.The Cabinet were informed that no officialconfirmation had yet been received of the press reports of a bombardment of Hankow by the JapaneseOn the question of the time factor in sanctionsthe Cabinet realised that there were risks in her-ent in any course which was taken.    On the mili-tary aspects of the question they realised theimportance of the warning of the Chiefs of StaffComrcittee, but on the political side they werewarned.that premature and independent action onour part would probably result in owr being 1 ft
alone and unsupported by other nations.    The cabinet felt that, at this stage at any rate, the greatest importance roust be attached to a policy of bringing about international solidarity.The Cabinet agreed  (a)  To approve the immediate despatchof the following.telegrams:-te Appendices111 p9 cireu-Isted later.(b)ToToToToToPekingParisWashingtonRomeTokyo(Appendix I)Nos. 235No . 77 .No.158 .No. 95.No. 73the effect of which is to concur in identical representations bythe Powers concerned toNationalist Government,the Chinese, on the lines proposed by their Ministers at Peking,subject to -(i)  In order to avoid humiliatingGeneral Chiang Kai-shek, who,according to latest reports,was becoming more friendly,the demands should be madeto the Nationalist government at Hankow,  a copy being givento the General by the Consularauthorities at Shanghai:(ii)  The acceptance being on theunderstanding that the other powers concerned would take their share in sanctions,allowance being made for time for the Japanese Gov-ernment to extricate their nationals, which they were asked to  do without delay:(iii) The   Jlans for sanctions beingremitted to the Admiralscommanding the Fleets of thePowers in China.A-o 2.2,5 to FakingThat the above telegrans/ should be repeated to the Naval Commander-in-Chief.

(H).STATE.Your telegrams Nos. 599 and 605.I understand that the five Ministers at Pekinghave now agreed to recommend to their respective- governments that the -following action should be taken in regardto the Nanking affair.A. To take matter up at once with Chiang Kai-shekthrough their Consuls-General at Shanghai and present to him the following terms:-1.      Adequate punishment of commanders of troopsresponsible for murders, personal injuries and indignitiesand material damage done;      as also of all personsfound to be implicated.2.      Apology in writing by Commander-in-Chief of nationalist army including an express written undertaking to refrain from all forms oi violence and agitation againstforeign lives and property.3.      Complete reparation for personal injuries andmaterial damage done.B. Simultaneously to inform Chiang Kai-shekthrough the Consuls-General that unless he demonstratesto our satisfaction   his intention to comply promptlywith these terms the interested Powers will find them-selves compelled to take such measures as they consider appropriate.It was also unanimously agreed concurrently to
make an identic communication to Chen in the following terms&quot;On the instructions  of the...0............Government1, I am directed by the.....................Minister to present to you the  following terms  (whichare also being addressed to General Chiang Kai-shek,Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist armies) for promptsettlement of the situation created by outrages against..........subjects committed by Nationalist troops at nanking on March 24th last (here insert terms A and B)&quot;.His Majesty&apos;s Government, are for their part readyto agree to these recommendations subject to the two following provisos.1.      They fully appreciate the  force of the view ex-pressed by the Japanese government that as there is reason for believing that. Chiang Kai-shek is now en-endeavouring to form a nucleus of moderate elementsdirected against the extremist factions of the National-ist government, which may constitute the  one&apos; hope for china&apos;s future,  it -. ould be contrary to the interestsof the Powers to humiliate him unduly at the presentmoment.      His Majesty&apos;s Government strongly recommendtherefore that the   above demands be in the first placepresented to Mr. Chen as representing the nationalist government who must be Mdresponsible for these out-rages, and that a copy of the demands be communicated toChiang Kai-shek by the Consular officers at Shanghai.2.     In agreeing to the omission of a time-limit informula B - as quote; above, His Majesty&apos;s Government.\o bo on the understanding that the other Powers accept in principle the application of sanctions in the event
of the Nationalist government, refusing to give satis-faction to their demands.His Majesty&apos;s Government further fully realise thedifficulties in which the Japanese and other governmentsmuy be placed in regard to the question of evacuatingtheir nationals before any action is taken for theapplication of sanctions.      They are quite prepared toallow ample time  for complete evacuation and for such other measures as may tie necessary for the purpose of safeguarding lives and vital interests of other Powers.They earnestly hope, however,  that instructions will immediately be issued,  if this &quot;has not already been done for carrying out evacuation and other similar measureswith all despatch.As regards the question of the  sanctions to beapplied these should in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentform the subject of immediate discussion among tha fivepouers.      They would suggest that this can best and meatoivpe-.i i tiously be   done by uut orising the naval authorities .of the powers in China to formulate an agreed plan of action,if necessary by progressive steps, for the acceptance oftheir governments.I am instructing His Majesty&apos;3 Ambassadors at ParisViashington, Home and Tokyo to.   .maKe a communication inthe above sense at once to the four governments.Repeat to Shanghai, Canton for Hongkong.Repeated to Washington    -To. 157, Rome No. 94.Tokyo No. 7  and Paris  (by bag) Ho. 76.

APPENDIX II.SECRET. Copy No.Hho C.LD. P*Ver No- 787-Bl&apos;   cmd CP. 115 (27).)committee of imperial defence.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE SITUATION IN CHINA, APRIL 4, 1927.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.SINCE the Meeting of the Cabinet at which we Were present on the 1st April welave met twice to consider further the question of reprisals in the contingency of theNationalist Government refusing satisfaction for the outrages at Nanking. At our request the Chief of the Naval Staff has exchanged several telegrams with the naval commander-in-Chief, and the latter has been in communication with the American,Japanese and French Naval Commanders-in-Chief on the China Station. At a meetingkid this morning we felt that we now had sufficient information to enable us to makedefinite proposals to the Cabinet.2. The views of the British, American, Japanese and French Commanders-in-Chief in regard to the enforcement of an ultimatum are contained in the naval commander-in-Chief&apos;s telegram No. 940, dated the 3rd April (Appendix I), and areanalysed in the Table attached to this Report (Appendix II). From this it will beseen that the Naval Commanders-in-Uhief are substantially in agreement in regard tothe measures of reprisal open to them, though they differ as to the order of importance.If, however, we omit those forms of reprisal, to which one or other nation aloneattaches importance (e.g., the American Admiral would like to seize the customs revenue at Shanghai, which the British Admiral rejects altogether, and the french admiral attaches special importance to a blockade and seizure of Chinese shipping, onwhich the others express no view) it will be found that the views coincide on thefollowing as the most suitable forms of reprisal: (a.) The seizure and destruction of the Wusung forts.(b.) The bombardment of the Yangtse forts.(c.) The destruction of the arsenals at Hankow and Canton, but not at Shanghai,owing to the risk to civilians and the danger to adjacent Americanbuildings.(d.) The seizure or destruction of the Cantonese fleet.3. We concur in the above views of the Naval Commanders-in-Chief in China,and we recommend that the forms of reprisal which they suggest should be adoptedby His Majesty&apos;s Government as the basis of the sanctions to an ultimatum.4. In making this recommendation we do not put aside our previous proposalsj1 favour of interrupting military traffic along and across the Yangtse, and of ahlockade.5. As regards the interruption of cross-river traffic, the Commander-in-Chiefconfirms the opinion expressed to the Cabinet on our behalf on the 1st April by theChief of the Naval Staff that at Nanking, where there are guns mounted to command[15987] -    &apos;   B
the river, the interruption of the passage of troops cannot be ensured until the s\have been dealt with ; and we now learn that a 10-inch or 12-inch gun is blinmounted there.   The Commander-in-Chief also makes it clear that the interruption of the passage of the river is also impracticable at Chinkiang until the forts have beedealt with.   It is clear also that considerable Cantonese forces have already crossed the Yangtse and that we are too late to obtain the maximum results from this form ofreprisal.   Nevertheless, even now the cutting of the cross-river communications of theNationalist armies might have some influence in averting a repetition at Peking andTientsin of the outrageous incidents that occurred at Nanking and elsewhere, and wethink it ought not to be definitely discarded for use when the situation has been cleavedup as regards the forts.6. We do not overlook that the British and United States Naval Commanders-in-Chief consider that a stoppage of troop movements involves taking sides in the Chinesewar. On the political side of this observation we express no opinion, but from amilitary point of view we think that the Powers would be justified in any action on the Yangtse which would help to avert a catastrophe at Peking and Tientsin, as well as toprevent the domination of the comparatively friendly forces in North China by theviolently anti-foreign elements in South China.7. The Naval Commander-in-Chief states that it is practicable for him to stopmilitary movements Tip and down the Yangtse, but not across that river, owing tothe length to be patrolled. We assume, however, that at important strategic points,where railways, important roads, or canals cross the Yangtse, effective control couldbe exercised once the forts had been disposed of. We therefore recommend that this measure, as well as the cutting of railways at points where they are accessible from theriver, should be reserved for consideration when it is seen whether the measures proposed by the Naval Commanders-in-Chief effect their purpose.8. Similarly, we recommend that the question of a blockade should be reservedfor later consideration. In this recommendation we note that our views are shared bySir Miles Lampson, the British Minister at Peking, who, in telegram No. 605 of the2nd April, suggests that the idea of a blockade should be kept in the background for production later, if agreement on the original proposals is not forthcoming.9. The measures proposed by the Naval Commanders-in-Chief are, in themselves,acts of war, and once they have been committed we think there might be less reluctancethan at present to follow them up by other steps necessary to produce the desiredresults.10. The Naval Commander-in-Chief appears satisfied as to the capacity of theallied forces to deal by bombardment with the forts at Wusung and on the Yangtse,the latter being tackled one at a time, and in reply to a question as to whether hecould maintain naval forces in the Yangtse, up to and including Hankow, AdmiralTyrwhitt replies, &quot; Yes, certainly.&quot; It is clear, however, that every day&apos;s delay gives the Chinese Nationalists a better chance of getting the defences into shape. That theyare alive to the importance of this is shown by the haste with which they have mounteda 10 or 12-inch gun at Nanking. We hope, therefore, that there will be no long delaybetween the refusal by the Cantonese to give satisfaction to any ultimatum which maybe delivered to them and the enforcement of sanctions.11. With a view to enabling the Commander-in-Chief to judge as to the extentto which the forts both at Wusung and on the Yangtse are capable of resistance,and generally in order to put him in possession of all possible information of military importance, we recommend that Admiral Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt should be given authority to use his aircraft for naval or military purposes, not merely at Shanghai,but anywhere in China within the range of their flight. We suggest also that themilitary importance of this should be communicated to the British Minister at Pekingand the Consul-General at Shanghai.12. One difficulty involving delay in putting sanctions into operation is theexistence of British and other foreign communities in the interior of China. &quot;elearn that by the morning of Sunday, the 3rd April, the evacuation of the river abovfHankow had been effected as far as Ichang, and that all gunboats (includingH.M.S. &quot; Mantis,&quot; in regard to which we were apprehensive) have been brought beloffthe gorges. Evacuation to Hankow will have been completed almost at once, w&apos;uthe possible exception of H.M.S. &quot; Woodcock &quot; at Chansha.
13. We are not precisely informed as to the numbers of British nationals on the Yangtse at and below Hankow, though we understand that the number is small. their withdrawal, however, after belligerent operations had been undertaken lower downdie i&apos;iver niight involve&apos; considerable risk. If the aids to navigation had been withdrawn, the passage of the river past the forts by night might be impossible, and[hepassage by day might involve casualties.1-1. In view of the uncertainties of the situation, we recommend the withdrawaljot all British nationals from the Yangtse, and we suggest that other countries likelyIto be concerned in sanctions should be urged to order a similar withdrawal.15. Military intelligence is to the effect that the Chinese Commander-in-Chief,General Chiang Kai-shek, is at variance with the Cantonese Government now established at Hankow. We do not wish to interfere in a political matter, but froma military point of view there appeared to us to be certain advantages in making any demand in regard to Nanking to the Nationalist Government rather than to theitary Commander-in-Chief.16.   Tientsin. In this survey of the situation in China as a whole we haveInecessarily to consider the situation at Peking and Tientsin, and we have taken note(of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No. 591, dated the 1st April, in which he suggestshat reinforcements amounting to one brigade would be necessary for the defence ofI Tientsin.17. We have frequently urged in previous Reports that in existing circumstancesreliance must be placed on Japan for protection of British and international interestsnorth of the River Yangtse. If it should now be decided that such a procedure is impracticable, and that the defence of the concessions at-Tientsin is to be a Britishcommitment, a close re-examination of the whole military situation in China will benecessary.18. Before dealing, therefore, with the suggestions contained in Sir miles lampson&apos;s telegram, referred to above, we feel that further guidance is necessary as tothe policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to safeguarding British interestsin the North.19. We are informed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that for theprotection of the international concessions at Tientsin the existing inter-allied forces would have to he reinforced by at least one mixed Brigade. This estimate does not take into account forces necessary for maintaining communications (over 30 miles long)to the sea, or for the protection of &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Peking.kmmanj of Conclusions and Recommendations.20. (a.) We concur in the following sanctions proposed by the NavalCommanders-in-Chief in China of the British, American, Japanese and French Fleets,and recommend their adoption as the basis, of the sanctions to an ultimatum :  .&apos;(i.) The seizure and destruction of the Wusung forts,(ii.) The bombardment of the Yangtse forts.(iii.) The destruction of the arsenals at Hankow and Canton but not Shanghai,(w.) The seizure or destruction of the Cantonese fleet.(b.) In case the above sanctions do not produce the necessary result, the following measures of reprisal should be kept in reserve for the present:  .t(I.) The interdiction to the Cantonese of the passage of the Yangtse. . aa-ii(ii.) Blockade.(c) In order not to give longer than absolutely necessary to the Cantonese tocomplete their measures at the forts and elsewhere to enable them to impede theMovement of British and foreign ships on the Y&quot;angtse, there should be as little^lay as possible between a refusal by the Cantonese to give satisfaction or their non-compliance with an ultimatum and the enforcement of sanctions.(d.) The Naval Commander-in-Chief should be given authority to use his aircrafttor Naval and Military purposes not merely at Shanghai, but to reconnoitre the fortsj ou the Yangtse and anywhere in China within the range of their flight.-:    -  . .      *ff&apos;.11.59871 B 2
(e.) The 7uilitary importance of recommendation (d) should be impressed on theBritish Minister at Peking and the Cpnsul-General at Shanghai.(/.) In view of the uncertainties of the situation, the immediate withdrawal of all british nationals from the Yangtse is recommended, and we suggest that the othercountries concerned should be urged to order a similar withdrawal.(f/.) From a military point of view there are advantages in making any demand inregard lo Nanking to the Nationalist Government rather than to the Chinese military commander-in-Chief.(h.) We adhere to our previous recommendation that, if possible, reliance shouldbe placed on Japan for the protection of British and international interests North ofthe River Yangtse. If this is impossible we should be glad to have further politicalguidance in regard to the importance which His Majesty&apos;s Government attach to theretention of Peking and Tien-tsin. For the local protection of the internationalconcessions at Tientsin the minimum reinforcement should be one mixed Brigade, butthis does not allow for the maintenance of communications (over 30 miles long) to thesea or for the protection of the Legation at Peking.(Signed) BEATTY.G.
