1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum circulated by the Secretary of Stats for ForeignAffairs in regard to the rights of Eritish subjects in China in Treaty Ports and in Concessions  (paper cp.-15 (27)) .The Secretary of  State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an account of the events in regardto China since the last meeting,   immediately after that meeting a reply had been received from theJapanese Government declining to collaborate in military measures for the defence of Shanghai andrefusing to give any assurance that they wouldprovide the necessary force if the emergency should arise.    In these circumstances, orders had beengiven for the forces approved by the Cabinet toproceed to China in accordance with Cabinet 3 (27) (a.)..Sir Austen Chamberlain then gave the cabinet a full account of a conversation he had had withthe Japanese Ambassador (particulars of which are about to be circulated) and other information bearing on the attitude of Japan.    He mentioned also that atelegram, on the terms of which the Eritish ambassador at Tokyo and the British Minister at Peking had been consulted, had now been sent to Washington, Paris,Rome and oth^r Capitals concerned, explaining theBritish policy.     He informed the Cabinet that Mr.0&apos;Malley would communicate the British policy toEugene Chen on the following day, after which thequestion of what publicity (if any) was desirablewould have to be considered.In regard to the Washington surtaxes, sir austen said that the subject would be discussed onthe following day by the diplomatic body at Peking,
0 oSince the Japanese were unwillinc to agree,  therewould be no joint declaration, but he thought eachPower that shared our view would make its owndeclaration to the Peking Government of its willing-ness to pay these surtaxes.    In the absence,, however,of a joint declaration, the Customs would be unableto &apos;rake the collection.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that he had made fullpersonal explanations to the leaders of the Opposi-*tion, Mr Lloyd George and Mr Ramsay MacDonald.He had undertaken to receive some representativesof the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Partythe same afternoon in order to explain the positionto them.A discussion then took place on the various aspects of Eritish policy in China.    There was general agreement that, in view of the fact thatthe Peking Government was represented at geneva and that the Cantonese Government was unrecognisedby the Powers, it would be useless, and probablyembarrassing to the Council, to make any appeal tothe League under the terms of the Covenant.    It wassuggested, however, that, in order to inform theworld of our true attitude, and to make clear thatthe forces despatched to China were for defensive purposes only and not, in pursuance of any aggressivedesign, a full statement of our policy ought to bemade to the League of Nations.After full consideration, the Cabinet agreed

(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should prepare a document setting forth our policyin China in clear terms, and thatthe Cabinet should then consider what was the best method of com-communicating it to the public opinionof this country and the world, e,g.,by a statement to the League ofNations or by some other method ofpublic ity:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should ascertain the views of the British Ministerat Peking and the Consul-general at Shanghai as to what, in theiropinion, should be done on the arrival or approach of the troops now under orders in various alternative contingencies, e,g.,no change in the present situation,either from the military point ofview or that of public order:or, opposition by Sun Chuan Fangto the landing of the troops at shangai: and what the relations were to be between the forces andthe Municipality of Shanghai, whichis international:(c) That the Secretary of State for war should make detailed enquiries as towhat accommodation could be madeavailable at Hong-Kong, Singapore,or other British&quot;ports in the East,in case events should render itdesirable to disembark any of theforoes now under orders for Shanghaibefore their arrival there:(d) That the Secretary of State for war should have authority to allow thetransport containing a Battalion ofthe Suffolk Regiment from Gibraltarto proceed direct to Shanghai, inorder that the Indian Battalionalready sent there might be balancedby a British Battalion:(e) That the First Lord of the admiralty should ascertain whether it would notbe possible for corcimunioation by wireless telegraphy to be established between Mr 0&apos;Mailey at Hankow andthe British Minister at Peking by wireless telegraphy from a british ship in the Yangtse, since at timessuch messages appear to be transmitted by American wireless by the courtesyof the American representatives.

HOUSF OP LORDSOP.M.(PreviousBBferenca:Cabinet 64(86), Con-clue ion 2 .)6.    A short discussion took place in regard to house of Lords Reform.The suggestion was made that, even thoughit might be impossible to bring the matter beforethe House of Commons in the forthcoming Session,a preliminary discussion might be useful in theHouse of Lords during the period when that house is waiting for Bills to come up from the House- ofCommons;    in this event the subject might perhaps be mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech.The Prime Minister suggested that the question should be brought up in the following week when theKingrs Speech was before the Cabinet, and, ifnecessary, a special Cabinet Meeting might be held for its consideration.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W..1,/January 26, 1927.
