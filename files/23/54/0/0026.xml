elusion 2.)round .The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe Committee of Chiefs of Staff was anxious thatthis Report should be considered as soon as possi-ble,  the point at issue being as to whether theNaval Commander-in-Chief was to be prepared to act alone in the matter of sanctions for the Nankingoutrages in the event of America and Japan refusing to co-operate,  and, if so, on whose instructions hewas to act.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn toSir Miles Lamps on&apos;s telegram No. 659, dated April11th,  suggesting that a simple affirmative replyought to be insisted on at the latest within 72hours from the date of delivery of the demands ofthe Powers.    The Cabinet were reminded that 24hours had already elapsed, while the Commander-in-Chief required 72 hours to make the necessarydispositions for enforcing sanctions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsadvised the Cabinet that at the moment no decisionought to be taken for this country to act alone inthe matter of sanctions.    The United States ofAmerica had not yet acquiesced in the principle of sanctions, and Japan would only co-operate insanctions which her Government regarded as effective,and they were; not satisfied with the particularsanctions proposed, by the Naval Commanders-in-Chiefof the Powers in China.    At the present moment alsothe Northerners were advancing to the Yangtse,IICHINA. 1. At the outset of the Meeting, copies of aReport by the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, onf Previous . ,Reference: the Situation in China with specxal reference tor1ab1 net 2527)&apos;, Con- the Yangtse ^Paper CP.-123 (27)), were handed
and it was unoertain that, in taking the sanctionsproposed by the Naval Comrrander*-in-Chief, we shouldnot be hitting the Northern Chdnese instead of theCantonese.    In the circumstances, Sir austen chamberlain suggested that the decision should be deferred until the following day, interim repliesin the meanwhile being sent to Sir Miles Lamps on and the Naval Commander-in-Chief.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsalso asked the First Lord of the Admiralty to invitethe attention of the First Sea Lord to the consider-able dispersion of force involved in the naval commander-in-Chief*s proposed dispositions.    Heemphasized the importance of there being no risk of failure in any operation that might be undertaken,and wished to be assured that the Chiefs of staff were satisfied in this respect.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone consideration of thequestions raised in the Report ofthe Committee of Chiefs of Staff(Paper C.P.-123 (27)) until the s.following day:(b) That the First Lord of the admiralty should send a telegram to the naval commander-in-Chief to the effect thatno action should be taken to enforcesanctions without further ins true-tions, but that in the meantime heshould keep a careful watch on the movements of the Chinese in case they might be making any preparationswhich would defeat his plans:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should instruct sir Miles Lampson that no isolatedaction, either in fixing the date forthe receipt of the reply of theCantonese to the demands of thePowers or in applying sanctions,must be taken without directauthority from His Majesty&apos;a Govern-roent,,&apos;and that he hoped to be in aposition to communicate more fullyon the following day:
(d)  That the protection of british nationals at Chefoo (which was raised hy a member of the Cabinet)was a matter on which, the british minister at Peiing and the naval commander-in-Chief had full authority, and with which theywere best situated to deal.
2. The Cabinet took.note that, the Prime minister agreed that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have authority, in cases of emergency(as, for example, in the present situation inChina), to refer questions direct to the Committeeof Chiefs of Staff.
