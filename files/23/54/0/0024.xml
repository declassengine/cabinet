trrjA. 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that immediately after theirpreviousdeference: previous Meeting he had sent the telegrams thenCabinet s3(27), Con- approved to Peking, Tokyo, Washington, Paris andlusion 1.)Rome, but that as yet he had received no reply.Sir Austen Chamberlain recalled that at theprevious Meeting he had undertaken to see LordCrewe, who is now on a visit to England,  in regardto the somewhat lukewarm attitude of the FrenchGovernment towards our policy in China.    Owing tothe Debate in the House of Commons  that afternoonhe himself was unable to see Lord Crewe,  but insteadhe had written him a private note (the matter notbeing one suitable for an official representation)in which he had rehearsed the evidence to show thatthe French Government were taking advantage of our efforts and of the protection of our forces, but were almost openly dissociating themselves from our policy, which, as he had pointed out, was a poorreturn for all the support we had given to france in the Locarno policy and otherwise.The Secretary of State also informed theCabinet of the general line he proposed to take inthe Debate on China in the House of Commons that afternoon.
elusion 2.)EGYPT.. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum h,strength the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on theif thetoyptian Array,       subject of the Strength of the Egyptian Army(Paper CP.-114 (27)).previous reference: The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsCabinet 19(25), Con- informed the Cabinet that he had the same morningreceived a personal letter from, Lord Lloyd, fromwhich it was clear that an official despatch was due by the same mail.    In the circumstances, andmore particularly in view of the fact that theMemorandum (Paper CP.-114 (27)) had only been circulated two days before, he had. asked thePrime Minister to withdraw the question from theAgenda.Sir Austen Chamberlain undertook to circulate Lord lloyd newdespatch on the subject.-2-
3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked foran alteration of the Cabinet decision referred toin the margin so far as it related to Death Duties..On examining the question he had come to the con-clusion that if he made some concession in regardto the evasion of Death Duties which would benefit the land-owning classes, he would have to give somecorresponding concession to other classes of tax-payer.    It was undesirable to make such concessions in the present financial position.   Moreover, hehad found that, whereas the provisions relating toSuper-Tax and Income Tax avoidance could not inany case come into operation until 19S8, theprovisions affecting Death Duties would operate inthe present financial year if introduced in theBill.    In the circumstances  (more particularly asthe yield of this Tax had exceeded the estimateand the evasion was therefore probably not on alarge scale)  the provisions affecting Death Dutiesmiglit, he thought, be postponed for a year.    he proposed so to inform the House of Commons and totell them at the same time that he intended toexamine the basis of liability of agricultural land to Estate Duty, with a view to rectifying anyinjustice or anomaly in the charge.The Cabinet approved the above proposal.
4. The ,Cabinet resumed their discussion in regardto Houso of Lords Reform.-    In addition to theReports of the Cabinet Committee (Papers CJ.P. 27 (26)and C.P. 86 (27))and Memoranda by the Lord privy seal  (Papers CP.  105 (26) and CP. 26 (27)) whichhad been before them at their previous Meeting, theyhad under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs  (Paper CP.  118 (27)).After considerable discussion,  the cabinet agreed -(a) That the Cabinet Committee should be askedto meet-again with a view to drawing, up, asa basis for consideration,  further resolu-tions on the following lines(i) Resolution (1) in the Appendix to paper cp. 86 (27) in regard to a JointStanding Committee of the two houses of Parliament on the question ofYriiether a Bill is or is not a MoneyBill:(ii) Resolution (2) in the Appendix to paper CP. 86  (27) to the effect thatBills dealing with local rates shouldnot be leemed Money Bills, and theHouse of Lords should have power todeal with them:(ill) A new Resolution designed to preventthe Parliament Act being altered bymeans of the application of the provisionsof the Parliament Act itself:(iv) A Resolution relating to the reductionof the number of hereditary Peers,   (ifpossible at the instigation of the Peersthemselves), and the creatio i of some form of non-hereditary members of thesecond chamber, perferably for a termof years or the life of a Parliament,rather than for life.(b) That&quot; the Cabinet Committee should also consider the question of the application ofResolution (iii) above to any Billauthorising a change of the law by Regula-tion or Order in Council, and to any Billeffecting an alteration of the constitution.
5.   The Cabinet had before thera a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (Paper CP.-116 (37))  covering the Report of the Crown Proceedings Committee,which was appointed in 1921 to consider theposition of the Crown as a litigant, the Terms ofReference to which were modified by the LordChancellor (Lord Haldane)  in 1924 by a request tothe Committee to prepare a Bill on the assumptionthat certain alterations in law were both desirable and feasible.    The only question raised in theLord ChancellorTs&quot;Memorandum was as to publicationthe Report.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Report of the Crown Proceed-ings Committee should be published:(b) That before it is published the LordChancellor should arrange to answera Question in the House of Lords tothe effect that the Government heldthemselves perfectly free in regardto the Report, )(c) That in due course the Prime minister should appoint a Cabinet Committeeto consider the question.
