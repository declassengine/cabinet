The Cabinet had before them the followlnofffTLEKENT.documents relating to certain outstanding(Previous disputes between the British and Indian GovernReference!Cabinet 46 merits and between the War Office and the India(21), Oon-ciusion2.) Office:-A Joint Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War(who had acted also on behalfof the Minister of Pensions)and the Secretary of State forIndia, submitting a basis of settlement the effect  of whichwas that no further payments would be made by either side to the other in respect of thematters covered (Paper C.P.-69  (27)):A Memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (Paper CP.-70(27)) asking the Cabinet todecide that the outstanding issues should be settled by arbitration so far as BritishDepartments are concerned, butnot suggesting that any measureof compulsion should be appliedto the Indian Parliament if theyrepudiate the result of the Award,assuming that it is unfavoxurabreto them:A further Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India(Paper C.P.-74 (27)) in which he urged the  Cabinet to leave intactthe agreement he had reached withthe Secretary of State for War,but expressed his willingness,if so required, to consult theViceroy as to the choice betweenarbitration with the previousassent of the Government of Indiaand the Legislative assembly and arbitration without previousconsent, but equally withoutobligation to abide by the result.He held out no hope, however, thatarbitration in any form would leadto a solution of the question, inview of the Constitutional andother difficulties involved.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was&apos; prepared,to put the questions at issue to arbitration;    toallow the Secretary of State for India to nominatethe Arbitrator;    and to agree beforehand to abide by the Arbitrator&apos;s decision.In view of the   Constitutional difficulties,as explained in his Memorandum,  the Secretary ofState for India was unable to accept this proposal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, wasnot prepared to waive the claims on the indian government, of the British taxpayer.The suggestion was made, but not acceptedby the Secretary of State for India, that if some machinery could be devised for the settlement of future disputes of the same order (of which,  theCabinet were informed,  there were several at thepresent time between the War Office and the IndiaOffice)  the British Government might adopt a generous attitude in the case of the war claims.A deadlock having been reached, the cabinet agreed  That for the present the claimsshould remain unsettled.
3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made thefollowing offer to the Secretary of State forIndia:-That the British Exchequer shouldhe responsible for the whole costof transport and maintenance of theBritish Battalions of the IndianMixed Brigade with the ShanghaiExpeditionary Force, as well as thewhole cost of the remainder of the mixed Brigade over and above whatIndia would have paid if the troops had remained in India, the cost tothe Indian Government being there-fore limited to that of the IndianMixed Brigade if in India, less thatof the two British Battalxons.The Secretary of State for India was unableto accept this offer, owing partly to Gonstitu-tional difficulties, partly to the smallnessof the Indian interests in China,  and generally to the equities of the case.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, while recognising that thematter was one in which the finaldecision must remain with india., the Council ofIndia and the Indian government ought to be informed of the Cabinet!sstrong view that as a matter of equity the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s proposal was the leastshare, of the cost which India oughtto bear:(b) That the Secretary of State forIndia should inform the Councilof India and the Indian Government   -of the Cabinet&apos;s view: in such manner as he might deem appropriate.Expensesof the Indiannxad Brigadeo( the ShanghaiE3?3rce Force.(previous reference:Cabinet 14(27), Con-conclusion o0j.
