I. The Cabinet further considered their policyin the light of recent developments.On the question of British troop movements the&apos; Cabinet were infoxmed that, according to informa-tion received by the Admiralty from the NavalOormander-in-Chief, two British Battalions of theIndian Mixed Brigade had left Hong-Kong for Shanghai,and that the transports carrying the rest of the brigade had been ordered to proceed to Shanghaidirect.    The various units of the Indian MixedBrigade were due to arrive -at Shanghai betweenFebruary 12th and 21st.    In this connection attentionx,a,s drawn to a tele pram.&apos; from the rfeval C oxuaand e r-in-&apos; Chief j China Station, for-, arded to Sir Miles Lamps on by tas Consul-General, Shanghai (Shanghai telegramNo. 41 of February 9th) stating, iia reply to Mr0&apos;Malley&apos;s request for information (see Pekingtelegram No.45), that one Brigade and one Regiment(sic) was the ndnimum requirement for reinforcements;that the troops would be quartered inside the shanghai settlement and only moved outside fortactical purposes;    and that the present arrangementis&apos; that the reiuaining two Brigades of the ShanghaiDefence Force should be called up from Fong-Kdng as circumstances require.Jn regard to the military situation in china the information before the Cabinet was to the effectthat,in recent fighting with the Cantonese army,Sun -&apos;0huan-fang1 s army covering Shanghai had probably,on balance, suffered a reverse (Shanghai telegramNo. 42, Peking telegrams Nos. 272 -and 275). attention was called to the eastward movements oi russian soviet troops (Peking telegram No-271).   &apos;
On the political side generally the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs gave the Cabinet asummary of a long- statement he had only just receivedf 10m the French Government, couched in friendly-terms , but indicating that in their view combinedaction by the Powers was improbable, that they themselves were only prepared to defend their con-cession at Shanghai against mob violence and not against Chinese troops, and suggesting; that the good offices of the League of Nations should &quot;be soughtwith a view-to a settlement with the Cantonese.From Japan information was received tending to showthat the trouble with Great Britain had broughtWorth and South China appreciably closer (Tokyo Tele-gra?u No.  70).From Hankow Mr 0&apos;Mailey reported (Hankowtelegram No.46) that agreement had been reached inregard to the Hankow and Kiukiang concessions,subject to mutual assurances by Eugene Chen againstthe use of force against concessions, but notcovering boycotts , etc.   (For text see Peking telegram;ramHo.48), and by Mr O1Mailey in regard to the landing of British reinforcements at Shanghai (For text seePeking t alegram No.49).Thcsra was general agreement that theagreements and assurances    oouia be accepted, andthe Cabinet then proceeded to consider whether theNavel Coimander-in-Chiei should be instructed, in theevent of the signature of these agreements andassurances, to re-examine his decision to bring thewhole of the Indian Mixed Brigade on to Shangnai.During this discussion the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs received and read out Sir MilesLamp son1 s telegram No. 275 of February 10th, pointing
out that the approach to Shanghai of the defence force was bringing some members of the CantonGovernment to their senses, endorsing the decisionof the Naval Compander-in-Chief to bring the IndianBrigade forthwith to Shanghai;    and reporting thatSun Chuan-fang; s position was unstable.    this telegram was felt to render unnecessary any further telegram to the Naval Commander-in-Chief in regardto the Shanghai Defence Force.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should authorise .Mr O1Mailey to accept Chen&apos;s writtenassurance for the future and to sign the Hankow and Eiukiang concessionagreements, including the writtenassurance by Mr O1Mailey to theeffect that x-he British authorities concerned will do all in their powerto implement and secure the successful operation of the agreements, and thatChinese citizens should enjoy- equal rights with British subjects in these &quot;ar:as (See Mr G^Malley^telegram No.47).    As regards the shanghai Defence Force Mr O1Maileyshould be told to make clear thatthe troops were to be used only for protection and in sufficient numbers tosecure this;    that the troops would. be stationed within the settlement and would not be moved outside exceptin case of grave emergency;    ana thatHis Majesty^s Government will continueto maintain strict neutrality in thecivil war in China (For details seeAppendix):(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should inform the House ofCommons of the present position inthe negotiations and of the tenorof the &quot;reply summarised in (a).    Heshould also inform the House that theNaval Commander-in-Chief had deemed itI   necessary to bring the Indian Mixed/   Brigade to Shanghai, but. that thereminder of the Shanghai defence force would be concentrated uponHong-Kong:(c) That the Secretary of State for war should be authorised to take upaccommodation at Hong-Kong for theBritish Brigades from home and fromthe Mediterranean, which could onlycamp in the open until about March 15th:
That the Secretary of State for War-should base his arrangements on theassumption that no use can he madeof Wei-hai-v.&apos;3i for hospital or othermilita ry purpose s:To take note that (so far as thishas not already been done) theSecretary of State for War willinstruct the General Officer appointedto command the Shanghai Defence Force,on his arrival at Shanghai, to consider carefully all measures&apos;for the organisa-tion of an adequate Intelligence service,including, ii he deems feasible and^desirable, the attachment of attacheswith the forces of various Chinesearmies:To take note -That the Secretary of State for warand the First Lord&quot; of the Admiraltywill circulate copies of all Servicetelegrams to and from China whichare likely to be useful to the Cabinetduring the present crisis in China;alsoThat the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs will arrange forimmediate copies of telegrams toand from China to be circulated tothe Cabinet during tie present crisiswithout the delay involved In printing:That in the public interest the PrimeMinister should refuse information inthe House of Commons regarding thenumber of troops and other armedBritish forces at present at Shanghaiavailable for the defence of the inter-national settlement (Mr Lansbury&apos;sstarred Question No. 47, February 10th).That in regard to the French proposalto invoke the good offices of theLeague of Nations, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs shouldhave authority, if he deems desirable,to reply by explaining the reasons which have led Bis Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to the conclusion that theassistance of the League in thesettlement of the difficulties inChina cannot be sought at present,but to express 2^-willingness ^e-Of^^^BB^^i the-H&apos;l^%%e-a^the^^h^-4^e-se
2. The Cabinet had before them Memoranda bythe Secretary of State for Scotland (Paper CP.-34(27)) and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper C P.-44 (27)) in regard to the situationwhich has arisen in consequence of the Court of session having pronounced the poor relief duringthe Strike to miners1 dependants in Scotland to beillegal.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To recognise that the position ofParish Councils in Scotland is different from that of Boards of guardians in England, both in the respect that it &quot;was illegal forthem to incur the expenditure andalso that it would not be practicableby retrospective legislation togive them the power&quot;of Boards of guardians, which in many cases wasexercised, of giving relief on loan:. and to meet that differenceby giving; a grant from the Exchequertowards defraying 40 per cent, ofthe expenditure, leaving the rate-payers to bear the remainder:(b) That the necessary legislation tomake it lawful for the parish councils to impose a rate for their share of the expenditure should beintroduced by the Secretary ofState for Scotland:(c) That in introducing&quot; the above legis-lation the Secretary of State forScotland should give an undertaking to the effect that an opportunitywould be taken of passing legisla-tion assimilating the position inEngland and Scotland for the future.
