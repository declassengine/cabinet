CHINA i1.  On the suggestion of the Secretary of StateWeekly for Foreign Affairs, the Cabinet agreed  Summaryfurnished That, in view of the vary fullby the information circulated daily by foreign &apos;       the Secretary of State forOffice. Foreign Affairs in the form of telegrams, despatches, etc., inregard to events in China, it was unnecessary, from the point ofview of the Cabinet, that theappropriate department of theForeign Office which is very fully occupied at the presenttime)  sho\ild be burdened withthe work of continuing the weekly summary on China.
2.    The Cabinet had &quot;before them the following documents in regard to the present situation inChinat-A Memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (Paper CP.-5 (27)):A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence (Paper C.P.-4 (27)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a statement to the Cabinet on the recent events in China, and more particularly in regardto the manoeuvres by which the nationalist government of South China had obtained possessionof the British Concession at Hankow, a contingencywhich there had been no reason to anticipate whenthe Cabinet last me&apos;t.    At first the withdrawal ofthe naval forces from the Hankow Concession had given the impression of a grave blunder.    Latercommunications, however, and more especially thosof the Rear-Admiral,  indicated that the actionof the Rear-Admiral and the Consul had averted agreat disaster.    The mob at Hankow (probablyincited by the Nationalists) had been so violentas to be controllable only by the use of firearmsBut the military forces of the South ChinaNationalist Government were at hand, and it was probable that, if fire had been opened, theywould have joined the mob, with incalculableconsequences.    Referring to the view of theChiefs of Staff, that Japan was the only country which could act in time to ensure the safety ofShanghai against an attack by the ChineseNationalist forces (if the latter should undertake it), the Secretary of State pointedout. that up to now such indications as he had
of the attitude of the Japanese Government went toshow that they were disinclined to take the leadin any way in China, and were perhaps not ill-pleased at seeing the boycott, from which they themselves had suffered in the past, transferredto the British.    He read telegram No.7, from Tokyo,dated January 11th, indicating a possible changeof attitude.    The Japanese General Staff, but4gpHpNM$p without the knowledge of the TokyoForeign Office, was reported as anxious to enterinto mili-tary conversations with the British GeneralStaff with a view to concerting plans for the defenseof Shanghai.    This would enable him to instruct the Ambassador at Tokyo to ascertain whether theForeign Minister shared the view of the JapaneseGeneral :S..taff, and, in the event of an affirmativereply, the two Staffs could be put in contact.Sir Austen Chamberlain then read telegram No.14from Hankow, indicating that the Japanese Consul-General was working with us there, but that theUnited States representatives, probably under instructions from Washington, had become aloof;also a telegram (No.15)  reporting the evacuation of women ard children from Chang-sha and Chung-King.He made it clear that Mr 0&apos;Malley&apos;s mission toHankow (where he had arrived on the previous day)had the object of ascertaining the precise position there, and that he would report his conclusions and recormendajb&amp;ans to Sir Miles Lamps$heBritish Minister at Peking, who would repast to theForeign Office.    A gocw  deal appeared to tjfrnupon whether Eugene Ch**n was- -free to negotiate or-Si
whefher ia;wa&amp; dominated by - the Bolshevist elementand the Russian agent Borodin.    To assist Sir miles lampson, he proposed to telegraph a summary of theReport of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, as well asthe&apos;full text of their conclusions.In the course of the discussion mention was madeof the fact that the British G-ovemroent, from whomas lessees of the Concessions at Treaty T^prts inChina commercial firms obtained their leases, hadfinancial interests to an amount of about  6,000,000.The question was also considered as to whether mr 0*Malley should--be instructed to refuse tocontinue his conversations with Eugene Chen untilthe British Concession had been restored.(see conclusion (e) .)A good deal of attention was given to the ques-tion of the protection of British interests at shangai in the event of attack.    A suggestion wasmade that Eugene Chen ought to be left under noillusions as to the intention of the Powers concerned to hold Shanghai.The attention of the Chief of the Imperial -G-eneral Staff was invited to the question of whetherthe &quot;local forces at Shanghai were provided with adequate supplies and reserves of firearms, ararauni-tion and other war material of all kinds for seriousoperations of the nature indicated in the Report ofthe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a). That -the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should telegrapha summary of the Report of theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, andthe full text of the conclusions to Sir Miles Lampson, at Peking,for his information:
(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should instruct sir Wiles Lampson to do his utmost to obtain definite undertakingsfror his diplomatic colleagues at peking that their respective governments will take their propershare in sending to Eskdst^l/the ISka^yLiZD      -_reinforcements already arrangedl&amp;A^jj   for atVShanghai (Peking telegrama     Mo.57, dated January 10, 1937),as soon as the local authoritiesconsi^er^necessary   (Telegram No.22(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should instruct       ,the British K iOT3*sr/at Tokyo to  /ffmhmvdo?-enquire whether the Minister forForeign Affairs shared the desire of the Japanese General Staff, asset forth in telegram Mo.7 fromTokyo, for conversations between.   the British and Japanese General Staffs in regard to the situation at Shanghai:(d) That the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff should be ready toadvise the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs as to the ins true-tlons to be sent out for the use ofthe British Military Attache&apos; in theevent of a favourable reply from theJapanese Government:(e) That the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff should have authorityto make prelircinai-y arrangements,including inquiries as to shippingtransport for the movement of a mixed Brigade to Shanghai as quickly as possible:    but that,until theco-operation of other Powers in ascheme of reinforcement had beenobtained, it was of the utmost importance that no hint should bemade public that we were considering any larggnmilitary movement, andthat, ifiynecessary outside inquiriesthe War Office should make everyeffort to secure the preservation of secrecy:(f) That the Trading and Blockade Sub-Cocwittee of the Committee ofImperial defence, of which theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancasteris Chairman, should assemble forthwith,in accordance with the suggestion madeseparately by the Lord President ofthe Council and the Chiefs of StaffSubcommittee, .to report on all thepossibilities of putting economic pressure on the Nationalist Government
of South China, by blockade or byother measures, whether by inter-national action or, in the last resort, by the British alone.   TheChairman was authorised to consultSir Charles Addis, the Chairman ofthe wong-Kong and Shanghai Bank,and was asked&apos;   to   discuss with him,inter alia,  the question of howfar it was feasible and desirableto continue to use the closing ofBritish banks at Hankow as a leverfor securing the return of the concession;(g) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto send the following telegram (whichhe drafted during the meeting to giveeffect to the views of the Cabinet)to Sir Miles Lampson:-&quot;We also should like to insist on return of concession beforeentering on any negotiations.You and Mr 0&apos;Mailey will be thebest Judges whether this ispossible or whether it would lead to immediate breakdown ofthe conversations and complete.breach with the South.   You willbear in mind that forcible re-occupation of the concession isnot a possible operation&quot;.(h) To take note that the Chief of theImperial General Staff would ask theSecretary of State for War to bring before the Committee of ImperialDefence in due course proposals inregard to the recommendation of theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in favourof a strategic military reserve inthe Far Fast:(i) That the Cabinet should hold themselvesin readiness to meet at short noticeduring the next few days if Sir MilesLamp s o n&apos;s reports of Mr 0&apos; Ma 1 ley * sconversations should render a meetingdesirable.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January IS, 1937 .
CHINA192/156/10).Cypher telegram to Mr. Lampson,   (Peking).Foreign Office,  12th January,  1927.    6 p.m.No.  22.Your telegrams Nos.  56 and 57 (of January 10th:defence of Shanghai).Instructions have now been sent authorising theGovernor and the General Office Commanding, HongKong,to send Punjabis immediately to Shanghai without priorreference to War Office on receipt by former of tele-gram from His Majesty&apos;s Consul-general   at Shanghai,requesting their despatch at any time.The question of the defence of Shanghai has beenunder consideration in conjunction v/ith Admiralty,War Office and Air Ministry,  and,  though no final con-clusions have yet been reached,  one point that is quite clear is that it is not intended that the Britishtroops should under any circumstances come into con-conflict with Chinese National Army and very clearinstructions will have to be issued in order to avoid any such eventuality.      In view of the tactics whichwere employed at Hankow and Kiukiang and which, unlesstrouble is averted by negotiation,  may be repeated at shangai, we are anxious that the proposal to employthese troops to form a cordon, projecting at some points beyond the Settlement boundaries,  should be carefully reconsidered in the light of the above decision.      If mob violence is mobilised and theforeign/
foreign troops are compelled to fire on the moboutside the Settlement this would in all probabilitybring them into conflict with the Nationalist army at some stage.      In that event it seems that themajority of the troops holding the cordon would be unable either to defend themselves or to make goodtheir retreat.      Sir S.Barton should therefore consult with his  colleagues and the Settlement authoritieswhether, under the altered circumstances of to-day,a cordon is the wisest method of employing such forces as are available.      Is not this likely inevitably-tably to bring them into collision with Nationalistarmies under conditions which must result indisaster?     Would it not be safer and more effectiveto keep them at central positions within the Settle-ment,  relying mainly upon moral effect of their presence but employing them if necessar?/- and as occasion arises against definite objectives withinthe Settlement?Meanwhile attitude of Japanese and United Statesconsuls-general at Shanghai as described in last paragraph of your telegram No.  57 is characteristicbut wholly unsatisfactory.      While prepared, to sendour quota of one battalion to Shanghai as soon as itis asked for,  the other Powers should be made tounderstand clearly that it is only so sent on theunderstanding that they are agreed to take their share/
share in providing the balance of 4,000 menconsidered, necessary to protect Shanghai, from mobviolence.      It is quite useless for us to take the lead in this matter unless we have an absolute and definite assurance  that the other Powers are doing their share;    and -Japan in particular,  by her geo-graphical position alone,  should b^ rights, be thefirst Power able to send reinforcements at theearliest moment.      You should at once take up thisquestion with your colleagues at Peking and en-deavour to obtain from them definite undertakings,that their governments are doing their proper share in despatching reinforcements,  and report to me asscon as possible what forces they will send and howsoon they can reach Shanghai.Repeat. Shanghai,  Hong Kong,  Tok:/o and Hankowfor Mr.  0&apos;Malley.
InLCHINA.Cypher telegram to Mr.  Lampson.  (Peking).Foreign Office.      January 12th,  1927.      6,30 p.tn.No.  23.Your telegrams Nos.  62 and 63 (of January 10th:situation a t Hankow).We also should like to insist on return of con-cession before entering on any negotiations.      You andMr.  0&apos;Malley will be the best judges whether this ispossible or whether it would lead to imv&quot;ediate break-down of the conversations and complete breach withthe South.      You will bear in mind that forcible re-occupaticn of the concession is not a possible opera-tion.Repeat to Tokyo,   Shanghai,  Canton,  Hong Kong,Hankow for Mr. 0&apos;Maliey.
(F 260/156/10).JAPANCypher telegram to Sir J. Tilley,   (Tokyo).Foreign Office,   10 p.m.  12th January,   1927.No.  4.Your telegram No.7 (of January 10-.l.You should at once enquire of the Japanese Ministerfor Foreign Affairs whether Japanese government shareviews of Japanese  General Staff as communicated to military Attache.2.If they reply in affirmative you should say thatwe will at once give necessary instructions to our military Attache,  and we presume that Japanese governmentwould similarly instruct their Attache here.3.You  should  also suggest that immediate ins t ru ct ionsbe sent to Japanese Minister at Peking to concert withHis Majesty&apos;s Minister there as to the practical steps which can be taken for putting into effect their proposalsfor combined action.      On learning that Japanese governmentare agreeable,  I will instruct Sir M.  Lampson to discussthe whole question with his Japanese colleague and to join with him in urging the other diplomatic representativesof the interested Powers in Peking to combine with themin examining the situation from this point of view andin carrying out any plan of action that may materialise.Repeat to Peking.
