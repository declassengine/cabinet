1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read to the Cabinet a draft of the passage in theKing1 s Speech relating to China.    Subject to oneminor alteration, which was accepted by theSecretary of State, the draft was approved.The Cabinet agreed  TO approve for submission to HisMajesty the draft of the King1 sSpeech attached in the Appendix(Paper CP.-31 (27)).
i 2.    The Cabinet further considered the question of whetherthe Indian Mixed Brigade, which forms the first instalmentlerenoe: of the Shanghai Defence Force, should be landed at Hong-nilist 7),Con-  Kong or should prooeed to Shanghai.  They were informedsion 5j.that the first transport had been due at Hong-Kong on theprevious day, though, its airival had not as yet beenreported.    The second and third transports were due at hong-Kong two or three days later.Replies to the telegrams sent to Sir Miles Lampsonas the result of the previous meeting (ftos. 106, 107, 108to Peking -  see also Appendix III to.Cabinet 7 (27), Con-clusion 5) were before the Cabinet, together with other. information bearing on the subject, which may be summarisedas follows:-(i) In reply to the request for a report on thealternative policies discussed at the previous meeting ofthe Cabinet, Sir Miles Lampson (Peking telegram No. 247 ofFebruary 5th) stated that if Chen would say that he acceptedour offer as being a satisfactory basis of a completegeneral settlement with us, including the cessation ofi-anti-British agitation, boycott, etc., and not merely of theHankow and Kiukiang questions, and would accompany suchacceptance with a written assurance backed by concreteproofs of good faith, then the need for further troops at shangai would not arise.    But he intimated that the assurance was not likely to be given, and the demand might produce a b.:eak.    (In this connection attention was drawn toPeking telegram No.255, in which Mr 0&apos;Malley questioned whether the hostile activities of the Nationalist Governmentand its associates would be limited by the fact of havinggiven assurances.)   As regards the second alternativeSir Miles Lampson held that the decision must betaken on the merits of the position vis-a-vis Japan,   rr^^
C No. 247) ((ii) The above telegram,followed closely on two telegrams from Sir Miles Lampson, both despatchedonly twenty minutes before , which, taken together, constituted a reply to an earlier telegram sent by. the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsasking for his appreciation of the military situation at Shanghai in certain contingencies (Foreign.office no. 85 to Sir Mies Lamp son j January 29th).    Thefirst of these (No.245), despatched at 7-40 p.m. onFebruary 5th, forwarded a tele gram from the Consul-General, Shanghai, prepared in consultation with thenaval Coimrander-in-Chief, and, in th9 contingenciesmentioned in Foreign Ofiioe No.85, advocated landingone Brigade and three battalions at Shanghai at all costs, and expressed the opinion that any weakeningrelative to the landing of troops at Shanghai wouldbe disastrous.    (NOTTS.      The last two paragraphs ofthis telegram indioated a misapprehension of british policy and haa elicited a reply from the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs pointing out that thetroops had been despatched to Shanghai as a precautionand for protection of life, and that they were not tothebe used as a bargaining counter with/Chinese orWo. 114 to Peking;. &quot; 1others^     In the second telegram (No.246), despatchedfrom Peking at the s:me time as No. 245, Sir MilesLainpson pointed out that all depends on the circura-stances at Shanghai, on which our local authorities must advise. . But he insisted on the importance of retaining our troops in the Far East and of remainingfirm in our determination to defend ourselves ifdriven to it, and ended with a warning that if SunChuan-fang is defeated the crisis may occur almostwithout notice at Shanghai before there would be timeto move forces from Hong-Kong.-3-
(iii) -As regards -the apprehensions of the japanese and American Governments as to the reaction of the landing of British troops at Shanghai on their nationals in the interior (Tokyo telegram No. 61&quot;,Washington telegram No. 61; and Foreign Olfioetelecram to Peking No.  108), Sir Miles Lampsonthe Japanese Ministerreplied that no such thought had ever occurred to/(Peking telegram No. 259) , and that the Americanany greaterMinister did not perceive /     danger to the lives ofthanAmericans in the interior f - may in the ordinary course he involved in giving armed protection to any foreign nationals in China (Peking telegram No.249).But Sir J. Tilley (Tokyo) considered the detention oftroops at Hong-Kong desirable (No.74).(iv) A reasonably satisfactory reply had beenreceived from the Consul-General at Shanghai to questions as to the attitude of the foreign ConsularBody and Municipality at Shanghai towards the landing of British troops (Foreign Office telegram to PekingNo.  108) , and it was stated that up to date thepresence of an Indian Battalion had proved a steadyingrather than a provocative factor (Shanghai telegrarnNo.30).(v) Among reoent telegrams bearing on themilitary situation were, - Tokyo No. 69, of February5th, stating that the Japanese General Staff anticipate the early fall of Hangchow, and Peking No. 251,forwarding from Tsi-man-fu an account of a con-versation with Chang Tsung Chang, who had statedthat Sun had been defeated at Chekiang, that hisown troops were concentrated at Pukow, and thatthey would have to cross the Yangtse to keep theCantonese out of Shanghai owing to Sun&apos;s defeat.In this connection attention was drawn to an earlier telegram (No. 35 of February 1st) fromMi&apos; 0&apos;Malley (Hankow) forwarding a quotation from-4-
Eucene Gh3n&apos;s manifesto of January 22nd, where itwas stated that it is not and never has been -withinthe contemplation of the Nationalist Government to occupy Shanghai by force.    Opinions of the JapaneseGeneral Staff were quoted to the same effect.During the afternoon session of the Cabinet, theChief of the Imperial General Staff attended (from-15 p.m. to 5-30 p*mo) and, in reply to questions,gave information which may be summarised as follows:-The Japanese General Staff, who have senior officers with Sun and at Shanghai, anticipate a Cantonesesuccess in that region.As regards the strength of the relative forces ofSun Chuan-fang and the Cantonese respectively, theinformation Is very conflicting.    Thus, a Japanesereport estimated Sun1s forces at 36,000, a BritishConsular estimate was 65,000, and an Amerloan^estimate100,000.    The Cantonese opposing forces are estimated by the Japanese at 50,000, and by one of our Consuls at35,000.    The equipment and fighting value of both forces are probably about&apos; even.    An attack by the Cantoneseforoes is anticipated within the next two or three days.If they are successful it is calculated that theCantonese Army might reach Shanghai within 10 or 11 days.If the Indian Mixed Erigade is disembarked atlandingHong-Kong, where the^ facilities are not good, itwould, be neoessary to allow tor a week before their arrival at Shanghai, or ten or eleven days before they could be counted on to take up their stations onthe perimeter of the Shanghai Settlements. .  To reckonupon a lower estimate would be to take risks.    Ifthe troops were sent on without being disembarked,they should arrive within 3-jjs da,ys at Shaxighai, and a-5-
dav or wo more would&apos; have to be alloved for them toreach their stations.Colonel Macnaghten, an otiiooi with war experiencewho was no&apos;v a member oi the Shanghai Municipal Council,had informed General  Milne that a force of threeBrigades was required to occupy the perimeter at shangai.It was desirable that the troops should be on the spot a fev/ days before they were called upon to holdShanghai, in order that the positions might be properlyprepared and occupied, though it was understood thatsome wire had already been put in position.In reply to a question as to whether, assuming that the Cantonese might arrive at Shanghai by the19th, it would be satisfactory from a military pointof view if the troops nov- arriving at Hong-Kong weredisembarked there and then re-embarked with a view to being available to defend Shanghai on the above date,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff said &quot;Certainlynot11.One proposal put to the.Cabinet was that a telegram should be sent to Sir Miles Lainpson informing him thatHis Majesty1s Government were bound to take intoaccount the Japanese and American apprehensions as tothe effect on their nationals in China of the landing of British military forces at Shanghai;    that the Araeri-can proposal for the neutralisation of Shanghai was anew factor;    and that it was accordingly proposed toland the troops at Hong-Kong.In view of the opinions expressed by Sir miles lampson, the naval Commander-in-Chief and Consul-General,Shanghai, and the military information.given by the
Chief of the Imperial General Staffy the Cabinet werenot prepared to take the responsibility of stopiJingthe Indian Mixed Briga.de at Hong-Kong.After a discussion oi the question in its military?diplomatic and politioal aspects from 12 noon to 1-30p.m. , and from 3 to 5 p.m. , the Cabinet agreed  (a) That their general policy should bebased on the following considera-tions:-B0ur troops were sent to the far east to safeguard British life in China and particularly at shangai.    That was and is theonly policy of His Majesty1 sGovernment.    The question of thetime at which, and the manner and numbers in which the troops should be landed at Shanghaimust obviously depend upon thelocal situation and the advicewe receive from our representa-tives on the spot.    If theyconsider&quot;that the emergencyrequires immediate disembarka-tion at Shanghai we shall actaccordingly.    If not, the leadingBrigade will be held in readinessat Hong-Kong, while the rest ofthe force is approaching&apos;.    Therecan of course be no question of entering into any arrangement with Mr Chen or anyone else inoonnexion with the movement oftroops despatched to protect british life and property.&quot;(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send a telegram to Sir&quot;Miles Lampson and the Consul-General,Shanghai, informing them that thefollowing instructions were being sentto the naval Commander-in-ChiefYou are authorised to draw on thetroops arriving and approachingif and as you think necessary forthe defenoe of British life at shangai.    We cannot judge thelocal situation from here.    if however there is no immediatedanger locally then it would be convenient from the internationalpoint of view to disembaik theleading Brigade at Hong-Kong.But in no case must such consid-eration stand against the safe-guarding of British life for which you are responsible.    Ask, there-fore , for what you require for the
above purpose.. We authorise you to issue the necessary orders to hong-Kong, Service instructions are being sent separately.(c) That the First Lord of the iuiniiralty,after consultation with the Secretaryof State for; War, should send a tele-gram to the naval Commandor-in-Chiefinfonning him as to the dates of arrival at Hong-Kong of the varioustransports;    and conveying to him the information given to the Cabinetby the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff regarding the delays involvedIn first landing the troops at Hong-Kong, and any other necessary informa-t ion:(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telegraph to Sir miles lampson suoh explanation of this policy as he might deem advisable:(e) That at the moment, there was no urgencyto make any communication to Eugene Chenin regard to the movement of Britishtro troops.
