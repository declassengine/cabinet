RUSSIA.policy towards..previous reference:Cabinet 65(26), Con-elusion 3.)1. Referring to the decision of the Cabinet just before Christinas that the development of the situa-tion in regard to our relations with Russia in all its  aspects should be carefully watched by theMinisters concerned, and that the question should  -be considered afresh after the Recess,  the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs informed his colleagues that he had taken the following action:-.(i) Having received information to the effectthat the diplomatic bags of a foreign power had been tampered with in Russia,he had enquired of the British minister in Moscow whether he was satisfied inregard to the arrangements for the  .secrecy -of the diplomatic bags and ofhis ciphers, and had instructed him to destroy/all ciphers&quot; and secret documentsthat were not essential.    By these means the secrecy of the Government&apos;s decisions would be safeguarded and the amount of confidential matter in the legationwould be reduced to a minimum if a rupture of negotiations should takeplace.(ii) He had instructed the Foreign Office towork out the draft of a new protest to soviet Russia based exclusively onpublished utterances of the soviet authorities.    He proposed to printthis draft and to circulate it to theCabinet,  in order that tdiey might seeexactly what material was availablefor such a purpose.   If it was decidedto make the protest, - the phraseologyof the draft would be re-examined..
2.    The Cabinet had before then a Reportby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-committee  of the Comnittseof Irperial Pafenee or the Situation at Cantor. (paper cp.-8 (2?).During the meeting a draft Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, with special referenceto the defence of Shanghai (Paper CP.-12 (27)) was. hs nd -&apos;. d ro u nd .The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a statement regarding the development of events in China.    It had transpired, he said,  in the case ofHankow that one of the difficulties in undertakingits defence had been that British women and childrenlived outside- the Concession.    Enquiry had been madeas to how far this applied to other British Conces-sions . . P. reply had been received from Amoy to theeffect that it did apply there,  and there was nodoubt that it also applied at Shanghai.    From this it: followed that in normal times our fellow-countrymenfelt it safe to  live under Chinese rule outside the concessions, whieh, however, were available as arefuge;    and that in considering the defence of otherConcessions &quot;&quot;here similar conditions tc these at hankow prevailed, the. mere defence of the concession would not necessarily provide protection to the lives of all our nationals or to their property.Sif Austen Chamberlain&apos; reported that sincethe last meeting       the Cabinet he had tele-graphedto Sir Mil.:S Lampson, for information, a summary ofthe Report by the Chiefs of Staff (Paper CP.-4 (27))together with the Conclusions in full.    Ha had alsosent a telegram to the Consul-General at Cantonbased on the later Report of the Chiefs of staff committee (PapeT CP&apos;.-8 (27)).    This Report, he
-   13pointed out, was basnd on this political assumption &apos;that war with the Chinese National Government mustbe avoided, as -cell as on military considerations.The Japanese Government had agreed to military conversations on the subject of the defence ofShanghai, which were taking place.    The JapanesePress news indicated extreme reluctance to take any action, but this might perhaps be interpreted in thelight of our Ambassador&apos;s report that &quot;The JapaneseGovernment are opposed to any loud noise&quot;.The most serious question, however, for theCabinet to consider, was the position at Shanghai.If it was impossible to come to terms with EugeneChen,, the smaller Concessions might have to be given up, but the position of Shanghai was very different.Owing to the magnitude of our interests there,  itsloss would have lasting disastrous consequences onour position in Asia, and would have most seriousreactions in India and on Japan.    The opinion of thenaval, military and civil authorities in the Par east was that Shanghai was the proper place where we shouldmake our stand.Sir Austen Chamberlain read a communication hefrom Sir Arthur Hirtzelhad received/covering a tele/tram from, the Viceroyindicating that the Government of India was prepared,if necessary, to send a mix-d Brigade or even the equivalent of a Division to Shanghai.Before, however, it was decided as inevitable that resistance must be made at Shanghai, it was important to continue the-; conversations at Hankow -and to give fresh instructions to Sir Miles Lamps on and Mr 0&apos;Kalley.Sir Austen Chamberlain than referred to Sir miles lampson&apos;s telegram No.8, of January 3rd,  in which he
had outlined practical suggestions for riving effectto the Memorandum of Policy approved by the Cabineton December 1, 1926 (Cabinet 61 (.26), Conclusion 4).This had bean examined in the Foreign OffJB e, whowere in entire agreement with Sir Miles Lampson, andhad prepared a .draft telegram of instructions on thesubject.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs con-eluded by setting forth the policy which he proposed  a policy which was adopted as part, of the Govern-raent&apos;s whole policy towards China, as set forth inthe Conclusions  given below.Shortly after, the Chiefs of Staff of the three fighting Services, Sir Arthur Hirtzel (Permanent UnderSecretary to the India Office) and Field Marshal SirClaude Jacob (Military Secretary,  India Office) wareintroduced.The First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staffmade a verbal statement in regard to the draft Reportof the Chiefs       Staff Sub-Committee on the subjectof the defence of Shanghai, in the course of -whichhe added to the Conclusions and Recommendations InParagraph 7 a fresh Conclusion (c)  to the effect thatthe recommendations as to the British forces requiredto be sent out to Shanghai ware based on the assump-tion that the. -ema.indes of the estimated force ofone Division would b-i supplied by other Powers, andthat, if these Powers ware unwilling to co-operate and it was still d^sir^d to hold Shanghai,  the wholeDivision would have to be supplied from british sources.    Ee also summarised the state of the forces now at Shanghai   and the arrangements already mariefor reinforcrmert..
In the course of the discussion the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster,  as Chairman of the trading and Blockade Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, read a summary of the resultsof the enquiries at two meetings which had alreadybeen held.   In regard to the question of whethereffective pressure could be put on the Cantoneseat Hankow by maintaining the closure of the Britishbanks, the conclusion was that this pressure, thoughto some extent effective at first, would diminishwith the passage of time and could not be relied on as a permanent means of affecting Cantonesepolicy.    The situation as regards a general blockade of China appeared at first sight to be favourable.The foreign trade of South China could be stopped,but sooner or later trade would find its way downthrough northern ports unless these were also blockaded,but the injury to our own nationals and to the Chineseelements most friendly to us had to be taken intoconsideration.    The Committee were of opinion that little good would result  from -hat is called a &quot;pacificblockade&quot;.The President of the Board of Trade made a state-ment in regard to the provision of shipping, transport for any force that might be sent.
After careful examination, the Cabinet agreed -General Policy.(a) That regard for the protection of Britishlives no less than the disastrous effect which the surrender of Shanghai toviolence would have on the british position in China,  Japan,  India and throughout the East, precluded thepossibility of basing any policy either on the evacuation, (even if that were possible),  or&apos; on the surrender of Shanghai.(b) That Mr.  O1Malley should be instructedto inform Mr. Eugene Chen,  the CantoneseForeign Minister, that we were preparedto go a very long way towards meetingtheir desires in regard to treaty revision/provided that they in turn were preparedto negotiate a settlement.      But if they refused to.negotiate, and insisted onrecovering the concessions by force, whetherby nob violence or by troops, Eugene. Chen should be told that we should take such steps as we thought fit.      In that event we should hold Shanghai, preferably in concert with other Powers, bnt in thelast resort with British forces only.(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should give approval to thegeneral proposals in Sir Miles Lanpson!telegram No. 8 of January 3rd, whichshould form the basis of Mr.  OrMalleyrsconversations with Mr-. Eugene Chen inregard to the concessions to be made tothe Chinese in connection with the revision of treaties.(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telegraph to the Governmentsof France,  Italy,   United States of  -America, and Japan, in general terms,our proposals&apos; in regard to treatyrevision and our intentions In regardto the defence of Shanghai.      that sir lilies Lampson should be authorisedto make a similar communication tothe Ministers of the Powers at Peking.(e) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telegraph to the JapaneseGovernment the details of reinforcementsit was proposed to send to Shanghai, asset forth below, and to ask what forcesthey were prepared to send.
Defence of Shanghai.(f) That in view of the great importance of-prompt action represented in the Reportof the Chiefs of Staff on the defenceof Shanghai   (CP.  12  (27)), it wasunsafe to base our arrangements on theassumption that the Japanese wouldprovide part of the Division for thedefence of Shanghai,, and that inconsequence the force to be preparedmust not be limited,  as hitherto proposed.,to one mixed brigade and a squadron of aeroplanes.      The preparations to be made should provide at first for a force of onebrigade from India,  one brigade fromthe Mediterranean, and one brigade fromhone *      The force could be reduced ifJapanese co-operation was assured.(g) That the India Office should ask theGovernment of India to make all arrange-ments,  including taking up shipping,for the despatch of a mixed brigade from india, which the Cabinet were informedmight be available for action at Shanghaiin 30 - 32 days time.(h) That the President of the Board of Trade,in consultation with the Secretary ofState for War,  should immediately make arrangements to get ready shipping totake the first British brigade to shangai  (which the Cabinet were informedwould arrive at Shanghai within 40 - 48days time);    and for a second Britishbrigade  (53 - 61 days).(1) That the Secretary of State for war should make preliminary arrangementsfor the despatch of the two Britishbrigades referred to above as soon .as shipping is ready, but, as the JapaneseGovernment might be deterred fromco-operation if we were suddenly to announce the despatch of so large a force, he was.asked to postpone theissue of final orders for 48 hours.He was also asked to postpone the issueof final notices to class   i     reservistsfor a few days.(j) That the First Lord of the admiralty should make arrangements for the despatchat the earliest possible date  (Friday,January 21st.)  of 1,000 marines to shangai  (due in 36.- 37 days), as wellas for the sailing of the first Britishcruiser squadron from the Mediterranean(1,000 rifles) which should arrive in24 days.
(k)  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should instruct Mr 0&apos;Malley tosend all the information he could gatheras to any movement of the Cantoneseforces towards Shanghai.Canton - Defence of Sharoeen.(l) That the above decisions in regard toour general policy and the defence ofShanghai involved a change in thepolitical assumptions on which theChiefs of Staff Committee had been ordered to make their recant report onthe defence of Shameen, and that theCommittee of Chiefs of Staff should re-assemble on the following day tore-examine the question of the defenceof Shamsen on the assumption thatShanghai was to be held and that KisMajesty&apos;s Government were no longercommitted to the policy of avoidinghostilities with the military forcesat Canton in a 1-1 circumstances.    The-Chiefs of Staff were asked to make recommendations for revised instruc-tions to the British Consul-general at Canton, and the Naval and Militaryauthorities at Fong Kong.Miscellaneous.(m) That the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryfor the Colonies should arrange for officials of the Dominions Departmentto place themselves in communicationwith the Permanent Under-Secretary ofState, Foreign Office, with a view tosupplying to the Dominion-   Governmentsfull information of the policy of His-Majesty&apos;s Government and of the reasonsfor it, alike as regards their endeavourto secure a peaceful settlement onliberal terms and their decision not tobe hustled or driven out of Shanghai.(n) That the Secretary .of State for ForeignAffairs should make arrangements, throughthe Press, to prepare public opinionfor the measures indicated in these conclusions.   While making clear thatthere could be no surrender to violence and that the military dispositions hadthe object of carrying out the Govern-mentVs pledge to defend the lives ofBritish subjects in China&apos; t  emphasis should be laid onthe fact that the Government&apos;s policy was primarily one of conciliation and.a settlement by agreement.I Whitehall Gardens, SX1,January 17, 1927.- B-
