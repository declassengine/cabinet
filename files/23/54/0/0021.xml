PROHIBITIONOP EXTORT OP^PLOSIVEST0 CHINA.(previous reference:Cabinet 18(87), Oon-conclusion 10.)1* The President of the Board of Tradeconsulted the Cabinet as to a Proclamation whichthe Admiralty desired to have issued prohibiting the export to China of all kinds of explosives(in addition to munitions of war, which arealready prohibited).    This could only be effected by issuing a Proclamation prohibiting the export-ation of these explosives to all destinations,and a second Proclamation permitting their axport-ation to all countries other than China.The Cabinet felt some doubt about an action involving-so cumbrous a proceduret butagreed  -That if the First Lord of theAdmiralty was satisfied thatthe Chief of the Naval Staffconsidered this action abso-lutely essential,  the Presidentof the Board of Trade shouldbe authorised to take thenecessary steps to obtain the proclamation.V,.
2.    The Secretary of State for Air consulted the Cabinet as to a request from Chang Tso-lin,the General in North China, to purchase tenaeroplanes for training purposes.    From the pointof view of the maintenance of the aircraft industry the order would be useful.    The ForeignOffice,  however, had informed the Air Ministrythat they were opposed to allowing the order tobe fulfilled as it would be inconsistent withour policy of impartiality.Doubt was found to exist as to whetherthe order could be given without a breach of oneof the Washington Treaties, and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs undertook to enquire into this point.
34 A Supplement (Appendix)  to the Reportof the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (paper g.P.--110 (87)) was handed round during theMeeting,    This Supplement, which bore theonlysignatures/of the Chief of the Naval staff and the Chief of the Air Staff (owing to theabsence at Camberley of the Chief of theImperial General Staff), drew attention toevidence that the Cantonese were taking stepsto interfere with, free movement on the Yangtse,and that delay in taking action would rendermore difficult the carrying out of the plansproposed.Pending the receipt of a reply from theNaval Commander-in-Chief to the telegram ashingfor his opinion,  the Cabinet were unable totake any action in regard to the Supplement,and were only able to take note thereof.The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet that the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had under consideration thedesirability of reinforcing our forces in theFar Fjast, at Singapore or Hong-Kong, either byadditional units or drafts.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn toa telegram dated March 30, 1987,  from theGeneral Officer Commanding the Shanghai. defence force stating that missionaries report a fewsmall mines in a gunboat en route to Wuhu,  andthe suggestion was made that  the attention ofthe Naval 0ommander-in-Chief should be drawn tothis threat to his line of communications.
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked the First Lord of the Admiralty to make sure that any telegram on this subject whichhe might send to Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt shouldbe repeated to Sir Miles Lampson.When the Cabinet was adjourning, informa-tion was received that a telegram giving theviews of the Naval Commander-in-Chief on theproposals of the Chiefs of Staff Committee hadbeen received by the Admiralty, but that itwould probably require elucidation by a furtherexchange of telegrams.The Secretary was instructed by thePrime Minister to warn the Cabinet that anemergency meeting might be required on thefollowing day.

A P PEN D IX.SUPPLEMENT TO THE REPORT  OF THE CHIEFS OFSTAFF ON THE SITUATION IN CHINA OF MARCH 29th,1927.    (C.I.D.  PAPER No.  784-B).Recent telegrams from China indicate increasingdetermination on the part of the Cantonese Authoritiesand the forces under their command to take steps toenforce tneir will on the Yangtse and oppose withforce the free movement of ships up and down theriver.Guns are being mounted to cover the anchorage at nanking.A gun on Lion Hill at Nanking is kept trained on ships under weigh. Ships on passage up and down theriver report being fired on by guns of small calibre,machine-guns and rifles.Mines are being reported as being conveyed up theriver in a Chinese gunboat.The situation is likely to be aggravated by delay in taking definite action0     Each day of further delaywill render more difficult the carrying out of the plans put forward in the Report.(Signed)  BEATTY.H.TR3NCHARD.31,  1927.
