Burgis, Assistant Secretary.Sftuat?onWay L WITH reference to War Cabinet 546, Minute 1, Sir eric geddes, at the request of Mr. Bonar Law, explained the position regarding the railwaymen&apos;s claims and their cost to the country.He said that the whole pre-war railway wages amounted to50,000,000L The present war-wage cost a further 60,000,0002., andif the men&apos;s demands now put forward were granted it would bring the wage bill up to a total of 151,000,OOOZ. This figure,however, did not include a further 20,000,000Z. for the increased cost of material. The War Cabinet had approved the railway executive carrying on negotiations for a 50 per cent, increase onthe pre-war wage (War Cabinet 536, Minute 2). The principalitem of the men&apos;s demands was the conversion of the war-wage intoa permanent wage. Mr. Thomas had said that if the men were treated reasonably he would do his utmost to prevent a strike.   He[826]-389
realised that the railways were the only industry that had tried to convert the war-wage into a permanent wage, and, owing to thepresent disturbed conditions, he would be willing to postpone thefinal settlement of this question provided that the war-wage was continued at its present rate until at least the end of the year.Apart from this, however, there were other demands which, in mr. Thomas&apos;s opinion, were reasonable, and the Government shouldgrant them, viz., (a) additional wages (time and a-quarter) fornight work, i.e., between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. ; (b) the application ofuniform district rates. Sir Eric Geddes explained that the position with regard to district rates was that at a big railway centre, suchas Leeds, goods porters of various railway companies were paiddifferent rates for the same work. The railwaymen wanted to bring in district rates so that men in one district on similar wTork shouldreceive the same pay. He understood that the Railway Executivesaw considerable, but not insurmountable, difficulty in carrying thisproposal into effect, except in connection with a general revisionof rates. Another demand was that there should be standardpay of time and a-half for Sunday duty and time and a-quarter for overtime. The last point was that the men desired to have a say we the management. He (Sir Eric Geddes) thought that the men might be satisfied on this if a guarantee were given to appoint arepresentative advisory committee or council on which the railway-men would have a voice in the Ways and Communications Ministry.He did not himself see much difficulty in bringing this about. Tosum up, Mr. Thomas had said that if the war-wage was continued until the end of the year, the night work concession granted, anarrangement come to over district rates, time and a-half for Sundayduty and time and a-quarter for overtime to be uniform on all lines if these concessions were granted by the Government he (Mr. Thomas)would make the strongest recommendations to his union for their acceptance.   .Mr. Bonar Law asked Sir Herbert Walker what he estimated the cost of these concessions would be.Sir Herbert Walker replied that it was difficult to estimateoff-hand, but that, so far as night duty and time and a-quarter were concerned, he thought the cost, if applied to the whole staff, wouldbe between 5,O0O,O0OZ. and 8,0O0,000Z.Mr. Bonar Law said that tbe Government had been prepared togrant a 50 per cent, increase on the pre-war wages, the remainder of the war-wage to be on a sliding scale and varied as the costof living rose or fell. The proposition now before them was that anadditional 5,000,000Z. to S,000,OOOZ. should be added to the wages paid now until the end of the year. All that the Government werelosing, therefore, was, say; 7,000,000 for night-work, plus anythingthey might have recouped from the possible fall in the cost of livingfrom now to the end of the year. As the miners would probably begiven something in addition to their present wage, he did not see how it was possible for the Government to offer the railwaymen a lower wage than they were now getting.Sir Herbert Walker explained that, in addition to the 7,000,000/.,there must be added the cost of the other minor concessions, so. thatthe 110,000,OOOZ. would amount to about 125,000,000.&apos; The Minister of Labour said that, so far as keeping up the war-wage during the present year was concerned, he thought this wouldhave to be done in every industry. He had received many resolutionsto this effect, and a- Committee of the Industrial Conference had unanimously reported in favour of this being done.Sir Herbert AValker said that the great difficulty he saw, if thepresent proposals of Mr. Thomas were accepted, was that Mr. Bromleywould not fall into line. In addition, in his opinion, he would bebreaking faith with Mr. Bromley, inasmuch as he had promised thatthe higher-rated men should get something immediately, and their advance was now being put off until the end of the year. his proposal was that the negotiations should proceed on the same lines
as hitherto, and that Mr. Bromley&apos;s union should get concessions assoon as a general settlement was arrived at. He proposed that thewar-wage plus wage should in no case be less than it was to-day. TheRailway Executive had already offered time and a-quarter for over-time, and something for night duty. A guarantee had been given that there should be a revision of the wages paid to-day, and theypromised, in addition, that all anomalies should disappear and ratesbe standardised. With regard to the management, he proposedsetting up a committee on the lines of the National ConciliationBoard, on which would be representatives of the Railway executive and the two Railway Unions, and this Committee would deal withall questions affecting the men between now and the time when theGovernment had set up some future control of the railways.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, from the financialpoint of view, if the concessions now suggested by Mr. Thomas were granted, the situation would be appalling. There was no prospectof the railways paying, and he did not see where the money to paythese extra wages was to come from.Sir Eric Geddes suggested that the burden should be shiftedon to the shoulders of the users of the railways, and he thought that,in whatever announcement the Government made with regard.to thenegotiatioiis now going on, a forecast should be given that animmediate rise in freight rates must be contemplated.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he would view any increase in the freight rates with great apprehension. The Govern-ment was pledged to assist home trade, especially agriculture, and now he was told that there was going to be an increase in therailway rates. There would be strong opposition to this in theHouse of Commons, and the effect would be to damage home industryand especially to cripple agriculture.The Minister of Labour said that, in his opinion, it was worthwhile to pay the extra cost of the railwaymehs demands in order tosecure their support at the present time. If the miners came out on strike, the railwaymen might come out, too, but with this difference,that if the above concessions were now granted, they would bestriking without a grievance. In addition, the transport workers had no ground for a strike, although they would probably come outif the miners did so.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he must draw theattention of the Cabinet to the effect these concessions would have on the navy and the army, and that this addition to the miners&apos; andrailwayrnen&apos;s wages would probably bring forth a demand for anincrease in the pay of His Majesty&apos;s forces. The Admiralty were at present experiencing great difficulty in obtaining sufficientrecruits for the service.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) An offer should be made on behalf of the Government tothe railwaymen on the following lines : (i.) The continuance of the present war-wage pluswage until the end of the year,(ii.) Wage and a-quarter for night work,(iii.) An arrangement as to uniform district ratesfor similar grades,(iv.) Time and a-half for Sunday duty and time anda-quarter for overtime, to be uniform on allfines.(v.) Machinery in the new Ways and Communica-tions Ministry by which the railwaymenshould be permitted to make representations on questions of management.Sir Herbert Walker and Sir A. Butterworth expressed their concurrence with the above proposals with the exception of (ii), inwhich they would substitute &quot; some extra payment &quot; for &quot; wage anda-quarter.&quot;
(&amp;.) The Committee which had met that afternoon should meeton the following day in order to put into concrete formthe offer which the Government had decided to make tothe railwaymen.(c.) The president of the Board of Trade should arrange for adequate publicity with regard to the negotiations.(d.) Immediate preparations should be made to advance railway freight rates.Possible Strike and 2. With Reference to War Cabinet 538, Minute 5, the MinisterUnemployment of Labour said that the Industrial Unrest Committee proposed that,Donation. in the event of a strike, all existing systems of insurance benefits should be suspended, and the following flat rate should be paid toall persons who would be entitled to unemployment donation underthe original scheme instituted in November last : 10s. a week to adults (of 15 years of age and over).10s. a week to wives (if not drawing donation in their ownnames).5s. a week to children (up to the age of 15 years).He understood that the Treasury took exception to boys and girls between the ages of 15 and 18 receiving 10s. a week, also tothe application of this scheme to Ireland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he objected to boysand girls between the ages of 15 and IS receiving the sameunemployment donation as a full-grown man or woman, inasmuch as it did not correspond with the wages paid if they were at work.The War Cabinet sanctioned the proposal that all existingsystems of insurance benefits should be suspended in theevent of a strike, and approved the scale suggested by theMinister of Labour, with the following exceptions : (a.) Only 5s. a week should be paid to boys and girlsbetween the ages of 15 and 18.(b.) The supplementary donation in respect of dependent children under 15 should not bepaid in respect of more than four children.(c.) The emergency scheme may be applied to ireland on the understanding that its operation will be confined to persons entitled to out-of-doordonation under the rules at present in force inthis country and unemployed wage earners intrades in which the Lord Lieutenant, with the prior concurrence of their Lordships and of theMinister of Labour, certifies that extensiveunemployment exists as a result of the coal strike.2, Whiteliall Gardens, S.W. 1..
