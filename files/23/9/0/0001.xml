Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; Pay-Committee.Gratuities toEegular and temporary Officersof the Navy, Army,and Boyal AirForce.1. THE War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the Chairman of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee dealingwith the recommendations of that Committee in regard to the pay-ment of war gratuities to regular and temponry officers of theRoyal Navy, Army, and Royal Air Force (Paper GT.-6592).Mr. Barnes explained that the Committee, of which he wasChairman, recommended that a gratuity for regilar officers of thethree services should be paid at the rate of sixty-sven days&apos; pay forthe first years service, with increments of 1Z. pei month for ranksup to lieutenant-colonel; 21. for colonels and Trigadier-generals ;and 31. for higher ranks, for each subsequent monh&apos;s service abroadafter the first year, similar increments being giren to equivalentranks in the Navy. With regard to temporary oncers, the rate ofgratuity to be paid was already laid down in articL 497 of the royal warrant for Pay of the Army.The Prime Minister expressed the opinion tht, before the WarCabinet approved these recommendations, it w.s advisable thatField-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig should be comulted, as lie was certainly entitled to express an opinion on tiis question. Asdemobilisation of officers was now taking place, it vas also necessarythat an announcement should be made on this question as early aspossible, and Mr. Lloyd George therefore suggested that theFinancial Secretary to the War Office should proaed to France that day in order that Field-Marshal Haigs opinion night be known assoon as possible.The Financial Secretary to the War Office uncertook to proceedto France at once in order to cousult vith Field-MarshalHaig on this question.The First Sea Lord said&apos; that the Board of Aimiralty, and theParliamentary Secretary to the Air Council said thet the Air Council,had agreed in these recommendations of the Comnittee, but if any alteration was made in the rates of gratuity for arny officers it wouldbe necessary for the Admiralty and the Royal Air Force to reconsider the position from the point of view of their respectve services.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The recommendations of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; pay committee with reference to the scales of war gratuities to be paid to regular and temporary offeers of the Navy,Army, and Royal Air Force should be ipproved, subjectto the concurrence of Field-Marshal Sh Douglas Haig.(b.) The Financial Secretary to the War Office shoxdd proceed&quot;&quot;ield-Marshal Sirould inform Mr.at once to France to consult withDouglas Haig on this question, and s(iBarnes of the result of the consultation.1(c.) No public announcement should be made tn the press untilMr. Barnes had received the report [of tie FinancialSecretary to the War Office on his return from France.The Victuallingand Supply of enemy, Allied, and neutral Countries.2. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 48, Minute 6, lord curzon read a telegram from Paris from Lord Robart Cecil, inwhich it was stated that Mr. Hoover was urging thkt the british delegates to the proposed International Council should be appointedwithout any further delay, and should come to Paris immediately.It was recalled that on the 31st December, 1918 the imperial war Cabinet had appointed Lord Reading and Sir JToseph Maclayto serve on the International Council.Lord Reading, however, who was strongly pressed to accept thepost of senior British delegate, once more expressed great reluctance to undertake the post. In view of the great urgency bf the question,he undertook to proceed to Paris with Sir John B(tole, as a pro-
Co-ordination ofDemobilisation.Procedure.3. With reference to AVar Cabinet 513, Minute 2, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by Sir Eric Geddes (paper g.T.-6612) relating to the misapprehension which existed in thefourteen various Ministries concerned in demobilisation, both as tothe meaning and purport of his appointment as representing theWar Cabinet on the question of demobilisation, and also as to theprocedure to be adopted. Sir Eric Geddes outlined in his Memo-randum the instructions he suggested should be issued to thedepartments concerned.The War Cabinet approved the adoption of the procedure as given in the Appendix.Question of which department should deal with theprovision oftraining for menand women.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by sir eric Geddes (Paper G.T.-(H:&apos;)05) relating to the question of which department should be responsible for the provision of training formen and women.Sir Eric Geddes said that he had gone very carefully into thewhole question, and it appeared to him that the Ministry of Labourwas the appropriate department to deal with this question, especially as the. Trade Unions were so vitally concerned. He suggested,however, that as Sir Stephenson Kent&apos;s department was alreadyoverburdened with work, a separate Training Section should be setup in the Ministry of Labour, to which the expert staff of SirStephenson Kent&apos;s department, which had hitherto been dealingwith this question, should be transferred. There were, however,two other departments which might deal with the question, viz., theBoard of Education, because the scheme involved an extension ofthe technical training which the Board of Education already provided, and the Ministry of Pensions, because that Ministry wasproviding the training for disabled, soldiers.Mr. Barnes said that he thought confusion would result if thetraining of disabled soldiers was taken away from the Ministry ofPensions. It would also be necessary to overcome the difficulty thatstatutory provision had been made that the Ministry of pensions should deal with this question.    * -Mr. Chamberlain said that, as the Labour Ministry was offering -training to all discharged men, and the question of disabled men was only a small part of the whole problem, he thought that theMinistry of Labour was the appropriate department to be held responsible for the entire problem.visional arrangement, and to confer with Lord Robert Cecil on thesubject.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that if Lord Reading could not seehis way to serve as the senior British delegate, Lord Robert Cecilshould be invited to act, having regard to the latter&apos;s wide experience in inter-Allied food and transport organisation.Lord Reading, however, said that he had spoken to lord robert Cecil about it, and that Lord Robert had declined to act.The War Cabinet requested Lord Curzon to reply to Lord Robert Cecil to the effect that The question had been brought to the Cabinet that morning. The urgency of the matter was recognised. lord reading had kindly consented to come over to Paris withoutdelay, and would bring Sir John Beale with him. these arrangements would not be permanent, and Lord Readingwould discuss future plans on his arrival.Lord Reading undertook to.notify Sir John Beale.
Mr. Hodge then explained the arrangements which the Ministryof Pensions had made for dealing with the training of disabled soldiers. He said that this involved long and complicated negotia-tions with the Trade Unions, which had been going on for several months. He was satisfied that the disabled men must have thespecial training which they were now receiving.The Prime Minister said there was a vast number of young officers and men who, had it not been for the war, would have been trained in some capacity or other. He was of opinion that agricul-ture opened up a great prospect in this direction. Tt was worthwhile training a good number of the better-educated classes to put their brains into the land. There were several large houses whichhad been used as hospitals, and which the owners would in all probability not be able to afford to keep up, that might be used astraining centres for agricultural purposes.Sir Stephenson Kent said that this problem of training inagriculture was already being dealt with by the AppointmentsDepartment.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that the question oftraining was a very wide problem, and he thought that it might beplaced as a whole under the Ministry of Labour, who could &quot; farmout&quot; to the various Departments functions which were their especialcare.With regard to the training of classes 6, 7, and S of theMemorandum (paragraph 3) under discussion Discharged male civil war-workers,Discharged Service women, and discharged women civil war-workers,Sir Eric Geddes said that the problem of dealing with these classeswas dependent on the passage of the War Pledges Bill, and the subsequent discussions with Trade Unions, as until then it would beimpossible to determine for what trades women should be trained.He recommended that these three categories should receive trainingsxibject to the Ministry of Labour going into the question.Sir David Shaekleton said that he would like the proposals ofthe Women&apos;s Trade Council, relating to the training of women, to be examined by the Women&apos;s Committees which had been set up in the big provincial centres.The AVar Cabinet decided &apos;(a.) To accept Sir Eric Geddes&apos; proposals in principle, and tomake the Ministry of Labour generally responsible forthe provision of industrial training for men and womenas set out in his Memorandum (Paper G.T.-6605). TheMinistry of Labour should, however, consult with otherDepartments where these are concerned, and arrange with them to carry out training schemes within theirrespective provinces according to a co-ordinated plan.(6.) That the question of the training of women workers shouldreceive further consideration in the Ministry of Labourbefore a final decision is given.Utilisation of 5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by SirNational Factories.    Eric Geddes (Paper G.T.-6601) with regard to the utilisation ofNational Factories.Sir Eric Geddes explained that there were four classes of factories for disposal: -Class A. (about 16 to 20). Factories   which it may prove necessary to retain permanently.Class B (about 85). Factories which are suitable for use as industrial concerns.Class C (about 25). Factories which  are not suitable for industrial purposes, but which will probably be required-
during the transition period as magazines for breakingdown ammunition.Glass D. (about 115). -Factories which will revert to their original owners and to their pre-war uses.He was at the moment most concerned with the disposal of class B. He understood that the War Cabinet had approved of thesale of these factories (War Cabinet 491, Minute 1), and theMinistry of Munitions had passed to the Ministry of Reconstructionthe names of thirty factories in this class. Dr. Addison had expressed agreement to the sale of all except two, namely, the factories at Hackney Marshes and Birtlej-. The sale had been inthe hands of Sir Howard Frank, but he (Sir Howard Frank) felt a difficulty in going ahead, as it was understood that the PrimeMinister had mentioned informally, at a Cabinet Meeting, that thesale of National Factories was a question which would have to come before the Cabinet as a whole.The questions Sir Eric Geddes wanted decided were: (i.) Does the Cabinet decide that the Government is not goingto embark on a policy of taking over factories for Statemanufacture and sale of articles ?(ii.) Were factories for which permission to sell had been givento be offered on preferential terms either to Trade Unions,Local Authorities, or Co-operative Societies ?Sir Eric Geddes said that there was a good deal to be said infavour of the three bodies mentioned above being given preference,other things being equal.Sir James Stevenson said that it was impossible to manufactureany trade articles in these factories unless a selling organisation was attached to the factory. There were, however, a certain number ofthings of which the Government was a very large buyer, and if theGovernment needed these things there would be no question of entering into competition with the private trader. For example,Post Office cables was one of these articles.Sir Albert Stanley stated that the English railwaysmanufactured their own locomotives, and there was no chance forany great private enterprise in this industry, with the result that wehad no locomotives to export. He urged strongly that the factoriesshould not proceed along national lines, as it would prejudice thedevelopment of the private trader. He instanced the extraordinarycost of Woolwich, which, in his opinion, was the foundation of our industrial difficulties, during the war. Enterprise backed by theState, once it had started, must continue, and was bound, in his view, to compete with the private trader.Sir James Stevenson differed from Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s view with regard to Woolwich. The prices at Woolwich, he said,enabled us to reduce prices to local manufacturers. Also, our experience gained during the war had reduced the cost.Mr. Chamberlain said there was the greatest difnciilty in reducing the number of men employed at Woolwich. The recordthere had been a cycle of discharge, distress, and deputations. Ifthese institutions were multiplied all over the country it wouldhave a very harmful effect.Mr. Montagu asked, if these factories were sold, would they beallowed to produce munitions.The Prime Minister pointed out that the League of Nations mightprohibit the private manufacture of munitions, and any buyers of factories must not be under a misapprehension in this direction.The decision they had to arrive at on this question was an important one. He would like to know if the factories could be of any use in producing material for transportation.Sir Albert Stanley said he did not think they would be of the slightest use. He had had a careful investigation made of the[826] C
whole trade situation of &quot;the country, and he had found that tradewas stagnating at the present time, and there were hardly anysigns of development. Whether or not the Government was goingto manufacture articles for its own use was given as one of the explanations of this stagnation.Sir Eric Geddes said that there were several other reasons forthe slackness of trade, such as the uncertainty of prices, wages,labour, the War Pledges Bill, taxation, &amp;c.Mr. Chamberlain said that, taking transportation in its widestsense, we had a world-market for steel rails, and if we set upnational factories to produce these it would knock out privateenterprise. He gave as an example of the good results achievedfrom the contrary principle the building of battleships. TheGovernment placed large orders with private firms, and this enabled the private firms to obtain foreign orders.Sir Albert Stanley, referring to the manufacture of steel rails,said that it cost us now 15Z. a ton, whereas the cost in the UnitedStates was only 101 a ton, and, as far as he could see, there was notthe remotest chance of our getting back this trade. Our presentsteel positionjwas worse than it had ever been before. We couldmanufacture steel in this country cheaper than in the United States,but the trade would not invest the capital required to erect up-to-datemills.Mr. Roberts said thafif you embarked on trade you had got tobe a monopolist. If the Government entered into trade, stagnationwould remain and unemployment would become greater than it wasto-day. We could not afford to embark upon such an enterprise atthis stage.Mr. BonaY Lawfsuggested that the Ministry of Munitions shouldmake a list of any articles they contemplated the national factoriescould manufacture.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Ministry of Munitions should be instructed to proceedwith the least possible delay, subject to their discretion as to what factories should be maintained for armamentproduction, with the sale of the eighty-five factoriesmentioned in Class B of Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Memorandum(Paper G.T.-6601), giving preference, other things being equal, to Trade Unions, Co-operative Societies, LocalAuthorities, and Public Utility Societies, within thelimits of legitimate local enterprise. In these transactionsthe Ministry of Munitions should consult the Ministry ofRoconstruction as hitherto.(6.) The State will not compete with private enterprise in themanufacture of articles of general trade.(c.) Subject to (6), and with a view to a decision as to thepossible utilisation for State purposes of some of the factories mentioned &apos; above, the Ministry of Munitionsshould at once prepare a report of articles which theyconsider any specific national factory could make withouta sales department being attached to it, and of which theGovernment will be the sole buyers. After discussionwith Sir Eric Geddes, the President of the Board ofTrade, and the Minister of Reconstruction, the list shouldbe brought before the Cabinet for final approval.Future Shipping 6. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 43, Minute 7, thePolicy. War Cabinet took note of the decision arrived at by the Committeeappointed to consider the shipping policy, also the disposal ofGovernment ships, &amp;c. (Paper G.T.-6544). It was explained thatthe Committee; had unanimously approved the policy in regard
National Shipyards. 7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theShipping Controller, in which a decision was asked for withreference to the disposal of national shipyards on the basis of a saleat current value, to be determined by independent arbitratorsmutually appointed (Paper G.T.-6543), together with a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade in favour of their disposal(Taper G.T.-6599), and a Memorandum by Mr. Barnes, dissenting(Paper G.T.-655S).Sir Joseph Maclay said that there were three shipyardsin question. The original intention had been to provide thirtyslips. The yards were approaching completion, and it would benecessary that the;/ should be completed, but there w-as no reason why they should then be used by the Government to build ships.Up to the present not a ship had been turned out, and the keels of only six had been laid. The cost of the yards, &amp;c, up to thepresent had been about 6,OOO.O0OZ,, and probably about two-thirds of this would have to be written off as war loss. AVith referenceto the fabricated ships, they had proved to be very expensive,though they might ultimately become a success.Mr. Barnes maintained that it would be politically inadvisable to dispose of the yards at present, and that the experiment of Stateownership and operation shoiild be continued. Our experience inthe early days of the war had shown that a number of our shipbuildersbad fallen behind in the organisation and equipment of their yards,and unless something was done to stimulate them they would be in danger - of being eclipsed by American shipbuilders. It would beregarded as a severe blow to State enterprise if yards which hadcost 6,000,000Z. were sold to private owners for 2,000,000LThe view was generally expressed that the stimulus referred toby Mr. Barnes as necessary would not readily be supplied by Stateshipbuilding, nor was it probable that the yards would be economically worked. Further, if it were proposed to restrict the shipyards to building one type of vessel, the State would then havethe monopoly of that type and would not be subject to the stimulusof free competition.Lord Pirrie (who arrived at this stage of the discussion) saidthat the Government had given a pledge to the shipbuilders thatthe national shipyards were being set up solely for war emergencypurposes, and would not subsequently be allowed to compete withordinary shipbuilding: The Government would be placed in an awkward position if they now departed from that pledge. In hisopinion, had the war continued for some time, the national shipyardswould have proved an enormous success; but, owing to thearmistice, it was necessary to review the situation. He was opposedto shipbuilding by the State in peace time, but, in order to avoidfriction, he would advise the retention, for some months, of one ofthe yards (Finch&apos;s), and the disposal of the other two. Finch&apos;syard could absorb an additional 2,000 men, and it could perhaps be sold to better advantage in, say, six months&apos; time.Lord Reading stated that similar discussions were taking placein the United States, where it was estimated that the loss on someshipbuilding enterprises would run to 40,000,OOOZ.to shipping and ships set out in the Ministry of ShippingMemoranda (Papers G.T.-6472 and 6482), but that subsequentlyMr. Hughes who had been represented on the Committee, haddissented from the conclusions arrived at (Paper G.T.-6564).The Shipping Controller stated that arrangements were beingmade with a number of shipping people who had lost ships largelyduring the period of the war, whereby a large block of tonnage nowbuilding to the order of the Government would be taken over at what the Shipping Controller hoped would show comparatively little, if any, loss to the Government.
It was generally agreed that, if the yards were to be sold, theyhad better be sold at one time, in order to avoid a repetition of any public agitation.Dr. Addison suggested that there might be less opposition ifthe yards were leased and not sold.The Prime Minister said it would be useful if Sir JosephMablay could ascertain if the yards could not be taken overunder some form of co-operative arrangement. There would be considerable advantage if workmen could in that way be broughtto realise some of the difficulties of organising a large enterprise.Dr. Addison thought that semi-public bodies like railwaycompanies might be given a preferential option to buy the yardsafter the co-operators and trade.unionists, but it was pointed outthat there were serious drawbacks to railway companies extendingtheir control over the manufacture of their own plant.The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposal of the Shipping Controller to dispose of the yards.Mr] Barnes asked that his dissent should be recorded.Demobilisation of 8. With reference to a memorandum by the Secretary for thethe Eoyal Air Air Force (Paper D.N.-2), Lord Weir stated that he would like a force. very early Cabinet decision on the post-war strength of the RoyalAir Force, as requested in his memorandum (Paper G.T.-6478).It was impossible to proceed satisfactorily with the problems ofdemobilisation unless such decision was forthcoming, and he was afraid further delay might lead to trouble, especially as the staff ofthe Air Force was on a temporary basis.Demobilisation. 9. The Prime Minister informed the*War Cabinet that he had-            just learned that some 1,500 soldiers, belonging to the Army ServiceDemonstrations by !. Corps at Park Royal, had arrived in Downing Street and wereSoldiers. asking for an interview with him.General Sir William Robertson stated that news of disaffectionat this centre had been received the previous evening, and anattempt had been made to dissuade the men from marching toWhitehall, but without success. They had been intercepted that morning in Edgware Road, and it was intended to divert them tothe Horse Guards Parade, but apparently they had succeeded in reaching Downing Street. The delegates of the soldiers had putforward their grievances in reasonable language, and he (sir william) was prepared to believe that some of the grievances weregenuine. They complained of being called at an unreasonably earlyhour, and of the badness of the food served to them. He had asked that the delegates should be sent to see him.The Prime Minister said he was quite prepared to see the delegates or the. soldiers in a body if the War Cabinet thought thatwoxdd be the right course. In any case it was desirable that astatement on demobilisation should be made at the earliest possible moment, and in some way likely to attract widespread public attention. It might be best to send the men home and to receivethe delegates only that afternoon, and the policy of the Governmentcould be fully explained to them, and in that way be made public.Lord Milner said he doubted the wisdom of the Prime Ministerseeing the soldiers or their representatives, as it would form a badprecedent, and similar processions would attempt to march toLondon from other parts of the country. It was important to makeit perfectly plain to the soldiers that such processions would not beallowed. If there were legitimate grievances there were properchannels through which representations might be made. The WarOffice took particular care to deal with any grievances which were
reported to them. If, on the other hand, the tendency to indisciplineand disorder were allowed to spread unchecked, the results might prove to be serious.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff strongly disliked thesuggestion that the Prime Minister should confer with soldiers&apos;delegates who had disregarded their officers. The soldiers&apos;delegation bore a dangerous resemblance to a Soviet. If such a practice were to spread, the consequences would be disastrous.He had heard of no genuine case of bad feeding. If the PrimeMinister were to meet the soldiers at all, he should prefer that thewhole body of soldiers should be addressed by him, and not the delegates only.Sir Eric Geddes suggested that the men might be drawn upin the Horse Guards Parade in military formation, under their officers, and that then they might be addressed by the PrimeMinister.General Sir William Robertson explained that the officers werenot with the men.General Feilding (who entered at this stage) stated that themen were now at the Horse Guards Parade, and that theirgrievances, so far as he had been able to ascertain from theirdelegates, consisted of misunderstandings about, demobilisation,complaints of overcrowding and bad feeding, and about thedistribution of gratuities to old regular soldiers. They refusedto accept his answers, on the ground that they were under GeneralAVbolcom be, of the Eastern Command. He thought the men would return to camp if they were seen by Sir William Robertsonand informed that the Prime Minister was about todssue a statement on demobilisation.Lord Milner said that in the neighbourhood of London therewere some 50,0U0 men belonging to the Army Service Corps, themajority of whom had been engaged chiefly in civil work, and hadnot had much experience of strict army discipline. They by nomeans confined their grievances to Questions of demobilisation, butraised questions of food and hours.The Quartermaster-General said no complaints of the badnessor insufficiency of food had reached him. The men at Park Royalwere being employed in driving and riding instructions and vehicleinstructions, &amp;c, but he did not know whether there was any truth in the statement that they were called out to work at 5.30 a.m., as this question of interior economy was a matter for the GeneralOfficer Commanding the District.Lord Weir said that only one complaint with regard to foodhad reached him, but there had been demands for a 44-hours week,and in his opinion there would presently be demands for wages atcivilian rates.General Feilding, in reply to a question by the Prime Minister,said that at present only a small minority of the troops weredisaffected, but that the agitation would spread if demonstrationswere not prohibited.The Prime Minister said they must be quite sure that any stepsthey decided on with a view to suppressing the demonstrations that were taking place were certain to be successful. They had torecognise that the position was inevitably one of great difficulty.Between four and five millions of men had been undergoing for years the severe strain of war, with death confronting them. Thatstrain had suddenly ceased, and a violent reaction was natural,especially as nine-tenths of the men knew that they would not serve as soldiers again, and saw around them civilians drawing very high rates of pay.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that some of the prevailingdiscontent was due to the effort which had been made to keep thebalance even between the rates of demobilisation of the forces athome and abroad. To do this it had been necessary to keep menback at home who could have been released.   The men knew this,[826] D
and feared that they were being kept back with a view to sendingthem to Russia. It had now been arranged with Lord Milner togive up the attempt to maintain equality in the rate of demobilisa-tion between the forces at home and abroad.In reply to an observation by Lord Weir, it was agreed that thequestion of arranging uniformity in the settlement of food, hours,and similar questions was one for mutual agreement between thethree services concerned.The War Cabinet requested General Sir William Robertson to meet the delegates of thesoldiers assembled in the Horse Guards&apos; Parade, and toinform them that officers would be sent at once to ParkRoyal to investigate their alleged grievances ; that anygrievances which reached the Government through theproper channels would receive the consideration of thePrime Minister and the Secretary of State for War, andthat the Prime Minister, in considtation with the Secretaryof State for War, was preparing a statement on demobilisa-tion, which would appear in the press on the following morning.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January 8, 1919.
APPENDIX.Co-ordination of Demobilisation Procedure.&quot; Sir Eric Geddes, as Minister in charge of the Co-ordination of demobilisation and the Rehabilitation of Industry, will in no way usurp the executive functionsof the Ministers at present responsible.&quot; In the event of any Ministry wishing to obtain Cabinet authority on anysubject directly concerned with Demobilisation, the Minister responsible will submit a memorandum to the War Cabinet in the ordinary way, and in case of difference of opinion between Ministers which they fail to reconcile afterconference, each Minister will submit a memorandum, jointly if possible.&quot; This memorandum will either be dealt with by the War Cabinet in theusual way, or by Sir Eric Geddes, as may be decided.&quot; The War Cabinet Secretariat will summon meetings of the ministers concerned in such memoranda either for full meetings of the War Cabinet or for sir Eric Geddes&apos; meetings.&quot; In the event of Sir Eric Geddes desiring returns or information, or wishing to initiate proposals, the War Cabinet Secretariat will communicate with theDepartments concerned.&quot; In questions of emergency where the above procedure is too slow, theMinister concerned will apply to the War Cabinet and the question will be dealtwith on the above principles, but in a less formal way.&quot; In order to facilitate and expedite the transaction of business, Sir eric geddes has appointed as his assistants Sir Pobert Home, Sir Rhys Williams,Mr. Morz, and Lieutenant-Colonel McLellan, Major-General Sir Philip Nash,with Mr. R. P. Dunnell as Secretary, and Lieutenant-Colonel J. G. Beharrellas Statistician. These officers are authorised to keep in touch with and consultofficers in the various Departments in an informal way, but will give no directions of any sort.&quot;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.6th January, 1919.o
