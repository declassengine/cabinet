Housing Bill. 1. With reference to War Cabinet 518, Minute 4, the. War/Cabinet had under consideration a draft of a Bill to amend the enactments relating to the Housing of the Working Classes,accompanied by a Memorandum from the President of the LocalGovernment Board (Paper G.T.-6911).The President of the Board of Education encmired whether theBill gave sufficient power to clear out slum districts. For example,in the case of Sheffield, where there were 16,000 back-to-backhouses in a deplorable condition, the most ambitious scheme yetproposed by the local authorities was for no more than 500 additionalhouses. Did the Bill impose upon the local authority the duty ofdealing with a big slum problem upon an adequate scale ?The Parliamentary Secretary of the Local Government Boardpointed out that clause 5 of the Bill gave the Local GovernmentBoard power to carry out a scheme if the local authority were indefault.Mr. Symonds pointed out that the Local Government Boardcould lay down a time within which the local authority must take action, and could themselves take action, if the local authority failedto act within that time.The Prime Minister asked whether there was any machineryfor surveying the needs of the community in order to ascertain how many houses were needed in a given area. It was useless to rely onthe local authorities, who, it was certain, would estimate their needs- on an inadequate scale. Some means of seeing that these localestimates were adequate should be devised.Mr. Symonds stated that the provision in clause 1, by which itwas the duty of a local authority to consider the needs of their area, would be supplemented by the machinery which the LocalGovernment Board proposed to set up. Housing Commissionerswould be appointed, whose first duty it would be to consult with thelocal authority in the housing area.Major Astor explained that the country would be divided intoeleven areas, in each of which a Housing Commissioner would beappointed, with the necessary technical staff. They would be menof standing, and the Local Government Board hoped that through them they would be able to stimulate the local authorities andalso be able to give speedy assistance to those ,local authorities who wished to go ahead rapidly with their schemes. The Local Govern-ment Board would take the responsibility of verifying, through theirCommissioners, the accuracy of the housing estimates given by thelocal authorities.Mr. Barnes enquired why so long a time as six months after thepassing of the Bill was allowed under clause 1 (1) before the localauthority need submit a scheme.Major Astor replied that it was not necessary to wait for theBill; action had already been taken to stimulate the local autho-rities. They had abundant evidence that the financial assistancenow offered in the Bill would be a real inducement to local autho-rities to take action at once. In the past the financial inducementhad not been adequate.The Prime Minister remarked that, as the local authorities hadalready been circularised for some time, six months seemed to beunnecessarily long.The War Cabinet decided That the words &quot;six months&quot; in line 5 of clause 1 (1) shouldbe altered to &quot; three months.&quot;The First Commissioner of Works drew attention to clause 1 (3),and enquired whether, in the event of a scheme not being adequate,there was any power to compel the local authority to submit anadequate scheme. The Local Government Board had power to actin default of any scheme, but there did not appear to be sufficientprovision for compelling local authorities to make their schemesadequate to the needs of their areas.
Mr. Symonds suggested that clause 1 (3), which enabled theLocal Government Board to confirm a scheme, subject to such modifications as they thought fit, and to make the scheme as modified binding on the local authority, would meet this difficulty.The Prime Minister suggested that this would not enable theLocal Government Board to substitute 13,000 houses in a scheme if only 500 had been provided.The Home Secretary and the Secretary for Scotland agreedthat the words of clause 1 (3) were not strong enough to justifysuch an extension of a scheme by the Local Government Board.The War Cabinet decided That clause 1 (3) should be amended to provide that where, inthe opinion of the Local Government Board, the schemewas not adequate or suitable, the Local GovernmentBoard should be empowered to compel the local authorityto prepare an adequate scheme.The Prime Minister suggested that the Plousing commissioners and the Local Government Board should meet the ElectricityCommissioners, to be appointed under the Electricity Supply Bill,and the officials of the, proposed Ministry of Ways and Communica-tions, and colder with them on the relation of interurban andsuburban transport to the proposed housing schemes and areas.Mr. Fisher suggested that it was important to know whether there was a sufficient amount of building material available at themoment to meet the needs of the community solely by the building of new houses. He was of opinion that a great deal of work couldbe done by repairing, for example, in Sheffield.Mr. Barnes pointed out that if back-to-back houses were altered by breaking down the intervening wall, thus making two houses intosingle houses, half the population would have to be evicted.Mr. Bonar Law considered it was necessary to concentrate on building bouses outside the cities, linked up by tramways. Thedifficulty was that if an authority built outside its own area it hadno control and no rates.The Prime Minister agreed that this was a fundamentaldifficulty. Town Councils were disinclined to develop housesoutside their own area. They must be compelled to face theproblem of dispersing their workmen and of turning the townsmore and more into workshops and offices.Major Astor pointed out that there was power under the Billto compel two authorities to combine on a scheme.Mr. Symonds drew attention, in this connection, to the case of manchester, where under a scheme now being considered onlysixty-four houses were to be built inside the chvy and 4,000 outside.Sir Auckland Geddes said that he was not convinced that therewas a sufficient central organisation for securing that houses would be built in new localities. There was no powerful organisation to survey the country as a whole. It was necessary to get a thoroughdecentralised survey, which would entail much closer enquiry thanthe eleven Commissioners could undertake. This was particularly important in agricultural areas, where the local authorities werefrequently quite incompetent. It would be impossible for the elevenCommissioners to go minutely into all these areas. The developmentof some thinking machine, in addition to the Commissioners, wasnecessary.Major Astor observed that the Local Government Board intendedto develop town-planning on a big scale, partly through Sub-Com-missioners and partly through the County and Town Councils.Sir Auckland Geddes did not think that would provide thenecessary driving power, but probably the required organisationcould be set up administratively, provided a small authorising clausewere inserted in the Bill.   Power was required to set up a County[826] -299        . B 2
Committee, constituted partly from the County Council and partly from nominees of the Local Government Board, to survey the needsof the county.Mr. Bonar Law remarked that what the public really wanted toknow was what was going to be done at once.The Prime Minister said that  the same criticism applied as inthe case of the Land Settlement proposals.    The working classes &apos;would object that when buildings were required&apos; for the war theywere set up immediately, but under the Government proposals for housing successive periods of delay were involved.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that if the present Bill and theLand Acquisition and Land Settlement Bill were introduced, theywould be a sufficient indication that the Government meant business.He feared that the County Councils might object to havingGovernment nominees on the County Committees.It was pointed out that there were already precedents for this in the Agricultural Committees, and that as the State were payingeverything above a Id. rate they were entitled to be represented.The War Cabinet decided That the Parliamentary Secretary to the Local GovernmentBoard should confer with representatives of various county and Town Councils at present in London, and enquire whether the proposal to nominate representatives of-theBoard on Committees of the County and Town Councils,as proposed by Sir Auckland Geddes, would meet withacceptance.Mr. Barnes drew attention to clause 27, by which a pmblieutility society would be enabled to pa3r a dividend at the rate of6 per cent, per annum, instead of 5 per cent, as hitherto, and askedwhether this would not encourage the formation of new societies in opposition to the existing industrial societies.Mr.   Symoncls   replied   that   the   clause   was   intended   toenable existing societies which build houses for to pay 6 per cent., as well as the new societies.The War Cabinet decided the working classes(a.) To accept the Bill in jmnciple, an(j to refer it for thesettlement of details to a Committee composed of The  President  of   the   Local  Government  Board(Chairman).Dr. H. A. L. Fisher.Major Astor.Sir Auckland Geddes.Sir Alfred Mond.Mr. Munro.Mr. Stanley Baldwin.Mr. James Parker.Mr. G. M. Evans (Secretary).(b.) That the Bill need not again be referred to the WarCabinet unless any member of the Committee desiredto raise a matter of importance for their consideration.Committee on land acquisition and Land Settle-in en t Bills.2. With reference to War Cabinet 539,Cabinet decided Minute 1, the war to invite the Lord Chancellor to be Chairman, and the Attorney-General to be Vice-Chairman, of the Committee appointedto consider the Land Acquisition and Land SettlementBills.
Irish Prisoners. 4. With reference to War Cabinet 527, Minute 2, the AVarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chief Secretary(Paper G.T.-6906), and a. Memorandum by the Lord-Lieutenant(Paper G.T.-6912) urging that the time had come to sanction theimmediate release of Sinn Fein prisoners.The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that when the matter had been last before the Cabinet his recommendations had not beenaccepted, for two reasons : first, that a very serious strike was taking place, and the Government feared that the release of thoseprisoners at that moment might be regarded as an act of weakness ;and, second, because the Cabinet wished to be clearly informed ofthe reasons that had induced the Lord-Lieutenant recently to changehis view as to the policy to be adopted. There were two classes ofprisoners, the internees in Great Britain and convicted prisoners whowere interned in Ireland. Pie himself had just returned from thelatter country, where he had consulted a large number of peonle asto what should be done with these prisoners, and he was satisfiedthat responsible opinion was unanimous in favour of their release.The North of Ireland was not much interested in the question, andso far had expressed no opinion one way or the other.In reply to a question as to whether it would, not be better to wait until peace preliminaries were signed, Mr. Macpherson urgedthat the circumstances brooked no delay.The First Lord of the Admiralty expressed the hope that if itwas decided to release the men it should be done as inostentatiouslyas possible. When he had been Chief Secretary he had arranged that political prisoners should be sent to their homes without anydemonstration. He suggested that it might be as well not to differ-entiate in favour of Irish political internees : but that, if the cabinet decided to endo se the recommendations of the Government of Ireland,a certain number of British-born and other political prisoners whowere British subjects interned in this country should be simul-taneously liberated.The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that if the Cabinet decided on these mens release he would ask to have power to revive part ofthe Crimes Act. He would also like to increase the number ofresident magistrates.The First Lord of&apos; tha Admiralty said that when Mr. Asquithwas head of the Government, the question of reviving section 63 ofthe Crimes Act had been discussed, and the then Attorney-Generalbad been requested to draft a Bill which would give the Chief* Secretary the powers granted by section 63.It was suggested that if the convicted prisoners in Ireland wereliberated because their defiance of discipline made them an intolerablenuisance to the prison authorities it would have a very bad effect.It might be better, in some circumstances it would be preferable, tobring them across to interned camps in the United Kingdom.The Chief Secretary pointed out that there were various diffi-culties in the way of this, among which was the fact that if a manwas convicted by a resident magistrate in Ireland he had to stay inthat country.The Home Secretary said that if it were decided to release the sinn Fein prisoners he would propose to give Bowen Colt hurstunconditional release at the same time.   Colthurst was anxious to goLand Settlement 3. The War Cabinet decided that Bill,The Land Settlement Facilities Bill, which has been referred tothe above Committee under War Cabinet 539, Minute 2,need not again be referred to the War Cabinet unless anymember of the Committee desired to raise a matter ofimportance for their consideration.
to British Columbia, and he thought permission for him to do this might conveniently be given. At present he was confined to GreatBritain.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the Chief Secretary gradually to release Sinn Feinprisoners now interned in England.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 4, 1919.
