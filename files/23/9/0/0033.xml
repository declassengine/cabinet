The Railway Situa- 1. The President of  the Board of Trade, referring to thetlon- negotiations which had been taking place between the railway executive and the Railway Trade Unions, said that the offer whichhad been authorised by the War Cabinet was that pre-war earningsto all men should be advanced by, roughly, 50 per cent. that amount would be deducted from their present war wage of 33a.,and the remainder of the war wage would increase or decrease on asliding scale corresponding to the increase or decrease in the costof living. It was expected that as a resident of this offer the war wagewould gradually decrease. When the cost of living reached a figureequivalent to 20 per cent, above the pre-war cost of living thescale would no longer operate, but would continue so long as it remained above that figure. In the programme put forward by thetwo unions there were other demands in addition to the question ofwages, viz., extra pay for overtime, night work, and Sundays, andarrangements for pensions and annual holidays, which would in theaggregate represent a large sum of money. Some of these matters had never really been discussed with the men, because the Board ofTrade had first to settle with them the principle as to thecontinuance and permanence of the war wage. The Board had suggested that if the men wanted overtime for Sunday and nightwork, and other extras, there would be no objection, provided thatthe cost should be deducted from the 50 per cent.The offer had been considered by the two unions. Mr. J. H.Thomas had taken it to a fuU meeting of the delegates, who alone had authority to decide. They refused to accept the offer on principle,apart from the question of the exact percentage of the advance.They were not willing to agree that a part of the war wage onlyshould be made permanent, and the remainder dependent on thecost of living, and insisted on their full programme. The cost ofthe full programme would be at least 120,000,0001. above thepre-war cost of operating the railways. The present war wage wascosting, roughly, 60,000,0OOL The position was complicated bythe fact, which emerged at every stage of the proceedings, that assoon as a position was accepted by the National Union of Railwaymenit was rejected by the other union. In the present instance theAssociation of Locomotive Drivers and Firemen demanded that thenegotiations should continue, because the offer was more favourablein its operation to their Society than to the National Union of railwaymen, owing to the fact that the Association of LocomotiveDrivers contained a much higher percentage of high-grade men.The position being that one union wished the negotiations onthe above basis to continue and the other did not, it was necessaryto consider, not only the relations between the two unions, but alsowhat was to be the final offer of the Government, in view of theCabinet decision that, if the offer authorised by them failed, theBoard of Trade were to come back to the Cabinet for further instructions (W.C. 53(1, Minute 2).Criticisms had been made in the press of the secrecy whichhad been maintained. He desired to point out that the secrecy was due to the fact that there had only been negotiations, and no finaloffer had been made. He agreed that when an offer was made theremust be the fullest possible publicity both as to the demands of themen and the final offer of the Government and the cost in each case.- Mr. J. H. Thomas was holding a meeting to-morrow when theGovernment offer would be considered, to be followed on Fridayevening by a meeting of the Triple Alliance, when a joint decisionof the three unions would be taken. On the other hand, theAssociation of Locomotive Drivers was not a member of the triple alliance, and there was, therefore, a strong probability that,assuming arrangements could he made with Mr. J. H. Thomas thatwould stand the final test of the Triple Alliance, there might stillbe a railway strike owing to. &quot;the fact that the Association of locomotive Drivers containing a large percentage of the higher
grade men was powerful enough to hold up the whole railway system. The offer of the Government had not heen put in a final form, and was open to amendment and further consideration.Sir Herbert Walker interposed that the offer had never beenput in the shape of a firm offer of 50 per cent, on the men&apos;s pre-warearnings. The figure of 50 per cent, had only been mentioned onMonday last.The President of the Board of Trade said that Mr. Thomas had given no indication of an acceptable policy, but, on the other hand,Mr. Bromley had told the Board of Trade when they were proceeding on the right lines.The Minister Of Labour said that he was certain that the news-papers would be entirely against the Government unless it wasdisclosed that the Government had attempted to make a fair offer tothe railwaymen. At the present time nothing definite had been done,and the public were entirely unaware of the particulars of the controversy between the railway managers and the men. Some ofthe demands of the men were so exorbitant that prtblic opinion would be unanimously behind the Government. For instance, onedemand was thai the wages of all men in a grade shall be raised tothe highest in that grade That would mean that a man in a countrysignal-box with a large amount of leisure time would get the samewages as a man at a busy London terminus. If the case wereproperly slated the Government were sure of popular sympathy,and an offer should be made to-morrow with a full statement in the newspapers of the offer and of the railwaymen&apos;s demands.The President of the Board of Trade said he thought it wouldbe a mistake to allow it to be published thai the terms which were suggested during negotiations were really the final offer of theGovernment, because that was not the case.Sir Herbert Walker said it would be useless to advance theoffer of 50 per cent, to LOO per cent, ; it was the form of the offer which was objected to.   Some other formula must be adopted.All&apos;. Bonar Law asked what further form was suggested the President of the Board of Trade said that he was relying on public opinion, and therefore the offer should be as generous aspossible, and should go a little further than in ordinary circurn-stances. There was a limit, but it was worth while payingsomething to avoid the threatening catastrophe. In addition, therehad been a forecast that the Coal Commission enquiry would givesomething more to the miners, which in its turn would affect the railwaymen and the prestige of the railway leaders who were trying to bring the railway question to the front, and to prevent its beingoverclouded by the coal enquiry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that Sir HerbertWalker s statement that the alleged offer was not really an offer andthat it could not be made in that form with any hope of success, wasall that the Cabinet had before them. He would like to know whatwas now proposed by the Board of Trade and the Railway Executive.The President of the Board of Trade said he was not quite in accord with, the Railway Executive as to the offer which should bemade. There was nothing to guide them and it was mainly a matterof instinct. It was in no way a commercial proposition, because in any event a burden would be placed on the railway bigger thanthey were able to support. His own view was that the terms alreadyproposed should be supplemented, though he was unable to say thatit would be acceptable to the Union.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that there should be a meeting that afternoon between Sir Eric Geddes, Sir Albert Stanley, and sir robert Home, and the representatives of the Railway Executive, toexamine the question and to make recommendations to the Cabinet,and in the event of disagreement, to place a clear issue before theCabinet for decision.Sir A. Butterworth said that there were two difficulties (1) the[825]-387 &apos; B 2 ,
Railway Executive did not know how far the War Cabinet would authorise them to go with regard to money over and above the pre-war wages Bill (2) the Railway Executive had no idea of thedirection in which the National Union leaders thought that peacemight be found. The offer might differ materially, according as the attempt was made on the one hand to get the support of the public,and on the other hand to try and arrive at an agreement with themen.The Minister of Labour was certain that the demands of the men would be very elusive, and thought that if the coal miners would notstrike the railwaymen would continue their negotiations, but if thecoal miners struck the railwaymen would strike also. The pointtherefore, was to put forward an offer that would appeal to the public as a fair one. The railwaymen were afraid of the prospect of anearly reduction of wages, and he thought that it wrould make a very good start in relation to the negotiations with them if the cabinet were prepared to say (as recommended by a Committee of theIndustrial Conference) that the Wages Regulation Act should becontinued for a further six months from May next.Sir Eric Geddes said that he saw no advantage in the meetingsuggested unless there was to be some guidance from the Cabinet asto how far they were prepared to go. They must have some guidingfactor to assist them in arriving at a decision, but they would endeavour to obtain a clear statistical statement as to the demandsof the men and their relation to the cost of living, and the rates ofwages prevailing in other trades. The Committee could preparesuch a statement which would give assistance to the Cabinet in arriving at a decision. He was not at present sufficiently informed of the facts to say that it was necessary to make any further offerthan that which had been suggested.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that it would bepossible to say in the Press that the taxpayer was already bearing the burden of. the extra cost of the railways&apos;, and that any additional burden will fall on the taxpayer.The War Cabinet decided -(1.) That a Committee should meet that afternoon consisting ofSir Eric Geddes Sir Albert Stanley, and Sir robert home, in order to determine the offer which theGovernment should make to the railwaymen, and toreport their decision for consideration at a meeting ofthe Cabinet the same evening.      ,(2.) That the Committee in framing their report should state the cost of the proposals and their effect on the railwaybudget for the coming year.2. The Secretary of State for War 3-raised the question of the mechanical Transport Depot at Slough, which was in process of completion, and had been intended by the War Office as a generaldepot for the accommodation of army motor vehicles. The con-struction and purpose of the depot had been the subject of aconsiderable amount of adverse criticism in a certain section of thepress, and the matter was to be raised in Parliament.After a brief discussion the War Cabinet decided : (a.) That the question of the retention and disposal of thedepot should be settled by the Secretary of State forWar, in consultation with the Minister of Supply.(6.) To authorise the Secretary of State for War in the eventof Parliament pressing for an enquiry, to give an under-taking on the part of the Government that a committeewould be appointed for the purpose.(c.) That in the meantime the work should proceed.Mechanical Trans-port Depot atSlough.
Heligoland. 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Foreign office telegram from Mr. Balfour, iSo. 512, Astoria, of the 17th March, inwhich it was stated that the question of Heligoland had been underdiscussion by the Supreme War Council in connection with the navalterms of peace, that the Prime Minister had asked that the matter should be reserved for further consideration, and that he desired that the whole question of Heligoland should be examined by theWar Cabinet.The First Lord of the Admiralty submitted a Memorandum(G.T.-7004), in which the views of the Admiralty were set out.The War Cabinet decided That the Admiralty, in consultation with the War Office andthe Air Ministry, should have authority to advise theBritish delegates on the Supreme War Council, on behalfof the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 19, 1919.Land Acquisition 3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report of theBil1, Committee on the Land Acquisition Bill, G.T.-6988, together withthe Minutes of the 4th Meeting of that Committee, G.T.-6988 a, anda copy of the final draft of the Bill, G.T.-6910 a.The Lord Chancellor stated that the Committee had had two questions of importance under consideration : (1) as to whetherofficial valuers appointed under the Act should be allowed tocontinue in private practice ; and (2) whether the parties to arbitration proceedings should be represented as of right by counsel, or whether counsel should only be allowed with the consentof the official valuer.As regards the first point, on the suggestion of the PrimeMinister that the Committee should restrict themselves to questionsof policy as apart from the question of expense, the Committee hadreversed their original decision that official valuers should beallowed to continue in private practice. They were of opinion thata large salary would have to be paid to secure men of the eminenceand integrity necessary to command public confidence, but they werein agreement with the Prime Minister that such men must beemployed for their whole time upon the work in order to avoid theimpropriety of the same valuers making valuations at one time forthe Government and at another time advising clients privately onvaluation proceedings to which the Government were parties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was no question that good valuers must be obtained, and he was prepared to agreethat valuers should be precluded from private practice and emploj7edfor the whole of their time on Government work.The Lord Chancellor said, with regard to the representation ofthe parties by counsel, that the Committee had come to theconclusion after some discussion that, provided there were competentvaluers wdth power to give leave to have counsel in proper cases,counsel might be excluded in ordinary cases. It was hoped that, asthe result of this, short businessdike proceedings would be sub-stituted for the protracted discussion of technical points.The War Cabinet decided To approve the Land Acquisition Bill.
