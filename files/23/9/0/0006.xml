Increased Supply 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 501, Minute 9, the war of Beer. Cabinet had before tliem the following memoranda relating to theincreased supply of beer  Memorandum by Mr. Clynes (Paper G.T.-6262).Memorandum by the Central Control - Board (Liquor Traffic)(Paper G.T.-6281).Memorandum by the Shipping Controller (Paper G.T.-6388).Memorandum by Mr. Clynes (Paper G.T.-6444).Prices of Beer (Paper G.T.-G503).Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-6675).The Food Controller, in his Memorandum (Paper G.T.-6675),recommended : (a.) An increase in the present statutory barrelage of 25 per cent.;(6.) An increase of 2D on the average gravity at which brewersmay brew their total permitted output;(c.) A comprehensive revision of retail prices.- Mr. Bonar Law said that he was in favour of an increase in quantity, and also some reduction in the price. There was no doubtthat many people attributed the present industrial unrest to the lack and poor quality of beer. He suggested that the best way ofdealing with this question was to permit an increase of supply,make a slight reduction in price, and inform the brewers that in thenext Budget their taxation would be made heavier.Sir Walter Roffev said that although there were difficulties inthe way of Mr. Bonar Law-&apos;s proposal, they were not insurmountable,but it would take some little time to make the necessary arrange-ments. The proposed increase of 25 per cent, on the quantity meant10s. per standard barrel extra profit to the brewers. The totalstandard barrelage was 14,000,000. With regard to whisky, theBoard of Customs and Excise now released it from bond at 50 percent, of the 1916 issues. In his opinion it would not have any effectif the rate of release were increased by 10 per cent, or more, owing tothe fact that the middleman prevented the whisky reaching theconsumer. This was done by the trade in order to guard their interests and profits over the next two or three years.Major Astor stated that, according to his calculation, which hadbeen coniirmed in the Ministry, the trade would still be making a profit of between 7s and 82 per cent, under the proposed retail prices, after meeting all costs of production and distribution.Sir J. C. Sykes said that Lord d&apos;Abernon, who was unabjeto be present, was in favour of increasing the supply of light beer,and was of the opinion that the revenue from the trade could be considerably increased.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he would immediatelyinstruct Sir John Bradbury to consult with the Board of Customs and excise with regard to the reduction in the price from the standpointof the revenue and the forthcoming Budget.The Secretary for Scotland said that there would probably be anoutcry from the tempei ance.party in Scotland, but the political effect,in his judgment, would not be serious. The question of an-increasedsupply of&quot; beer was more an English problem than a Scottish one.f!Sir Robert Home said that a good deal of irritation on the clyde was due to the lack ot beer and the bad quality of thatobtainable.Mr. Roberts said that a substantial reduction in the price andan increase in the supply would have a good effect on public opinion,and do much to allay the prevailing industrial unrest.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To increase the present statutory barrelage of beer by25 per cent. ;(6.) To increase by 20 the average gravity at which brewersmay brew their total permitted output;
Pay of Army ofOccupation :Inter-Depart-mental Committee.2. The War Cabinet approved the appointment of an Inter-Departmental Committee, composed as under, to consider the pro-posals of the Army Council on the extra emolument of the army of Occupation and the effect of those proposals on the BoyalNavy :  nThe Right Hon. Sir L. Worthington Evans (GJiairman),  &apos;Mr. Stanley Baldwin, M.P.,The Right Hon. Sir Robert Chalmers, G.C.B.,The Right Hon. T. J fvlacnamara, M.P.,The Right Hon. H. W. Forster, M.P.,Major-General the Right Hon. J. E. B. Seely, C.B., C.M.G.,.D.S.O., M.P.,Lieutenant-General Sir H. V. Cox, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., C.S.I.,Lieutenant G. M. Evans (Secretary),together with one additional representative of the War Office andone additional representative of the Admiralty.Situation in 3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had  beenSomaliland. rather disturbed by the contents of one or two recent telegrams which had been received from Somaliland, and he had spoken tothe late Secretary of State for War on the subject. There appearedto him to be a possibility of General Hoskins becoming involved in military operations.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatSomnliland was not now under the Foreign Office, as it had beentransferred to the Colonial Office some years previously. he himself shared the Chancellors, apprehensions, and had written tothe Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressing the hope thatthere was no likelihood of our being involved in any way. general wilson had replied saying that the War Office had no intention of allowing themselves to be committed to military operations in that part of the world. ;The War Cabinet agreed that it was most undesirable that weshould become involved in any military activities in Somaliland, and decided  To instruct the War Office to inform our military Commanderas to their views.The Secret Service.4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum on heSecret Service by the First Lord of the Admiralty-(Paper G.T.-6665),and also a memorandum by the Home Secretary on the same subject(Paper G.T.- 0096&quot;).&quot;dn the first Paper Mr. Long had recorded his view that thequestion of the Secret Service demanded immediate and very carefulconsideration by the War Cabinet. The present system was thatthe Secret Service work was divided between several diHerent offices.(c.) That the Treasury and the Board of Customs and Exciseshould immediately consult with the Ministry of food and agree upon a scale for the reduction in price ;(d.) That no public announcement with regard to the increasein the supply of beer should be made until the questionof price had been agreed upon, but that then a simul-taneous announcement should be made. The FoodController was, however, authorised to inform the brewers that the 25 per cent, increase in the bar relateand 2 degrees in the gravity were agreed upon as from&quot; the 1st January, 191.9.
The Admiralty and the War Office controlled their own secret service, and took such action as might be necessary; but in regardto the civilian side of the said Service there did not seem to beanybody whose duty it was to call the attention of the Cabinet to serious reports when such were made, or to see that the necessary steps were taken. He suggested that the civilian system should beplaced under a Director, who would be responsible to a Minister,preferably one without portfolio, who would be charged with theduty of receiving reports as soon as they were made and of takingor directing the necessary consequent action.In the second Papc-r the Home Secretary agreed with the FirstLord of the Adrniiahy that the becrer. Service was of very greatimportance, and briefly outlined the organisation of the Service sofar as the Hume Department was concerned. He saw, however,certain objections to the course suggested by the First Lord, hutowing to the fact that he had only recently taken over his duties,he did not feel in a position at present to criticise or to make suggestions himself.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that a Committee should be appointedat once, with a Cabinet Minister as Chairman, to go into the wholequestion, with a view fro co-ordinating the work done at present bythe various Departments, and suggested that Lord Curzon shouldbe asked to preside over this Committee.Lord Curzon said that, if his Colleagues desired it, he would undertake the duties of Chairman, as he understood that it wouldnot be necessary for the Committee to extend its enquiry over any considerable period of time. In his View what the Committee hadto find Out was : (a.) What was being done at present by the Secret Servicebranches of the.several Departments.(6.) How that work could best be co-ordinated with a view tothe   necessary action  being   taken with   the   utmostpromptitude.-&quot; He&quot;further pointed out that Secret Service work was also done bythe Foreign Office and the India Office.Sir Eric Geddes suggested that the new Ministry of Research -and Information would probably be interested in the matter.Mr. Lmig said that, under the present arrangements, it was practically impossible-for the head of one Department to comment on the work of the Secret Service section ot another Department.There must be some co-ordinating authority outside both Depart-meuts. The matter was of urgent importance in view of the dangerof Bolshevism, which he was sure was on the increase.The War Cabinet decided that  )&apos; :A Committee should be appointed at once, composed of The Home Secretary,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The; Secretary of State for War,The Chief Secretary for Ireland,under the&apos; Chairmanship of Lord Curzon, with power toi summon officials of the Departments to attend to give evidence when necessary, and if he thought it desirable to &quot;invite additional members to join the Committee ; theSecretary to the Committee to be appointed -by theSecretary of State for Home Affairs.Threatened Police 5. The Home Secretary said that his Department had receivedStrike. a number of resolutions from a meeting of the Police which&apos;had beenheld on the previous Sunday. A good many of these resolutionsdealt with disciplinary questions ^connected w-ith the Metropolitan
Police Force. One resolution, however, concerned the MidlandRailway Police, claiming an immediate enquiry into the case ofcertain men of that Force who had been dismissed, and demandingan answer by midnight on the following Monday. The danger wasthat, if this demand were not met, there was a strong probabdity of another Police strike, which would be a serious matter. Hesuggested that his Department should reply to the Police Union(which, he reminded the Cabinet, had been tacitly recognised as an existing entity by allowing the Police to join it) that, as this wasa case in which the Metropolitan Police were not concerned and thematter was a domestic one, it should be referred to the MidlandRailway authorities.Mr. Bonar Law said that, on his return from Paris early in theweek, he had seen the Chief of the Metropolitan Police, who did not anticipate any serious trouble so long as the Government wereprepared to act firmly and justly.The Secretary for Scotland stated that there was very con-siderable unrest among the Scottish Police. He had recentlyconsulted several of the Chief Constables of Scotland, and their reports had been distinctly disquieting. Ex-Inspector Syme had recently been up in the North stirring up trouble in Glasgow. the unrest was mainly due to the fact that the Police were confronted with the contrast between the great increments of wages granted tomunition workers and tramway employees, and the relatively small increases they themselves had received, although they were employedin important national work.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the action suggested by the Home Secretary inthe case of the Midland Railway Policemen.- (b.) That the Home Secretary and the Secretary for scotland should confer together as to the measures it might benecessary to take in the event of serious trouble,, threatening in the Police Forces of England and scotland.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.
