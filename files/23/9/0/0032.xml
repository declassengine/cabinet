He wished vigorously to protest, both against theinvidious position in which he was at present- placed, and alsoagainst the severity of these men&apos;s present treatment, to the con-tinuance of which his military advisers were strongly opposed. Onthe previous occasion, to which he had referred, he had particularly asked that the matter mightj be reconsidered without delay. the reluctance of the Government to fall in with his views was, he understood, due to a desire to get round a parliamentary situation..[826]-373
In Ms opinion too much importance had been attached to this allegedsituation.The First Lord of the Admiralty enquired whether, supposingthese men were released, the labour position might not become moreacute as they would be able to take up good employment to the prejudice of others who had served their country, but would not be demobilised for some time.Sir Auckland Geddes said that he thought this was unlikely tobe the case, owing to the comparatively insignificant numbers involved.Mr. Bonar Law said that he had gathered during his recent visit to Paris that there was strong hope that the peace prelimi-naries would be signed at a very early date ; and, in view of this,he suggested that the further consideration of the question should again be deferred for a brief period.The War Cabinet took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s Memo-randum, and decided That the  question of the  release of conscientious objectorsshould again be deferred for a further period of two weeks.Increase of Rent 2. The  War   Cabinet   had   before   them   a   MemorandumInteresTSric- (G.T.-6977) by the President of the Local Government Board,tionsi Bill asking for a decision as to which DejDartment was to be responsiblefor dealing with questions which arose under legislation regardingIncrease of Rent and Mortgage Interest Restriction.The President of the Local Government Board said that he didnot think the matter was one which properly fell within the juris-diction of the Local Government Board. The Board was concernedwith provision of houses for the working classes, and the legislationnow in question imposed neither powers nor duties on localauthorities. As the problems involved were chiefly connected withthe law, he suggested that the Home Office should be held responsible.The Secretary of State for the Home Department said that hehad not the machinery for carrying out the work, and he under-stood that the Local Government Board already possessed thenecessary qualified staff. Inasmuch as this matter had up to thepresent been chiefly dealt with at the Local Government Board, andthat the correspondence involved would gradually diminish, theWar Cabinet decided That the Local Government Board should still continue to dealwith questions arising under legislation regarding Increaseof Rent and Mortgage Interest Restriction.Aliens EestrictionBill.3. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of the AliensRestriction (Amendments) Bill, with a covering Memorandum by theHome Secretary (G.T.-6971).The War Cabinet decided To refer the Bill to the Home Affairs Committee for their early consideration.MetropolitanPolice.4. With reference to War Cabinet 544 (1), the Secretary ofState for the Home Department asked whether, as the War cabinet had decided not to recognise the Police Union, there was any objection to the Commissioner of Police stating this fact in his orders, which were printed and issued to the force.The War Cabinet offered no objection.
oHousing Bill, 5. The President of the Local Government Board stated that,owing to the early introduction of the Housing Bill, he would beglad if the War Cabinet would forthwith consider the recommenda-tion of the Committee on the Land Acquisition Bill (G.T.-6988),that clause 8 of the Housing Bill regarding the basis of compen-sation for the compulsory acquisition of slum property shordd be restored to the Housing Bill and not transferred to the LandAcquisition Bill, as decided by War Cabinet Minute 539 (1). Hehad no objection to the Committee&apos;s proposal that the clause inquestion should be incorporated in the Housing Bill.The War Cabinet took note of the recommendation of theCommittee on the Land Acquisition Bill in regard to clause 8 of theHousing Bill, and decided That clause 8 of the Housing Bill should not be transferred tothe Land Acquisition Bill.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,March 17, 1919.
