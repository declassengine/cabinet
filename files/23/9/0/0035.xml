The War Cabinet had before them the following reports : -Coal Industry Commission Act, 1919.Interim report by the Hon. Mr. Justice Sankey, G.B.E.(Chairman), Mr. Arthur Balfour, Sir Arthur Duckham, K.C.B.,M.I.C.E., and Sir Thomas Royden, Bart., M.P. ;-   Interim report by Messrs. R. W. Cooper, J. T. Forgie, andEvan Williams ;Report by Messrs. R. Smillie, Frank Hodges, and HerbertSmith, Sir Leo Chiozza Money, Messrs. R, H. Tawney, and SidneyWebb.The War Cabinet then discussed the report by the Chairmanof the Commission.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the position reallywas that the report could not be considered on its actual merits, butthe Cabinet possessed a report of an independent kind (Mr. JusticeSankey&apos;s), the rejection of which would put the Government[826] 403 B
completely in the wrong and make it impossible for them to fight astrike.Mr. Bonar Law said that he had received a letter from thePrime Minister on the whole situation. Mi&quot;. Bonar Law then read the letter to the Cabinet. He said that as soon as this letter wasreceived he had had the following remarks transmitted through the telephone to the Prime Minister : &quot; The following is the position about the labour trouble.We are having a Cabinet at 6 p.m., and what I propose, if theCabinet approve, is to make a statement in the House as soonas possible afterwards on the general situation : &quot; As regards transport workers, negotiations under thedirection and initiation of the Ministry of Labour have been going on, and employers have made offers which seem to mereasonable and which I hope will be accepted.&quot; As regards the railways, I hope to have a statement whichwill enable me to say, in effect, what the demands of the menare, give some idea of what the cost would be, and state what we have offered, which means an addition which cannot beestimated, but which may be as much as 15 millions. Ishall say also that, as has been already indicated, some additionin railway rates is inevitable, and these further concessions willmake that addition greater.&quot; As regards the miners, I shall give the substance of thethree reports : shall say that the Government intend to adoptSankey&apos;s report and to take all necessary steps to carry it out without delay.&quot; As regards nationalisation, I shall give extracts showing that nobody expected it to be decided now, and shall readSankey&apos;s own words about it, which are very good, and add that no Government could be responsible for making such achange without proper examination. I am to see Sankey at 4o&apos;clock to-day, and I propose to say to the House that I have his authority for stating that he would be prepared to give a reporton the subject of nationalisation within a given time probablytwo months.&quot; I shall then add that both miners and railwaymen areservants not of employers, but of the State ; that a strike wouldbe against the State, and that the State must win and must useall its power for that purpose, otherwise it worud be the end ofGovernment in this country.&quot;As regards your letter to me, I am largely in sympathy with it, but I do not agree about attaching strikefunds. This I shall propose to do by Order in Council underthe Defence of the Realm Regulations, which can be passed on saturday if we know that there is a strike.&quot; As regards arresting the leaders, and so on, I agree with you in thinking that that would not be a wise procedure to takenow, but I think it is quite possible that after the strike hasbroken out and we have public opinion, as I believe, entirely on our side, it would then be the right thing to introduce sucha Bill.&quot; It is quite possible that your absence may be criticised,and we may be asked whether there is anyone who is empowered-  to act with the authority of the Prime Minister in an emergency.I propose to say that I have full authority from you to act inthat way and shall so act.&quot;The reply of the Prime Minister to this communication wasthat he appproved of all the proposals. Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;sreport contained more than he (Mr. Bonar Law) had gathered fromthe account which had been given, to him of it on the previous day, when he had only been informed about the paragraphs relating
to nationalisation, hours, and wages. When he saw Mr. JusticeSankey to-day he dictated in his presence what he proposed to say we the House of Commons with regard to this report, andMr. Justice Sankey expressed his approval. Mr. Bonar Law pro-posed to make a statement on the following lines : Three reports have been issued.The first which I will refer to, is that of the Coal Masters.Their recommendation is an advance of Is. 6d. a day, and a redtic-tion to seven, instead of eight hours.There is a further report, signed by the three miners&apos; repre-sentatives, and the three gentlemen who were appointed to representLabour interests, which is, in effect, a recommendation of the fulldemands of the miners, including, of course, nationalisation.There is, finally, the report of the chairman, which has been signed also by three representatives of the employers&apos; interests,apart from the coalowners, and it is, of course, to this report that Ishall specially refer. Though brief, it is a very exhaustive report,and, I may add, contains also a very ambitious scheme for thewhole future dealing with this industry. As regards hours and wages, it recommends that there should be an immediate increasein wages of 2s., which is two-thirds of the full demands made bythe miners. As regards hours of labour, it recommends almost immediately, as soon as the arrangement can be made, that is onthe IGth July, that the hours shall be reduced from eight to seven,and, as regards a further reduction, I shall read the exact words inthe report: &quot; We recommend that the Coal Mines Regulation Act,190S, common! v called the Eight Hours Act, be amended by the substitution, in the clauses limiting the hours of work under-ground, of the word &apos; seven &apos; for the word &apos; eight,&apos; as and fromthe 16th July, 1919, and, subject to the economic position ofthe industry at the end of 1920, by the substitution of the word&apos; six &apos; for the word &apos; eight,&apos; as and from the 13th July, 1921.Certain adjustments must be made in the hours of the classesof underground workers specifically mentioned in the Act.&quot;It does not recommend nationalisation. On this point I cannot do better than read the exact words in that report: &quot; Even upon the evidence already given, the present-system of ownership and working in the coal industry stands con-demned, and some other system must be substituted for it, eithernationalisation or a method of unification by national purchase and/or by joint control. (X.) To some of our colleagues, whoseopinion we greatly value, nationalisation has been the study orambition of a lifetime, and they are prepared at once to reportin its favour. (XL) We understand that to others, whoseopinion we equally value, some scheme of joint control appearsto be a solution of the problem. (XII.) No detailed scheme fornationalisation has as yet been submitted to the Commissioners :nor has any scheme for joint control been placed before them.(XIII.) No sufficient evidence has as yet been tendered, and no sufficient criticism has as yet been made, to show whethernationalisation or a method of unification by national purchase and/or by joint control is best in the interests of the countryand its export trade, the workers, and the owners.&quot;As the House will know, the Chairman of the Commissionundertook to give a report on wages and hours by the 20th of thismonth. He has kept his promise, and the report will be availableto members when I sit down.As regards nationalisation, however, he recognised when theCommission was appointed that the report on such a question in soshort a time was impossible, and this view was not only taken by[826]-403 B 2
him hut by the whole House of Commons, as is evident by the debate, and by the whole of the public. It must indeed be evidentthat no Government and no House of Commons could possiblydecide a question of this kind which will affect the financial interestsof the whole community without a proper examination. On theother hand, I have seen Mr. Justice Sankey to-day, and he has givenme the same undertaking which he gave to the Prime Minister inregard to hours and wages that if the Commission continues hewill give a report on the principle of nationalisation by the 20th ofMay. On this subject the Government now, as when the discussion took place before, have a perfectly open mind, and the problemtherefore to be decided by the miners&apos; representatives is whether ornot, so far as this aspect is concerned, they are.willing to wait until a proper examination has taken place, or insist upon a decision now,when it is obvious to everyone that such a decision could only be takenby those who had prejudged the question and had made up their minds long before the Commission sat. But this is not the whole ofMr. Justice Sankey&apos;s Report. It proposes to deal in the meantimewith the whole coal industry on lines which are not altogetherdissimilar from those which in principle the House has accepted inregard to Ways and Communications. He recommends definitely that the men should have an effective voice in the direction of the mines.   In dealing with this, I shall read the exact words : &quot; (XV.) We are prepared, however, to report now that itis in the interests of the country that the colliery worker shallin the future have an effective voice in the direction of the mine. For a generation the colliery worker has been educatedsocially and technically. The result is a great national asset.Why not use it ? &quot;Beyond this, however, his proposal is that the commission should go on sitting and deal one by one with the possible means of economy and improvement in the working of the mines. If thisreport be adopted it will mean that interim reports will be issued at short intervals and that the recommendations for economy and improvement will be carried out at once. But these recommenda-tions will not merely be the action of a dictator or of the masters,but will be adopted after full evidence has been taken and the viewsof the men, as well as of the masters, have been heard in connectionwith it. This scheme involves the continuance of the coal control for at least a year, but it is by means of this coal control that immediate effect could be given to these recommendations. The coalcontrol would be continued for this further reason, that part of thereport is a definite recommendation that the profits of the coal ownersshould be limited to Is. 2d. a ton, and by means of coal controlalso, which is now treating the whole industry as a unit, it will bepossible to enable improvements, such as coal-cutting machinery, tobe adopted in mines in which, without some such arrangement, itwould be impossible to find the capital.This scheme will have the further advantage that theseproposals can be tried at once, and it can be judged to what extent they are successful, and before the period of coal control comes toan end all the proposals, just as in the case of the Ways and communications, will be focussed and carried into effect by an act of Parliament for this purpose. This seems to me one of the moststatesmanlike methods of dealing with the great problem which has ever been suggested.The Government are prepared and I now make the announce-ment on their behalf to adopt this recommendation in the spirit aswell as in the letter, but whether or not this scheme, which, asI have said, I regard as in the highest degree statesmanlike, depends upon the attitude of the miners now. Obviously if a strike takes place the Commission cannot continue to sit, and any possibility ofimprovement on these lines becomes impossible.   I do not disguise
from myself that the Government in taking this decision,, as again,in the case of Ways and Communications, are embarking on a veryambitious enterprise, but I am convinced that, in present circum-stances, it is an enterprise which they are justified in undertaking.As I have said, whether or not it can be tried depends now not uponthe Government, who are willing to try it, but upon the represen-tatives of the miners. It seems to me to give them an opportunityof putting their whole industry on the basis which at least holds outthe hope of having the willing work of all the men in this greatindustry to an extent which has not existed in the past, and in viewof the great advantage to the men of such a scheme, and of thefurther fact that as regards the immediate improvement of their conditions, they will receive 2s. advance in wages, which is equalto two-thirds of the demand, and the reduction of hours to which Ihave already referred, I cannot believe that the miners will refuseto allow this report to take effect, and if they do, I am certain ofthis that no more serious mistake has been or ever could be madeby those who have the best interests of the men at heart.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law said that it was a remarkable thing that thethree representatives of employers on the Commission who were notcoalowners had signed Air. Justice Sankey&apos;s report. AVhen theCommission started, it looked as if there would be a report by the six Labour representatives, another report by the six employers, anda further report by the chairman. The question for the Cabinet todecide was whether they would adopt Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s report.In his opinion there was no alternative.At this stage, the following message was received from thePrime Minister : &quot;I have just seen Section 9 of the Sankey report. In viewof that, your suggested statement on the subject of the futureof the mines seems to me to be inadequate and might justifylegitimate resentment on the part of the miners. All themembers of the Commission, except the coal-owners, condemnthe present system of ownership and working in the coalindustry, and 1 understand, privately, that the coal-owners agreewith this view, but as they will have to be parties to bargainingwith the Government, they do not wish to handicap themselves by any statement at this moment. In these circumstances, i suggest strongly that in your statement to-night you should call attention to this remarkable paragraph, and say that in view ofthis condemnation of existing conditions under which theindustry is conducted, it is essential in the national interests that the question should be further investigated by theCommission with a view to ascertaining what can be substitutedfor the present system, and that for so important a question thetime suggested by Mr. Justice Sankey for its investigation isnot unreasonable, and that you feel sure that the commission will come to that conclusion, and that although there has been sufficient evidence to condemn the system, evidence as to thesystem which should be substituted has not yet been given,and no sufficient opportunity has been afforded for submittingalternative proposals.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he thought Mr. bonar law might also make reference, in his statement, to the following paragraph in the report, on page 9 : &quot; The reason for considering the further reduction inJuly, 192Tq is that we think we are justified in assuming thatin two years the output should have reached, by the unitedefforts of all concerned, the amount of coal raised in 1913,namely, 287,000,000 tons.&quot;
The Minister of Labour then explained the position regardingthe railway negotiations. He said that a meeting was being heldat that moment, and had not yet concluded. All the terms whichthe Government proposed to offer to the railway men were being put before them, but the men&apos;s representatives had said that theywould be unable to give a decision upon them without referring totheir delegates.Mr. Bonar Law then said that he would refer, in his statement inthe House that evening, to the railway negotiations, to the effectthat these had been going on for the last few days, and that theGovernment had that day made a definite offer to the men&apos;s leaders,that it was not possible to give particulars of this at the moment,but that he hoped a statement would appear in the press on thefollowing morning.The Minister of Labour asked whether anything was to be said about the cost of the advances to the coal miners. The gross cost forthe New Year would be 43,000,0007. 39,000,0i )0l. of that represented the difference between the present rate of profit and 1*. 2d. Thepresent cost of coal would not be reduced, but the price would bemaintained at its present high artificial level. The miners would get the benefit of that. In addition, the present cost of coalcharged to neutrals was too high by 9,000,0001., which would also have to be found. Mr. Justice Sankey&apos;s view was ,that we . shouldsave 13,000,OOOL by economy in working. In effect, therefore, thebulk of the amount which now went to the Treasury in excessprofits would be transferred to the miners. If the miners&apos; demandshad been conceded in full, it would have cost the country68,000,000*.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that this calculation must be takensubject to the qualification that it was not proposed to continuethe Excess Profits Duty in its present form.The Secretary of State for War doubted whether the Govern-ment had gained anything by appointing the Coal Commission. Itwas not clear&apos;that a strike would be avoided. He did not think thecase for the Government and for the owners had been properlystated before the Commission, nor had there been any adequateinvestigation of the housing conditions in mining districts.The Minister of Education considered that the country would hold that the Sankey Report had given away the case againstnationalisation, and would regard it as a summing-up in favour of nationalisation.Mr. Bonar Law said that Mr. Justice Sankey was of opinionthat nationalisation was probably the proper course, but that it wasimpossible to state that as a definite policy as the result of onlyten days&apos; investigation. The Prime Minister was in agreement withthis view, and held that it was impossible for the Government tostultify themselves by making a declaration in favour of nationalisa-tion as the result of so short an enquiry.The War Cabinet approved the speech Mr. Bonar Law proposedto make in the House of Commons the same evening.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,March 21, 1919.
