Vote of Thanks toGeneral Smuts.Future of theEastern Com-mittee.1. THE Chancellor of.?the Exchequer said that he wished to propose to his colleagues that they should pass a formal vote of thanks to General Smuts, in recognition of his services and theassistance he had rendered in their deliberations during the time that he had been a member of the War Cabinet.TheWar Cabinetdirected thatMinutes.approved the Chancellors proposal,the decision should be   recordedinandthe2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by lord curzon (Paper G.T.-6619) on the future of the Eastern Committee,covering a decision of the Committee recommending to the Cabinetthat the Eastern Committee should be dissolved and that its work should be carried on by inter--Departmental Conferences to be sum-moned, when necessary, by Lord Curzon in his capacity as officiatinghead of the Foreign Department.The War Cabinet approved the decision of the Eastern Com-mittee.Number of officials from each Govern-ment Departmentto be Detailed forthe PeaceConference.3. Lord Curzon drew the attention of the War Cabinet to what he regarded as an absurdly large number of officials from the various departments who were proceeding to Paris in connection with thePeace Conference. The numbers from the Foreign Office were notless than 100 persons, including 5 of the principal officials and 60stenographers. Unless a considerable portion of these were returnedvery shortly the work of the Department was bound to break down.The fact that the numbers in every case were probably excessivehad already&apos; been commented upon at a meeting of the War Cabineton the 22nd November, 1918 (War Cabinet 506, Minute 4), when itwas decided to ask General Smuts to reduce the numbers, ifpossible.The War Cabinet decided that Departments should be asked to take the earliest opportunityof recalling to London any officials, clerical personnel, &amp;c,whose presence in Paris was not found to be absolutely necessary,and instructed The Secretary to take the necessary action.The Military Situa-tion in Eussia :fCensorship.4. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 48, Minute 2, theWar Cabinet had before them two Papers by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, one entitled &quot;North Russia&quot; (Paper G.T.-6589), andthe other &quot;The Military Situation in Siberia&quot; (Paper G.T.-6598).In the Paper &quot;f\&apos;orth Russia&quot; it was pointed out that the imperial war Cabinet had decided on the 31st December, 1918, that, while nodemobilisation measures were to be taken for the present,-no further reinforcements were to be ordered to Russia until the question couldbe dealt with in Paris. Since that decision General Maynard had represented that, if we were to maintain our present positions in the murmansk area, it was essential that railway and army personnel,amounting to a sum of 1,000 persons, should be despatched withoutdelay. The only alternative was a withdrawal at least to Kandalaksha.The matter was urgent and required an immediate decision.In the second Paper, &quot; The Military Situation in Siberia,&quot;General Wilson pointed out that the Americans and Japanese stillrefused to send any troops west of Lake Baikal. This meant thatwe were faced with the following alternatives : either we must provide additional troops from India, or elsewhere, to take the place
of the Canadian contingent in stipport of the two British battalionswe now had near Omsk, or we must withdraw these two battalionsfrom Siberia altogether. He himself recommended that these two battalions should now be withdrawn to Vladivostock and theCanadian forces sent back to Canada.General Wilson said that since the Paper was written there hadbeen signs of unrest in the Army at home, and it was notorious thatthe prospect of being sent to Russia was immensely unpopular. Theresult was that it was impossible for us to reinforce our troops in north Russia and Siberia. A further complication was that we had lately been having trouble with the Red Finns. Moreover, since the censorship over wireless messages had been abolished, the GeneralOfficersCommandingatMiirmanskand in Mesopotamia hadtelegraphedsaying that the Horsea wireless had announced that we proposed towithdraw our troops from Russia, and also about 90,000 or so from mesopotamia. These announcements were bound to give rise to agreat deal of disaffection, as the soldiers in Tndia, for instance, wouldcertainly feel that they were being badly treated. The only remedy,he thought, was to revive the censorship of wireless messages.Mr. Churchill said that he agreed with General Wilson that itwas necessary to resuscitate at once the censorship machinery, but it need not be established on such an extensive scale as it was before.The War Cabinet decided that The War Office, after consultation with the Foreign Office, theHome Office, and the Admiralty, should make definite pro-posals with a view to the re-establishment of censorshipover wireless communications, the War Office and Admiraltybeing empowered to take the necessary action if the fourDepartments were in agreement as to the course to be pursued.5. Lord Curzon asked for a decision of the Cabinet in regard to telegram No. 49, dated the 8th January, 1919, from Lord robert cecil, in Paris, which stated that Marshal Foch had impressed uponLord Robert the enormous importance of assisting Poland againstthe Bolsheviks. The Marshal had urged that it was to the interestof the Associated Governments to stop the advance of Bolshevismbefore it penetrated Austria and Germany ; that the associated governments not being able to intervene themselves with sufficientforce ought to organise as quickly as possible a Polish army ; that nothing could be done in this direction except by using the Danzig-Thorn Railway, which must first be occupied ; and that occupationcould not be carried out in sufficient strength without employing oneAmerican division, one French regiment, one British regiment, andone Italian regiment, the whole to be under an American General.Lord Robert in commenting on the MaxshaPs representations&apos; had said that the proposal was to send General Haller a Polish divisionby the above route. He had pointed out to the Marshal the difficultyof providing British troops, since our soldiers were only enlisted forwar against Germany, and he had suggested that it might makethings easier if the Americans made the proposal officially ; inconclusion, he had said to the Marshal that provided the militarydifficulty could be got over- he was, personally, warmly in favour ofthe proposal. Lord Curzon said that the situation in Poland was rapidly becoming dangerous. The military position, both to theEast and to the West, was precarious. Russian prisoners, as theyreturned, were turned into Bolshevik soldiers by a threat ofstarvation. Munitions were being freely supplied to the Bolsheviksby the Germans. In his opinion, unless the Associated governments could succeed in reorganising Poland, she might cease to exist in afew weeks. It was most urgent that those Governments should decide at once upon their joint policy in Russia. The.immediatepoint requiring the decision of the Cabinet was : were we to give
military assistance ? He himself was inclined to reply to lord robert Cecil that, while we could not ourselves make a military con-tribution, we would be glad to assist in any other way the furtherance of a joint policy. tie reminded the Cabinet that, in dealing withthe Russian problem, when applications were made to us for our aid,we always said that we would assist with money, munitions, &amp;c, and finally ended by offering to send volunteers. At present, however,he believed it was most unlikely that volunteers would be forthcoming.Mr. Churchill hoped that Lord Curzon was wrong in hissurmise about the volunteers. He himself felt it was quite impossiblefor us to stan 1 aside and let Poland go to pieces. There were twopropositions which they had to discuss (a.) What the Allied policy was to be in Russia; and(6.) How to supply the forces necessary to execute that policy.A statement had appeared in the press, he thought, to the effect thatno British troops were to be sent to Russia. He thought this was unfortunate, and that a corrected statement should be made to theeffect that no British troops would be sent to Russia unless theyvolunteered for that service. He suggested to the Cabinet that itmight be advisable to let Germany know that if she were preparedto organise her Eastern front against the ingress of Bolshevism, theAllied Governments would raise no objection. It was a matter for serious consideration whether we should not now decide to bolster upthe Central Powers, if necessary, in order to stem the tide of bolshevism.The Secretary reminded the Cabinet that at a Meetingof the Imperial War Cabinet on the 31st December, 1918(Imperial War Cabinet 48, Minute 3), it had been generally agreed that, in cases where there was an external aggression bythe Bolsheviks on an existing Government with which wehad been co-operating, we should be entitled to support that Govern-meut in any manner which did not involve military intervention,and that o .r general policy should be that, as Sir J. Cook expressedit, of &quot; willing off a fire in a mine.&quot;Lord ( urzon questioned whether the British delegates to thePeace Conference had any clear idea as to the policy the adoptio iof which they would advocate at the Conference. A number of papers by the General Staff, &amp;c, had been circulated to theCabinet, dealing with special aspects of what was one big problem.He suggested that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should bring these papers up to date and embidy their revised contents inone comprehensive paper for&apos; the use of our delegates. He thoughtthat until the Associated Governments had decided upon theirpolicy it would be premature and useless to send troops to Russia.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To instruct the Chief of the Imperial General Staff toprepare a comprehensive paper, on the lines suggestedby Lord Curzon, with the least possible delay.(6.) That it was essential that the British delegates to thePeace Conference should take the earliest possible opportunity, after their arrival in Paris, of raising thegeneral question of the policy to be adopted by the associated Governments in Russia.Russia:Supplies to theGreek Army.6: Lord Milner said that he wished to raise the question of our continuing our present supplies to the Greek Army. We had held a month ago a Conference with the Trench, and it had then beendecided to assemble an Anglo-French Financial Conference to decidefuture policy. This latter Conference had never been held. Mean-while, Greek divisions had gone to Odessa, apparently assuming.
Siberia. 7. With reference to Minute 4, the War Cabinet resumed thediscussion of the Paper by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff onSiberia (Paper G.T.-6598).Mr. Bonar Law said that the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff had recominende 1 that the two British battalions at or aboutOmsk should be withdrawn from Siberia altogether.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that this meant breaking faith with the French and the Czecho-Skvaks.Mr. Churchill deprecated the withdrawal of the two battalions,for, if they were taken away, the fabric we had been trying toconstruct would fall to pieces. The Czechs would go, Kolchak&apos;s army would disappear, anil the French would withdraw.The War Cabinet decided That the question of the withdrawal of the two british battalions to Vladivostock, and the return of the canadian troops to their own country, must await the decision of the associated Governments as to .their general policy iaRussia.Labour matters and the PeaceConference.[826] 308. The War Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum bythe Home Office and the Ministry of Labour (Paper P.-41) dealingwith the poLcy to be adopted by the Government at the PeaceCongress towards the demand of labour for an international agree-ment on labour questions.Lord Cave said that the Departments were in favour generallyof the principle of international agreements on subjects like hours and factory conditions, and, as it would be impossible for the PeaceConference to enter into detailed Discussion-sion of such subjects, it was proposed to recommend that a Committee of the Congress should beappointed to set up a permanent international organisation to dealwith labour questions. The matter had been discussed with lord robert Cecil, who was of the opinion that a very small number ofrepresentatives of each Government would suffice.Mr. Barnes suggested that the wording adopted in the jointmemorar-dum should be slightly amended, to show that the Oorn-mission was to be approved by the Congress, and not necessarily to consist of members of the Congress.that their supplies would continue to be forthcoming from theFrench and ourselves. General Milne had, on his own authority,promised this detachment fuod for ten duys and forage for twenty.He wished to know whether the Cabinet desired that these supplies should continue.Lord Ourzon pointed out that since the signing of the armisticeFrance had become responsible for the areas north of the Black Sea,among others, and that if she initiated operations there it was for her to find the funds.Mr. Churchill thought that we must continue our supplies tothe Greek Army until we had decided upon our general policy. Ithad been suggested that the Greek Army might be reduced by twoor three divisions. He thought this most unwise until we saw howthings were going to develop.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) For the present we should continue our supplies to theGreek Army.(b.) When the question of the policy of the Associated Govern-ments in Bussia was discussed in Paris, the Greek aspect of the problem should not be neglected.(c.) With reference to the decision previously taken (Minute5 (a)), in his comprehensive appreciation of the militarysituation in Russia, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should take into consideration the Grecian factor.
Go-operation bythe Royal AirForce in Russia.9. The War Cabinet had before them two memoranda by theAir Ministry (Papers G.T-6580 and G.T.-6581) in regard toco-operation by the Boyal Air Porce in Russia. In the memorandait was stated that 36 D.H.-4 aeroplanes &apos; were being prepared for despatch to Archangel. With regard to Murmansk, the admiralty had agreed to despatch a seaplane-carrier to Murmansk during the spring. It was intended to use the machines she would carry fromthe Gulf of Onega and the lakes adjoining the Murmansk-PetrogradRailway. It would be necessary that any Royal Air Force personnelordered to North Russia should be volunteers, and arrangements were being made accoi dingly. As regards Vladivostock and SouthernRussia, the Air Council were prepared tosuppiy 100 aeroplanes, whichmight be used to assist the pro-Ally Russian forces based on vladivostock-vladivostock or operating in Southern Russia.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that thesame considerations which had been mentioned in regard to themilitary situation in Siberia, referred to in Minutes 4 and 7, appliedequally to 1 his question of co-operation by the Royal Air Force.The War Cabinet decided that The decision on questions raised in the memoranda by the AirMinistry should be postponed until alter the discussions at paris on the policy to be adopted b)r the Associated Govern-ments in Russia. In the meanwhile, no aerial forces wereto be sent to Russia or the Caspian.Aerial NavigationBill, 1919.10. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (Paper G.T.-6696) covering a draft Billto make temporary provision for the regulation of aerial navigation.Subject to Mr. Barnes&apos;s amendment, the War Cabinet decided To approve the recommendations in the memorandum, namely : (a.) That at the Peace Conference the British Governmentshould make a proposal to the following effect: That a Commission approved by the Congress beappointed to enquire into the question of the internationaladjustment of conditions of employment, and to consider what forms of permanent international machinery shouldbe established to enable the several countries to securejoint action on matters affecting. conditions of employ-ment, and to recommend what steps should be taken toset up an appropriate organisation ;(6.) That the representation of Efis Majesty&apos;s Government onthe Commission should consist of one representative ofthe Hume Office and one representative of the Ministryof Labour, and that no additional repi esentatives shouldbe appointed without Cabinet sanction.(Mr. Roberts and Sir David Shachleton arrived at the Meeting afterthe above decision had been reached.)Sir David Shackleton stated that, v\ hen the International Corn-mission was in session, it would be useful if there were also available,not as delegates hut in a consultative capacity, representatives of organisations of employers and employed.As immediate action was not involved, the War Cabinet took no decision on this point.
Demobilisation ofthe Royal AirForce.11. With reference to War Cabinet 514, Minute 8. the WarCabinet had before them three memoranda by the Air Ministry(Papers D.M.-2, G.T.-6478, and G.T.-6591).Lord Weir said that he thought be had made it clear at theprevious Cabinet (War Cabinet 5L4, Minute 8) that it was impos-sible to proceed with the problem of demobilisation until he had obtained a decision from the War Cabinet, as to the future strengthof the Royal Air Force, nor was it possible at present to take anyintelligent decisions on the subject. In his memorandum onthe future of the Air Force (Paper G.T.-t)59l) he asked that lieshould be immediately authorised to demobilise the Air Force downto the personnel of 75.000 of all ranks, and to offer permanent commisions to the. requisite number of officers.Mr. Churchill pointed out that the future strength of the RoyalAir Force, must necessarily proceed par/ passu with the Army move-ment. At present the Royal Air Force could offer no permanentengagement, and, pending a decision on the question, the personnel of the Air Force were just the kind of men who would leave the AirForce and obtain employment in civil life. Mr. Churchill added that,with regard to Lord Weir&apos;s suggestion to demobilise down to a givenfigure, and at the same time recruit up to that figure on a permanent basis, it would be unwise to open the-exit doors before the entranceswere open,arrived at that dav.Lord Weir said that he knewr he was asking for a great deal,and was content with Mr. Churchill&apos;s suggestion, provided that theCabinet realised that no intelligent action was being or could betaken on the subject.In these circumstances the Cabinet reached no decision.He therefore suggested that no decision should be proposed Gift of destroyers and submarines to theAustralian Navy.12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFirst Sea Lord (Paper G.T.-6593) proposing a gift of destroyers and submarines to the Australian Navy.Lord Weir explained that this Bill empowered a Secretary ofState (who would be the Secretary of State for the Royal Air Force)to control all civilian flying in this country, by requiring a licence ineach case and compelling the licensee to conform to orders made by the Secretary of State under the Act. The orders would bepublished in the &quot; London Gazette&quot; and laid before Parliament,becoming operative, however, from the date of publication.Lord Weir said that an International G mference would be held inParis in the near future, which would draw up a Convention on thesubieot of safeguards in connection with aviation, and pending theresult of that Conference which could not be for four or five months-this draft Bid had been prepared. He urged that thematter should receive the consideration of the War Cabinet, and that steps should be taken to press the suggested Bill through parliament at the opening of the new session.Mr. Bonar Law expressed the opinion that, as civil flying was prohibited under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, so perhapsit might be licensed under the same regulations. He, therefore,suggt sted that the Law Officers should be consulted on this point,having; regard to the inconvenience of introducing a small Bid suchas that proposed.The War Cabinet requested Lord Weir to consult with the Law Officers of the Crown as towhether licences to control civilian flying in this country could be issued under existing&apos; powers. If fresh legislation were unavoidable, Lord Weir should bring the questionback to the War Cabinet.
Oil Fuel Reserve. 13. The War Cabinet had before them an Admiralty memo-randum (Paper G.T.-6594) in regard to an Oil Fuel reserve for theNavy in Home Waters.Owing to the unavoidable absence of Mr. Long, the question was postponed for consideration at a later date.Disposal of War-Material on demobilisation...GovernmentPurchase of1911) Flax Crop.14. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-6582; in regardto the disposal of material on demobilisation, with a view to forming a war reserve.In his memorandum the Chief of the Imperial General staff stated that, prior to the war, reserves were held in the UnitedKingdom sufficient to maintain lor a noimal period of six months a force of 1 cavalry division, 6 infantry divisions, ami certain line of com-munication tioops. At the present time we were maintaining 75to 80 divisions and 8 cavalry divisions in vaiious theatres, and on demobilisation we should have large quantities of surplus stores. Inorder that arrangements might be made for their disposal, it was essential that the general policy should be settled on broad lines at anearly date. &apos;There wrere two questions involved : (a.) The distribution of existing war equipment; and(6.) The scale on which reserves were to be maintained in thefuture.It was pointed out that this question of selling material had better be postponed until something more definite was known asregards the conditions of peace.The War Cabinet decided that Instructions should be given to the Ministry of Supply not to dispose of war material without consultation with the WarOffice.15. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChief Secretary for Ireland (Paper G.T.-6570j relating to .thequestion of the Government purchase of the L91U flax cropThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of the large stocks of linen now in Belfast, the question would need very close examination before the Government could consent to the expenditureof 1,500,000/,., as proposed by the Chief Secretary, and be suggestedthat the question should be adjourned until the new Govermtnt hadbeen formed and the new Ministers had had time to siudj&apos; thequestion.-li Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January 10, 191&apos;J.In his memorandum, the First Sea Lord stated that the mannerin which the war had ended made it quite practicable to spare somedestroyers and submarines as a gift to the Australian Navy. In viewof the fine part which Australia had played in the war, and particu-larly of the :eadiness with which she had accepted every Admiraltyrequest as to the employment of her ships, the Board of Admiraltysuggested that it would be desirable to make a free gift to her Navy of six modern destroyers and a flotilla of six submarines. The first sea Lord further proposed that two submarines now at Bermudashould be offered as a gift to the Canadian Government.Mr. Montagu pointed out that Lord Jellicoe&apos;s mission to Indiamight possibly result in the formation of an Indian Navy.The First Sea Lord assured him that the gift to Australia and canada would not prejudice a possible gift to start an Indian Navy.The War Cabinet approved both of these proposals.
