1. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of a Bill toprovide for the assessment of compensation in respect of land aquired compulsorily for public purposes, and the costs in prn-ceeding in respect of such assessment (Paper G.T.-6910).Mr. Bonar Law stated that he regretted the War Cabinet hadnot before them the points which would be made by possiblepolitical opponents of this Bill. He thought it was desirable thatthe nature of this opposition should be known, so that it would notbe sprung unexpectedly on the Government when they were intro-ducing the Bill in the House.The President of the Board of Agriculture said that he thought the Bill as it originally stood would appeal to the Conservativesmore than the draft now before the Cabinet. He was of opinionthat the reference to the Finance Act of 1910, in the alternativeclauses 1 and 2, might with advantage be deleted.In answer to a question as to the views of the Lord chancellor on this Bill, the Attorney-General said that he thought the LordChancellor was opposed to the whole plan, and was of theopinion that a tribunal should be set up analogous to that of theRailway and Canal Commission, with a judicial Chairman and twoAssessors.It,was pointed out, however, that such a course would involvevery great delays, and that such a tribunal would throw on thecommunitv unnecessary legal charges.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt very strongly on the question of public authorities having to pay far inexcess of the value of land. He felt equally strongly on theGovernment taking land without adequate compensation. Machineryfor arriving quickly at a fair price was what was required, and hethought that a great section of the Unionist Party would take this line.    In order to do this decisive action was necessary.With reference to clause 3, sub-section 4, Mr. Chamberlainsaid that the Local Government Board had stated that they wouldrequire further powers than those given in this Bill for the acquisitionof slum property, and he suggested that the powers required shouldbe inserted in this clause, instead of the Housing Bill. He had also asked the President of the Local Government Board toconsider, when a new district was opened for industrial develop-ment, whether it should not be made a condition that the personbringing in the new industry should provide proper housing accommodation for his employees.The Prime Minister suggested that the whole of clause 8 of theHousing Bill, dealing with provisions as to the acquisition anddisposition of land, should be transferred to the Acquisition of land bill. In this connection the Prime Minister suggested the desirabilityof reconsidering the machinery for acquiring land in the Ways and communications Bill now before the House, where he believed it was proposed to proceed under the Lands Clauses Acts. One obviouseffect of the activities of the new Ministry would be to enhance thevalue of the land served by any light railways put down.The Attorney-General agreed that the Land Clauses Acts hadno defender. Under those Acts the method was for each side toappoint an arbitrator, and they in turn appointed an umpire. Thetwo arbitrators performed no really judicial function. The present bill preserved the merits of the Lands Clauses Acts without theirdemerits.Some discussion then took place on the advisability of retainingin the Bill clause 3, sub-sections 5 and 6, relating to the enhancementin the value of land owing to the action of the State or public authorities. The Attorney-General explained that these sub-clausesdealt only in a tentative and restricted fashion with the question ofbetterment. It was difficult to go further without opening up vastand very controversial issues of social policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be willing
3 WC 539to give power to a local authority to take additional land adjoiningthat required for public purposes, and to give power also to the ownerto make them take it up to a reasonable amount, not, for example,necessarily a whole estate, but a farm. Where claims for worsementwere lodged, a public authority might be given power to purchaseat the valuers valuation so much of the land as the valuer found&quot; worsened,&quot; and the owner should have the right to sell his land tothe public authority if there was a betterment charge.The Prime Minister agreed that when a claim for severance wasmade, a public authority might be given the power to purchase thewhole or part of the property.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The reference to the Finance Act of 1910, in alternativeclauses 1 and 2, should be deleted, and the effectivewords of Section 33 of that Act should he set out inthis Bill;(b.) Section 8 of the Housing Bill (Paper G.T.-6911) should be incorporated in the Acquisition of Land Bill ;(c.) The Attorney-General should consider, in consultation with sir Eric Geddes, the clauses dealing with land in the ways and Communications Bill ;(cZ.) The following Committee should be appointed to consider further the Acquisition of Land Bill, in the light of thediscussion which had taken place, having special regardto the clauses relating to betterment, to severance, and tothe scope of the Bill generally : *The Lord Chancellor (Chairman),The Attorney-General (Vice-Chairman),Sir Eric Geddes,Dr. Addison,The Lord Advocate,Mr. G. H. Roberts,, . Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen,Mr. Leslie Sco.tt,Mr. Pembroke Wicks (Secretary).Land Settlement 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration the  followingand Housing. memoranda : Land Settlement (Facilities) Bill, with covering note by LordErnie (Paper G.T.-6791);Revised Draft Bill (Paper G.T.-6791 a) ;Housing Bill, with covering note by Dr. Addison (Paper G.T.-6911).The President of the Board of Agriculture explained that, inhis opinion, no time could be worse than the present for settling menon the land. Agricultural costs were still very heavy, while pricesof produce were beginning to come down. Tbe discussion at lord cave&apos;s Committee, and the former discussion at the Cabinet (WarCabinet 534, Minute 3), had followed the lines that the measure forland settlement should be an emergency Bill for a period of two years,and that its provisions should be confined to ex-Service men. he believed that the Prime Minister, as well as Mr. Montagu and dr. Addison, felt that it should be applicable to the whole popula-tion ; but the provision of small holdings at present would constitute a heavy burden on the State.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in a discussion which he had had with Lord Ernie he had put this matter to him* This is the form of the Committee as finally amended by War Cabinet 540,Minute 1, and War Cabinet 541, Minute 2..

very strongly. All authorities were agreed that the present was amost unfortunate time for initiating a great land settlement scheme.In the case of ex-soldiers, we were pledged to do this, but if weattempted to extend the scheme to the whole population we shouldbe greatly increasing the burden on the taxpayer. At the sametime it would break down the conditions under which local authorities were now settling people on the land. The measure would beregarded not as emergency legislation referring to one class only,but as permanent legislation affecting the whole population ; and itwould be considered that the State was undertaking permanently thefunctions now performed by local authorities. Even if it was regarded as emergency legislation, the expense must be very serious.In addition to this expense there was the loss which the state would incur on their housing scheme, estimated at anything from20,000,00()Z. to 40,000,OOOZ. a year for many years, and in view ofthese costs he would urge upon the War Cabinet that these develop-ments should be restricted, for the time being, within the limits towhich they were pledged.Mr. Symonds explained that the housing scheme for Englandand Wales would mean an annual charge of 4,000,000Z. or 5,000,000/..on the Exchequer. In reply to Sir Auckland Geddes he explainedthat this did not include the capital loss to the State for depreciationat the end of seven years.Mr. Munro said that he had been informed that the total annualdeficit in Scotland alone would amount to about 5,000,000Z.Lord Ernie said that he felt there would be less oppositionto the scheme in the House of Commons if it were confined to ex-service men.The Prime Minister asked if he thought the House of commons would oppose the settlement on the land of agricultural labourerswho had not fought in the war.Lord Ernie pointed out that he thought there would be greatopposition to this if it entailed putting one-third of the cost on theState.Sir Auckland Geddes said that if we were not prepared to settlemen on the land &quot;they would emigrate. There were a great many men, apart from soldiers, who would wish to participate in thescheme.Mr. Bonar Law thought that they were all agreed that thescheme would have to be undertaken in the case of ex-service men,but the cost to the State would be very great. Unless the price ofagricultural produce was maintained the danger was that the land-settlement scheme would involve a permanent burden on theExchequer.The Prime Minister said that he thought we should regard thismatter from a wider point of view. The policy here advocated wasthe same as that put into effect by Mr. Balfour in Ireland, althoughit was on a larger scale. In Ireland Mr. Balfour had found acondition of social disorder, chronic trouble, poverty, and misery,which he desired to ameliorate, and he had developed a large schemefor settling labourers on the land. It was not an economic scheme.It involved considerable grants from the State, certainly up to thebeginning of the war, if not since. There was no doubt that ireland had benefited thereby. It was true she was not contented, but what would have happened in Ireland during the last five years ifthe same conditions had prevailed as before the Balfour schemes were put into operation ? The same applied with regard to houses.About 50,000 had been built in Ireland, largely at the expense ofthe State. He was told that they had transformed the whole country.In Europe we were now faced with very serious conditions.Russia had gone almost completely over to Bolshevism, and we hadconsoled ourselves with the thought that they were only a half-civilised race ; but now even in Germany, whose people were without
exception the best educated in Europe, prospects are very black.Bavaria was already in chaos, and the same fate might await Prussia.Spain seemed to be on the edge of upheaval. In a short time we might have three-quarters of Europe converted to Bolshevism. Nonewould be left but France and Great Britain. He believed thatGreat Britain would hold out, but only if the people were given a sense of confidence only if they were made to believe that things were being done for them. &quot;We had promised them reforms timeand again, bi.it little had been done. We must give them the con-viction this time that we meant it, and we must give them thatconviction quickly. We could not afford to wait until prices wentdown. If nothing were done, the people themselves would breakdown prices. The same general considerations applied to the questionof housing. We were 300,000 houses below our normal level, andthat level was itself far below what it should be. He had beeninformed that people were saying, &quot; When the Government wanted to build factories to produce shells, they had overcome all difficulties ;they had obtained the land and the factories had been built. Whenit came to the question of providing houses, the Government was still talking, and meanwhile people were without homes.&quot; Thatwas actually the case, and it was necessary for the State to come in and grapple fairly with the problem at issue. We should gain agreat deal more than we should lose. At a Conference of ministers on Tuesday last, it was estimated that, even if we could do all we wished to do during the coming year, it would cost us 71,000,0OOZ.Even if it cost 100,000,000/., what was that compared with the stability of the State? In Germany the Scheidemann Governmenthad been too weak to carry out the promises they had made, andthe result was the conversion of the people to the Spartacist doctrines.We must be prepared to look at all these problems from the point ofview of the stability of the State. There were indications that evenFrance was not very stable, and he could foresee the possibility thatthis country might have to stand alone for social order and commonsense against anarchy, as we bad stood for freedom against despotism.So long as we could persuade the people that we were prepared tohelp them and to meet them in their aspirations, he believed thatthe sane and steadv leaders amongst the workers would have an easyvictory over the Bolsheviks among them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that they all agreed with the general attitude expressed by the Prime Minister.The situation was serious, and must be dealt with boldly, withdetermination, and not by nibbling at it; but the whole of thesituation had not been put forward. We would come to a timefinally wdien we should have to pay, and heavy taxation would affectmarkets and prices. He regarded housing as the first problem to be faced. It was a very big one, but we ought to push on with it immediately, at whatever cost to the State. Granted that thehousing scheme must be undertaken, granted the land settlementscheme must be undertaken in the case of ex-soldiers, was itnecessary to deal in the same way with the rest of the populationwhen it was so excessively expensive to do so ?The Prime Minister enquired what would be the additional costof extending the scheme to include agricultural labourers of 45 or 50years of age.The President of the Board of Agriculture thought that agricultural labourers would prefer an untied cottage with an acre orhalf an acre of land to a small holding. The only expensive item inthis would be the provision of the cottages.The Prime Minister pointed out that that was a housingquestion.Lord Ernie, continuing, said that he did not think agricultural labourers would be very eager to go in for holdings as their solemeans of support. The demand on their part for small holdingswould not be very great; they wished rather for something that
would make them independent of their employers. He did not mean independent as regards wages, for they would always haveto rely upon employers for wages, but independent as regards their homes. This would not be very expensive, and he thought it would satisfy the men.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he regarded the housing scheme as something to which we were pledged, and which ought tobe tackled at once. He would suggest that the Local GovernmentBoard should make housing a county problem instead of a districtproblem.Mr. Symonds said that the point was partly met by Clause 3 ofthe Housing Bill. He had conferred with Sir Daniel Hall, and ithad been agreed that, in the cases to which it was applicable, theCounty Council should undertake housing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that it shoidd be announced that these special provisions were for .the present being-confined to soldiers. Later on it would be possible to deal with the wider problem.Lord Ernie said that, if this were done, they would have theAcquisition of Land Bill to help them in their scheme. In addition,under the Small Holdings Act, 1908, the State had to repay theCounty Council part or whole of the loss incurred in putting theAct into operation. This clause also could be used up to the hiltlater on.The Prime Minister asked, with regard to housing for landsettlement, which Department would provide the houses. TheBoard of Agriculture provided allotments.Mr. Symonds explained that under the provisions of theHousing Bill the County Councils might be the authorities in both cases. They acquired land, and would be at liberty to say whetherthey wished to build on it or to leave the building to the DistrictCouncil. If they wished to build themselves they would be allowedto do so.Mr. Bonar Law enquired what provisions there were for com-pelling the County Councils to carry out the scheme.Lord Ernie pointed out that, under Section 2, Part I, of the revised Bill, the Board of Agriculture took power to carry out thescheme themselves if the County Councils refused to do so, or if theBoard were dissatisfied with what was being done. The Board ofAgriculture had collateral powers with the County Councils.The Prime Minister said that in Belgium thei&apos;e existed a system by which a great part of the population had its houses and gardensoutside the city. He would like the Local Government Board toconsider the applicability of this system to our housing scheme.(At this point the War Cabinet adjourned the discussion to a meeting to be held at 6T5 p.m. the same day.)2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,March 3, 1919.o
