Payment for Goods 1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumsupplied to from the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-6829), in which germany. wag stated that a divergence of aims had appeared among theBritish delegates in Paris in regard to payment for food supplied toGermany.The approval of the War Cabinet was requested for a draft telegram to Mr. Balfour (Appendix), pointing out the divergence of views of Mr. Hughes, as expressed at the Inter-Allied Commissionon Reparation and the views of Mr. Bonar Law, as expressed at theSupreme War Council (Paper I.C.-105, Minute 5), in regard to therelative priority of claims for reparation for acts of damage and claims for indemnity.The Prime Minister said that he was informed that the FrenchGovernment were restricting their claims to claims for war damage,and would not press for indemnity, inasmuch as their bill for directwar damage could be made up to 4,000,000,000Z., or any figure theycared to name, and it would be very difficult to dispute the claim.The Belgians were taking the same line. The British claims for reparation, apart from indemnity, were exceedingly small. If theclaims for reparation were given an absolute priority, they wouldprobably absorb the whole of the amount it was possible to obtain from Germany. Mr. Hughes had unfortunately admitted in theCommission that claims for reparation would come first. Theimportant thing was to secure payment before Germany againbecame powerful. It was the first payments which mattered. Noone would go to war to recover an indemnity, and it was possible,and indeed likely, that if Germany became powerful again, the time would come when, in order to recover an indemnity, our only remedywould be to declare war or to go without. He had sent a note toMr. Hughes, urging that reparation must include indemnity, andhad added that, in his judgment, reparation should not come first ;if it did, Great Britain would recover nothing at all.Mr. Chamberlain said that he had heard that the americans were sending surveyors into the damaged districts in France toappraise the damage for themselves. If the Government stood byMr. Bonar Law&apos;s declaration, the British claims will be paid in full.Reparation might be 10s. or 20s. in the pound, according to thecharacter of the claims, but in any case the British claims for repara-tion for direct damage were very small. Lord Sumner bad written to him that the British claims had been made out on a theoreticalbasis of so much per ton for the hull, and so much per ton for the cargo. Lord Sumner thought that claims of that kind were untenable,and he wanted claims made out for each ship in each case. He had communicated with the Board of Trade, and they were preparing astatement in accordance with Lord Sumner&apos;s view.The Prime Minister pointed out that the British were standingalone in this matter; the Italians had no interest, as there was noAustria left and no chance of getting indemnity ; while the french had based their claims solely on reparation.Mr. Long agreed that, if the French were allowed to have priority for their claims in the way suggested, we should be left in the lurch.He thought that Mr. Hughes had only made the admission he had with a desire to moderate the case which he had put too strongly.Mr. Montagu suggested that it was necessary to provide a formulathat would secure the division of the money equally, according towar effort.Mr. Churchill drew attention to the great importance of theBritish indebtedness to the United States, 8,000,000 . ; the saleof British securities in the United States, 1,200,000,0001. ; and export of bullion to the United States 400,0OO,00OL After the absolute destruction of property in France and Belgium he con-sidered this claim should be the next, involving, as it did, a completealteration of our financial position in relation to America. We hadbeen harder hit than any other country, in that we had paid these
Ministry of ways and Comniuni-cations.Merchant Shipping:Clause 2 (1) (g).enormous sums for other people. He desired to make the Germansresponsible for the discharge of our overseas debt, and he had thought that the United States should be confronted with that pointof view.The War Cabinet decided To confirm the view stated by Mr. Bonar Law at the supreme war Council (Paper I.C.-105),and requested  The Acting Secretary to invite Lord Sumner, Lord Cunliffe, andMr. Hughes to return to London immediately to discussthe matter.*2. The War Cabinet considered the draft Bill for the Ministryof Ways and Communications (Paper G.T.-6S12), together withmemoranda thereon by the President of the Board of Trade, theAir Ministry, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Papers G.T.-6801, 6809, and 6832).Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith stated that the Board of Tradetook exception to clause 2 (l) (g), which provided for the transfer to the new Ministry of the powers and duties of the Board ofTrade in relation to merchant shipping, including pilotage.Sir Eric Geddes said he assumed that the Minister of ways and Communications should lie responsible for the conveyance ofgoods in the kingdom and into the kingdom. He stated that sir Albert Stanley, on the other hand, considered it was wrong toput into one Department competing services of this description.Sir Albert Stanley agreed that, if there was to be a Ministry of ways and Communications, the new Ministry should have controlover merchant snipping, but was of opinion that the new Depart-ment should be a Ministry of Kailwavs and not a Ministry of Wavsand Communications, in which case it would be logical to excludeshipping altogether.Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith said that he thought Sir AlbertStanlev would suggest that the new Ministry should be responsiblefor all forms of transport over which the State for the time beingassumed control. A Department which was administratively andfinancially responsible for one form of transport service would notbe regarded as an impartial regulator of a competing private service.The inclusion of merchant shipping uuder clause 2 (1) (g) was anexcrescence on the Bill : in all other respects the Bill dealt withinland transport. It might be necessary at some time or another togo to Parliament and seek-control over shipping. At present no real powers would be obtained under the Bill in respect of nationalisation of shipping, but suspicion would be aroused and theshipping interest would be alarmed. Tbe shipping interest wasvery powerful, and there was no doubt it would add greatly tothe difficulties of getting the Bill through if this clause were retained.Sir Eric Geddes said there was no provision for taking overanything but the existing powers of the Board of Trade. Theshipping interest had no reason for taking exception to that. he attached great importance to this clause.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that the chances of theBill would be greatly imperilled by the inclusion of the clause.There was no vested interest in the House of Commons so powerfulas the shipping interest. He was informed that the shipping industry had a stupendous task before them in restoring overseastrade, and were very suspicious of any Government action beingproposed in Parliament.    On the other hand, they were in close* At a later stage the Prime Minister decided that he himself would go to Paris,and that therefore Lord Sumner, Lord. cunliffe, and Mr. Hughes need not be invitedto return to London. &apos;fbis decision again was subsequently rescinded, and Mr.Hughes, Lord Sumner, and Lord Cunliffe attended a Meeting of the War Cabinet,held on the 25th February, 1919.
touch with the Board of Trade, and would not welcome association with a new Department of whose intentions they knew nothing.Mr. John Anderson said that Sir Joseph Maclay, who was unableto be present owing to illness, was of opinion that the functions ofthe Government in relation to shipping should remain with Board ofTrade, in which was vested the duty of safe-guarding the trade ofthe country. He would deprecate very strongly any attempt to take these functions from the Board of Trade and give them to a new department mainly concerned with land transport. Any attempt todo so would arouse the very strongest protest and create appre-hension in the minds of the shipping community.Sir Eric Geddes stated that if the Ministry of Shipping were tocontinue as such, he agreed that there was no case to be made out for the proposals contained in the Bill.Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith pointed out that there was aproposal in the Bill to give express power to take over the coastingtrade by agreement. Traders would object to that, as somethingbetween one-third and one-half of the railway rates were more or lessaffected by the coasting trade, and in that way the coasting tradewas a great regulator of rates.The War Cabinet decided that Clause 2 (l) (g) should be excluded.3. Some discussion was raised with regard to the proposed transfer of harbours, docks, and piers, under clause 2(1) (/), and itwas pointed out that difficulty might be experienced in the House ofCommons from the leading dock authorities, especially those of liverpool, London, and Glasgow.Sir Eric Geddes said that if power to control docks were removed from the Bill it would emasculate the Bill. The control of ports influenced the whole system of transport, and lie regarded itas a vital matter to be able to regulate traffic in the ports.The War Cabinet decided that Clause 2 (1) (/) should stand.Supply of 4. Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith drew attention to the viewsElectricity: expressed by the President of the Board of Trade in his memorandumClause 2 (1) (A). (Paper G.T.-6801), and remarked that the supply of electrical power was overwhelmingly an industrial problem, that the netelectrical demand for railways would probably not be more than10 per cent, of the industrial demand.Sir Eric Geddes observed that, with the best estimate it waspossible to make of the development of power for heavy traction, theamount of power required for traction would certainly be more than20 per cent, for railways alone. Lighting was only 4 per cent., anda large portion of the remainder consisted of tramway traction.Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith said the Board of Trade were ofopinion that the provision of electrical power should be in the handsof electricity commissioners responsible to a Department that was con-cernecl with the general interests of electrical users as a wdiole, ratherthan in the hands of a large consumer, such as the Minister-of ways and Communications. Consumers would never believe that thepowers of the Ministry were exercised impartially. The Bill took no powers in regard to electricity, it only transferred wdratever powersexisted in regard to electricity, and a new Bill would be requiredto enable it to supply electricity. The Board of Trade had a newBill in draft, which ought to be pressed forward in the House ofCommons at the earliest possible moment. There was nothing in- the new Bill to prevent the new railway authority developing itsown electric power supply in the most economical way. If theBoard of Trade Bill were held over till the new Ministry of WaysHarbours, Docks,and Piers :Clause 2 (1) (/).
and Communications was established, the Session would probably be lost and the Bill would have to be postponed until next year, whichwould be disastrous. The Board of Trade were also afraid that the municipal institutions were strong enough to wreck any proposal toput electricity under the Department which represented the railways.The municipal authorities were already moving in the matter. If a transfer were desired in the future it could easily be done by a short bill. The Archibald Williamson Committee, representing all theinterests, had come to an agreement which, with very slightmodifications, was embodied in the Board of Irade Bill. If the municipal, authorities took alarm, the agreement so arrived at. wouldbe thereby dissolved, and the position would revert to the state, ofchaos and confusion which had hitherto existed.The Secretary of State for War remarked that the Ministry ofMunitions in three years bad multiplied enormously the electrical power supply of the country as compared with thirty years underthe Board of Trade. No doubt they had wider and altogetherdifferent powers, but on the merits he would have thought that itwould be better to place electricity under the- new authority proposedby the Bill. He suggested that the Board of Trade should proceedwith the Electrical Supply Bill, which should be followed up by the ways and Communications Bill.The &quot;Prime Minister concurred that the Board of Trade should proceed with their Electricity Supply Bill, and suggested that sir eric Geddes should come to an arrangement with the Board of Tradeto transfer their electrical powers to the new Ministry by Order inCouncil.Sir Eric Geddes said that the Board of Trade Bill stopped shortat compulsory transmission, which, in his view, was quite inadequate.They could only generate, and had no compulsory power to transmit.They could take over transmission lines by agreement only. But, inorder to deal successfully with electricity at high tension, you must take it up to the point where you reduce the pressure and give it tothe distribution mains. Sir Albert Stanley took the view thatantagonism existed between the railways and the trading community :the contrary was the case the railway was the life-blood of industry,and it was along the railway track that the pioneer transmissioncables ought to go. To get the most economical working power of electrical plant on a railway, electricity must be distributed to all industries in the surrounding district, so as to get a steady load.The idea that the railway interest in electricity would squeeze out-industry was not tenable for a moment, lie warned to push the electrical power supply tor all it was worth, both in the interests of railways and industry.The President of the Local Government Board suggested thatthe provision of power was the function of the Ministry of Supply.It was for Sir Eric Geddes to provide the power stations, and heshould make arrangements with the Ministry of Supply to supplyelectricity in the same way that it would supply other commodities.The proper organisation, so far as the State was concerned, was theMinistry of Supply, upon whom Sir Eric Geddes would indent in thesame way as other Departments indent for their requirements. Hewas not in favour of the Board of Trade proposal.Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith said that if the two Bills were toproceed: side by side the Board of Trade might be put in a difficult position in piloting their Bill. He would, however, at once consultSir Albert Stanley on the subject.The War Cabinet decided that The Board of Trade should proceed with their Electricity SupplyBill, and that the Bill creating the Ministry of Ways and communications should include power to transfer to it all or any powers of any Government Department relating tosupply of electricity, but in order to avoid the delay that[826]-193 C
would otherwise result the Cabinet wish the Board o,Trade to proceed at once with the Supply of Electricity Billafter meeting any criticisms that Sir Eric Geddes may wishto make on the Bill as drafted. The above decision to besubject to the concurrence of the President of the Board ofTrade (who was unable to attend the Meeting).*Conveyance by air: 5. The War Cabinet decided-Sir Eric Geddes concurring Clause 2 (1) (*).        that-The power to convey passengers and goods by air should be deleted from the Bill.Power to takePossession ofEailways.Power to acquireEailways.Bail wayNationalisation.Clause 4.6. The Secretary of State for India asked whether clause 3 (b)meant that the Government were going to nationalise the railways.Sir Eric Geddes said that the power to take possession of rail-ways under this clause was taken for two years only. Under theDefence of the Realm Act the Board of Trade had power to takepossession of the railways. This merely enabled the new Ministerto continue the powers for two years&apos;- which had been exercisedduring the war. Otherwise so soon as the Defence of the RealmAct lapsed there would be no power at all to control railways.There were two main facts to be considered--The Runciman letter, which was a binding letter, gave therailways two years more, during which the Governmentguaranteed the same profits as the railways had earned in the pre-war period.A Select Committee of the House of Commons, which hadbeen appointed to examine the question of the nationalisa-tion of railways, had not yet reported.(a.)(6.)Clause 3 was agreed to.7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that if it were decided to retain the substance of the clause it would be necessaryfor him to confer with Sir Eric Geddes in regard to the method of payment. He desired to raise the big question whether it was rightto attempt to deal in this Bill with the purchase of railways by theState. The War Cabinet at the moment had no policy in thematter ; some kind of control must continue, and it was possible thatnationalisation was the right; policy ; but the Select Committee hadnot yet reported and the Government bad never considered it. Hethought it a mistake to insert these powers before the Governmenthad made up their mind. The proper course, if nationalisation were decided on, was to introduce a special Bill in Parliament for thatexpress purpose.Sir Eric Geddes regarded the powers as important in order toput him in a position to negotiate with the railway companiesduring the next two years. They were not at present in a veryconciliatorv mood.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether it would not do.simply to have power to purchase without specifying how thepurchase should be arranged.The Prime Minister said he thought it would be desirable, tohave powers which would enable the Government to enter into negotiations when they had considered the matter. There were already powers to purchase under an Act passed in 1844, and whenhe was President of the Board of Trade the railway managers hadbeen not unwilling to hand over the railways to a body like thePort of London Authority, but it was found to be undesirable under that Act. The railways were now working at a deficiency of9O,000,O00L, and the railway companies would not take them overin two years&apos; time unless the Government were prepared to make upthat deficiency, or else allow them to raise their charges.   The* Sir Albert Stanley later wrote to the Prime Minister signifying his concurrence.
Power to acquireTramways.Clause 4 (1) (a).8. Attention was called to the power to acquire tramways,which it was suggested would raise very strong opposition amongmunicipal authorities.Sir Eric Geddes remarked that inter-urban and suburbancommunication were so linked up that it would be very difficult to solve the traffic problem without, acquiring the right to purchasetramways. The regulation of inter-urban tramways was an integral part of the solution of tbe housing problem.The Secretary for Scotland said that Glasgow, for example,would raise the strongest possible objection.The Prime Minister pointed out that the London CountyCouncil and the municipal authorities of Birmingham, Manchester,and other great towns would also object.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that powers ofcontrol and compulsion where two authorities were not agreed wouldprovide all that was necessary in the meantime.The Prime Minister said, in reply to Sir Eric Geddes, who asked if he must drop construction as well as the purchase of tramways,that that was a different matter and not open to the same objection.The War Cabinet decided To delete tramways from clause 4 (l) (a).trading community might be prepared to submit to increased charges in the form of general taxation, but they would not agree to it ifit were for the purpose of increasing the dividends of railway share-holders, and there would be a combined trade and labour oppositionto any proposal to increase the rates. He was also of opinionthat if the Government could say that they had in mind a proposalto make the railways State property it would be much easier to dealwith the. menacing industrial trouble. They would be in a positionto say to the men that they were imposing a burden on the com-munity if they persisted in their demands, which would have to bemet either by increased taxation or an increase in the price of com-modities. The powers must be exercised by Order in Council whichwould lie on the table of the House, and could not be made effective without the sanction of the House of Commons. On the other band,to introduce a Bill might enable a determined minority to hold up thematter for months.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that there was nothing so unpopular in the House of Commons as legislation byOrder in Council, and in his view it would be absolutely necessaryfor the Prime Minister himself to make a strong&quot; personal appeal tothe House.The Secretary&quot; of State for India asked whether it wasimpossible to decide the question of nationalisation immediately.The Prime Minister asked the Secretary of State for India notto press the point and said that he would like Sir Eric Geddes tobe in office first, in order to be able to advise the Government in thelight of his experience in office whether it were desirable or not.He believed owing to the fierce competition among railways themajority of railway managers held nationalisation to be inevitable.The Secretary of State for War remarked that the railwayshareholders deserved consideration, in view of the damage to therailways during the war.Sir Eric Geddes did not agi-ee that the Government had ruinedrailway property. He held that wages and general costs wouldhave risen anyhow.The President of the Boat d of Agriculture pointed out that aCommission on Nationalisation was sitting before the war and hadbeen suspended eighteen months after the war broke out. Thegeneral idea of the Commission had been that nationalisation shouldnot be attempted until some idea had been gained as to how itwould work.
Power to acquireby AgreementShipping Linesrunning in competition withthe Railway.Clause 4 (1) (a).9. Sir Eric Geddes said that he asked for this power in order tobe able to buy a competitive shipping line where the shippingcompany complained of railway competition.The Prime Minister suggested that this clause should not beput in the Bill, but should be offered as a concession if necessary.Determination of purchase Price :Clause 4 (2)and (3).10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was uncertainabout the provision in clause 4 (2) and (3) for the determination of aprice to be paid for an undertaking in default of agreement by aCourt of Arbitration, lie would like to leave it open for discussionwith Sir Eric Geddes, with power to come to the Cabinet again ifnecessary. If the Government contemplated the purchase of rail-ways they ought to be run to pay their way as a commercial concernon a proper basis, and accounts ought to be kept so that everythingfor which they were responsible should be charged against them that was to say, special railway stock ought to be issued against therailway revenue with the guarantee of the Consolidation Fundbehind it.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the Bill, subject to the conclusions aboverecorded and to verbal drafting amendments.(6.) To appoint a drafting committee to consider the clauses ofthe Bill, consisting of Sir Eric Geddes,The President of the Board of Trade,The Home Secretary,together with representatives of -The Local Government Board,The Scottish Office,The Irish Office.Control of Building 11. The Wax Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byfor Land Lord Ernie (Paper G.T.-6797) regarding the control of building for settlement. lanci settlement.The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat, in accordance with a decision of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet496, Minute 12), the First Commissioner of Works claimed that thefunctions of his Department covered the whole of the building work,advisory and actual, that might be entaded in the scheme of buildingsfor small holdings for the County Councils. Lord Ernie said that, inhis view, this work, together with that of adaptation and housing onthe small-holdings colonies, should be carried out by the Board ofAgriculture. He had already appointed an architectural staff, whowere about to issue a series of type plans to the County Councils asa basis for the work of their architects.The First Commissioner of Works stated that the War cabinet had laid down (War Cabinet 496, Minute 12) that the only Govern-ment Departments which should be empowered to undertake building or constructional work should be the Admiralty, the War Office, theMinistry of Munitions, and the Air Ministry, and that the duty ofcarrvine&apos; out work for other Government works should be entrusted to the Office of Works. His Department had an efficient districtorganisation and maintenance contractors all over the country, who could carry out the work of the Board of Agriculture.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the HaldaneCommittee recommended that services should be grouped under one
Peace Celebrations. i2- The War Cabinet had before them correspondence betweenthe Commonwealth of Australia and the Colonial Office, in whichthe High Commissioner asked that lie might be supplied with full particulars regarding any arrangements which were being made inthis country in connection with the celebration of peace. (paper g.T.-6784.)The War Cabinet decided To appoint the following Committee to examine the question ofpeace celebrations in this country, and to make recom-mendations to the War Cabinet: Lord Curzon (Chairman),The Home Secretary,The First Commissioner of Works,A representative of the Admiralty,A representative of the War Office,A representative of the Colonial Office.Soldiers&apos;and 13. With reference to War Cabinet 533, Minute 4, the WarSailors&apos; Pay Cabinet took note of the following decision arrived at by the Soldiers&apos;Committee. -  and gajiors&apos; pay Committee :- *&quot;That pensioners in the non-commissioned ranks should receivethe full monthly increment, but that, in so far as the corn-missioned ranks are concerned, it is not desirable to makeany change as the result of this decision.826-193]Dparticular Minister, and if different services were allowed to growup under the various Departments it would mean a great multipli-cation of staff. Under the new Housing Bill the President of theLocal Government Board reserved to himself the right to buildhouses if the local authorities proved- themselves incapable. This &quot;might mean that the Local Government Board would ask theTreasury to sanction a staff of architects ; the Board, of Agriculture,if Lord Ernle&apos;s present proposal was adopted, would want anotherstaff of architects, when all the time the First Commissioner ofWorks had a trained staff ready to carry out the work. TheChancellor of the Exchequer strongly urged that the Board ofAgriculture should specify their needs and allow the Office of works to carry them out.The President of the Local Government Board said that it was true he had asked for powers under the new Housing Bill to building default of action by the local authorities, but his intention wasthat the work should be carried out by the Office of Works.The President of the Board of Agriculture asked that he shouldbe allowed in any case to complete the half-built cottages on which work had been stopped vdien the War Cabinet instructed that nobuilding should be done except that directly required for war purposes.The War Cabinet decided that The adaptation and housing requirements of the Board ofAgriculture should be carried out by His majesty&apos;s Officeof Works, but that the Board of Agriculture should completeany building operations initiated by them which had been interrupted owing to war conditions.

With reference to the Joint Conference of GovernmentDepartments and Trade Unions concerned, before which the InterimReport No. 1 on the Application of the Whitley Report to Govern-ment Industrial Establishments is to be brought on the 20thFebruary at the Central Plall, Westminster The War Cabinet took note that the Prime Minister had ap-pointed Sir Robert Home, Minister of Labour, to be Chair-man of the Inter-Departmental Committee to consider theApplication of the Whitley Report to Government Estab-lishments vice Mr. Roberts (War Cabinet 438, Minute 12).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,February 20, 1919.14.
