1. With reference to War Cabinet 519, Minute 5, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Home Secretary(Paper G.T.-6970) relating to a demand for the recognition of theMetropolitan Police Union.The Home Secretary said that circumstances might arise in thenear future when, in his opinion, it would be necessary for the Govern-ment to make an announcement that the Police Union would not berecognised, and he desired now the authority of the War cabinet for making such an announcement when the necessity arose. Mr.Shortt then explained the present condition of affairs within theForce. He said that the Executive Committee of the RepresentativeBoard, which had been set up after the strike in August last, hadbeen captured by the officials of the union. The Executive Com-mittee had sent to the Commissioner of Police an insulting resolutionwith regard to matters connected with the Force, and the Commis-sioner had refused to meet any member of the Executive who hadbeen responsible for the drafting of that resolution. The executive had then endeavoured to approach himself, but he had refused tomeet them: The next step of the Executive was to say that theCommissioner had refused to meet any member of the ExecutiveCommittee. He (the Home Secretary) then received a deputation,and it was quite clear that the accusation that the Commissioner wouldnot consent to meet any member of the Executive was withoutfoundation.All these manoeuvres by the Executive were brought about inorder to secure recognition of the union, and to give it the powersof an ordinary industrial union. The Commissioner^ proposal nowwas to set up a new form of Representative Board. The old board had consisted jointly of inspectors, sergeants, and constables, but itwas found that a Board so constituted had a bad effect on the discipline of the men. The new proposal Avas that there should be three Boards, consisting of (a) inspectors, (b) Serjeants, and(c) constables. The inspectors had accepted the invitation, but theSerjeants and constables threatened to boycott the other two Boards.Sir Nevil Macready proposed to deal with this situation by sayingto the men that he was sorry they had refused to accept the new scheme, but that, if the Serjeants and the&apos; constables at any timechanged their mind, they could have their Board. The HomeSecretary added that the real fight was for recognition of the union.It was difficult to say what the feeling of the Force was, but therewas a considerable proportion against the attitude the Executive hadtaken up. The Prime Minister had said that the union could not berecognised at present, and this had the effect of not entirely closingthe discussion. The&apos; Commissioner and himself, however, were convinced that recognition of a union would be fatal to any police force, and he now asked the authority of the War Cabinet to informthe police that their union could not be recognised.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked how far the new proposals afforded the police a channel of communication with theCommissioner. In the navy, they had had a somewhat similardifficulty ; there was a movement on the lower deck, which askedfor a channel of communication through which their wants could berepresented to the Board of Admiralty. Mr. Brace had made astrong appeal in the House on this subject on the previous day. Hebad,dwelt with great insistence on the point&quot; that, in these days,when collective representation was allowed to industries, it was difficult to refuse the soldier, the sailor and the policeman the rightto put forward his views in a collective form. On the other hand,the First Lord had seen the General Secretary of the Federation of trades Unions, who had said that the fact should not be ignored that among the serving Forces there was a strong desire for collectiverepresentation.  He had said that the Trades Unions were opposed to
a union in military bodies, for the reason that, as soon as soldiers orsailors left the Force and took up industrial life, they would desireto introduce the methods of their military Trades Unions into theindustrial Trades Unions. With regard to the Admiralty difficulty,the Board had established a committee of officers, to which wouldbe attached elected representatives of the men at the three homeports, and this committee had the right of making recommendations on such subjects as promotion, pay, &amp;c, direct to the AdmiraltyBoard.    On the whole, this scheme had been well received.The Commissioner of Police said that he was certain that theMetropolitan Police could not be run without a representative boardof some sort. The present Board had been very useful to him, and hehad dealt with a hundred resolutions from it, and discovered anumber of useful things of which, without a board, he would havebeen ignorant. One of the reasons which induced the men tosupport Mr. Marston in his desire for union recognition was the fear that one day there might be a Commissioner who would refuse tohave anything to do with the Board. Then, if there were no union, themen would be in the same position as in August last. His (Sir NevilMacready&apos;s) proposition was that the Representative Boards should bemade statutory for Police Forces above a certain size ; that thePolice authorities should have power to dissolve the board if animpasse were reached on any question, but that a new board mustbe elected.In reply to a question as to what the effect would be if the samerepresentatives were returned at an election, the Home secretary said that that would be an exceptional case, and the men wouldprobably have to be dismissed the Force.The Commissioner of Police then explained the facts which ledup to the insulting resolution he had received from the ExecutiveCommittee, on which he had refused to receive any member whohad had a hand in drafting the resolution.The Secretary for Scotland said that he hoped the War cabinet would accede to the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal. In Scotland themen were neither allowed nor prevented from joining the union, butsooner or later the question of recognition was bound to come up.At Oban the other day, the Chief Constable had had before him fourmen who had joined the union, and gave them the choice of resigningtheir membership of the union or leaving the Force. They weregiven five minutes to decide. Two of the men had refused to give up their membership of the union, and had left the Force ; the other two had remained in the Force and had resigned their membership of the union. The men who left the Force had over twenty years&apos;service in it. This incident had created a great sensation in policecircles, and was bound to raise the question as to whether it waslegal to join the union or not.The Home Secretary, referring to the proposal to constitutethree Representative Boards, one for inspectors, one for sergeants, andone for constables, said that the principle of this question was oneof discipline, and had been threshed out in the negotiations withthe Railway Clerks&apos; Union, where it had been decided to have special branches for the higher grades. In this case each sectionwould elect their own representatives, who would have power toraise any subject and have direct access to the Commissioner, and through the Commissioner, to the Home Secretary. If questionsarose which affected inspectors, sergeants and constables, delegates from the three boards could meet together.The Postmaster-General said that he had found in the PostOffice that it was advantageous to keep the men in as many separatesections as possible.The Commissioner of Police said that, after six months&apos;experience of the Metropolitan Police, he had come to the conclusionthat it would be impossible to administer the Force if the men were allowed to belong to the union, and the day would come when the[826]-338 B 2
men would have to choose between continuing as government servants, with Representative Boards, or becoming unionists.The War Cabinet decided that-Recognition should not be given to the Police Union.Proposed Closing of 9. The War Cabinet had under consideration two Memoranda,&quot;JG ieBS ,uieau- circulated by the Home Secretary, in regard to the proposed closing of the Press Bureau (Papers G.T.-674-2 and 6960), the second ofwhich covered (a) a letter from the Directors of the Press Bureau,urging that the Bureau should be closed down as soon as possible,or that, in any case, the joint Directors should be permitted to resign, as, in their view, the Bureau was no longer required; and(b) a letter from the Secretary of State for India to the HomeSecretary, pointing out that the Bureau, in Mr. Montagu&apos;s opinion,presented by far the most convenient and effective method of com-inunicating official announcements to the press, and suggesting, forconsideration, the advisability of maintaining some small office, onthe lines of the present Bureau, to act as a channel between Govern-ment Departments and the newspapers, for purposes of publicity.The Home Secretary said that the Directors of the Bureau gavestrong reasons for reconsideration of the War Cabinet&apos;s decision inregard to the closing of the Bureau (War Cabinet 531, Minute 7).They contended that there was now practically no work for the bureau to do ; that the small amount of work the Bureau did, cost the country a price out of all proportion to its value ; and that thesaid work could now be eqixally well done by the press itself, or bythe Departments concerned.The view was expressed that if the letter of the Directors to theHome Secretary were made public, it would be difficult to defend the retention of the Bureau, which would be regarded as involving a waste of public money.Colonel Lord William Percy said that, so far as the War office was concerned, there were three reasons wdry, in the view of that department, the abolition of the Press Bureau was at presentundesirable: (a) All cables were divided into press messages and non-press messages. If the Bureau were abolished, the pressmessages would soon become commercial messages, disguised aspress messages to avoid censorship. (0) When the matter had last&apos; been discussed by the War Cabinet, it had been decided to re-establish control over wireless press messages. In point of fact, thecontrol over such messages was not and never had been exercised by the War Office. During the war it was exercised by theAdmiralty, but the &apos; Admiralty abolished their censorship somemonths ago. If the Government now decided to dispense with the bureau, the control over wireless press messages would have to be dropped. (c) It is now done by the Press Bureau, and if the bureau were abolished it would be impossible to prevent certainhighly undesirable messages finding their way into newspapers. Inthis connection he would specially refer to a message from an american newspaper correspondent, which had been received onthe 10th March, 1919, via Paris, violently criticising the BritishExpedition to North Russia.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, so far as his Depart-ment was concerned, there was no objection to closing down the bureau.Lord Curzon, referring to the recommendation put forward byMr. Montagu in his letter, that some office might be maintained as a medium of publicity for Government purposes, expressed the hopethat an early opportunity would be given by the War Cabinet for a discussion on the Report of the Committee on the Secret Service,over which he had presided (War Cabinet 519, Minute 4), whichhad just completed its enquiry. The report made certain suggestions in regard to the setting up of such machinery as Mr. Montaguapparently had in mind.     -
The Postmaster-General said that, in this connection, he wishedto invite the attention of the War Cabinet to a matter of veryconsiderable importance, and that was the reintroduction of com-mercial private codes over the cables. The cables at present wereimmensely congested, and tbe removal of the embargo on privatecodes would release the lines by at least 20 per cent., and wouldmake a great difference to the conduct of business, especially so faras Lancashire Avas concerned. Business men all over the country had pressed strongly for the reintroduction of these codes, but hehad been reluctant to give the necessary permission owing to theobjections raised by the military and naval censors.After some further discussion, the War Cabinet decided that A Committee, composed as under, should assemble at an earlydate to decide the question of the closing of the PressBureau :  The Home Secretary (Chairman),The Postmaster-General,Representatives of The Admiralty,The War Office, andThe Press Bureau.Increased Supply 3. With reference to War Cabinet 5^5, Minute 8, the war of Bear. Cabinet had before them certain recommendations of -the HomeAffairs Committee (Paper H.A.C. 22, Minute 2), (a.) in regard tothe proposed increased supply of beer, and (b.) the appointment of aCommittee to consider the position of the Central Control Board(Liquor Traffic) and the question of future relaxations.Mr. Bonar Law stated that the Home Affairs Committee had recently considered two proposals : (i.) to raise the quantity, and(ii.) to increase the gravity of beer. The Pood ControllersDepartment regarded the question mainly from the point of view oflabour unrest, and recommended that tbe barrelage should beincreased by 50 per cent, and the gravity to 10400. TheCommittee, however, had considered these increases excessive, andhad recommended that there should be an advance of 25 per cent,only on the 1918 statutory barrelage of beer, and that the gravityshould not be raised at present beyond 10360.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that every labour minister bad laid stress on the fact that a great deal of the present industrial unrest was rnainly due to the poor quality of beer. only recently tbe Secretary for Scotland had expressed the same view tohim. The working man regarded the indifferent quality of beer as atypical case of class legislation, and complained that, whereas thelabouring classes could only get a very poor quality of beer, theupper classes could still get wines of pre-war strength. He also suggested that the time had come to change the composition of the liquor Control Board, which he considered was no longerrepresentative.The Minister of Education, speaking as Chairman of the HomeAffairs Committee, said that successful endeavours had been madeto place a really good light beef on the market. It was most desir-able that the taste for a light beer, of good quality, such as wasobtainable on the Continent, should become naturalised in GreatBritain. He deprecated any considerable increases in either amountor gravity, as there was no doubt that the restrictions in force duringthe war had conduced to a great increase in sobriety. As regardsthe recommendation that a Committee should be appointed to ,con-sider the policy to be pursued with reference to the gradual removalof restrictions in drink and the future position of the Central Control
Board, he hoped that the Cabinet would accept this proposal, as heand his colleagues were convinced that the time had come when theGovernment should review the whole situation.Lord Curzon said that he agreed with the Home Affairs Com-mittee that 25 per cent, was a sufficient advance for the present, but thought that it might be gradually increased.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To sanction the following recommendations of the HomeAffairs Committee : (i.) An increase of 25 per cent, on the 1918 statutorybarrelage of beer;(ii.) To raise the.gravity from. 10320 to 10360;(iii.) That no announcement should be made until theChancellor of the Exchequer had considered the bearing of (i) and (ii) on taxation and prices,and that the publication of these relaxationsshould be accompanied by an announcement that they would be taken into account in theBudget.(b.) To appoint a Committee on Liquor Restrictions composed as under, with the following terms of reference: &quot;to formulate a policy of relaxation and to consider thefuture control of the drink traffic &apos;.&apos; : The Minister of Education (in the Chair).Selected members of the Home Affairs Committee.The Minister of Food.Representatives of the Liquor Control Board.Return of theG-uards.Expenditure onDecorations.4. Air. Bonar Law said that he had received a letter from theFirst Commissioner of Works, stating that he had been asked toprovide bunting and decorations for the return of the Guards on the22nd March. He estimated that a very good show could be madefor an expenditure of about 3,&apos;OOOL lie had consulted the treasury and had been told that nothing could be done without a War cabinet decision.   He asked, therefore, to be given the necessary authority.The Secretary of State for War strongly urged that sanctionshould be given to the proposed expenditure on the occasion of thereturn of the Guards, in view of their splendid record and theopportunity the occasion offered of striking a patriotic note. he deprecated the subject being treated in a niggardly spirit. our people had fought and worked, splendidly, and they had sufferedgrievous losses; and the chance of welcoming, in a becomingmanner, their men back from France, could not fail to stimulatetheir patriotism and to have a wholesome effect upon their spirits at. a time when there was so much to depress them.The First Commissioner of Works, in reply to a question, said he believed the expenditure on the celebrations in connection with president Wilson&apos;s visit to London had amounted to nearly 10,0001.The War Cabinet decided -To sanction for the purpose the amount estimated by the first commissioner of Works.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,March 13, 1919.o
