2Industrial Unrest.Strike Situationin Glasgow andBelfast.1. With reference to War Cabinet 522, Minute 1, the chief secretary for Ireland said that as regards the situation in Belfast hehad received a telegram from Lord French saying that the situation was satisfactory as far as it could be. The workmen had formed a&quot;Soviet&quot; Committee, and this committee had received forty-sevenapplications from small traders for permission to use light. Therewere, however, signs which indicated that the strike would not beof long duration.With regard to the situation in Glasgow the Minister of Laboursaid that his latest information was to the effect that a crowd had met in front of the Municipal Buildings in order to receive theGovernments reply to the Lord Provost&apos;s telegram. He had no details, but understood that foot and mounted police had chargedthe crowd in order to quell a riot and casualties had resulted.The Secretary for Scotland said that, in his opinion, it was more clear than ever that it was a misnomer to call the situation in glasgow a strike it was a Bolshevist rising. It was, he thought,of limited dimensions in numbers if not in effect. He would put the malcontents at 10,000, and this was an outside figure. Therewas no doubt that public opinion would support the Governmentin quelling any disorder. Further, there was a feeling of resent-ment on the part of many who wished to return to work that theywere prevented from doing so. The crisis would probably be reachedto-day. The Secretary for Scotland added that he had received information from the office of the Commissioner of the Police to theeffect that the strike gave the appearance of breaking up at anearly date, and that there was a strong feeling against the leaders.General Bonier stated that the necessary orders had beengiven to the G.O.C., Scotland, with regard to the movement oftroops. An officer had been sent to the headquarters of theScottish Command last night to explain the situation. The numberof troops which could be put into Glasgow at short notice was about12,000.The  Deputy  Chief of  the  Imperial General Staff said thatlorries wittdrivers were gom;.north&apos;76 tanks and 100 motorrail that night.The Lord Advocate, with regard to the possibility of arrestingand making examples of some of the leaders in the strike, saidthat there were three possible lines of&quot; action-first, Defence of the realm Regulation No. 14, under which the lenders could be deportedif the Army Council gave the necessary instructions to a competentmilitary authority.Mr. Churchill said that the authority could be given in a very-few minutes, if necessary.The Lord Advocate, proceeding, said the second course was toproceed under Defence of the Realm Regulation No. 42, andarrest a person with a view to prosecution for causing disaffectionamong the civil population. This might be used in the present case if sufficient evidence was available. The third course was toproceed under Defence of the Realm Regulation No. 55, by which any police constable was empowered to make an arrest if he had the suspicion that a past act had been committed or a future act was contemplated against the law. There were, however, difficultiesin the way of this course, inasmuch as mistakes might be made which would place both himself and the Government in an uncom-comfortable position. In his view deportation was practically theonly means of procedure if instant action were required.The First Lord said that he had received satisfactory news from scotland through the Naval Intelligence Department. This was tothe effect that, even if the men were prepared to stand out, thewomen would not let them. Many men wanted to return to work,but were prevented from doing so owing to the stoppage of electric power.    The Naval Intelligence Department also understood that
2. The Secretary of State for War stated that the trouble atCalais had been mastered. Two divisions had been moved to thearea, and order had been restored. The three ringleaders would be tried by court-martial to-morrow. The trouble had arisen over the railwaymen and the Ordnance Corps refusing to work. These men had also managed to involve the troops, who were on board shipwaiting to proceed to England. He added that it would greatlyease disaffection of this sort in France if we could obtain the use ofthe Rhine and the Scheldt Tor the transport of armed troops toCologne. Negotiations to this end were already taking placethrough the usual diplomatic channels. Me feared it would take some time before the necessary permission could be obtained. In themeantime, however, the War Office was making the necessary pre-reparations, and the Acting Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the 23rdJanuary had approved of this course. It was important to bring allpossible diplomatic pressure on the Hutch Government with a viewto securing the facilities asked for.The War Cabinet decided That the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to Paris informing Mr. Balfour of the preparationswhich the Secretary of State for War was making, and adding that unless Mr. Balfour advised to the contrary, itwas proposed to inform the Dutch Government that wewould make use of the Scheldt and Rhine.3. The Minister of Labour said that Sir Albert Stanley and himself had met the representatives of the coal-miners that morningwith regard to their demand for a six hours&apos; day. The deputationalso demanded exceptionally favourable demobilisation terms, viz., thatminers returning from the forces should receive full wages until theyobtained employment, and also that the men turned out of the minesto make way for the returning miners from the forces should receivesimilar treatment until they found work. In addition they askedfor an advance of 30 per cent, on their wages and the nationalisation of the mines. The delegates had said that unless a reply on thewages issue was received by Monday trouble would ensue. It waspointed out to them, however, that the whole wage question wasclosely connected with that of a six-hour day, and the position wouldbe considered by the Government as rapidly as possible, and a reply would be given if possible by the end of next week.Eailway Situation. 4. Sir Albert Stanley entered at this stage and  stated that within the last few minutes the London railwaymen had threatened to go on strike on the following day. The question in dispute was whether the eight-hour day should be inclusive or exclusive of meal-time. The general settlement arrived at a few weeks ago providedfor the acceptance of the principle of an eight-hour working-day(to come into operation on the 1st February), and it was also agreedthat the rnehs conditions of service should remain unchangedpending negotiations.Unrest of troops at Calais.Demands of theCoal Miners.the agitation was badly organised, and there was widespreadill-feeling against the strikers&apos; leaders.    - .The War Cabinet decided That for the moment no further action was necessary by theGovernment.
He then explained the varying conditions as to meal-times onthe different railways. The men on the engines worked whatthey called &quot; an all-over time &quot; of ten, eleven, or twelve hours,which meant the wTork was continuous and the taken on the engines whenever opportunity offered. This applied also tocertain signalmen and shunters. It had been agreed that under the eight-hour day the same practice with regard to meals would becontinued. Other grades on the railway, however, had a definitetime &quot; booked^ off&quot; for meals. The men now said that unless their demands for inclusion of meal-time in the eight hours were concededthey wrould only work eight hours (meal-time inclusive) and thencease work. He had told the Railway Executive to dismiss any menwho carried out this threat. Messrs. Bromley and Hudson, therepresentatives of the men&apos;s Unions, had agreed that the Govern-menfs interpretation of the eight-hour-day was in conformity withthe agreement, i.e., that it should be eight hours&apos; work, exclusive ofmeals. The raiiwaymeii were however, iu some measure out of hand,and although they had been instructed by their leaders to observethis interpretation of the agreement it could not be guaranteed, thatthey would do so. On the whole it was hoped that, except inLondon, to which he would presently refer, no serious difficulty wouldbe experienced in the case of the larger railway companies.Underground. 5. Sir Albert Stanley stated that the. drivers on. the Londonai waym n.. Tubes had previously had somewhat better conditions of service thanthe others. They bad had a nine-hours&apos; day and were allowed totake thirty to fifty minutes off for meals, and these meals were not taken on the train. These men now asked that with the eight-hours&apos; day the same conditions should apply. In Sir Albert Stanley&apos;opinion this demand struck at the very principle of the eight-hours&apos;working day, and if their point was conceded it would become a source of further general concessions. The men threatened to stopall the underpTound trains that night.The Secretary of State for War said that nothing would putpublic opinion more against the strikers than a two or three days&apos;stoppage on the tubes. In his opinion this was a most unjustifiabledemand.The First Lord said that a number of engine-drivers on themain lines would prefer to work ten&apos;or twelve hours consecutively,as this enabled them to make a double journey and thus they were able to sleep at their own homes ; whereas if they left their enginesafter eight hours, it generally necessitated their finding a lodging insome town away from home. On the other hand, the engine-driverson the tube railways were able to sleep at home every night.Some discussion ensued as to whether, by insisting that themeal-times of these men should not be included in the eight-hours&apos;day, the Government were not, in fact, breaking their promise thatthe conditions of service should continue unchanged.In reply to a question as to whether the Union leaders weresupporting the Government in their interpretation of the agreement in this particular instance, Sir Albert Stanley said he could not besure.Eecognition of the 6. Sir Albert Stanley said there was another matter with regardKailway Clerks&apos; to the railway situation, to which he desired to draw the WarAssociation- Cabinets attention.    There was a dispute with the Railway Clerks&apos;Association. This Union included a large percentage of grades,from station-masters down to low-grade clerks in booking-offices.This Union was asking that the Railway Companies should give com-plete recognition to it. The Railway Executive were unanimouslyagainst conceding this demand.. The Railway Executive would not object to recognising a Union consisting only of station-masters and
other supervisory grades, but they maintained that the RailwayClerks&apos; Association, in including station-masters and similar gradesas well as ordinary clerks, undermined the discipline of the railway.There would be men occupying high positions on the railway whowould belong to the same Union as the men to whom they had togive orders. In fact, the employers would be in the same Union asthe employees an impossible situation.He supported the Railway Executive in the position they hadtaken up. He had made a suggestion, however, that the RailwayClerks&apos; Association should meet the Railway Executive and try toarrive at an agreement as to which grades should and shouldnot be allowed to join their Union. They had, however, refusedthis, and  were  calling a national  conference.Sir Eric Geddes said that this was a very important principle.The National Union of Railwaymen had never claimed to speak forany of their members who were foremen. These men, and all whohad been promoted from non-supervisory grades, were allowed toremain in the Union, but only for the purpose of receiving benefits.The Railway Clerks&apos; Association had started years ago with thevery lowest grade of clerk, but the members found that as promotioncame along the Railway Executive, before promoting them made it acondition that they should resign from their Union. If thesesupervisory grades were now recognised in the Railway Clerks&apos;Association it would result in the Trade Union running therailway. He thought the conference which Sir Albert Stanley ha.dsuggested in order to determine which grades should remain inthe Union was  bound to fail.In answer to a question by Mr. Bonar Law as to why the same principle which obtained in the National Union of Railwaymen,i.e., that the men should remain members of a Union but not take an active part, could not be applied in this case, Sir eric geddes replied that the numbers of the higher grades were muchbigger.It was pointed out that in other industries foremen and men inone workshop belonged to the same Union, and this had no deleteriouseffect on discipline.Sir Eric Geddes said that the discipline on the railways and in&apos;workshops was necessarily very different. In the former it had tobe of a very high order, and it would be impossible for station-masters to get their orders observed if the men under them belonged to the same Union.Sir David Shackleton said that if this question was fought out,and it resulted in the railway clerks having to form two or moreUnions, ail that would happen would be that these Unions wouldfederate, and in that way defeat the Government. In his opinion the Government could not face a strike on the cry that it refused to acknowledge a Union.Mr. Bonar Law thought that this strike looked less dangerousthan some of the others, but he would not like to face it if it were based on a refusal to recognise a Union. He suggested that sir Albert Stanley might protract the negotiations, and in the mean-time discuss the matter with the Minister of Labour.Sir Albert Stanley thought that only compromise would result from such a course, and in this case he saw no possibility of coin-promise. The &quot;answer had to be given immediately. The question had been underi consideration for several years. He asked if theGovernment was going to recognise this Union in face of the advicegiven by the Railway Executive.Attention Avas drawn to the fact that the Government had asked the managers to enter into negotiations with the men, and that being so the Government could hardly disregard the policy recommendedby the Railway Executive. It was important that the Glasgowtrouble should subside before entering upon a new conflict with labour.Sir Albert Stanley said that if we delayed action it would lend[826]-114 / 0
encouragement to the men, inasmuch that they - would think theGovernment would give way. It was not a question of concessionsany longer. He thought that if this came to a strike the men wouldbe beaten, as the other railway Unions would not come out in sympathy.Sir Eric Geddes also thought that a strike could be faced on thepresent issue.It was suggested that a big general strike was probably comingsooner or later, and if and when it came the strike would be on ground chosen by the Government.Sir Albert Stanley replied that he did not think this presentstrike would develop into the big conflict which was apprehended.Some discussion then took place as to the number of station-masters who now belonged to the Railway Clerks&apos; Association,but no information was available as to the exact number.Lord Reading said that if the numbers were great, then thepoint made regarding the necessity for station-masters to remainoutside the Union in order to maintain discipline would seem to be somewhat weakened.Sir R. Home said the Governments policy was to stand by theTrade Unions and support their executive authority. It was important not to object to the Union as such, but to includingparticular classes of persons in it.Sir David Shackleton said that he had worked both in theposition of a workman and a foreman, and his experience was that both grades belonging to the same Union never affected discipline,but if the Government refused to recognise this Union, it was in opposition to their avowed policy, and the Government should nottry to decide who was and who was not to be in the Union. Inhis opinion they should trust to the honour and loyalty of the men.Dr. Addison said that he agreed with the view of Sir DavidShackleton. If a considerable portion of the station-masters were.now in the Union and it had not affected the efficient working of therailways, he could not see that the Government had a case.Sir Albert Stanley &quot;pointed out that the Railway Clerks&apos;Association had been recognised for the last year or two. Thedispute now was whether it should be recognised in respect of the supervisory grades who claimed to belong to it.The War Cabinet decided- That the Government could not at the present moment inter-fere with the negotiations which were now going on, butthat, if possible, Sir Albert Stanley should prolong thenegotiations until the Prime Minister had been acquainted with the position.Municipal andother local elections:Candidates&apos;Expenses.7. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Local Government Board (G.T-6718) in respect of candidates expenses at municipal and other local elections, to whichwas attached the draft of a Bill to amend section 5 of the MunicipalElections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, by substitutingthe words &quot;3d. for each elector&quot; for the words &quot;2d. for eachelector,&quot; in the subsection prescribing the maximum amount of the. expenses of a candidate at municipal elections.The President of theLocalGovernmentBoard said that the.reasonsfor asking consent of the Government to the introduction of thesaid Bill were briefly explained in his memorandum now before theWar Cabinet. The amendment, had been urged upon him by theLondon County Council and the County Councils Association, and itappeared to him a reasonable proposal, which, in his opinion, wouldnot meet with any opposition.   He therefore asked for permission to
Local Elections in 8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the1919. President of the Local Government Board (Paper G.T.-6726) on thesubject of local elections in the year 1919. In his MemorandumDr. Addison pointed out that local elections in the United kingdom would be held in 1919 for the first time in four years. In the caseof the Municipal Boroughs and the majority of District Councils andGuardians one-third of the Councillors and Guardians retire eachyear. In addition, the Aldermen, who are co-opted by County orBorough Councils, are elected for six years, one-half of them retiringevery third year. It appeared desirable, therefore, that there shouldbe a complete new election in 1919, on the grounds particularly ofprolouged tenure of office and the presence of a new electorate. Adrafc Bill (which was annexed to the Memorandum) had beenprepared on these lines, although it was confined to the case ofCouncillors and omitted any reference to Aldermen, owing to the anticipated opposition of the Boroughs, and the fact that it was notpossible to get the Bill passed in time to affect the County CouncilAldermen.Mr. Bonar Law observed that he thought that the opinions ofthe local authorities should mainly determine the decision of theGovernment on the matter. It was a question which he thoughtcould be referred to the Home Affairs Committee.The War Cabinet decided To refer this  Bill to  the  Home  Affairs  Committee as soonas the Prime Minister had approved setting it up again.Co-ordination of 9. With reference to War Cabinet 514,  Minute 3, the WarDemobilisation. Cabinet took note  of  the  Prime Ministers  appointment of SirAuckland Geddes, as Minister in charge of the Co-ordination ofDemobilisation and the Rehabilitation of Industry, vice sir eric Geddes.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,January 31, 1919.obring in the accompanying Bill with a view to its being passed atthe earliest possible moment.Thu W ar Cabinet decided- To sanction the introduction of the proposed Bill.
