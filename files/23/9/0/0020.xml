Utilisation of I. With reference to War Cabinet 514, Minute 5, the WarNational Factories.     Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Munitionsregarding the disposal of National Factories (Paper G.T.-6782).The Minister ot Munitions stated that, in his Memorandum, hehad divided the class A factories (i.e., those which it might prove necessary to retain permanently) into two sections. Section (1)contained the three Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal aircraft establishment, and three factories for the manufacture of machine-guns, of special types of small-arms ammunition and of box-respirators,winch, in the opinion of the Secretary of State for War, should beretained definitely in Government possession and under direct government control. The fifteen factories in section (2), LordInverforth suggested might be disposed of, if favourable opportunitiespresented themselves, for diverting them to industrial purposes,subject to satisfactory conditions with regard to their re-conversionon demand to the manufacture of munitions.The Prime Minister said he would view with regret the diversion to other uses of factories such as Queensferry and Avon-mouth. He understood that in the latter sulphuric acid hadbeen produced in considerable quantities for the first time this  country. This sulphuric acid would be most useful foragricultural purposes. The continuance of its- manufacture wouldmean the development of an industry we had not hithertopossessed. Enormous expense had been incurred in setting up this factory, and he would urge that if a factory such as Queensferrywere disposed of by sale or lease, the industry associated with it-should be continued by the purchaser or lessee. &apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the list of factories which it was proposed to retain permanently, too large anumber (eg., Woolwich, Enfield, Waltham Abbey), appeared to himto be in the danger zone, and, if there was a, choice, he suggestedthat factories should be retained that were further away from theEast Coast. Political objections would be urged against the removalof Woolwich Arsenal, but, if this were not possible, the use of woolwich as a tilling factory might be discontinued. A factory ofthis kind in such close proximity to the Capital was a danger to thewrhole population of London. He agreed with the Prime minister that it was desirable to continue, by arrangement with some privatefirm, if possible, the industry begun at Queensferry.Sir James Stevenson said that, in view of probable developments in aircraft, the question of location would be of less importance infuture. If, however, filling was discontinued at Woolwich, it would leave the country without a single filling establishment.The Prime Minister then enquired what arrangements had been  made to guard these factories, and the enormous quantity ofmunitions and of guns which was distributed about the country.Sir James Stevenson said that he could give the Prime minister a complete list of the places where explosives were stored.Sir Robert Home hoped that discretion to lease the factorieswould be given to the Minister of Munitions, as their early use was important in view of the growing unemployment problem.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Munitions should proceed with the disposal ofthe factories on the principles laid down in his memorandum,subject to the following limitations : (i.) The factories at Queensferry and Avonmouthshoidd be leased or sold to firms prepared tocontiuue the manufactures now carried on there,(ii.) These two factories, and similar class A. chemicalfactories, should not be leased or sold for other industrial purposes without the consent ofthe War Cabinet being first obtained.
Proposed Industrial 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEnquiry. Minister of Reconstruction (Paper G.T.-6779), in which he suggestedthat a special enquiry into the present state of industry in this; ; country should be immediately started.The Minister of Reconstruction said he proposed to appointthree committees, with identical terms of reference: (l) composedof representatives of all sections of labour opinion (2) composed ofrepresentatives of employers, and (3) a body of technical experts ineconomics and finance. The terms of reference he suggested were asfollows:  To enquire into  (i.) The conditions of employment of the workers,(ii.) The means by which the workers may be assured of anadequate return for their labour,(iii.) The basis on which the workers should participate in thecontrol of conditions governing industrial life.The President of the Local Government Board said be was infavour of an enquiry being held, but suggested that the WhitleyCouncils and Joint Interim Reconstruction Committees, of whichthere were from fifty to sixty, should be made use of for this purpose.It would please these bodies if the Government asked them for their advice. He had not, however, found in the past that they were very helpful with constructive suggestions. Fie had obtained certain proposals from them such as the weekly half-holiday and tbe annual holiday, which questions had been before the Home Affairs Committeein September and had been deterred.The First 1,01x1 of the Admiralty said he doubted tbe desirabilityof segregating the different Committees. When Labour represen-tatives met together in the same room they were all suspicious ofeach other, and it rarely happened that they produced any usefulproposals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if three enquirieswere set up, the members would be influenced in their proposals by the tact that their suggestions would be used as the jumping-offpoint for negotiations, and this would result in neither side disclosingtheir real views, and would only lead to the putting forward ofexaggerated demands.The Minister of Reconstruction said that he hoped from these committees to get a clear statement from Labour regarding itsconstructive policy. At the present moment their policy was allcritical and negative. Even extreme proposals from the proposedLabour Committee would be useful, as they would probably becondemned by public opinion.The Minister of Labour said that he was doubtful whether thethree separate Committees would be very productive. Tbe LabourCommittee would put forward proposals not because they believed in them, but in order-to get as much as they possibly could ; there wasa danger that the Employers&apos; Committee would be reactionary, whilethe economists would be despised as academic. In his opinion theonly way was to unite tbe Committees, and he suggested that arepresentative gathering of capital and labour, such as that held atthe Caxton Hall two days after the Armistice, should be arranged.The Prime Minister might make a speech and then suggest that theemployers a.vd the workmen appoint twenty-five members each, to sit upon a Joint Committee. This Committee might appoint Sub-Committees to go into the questions of wages and hours, and be[826] 171 B 2   &apos;(iii.) The Minister of Munitions should re-examine theprovision for shell filling, in the light of theabove discussion.
Indian Reforms:Government ofIndia-Draft Bill.asked to make definite suggestions. If unanimous proposals were obtained, the Government could legislate upon them. There was a widespread demand for an enquiry of this kind. He had seen mr. Clynes on the subject, who thought that it was most desirableto appoint a representative Committee of noth sides, out of whichmight evolve a permanent Industrial Council.It was suggested that if the miners&apos; strike took place it wouldbe difficult to call such a Committee together.The Minister of Labour thought, however, that it might bepossible, provided that the railwaymen and the transport workers didnot join in the strike.The War Cabinet decided -To postpone a decision on this subject until there was more information as to the probable action of the mining andtransport Unions.3. The Secretary of State for India said that, in the KingsSpeech at the opening of the present Parliament, the hope bad been expressed that, the reports of Committees which  were now enquiringinto matters connected with Indian constitutional reform would bereceived in time to enable a Bill on the subject to be presented inthe course of the session. He had circulated to his colleagues a copyof a draft Bill to amend the Government of India Act, together witha covering note by himself (Paper G.T.-6698) (Appendix), asking that a Cabinet Committee might be appointed, with instructions torecommend to the Cabinet a Bill to be laid before Parliament as aGovernment measure. The preparation of this measure would take some time, and much preliminary work would have to be done beforethe Committee would be ready to receive the reports of the Com-mittees on the franchise, division of functions, and the India Office,which were now sitting. He did not propose to ask assent to theintroduction of a Bill before these Committees had reported.The War Cabinet decided To approve the appointment of a Committee, with terms ofreference as proposed by the Secretary of State for India,and that the following should be invited to become members of the Committee :        mr. Montagu (Chairman),Lord Curzon,. Lord Milner,Mr. Chamberlain,Mr. H. A. L. Fisher,Lord Sinha,and directed The Acting Secretary to issue the necessary invitations. &apos;The Secretary of State for India said that, if Lord Curzon andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer consented to become members ofthe Committee, it would naturally not be expected of them that theyshould attend every meeting, but only when crucial decisions had tobe taken.War Gratuities toMen in Receipt ofPensions and Payconcurrently.4. The War Cabinet had before them certain Memoranda bythe Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee (Papers G.T.-6775, 67.80and 6794) on the subject of War Gratuities to men in receipt ofpensions and pay concurrently.The Prime Minister said that he understood the papers beforethe War Cabinet had now been submitted to them because theCommittee were unable to reach a decision on the subject.    This
might be due to the fact that during Mr. Barnes&apos; absence in Paristhe duties of Chairman of the Committee had devolved upon theParliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, who was placed in the difficult position of having to adjudicate upon questions -which were,the subject of controversy between his own. department and theWar Office. Mr. Lloyd George suggested that this difficulty mightbe met by asking the Minister of Reconstruction to act as Chairmanof the Committee uutil the return of Mr. Barnes.The Minister of Reconstruction having signified his willingness to act during Mr. Barnes&apos; absence, the Chancellor of the exchequer said that he wished to submit for Sir Auckland Geddes&apos; consideration the following point. At present, papers dealing with matters underreview by the Committee were circulated to the War Cabinet, andrelegated to the Committee for decision. lie made no objection tothis course being followed, but he desired to draw the Chairman&apos;attention to the large sums which were sometimes involved and to.the fact that concessions made to the fighting services might greatlyaffect civilian arrangements, &apos; Thus the proposal before the Com-mittee for a bonus on Officers&apos; and Widows&apos; pensions would forcehim to grant a similar bonus to civil service pensioners a requestwhich he had already refused and would axld two or threemillions to our expenditure. The contention of those who madethe suggestion was that the salaries of Civil Servants hadbeen fixed with a view to enable them to live according to acertain standard of comfort appropriate to their station. Thewar bad raised the cost of living all round, and it had been represented to him that if the Government did not take this fact into consideration and make it up in some way or other totheir salaried servants, they were in effect breaking what was regarded by the latter as an unwritten contract. He had resistedthe claim, as all persons drawing fixed incomes had similarlysuffered on account of the war.Mr; Bonar Law said that, in regard to the particular question raised in the papers before the Cabinet, his own view was that, ifany bonus or gratuities were given to non-commissioned ranks, a proportionate sum must also be accorded to officers. From his knowledge of cases which came before the Officers&apos; Families Fund,be was aware that many families and dependents of deceased andserving officers were now living on the narrowest possible margin.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Reconstruction should act as Chairman ofthe Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee, with full powersof decision, during the absence of Mr. Barnes.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,February 14, 1919.
APPENDIX.[G.T.-66&apos;.)8] -I CIRC L7L ATE to my colleagues a copy of a draft bill* to amend the Governmentof India Act, which has been prepared at the Prime Minister&apos;s direction. The bill is designed to carry out the Montagu-Chelmsford Scheme of Indian Reform. It is accompanied by draftsmen&apos;s notes on clauses.1 would call my colleague&apos;s attention to the form of bill. In 1915 the Govern-ment of India Acts were consolidated with infinite labour by a joint committee ofboth Houses. Such amendments as Parliament may now make in the indian constitution it is suggested should be automatically included in the Consolidated Act.This device seems to me an admirable one which I hope it will be found possible toadopt, in order to avoid a new complication of Statutes, and, it seems to me, affords anadmirable example which could be applied in other matters for the simplification ofour Statute Book.Let me hasten to add that this hill was not drafted in order to suggest to theCabinet that it should &quot; swallow whole,&quot; and without amendment, t^he proposals ofthe Montagu-Chelmsford Report, which were published for criticism. It was draftedas a basis for discussion, as a more convenient method of deliberation than in theReport itself. I have had sitting ever since last summer an informal committee atthe India Office, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Charles Roberts, which has draftedthe bill, written and sent to me valuable notes on various aspects of the problem, andis now engaged on preparing for the Cabinet criticisms which have been received andobservations thereupon. I would ask now that these notes, the bill and the criticismsupon the scheme, should be referred to a Cabinet Committee with instructions to commend to the Cabinet a bill to be laid before Parliament as a Government measure.The preparation of this measure must take some time, and much preliminary work has to be done before the Committee will be ready to receive the reports of theCommittees on the Franchise, Division of Functions, and the India Office, which arenow sitting. But I do not propose to ask assent to the introduction of a bill before these Committees have reported to us.I would remind the Cabinet tha.t we are pledged, after the second reading of thebill, to refer to it a Select Committee of both Bouses, so that I do not anticipate a largedraft on the time of the whole of either House.E. S. M.British Delegation, Paris,January 22, 1919.* Not reproduced in this Appendix.
