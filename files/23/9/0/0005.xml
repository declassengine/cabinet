Oilfields of Papua. 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum.by Mr. Long (Paper G.T.-6642) dealing with the proposal of theAustralian Government that the British Government should co-operate with them in investigating the value of the oilfields ofPapua. In his memorandum Mr. Long stated that public feeling inAustralia was much opposed&apos; to allowing territory to be exploited byany of the large oil companies. A conference of representatives ofthe Colonial Office, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and theTreasury had agreed to recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould co-operate to the extent of 50,000Z. in a preliminary investi-gation of the potentialities of the Papuan oilfields, a similar sumbeing provided by Australia, and that the whole question should beconsidered de novo if oil were found in commercial quantities.Mr. Long stated that the Colonial Office was merely concernedin regard to the relations between the British Government and theGovernment of Australia.   It was urgently necessary to secure a supply of oil for Australia, and the possible development of oilfieldsin Papua was the only alternative to bringing oil from a long distance.    Sir Joseph Cook was confident that the  scheme   of...   . development was worth undertaking.   The Colonial Office and theAdmiralty were of opinion that .* development by &quot;big companiesoffered the greatest prospect of success, but that it was extremely-desirable that the preliminary exploration should be done by the -* joint Governments.   On the question of subsequent policy we werenot in agreement with the Dominion Government, who were opposedto the ultimate development by commercial companies.y, ... The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he attached verygreat importance to the development of the resources of the Empire,but he had hoped that the British Governments contribution of any money which it was possible to provide would go to the Protectorates&quot; and Crown Colonies, and would not be spent in the Dominions pr in territories administered by them. It was not unreasonable to expect that the Dominion Government, in a case of this kind, should undertake the charge; otherwise there would be no relief to thiscountry. He was averse from embarking on the scheme unless wecould agree in regard to ultimate policy with -the australian government.    -    i&apos;i; Mr. Bonar Law&apos; pointed out that the Colonial Office regarded the development of Imperial resources as their iomdst importantfunction, and that for that reason the matter should..be reserved for lord MilnerJs personal consideration. There should be a clear understanding that, if oil was found, the profits should not goentirely  to   the   Australian   Government.   He   hoped   that   the- t &apos; &apos;   &apos; Chancellor of the Exchequer would agree to provide the money if itwas possible to reach a satisfactory understanding.      - j1&apos;Sir Eric Geddes observed that he had been informed bySir Joseph Cook that if, after the preliminary investigation, it wasdecided to proceed, development would have to be on the lines of australian policy.Mr. Long stated that, in discussion at the Colonial Office,Sir Joseph Cook had said that if the Australian Government tooktheir share in the exploration, the subsequent arrangements must bea matter of free and frank discussion and settlement between thetwo Governments, and that, if the British Government came in, the--Australian Government were prepared to-&apos;discuss it from the Britishstandpoint.. Admiral Wemyss pointed out that a--very strong case could be...made out for,the proposal from a strategic point of view.The War Cabinet decided-To agree to the proposal, provided it were approved by the- &quot; &apos; &quot; &apos; Secretary of State&apos;for the Colonies, the First Lord of the&apos;          -       - Admiralty, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the..............understanding that definite arrangements were made to
carry out the scheme on business lines, and to share theadvantage of the enterprise between the British and australian Governments.TemporaryBuildings Occupiedby GovernmentDepartments andDischarge of temporary ClericalWorkers.3. Sir Eric Geddes said that he thought it would be desirableif Departments were asked to furnish a return with regard to thenumber of clerical workers employed by them, and the rate atwhich they expected to dischage them. He also thought it wouldbe useful if Departments could give some indication of their post-war establishments.Another matter on which he thought information was desirablewas the amount of temporary accommodation which departments could now dispense with.The War Cabinet decider! that aThe Acting Secretary should call forindicated by Sir Eric Geddes, theto the Co-ordination of Demobilisation Section.return on the linesreplies to be sent directGovernmentHousing Scheme.4. With reference to War Cabinet 364, Minute 15, attention was drawn to the various memoranda, circulated by Ministers, relatingto the different aspects of the housing problem, and it was askedwhether these memoranda were receiving consideration.The War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary should request the President of theLocal Government Board to furnish a statement on thegeneral housing position, with special reference to questionsof policy which had not yet been settled.Home AffairsCommittee.5. Attention was drawn to the fact that there were severalquestions, such as land and housing, awaiting the consideration ofthe Home Affairs Committee.The Acting Secretary pointed out that, according to instruc-tions received from the Prime Minister, the meetings of anyStanding Committees were to be suspended for the present.The War Cabinet decided that In view of the urgency of some of the problems requiring theconsideration of the Hoi \c. Affairs Committee, the ActingSecretary should that ev ?nmg communicate with the PrimeMinister in Paris, and ob ain his approval to the Committeeagain resuming its functions.-Spread of 6. The Acting Secretary of otate for Foreign Affairs said thatBolshevism. he was alarmed by the fact that no concerted action was being takenby the various Departments with regard to combating the spread of bolshevism in this country. The i spartments were working entirely on their.own, and he suggested that a Minister without portfolioshould be placed in charge, of co-ordinating the activities of thedifferent Departments in this direction.The War Cabinet decided that-The Secretary of State for the Home Department should beasked to lay before the War Cabinet his views with regardto Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestion.I * (Initialled) A.
