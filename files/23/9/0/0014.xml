With reference to War Cabinet 526, Minute 1, the HomeSecretary said that the traffic situation was less hopeful.   When he had  been come to on the previous day to use armymotor lorries, Mr. Blain, the General Manager of the LondonGeneral Omnibus company^, had stated that he did not think theuse of army lorries would cause a strike, but to-day Mr. Blain saidthat the &apos;bus drivers would probably strike if the lorries were used.The men, however, had no objection to the lorries picking upGovernment employees. The Committee on Industrial Unresttherefore felt that it would be unwise to start the lorry service onthe following day, especially in view of the fact that the TransportWorkers were holding a conference then regarding the position theywere going to take up. In answer to a question by Lord Curzonas to what reason the &apos;hus drivers would give for striking,Mr. Shortt replied that he could think of no reason other thansympathy with strike on the Underground Railway.B
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had just seen the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty, who had asked him tostate that he shared the view that the use of Government lorrieswould be interpreted as a strike-breaking act, and might cause trouble, unless carried out with care and tact. Mr. Long said,however, that, unless we acted soon, the situation would become worseand worse each day. There was no doubt that we were up against aBolshevist movement in London, Glasgow, and elsewhere. He had just returned from one of the naval ports where there had been a littletrouble, which was purely of a Bolshevist nature. It was important to note that, simultaneously with these movements here, there was achange of attitude on the part of the Germans. He had no doubtthat a skilful organisation was behind the revolt, and that the public would support the Government in putting it down with a firm hand.The Home Secretary informed the War Cabinet that if once the lot&apos;s Road power-station were started, it would be possible to runabout ten additional trains on certain lengths of line on the Metro-politan District Railway, and he had hopes of starting this power-station, the trains, and the lorries simultaneously on Friday morning.Arrangements had been made with the Admiralty to bring toLondon as soon as possible 650 stokers, and these stokers should beavailable by seven o&apos;clock on the following evening for the purposeof working at the power-stations and keeping two-thirds ofthe electricity supply going. This supply would be enough tosafeguard the street lighting, hospitals, and cold storage. A furthersource of assistance was available, and that afternoon 450 electricalstudents and 40 special constables with electrical knowledge werebeing examined. With regard to propaganda, he had asked LordBurnham to undertake this work. There had been a question as towhether the propaganda should be started on the following day oron Friday, but, on the whole, his committee had come to the conclu-sion that Friday would be the better day, in view of the fact thatthe other measures that were being taken would then begiuThe First Lord said that the Admiralty had been asked tosupply electrical mechanics. There were, however, very few ofthese available (about seventeen or eighteen), and it would be very undesirable to make use of them as they had been badlyreported upon and might refuse to obey orders. As to the stokers,the Admiralty had no doubt as to their reliability if the positionwere, rightly explained them, hut it was -essential that they shouldreceive proper protection. These men were unable to protect them-selves. Mr. Long added that the Admiralty would undertake thatno group of men would be put into any power-station, except under an officer, and it must be understood that these men were not to associate with anyone else. He would like to make it clear that theAdmiralty were not prepared to permit the use of these stokers,unless other forces of the Crown were used simultaneously.The Director of Personal Services said that, with regard to theelectricians in the army, General Robertson had grave doubts aboutemploying these men. They were waiting to be demobilised, andmany were members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.Mr. Bonar Law thought that every available means of employingvoluntary electricians should be used before these men were calledupon, and that, if it was found necessary to use them, the matter should again come before the War Cabinet. .-The First Lord then drew attention to the fact that thousands of soldiers were arriving daily in London on leave, and had nomeans of transport to the various stations to which they wished togo. He suggested that lorries might be used for this purposeimmediately, without any adverse effect on the &apos;bus drivers.The Director of Personal Services said he thought that this was already being done by the Motor Transport Volunteers, but he wouldmake enquiries.The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that there were 1,100Middlesex Motor Volunteers, who would be available for this service,if necessary.
Mr. Bonar Law asked if any steps were being taken to prepare for using the services of soldiers as &apos;bus drivers, if and when the&apos;bus drivers went on strike.The Home Secretary replied that his committee was going intothis question, but the difficulty was that a certain amount of practicewas required before men could drive a motor omnibus, and amateurdrivers might only succeed in injuring the &apos;buses and putting them out of action.It was suggested that the Royal Automobile Club could supplya number of motor volunteers, and that they might take action without being asked by the Government. Everything that showed that the public were fighting against the strike was to the good.An appeal might also be made to private owners to place their carsat the disposal of the working classes for the purpose of conveyingthem to and from their work.The Home Secretary said he understood that skilled men fromthe Air Force could be drawn on, and that they would be morereliable than the Admiralty electricians. The London ElectricityCompanies knew many of these men, and believed they could bedepended on.The Secretary of State for War stated, with regard to thesuggestion to use skilled men from the Air Force, that they werethe least disciplined and most trade-unionised of His Majesty&apos;s forces.They were not trained soldiers, and were hardly distinguishablefrom trade unionists. They were awaiting demobilisation, and not,like the men in the navy, serving a long engagement. he deprecated their use in industrial disputes, except in the last resort.On the other hand, if it were merely a question of releasing knownreliable men, that could be done at once. He understood that before orders were issued by him to any doubtful skilled men therewould be a further meeting of the War Cabinet to which he wouldbe summoned.Mr. Bonar Law said that was so. There should, however, be alist prepared of available skilled men who could and would doindustrial work. Then, if a moment arrived when the HomeSecretary thought ihey should be employed, a War Cabinet wouldhe called.The Minister of Labour said he was seeing representatives ofthe press that evening at 7 o&apos;clock, and proposed to explain to them the meaning of the regulation which had been passed that morningby Order in Council, under the Defence of the Realm Act, extending the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 to electricity.He also proposed to draw their attention to the Electric LightingAct of LS82, which provided that any person who unlawfully andmaliciously cuts or injures any electric line or work with intent to cut off any supply of electricity shall be guilty of felony, and be liable to be kept in penal servitude for any term not exceeding fiveyears. Sir Robert Home added that one favourable feature in thesituation was the fact that the Amalgamated Society of EngineersExecutive had met and suspended their district committees in glasgow, Belfast, and on the Thames, for permitting theseunauthorised strikes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it was very important to get the greatest amount possible of voluntary assistance. It mustbe remembered that we were proposing to count on the skilled artsiansin the army. We could not be certain of them; they might come in, and they might not. We were asking the War Office to do thatwhich required them to use that part of the army npon which theleast reliance could be placed. On the next day if they failedus we might ask them to quell a riot, and, having refused before,they might refuse again. He wished to impress upon the Committeeof Industrial Unrest that it was of the greatest importance to securecivilian help, and their efforts to do so should be redoubled.[826]-132 B 2
The War Cabinet decided (a.) To confirm the decision arrived at by the Industrial UnrestCommittee to use 650 naval stokers at the variousjpower-stations alter 6 p.m. on the following day, if foundnecessary, and that the Home Secretary should arrange with the Commissioner of Police and the War Office forthe employment and proper protection of these men.(6.) That the electricians in the navy and the army should notbe used except in the last resort, but that, if it wasconsidered necessary to employ them, the sanction ofthe War Cabinet should first be obtained.(c.) That the Secretary of State for War should utilise armymotor-lorries for meeting men coming home on leave,and conveying to the various railway termini.Release of IrishMen and WomenInterned in english Prisonsunder Defence ofthe RealmRegulation 14 b.2. With reference to War Cabinet 526, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chief Secretary for ireland, conveying a further message from the Lord-Lieutenant infavour of the immediate release of the Irish prisoners (Paper G.T.-6749).The First Lord said that he was of opinon that it might conceivably have been wise to release the Irish prisoners a month ago, and it might be wise to do so a month hence, but to release themnow, because the Irish Government said it was necessary, would be agreat and grave danger. He greatly feared the effect in Great Britain,when everybody was expecting the Government to use firmness indealing with the industrial unrest in England and Scotland, andwere all asking what the Government was going to do. It wouldhave a marked effect for good if it were known that the Govern-ment was going to act with decision, and it was necessary to showthat the Government were determined to stop the Bolshevistmovement. On the other hand, if the Sinn Feiners were released,for some unknown reason which the Cabinet had not before them,the moral effect on this country would be disastrous.The Secretary of State for War agreed that it would be a disastrous sign of weakness to let out the Sinn Fein prisoners atthe present time. There never was a time when it was more necessary to take every possible precaution for the public security.To release them would be taken as a sign that the Government wasterrified.The First Lord asked what was the information which had caused the Lord-Lieutenant to change his views. He had hadaccess to all sorts of information from Ireland, both secret andpublic, and he had heard nothing from any source to the effect thatde Valera and his colleagues would be likely to lead the peoplealong the right path.The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that everybody in ireland was denouncing the fact that the British Government was keepingthese prisoners locked up in England.The First Lord remarked that, while the majority did so, therewas a considerable section which differed, both in the south ofIreland as well as in the north.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been unableto understand the Viceroy&apos;s change of mind, but, as the War cabinet had placed the government of Ireland in his hands, it was difficultnot to accept the Viceroy&apos;s advice. He had, however, been much impressed by what had been said as to the effect on the situation inEngland, and suggested that the Viceroy should be told what that effect would be, and that, whatever might be the advantage toIreland of releasing those prisoners, it would be fatal to therestoration of order in England and Scotland. He would notchallenge the Viceroy&apos;s view as to what was desirable in Ireland,but would point out the inevitable effect in this country.
Lord Curzon said that, on the last occasion when it wasdecided to release Irish prisoners who had been interned, he hadyielded to the general sentiment that it was politic at the moment to create a favourable atmosphere before the Convention, and hewas convinced, on looking back, that the Cabinet had never made amore deplorable mistake, and one which he did not wish to seerepeated. He suggested that the matter could not be arranged by telephone. The War Cabinet did not know what the Viceroymeant, and it, was essential that he should come over and personallystate his case to the Cabinet. The whole country was appealingto the Government for some evidence of firmness in the presence of universal disorder. if the Government suddenly announced thatthey had released the Sinn-Fein prisoners, the effect on publicopinion would be most serious.The Home Secretary said that, in his opinion, the propermoment to release the prisoners would have been the day after thedeclaration of the poll. He was Chief Secretary at the time and he advised it, but Lord French wanted the matter adjourned. He had himself been in close touch with the Sinn Feiners in his unofficialcapacity, and knew what the various leaders were likely to accept.He had come to the conclusion that the efforts of certain leaders, ifreleased, would be valuable to the Government of Ireland, and would prove a moderating influence. They were terrified of the responsi-bility their colleagues were taking, and were very anxious to recedefrom it. From the Irish point of view, his opinion still was thatrelease might save bloodshed in Ireland, and if he were chief secretary lie would strongly press it. From the point of viewof the Home Office, he added, he did not think the adverse effect upon the English position would be as serious as was fore-shadowed, but, in view of his short experience at the Home Office,he did not wish to press that view.The First Lord thought it would be regarded as absolute mad-ness to release these men wdiile we were lighting the forces of disorder in various parts of the country.Mr. Bonar haw pointed out that, since the time Lord 1&apos;renchwent to Ireland, the responsibility of the War Cabinet had been confined to saying that he must advise and that the War cabinet would take the responsibility of supporting his policy. On theother hand, on the; merits of the present situation, he took the sameviews as his colleagues, that this was the worst possible moment,from the British point of view, to release the interned men, and thatthe one chance of the Government was to show the people that theywere going to use every possible weapon in their hands to preserveorder. Fie felt also that, as regards Ireland, the trouble in Belfastwould be enhanced by the release of Sinn F^einers. He wouldnot like summarily to reject Lord French&apos;s advice, and would prefer to speak with the Viceroy himself, if possible.The Secretary of State for War felt sure that, if a messagewere despatched to Lord French, pointing out the difficulty theGovernment were placed in by the acute situation in England, lord french would accept the explanation, and agree to bear the extraburden in Ireland.Mr. Bonar Law said that if, after he had spoken to Lord French,he still said that the retention of the prisoners would make thegovernment of Ireland impossible, he had no doubt the cabinet would take a different view.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt very strongly that, in the last resort, Lord French should come over and state his case before it was decided to release the prisoners.The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that he desired to emphasise the fact that the great difficulty was that the men had never been convicted ; they were simply interned and deported, without convictionor trial.  On all other occasions, men had been imprisoned after trial.The First Lord pointed out that there were more than a
hundred other cases of men interned without trial under the Defenceof the Realm Regulation 14 b. ; he asked whether it was proposedto release them, as they seemed to be in the same position.The Home Secretary said that there was a difference. InIreland section 1 of the Defence of the Realm Act was suspended,and it was only necessary to suspect a man of being about todo an act hostile to the State in order to authorise his internment.The First Lord pointed out that Englishmen interned undersection 14 b of the Defence of the Realm Act were examined by a judicial committee after internment. The same privilege had been offered to the Irish, but they had refused it.The Chief Secretary for Ireland asked what reply would be givenin Parliament if reference were made to the release of John MacLean,as distinguished from the continued imprisonment of the sinn feiners.The First Lord reminded the Cabinet that, at the time whenJohn MacLean&apos;s case was under discussion, the decision was that hewas not to be released if the Viceroy objected, and the Viceroy had agreed that his release would not make any difference to the irish situation.Mr. Bonar Law undertook to discuss the situation with theLord-Lieutenant.(Initialled) A.
