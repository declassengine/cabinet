Arms Traffic. 1. The War Cabinet had before them the Report of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Arms Traffic(Paper P.-13) ; a Memorandum by the Foreign Office (paper g.T.-6875), to which was attached a Draft Convention for thecontrol of arms traffic ; and tne Report of an Inter-departmental conference, held at the India Office on the 24th February, 1919(P.-108), which had met to consider a telegram from the british delegation in Paris (No. 327) to the War Cabinet, requesting anearly decision of the Cabinet on the subject, as negotiations with theFrench to secure their adhesion to the draft of the Arms Conven-tion were about to open.Sir Thomas Holderness stated that he had been the Chairmanof the Inter-Departmental Conference, and briefly explained therecommendations made in the Conference^ Report. The conference had to consider whether the policy embodied in the Report of the arms Committee was to prevail, or whether realisation of Britishsurplus stocks was to continue. If disposal was to be allowed at all,it was desirable to determine what safeguards would have to be insisted upon. The Conference found that the only existing contractat present with the Ministry of Munitions was one to supplyguns, &amp;c, to the United States Government to the value of ,0O0,0O0L, but negotiations were proceeding, for the supply ofarms, &amp;c, from surplus stocks to various neutral Governments.In the Foreign Office memorandum a suggestion had beenmade that the Conference over which he had presided should,in default of any other solution, draw up two lists, (a) of countries to which war material might be sold regardless of its nature, (6) of war material which might safely be sold regardless ofthe country of destination. In respect of these suggestions theConference had been faced with the difficulty that certain countries could not be trusted not to re-sell arms purchased by them touncivilised races. A further proposal had been made, to the effectthat guns, and gun ammunition, and possibly bombs, and machine guns should be left out of the Convention, and that in regard to these the League of Nations might impose a universal rationing system.Mr. Bonar Law said that he thought that the United states would never agree to the unrestricted sale of guns and ammunition,especially to Latin America. The best way, in his view, would besimply to confine the Convention to small arms, to which there shouldbe no difficulty in obtaining the concurrence of the United States.The Minister of Munitions, in reply to a question, said that his department naturally was very anxious to see the surplus stocks sold.Lord Curzon said that the problem originally arose out of the arms traffic in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The situation was now complicated by the enormous amount of material that existed. Inthe old days we had received no assistance from France in stopping the traffic, but both France and the United States were now so frightenedabout the consequences of great quantities of arms getting into the wrong hands that they were willing to make common cause with us.The War Cabinet decided : (a.) That the terms of the  Draft Convention  should be soamended as to refer to and include small arms and small arms ammunition only ;(b.) That, consequently, article 3 should stand, and that theproposed amendment  of the  Inter-Departmental Con-ference of this article need not be accepted ;(c.) That article 4 of the Convention should be amended byomitting everything following the words &quot; all destina-tions &quot; in line 2 ;(d.) To add at the end of article 5 the words, &quot; which will satisfyitself in each case that the arms and ammunition arerequired for a legitimate purpose.&quot;(e.) To delete in Article 25 the words &quot; and raw materials forexplosives.&quot;
1J32. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Shipping Controller (Paper G.T.-6922) with reference to theshipping which would be required to transport munitions of war tothe Black Sea for the assistance of General Denekin, in which it was stated that additional tonnage to the extent of 150 per cent, of thathitherto,, indicated would be required, involving the use of sometwenty or more ships of 5,000 tons, that, owing to the shortage oftonnage, the Shipping Controller considered the demand as veryserious, and that, if the work were to be undertaken, Italy andFrance should be called upon to give at least equal assistance, as an allied responsibility.The Secretary of State for War said that the shipping he askedfor would not all be required at once, but he wished to avoidsuccessive delays in obtaining ships from time to time as they were required. An Inter-Departmental Committee, which had just metunder Lord Curzon&apos;s Chairmanship, had decided to recommend tothe War Cabinet a threefold policy in the Caucasus (i.) To make preparations to withdraw ;(ii.) To compensate General Denekin for our withdrawal bysupplying him with material and munitions of war, andwith a military mission as proposed ;(hi.) To make it a condition of such support that general denekin should not interfere with the Georgians andother independent States in the Caucasus.He regarded the supply of arms to General Denekin as a lever, onthe one hand, to enable him to fight the Bolsheviks, and, on theother, to prevent him from maltreating the Southern States; andthe supply of this material was. therefore an essential part of thescheme for removing our troops as quickly as possible. He proposedto spread the supply over the next few months, doling it out toGeneral Denekin according to his requirements. It was necessary toretain the power to control him if he did not fall in with our wishes.Mr. Churchill hoped that the Shipping Controller would be willingto supply the shipping within the next few months, in order thatthe War Office might carry out a coherent policy with regard to theCaucasus. It was useless to invite either the French or the americans to provide the shipping, as General Denekin came solelywithin the British sphere, though he agreed that the fact that wewere supplying the shipping for the Caucasus was a point whichshould be raised in regard to other claims by the Allies for shipping-assistance from this country ; for example, the transport of GeneralHaller&apos;s army to Poland. Moreover, the demand for twenty shipments of 5,000 tons did not involve the employment of twenty ships for more than a single voyage. The transport of this material wouldbe spread over some months, and it was quite possible that only a quarter of that number of ships would be required, each ship makingseveral journeys. The evacuation of the British troops could not take place for some months, owing to the necessity of withdrawingtroops from distant points, such as Trans-Caspia and Krasnovodsk,and moving them along the Baku railway to Batum. Mr. Churchillpointed out that the scheme advocated was the only practicable oneto carry out the policy of evacuation consistently with our obligations to the Southern peoples, and the necessity for covering the withdrawalof our own troops. It was essential to support General Denekin, for if he were to break down our troops would be cut off by the Bolsheviks.General Denekin was a great shield to our troops along the whole ofthe line.Lord Curzon concurred in Mr. churchill&apos;s observations with[826]-308 B 2Assistance toGeneral Denekin.And directed The Acting Secretary to reply to telegram No. 327 from theSecretary to the British Delegation in the above sense.
regard to the evacuation of troops, and pointed out that it could notbe carried out hurriedly, but mus&apos; be progressive, and might be attended by disorder and bloodshed, owing to fighting betweenthe local populations in consequence of our withdrawal. We wererelying on General Denekin to fight and beat the Bolsheviks.He had shown a tendency, however, to turn southward and attack the States on the other side of the Caucasus as an easiertarget. He was a type of the old-fashioned monarchical Russianwho regarded it as his natural role to bring back the CaucasusStates under Russian rule. Lord Curzon said that he was entirely in agreement with the Secretary of State for War thatit wras necessary to retain control over General Denekin throughthe supply of material, which should be used to carry out his realobject of attacking in the north, but not in the south.The Shipping Controller stated that the shipping position was becoming more serious every day. New proposals were continuallybeing put up. Already eighteen ships were asked for to transportmaterial to the Black Sea, and it was now proposed to increase this number by 150 per cent. He protested that the British Governmentshould not be required to furnish all the ships needed for transport.Ships which had recently been taken from the Austrians by theItalians, and were intended to be under the control of the Allies, werebeing used by the Italians for a great Libyan expedition. Therewere heavy demands for tonnage for bringing wheat from Australia,and ships would shortly be required to supplement the wheat supplyof India. In addition, there were over 400 ships round the coastrequiring repairs, which it had not been possible to execute owing tothe shipbuilding strike ; while, owing to the possibility of coal trouble,it had been necessary to divert tonnage to build up stocks of coal inour coaling stations. It was quite impossible for him to carry outproperly shipping programmes if constant new demands were sprungupon him suddenly by the War Office.The Secretary of State for War protested that it was becoming increasingly difficult to carry out any coherent policy, owing toobjections raised by the Shipping Controller and the Treasury. TheWar Office had tried very hard to devise a scheme within the limitslaid down by the Cabinet. Moreover, with the withdrawal of our forces in the Caucasus, an enormous drain upon shipbuilding wouldbe removed. All he asked at present was that the Cabinet shouldapprove the continued despatch of these stores, and to leave it tohim to arrange with the Shipping Controller, so far as possible, tomake the necessary provision.Lord Curzon observed that the assistance for General Denekinwould go on for some months. It must be spread over a prolonged period, and he did not think the strain on the Ministry of shipping would be as great at the present moment as Sir Joseph Maclayfeared.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the Secretary of State for war should arrange for somebody in the War Office to have the function of investigating the War Office shipping requirements,and of discussing them some time in advance with the ShippingController.Mr. Churchill said that Sir Sam Fay was already doing that.Sir Joseph Maclay said that he assumed it was understoodthat we should endeavour to get Allied ships for the purpose, should it be possible.&quot;The War Cabinet decided that  The Shipping Controller should confer with the Secretary ofState for War, and should endeavour to do everything possible to provide the shipping necessary to carry out theWar Cabinefs decision as to the transport of the material to the Black Sea for the support of General Denekin, onthe understanding that the provision of supplies would bespread over a period of several months.
Use of Warshipsfor the conveyance of Troops.Ministry of Health. 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the President of the Local Government Board (Paper G.T.-6860),in which the War Cabinet were askeu to agree to a definite ruling (a.) That no Department of State should create a new medicalbranch within its own province;(6.) That no Department of State should expand an already existing medical branch or make new medical appoint-ments, or establish a revised scale of medical salaries.without the concurrence of the President of the Local GovernmentBoard.After some discussion between the Minister of Pensions and theParliamentary Secretary of the Local Government Board, Mr. bonar law suggested that the proposals in Dr. Addison&apos;s memorandumwent further than the case required, and that it would be sufficientif the Minister of Health were consulted before higher medicalappointments were made in any branch of a Department which was liable to be transferred to the Ministry of Health. If, on the onehand, this arrangement were found burdensome by the department concerned, or if, on the other, the Minister ot Health found thatappointments were being made to the prejudice of the administra-tion of the branch when it was transferred to him, the matter couldbe brought before the Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided that An instruction should be issued to all Departments, which were liable to be transferred to the Ministry of Health, that important appointments of medical officers should only bemade after consultation with the Minister of Health.Supreme Economic 5. With  reference   to   War   Cabinet   535,   Minute   6,   andCouncil. Paper  I.C.-136,   Minute 5, the War Cabinet took note  of, and approved, the following decision of the British Empire Delegation(Paper B.E.D.-10, Minute 1) on the subject of the SupremepCconomicCouncil :-(a.) That the Supreme Economic Council should be constituted,as regards the British Empire, on the panel system, withfive representatives for Great Britain,  the Dominions,3. With reference to War Cabinet 537, Minute 7, the WarCabinet further considered a suggestion made by the ShippingController that warships should be used for the transport of troops,as was beiriir done by the American Government.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that he had gone very carefully into the matter with his Naval Advisers, and had come tothe conclusion that it was impossible to use warships for the purpose,owing to the limited accommodation on board. He had no knowledge of how the Americans contrived to do it, but after very careful enquiry he was convinced that it was not a practicableproposal.The Shipping Controller said that he found it very difficult tobelieve that it was not possible to make use of warships for thepurpose.The War Cabinet decided that The First Lord of the Admiralty should summon a meeting ofhis Naval Advisers, which representatives of the Ministry ofShipping should be invited to attend, in order that thematter might be further explored, having regard inparticular to the use being made by the AmericanGovernment of their warships for the transport of troops.
and India. Lord Robert Cecil would be the principalBritish Delegate on the Council; .(b.) That, instead of having two Committees, one British andone Dominions and India, to advise the British represen-tatives on the Supreme Economic Council, as had beenagreed by the War Cabinet on the 24th February, thereshould be one British Empire Economic Committee, with lord Robert Cecil as Chairman;(c.) That Mr. J. A. Salter should be Secretary of the EconomicCommittee, and that he should be assisted by membersof the staffs of the Dominion and Indian Delegations onthe panel system, as in the case of the Secretariat ofthe British Empire Delegation.Gratuties to 6.  With reference to War Cabinet 514, Minute 1, the WarTemporary Naval      Cabinet approved the following decision of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos;eeis&quot; Pay Committee on the subject of gratuities for temporary officersof the Royal Navy (Paper G.T.-6907) :-That the gratuity to temporary naval officers should be on thesame scale as that granted to temporary officers of theArmy under article 497 of the Royal Warrant, viz/: 124days&apos; pay for the first year of service, and 62 days&apos; pay foreach succeeding year or part of a year of service.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,March 6, 1919.
