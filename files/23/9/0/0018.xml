The Food Situation 1. With reference to War Cabinet 530, Minute 4 (6), the WarCabinet had before them memoranda by the Food Controller (PapersG.T.-6773 and (5783) on the general food situation.The Food Controller stated, in bis memoranda, that he had badunder bis consideration the question of revoking the Food HoardingOrder, so as to increase the distribution of foodstuffs in the interiorof the country and to relieve the congestion of the ports. He hadalready granted certain concessions to householders, but did notconsider it advisable to go further- at the present time. Any further relaxation of the Order might seriously interfere with the equality of distribution, and act to the prejudice of the less well-to-do membersof the community in loc lit:es where, for any reason, there was atemporary shortage of any commodity ; nor did he think that suchrelaxation would materially relieve this congestion at the ports,which was due to the great increase of imports consequent upon the cessation of hostilities, inland difficulties of transport, and theshortage of labour both at the ports and warehouses.Sir, Norman Hill said that, at the present moment, the portswere stored to their utmost capacity, and it was impossible for themto hold any more stocks. He had been informed that all storage facilities in the country were already taxed to their utmost limit, sothat they could not be expected to afford any relief to the congestedports.It was generally agreed that the present congestion of the portswas a serious matter, in view of the fact that industrial unrestmight at any motiient make it difficult to relieve these ports of their accumulated stocks, and it was thought that some system should be devised by the Ministry of Food by which it would be possible toincrease the present storage accommodation in the large inlandcentres.The President of the Board of Trade said that, should anythinghappen to the railways, it would be difficult to arrange facilities forthe stocks at the ports to be distributed in the usual manner. Iffacilities could be found in the bm- inland towns for the storao-e offood, he thought it would greatly relieve the situation at the ports.The War Cabinet decided that The Shipping Controller, in conjunction with the Minister ofFood, should examine the possibility of relieving thepresent congestion at the ports by distributing the accuniu-lated stocks among the various inland centres.The Meat Situation. 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by Sir-Thomas Bobinson (Paper G.T.-6781) in which he suggested that theMinistry of Food should increase the civilian meat ration, and reducethe price of meat.The Minister of Food said that he was in favour of this proposal,and had already appointed a Committee to go into the question ofthe lowering of prices, but this might result, in his having to make a heavy call upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped that newfood subsidies, like that which had been given for wheat, would notbe considered. This was, however, a different question from theGovernment cutting its loss on the existing stocks. The whole subject required very close examination.The War Cabinet decided that A Committee, with the Food Controller as Chairman, should beappointed to examine the possibility of reducing the pricesof food. The Committee should be convened by theMinistry of Food and, in addition to representatives of theMinistry, should include representatives of the Board of
Financial Provisionfor the Greek Armyduring 1919.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the Treasury (Paper G.T.-6611) on Financial Provision for tbeGreek army during- 1919.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that, at an Inter-Allied Conference held in November last, under the presidency of&quot;Lord Milner, this question of financial assistance had been postponed until information could be obtained as to the probability of the demobilisation of the Greek forces. Since that time no militarydecision had been taken, and, the existing Agreement having expiredon the last day of 1918, the Treasury bad madeConference with the French Treasury and witarrangements for ah representatives ofthe American Treasury in Paris early in L919.     Tbe British repre-omConference pending instructions frsentative was holding up this the War Cabinet on certain points. The project of the french general Staff to embark two Greek divisions to Odessa for use inRussia raised the question of responsibility for supplies to these forces, which would be employed under General Franchet d&apos;Espereyin the French sphere of operations. We were not concerned in theemployment of&quot; Creek troops at Odessa, and, in his opinion, ought not to take any responsibility for financing: them.Bonar &quot;Law said that up to the end of the war we were respon-i the French and Americans for tbe finances of the. Bsible jointly witlGreek army.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the cost duringL918 had amounted to 35,000,000L, of which tbe Americans had found 5,000,000Z., tbe remainder being shared between the Frenchand ourselves. It was improbable that the Americans would con-tribute further, and certain that they would not contribute to theexpenses of the troops in Russia.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that this was amatter of high policy, and it would depend upon the decisions theAllies took as to intervention in Russia, If we were not going to intervene, we should not be called upon to bear the expense.The Prime Minister said that the Allies were determined not, to intervene in Russia. There was not a single advocate of inter-vention amongst the Allies. Before coming to a decision Mr. Balfourshould be consulted, as it was most undesirable to tie Mr. Balfour&apos;shands. He suggested that Lord Curzon should telegraph to theForeign Secretary, explaining that, subject to any observations hehad to make, it was proposed to instruct the British representative in the sense indicated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Lord Curzon said that he understood these Greek divisions hadaheadv landed at Odessa.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Greektroops had landed in Russia. With regard to stores, it had beenarranged that we should land these at Salonica, from where theFrench undertook to ship them to Russia.Mr. Bonar Law said that be bad given instructions a monthbefore to stop payment, and he did not think any money had been paid since then.   The Greeks were, however, using our stores.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the next point uponwhich instructions were desired was with regard to demobilisation ofthe Greek army. The Greeks had expressed a desire to demobilisetheir forces as soon as possible, unless the Allies wished the contrary.He suggested that the War Cabinet should express themselves iafavour of the Greek armybeingdemobilised  as soon as possible,Trade, the Board of Agriculture, and the Treasury, and two members of the Consumers&apos; Council.The War Cabinet took note of the fact that the Food Controllerproposed shortly to increase the present civilian meat ration, assupplies became available.
and should add that the British Government would be responsiblefor financing it only during the transitional period.The Prime Minister pointed out that this was a militaryquestion, and that before deciding we ought to know the probable effect of the demobilisation of the Greek army.The Secretary of State for War said that we were demobilisingour own army very rapidly. It was considered that we requiredabout 175,000 men to hold the places in the Mediterranean and russia which we now occupied. Our own troops were being steadilydiminished. In the circumstances, was it wise to limit the numberof Greek troops in this area who could relieve our own men while our policy was still undecided ? One division of British troops hadbeen sent to the Dobrudja. The Greeks could very well be thereinstead of us.It was suggested that this was a question for the Allies to settlegenerally at Paris, and that it was not for the War Cabinet to takethe initiative. Further, the Greek troops would probably be of little use anywhere in the Balkan area as they would only createtrouble.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he under-stood that it had been decided that the Allies were not to go toOdessa. The Greeks, however, were there, and he thought that itwas a question for the Supreme War Council.The War Cabinet decided that Until the general military position had been cleared up and theAllied policy in Russia more definitely settled theinstructions issued by Mr. Bonar Law should hold good.The Situation in. 4. The Secretary of State for War said that we were committed inRussia. various directions in Russia.    We had forces both in the north andin the south of Russia, and in Siberia.   The men there were entitledto know what they were fighting for, and were entitled to proper.      , support from home.    Our enterprises in all these directions werecrumbling. The situation in the north was not yet serious, althoughit might very easily become so. The Bolsheviks were gettingstronger every day. In the South, General Denekihs army badgreatly deteriorated. Krasnoff was discouraged, and believed theAllies had thrown them over completely. The situation in Siberiawas exactly the same. There was complete disheartenment every-where. The Great Powers were still delaying the decision on thismatter. If we were going to withdraw our troops, it should be done at once. If we were going to intervene, wc should send larger forces there.    He believed that we ought to intervene.The Prime Minister said he understood the military view to bethat, if we were going to do any good., we should need a million menat least, and these should be despatched in the spring.Mr. Churchill, continuing, said that he did not suggest inter-vention on that scale, but we ought to try and keep alive theRussian forces which were attempting to make headway against theBolsheviks.The Prime Minister said there were various courses open. Asregards intervention, in order to be successful it was necessary tohave a million men advancing from Odessa or through Poland.Another policy was to supply the Russian forces with guns, equip-ment, &amp;c, but every opinion he had heard expressed was to theeffect that guns alone would be of no use, as it would be necessary to&apos; send in addition at least 150,000 men.The Secretary of State for War said that he agreed that inter-vention on a large scale was not possible, but we ought to continueto help the&apos; anti-Bolshevik forces in Russia., as much as we could.The alternative was to withdraw at once.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as he understood theposition, the chances of any good results had greatly diminished inthe last few weeks. The anti-Bolsheviks in Russia had expected far more help than the Allies had sent them. Our information now wasthat both Denekin&apos;s and Krasnoffs forces were untrustworthy. TheEnglish troops in Siberia were very tired, and the Czechs were lesswilling to fight. With regard to Archangel, the Russian forces therewere useful as a fighting force only in conjunction with the Allies,and the position appeared to be serious. With regard to Odessa, be referred to a telegram from Lord G-ranville, dated the 19th January,1919, announcing the despatch of Greek troops to Odessa (No. 55).M. Venizelos wished to demobilise his army, but, in order to retaintire good will of the Allies, was prepared to allow them to serve inRussia. As it was, 41,000 Greek troops were under orders to goto Odessa, of whom 3,000 were already on the spot. If they got into trouble, it would be impossible for France and England to leave them to their fate, and we mio-ht be involved at any moment agrainstour will.The Prime Minister said that he would like to have the military point of view on the question of the various alternatives which were before the Government. He had already indicated two possiblepolicies, namely, that of intervention and that of supplying theRussian forces with guns and money. He would like to know what this latter policy meant how much money it would mean, andwhether it would involve sending more forces. There was a thirdpolicy, namely, to withdraw altogether. He would like to know alsowhat it would mean, from the military point of view, if we had todefend those States which would come under the protection of theLeague of Nations. In reply to a question, he said that Siberia wasnot amongst these States, as it did not now claim independence.The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office wouldprepare a paper on this question, lie thought that, if we came tothe conclusion that if we had no effective means of helping these people, the sooner tin;1.&apos; were told the better it would be. On theother baud, if the Allies would not be!]) Russia, Japan and germany would certainly do so, and in a few years&apos; time we should see theGerman Republic united with the Bolsheviks in Russia and theJapanese in the Far East forming one of the most powerful combi-nations the world had ever seen.The Prime Minister said that the Russian non-Bolshevik armieswere inferior to the Bolsheviks neither in men nor guns, and if theRussian p ipulatiou had been behind them they would certainly havemade headway. For months the Bolsheviks had had none of the essentials of a disciplined army, vet the Russians had made noe ffecti ve ; u iv; 11 i ce.Lord Curzon said at present there was no doubt that theBolsheviks were in the ascendant militarily, ami we had to consider how far we were responsible for this. The Czechs maintained thatthe&apos; position was due largely to the lack of decision and uncertainty of the Allied policy. As regards the non-Bolshevist groups insideRussia, there was no doubt they considered the invitation to theConference at Prinkipo as a recognition of the Bolshevik Govern-ment on an equality with themselves. The Prime Minister had put before them three policies. That of a determined and thorough-goiug intervention was held to be impossible. Before deciding onthe other extreme, a complete withdrawal, the War Cabinet shouldbe perfectly clear that they were doing all they could in what hewould call the bolstering policy. In any case, we could only provideforces for Russia by means of volunteers, not only British volunteersbut men of other nationalities. M. Scavenius had mentioned to him the possibility of getting Swedish volunteers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the question offinance had to be considered.    President Wilson had made it clearthat he was opposed to intervention of any kind, and the United[826]-160 C
States would take no financial responsibility, so that France andGreat Britain between them would have to sustain the whole cost.The First- Lord drew attention to a letter from Colonel JohnWard, which bad appeared in the press, and which he said had madea great stir in the country. It conveyed the impression that themen in Siberia, had been forgotten.Lord Curzon said that a Blue Book was being prepared at theForeign Office, containing an account of the Bolshevik activities inBussia.The Secretary of State for War said he thought the War office should be definitely instructed as to the policy to be pursued. Theyshould fie told either to intervene or to help the Russian forces withguns and equipment, or to withdraw.The Prune Minister said that no alternative plans had been sub-mitted to the War Cabinet. He thought that a, paper should besubmitted showing the military effect of the alternative policies. Inaddition, he would like to know the extent of the obligation we had undertaken in promising the protection of such States as Poland,Esthonia, and Lithuania. This was an obligation which america had also undertaken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said there was also a politicalfactor to be taken into consideration. He understood that no onebelieved that the non-Boishevik Governments in Russia could by themselves stand for a moment.The Prime Minister, continuing, said he would like to have theWar Office Paper, which the Cabinet had now decided to ask for,in time for discussion on the next day. A request could then bemade that it should be discussed in Paris on Friday. Re thought itwas essential that this matter should be decided before PresidentWilson left for America on Saturday. It was a question whichcould not be decided here in London, but they could send an expression of their opinion to Paris.The War Cabinet decided that: The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should prepare a state-ment showing the military ehect which would ensue fromthe adoption of each of the following policies with regardto Prussia : (i.) Intervention,(ii.) Evacuation.(hi.) A middle policy of giving all possible help by wayof arms and money to the anti-Bolshevik Govern-ments of Russia.(iv.) The defence of all those States which depended upon the Great Powers for their protection.The Baltic 4a. Admiral Fremantle gave the War Cabinet certain informa-tion as to the position in the Baltic Provinces. He said that in finland&apos; the situation was very promising. They were actuallycontemplating a raid on Petrograd, and some men had been pushedacross the Gulf of Finland. The Letts, also, were showing activity.They had already mobilised their officers, and were trying to mobilisetheir men.At the request of the Prime Minister, Admiral Fremantleundertook to furnish Mr. Lloyd George with a statement giving such information as was in the possession of the Admiralty in respect ofthe situation in the Baltic Provinces.British naval assistance to north Eussia.
Proposed Abolition 6. The War Cabinet had under consideration two memorandaof Censorship. ,)y thg  presicient of  tlie Board of Trade vG.T.-6493  and  6678Jand a. memorandum by the Postmaster-General (G.T.-G725),recommending the abolition of the censorship) of telegrams and letters.The President of the Beard of Trade said that he was asking for the abolition, or relaxation, of the censorship in the interestsof the trade of the country. The Hoard of Trade had been urged by a number of the Chambers of Commerce to press for the relaxation of censorship restrictions. The development of theexport trade to its pre-war condition was hindered, not only bythe delay involved in censoring, but also by the expenditure incurred in sending open messages in place of the abbreviatedcommercial codes employed before the war.Lt was pointed out that the continuance of the censorship was.vital to the maintenance of the blockade, and unless it was decidedto abandon the blockade, the censorship must be maintained.The Postmaster-General said that, if Government departments would, wherever possible, communicate by letter instead of by cable,it would make a great difference to the business community. A verylarge number of cables were being sent by Government Departmentsmany of which, in his opinion, could be sent by post. He addedthat, as an example, on a recent occasion the Government telegramsfor one day had occupied the Pastern Telegraph Company&apos;s lines fora day and a quarter.The War Cabinet decided on the advice of the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary of State for War concurring that it was premature to abolish the censorship.Proposed closing of the Press-Bureau.7. The War CabinetSecretary (G.T.-G742) inBureau should be closed.considered a memorandum by thewhich it was proposed that   theHomePressThe War Cabinet decided that, in view of their decision thatthe censorship must be maintained it, was necessary thatthe Press Bureau should continue.Blockade and the 8. Air. Cecil Harmsworth requested that it be brought to theUnited States of notice of President Wilson that attempts were being made in certainAmerica. quarters not only to lift the censorship, but also to break down theblockade. The situation in regard to blockade matters would beprecarious until the Supreme War Council decided that the blockadewas no longer necessary.The Prime Minister suggested that Lord Robert Cecil, who wasin close touch with President Wilson in connection with the Leagueof Nations, should be directed to discuss the matter with him.The President of the Board of Trade asked whether it was agreedthat we must make every attempt to maintain the blockade.Lord Curzon stated that he had had a strong appeal from lord derby not to allow- any relaxation of the blockade against Germany,provision for sucli shipping as may he, necessary for river operations in North Russia, upon the opening of navigation.The War Cabinet decided to sanction the provision of theshipping for which authority was requested (vide concluding paper of Paper G.T.-G752).
which he regarded as our chief weapon in maintaining control over that country.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that if we were unable to weaken the blockade, it would place our manufacturers in a difficult position.We must not make it too difficult to export manufactured goods from this country.Mr. Chamberlain was of the same opinion, and hoped that thePresident of the Board of Trade would do everything possible topermit the export of goods to neutral countries. He drew particular attention to the case of exporting coffee to Sweden. While weshould continue to prevent exports to Germany, it was urgently necessary to encourage exports to neutral countries.The War Cabinet decided that :  (1.) The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldrequest Lord Robert Cecil to discuss with PresidentWilson the necessity for maintaining the censorship of communications to South America, and for not relaxing the blockade against Germany.(2.) That the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Blockadeshould do everything possible to encourage the export ofgoods to neutral countries consistently with the main-tenance of the blockade against Germany.Chairmanship ofCommittee onPhysical KesearchInstitution.9. Lord Curzon requested the authority of the War Cabinetto relinquish the Chairmanship of the Committee on a PhysicalResearch Institution for the navy, to which he had been appointedby the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 479, Minute 12). Owing to theheavy duties entailed by his work as Acting-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, he found it impossible to devote sufficient time to thework of the Committee. Mr. H. A. L. Fisher was willing to under-take the Chairmanship of this Committee, and was anxious to haveSir Auckland Geddes associated with him on the Committee.Lord Curzon added, in reply to a request by Mr. Churchill thatthe Air Ministry should be represented, that the Air Ministry was already represented on the Committee.The War Cabinet authorised the appointment of Mr. H. A. L.fisher as Chairman of the Committee, with Sir auckland geddes as Vice-Chairman.Forthcoming Bills 10. The War Cabinet directed the Acting-Secretary that copiesin Parliament. of Bills about to be introduced into Parliament should be circulated in order that they might be discussed as earh&apos;- as possible, and requested that the Bill for the Ministry of Ways and Communicationsshould be circulated at once.Gibraltar-Oeuta 11.
