Opening ofParliament.The King&apos;s Speech.1. THE War Cabinet had under consideration a draft of theKing&apos;s Speech for the forthcoming Opening of Parliament.After some discussion the War Cabinet decided that The draft Speech, in its amended form (Appendix), should besubmitted to His Majesty the King and to the privy council for delivery by His Majesty on the occasion of theOpening of the n^w Parliament on the following clay.Government Bills. 2. Mr. Bonar Law informed the War Cabinet that it was usual,at the Opening of Parliament, to give a list of certain Bdls whichthe Government proposed to place before the House during the session. The following list which related to - Bills ready forimmediate action have been received from the Chief Whip&apos;s office : Housing Bill.Land Acquisition Bill.Land Settlement Bill.Health Ministry Bill.Re-election of Ministers Bill.Ways and Communications Bill.Civil Flying Bill; and army of Occupation Bill.The War Cabinet decided To delete from the list the Bill relating to Civil Flying, and to add to the list the War Pledges Bill.Strike situation in belfast.3. With reference to Wax Cabinet 525, Minute 7, the chief secretary for Ireland said that he had received a teleo-ram fromBelfast to the effect that it was proposed to make immediate use oftroops for Q&apos;as and electric works, and that the Commander-in-chief in Ireland had dissented from this proposal. Mr. Macpherson saidthat the Lord Mayor would not take any responsibility upon himselffor calling for volunteers or for soldiers to protect them. He(Mr. Macpherson) had already urged that the situation should bedealt with in a manner similar to that adopted&apos; in Glasgow, and hehad suggested that volunteers should be enrolled to carry on theessential services of the city.   Nothing had, however, been done.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, although theauthorities in Ireland had always shown apathy in dealing with a situation of this kind, one should not forget that the Lord Mayorof Belfast was in a different position from the Lord Provost ofGlasgow, inasmuch as the Irish Constabulary was a GovernmentForce, and totally different from the Municipal Police in thiscountry. The attitude of dependence on the Government hadsteadily increased during the past 20 years.It was suggested that the Lord Mayor of Belfast should form aJoint Committee, consisting of members of the Belfast corporation and Government officials, to consider what could be done to meetthe situation.The War Cabinet approved of the formation of a Joint StrikeCommittee in Belfast, and the Chief Secretary undertook to send an official from Dublin to Belfast in order to takethe organisation in hand.Steps to MeetPossible coal strike.4. The Home Secretary stated   that  the  Industrial UnrestCommittee had met that morning, and was taking steps to meet thesituation that would arise in the event of a coal strike.     TheCommittee had considered that it was desirable to build up stocks of
Mr. Chamberlain suggested that an enquiry should be held intothe possibility of lowering food prices. We had large stocks ofcertain commodities, and lie thought we might possibly lose more money by selling these goods at a price which would recoup theGovernment lor the amount they iiad paid for the goods than weshould by throwing the goods on the market. He wished, if possible,to break the world marker, prices.The First Lord said that he apologised for bringing the questionof more beer before the Cabinet again, but, although the Cabinet had authorised increased supplies, the beer was not available, and hethought there must be a hitch somewhere.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Coal Controller, in conjunction with the ShippingController, should arrange for a reduction in the exportsof coal to France, Italy, and Scandinavia.(6.) The Food Controller should be requested to report on thegeneral food situation, the possibility of liberating stockson a large scale, and on the distribution of beer, at theMeeting of the War Cabinet on Wednesday next, the12th February, 1919.(c.) The Committee on Industrial Unrest should examine the suggestions made by the Prime Minister and enumeratedabove.[8261-191coal by the diversion of a portion of the exports at present destined for France, Italy, and Scandinavia.The Prime Minister said that he agreed with this proposal, andbe thought it was important to have available every possible ounceof coal. He had given a good deal of consideration to thepossibility of the miners attempting to hold up the life of thecommunity, and if they chose starvation as a weapon they mustnot complain if society made use of the same weapon. We could,control the bread and foreign supplies, and we had sufficient troops toguard the main centres, but he was a little anxious as to the pro-tection of herds of cattle in the open country.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the navy had amplesupplies of coal and, as far as possible, were saving coal at thepresent time. Instructions to &quot;coalup&quot; had been given and our supplies were being increased.The Prime Minister added that he would be glad if theIndustrial Unrest Committee would devote their immediate attentionto the following subjects in connection with the possible coal strike : The conservation of the coal supply and the possibility of usingfuel other than coal ;The protection of the various centres where coal, food, and petrolsupplies would be concentrated ;The extent to which electric trains and motor transport couldbe used for the distribution of food supplies ;The protection of herds of cattle in the open country ;The use of the navy ;The use of the G. H. Volunteers.
Effect of Seditious 5. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that sailors were nowSpeeches on Naval obtaining twenty-eight days&apos; leave. During the war these men hadMen on leave. jjad practically no leave at all.   Although the discipline of the navywas magnificent, his naval advisers were a little anxious as to theeffect of seditious speeches on these men during their leave, and hewould therefore strongly urge that the makers of these speeches shouldbe prosecuted with tlie utmost vigour.The Home Secretary stated that, in accordance with the decisioncome to by the War Cabinet, (War Cabinet 529, Minute 7), steps inthe direction indicated by the First Lord were being taken,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.

APPENDIX.My ,Lokps and Gentlemen,THE dissolution of the last Parliament followed almost immediately upon the collapse of Germany under the ceaseless blows of the Allied Armies. Since that date the terms of the Armistice, which have been more than once renewed, have beenperseverinffly enforced&apos;. The enemy forces have retired behind the Rhine, and havesurrendered much of their armament. The Allied Armies have occupied the bridge-heads across that river, thus laying open the road into Germany should she attempt,to renew the war. During the same period the might of the German Navy has beenshattered by the surrender of the enemy&apos;s submarines and the internment of his mainfleet in My ports.These great results, which give practical securities that the struggle betweenGerman tyranny and European freedom is at, an end, and that a new era hasdawned, have been achieved by the vigilance and disciplined efficiency of the Britishand Allied Fleets, and by the courage, the endurance, and the determination of MyArmies and&apos; the Annies of the many Nations fighting with them. Among theresolutions to be submitted to you will be one asking you to give solemn expression tothe gratitude of My People for the achievements and sacrifices of those who have suffered for the Country&apos;s cause by land, and. sea, and air.In order to reap tire full fruits of victory and to safeguard the peace of theworld an adequate Army must be maintained in the field, and proposals which willbe necessary to secure tin; forces required, will bo submitted to you in due course.For the last, month a Conference of My Plenipotentiaries and of the Repre-sentatives of all the Allied and Associated Powers has been assembled in Paris todeliberate upon the terms of a just and lasting peace. Their discussions have been marked by the utmost cordiality and goodwill and by no disagreement. They havemade good progress with the examination of tin.&apos; numerous and varied problems whichwill require settlement in the Terms of Peace, and 1 trust that before the Session is far advanced Preliminaries of Peace will be signed. I rejoice particularly that thePowers assembled in the Conference have agreed to accept the principle of a Leagueof Nations, for it is by progress along that road that 1 see the only hope of savingmankind from a recurrence of the scourge of war.I took an early opportunity to visit France and to convey to the President of theRepublic the heartfelt enthusiasm with which My People acclaimed the final liberation of her territories and the vindication of the national unity of our faithful friend andally. I was deeply moved by the demonstration of cordial affection which I received during My visit.It has also given Me great pleasure to receive in this country the President of theUnited States of America. The enthusiastic welcome accorded him is a proof ofthe goodwill which all sections of My People feel towards the great Republic of theWest, and an earnest of the increasing understanding with which I trust they will act together in the future.For the last few months the Imperial War Cabinet has been in continuoussession, and My counsels in regard to the War and external affairs have been bothstrengthened and enlightened by the presence of the leading Ministers of Myself-governing Dominions, and of representatives of My Indian Empire. Theinspiring sacrifice and the invaluable service which have been rendered by the peoples of the Dominions and of India during the War have won for them animportant place in the counsels of the world, and it has been a source of especialsatisfaction to Me that their title to representation has been fully recognised in the paris conference.I trust that the Reports of the Committees which are now enquiring intomatters connected with Indian Constitutional Reform will be received in time toenable a Bill on the subject to be presented in the course of the Session.
The position in Ireland causes Me great anxiety, but I earnestly hope that conditions may soon sufficiently improve to make it possible to provide a durablesettlement of this difficult problem.Gentlemen oe the House of Commons,You will be asked to make further provision for meeting the permanentcharges resulting from the War, and the new expenditure required for purposes of reconstruction.My Lords and Gentlemen,The aspirations for a better social order which have been quickened in the heartsof My People by the experience of the. War must be encouraged by prompt and comprehensive action. Before the War, poverty, unemployment, inadecpiatehousing, and many remediable ills existed in our land, and these ills were aggravated by disunion. But since the outbreak of War every party and every class have workedand fought together for a great ideal. In the pursuit of this common aim they haveshown a spirit of unity and self-sacrifice which has exalted the nation and has enabledit to play its full part in the winning of victory. The ravages of War and the wastage of War have not yet, however, been repaired. If we are to repair these losses and to build a better Britain, we must continue to manifest the same spirit. We muststop at no sacrifice of interest or prejudice to stamp out unmerited poverty, to diminish unemployment and mitigate its sufferings, to provide decent homes, toimprove the nation&apos;s health, and to raise the standard of well-being throughout tbecommunity. We shall not achieve this end by undue tenderness towards acknowledgedabuses, and it must necessarily be retarded by violence or even by disturbance. Weshall succeed only by patient and untiring resolution in carrying through thelegislation and the administrative action which are required. It is that resoluteaction which I now ask you to support.A large number of measures affecting the social and economic well-being of thenation await your consideration, and it is of the utmost importance that theirprovisions should be examined and, if possible, agreed upon and carried into effectwith all expedition. With this object in view, My Government will invite theconsideration of the House of Commons to certain proposals for the simplificationof the procedure of that House which, it is hoped, will enable delays to be avoided and give its Members an increasing opportunity of taking an effective partin the work of: legislation. You will be asked to approve a Bill for the creation ofa new Ministry to deal with public health, with a view to the establishmentthroughout the land of a scientific and enlightened health organisation to combatdisease and to conserve the vigour of the race ; also a Bill to establish a Ministry of Ways and. Communications with a view to increasing and developing theindustrial and agricultural resources of the country by improved moans of transport.You will be asked to consider measures for effecting a speedy increase on a large scale in the housing accommodation of the country, for the fulfilment of the pledges givento Trade Unions, for the prevention of unfair competition by the sale of imported goods below their selling price in their country of origin, and for increasing industrial and agricultural output, without which a considerable and permanent betterment in thenational condition cannot be effected. Proposals will also be laid before you for encouraging settlement on the land, particularly by those who have been in the fighting forces of the Crown, for providing suitable men with the necessary agriculturaltraining and for enabling them to stock and equip their holdings, and for the reclamationof land and the promotion of a comprehensive scheme of afforestation.Finally, I commend to your earnest consideration the industrial problemsof the time. That the gifts of leisure and prosperity may be more generally sharedthroughout the community is My ardent desire. It is j^our duty, while firmlymaintaining security for property and person, to spare no effort in healing the causes of the existing unrest, and I earnestly appeal to you to do all that in you lies to revive-and foster a happier and more harmonious spirit in our national industrial life.I pray the Almighty God may vouchsafe His Blessing on your Labours.o
