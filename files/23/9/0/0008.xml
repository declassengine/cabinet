Demobilisation.Armies of Occupa-tipn, Overseas and home Garrisons.1. THE War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War, covering the Report of a Committeehe had appointed to consider the immediate provision of the armies of occupation required in the several theatres of warand of the home and overseas garrisons, and appending a letterreceived from Sir Auckland &quot;Geddes (G.T.-6874, Appendix),and also a Note (G.T.-6709) by the President of the LocalGovernment Board on the above Memorandum.The Secretary of State for War said that his own Memo-randum, together with the Report of the Adjutant-General&apos;sCommittee,, which had been circulated to the Cabinet, represented the considered views of-his Department. He had just returned from France where he had submitted the proposals contained inthe Report to the Prime Minister, and these proposals had Beendiscussed at one or two conferences at which the Prime Minister,the C.I.G.S., and he himself had been present, and some of whichhad been attended by Sir Eric Geddes. The result of these con-ferences was embodied in a Note to which he proposed to referlater. He would now merely say that the Prime Minister had suggested no substantial modifications of the War Office proposals,the principle underlying which remained unchanged. What theWar Office &quot;required was 1,200,000 men during 1919, whose services would have to be retained under compulsion, for the follow-ing purposes: (a) to occupy the Rhine bridgeheads allotted tous, and (6) to tide over the period until we could raise a voluntaryarmy of sufficient size to meet our requirements. The positionto-day was that, apart from the old &quot; Regulars,&quot; we had men oftwo categories, (i) those who had undertaken to serve for the duration of the war, and (ii) those whose services could be retained for a period of six months after the cessation of hostilities. At acertain moment, which might come unexpectedly, we mightsimultaneously be deprived of our military forces all over theworld, France, India, Egypt, Palestine, &amp;c, as well as those re-quired for purposes of home defence and to support the civil power in case of need. In this uncertain interval it would beimpossible for us to create a voluntary force of sufficient size.So far, only 13,000 men had volunteered for further militaryservice. We needed at home 250,000 men, which number might bo,divided as follows: 45,000 in Ireland (instead of 110,000 as main-tained at present), 30,000 in England as a reinforcement for theIrish garrisons, 35,000 to maintain order at home (which was a smaller number than we had hitherto regarded it necessary tokeep up), 10,000 for coastal artillery and anti-aircraft purposes,17,000 in Dispersal Stations, 16,000 in Pay Offices, 3,000 inRecord Offices, 10,000 to look after horses, and 10,000 to look after Mechanical Transport, 20,000 for draft-finding units, and28,000 to guard enemy prisoners. As regards the Army oni the rhine, the^ Prime Minister had agreed to our reducing the numberof our divisions for this purpose from 15 to 10, and had instructedField-Marshal Haig to- secure Marshal Foch&apos;s approval of this reduction. The French were maintaining no less than 50divisions, and the Americans would certainly have more than 10divisions in France. We were, therefore, in comparison withthese two co-belligerents, doing rather- less than our share.Mr. Churchill pointed out that the actual army to be maintainedoverseas and at home was a matter for the decision of the Govern-ment; it was for his Department to provide the men.which theGovernment decided were necessary. In any case, however, oom-pulsion would be necessary to bridge the gap between the presenttime and the period when a voluntary army .of sufficient sizewould be forthcoming. If the Government decided on a drastic reduction of our armies in Europe, we could not undertake our share of the garrisoning of the Rhine bridgeheads, and we wouldbe failing in our obligations to our Allies. The scheme; he putforward was, he maintained, elastic and adapted to meet what-ever policy the Government,might approve.
Mr. Bonar Law said that the main thing the Cabinet hadto decide that afternoon was the nature of the proclamation inwhich, the Governments&apos;s policy should be announced to the nation.The essence of their discussion was to arrive at the actual numberswinch were required at the moment.The Secretary of State for War, resuming, said that 280,000men were wanted in France for salvage purposes, in order tosalve property, the value of which amounted to many hundreds of million pounds. This salvage work could, of course&apos;, be handedover to civilians, but only at enormous loss. Many of the salvagemen might be found from the Demobilizables, who would be glad to continue to serve at higher rates of pay. He estimated thatwe should need 200,000 men to hold the Rhine, 50,000 on the Linesof Communications, 280,000 (which might possibly be reducedto 120,000) for salvage work. If the reductions in regard tosalvage men were found feasible, the total required for&apos;france would be 370,000. For the Middle East we should want 100,000European soldiers and 250.000 native soldiers. The Europeansoldiers were estimated at the low number of 100,000. because thePrime Minister had represented that he hoped to be able con-siderably to reduce our commitments in those regions. The saidregions comprised the whole of the Middle East, where our troops were at present, excepting India, and involved the evacuation ofthe Dnbrudja and the Caucasus, and reducing our present garrison in Syria. We had. in Siberia and North Russia, some 14.000 men.He would here remark that the situation of our troops in russia was most unsatisfactory. Owing to our having an unsettledpolicy, it had not been possible to send out a sufficient supply of medical services or enough railway men. &amp;c in order to enableour troops to held their own with confidence against the Bolshevikarmies, which wore growing in efficiency and audacity.As regards India, the garrison of 06,000 white troopswas being reduced by 20.000. and in this connection he would invite the attention of the Cabinet to the fact that the white troops now in India were the old Territorial Units, whom we werepledged to return to England on the cessation of hostilities, andit would now be necessary to keep them in India at least untilthe following- winter.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that although on the onehand it might be contended that our Territorials in India had.at least escaped all active service and had saved their skin, to useMr. Bonar Law&apos;s phrase, on the other, many of them had died or were broken in health, or had not been on leave for over fouryears. Moreover, many of them were drawn from one area. i.e\,whole battalions from one district, which meant that the districtin question naturally did not understand why their men did not come home.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he believed that most of the Territorials now in India had at one time or anotherseiwed in Mesopotamia.The Secretary of State for War, resuming, said we had further about 10,000 men garrisoning Malta and Gibraltar, &amp;e.If the troops from the latter place were withdrawn, there would-be nothing to prevent the Spaniards from marching in and occupy-ing it as soon as Peace was signed. Briefly, his proposal amountedto this: 800,000 men should be retained and 2,700.000 shouldbe released. Put in another way, it was proposed that threeout of every four men should be released according to TradeCategories &quot; outside the net,&quot; the remainder being kept on in military service at higher rates of pay.Tlie Adjutant-General said that the War Office proposals also included the demobilization of every man over 39 years of ageenlisted since the 1st January, 1916.Sir Eric Geddes said that there was a conflict between twoprinciples.    The  Government had adopted  the  principle of
demobilization by industrial selection. If they proceeded on those lines there would eventually be no army at all. Therefore, heSuggested that a line should be drawn round certain ages, that is,of men enlisted after a certain date; any surplus in the net theSecretary of State of War might decline to demobilize by in-dustrial selection; but if the old Army were to be demobilized bythis latter process it was undesirable to throw the net too wide. Asregards the Adjutant-GeneraTs statement that everybody over39 should, be demobilized, he thought it was decided in Paristhat the age should be 36.The Secretary of State for War said that he understood that39 had been the age agreed upon by the Adjutant-General andSir Stephenson Kent.The Adjutant-General said that there were two- alternatives:(a) to fix the age high and get in more combatants than we re-quire, and (b) to fix the age low and discriminate between theadministrative and the combatant services. He himself thoughtmuch the best policy would be to have one rule for the whole Army.There was already considerable unrest among the administrative services.Mr. Bonar Law said that a big principle was involved. Ifwe retained in the net twice the number of men we require weshould be up against public opinion, and there would be a con-siderable loss of labour for industrial purposes. As regards the adjutant-Generahs point, he thought there need be no discrimina-tion in reality so long as an equal proportion of combatant andadministrative services were released.Sir Eric Geddes said that it was proposed so to throw the netas to get more men than we require. Tbe A.S.C. on the lines ofcommunication contained a large proportion of the elder men. Inthe combatant services there were many older men who werepivotal N.C.O.&apos;*s and who must be retained. He himself there-fore did not see why it should be necessary to discriminate againstthe A.S.C. It had been suggested that Tribunals composed ofCivil and Military Representatives should decide whether cer-tain men should be released because they were fathers of families or had a certain number of wound stripes, &amp;c.The Secretary of State for War suggested that the cabinet might decide that the War Office net should be so adjusted as not to&apos; catch more than 1,200,000 men, and that he should thendiscuss the details with Sir Eric Geddes. It had been proposedthat 800,000 men should be retained out of the classes which nowheld 1,500,000, and that the surplus should be gradually released by ages. He was,- however, willing to try to reduce the 1,500,000to 1,200,000, and to secure the 800,000 from the latter number.They were now releasing 35,000 men a day, and it was a matterof urgency to settle the size of the Armies of Occupation at once.In regard to legislation, he did not propose in the draft whichhe submitted to&apos; Mr. Bonar Law just before the meeting to go beyond &quot; the consent of Parliament, where necessary, would beasked for at the earliest possible moment.&quot; This would commit the Government to nothing absolutely definite. In reply to aquestion he said that this would apply to the current year. what he asked was to be allowed to retain not less than 800,000 men, on condition that they would be released by categories a,s mightbe found feasible, and to raise a Volunteer Army. He contem-plated that when the Army Annual Act next came up for Parlia-ment, assurances should be given that the men retained shouldbe released as soon as possible, and to ask for power to form a voluntary Army, which would allow the compulsory quotagradually to be diminished.(Mr. Churchill then read out notes of the Conferences heldin Paris, at the end of which he stated that, should thedemobilization of the German Army be carried out in a thorough and satisfactory manner, the Prime Minister might wish to reduce our Army on the Rhine below 10 divisions.)
WG 521Mr. Bonar Law said that he did not think it necessary togive the public precise figures. Public opinion would notworry about figures, but it was very much concerned about the conscript Army. In the circumstances, therefore, itwas not essential to cut the figures too fine. In their Electionspeeches practically all the Members of the Government hadpledged themselves to no conscription after the war. He was apprehensive as to what would be the effect on the public mind if the Government&apos;.? first Act in Parliament were to passa Conscription Bill. It might be possible to explain the circum-stances and carry the Bill, but a formidable opposition would beroused in the country. He suggested that it should be announcedthat the arrangements considered necessary by the Governmentwere subject to a statutory date, until which date no new com-pulsory Service Act should be introduced. The Army council were now trying to get volunteers for a post-war Army; it waspossible that when discharged soldiers came home and found no work waiting for them they would be disposed to volunteer again for military service. On the other hand, this factor of possibleunemployment of discharged men might dangerously affect thelabour situation.The Secretary of State for War said that in his opinion theCabinet ought to meet the situation in a frank and courageousmanner; any vacillation would have an unfortunate reaction uponthe Peace Conference in Paris. It was essential that we shouldhave an Army to bridge the gap until a voluntary force could beraised.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the Government should announce that, in order to obtain the fruits of victory, it wasnecessary to keep an Army in the field; and that until we knew what the Peace Conference was going to decide, it was impossiblefor us definitely to fix the size of our Army.The Secretary of State for War maintained that this coursewould lose the moral advantage of having a definite policy, and ministers would meet Parliament nursing, as it were, a guiltysecret. He strongly advocated the Government taking a frankand bold line. If their opponents saw that they were too timidto take a strong line there would be endless trouble.Sir Eric Geddes said that he agreed with Mr. Churchilbssuggestion. He himself thought it was essential to kill the hopeof the men who were expecting to get out of the a.rmy at once.The present uncertainty was responsible for most of the existingdiscontent and unrest. So long as the men at the front relied onthe hope of getting back shortly to England they would moveheaven and earth to obtain their discharge.Mr. Bonar Law contended that his plan would not leave thisuncertainty. The -Government would state that their arrange-ments must hold ^good for five or six months until peace was signed, when w:e should know exactly where we stood.The First Lord of ;the Admiralty said he also strongly sup-ported Mr. Churchill. He foresaw no trouble if Parliament werefrankly told iexactly what -the situation was. As regards the alleged pledges in respect of no compulsion, he had attendedseveral meetings during the Election, and the question which hadbeen put,to candidates was, &quot;Are you committed to compulsory service in the future1?&quot; The answer given was &quot; No, but untilpeace is ssigned we must maintain our armies at the front.&quot;Moreover, the Prime Minister himself had said that so long as foreign Governments maintained conscription Great Britain mustkeep up her army.The -president, of the Local Government Board said he raisedtwo points. The first was ;that it was stated that we needed a statutory legislation .to (maintain -compulsion until the end of thewar ;^and second, that recruiting under the Military Service Act
was to be reopened.   These involved two different things, namely-(a.) Compulsion.(b.) Recruiting machinery.He agreed with Mr. Churchill that the men at the front wouldnot object to remaining there in order to enable the nation to reapthe fruits of victory, but to restart machinery for compulsoryenlistment at home was quite another matter and he was opposedto it. We ought to try to get what extra men we want by voluntarymeans.The Secretary of State for War said that he was glad that dr. Addi&amp;bn had raised this point. He was not asking for com-pulsory powers to enlist young men; that might be necessary asmonths go by should Europe fail to settle down. He did want,however, to be empowered to tell the: country that, broadly speaking,we were releasing three-quarters of the &quot;army to return to civil life.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that theright policy was to take the fence boldly. The present uncertainty and timidity on the part of the Government will merely result inthe boiling up of public opinion. He thought that they had agood case, but whether the country would accept their proposalsor not would largely depend on how the case was presented andon the number of men required. There was, for example, a greatpsychological difference between asking for under and asking for over a million. His own Department was, of course, greatly con-cerned in the decision which might be reached by the Cabinet.The original proposal to grant a bonus to 1,200,000 men was esti-mated to cost  36,000,000 This amount would be substantially reduced if the size of the army were limited to 800,000 men.The President of the Local Government Board said that if itwere not proposed at once to reintroduce compulsory enlistmenthe would not oppose the present suggestion. Pie did not anticipate any great difficulty in retaining an army of 800,000. He under-stood that the proposal to retain these men compulsorily would bofor a limited period only.The Secretary of State for War said that the proposal would operate like the Army Annual Act, thjat is to say, that new legis-lation would be introduced as circumstances required. As time went on and the voluntary system was re-established, they wouldbe able to reduce the total held back compulsorily.Mr. Bonar Law hoped that in the pronouncement to be madeby the Secretary of State for War we would not be committed tothe definite figure of 800,000.The President of the Local Government Board said that hethought it was most important in the pronouncement to make itabsolutely clear why compulsory retention was necessary.The Secretary of State for War said that he had consultedMr. J. H. Thomas, now in France, and had told him that it wouldbe necessary compulscrily to retain some eight or nine hundred thousand men, and that Mr. Thomas had not been seriously dis-disturbed at the prospect. As regards the actual number of men tobe retained be hoped it would not be limited to 800,000, as hethought it desirable that they should have an additional 100,000men up their sleeves.The President of the Local Government Board said that he understood that the men outside the net would be demobilized onan industrial basis.Sir Eric Geddes suggested that the men should be told that ascertain ages were reached in the process of demobilization theywould be placed in the deraobilizable army, and they would be senthome according to industrial groups.The Minister of Labour suggested that the Secretary of Statefor War, in his announcement, should also state that all pivotal
men would be released, as asked for, up to the end of this month.The trouble his Department had to contend with was that theycould not dispose sufficiently rapidly of the general mass of de-i/iobibzed men, as these could not be absorbed until the pivotalmen were released.Sir Eric Geddes thought that although the present labour situation in regard to employment was bad, it showed distinctsigns of improvement.The Minister of Labour pointed out that this improvementwas only apparent and not real, as returned soldiers did not at-present appear on the unemployment lists prepared by his Depart-monr. He desired again to press the necessity of releasing pivotalmen with the least possible delay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that from a financialpoint of view any delay in demobilization was a serious matter.The decision of the Cabinet that morning to grant a bonus to de-mobilizabJe men had included the grant of half the said bonus tomen who would not be demobilizable by a certain time.The Minister of Labour said that in raising the new army allpivotal men must be excluded from enlistment or retention.Mr. Bonar Law said that everything depended upon the natureof the announcement to be made by the Secretary of State for War.He himself was inclined to think that the statement in its draftform should first be submitted to the Cabinet before it was issued to the Press.The Secretary of State for War expressed the hope that theCabinet would give him a free hand in interpreting the views ofMinisters. Much delay would be involved if his announcement was to be debated line by line by the Cabinet.Mr. Bonar Law said that he must ask to see the announce-ment before it was published. He would, therefore, request theSecretary of State for War to send him a copy in sufficient timeCor him to assemble Ministers to discuss doubtful points if neces-sary before it was issued to the Press.Sir Eric Geddes said that among the many difficulties theywould have to face would be the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal inregard to higher pay to be granted to non-demobilizable men.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said it was to the interestof his Department to keep the net drawn as narrowly as possible.As regards salvage men. he understood that the numbers quoted by the Secretary of State would he rapidly reducible. He himself would prefer that in this class the numbers should be underesti-mated rather than overestimated at the outset.The Secretary of State for War said that the size of the netwas a matter for the decision of the Government.  He understoodthat the Cabinet hoped that it would not exceed 1J million men-Mr. Bonar Law hoped that Tribunals would be used as little as possible,The Secretary of State for War said that it might not bepossible entirely to dispense with them, but they would be requiredto work on certain lines.The. President of the Board of Trade asked how the releaseof miners was proceeding.The Secretary of State for War said that 175,000 had alreadycome home.The President of the Board of Trade pressed for the immediaterelease of the remainder.The Adjutant-General said that he had been informed byGeneral Fowke (the Adjutant-Geneiral of the British Expedi-tionary Force in Prance) that all the coal-miners in that country had already been released. Coal-miners released from theEgyptian Expeditionary Force were now beginning to arrive inEngland.
The War Cabinet decided: (a.) That the Secretary of State for War should re-draft his proposed announcement in the Press in regard to the, future strength of our armies and the necessity for maintaining forces of a certain size in various theatres,in the sense of the above discussion.(&amp;.) That the Secretary of State for War should submit, withthe least possible delay, a copy of the re-draft to Mr.Bonar Law who should, if necessary, assemble a meet-ing of the Cabinet or a conference of Ministers todiscuss and decide any doubtful points.Industrial Unrest. 2. At the request of Mr. Bonar Law, Sir Robert Home out-lined to the Cabinet the present position regarding industrial unrest.Sir Robert Home said that the worst strikes were in the ship-building and enginering trades. These trades were out on thequestion of the 47-hour week. An agreement had previously beenarriAred at between the employers and employees on this matter,but the terms as to who should and should not be included in the shorter week were left very loose. For example, it was not clear whether the piece-worker and the piece-worker &apos;s helper shouldbe included.The Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Tradesmet last week and the men&apos;&quot;s representatives decided to go backto their Unions and recommend a return to work. The men.however, disregarded this advice and the Trade Union leadersturned to the Ministry of Labour for support.In.the meantime the workers on the Clyde arranged to strikefor a 40-hour week, and those in Belfast for a 44-hour week. both these strikes were disavowed by the Union leaders. Communica-tion with Belfast had been difficult, and it was thought that tele -graph and telephone lines were being tampered with. Sir robert home said on the N,E. coast the Unions were granting strike pay,but that it had not yet been discovered whether the shipyardUnions were giving strike pay in Glasgow and Belfast. He hada meeting on the following day with the Negotiating Committee,when he hoped it would be agreed to discontinue strike pay.Sir Robert Home said that the position was rendered ex-extremely difficult as the Government could not actively interfere in the settlement of these strikes over the heads of the Union Execu-tives, and the men had so far totally disregarded the advice oftheir leaders; all that it had been possible for him to do was tokeep in close touch with the situation and give advice. The-workers on the Clyde had telegraphed to him yesterday asking himto go down and negotiate, but he could not deal with these peopleexcept through their Union leaders.Sir Robert Home stated that another strike had broken outyesterday among the Thames ship-repairers. Some time ago theCommittee on Production had allowed them 5s. a week increasewhen they had asked for 11., and they were now striking for the extra 15s. This demand had been put forward to individual employers, and had not been submitted formally by the meu&apos;s(Unions.In his opinion the newspapers were unduly alarmist aboutthe situation. The -present sporadic outburst of discontent wasnot unexpected. He had seen a number of pressmen with a viewto allaying -their apprehensions.In-answer to a question as to what stage he proposed tointerfere, Sir Robert Home said that If by to-morrow the ship-yard position was still at a deadlock, he would feel bound to inter-vene directly.Mr. Chamberlain said unfortunately in recent years therehad been an increasing reliance placed on the Government as the
ultimate arbiter in labour disputes, with the result that strikeswere prolonged by the fact that neither side would say the lastword as to&apos; what they were prepared to concede, as they expected the Government to be called in at any moment.Mr. Munro said that he had talked that morning with certainleading Glasgow citizens, who suggested that what was most re-quired in Glasgow was unofficial propaganda.Mr. Bonar Law agreed with this view and asked the Ministerof Labour if he could give certain facts regarding the situation,such as he had just outlined to the War Cabinet, through thePress.The War Cabinet requested the Minister of Labour to give to the Press, at latest on the following day the full factsregarding the present unrest, laying stress on the un-authorised character of the strikes.(Initialled)A.

APPENDIX.(G.T.-6674.) --I MUST ask the urgent attention of the War Cabinet to the attached Reportthat has been presented to me by a Committee that I appointed under the chairman-ship of Lieut.-Genera,l Sir G. M. W. Maedonogh, the Adjutant-General, to considerthe immediate provision of the British Armies of Occupation required in the severaltheatres of war, and of the home and overseas garrisons.The recommendations of the Committee in the final form in which they are now presented have secured the general agreement of a full and representative conferenceheld by me at the War Office this morning, wdiich included Sir Eric Geddes, sir robert Home, Sir Douglas Haig, Sir William Robertson, and Sir Henry Wilson.This is unquestionably the most pressing of the problems with which the Govern-ment is faced and immediate decisions are vital.I also append a, letter which I have received from Sir Auckland Geddes.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.January 17, 1919.Report op a Committee on Demobilization, Armies of Occupation, and Homeand Overseas Garrisons.The Committee appointed by the Secretary of State to consider the provision or armies of Occupation and Home and Overseas garrisons submits the following re-commendations and remarks: 1. All men enlisted since the 1st January, 1916, should be held to serve subjectto the following exemptions: (i.) Compassionate (personal) cases and men with three or more wound stripes.(ii). Those over 41 years of age, according to date given in their attestationson attaining that age.(Hi.) Demobilizers and pivotal men, other than those whose retention in theArmy is essential for demobilization purposes. The Ministry of labour will forward names of those in the retained classes by 1st February, and agree that the total number of pivotals, whose release shall be demanded,shall not exceed 250,000 for the whole Army. This number will include those whose names have already been sent in, and will apply to all cate-gories of age and enlistment and not merely to the men retained underthe Committee&apos;s proposals.(iv.) Subjects of Allied countries and British subjects resident in the dominions or in foreign countries in the interest of the export trade.The Committee considered the advisability of releasing Group 43 (students and teachers), but decided that as it would be inadvisable to release students withoutreleasing apprentices, and as the latter were not included in any one industrialgroup1, but would have to be sorted out from all, and besides that, as the release of students and apprentices would destroy the graduated and Young Soldiers&apos; Bat-batalions which it is proposed should form the backbone of the Infantry of the army of Occupation in France, they could not recommend their release.2. The Committee estimate that by adopting the date suggested in paragraph1, 1,727,000 men will be made available before any exemptions iare made. they further estimate that approximately the following numbers will be required for the armies of Occupation, overseas and home garrisons, viz.: Home ... ... ... 250,000France ... ... ... 650,000 (exclusive of Chinese).Other theatres and garrisons      ... 250,000Total    .......       1,150,000These numbers are exclusive of those of the post helium Army which mustnecessarily be in process of formation during the time the Armies of Occupationare retained, and will gradually replace some of the above.There may consequently be a margin of about 600,000 men, against which theexemptions, possibly 300,000 men, will be debited.
3. The Committee are of opinion that the figures before them are so approximatethat it would not be safe to work to a narrower margin to commence with, but theyanticipate that, once the sorting out process has begun, it may be possible to dispense with further categories. Should this be the case, they would propose releasing in turn the higher age categories, i.e., first the men of 40, then those of 39,-and so on.They arc, however, met with the difficulty that a high percentage of the adminis-trative and transportation, services consist of men of these higher age categories,and that, though it may be found possible to replace these men by civilians to aconsiderable extent in Great Britain, it will not be practicable to do so in the armies of Occupation or in Ireland, or in the overseas garrisons.4. The Committee desire to point out that the retention of the categories men-tioned in paragraph 1 will require legislative sanction beyond the statutory datefixed for the termination of the war, and suggest that legislation should be askedfrom year to year for prolonging the liability to service both of these men and orClass Z Reserves. They further consider that recruiting under the Military service act should be reopened so as to enable reliefs to be carried out.5. The Committee consider that their proposals for the retention of men should form the basis for the retention of officers so far as circumstances will permit. Theseproposals should supply an ample number of the junior ranks, 2nd Lieutenants andLieutenants, but practically none of the senior regimental or higher ranks. Shouldvolunteers of these ranks be insufficient, which is unlikely, the necessary numbersmust be held compulsorily. They feel however, that reasonable financial terms should be offered.6. The Committee consider that a sufficiency of junior non-commissioned officers will be provided automatically by their proposals, and that a sufficiency of thehigher warrant and non-commissioned ranks is likely to be obtained by volunteeringif reasonable financial inducements are granted. Powers should, however, be takento retain temporarily such warrant and non-commissioned officers as may lie wanted.7. The Committee recommended that all men held under their proposals shouldreceive reasonable financial compensation.8. The Committee propose that the 46 Graduated Battalions and 23 YoungSoldiers&apos; Battalions now in the United Kingdom should be sent to France as soonas General Headquarters arc ready to receive them. They further recommend that authority should be given to send boys under 19 years of age to Armies of Occupa-tion or garrisons in Europe.9. The Committee consider that volunteers should be accepted from those menwho are demobilizable under this scheme, and that any such volunteers should beset off against requirements, and consequently will produce a reduction in the upper limit of age for retention.10. The Committee make the following minor recommendations: (a.) From a fixed date, say the 1st February, no leave except on urgent corn-passionate grounds should be given to any men overseas other than thoseexcluded from demobilization.(&amp;.) Leave on as generous a scale as possible should be granted to those whoare held.(c.) The demobilization of any man guilty of acts of insubordination should be postponed.(d.) The demobilization of men who are to be released should be according to priority of industrial groups.11. The Committee consider that the scheme when approved by the WarCabinet should become operative forthwith, so as to prevent the further deimobiliza-tion of the retained classes. They would suggest that a full statement of. the reasonsfor the adoption of this scheme should be made publicly immediately before ordersfor its execution are issued. The representative: of the Ministry of Labour thought,however, that the date of bringing the proposals into operation should be postponedto 1st February. .12. The Committee are of opinion that all men forming part of the armies of Occupation, Home and Overseas garrisons, should be liable to^ general service,except that boys under 20 years of age should not be employed outside Europe.G.

Appendix.My dear Churchill, January 15, 1919.I have been studying the existing machinery for demobilizing the armies andhave formed the opinion that it is based on wrong principles, and that if it is allowedto continue to operate it will produce results deplorable alike in civil life and inthe forces.I strongly urge that a sufficient number of men to form the transitional armyor armies of occupation, with their necessary services, be selected on some perfectlysimple principle, and that the rest be demobilized as rapidly as possible.Many alternative bases of selection of the transitional army will ireadily suggestthemselves to you; for example, all men now under 33 who joined the colours after1st January, 1916 (roughly the date of clear knowledge as to the terms of the firstMilitary Service Act), might be retained and all others be demobilized. Those re-tained should, I think, either receive a bonus or increased pay.The basis of selection decided on must, of course, be one which will allow suffi-cient numbers of men to be retained for strict military needs. At present, I believe,the worst suspicions of the Army as to the vagaries associated with the word&quot; pivotal &quot; have real foundation. We have all heard of the fried fish salesman re-leased as pivotal and of other doubtful cases. I, myself, believe that the country is far more in need of the return to it of a fair sample of its manhood than of anyselective return. It seems to me impossible to begin to get back to normal conditionsuntil the population composition begins to return to the normal. In other words,I am sure that this &quot; pivotal &quot; theory of demobilization is fundamentally unsound.But even if it were sound in theory, which I am sure it is not, the staff required towork it does not exist and cannot, so far as I can see, be created.The Rt. Hon. Winston S. Churchill, M.P.Yours sincerely,A. C, GEDDES.
