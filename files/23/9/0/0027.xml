Land Settlement With reference to War Cabinet 539, Minute 2, the War CabinetBill continued their discussion   on the   Land   Settlement   Draft  Bill(Paper G.T.-6791 a).Lord Ernie said that a point arose with reference to clause 9 asto whether a man should be allowed to acquire the ownership of a.holding. If the land was purchased and equipped by the State whileprices were very high, was he to be allowed to rent it at a reasonablerent, and also, if he so desired, to buy it ?Sir Arthur Boscawen said there was a very strong feeling thatsmall holdings should be provided not only for purposes of renting,but also that opportunities should be given to acquire the ownership.Mr. Macpherson said that there wras some time ago a strong-feeling for tenancy as against ownership, but he thought that thiswas changing.Lord Ernie pointed out that ownership would be optional, butthis clause allowed County Councils to sell at the best possible price.Even if a man bought land, it could not be sold for twenty years forany other purpose than that for which he had bought it. finder theCorn Production Act it had to be properly cidtivated. Even aftertwenty years, so long as any part of the purchase-money remainedunpaid ownership was subject to these conditions. In reply toMr. Bonar Law, Lord Ernie said that only the Board of Agriculturehad been concerned with drafting the Bill. He would suggest,however, that it should be referred to the Committee under theLord Chancellor which was considering the Land Acquisition Bill.(War Cabinet 539, Minute 1).Mr. Bonar Law suggested, with reference to the conditionlimiting the price at which the land should be sold, that thiswould have to be lowered by the amount of the allowance granted by the State to meet the abnormal conditions of the transition period.Lord Ernie pointed out that the actual value of the land andthe State allowance would not be known for seven years.The Prime Minister thought there would be a great deal of criticism if land were bought at a high price, and then, after money-had been spent on it, it was sold later at a loss.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the effect of the Statesubsidy as given under this Bill would be that all loss would beborne by the Exchequer. If local authorities acquired small holdingsat a loss this loss would be met by the State ; if later on the land was sold for industrial purposes the local authorities and not theExchequer would receive the whole of the profit.The First Lord drew attention to the land settlement schemewhich had been suggested for Ireland by Lord Mac Donnell, basedon the lines of an Indian scheme of land settlement. Broadly,the scheme was that the Government undertook to settle on theland men who could not otherwise afford to follow agriculture.The land was acquired by the State, who sold it to tenants ; theState retaining, however, in perpetuity a certain percentage of thepurchase price, so that the tenant was not able to sell ormortgage the land. The State alone would then have power to sell the land.Lord Ernie said that all property in a county should beconsidered as a whole. The period during which the County Councilswould have to pay off loans to the Government was eighty years.It was fair that if the County Council during that period made agood bargain on one piece of land they should be allowed to retain the profit. In considering the land as a whole, the profit on one piece should be taken against tbe potential loss on another-piece.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposalamounted to this, that the State should bear all the losses abovethe economic value of the land for a period of seven years, andthe profits should go to tbe County Councils for ever.   If at the
end of seven years the economic value of a piece of land wasonly half the present value, that loss would be borne by the State ;any profit made afterwards would accrue to the County Councils.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that since the County Councilswould have the land for ever there was just as much chance of theirsustaining a. loss as a gain on that land.The Prime Minister, with reference to a suggestion that land-lords were not allowed to raise rents, said that this only referred tothe fact that the rent could not be put up as a result of improve-ments introduced by a tenant. There was no suggestion that the rent should not be put up as a result of the rise in the value of theland due to social influences. He would like to suggest one impor-tant addition to the Bill, namely, that minerals should not be sold.It was quite conceivable that there might be deposits of minerals inthe land in places like South Wales.Lord Ernie undertook to introduce a clause to this effect intothe Bill.    &apos;Major Astor pointed out that in the Housing Bill it was proposed to authorise local authorities to sell houses to tenants, butonly to lease land.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was desirable totake steps to prevent small holders from subletting the land forpurposes other than cultivation by themselves.The First Lord pointed out that in the South of Ireland tenantswho had ajyplied for and bad been granted land had relet it at ahigher price than that at which it had been originally let to them.Lord Ernie said that the Bill should be read in conjunction withthe existing Small Holdings Act, by which it was enacted that if a holding was bought it was held for twenty years under certain conditions; these conditions also applied if the holding was notbought at once. The chief of these conditions was that holdingsshould not be subdivided, let, or sublet except with the consent ofthe County Councils. They should be cultivated by the owner ortenant respectively only for agricultural purposes, and not more thanone dwelling-house was to be erected on a holding. These provisions-safeguarded the present proposals.The Prime Minister drew attention to clause 25 of the Billwinch provided that grants should be made by the Treasury tolandowners towards the cost of adapting land for small holdings.If this was allowed in the case of landowners, it would be claimedalso for industries. The Federation of British Industries had already made the suggestion that the State should recoup them for anylosses they suffered in restarting industry.Lord Ernie said that if this clause was carried it would placelandowners in the same position regarding recoupment of losses onsmall holdings as in the case of losses incurred on account of thewar. If clause 25 was not admitted, the whole of Part-V of theDraft Bill would have to go with it. At present the landownerswould have to pay 5 per cent, interest and 2 per cent, sinking-fund for forty years. Small holdings could hot be started on those terms.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said &quot;that if it were worthwhile retaining clause 25 at all it was worth while giving the land-lord the same facilities which the local authorities possessed. Thepresent principle was to give County Councils the whole of the excess costs, and to give landlords 80 per cent, of these. If we wished to put men on the land and wished to obtain the help of the landlords to do so at present prices some such help as was providedby this clause would be necessary.The First Lord said that there was very little land in thiscountry, except that which was being reclaimed, which was not already profitably employed. If they took an individual case of a landlord who assigned 200 acres for small holdings this would have[826-298] B 2
to be broken up into holdings of say 20 acres each. Then on each of these holdings buildings would have to be put up. Theonly way to meet these costs was to put up the rent of the holdings,and this would cause a great outcry on account of its being so much higher than had been originally paid for die 200 acres, and the contrast with the light costs of the State subsidized holdings. The proposal-to give help to the landlord was the cheapest and the quickest wayof obtaining small holdings. Lord Ernle&apos;s appeal to landownerswould be well responded to if they were informed that the state was prepared to help them.Mr. Bonar Law said that something of.this kind would have tobe done if they wanted the landlords to help at all.The Prime Minister pointed out that they would certainly beprepared to help if the State guaranteed to make up any loss. That,however, was no inducement to economy on the part of the landlord.Mr. Barnes pointed out that a landlord would have a claim toincrease the rent as the economic value of the land went up. Hethought the present proposal would have the effect of helping the landlords twice over.The Prime Minister said that the most urgent problem was thequestion of housing. isle private builder could build houses at a rate which would repay him for his outlay. Now the State were proposing to build, and the builders would say that the competition of the State was spoiling their chances, since in three or four years&quot;time they themselves might be able to build at a profit. If the)&apos;&apos;were to build now they would demand that the State should make up any losses they incurred, as this clause proposed to do in the caseof the landowners.Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that Part V covered the caseof cottages with half an acre of land. This would mean providing asubsid3r for a private builder. He thought it was a very dangerousprinciple.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the case of groupedcottages, which could be built by County Councils, and would not be tied. On the same estate there must be cottages which had to benear the work of the tenants, and these would be tied cottages. Howcould local authorities build tied cottages for the landowner ?The Prime Minister said that he did not think tied cottageswere an absolute necessity. In France houses in the country were built on the system of grouping them in villages there were fewisolated cottages in the countryside and from the&apos;point of view of inducing people to live on the land that was infinitely the best method. Further, the hours of labour in this countiy were comingdown, and there were not the same reasons for having cottages builtnear one&apos;s work as there were before.The President of the Board of Education asked what was thedemand for small holdings amongst the soldiers.Lord Ernie said that a commissioner had been sent out to^France who had explained to the men in one Army Corps thepresent proposals. A few days later their votes had been taken, andthe result was that for holdings up to twenty acres the demand wasvery small; but 75 per cent, of the men had declared for a holdingwith an acre or half-an-acre of land attached. They all appeared torealise that a small holding was a very doubtful method of supportingoneself.   They regarded it as a very good crutch, but a very bad leg.Mr. Munro said that the feeling in Scotland was rather different.There the demand for small holdings was very strong. He hopedthat the Bill would be introduced as soon as possible. He had hada great many threats, particularly with regard to the west coast ofScotland, that if land were not provided for soldiers when theyreturned they would seize it forcibly. The introduction of this bill would be the best possible way of preventing the present unrest inthe industrial world from spreading to the agricultural world.   With
regard to clause 25, it would be interpreted in Scotland as givingpreferential treatment to landlords.The Prime Minister said he would prefer to delete clause 25from the Draft Bill, so that the Government might ascertain whatthe feeling was when the Bill came up before Committee.The Prime Minister drew attention to clause 12 of tbe DraftBill. He thought that it was not altogether wise to omit parklandsfrom the scope of the Bill. Foreigners had often been impressed with the extent of uncultivated land in this country. We hadcompulsory cultivation during the war in some of the parks. Therewere counties where good land was scarce, and where large areas ofthe best land were fenced off as private parks. It was indefensiblethat the State should not be allowed to take portions of such areas.The State had power to acquire it under the Defence of the realm Act.Lord Ernie said that we were prohibited from taking this undej*the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908, which enacted thatno land should be acquired compulsorily, such as parkland, if itwere required for the amenity of a dwelling-house.The First Lord said that if the power to acquire parkland were granted the County Councils would have a powerful weapon whichwould enable them to injure local landlords.Lord Ernie pointed out that this w-as guarded against in clause 8 (1), which requires tbe consent of the Board of agriculture to acquisition try the County Councils.The Prime Minister said that this right of appeal would protecta landowner against a spiteful local authority. It was not right thatall parkland or land belonging to a home farm in a parish should beexcepted from the scope of tbe clause, while a holding of 50 acreswas not protected. He thought that the protection should not continue to apply to parklands, which could be sufficiently protected by the retention in the principal Act of the qualifying words&quot;required for the amenity of a dwelling-house.&apos;&apos;Lord Ernie said that, if the provision of the Bill were applied toparklands, he doubted if clause 1 could be retained. This was a verydrastic clause, and had been introduced in order to prevent a greatwaste of time in the acquisition of land. It provided that where local authorities had had difficulty in acquiring land, power- was granted to enter compulsorily into possession of the land as thoughthe Board of Agriculture had confirmed the Compulsory Order.The First Lord suggested that the appeal  provided  under&apos;clause 8 (1) should be made to some tribunal other than a Govern-ment Department.The War Cabinet decided-1. To delete clause 25 from the Draft Bill.2. That no minerals should be sold.&apos;   3. Subject to these conditions and&apos; the above discussion to refer the Draft Bill to  the  Committee set up under theLord   Chancellor to consider the Inquisition of land bill (W.C. 539, Minute 1).4. That Mr. G. H. Roberts and Sir Arthur Boscawen should beadded to this Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W. 1,March 3, 1919.
