Equipment for I. The War Cabinet had under consideration (a) a note by theEoumania. General Staff, enclosing a summary of the Report by General Greenly,Chief of the Military Mission in Roumania, on the present militaryand economic situation in that country, strongly recommending that,in order to enable Roumania to defend her frontiers and to resistinternal Bolshevism, we should assist her to create a small well-keptmobile force to act as a reserve to the more or less immobile troopsalong the frontier, and to clothe and feed the remainder of thearmy to such a degree as would put the troops in a state of compara-tive comfort and efficiency ; in order to give effect to the above recommendations it was urged (i) that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould give credit to the Roumanian Government for the purchase ofrailway material up to half a million sterling; (ii) that credit be givenalso for the purchase of certain essential military stores and animals ;(hi) that shipping be placed at the disposal of the British military mission to transfer material and stores to Roumania ; and (6) anote by the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (paper g.T.-7028) enclosing a copy of General Greenly&apos;s Report in full, andrecording Lord Curzon&apos;s opinion that His Majesty&apos; Governmentshould give Roumania some immediate tangible proof that the immense sacrifices she had made in the Allied cause had not beenforgotten, and urging that an attempt be made at once to clothe andequip the Roumanian army and to improve the working of therailways ; and, further, asking that the War Cabinet would sanction the necessary expenditure to carry out the recommendations contained in General Greenly&apos;s Report.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that General Greenlyhad made three requests : first, that measures should be taken forthe relief of the civil population. This was already being done bythe Supreme Economic Council in Paris, the necessary shipping beingprovdded, so far as it could be allotted without detriment to othernot less urgent calls upon it. Secondly, General Greenly urged that   the working of the Roumanian railways should be improved.   Thismatter was also being dealt with by the Supreme Economic Council.As regards General Greenly&apos;s third request, which was, that provision should be made by the British Government for the equip-ment and maintenance of the Roumanian army, Mr. Chamberlainsaid that this was a crucial matter. Apart from questions of policy,he thought it would be impossible to deliver military supplies to roumania in sufficient quantities without invdlving a corresponding-reduction in the relief it would be possible to give the civil population.He did not quite understand why His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe asked to provide the necessary money and credits for these measures of relief, as the Roumanian Government had large resources in this country. In any case, he thought that if it were decided thatwe should endeavour to come to the assistance of Roumania, theburden should be shared by our Allies. He had agreed to find1 2-g- millions sterling to feed European countries other than belgium and Germany, on condition that France and the United States wouldmake an equal contribution, and that Italy would also take a share.In regard to the re-equipping of the Roumanian army, he questioned whether 500 machine-guns and 15,000 old pattern rifles would besufficient for the purpose. In any case, he submitted that to placeRoumania in a state of defence was not a matter for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment alone, but was one which required the decision of theAllied and the Associated Powers and their concerted action.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heearnestly trusted that the Cabinet would decide to carry out therecommendations contained in General Greenly&apos;s Report. Thedanger in Roumania at present was more acute than anywhere else.The internal situation of the country was most insecure, and roumania was the sole outpost remaining to us in the East ofEurope.The Secretary of State for War submitted that there was no
time for delay, and urged that the Cabinet should come to a decisionon the limited points at issue.   Unless speedy steps were taken to goto the relief of Roumania, our ally would become a prey to Bolshevismand would be lost to us.    He himself stood by the General Staff note.If the War Cabinet were of opinion that we had no responsibility inthe matter, well and good : it was not for him to shape our policy,but he could not share that view.    In his opinion, the situation was of the utmost gravity.    On the Black Sea littoral the French hadbeen driven from Kherson and Nicolaiev ; Odessa would soon be inthe front line ;  the Bolshevik armies were pressing right on to theRoumanian frontier ;   Hungary, whom we thought we had crushed,had  according to the latest reports once more assumed a hostileattitude towards the Allied Powers, this time in Bolshevik guise;and   unless   Roumania   was  supported   and   encouraged  it   was more than probable that Roumania  would be assailed both fromHungary and from the Ukraine by arms and propaganda.   He agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it was not possible to treat the   Roumanian   question   apart  from   the  many   other  complexpropositions confronting ourselves and our Allies.     it was to find asolution of these problems that the delegates of the Allies and theUnited States were now assembled in Paris.   They had, however,sat for many weeks.    In the meantime the Bolshevist menace was growing daily  more  formidable.     There  would   be   no   difficulty,Mr.   Churchill   proceeded,   in  providing  the   comparatively   smallquantity of material which his military  advisers suggested shouldbe supplied to Roumania.   A considerable quantity of warlike storeswere now on their way for the use of General Denekin,  and  as general Denekhfs scope had been restricted, he suggested that someof these should be diverted for the use of the Roumanian Govern-ment.     In  reply to a  question as to what the total   cost  of the stores it was proposed to send to Roumania would be, Mr. Churchillsaid that the  total amount   would   be  about 407,OOOZ., of which130,OO0Z. would be for equipment, 60,001&apos;Z. for harness, 50,000/. torsaddlery, and  83,000L for blankets, &amp;c.    In conclusion,  lie urgedthat this small modicum of support to Roumania, if promptly sent,might enable and encourage Roumania to carry on,  whereas neglectmight iead to a collapse and to the loss of a whole nation.    Theseaids were small and not in themselves decisive, but they could be sentpromptly and they could be spared.    He felt that it was only his duty to make these representations to the Cabinet as forcibly as he could,and if it was decided that nothing should be done he desired thathis protest should be noted and recorded in the minutes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, with reference to theproposal that some of the so-called surplus stocks which were intended for General Denekin should be diverted to Roumania, that his department had expected to recover a certain amount of money bythe sale of these stocks. As he had already pointed out, theRoumanian Government had considerable resources in this country,but they would not use them.Mr. Bonar Law said that he thought the question of supportingRoumania had been before the Supreme War Council, and that theproposal had been rejected by the Prime Minister. He then read the following extract from the Minutes of the Third Meeting of theEighteenth Session of the Supreme War Council (paper i.C.-162) :-&quot; Mr. Lloyd George hoped that the Conference would notaccede&apos; to the proposals contained in the statement read byMarshal Foch, as he thought it would merely mean givingsupport to the perpetration of great mischief. The proposal, atbottom, merely meant the setting up of a great army for the eventual invasion of Russia. It would be agreed that roumania had nothing whatever to do with Lemburg, but it was hopedthat, once the Roumanian troops had been brought to that place,[826-410] B 2
they would be available for operations against Russia. He was entirely opposed to any such operations, which could only becarried out at the expense of the Allies. ...&quot;The Secretary of State for the Colonies said he had not actually been present at the meeting of the Supreme War Council referred to,but he thought that the objections felt by the Prime Minister toraising a great army which might be used to invade Russia wouldnot apply to a proposal that a certain amount of assistance should begiven to Roumania in order to enable her to defend her country against Bolshevism, which was a very different matter. He further pointed out that, under present arrangements, Roumania came withinthe French sphere, and that the French were more responsible than ourselves for the support of that country.The Minister of Shipping said that he had&quot; just returned from paris, and was certain that the French would strongly object toour interfering in Roumania, which they regarded as one of their particular spheres.Mr. Bonar Law asked, if it was agreed, that we should divertsome of the warlike stores intended for General Denekin, whetherthis would be the end of our commitments : would it not mean that we should be more extensively involved in the future ?The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that if thisdiversion would help the Roumanians to maintain their own frontier,he thought that we should be justified in i ending further assistancelater on.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should instruct the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff in Paris to represent to thePrime Minister that, in view of the increased danger to roumania owing to the fact that Hungary had thrown in her lot with the Bolsheviks and was again in hostility,the War Cabinet proposed, subject to his approval, toauthorise the diversion to Roumaiua of a certain propor-tion of the warlike stores already in transit or loaded upready to go to the support of General Denekin, but surplus to his reduced requirements.OfficeAccommodationand D emobilis ation:Eeduction ofSpecial War staffs and Evacuation ofEequisitionedBuildings.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he wished torefer to a certain letter which had been circulated to the various government Departments by the First Commissioner of Works,stating that in the latter&apos;s opinion a considerable number of buildings, requisitioned temporarily for the purposes of the War,were being retained unnecessarily Mr. Chamberlain said that hethought the delay in evacuating these buildings might be due tothe slowing down of the process of demobilisation. He enquire whether the Minister of Reconstruction was taking any action in thematter.&apos; The Minister of Reconstruction said that he was doing his best to stimulate the demobilisation of various special war staffs whichhad been created in different Departments owing to the war. Asa matter of fact, the particular question raised by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had not formed part of the instructions given to himby the Prime Minister at a special Conference of Ministers held at.0, Downing Street on the 17th February, 1919, when he had beenasked to conduct an inquiry into the unemployment and state oftrade. That enquiry he had now concluded. As a result of it hehad extinguished a very large number of controls and restrictions oftrade, most of which would cease to operate by the end of the present month. As regards the Chancellors point, he understood that sometime previously a Treasury Committee had been appointed to go intothe matter.
The War Cabinet decided That the Minister of Reconstruction should consider, and in due course report to the Cabinet, the most suitable means to expedite the demobilisation of temporary staffs in Govern-ment Departments and to evacuate requisitioned premises.Application of the whitley Report toGovernmentEstablishments.3. With reference to War Cabinet Minute 534 (15), the WarCabinet had under consideration the report of a Committee on theapplication to the Whitley Report to the Administrative Depart-ment of the Civil Service (Paper G.-238).The Postmaster-General said he concurred in the report and hoped effect would be given to the recommendations immediately.The War Cabinet decided To approve the report, and to request the Minister of labour to take the necessary action to give effect to the recom-mendations contained therein, and call a meeting of those concerned at an early date.Electricity Supply 4. The War Cabinet had under- consideration a draft of theElectricity Supply Bill (G.T.-6926), together with a covering memo-randum by the President of the Board of Trade.Mr. Chamberlain stated that the Treasury desired to raise three points of importance : (1.) There was no estimate provided of the probable cost involvedin the Bill. The loan expenditure might amount to50 millions, and in his view the money -night to beborrowed by the Electricity Board in the same manner as money was borrowed bv the Metropolitan WaterBoard.    It ought not to be a burden on the state.(2.) Provision was made in the Bill that under no circumstances would any profit be made by the Electricity Commis-sioners. He did not think that this was right. TheGovernment ought not to be precluded from makingprofit, and ought to be able to take more than the mereinterest on their money and depreciation.(3.) He had received a copy of a report by Sir William Plenderon the valuation proposals incidental to the transfer of undertakings authorised by the Bill. This report com-mented very severely on the valuation arrangements,and, in his opinion, the)r should be very carefully examined in the light of Sir William Plencler&apos;s observa-tions. He was opposed to the Bill on financial grounds,and objected to the assumption underlying every new scheme put forward that all financial difficulties wouldbe got over if the Treasury would find the money. Theprinciple of the Bill was that electricity undertakingsshould be a State enterprise in the future, and he regarded the financial commitments involved as tooserious to be undertaken at the present time.The President of the Board of Trade said that the proposal wasthat so far as concerned power stations belonging to the municipalitiesthe District Boards should merely take over the loan obligations of themunicipalities. It would therefore not be necessary to raise any money. So far as the private power companies were concernedthere would be an obligation to purchase involving roundly13,O0O,O0OZ.     With regard to raising money for the erection of
Arrival of de Valera inIreland.5. The War Cabinet had. before them the copy of a telegram,dated the 22nd March, received by Mr. Bonar Law from the ChieSecretary for Ireland (G.T.-7019) regarding arrangements made bythe Sinn Eein Executive for the arrival of De Valera in Ireland.The telegram stated that the Irish Government viewed these arrangements as the first overt act in defiance of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Ireland, and that they were of opinion that themeeting and the procession should be proclaimed.Mr. Bonar Law said that Lord French was strongly of opinionthat the proposed action should be taken, and the Prime MinisteragreedThe War Cabinet decided To approve the course recommended by the Viceroy.Use of Warshipsfor the conveyance of Troops.6. With reference to War Cabinet 542, Minute 3, the WarCabinet took note of the memorandum by the Acting Secretary(G.T.-7006), stating that the First Lord of the Admiralty had reported on the 18th March that representatives of the admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping had conferred ; that the admiralty had offered to lend to the Ministry of Shipping a certain numberof His Majesty&apos;s ships, provided that the Ministry of Shipping, couldman and equip them ; and that the Ministry of Shipping were now considering the matter.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 24, 1919.oplant and the&apos;transmission system, if it was proposed to wait untilthe District Boards were set up at least three years must elapse before any work &quot;was undertaken, owing to the fact that theCommissioners had first of all to divide the work among the different areas of supply. So far as could be seen the initial expenditure could hardly exceed 20,000,000?. spread over four years.The War Cabinet requested The President of the Board of Trade and Sir Eric Geddes to&apos;confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order, ifpossible, to arrive at a settlement on the points of the bill which were in dispute, and to refer back to the Cabinetany questions upon which they were unable to arrive at anagreement.
