With reference to War Cabinet 523, Minute 5, Sir albert stanley informed the Cabinet that practically the whole of thefollowing London Electric Railways had come out on strike: Electrical Services on the Brighton Railway.Central London.City and South London.Piccadilly.Hampstead and Highgate.The Metropolitan District Railway was, however, still running.The men had held meetings late last night and passed resolutions infavour of continuing work, leaving their demands to be discussed by their Executive. The drivers, however, did not agree with thisproposal and withdrew from the meeting, and afterwards held afurther meeting amongst themselves, when they decided to come outon strike.The question in dispute was whether the time allowed formeals, which varied from thirty minutes to one hour, should beincluded in the eight hour working day. The agreement arrived atsome time ago between the employers and the men laid down thatthe time allowed for meals should be exclusive of the eialit hours.Sir A. Stanley added that the managers said that the men weredownhearted and not enthusiastic.In answer to a question by Lord Curzon as to why the strike had only broken out in London, and whether it would affect otherelectrical services besides the railways, Sir Albert Stanley said thatthe strike would not affect other electricity works ; the London menwere affected because they had not the same opportunity of taking their meals on the train as the steam-engine drivers.Lord Curzon asked whether if the drivers&apos; demands wereconceded, it would mean pressure by the other electric railways allover the country for a similar concession. Sir Albert Stanley saidthat it might mean more than that. When the eight hour agreement was accepted, the men specifically reserved the question of theinclusion or exclusion of meals in the eight hours for further negotiation when their national programme was being considered.If the drivers&apos; demands in this case were conceded, it would mean that the whole meal time question would be prejudiced.Mr. Bonar Law said that it was important that the press shouldreceive a statement as to the position.The War Cabinet decided:--(a.) That the President of the Board of Trade should prepare,in consultation with Mr. Bonar Law and the Minister ofLabour, a statement on the position for issue to thepress.
Strike Situation in 3. With reference to War Cabinet 523, Minute 1, the SecretaryGlasgow. for Scotland said he had received a letter from the Lord Advocatewith regard to affairs in Glasgow, which was fairly satisfactory.The strike was not yet over, but the disorders were dying down.Strike Situation in 4. With reference to War Cabinet 523, Minute I, the ChiefBelfast. Secretary for Ireland said that he had received a letter from lord french saying that there was little change in the Belfast situation.The railway men had refused  to come out, and, in the opinionof the Commissioner of Police in Belfast, the men would be glad ofan excuse to return to work.ThreatenedEngineers&apos; Strike.5. Sir Robert Home said that a London engineers&apos; strike wasthreatened. A section of the men were having a ballot on thenext day as to whether they should come out or not. This wasbeing done, however, without the approval of the amalgamated society of Engineers&apos; executive, who were taking steps to preventthe issue of strike pay. The men were demanding a 40 hour&apos;week.Sir Robert Home added that a deputation, consisting of Macmanusand a few others, had left Glasgow for -Manchester in order to try and stir up trouble in that city with regard to the 40 hour week.Recognition ofRailway Clerks&apos;Association.6. With reference to War Cabinet 523, Minute 6, Mr. bonar law stated that a Committee, presided over by Sir Albert Stanley,had met on the previous day to consider the demands of theRailway Clerks&apos;&apos; Association, and the discussion had been adjourned until five o&apos;clock that afternoon.Sir Albert Stanley said there were indications that the miners and railwaymen generallv might strike in the course of next week.Pay of the Police. 7- The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary (G.T.-6730), in which he suggested that thereshould be an enquiry by an impartial body into the whole question ofpolice pay, both in London and the rest, of the country, and proposing that the best form for such an enquiry would be a committee consisting mainly, if not entirely, of Members of Parliament.Mr. Shortt said that Sir Nevil Macready attached greatimportance to: attracting a high class and loyal body of policemen ;and the Commissioner of Police doubted whether this was possible under present conditions.Mr. Bonar Law had some doubts as to whether the inclusion ofthe provincial police in the Committee&apos;s terms of reference wouldnot cause very great delay, and he thought that unrest might be caused among the Metropolitan Police if they imagined thesettlement of their claims was being hindered by enlarging thescope of the enquiry.Mr. Shortt thought that it might be quicker to confine theenquiry to the Metropolitan Police, but a second Committee wouldthen have to be set up to deal with the provincial police.(6.) That the following Committee should be set up for pur-poses of consultation during the period of the strike : The President of the Board of Trade.The Home Secretary.The Minister of Labour.A representative of the War Office.
Mr. Munro supported the proposal made by the Home Secretary,and expressed the hope that Scotland would be included in theenquiry.Lord Curzon said there were several sorts of Committees thatmight be appointed to deal with this question (1) a Committee ofthe House of Commons, (2) a Joint Committee of both. Houses,(3) a Royal Commission, and (4) a Committee with Parliamentaryauthority. There was a good deal to be said for the second form,inasmuch as one of the Law Lords might then serve on theCommittee.Sir Nevil Macready, in answer to a question by Mr. Bonar Law,as to whether a general reference to the Committee, which includedan enquiry into the pay of the provincial police, might take too longan investigation to satisf3r the London police, said that the Londonpolice were at this moment fairly content with their pay, and hethought would be patient during a general enquiry. It was truethat the London police were passing heated resolutions, but hethought that this was caused by the extremists who were out to capture the next representative Board, which was to be elected onthe 21st of March. A general enquiry was, in his opinion, essential,especially as he had heard, for example, that the MunicipalAuthorities of Nottingham were going into the question of extrapay for their police that day, and the rnens demands were in some respects higher than the scales which at present were paid in London.These demands, if granted, would cause a good deal of dissatis-faction among the Metropolitan police.The War Cabinet decided : (a.) To appoint a Committee, on which both Houses of Parlia-ment should be represented, to enquire into the questionof the pay of the Metropolitan, Provincial, and Scottishpolice.(b.) That this Committee should make its report to the WarCabinet.(c.) That the Home Secretary should draft the terms of reference for the approval of the War Cabinet, and should alsosubmit suitable names for the Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,February 3, 1919.o
