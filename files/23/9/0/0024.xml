Date of PrimeMinisters Returnto Paris.Policy in Russia.1. The Prime Minister said it had been suggested to him from paris that, if by delaying his return to Paris until Tuesday he wouldbe then able to stay a long time, that would be the best arrange-ment. He thought that course would be best, as by then the labour situation would, he hoped, be clearer.2. The Secretary of State for War suggested that our policy inRussia should be discussed before the return of the Prime Ministerto Paris. The War Office had circulated a paper on the subject(G.T.-No. 6885).The Prime Minister thought it would be of very little use discuss-ing this question here, since France, the United States, Italy, and japan were all concerned. He knew the Cabinet&apos;s views, and hewould press those views at Paris.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said there were one- or two questions in connection with our policy in Russia which he would liketo mention. The first was in connection with our troojis in theCaucasus and at Baku. We went to these places in the first instanceon our own initiative. From Admiralty reports which he had seenit was very doubtful if, from the point of viewr of oil and supplies, our occupation of Baku was likely to lead to any useful results, and hesuggested that it ought to be terminated as soon as possible. Thewhole situation in the Caucasus Avas very mixed. The second point,which he would like to mention was in connection with the support which we proposed to give General DenekhVs army. There was agreat deal to be said for our supporting Oenekin, providing he under-took merely to fight Bolshevism, but he was also attacking Georgia.The proposal made by the C.I.G.S. was to send men to the numberof one or two thousand ; this was rather different to helping with military equipment and stores and a few experts.Lord Curzon said that one of the conditions which we had madewith Denekin was that he was to fight against Bolshevism and not against Georgia and Armenia.The Secretary of State for War said that what he wanted was adefinite policy laid.down as to what our action should be in eachlocality.The Prime Minister said the Cabinet was quite clear as to whatpolicy should be pursued, but the cost was a determining factor, andit was for the War Office to say approximately what each of thealternative policies proposed by the Cabinet might cost. It wasvery important that he should have this, information before returning to Paris,The Secretary of State for War said that every effort was being-made by the War Office to provide this information, and to estimate the cost of the minimum requirements in each ;case.The War Cabinet decided That the War Office should submit, before the return of thePrime Minister to Paris, a paper showing the approximateexpenditure which might be involved by each of thealternative jDolicies suggested by the Cabinet.Reconversion tothe ChristianChurch of theChurch of St. Sofia,3. The Prime Minister said that he had received a letter from theSecretary of State for India asking if therewould be any objection tohis writing a letter deprecating the reconversion of the Church of st. Sofia to a Christian Church. Mr. Montagu wanted to do so inorder to reassure the Mohammedans of India, but in his (the PrimeMinisters) opinion he could not write such a letter, as a member ofthe Government, without committing the Government. Moreover,it was a question on which we could not express an opinion without consulting our Allies.Lord Curzon said that the question was becoming somewhatacute.   Only four or five days ago a meeting was to have been held
Naval, Military, 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum and Air Force Bill.   (G.T.-No.  6884) by the Secretary of State for War, covering thedraft of a Bill dealing with the naval, military, and air force services.The Secretary of State for War explained briefly the contents of the draft Bill. All reference to re mobilisation had been omitted from the draft, and. the C.I.G.S. agreed in this course. Inconsequence, men who are demobilised would disappear altogether,and if a national emergency arose Parliament would have to legislate afresh.Clause 2 of the Bill merely carried on the present arrangementas regards men who had been transferred from one corps to another.Unless this clause were inserted when peace was signed men wouldhave the legal right to be transferred back again to their originalcorps, and considerable chaos might result.Clause 3 of the Bill gave the right, if an emergency arosebefore the 30th April, 1920, to revive the Military Service Acts of1916 and 1918. He did not think that such an emergency was iikelvto arise, but if any form of compulsion had to be prolonged during theyears 1920-21 it would be better to take young men instead ofthose who had already served several years and were weary. If atthe end of this year it was not possible to get sufficient men by voluntary enlistment it would be very inconvenient not to have thepowers which this clause would confer on the Government.The Prime Minister said that the normal machinery on theContinent of conscription might be said to be the ending up of a newclass of recruit every year, and that tbe insertion of clause 3 in theBill would, he thought, be regarded in this country as an attempt tocontinue conscription after peace. He would like to ask how many men it was estimated that the class becoming liable would amount to ?The Minister of Reconstruction said about 360,000. He thought there would be more opposition in the House of Commons to a pro-posal to call up young men than to one to keep on the trained men.The Under-Secretary of State for the Air Ministry said thequestion was very much a political one, and his experiences in theMidlands made him think that the proposal would be not at allpopular, as labour would say that the Government was trying to obtainmen at a low rate of wage.Tbe Prime Minister asked if by the 30th April, 1920, it was not likely that we could dispense with everyone except volunteers and,perhaps, another 200,000 men ? The Labour party would certainlyprefer a volunteer army to any conscripts.The Director of Personal Services said that the boy of eighteenwho would be joining the army would be unlikely to be a tradeunionist, and, when once in the army, was unlikely to acquire theoutlook of a trade unionist.in London, to be attended by the Archbishop of Canterbury, LordBryee, and Lord Crewe, to advocate the reconversion of the mosqueto Christian worship. They had been informed, however, that if sucha proposal were made, it was quite possible that the Turks wouldblow tlie mosque up. As soon, as they realised the position, the abovepromoters of the meeting had asked him if he would take theresponsibilty of stopping the meeting. This he had agreed to do, andwrote a letter from the Foreign Office in that sense. He had justheard that Sir Samuel Hoare proposed to raise the question in theHouse of Commons, but he had asked him to postpone doing so.It was undesirable to authorise publication of any letter on. thesubject at this stage.The War Cabinet decided To instruct the Acting Secretary to inform the Secretary ofState for India that in their view it. was undesirable tosend the proposed letter.
Mr. Bonar Law thought that the proposal to have power tocontinue compulsory service would raise a storm in the House ofCommons, and, in any case, that it was not a very opportune time tomake such a proposal in view or&apos; labour troubles.The Secretary of State for War said that what he was trying todo was to foresee the situation with which we might be faced, and toavoid having to legislate in haste and unprepared at a later date.In answer to a question by the Prime Minister, he said that the size of the army which we woult! have to maintain would depend on thestate of the world, the decisions come to at Paris, and the degree towhich men were ready to volunteer for service.The Prime Minister thought that with the men of 18 years ofage already in the Army and volunteers it ought to be possible tomaintain a sufficiently large army for all proximate purposes withoutany form of compulsion. Our policy was to withdraw all our troops from Russia, except volunteers, and possibly to reduce the army inIndia by 20,000 men. Further, he did not see that it would benecessary after peace to keep an army on the Rhine, since the dis-armament of Germany was certain, and would include not only the handing over of all guns and equipment, but also the machinery for making such warlike stores. It was very desirable not to do,anything now which would intensify the suspicion which, in hisopinion was at the bottom of our labour troubles.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that on grounds ofpure justice there was no real answer to the Secretary of State forWar&apos;s contention that it was fairer to take young men than thosewho had already served for considerable periods. He feared, however,that Mr. churchill&apos;s proposal would now cause considerable agitation in the country. He. suggested that if, later on, it was necessary tohave any such powers as those contemplated, it would be timeenough then to legislate.The War Cabinet decided That clause 3 should be deleted from the Bill.The Naval Clause ^ ^e ^irs^ Lord of the Admiralty said that the naval clausewhich it was proposed to insert in the Bill would give us the powerto remobilise the naval forces in case of emergency. By June nextlie thought that most of the additional men taken on in the Navyduring the war would have been demobilised, and unless we had somepower of increasing the fleet in case of an emergency widespreadanxiety would be felt and questions were sure to be asked.The Prime Minister thought that if the clause, as drafted, wereinserted questions were sure to be asked as to what foreign Power we regarded as our potential enemy.    With its reference to &quot; imminent&quot;; national danger&quot; and &quot;grave emergency,&quot; the proposed clause couldonly, in his opinion, be regarded as providing for a war with theUnited States.The First Lord pointed out that it merely put us in a positionto remobilise it necessary. He had had numerous enquiries alreadyabout the cutting down of the fleet, and he thought that the insertion of the clause might possibly have the opposite effect to&apos; what was suggested, and be received favourably rather thanotherwise by the House of Commons. In answer to a question byMr. Bonar Law, he said that we would have the same number ofmen in the Navy after demobilisation as we had before the war, butthere would be no reserves, as in the case of the Army.The Secretary of State for War thought that the insertion of thenaval clause was a much smaller matter than that of the proposed clausegiving us power to enforce compulsory service in the Army, since mostof the men affected in the Navy were seafaring men who hadvolunteered during the war. The clause merely gave the Admiraltypower to put their hands on them in case of an emergency before theworld settled down.
The Under-Secretary of State for the Air Ministry was of opinionthat the majority in the present House of Commons would say we mustrevert to the voluntary system both for the Army and the Navy. Agreat number of the present Ministers during the recent election had declared that we would go back to the voluntary system as soon aspeace came.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was proposed that theGerman fleet should be destroyed, and once ships were destroyedthey could not be replaced for many years. If we now take powers for remobilising the Navy no one would understand it, and certainpeople were sure to say it was aimed against the United States.He could not conceive any situation which was likely to involve usin another war before the 30th April, 1920.The War Cabinet decided That the naval clause should be omitted from the Bill.Subject to the above omissions, the War Cabinet approved thedraft Bill.Conscientious f    %. The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumObjectors. (G.T.-6873) by the Secretary of State for War, and also a Note bythe Secretary of State for Home Affairs (G.T.-6892), in connectionwith the release from imprisonment of conscientious objectors.The Secretary of State for War said that this question wasurgent, and he would like to be able to give an answer in the Houseof Commons that day on the lines suggested in his Memorandum.At present the situation was an invidious one, as men who hadalready served sentences of hard labour were being given freshsentences, and it looked almost as if we were resorting to persecution.A very strong appeal had been made on behalf of this class ofoffender. The Tribunals had so interpreted the decision of parliament as to set free hundreds of men while others were put in prison.Another point that arose was, that the prisons wet e overcrowded,and the Home Secretary was anxious to have them cleared.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that only two or three dayspreviously he had given an answer in the House on this question tothe effect that the matter was receiving consideration, and that theGovernment was not prepared at the present moment to agree tothe-release of these prisoners. There were strong reasons for not going back on this decisisn so soon after it had been given. In hisopinion the fairest course would be not to let any of these men outuntil demobilisation had progressed further.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the Secretary ofState for Wars proposal really answered the point raised by Mr. bonar law, as what was now- asked was that the men who had served twoyears in prison should be released. He had some doubts about the advisability of giving repeated sentences of hard labour for what was practically the same offence, and he was inclined to say that the men should be released, but that they would not be reacceptecl for any government employment.The Secretary of State for War said only a very small numberof men was affected, and his contention was -that, after completing the sentence of two years&apos; hard labour, the men should be dischargedwith ignominy, or as incorrigible and worthless. In this way all ofthem would be discharged under a year.The Director of Personal Services said that in time of peace theKing&apos;s Eegulations provided for men who are convicted of a disgrace-ful offence being discharged from the service with ignominy, as thepolicy had always been not to ask other men to associate in barrackswith offenders of this description. If this regulation, which has beenin abeyance during the war, were revived as now proposed, theconscientious objectors would be discharged from the army for mis-conduct, whereas if it was decided that this should not be done, they[826]-229 O ,
would have to he excluded from the application of the revised regula-tions. The question of release from prison was, of course, anotherpoint, as, according to the Army Regulations, the men would be discharged from the army after receiving sentence.Lord Curzon asked what would happen to the 700 men whowould be immediately released under the proposal now before theCabinet ? What restriction was it proposed to place on their futureemployment ? If none, he thought that public feeling would be against the proposal.The Director of Personal Services said they would leave prison asfree men, but they would lose everything, such as gratuities, dischargecertificates, &amp;c, and he thought they would find it very difficultto obtain employment.Mr. Bonar Law did not think that anyone could say the con-scieutious objectors v^ere, being badly treated if they were allowedout of prison when peace was signed.The Secretary for Scotland thought that two years&apos; imprison-ment with hard labour was one of the heaviest sentences known to law, and said that it was no longer imposed in Scotland, the limitbeing eighteen months&apos; imprisonment. When he was Lord Advocatehe had known of several cases where men had pleaded for three years&apos;penal servitude instead of two years&apos; hard labour.The Prime Minister asked if anyone doubted as to whether, ifthere was trouble in this country, the majority of those men wouldnot be only too ready to shed the blood of their fellow-countrymen.Most, of the men now concerned, were not of the Quaker class, whoreally conscientiously objected to shed blood, but were revolu-tionaries.Some discussion then ensued as to the proportion of menaffected who belonged to each class of conscientious objector, andthe proportion of Bolsheviks, also as to whether it would be practicable to separate the different classes.The Prime Minister suggested that the Secretary of State for home Affairs should look into the matter and see if some relaxationcould not be granted to those men who had served a sentence oftwo years and over. He thought it was impossible for the leader of the House of Commons to announce that the 700 men wouldbe released so soon after the answer which he had given theother day.The Secretary ot State for Home Affairs said that the questionof giving any relaxation to those offenders who had served over twoyears was a very difficult one. This class of offender was most difficult to deal with, and a great many of them were&apos; blackguards.Force had generally to be used in order to get them to do anything,and any relaxation of discipline would throw a great strain on the prison officials.Lord Curzon suggested that the proper answer in the House ofCommons to any question would be that we were still at war, andas soon as peace was signed we would consider the matter.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that if theconscientious objectors were released we would certainty be asked to treat the Sinn Feiners in the same manner. Some of the Sinn Feinershad been schoolmasters, and had preached sedition in the schools.Mr. Bonar Law thought the proper reply to give to questions would be that the matter would be considered again, but not untildemobilisation bad progressed further.After some further discussion the War Cabinet decided (a.) That the question should be reconsidered when demobilisa-tion had progressed further.(b.) That the Home Secretary should report as to what relaxation-tion, if a,ny, can be given to those prisoners who have carried out sentences of two years and over.
Shipping of Troops 7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumvia the Rhine. by the Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-6859), in which itwas stated that it was essential that British troops from and to theArmy of Occupation should he moved via the Rhine and Rotterdam ;that the Shipping Controller had only two small ships available,capable of accommodating about 1,000 men a week on the return journey only ; and that accommodation was required each week for7,000 men for demobilisation and 7,000 men for leave, in additionto 69 battalions to be sent to Cologne as reinforcements.The Shipping Controller stated that to fulfil the demands ofthe War Office at least a dozen steamers carrying about 500 meneach would be required, each taking the best part of a week insteadof a few hours crossing the channel on the present route. he regarded the proposal to ship to Rotterdam as very serious, andregretted that the Departments generally failed to realise that weare really short of shipping of the passenger type. He had heavy demands for vessels to [take the Australians home and had fallenbehind the programme. Moreover, there were in London about 100steamers lying idle, and 80 on the Welsh coast on account of a, strike of ship repairers, which had been going on since Christmas. Inaddition to troubles about steamers for the Isle of Man service and elsewhere, the workmen on the Clyde for the last four and a-half vearshad been deprived of facilities for getting outings on the river,and unless it were possible to return soon for reconstitutioning someof the small vessels that were taken away from the Clyde he fearedthe prevailing grave labour unrest would be increased in the summer.The steamers involved were principally railway steamers with little or no cargo-carrying capacity.The Secretary of State for War stated that the demand todemobilise the Army as quickly as possible had caused considerablecongestion on the French railways, and the failure of the French towork their railways satisfactorily had introduced a new element ofcomplexity. Not only was he anxious to relieve the men from therigours of the present journey through France, but preparations had actually been made on the understanding that it was the policy ofthe British-Government to open the route to Rotterdam, and all theAllied Powers represented at the Supreme War Council had made representations to the Dutch Government that the opening of thatroute was necessary if an early peace was to be secured.Lord Cnrzon supported the case made by the Secretary of Statefor War. He had every hope that the Dutch Government would meet us in the matter, and after the elaborate negotiations that hadtaken place it Would be fantastic to offer only one steamer, capableof holding only 700 men a day. He was of opinion that the strongest pressure should be used to find the necessary ships.The Shipping Controller said that he had not been informed ofthe negotiations that had been carried on with the French and theDutch for the opening of the Rotterdam route for personnel.The Prime Minister said that&apos; it was a matter of regret that theShipping Controller had not been informed of the negotiations whichhad taken place. The difficulty had been raised by the Frenchthemselves in the first instance. They had been almost face to facewith a political crisis, and charges had been brought against theFrench Government that all the trains had been put at the disposalof British troops, whereas the French themselves were left short offood supplies. In consequence an order had been issued by theFrench Government which had interfered very seriously with ourdemobilisation. The Shipping Controller, unfortunately, bad notbeen consulted, but we had been committed to the new route viaRotterdam by our understanding with the French.The War Cabinet decided that-(1.) In view of our commitments to our Allies, it was important that the necessary shipping should be provided for the conveyance of troops by the Rotterdam-Rhine route.
(2.) The Secretary of State for War or his representative should meet the Shipping Controller and discuss the bestarrangements that could be made.Use of Warships 8. The Shipping Controller desired to draw the attention offor the Conveyance the War Cabinet to the fact that the United States Governmentof Troops. were using warships for the conveyance of troops, and suggested thatthe British Government should do the same. He thought it wasnecessary that the Admiralty should realise more clearly the urgent need for trooping tonnage.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had already askedfor particulars as to what could be clone.   He was awaiting a reportfrom his naval advisers, though he understood that there was very. little accommodation on warships to enable them to take troops inany numbers.The Shipping Controller observed that there were some ships that would take 1,000 to 1,200 men, and suggested that as the americans were using their ships for the purpose, the BritishAdmiralty should be able to do the same.The War Cabinet requested The First Lord of the Admiralty to confer with the &quot;ShippingController on the matter.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 26, 1919.
