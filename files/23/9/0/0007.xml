Pay of the Army, 1.. WITH reference to War Cabinet 519, Minute 2, the War-Navy, and Air Cabinet had before them the following memoranda   relative   to force, increases in the pay of the Navy, Army, and Air Force : Memorandum by the War Office (Paper G.T.-6683).Memorandum by the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-6704).Memorandum by the Air Ministry (Paper G.T.-6705).Report by an Inter-departmental Committee, under thechairmanship of the. Minister of Pensions, which had considered the increases in pay to be given to the three services (Paper G.-232).The War Office and the A ir Ministry in their memorandarecommended that the increase should be given by way of a bonuson the scale of Is. 6d. per day for a private, with corresponding increases for other ranks, and that it should be payable from the1st February to all those who were marked down for retention inthe armies of occupation.The Admiralty agreed to the scale increases suggested by theWar Office, but proposed that it should be made a permanentincrease in pay, and should be payable both to permanent and&quot; hostilities&quot; men in the Royal Navy.The Inter-departmental Committee recommended that the increases in all three services should be made by way of a bonus onthe basis of the scale put forward by the Admiralty, War Office,and Air Force respectively. In addition it was recommended that,these increases should be extended to the Indian Army. Further, itwas proposed that all those men. in the Army and Air Force who,although demobilisable, had not been released by the 30th April, 1919,should receive a bonus based on half the scale applicable to thoseretained for the armies of occupation, this bonus to be payable asfrom the 1st May, 1919, and to be paid with the war gratuity.The Minister of Pensions said that if the Report of the Com-mittee were approved, it meant an enormous charge on the british treasury. His Committee had considered the matter very carefully,and had come to the conclusion that ib could not be avoided. Thereason for the increase was frankly to allay unrest, and the presentunrest would only be increased unless an adequate increase weremade. They had come to the conclusion that the War Officeproposal of Is. 6d. per day for a private was the lowest possibleincrease that could be made. The Admiralty desired the increase to be a permanent one; the War Office and Air Ministry that itshould be made by way of a bonus; but the Committee had agreedto recommend to the War Cabinet the War Office proposal for a,bonus. They had gone carefully into the question of increases to non-commissioned ranks and to officers, and had decided that in any increases made to privates, corresponding increases must also be madeto officers and non-commissioned officers.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty said that the Boardof Admiralty had fallen in with the War Office proposals, particularly as regards the amount of the increases, but the manner in whichthey were received by the navy would depend entirely upon themanner in which . they were announced. All the witnesses beforeAdmiral JerranVs Committee had pressed for an increase of 4s. a day to able-seamen, and the Commander-in-Chief himself had said that2s. &quot;a day was absolutely the minimum which could be granted now.Men who had been on leave from the Grand Fleet since the armisticehad had to return before the time because their furlough pay wasnot sufficient to keep them at home.The Firsit Lord stated that he entirely endorsed the views ofthe Financial Secretary that the way in which the announcement wasworded would be absolutely vital to the success or failure of the- proposals.   If the language used gave the smallest loophole for theadoption by the men of the view that the increase now granted
would be reduced later on, he felt compelled to inform the Cabinetin the most definite way that the Board of Admiralty could not beresponsible for the consequences. The men of the navy had behavedwith splendid loyalty, and had borne very unsatisfactory conditionswithout complaint. There had been and there is to-day notrouble in the navy. There had been no incidents similar to thosewhich unfortunately had occurred elsewhere. But there is undoubtedevidence of a widespread feeling of unrest. This is in great measuredue to the fact that when the men went for their Christmas leave(which unfortunately synchronised with the General Election) they found that the conditions in which their wives and children ormothers were living were greatly inferior to those of the munitionor other civilian worker ; and in some cases they were actuallycompelled to return to thefleet before the expiration of their leave, asthe Financial Secretary had stated, because their means were not sufficient to maintain them without making inroads upon the supplies for their wives and children. They of course knew that AdmiralJerranfs Committee is now sitting, and if they are assured that thepresent increase is only a provisional effort on the part of the Govern-ment to meet the immediate difficulty, he thought that they would besatisfied. He suggested that the Admiralty should prepare a draft announcement, in consultation with the War Office, and that thisshould be submitted to Mr. Bonar Law and to the Chancellor of theExchequer for their approval.Mr. Bonar Law said that the Inter-departmental Committeehad considered the question very carefully, and he thought the WarCabinet should approve the recommendations made in their report.With regard to the proposed press announcement, he suggested thatthe Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Board, and the Ministerof Pensions should consult together in drafting this announcementbefore it was presented to himself and the Chancellor of theExchequer.The First Lord agreed that the draft announcement should besent to the Minister of Pensions, as well as to the other members ofthe Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the representativesof the Treasury on the Inter-departmental Committee were satisfiedthat the recommendations made by the Committee were necessary.He therefore accepted them. With regard to the announcement that was to be made, he pointed out that the problems immediately before the army and navy were totally different. He referred tocertain proposals for the future of the army which the Secretary ofState for War had outlined to him by which the attractiveness ofservice in the army would be enhanced quite apart from any raising of the pay, and he expressed the hope that the announcement whichthe Admiralty proposed to make would not be such as to prejudiceany proposals which the Secretary of State for Wrar might make forthe post-war army, or to give him a less free hand than he desiredin putting these proposals forward.Another point he would like to raise was the present partialexemption of officers from paying income tax. The present proposalsmeant an increase of about 47,000,OOOZ. to the tax-payers&apos; burden.Now the war was over, this temporary exemption might have to end,and officers might have to take their place on an equality with therest of the citizens of the Empire. This was a Budget questionwhich could not be decided now, but he thought it necessrry to uttera note of Warning on the subject.Sir Thomas Holderness, enquired if the Secretary of State forIndia should take action in accordance with the recommendation inparagraph 19 of the report of the Inter-departmental Committee.He said that the Secretary of State proposed to recommend to theGovernment of India that&apos;the British officers in the Indian army should be granted the same rates of increase as British officers inthe British Army.   The increases to British officers in the Indian
Army serving with the armies of occupation would, be chargeable toto the British Treasury, and the increases to British officers serving in India to Indian revenues. With regard fo native troops, it was proposed to suggest to the Government of India that the concession to Indian ranks should be granted in the form of an extension ofthe half-yearly bonus beyond the date at which under existingorders it would cease to be paid. The Secretary of State for Indiaproposed that an announcement that bonus pay would be given toBritish and Indian ranks of the Indian Army would be made simultaneously with the announcement in the British press of the increases to the British Army.Dr. Macnamara, with reference to paragraph 21 of the Reportof the Inter-departmental Committee, said that he thought it wasnot only very difficult, but also inexpedient, to make a detailed com-parison between the sailor&apos;s and soldier&apos;s pa3&apos; and privileges and civilian earnings. Such a statement would not he convincing. Hecertainly thought, however, that in any announcement that wasmade, the fact should be emphasised that a statement of pay alonewas misleading.Mr. Forster enquired if the increases should be granted toconscientious objectors ; those who were in prison were not affected,but there were a number of them in labour battalions who come underthe Boyal Warrant for pay, and these could only be excepted if anannouncement to this effect were made. They had not shared in theprevious increases granted ; very few of them would be demobilisedbefore the time when it was no longer necessary to keep an army ofoccupation.Mr. Bonar Law said that since there was a precedent for refusingincreases to these men, he thought they ought to be excepted from participation in the present increases.The War Cabinet decided : (1.) To approve the recommendations of the Inter-departmentalCommittee with regard to the bonus to be granted tothe JNavy, Army, and Air Force (Paper G.-232).(2.) That simultaneously with the announcement of the increases in pay, statements should be published to the effect thata complete reconsideration of the scale of pay, separation,and other allowances, and of terms of service generally,would be proceeded with as soon as it was possible tosettle the size and nature of the permanent forces likelyto be employed in the future ; and emphasising the factthat statements of pay alone are misleading.(3.) That the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary ofState for W&quot;ar, and Lord Londonderry as representingthe Air Ministry-should prepare drafts of the announce-ments to be made on behalf of the three Services; andthat copies of the draft should be sent to Mr. bonar law, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Ministerof Pensions, as well as to other Departments concerned,for final approval, before being issued by the Board ofAdmiralty, War Office, and the Air Ministry.(4.) That the Secretary of State for India should immediatelytake up with the Government of India the matterof the bonus to the Indian Army ; and that, simul- -taneously with the announcement in the press of thiscountry of the increases granted to the British Army, heshould make such announcement as he thought fitregarding the application of the principle to the indian army.(5.) That the above increases shall not be granted to conscientious objectors.
Sugar-beet culti- 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thevation. President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (G.T.-6707).The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries said they wished to experiment in sugar-beet growing in this country, to seeif it could be made a commercial success, fie exjslained that, apartfrom the question of the experiment being a success or otherwise,sugar-beet growing would have the advantage of providing ruralemployment during a season when work was required, namely, duringthe months of November and December. He explained the proposals set forth in his memorandum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Treasury didi i not dispute the desirability of such an experiment, providedsatisfactory financial terms could be arranged. He was not, he added, satisfied with the terms proposed by Lord Ernie. he considered that the State would be giving too much and getting too little. He drew attention to the proposals which had been receivedby the Development Commission from the Co-operative wholesale society, under which, he considered, far more advantageous terms were offered. He pointed out that the Government would be opento severe criticism if they accepted the proposals made by thePresident of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries if better termscould be obtained.Mr. Bonar Law said he shared the views of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. In the past the Government had held aloof from participation in profit-making enterprises, but he thought the time had come to recognise a new principle, and if there was any chanceof profit, the State ought to benefit.The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat both Sir Daniel Hall and he were agreed that the terms setforth in the memorandum, assuming the experiment were made and-was a success, would admit of modification in favour of the State.They were ready and willing to reconsider them.Mr. bonar Law reminded the Cabinet that they had agreed topreference being given to the Dominions in regard to sugar. It was probable, therefore, though the subject had not been discussed bythe Government, that home production of sugar would have to benefit in the same way.The War Cabinet agreed to the principle of experimenting insugar-beet growing in this country, subject to fair terms for the State being arranged, the terms to be settledbetween the President of the Board of Agriculture andFisheries and the Treasury.(Initialled) A.
