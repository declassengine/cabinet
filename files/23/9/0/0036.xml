Land SettlementBill.Clause 15.Clause .16.1. THE War Cabinet had under consideration a revised draftof the Land Settlement Bill (Paper G.T.-6791 b), amended inaccordance with the decisions of the Committee (Paper G.T.-6989)appointed to consider it by War Cabinet 540, Minute 1 (3).The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat the first question for consideration was whether the credit facilities in clause 15 should be extended to all applicants for smallholdings, or whether they should be confined to ex-service men.The Committee had struck out from the draft Bill the limitation to ex-service men, and made the clause of general application. TheWar Cabinet had decided that the Bill should be extended in its general application to all classes of the community, and it seemed tohim that clause 15 should be similarly extended.Mr. Chamberlain stated that 20,000,000?. had been promisedfor the settlement on the land of ex-service men. The original Bill,as approved by Lord Cave&apos;s Committee, proposed that the landlordshould be paid by annuities. It was represented by the Presidentof the Board of Agriculture that to proceed by way of an annuitywould be too slow a process to provide for the urgent needs of returning soldiers, and an understanding was come to that land forex-soldiers should be acquired compulsorily by purchase, the proposalfor annuities being reserved for the general scheme of Land Settle-ment. In the Bill as now drafted, annuities had been left outaltogether and purchase only was provided for, which meant thatthe finance of the whole of the Land Settlement Scheme must beprovided by a capital sum. The 20,000,000?. for the ex-servicemen was to be charged on the Consolidated Fund and regarded aspart of the War Debt. On the other hand, a general scheme ofLand Settlement ought to be a charge on the Local Loans Fund,and he would have extreme difficulty in finding the money if therewas to be a considerable expenditure for this year. The Presidentof the Board of Agriculture had very properly stated to the Cabinethis objections to a large scheme of Land Settlement at the presentmoment, owing to the difficulty of placing men on the land in a sound economic position, by reason of the high prices caused by thewar. We were bound to place ex-service men on the land at theexpense of the State, but we were under no such obligation in regardto the ordinary population, and he therefore hek] very strongly thatthe 20,000,0001. should be confined to ex-service men, as originally proposed by the Prime Minister and agreed by the Treasury when mr. Bonar Law was Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Bill had come back from the Committee wdth a strongrecommendation that a house with half an acre of land should beregarded as a small holding. If this were adopted, the whole costof providing houses in rural areas would fall upon the State, and allthe capital would have to be borrowed by the State, whereas underthe terms of the  lousing Bill the County Councils were obliged tobear all expense up to a penny rate and would be the borrowers.If they had the opportunity of building houses as part of smallholdings, the entire expense being borne by the State, they wouldcertainly adopt that course rather than exercise their powers underthe Housing Bill.He was already alarmed at the extent of the borrowing whichthe Government had to undertake at the present moment. before any new borrowing was undertaken they must provide for the renewal of repayable debt already incurred. 1,500,000,0001. must be renewed before the end of next year, of which 900,000,000?. were inTreasury Bills which would have to be renewed four times overin the course of the year. The demands of the Dominions were25,000,000?., and of the Allies 100,000,000?. He regarded thefinancial position as one of extreme gravity.The Committee had reversed all the decisions of the Government,and the Treasury had not been represented on it. He suggestedthat the proposal to create small holdings out of a cottage and half an acre of land should be restricted to ex-service men.
The President of the Board of Agriculture observed that ifholdings of any considerable size were provided, it would be verycostly, and owing to the inexperience of the new tenants the holdingswould not be a financial success.    The wishes of the men as shown by the  census of an Army Corps in France  were  in  favour ofcottage holdings as a supplement to agricultural wages, and if thedemand were met in that way it would enormously diminish the more expensive holdings which would otherwise have to be provided, andat the same time it would meet the demand for rural housing, and tothat extent relieve the work to be done under the Housing Bill.The only additional expense would be half an acre of land in each case,which would be a small  item in the housing programme.     he admitted that   a   difficulty   arose   out  of  the   penny  rate,  butthe  CouDty   Council   would   be  the  housing authority for  this class of holding, and   at  the same time the financial authorityto  arrange for   the   money.     On   the  other hand,  he  had   noobjection to restricting small holdings consisting of a cottage and half and acre to ex-service men.    He thought Mr. Chamberlain was wrong about the question of annuities.   The Committee which had considered the matter under Lord Cave did not recommend permanentcompulsory annuities, but only recommended them for two years, andas soon as the Cabinet sanctioned the expenditure of 20,000,OOOZ. itwas obvious that the scheme for compulsory annuities could not bemaintained.    He thought the decision of the Cabinet that the scheme should apply generally  should be allowed to  stand.     The PrimeMinister had made an emphatic appeal at the Cabinet, and from thesilence with which it was received he had assumed that there wasacquiescence.It would be possible in practice to restrict the grant of land to ex-service men, and Ins sympathies were to confine the Bill entirely to them, but the Prime Minister was strongly of opinion that thegeneral population must not be excluded. Under the Small Holdings(Colonies) Act a preference was given to the naval and militaryforces of the Crown who had served in the war.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that the -special provisions of theBill should be applicable only to ex-service men and that the ordinarySmall Holdings Acts should apply to the general population. If the20,000,0001. were now to be made available for general smallholdings, it would never in the future be possible to induce theCounty Councils to share in the expense of small holding schemes forthe general population. The Cabinet bad come to no decision in thematter and he had not assented.The President of the Board of Education said that his iinpres-sion of what had taken place when the Prime Minister addressedthe Cabinet on the 3rd March agreed with that of Lord Ernie.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that his impression wasthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer and he, who had the sameviews, did not press their opinions, and he had come to the conclu-sion that, while there was a general acceptance, the details were left.to be discussed and decided on afterwards. In actual fact therewould not be enough land to provide for more than the ex-servicemen. All the agitation he had come ^across in the country was limited to providing land to the men with actual service at thefront.Mr. Bonar Law said that his impression of the Cabinet discussion had been that, while the general population could not be absolutelyexcluded, the effect in practice would be to restrict the scheme to ex- &apos;service men. It had been argued that nothing was being done forthe agricultural labourers and that it was unfair to confine thescheme to soldiers, while men who had been compulsorily retainedon the farms for the benefit of agriculture and had not been allowedto go to the front, were not provided for. The Prime Ministersview was that, unless you could offer facilities to agricultural labourers to acquire small holdings, little good would come of the
Land Settlement proposals. He suggested that something should beinserted in the Bill to indicate that a preference should be given to ex-service men.Mr. Chamberlain said that, while it was quite true that no additional money would have to be provided beyond the 20,000,0001.if grants were made to agricultural labourers, it would neverthelessdevelop very strong pressure among the agricultural population toextend the scheme, and would also alter the whole system of financeby transferring the burden from the County Council to the Treasury.He would prefer to say that the special provisions of the Bill were in fulfilment of a SDecial obligation to the soldiers, and the Governmentwould be prepared to consider the claims of others at a later date.He would like the Prime Miuister&apos;s attention drawn to the fact thatthe arrangement come to between him and the Treasury under Mr.Bonar Law for the provision of 20,000,000/., was definitely restricted to ex-service men.Sir Auckland Geddes said that when he had been at the LocalGovernment Board, it had been agreed with Lord Ernie that thereshould be no clash between the Housing and the Land SettlemantBill, and the present proposal was quite a new departure. As amatter of fact, the officials of the Board of Agriculture had alwayswished to undertake rural housing.Dr. Acldison (who entered at this stage) explained that he agreed with Mr. Chamberlain that if houses were to be erected by theBoard of Agriculture under the Land Settlement Bill as parts ofsmall holdings at the rate of a house to half an acre of land it would,in effect, remove the rural districts entirely from the scheme of theHousing . Bill. But the actual arrangement was that, so far as concerned the building of the houses, the Housing Bill would apply,the financial arrangements of the Land Settlement Bill applyingouly to the purchase of the land. The County Council would bethe authority in each case, and arrangements would be made by theLocal Government Board that in rural areas the District councils should not exercise powers under the Housing Bill where cottageswith half an acre of land or more were concerned.Lord Ernie said that he had no objection to this proposal.Mr. Chamberlain said that he would be satisfied with the definition, of a small holding as a holding of not less than half an acrewith a cottage erected thereon, provided that the cottage be erectedon the terms of the Housing Bill, and that the County councils should be the Housing authority by arrangement with the Board ofAgriculture and the Local Government Board.The War Cabinet decided (1.) That the definition of a small holding in the Bill be approved.(2.) That houses to be built on small holdings should be built by county Councils under the provisions of the housing bill by which the cost is borne by the Housing authorityto the extent of a penny rate, and that for that purpose the County Councils should replace the Rural district councils.(3.) That the general scheme of the Land Settlement Bill neednot be restricted to ex-service men, but that provision should be made to give a preference to ex-service men.(4.) That such preference for ex-service men should apply inthe granting of credit facilities, but that the credit facilities should be open to all small holders.(5.) That the President of the Local Government Board should confer that afternoon with the President of the Boardof Agriculture and Fisheries as to the amendmentsnecessary to carry out these decisions and to securegenerally that the Land Settlement Bill did not conflict with the policy of the Housing Bill.
3. With reference to the Minutes of the 22nd Meeting of theHome Affairs Committee (Minute 3), Mr. Bonar Law stated that ithad been decided to abide by the previous decision of the War Cabinet(War Cabinet 455, Minute 15).The War Cabinet had under consideration the Schedule to theForesty Bill (Paper G.T.-6913), and decided that-The Schedule to the Forestry Bill should be referred to theCommittee under the Chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor,appointed by War Cabinet 539, Minute 1 (d), with a viewto securing that the provisions of the Schedule should follow the lines of the Land Acquisition Bill.4. With reference to War Cabinet 504, Minute 5, the WarCabinet had under consideration the following memoranda on thesubject of cereal prices in 1919 in relation to the pledges which theyhad given to farmers as to guaranteed prices : Memorandum by Lord Ernie (Paper G.T.-7000),Memorandum by Mr. Macpherson (Paper C.T.-7001),Memorandum by Mr. Munro (Paper G.T.-7005),together with the Minutes of the 23rd Meeting of the Home AffairsCommittee held on the 20th March, 1919.The President of the Board of Agriculture suggested in his memorandum that the War CabineCs pledge was not to be inter-preted as promising to pay the farmers a guaranteed price for allcereals harvested, but only those parts of the crops which were sold.In order, therefore, to prevent opportunities for fraud shouldimported cereals be sold at a lower price than the home-produced,he proposed that the guaranteed prices should&apos; apply, in the case ofwheat, to the whole crop, on the basis of 4 quarters to the acre ; inthe case of barley, to four-fifths of the acreage, on the basis of4 quarters to the acre ; and in the case of oats, to two-fifths of the acreage, on the basis of 5 quarters to the acre. The Secretary forScotland and the Chief Secretary for Ireland, in their memoranda,objected to this on the ground that the Governments pledge could he interpreted only as guaranteeing prices for the whole cropharvested.The President of the Board of Education said that this question had been discussed at the Committee on Home Affairs on the previous day, and, on account of the divergences of opinion as to the interpre-tation of the CabineCs pledge, it haft been decided to ask theCabinet for their interpretation.Lord Ernie said that the pledge had been given in the form of aQuestion and Answer, decided upon by the Cabinet and given in theHouse of Commons on the 19th November, 1918, as follows : &quot;Mr. G. Lambert (by private notice) asked if the President&apos;of the Board of Agriculture is able yet to say whether theprices paid to farmers for controlled cereals harvested in 1919will be. not less than those now current ?&quot; The President of the Board of Agriculture (Mr. Prothero):Yes, Sir ; the answer is in the affirmative.&quot;[826]-406 CReafforestation.Forestry Bill.Cereal Prices in1919.Powers to acquire 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration the question of-^an^- extending the powers of public authorities and others to acquire landcompulsorily, and decided that The matter should be remitted to the Committee on HomeAffairs, with special reference to the recommendationsthereon made by the Committee under the Ministry of reconstruction, on Acquisition and &quot;Valuation of Land,presided over by Mr. Leslie Scott (Cd. 8998).
Mr. Bonar Law said that he did not remember the exactwording that had been decided upon, but the intention of the Cabinetin giving their pledge clearly was that the same method of dealingwith the crops in previous years should be followed out in the case ofthe 1919-20 crop. As he understood that it had been the practice to apply the guaranteed prices only to what had been sold, the samemethod should be adopted for the next crop.Mr. Barrie observed that that was not the interpretation placedin Ireland on the Governments promise.Lord Ernie explained that the difficulty lay in regard to the oatcrop. In England and, he believed, in Scotland, the greater part ofthe oats was consumed on the farms. He held that the pledge givenreferred only to the amount that was sold.The President of the Board of Education said that he hadgathered from the discussion at the Home Affairs Committee thatthe representatives of the Scottish and Irish Boards of agriculture would accept the Gabinefs decision if it were announced that LordErnle&apos;s interpretation was the correct one, if it were also agreedthat the guaranteed prices should be paid for two-thirds of the crop of oats.Lord Ernie explained that it was estimated that one-fifth of theoat crop was generally sold off the farms. He had proposed thatthe guarantee should be given on one-half of the total crop, on theground that in Scotland and Ireland considerably more than one-fifth of the crop was sold, and because, since there was a large additionalarea under oats this year, the Scottish and Irish farmers would expect to sell more. He suggested that it would be quite sufficientif three-fifths of the crop were guaranteed. In reply to a question by Mr. Bonar Law, he said that the difference in the cost to theState between guaranteeing two-thirds and three-fifths amounted to between 2,0O0,000Z. and 3,000,0001.Mr. Barrie said that the Irish Department of Agriculture had gone into the matter carefully, and were satisfied that if two-thirds of the crop were guaranteed that would not be unsatisfactory,although there might be losses in some districts, and there wouldcertainly be much grumbling,Sir James Dodds said that, whatever interpretation the Govern-ment placed on their pledge, farmers in Scotland had interpretedit and would interpret it as applying to the whole crop. Even if theGovernment were prepared to pay on two-thirds of the crop,there was still the difficult^&quot;- that the Scottish farmers could claim that the effect of this decision was to give farmers in England andWales payment on the whole of their staple crop, which waswheat, whereas in Scotland the payment -was being made only on two-thirds of their staple crop oats. Another point that mightbe raised was that the Scottish tax-payer would be paying on a highscale for English wheat, with no chance, of obtaining a counter-balancing return on Scottish oats.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that, if theguarantee were given on the whole of the oat crop the Scottish tax-payer would be paying for the benefit of the Scottish farmer.Mr. Chamberlain enquired from Sir Arthur Boscawen whether hehad not said in the Llouse of Commons on the previous day that itwas proposed to guarantee four-fifths of the barley and oat crop.Sir Arthur Boscawen pointed out that he had referred only tothe case of barley, and that he had been wrongly reported in certainnewspapers.   He was having the reports corrected.The First Lord of the Admiraltj&apos; suggested, that unless theguarantee were given on the whole crop, the Government would belaying themselves open to the accusation of not keeping faith withthe farmers.* Mr. Bonar Law thought that the possibility of an attack of thisknid would depend upon the amount which the Government was prepared to guarantee.   He had certainly understood that the same
basis of guarantee would be adopted for the crop of 1919-20 as inthe case of the crop of 1918-19.Lord Ernie and Mr. Fisher both agreed that this implied a sale.Mr. Fisher said that there was another point upon which they desired the Cabinefs interpretation, namely, the guaranteed price.The point had been raised whether this should be what was termedthe &quot; commencing price &quot; or the average price over the season.Lprd Ernie said that his interpretation of the answer given toMr. Lamberfs question in the House of Commons was that the guaranteed price would be the price on the 19th November, 1918.The prices for cereals issued by the Food Controller were based on a scale which rose throughout the season, so that the average price of oats for the season would be about 2s. 6d. a quarter higher than theprice in November last year.Mr. Barrie explained that the price of oats at the beginning ofthe previous season was about 47s. 6d. a quarter, and at the end ofthe season about 52s. Gd. The average was 49s. 9d. a quarter, andthe current price in November last year was about 48s. 6d. a quarter.He suggested that there would be less discontent at the Cabinefsinterpretation of their pledge if the guaranteed price were taken at49s. 9d. a quarter.Lord Ernie said he thought the guaranteed price should be47s. 6d. a quarter, which was the current price on the date on whichtbe Government gave their pledge.Tbe War Cabinet decided To guarantee to farmers the following prices :  for the oats crop of the 1919 harvest, 44s. Id. per quarterof 312 lbs., oh the basis of 5 quarters to the acre on two-thirds of the total acreage under oats ;for the wheat crop of the 1919 harvest, 71s. lid. per quarter of 480 lb., on the basis of 4 quarters to theacre on the total acreage under wheat ;for the barley crop of the 1919 harvest. 61s. 6d. per quarter of 400 lb., on the basis of 4 quarters to tbeacre on four-fifths of the total acreage under barley :and approved the following decisions of the Home AffairsCommittee : (i.) To accept the alternative suggestion in the memorandumby the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries(Paper G.T.-7000) that the machinery of the corn production Act, 1917, be applied to the guaranteed prices ;(ii.) That in the purchase of oats for army requirements themilitary authorities should be required to purchase onlyin the United Kingdom ;.(iii.) The Irish Department of Agriculture should be authorisedto announce that as the outlook regarding the suppliesof cereals and imported feeding-stuffs had improved,some relaxation of the Order requiring compulsory foodproduction could be made.( iv.)To agree to Section 1 (6) of Part I of the Corn production act, 1917, which reads as follows : &quot;If it appears to the Board that any such land has been negligently cultivated, the Board may eitherwithhold altogether the payment to which the occupierswould otherwise have been entitled, or may diminish the amount of those payments to such extent as theBoard think proper to meet the circumstances of thecase.&quot;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 21, 1919.o
