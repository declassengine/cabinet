Evans, Assistant Secretary.The LahourSituation:The Miners&apos;Demands.[826]-4151 With reference to War Cabinet 548, Minute 1, Mr. bonar law said that he would give to the War Cabinet an outline of what he proposed, with their approval, to say to the miners that after-noon. The miners had intimated that they would strike, unless theGovernment gave concessions beyond the Sankey Report. Thequestion they pressed most was the one of hours, and they wishedto reduce the working hours from eight to seven in July, and to six,unconditionally, in July 1920. He proposed to say that theGovernment could not go beyond the Sankey Report, but that ifthere were any points which required i: terpretation the Govern-ment would be quite willing to submit these points to Mr. JusticeSankey and accept his ruling. Mr. Bonar Law added that he had written to the Prime Minister and had informed him of what he proposed to say.The Minister of Labour said that the Sankey Report recom-mended that the six hours should come into operation in July 1921,subject to the economic condition of the industry at that time.Sir Auckland Geddes said that he understood that at a meeting-of the Miners&apos; Federation the extremists had attacked Mr. Smillie.There was a sharp clea* age in the Federation bi-tween the extremistsand those that were led by Mr. Smillie, but he (Sir Auckland) was
told that Mr. Smillie would carry the day provided he thought thatthe Government had made all the concessions they possibly could.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the Government hadreally no choice, that their only possible firm standing-ground wasthe Sankey Report, and that they should undertake to accept it asit stood, both in spirit and in letter. Should there be interpretationneeded on certain points, these points, as had been suggested, couldbe referred to Mr. Justice Sankey, and his ruling accepted. once the Government began to modify the Report, they would be left with no answer to. the owners and users of coal, or to the minersthemselves if the miners said that the modifications were not sufficient. The Report was signed by impartial men, and it hadgenerally been recognised throughout the country that the con-cessions in it were very reasonable.Mr. Bonar Law sai,d that, once a debate started on the SankeyReport, certain sections of the community might think that too much had been given away. With regard to the question of nationalisation, the miners might say to him that the Report onthis matter was promised in twro months&apos; time, and might ask whether the Government would guarantee to carry out the recom-mendations of the Report. He did not himself see how he could give such a promise, and he thought he should tell the miners thatthe question must first be considered by the House of Commons.Lord Curzon said that there were three phases : (i.) The Report, (ii.) Its sympathetic consideration by theGovernment,    (hi.,) The views of the House of Commons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in reply to ademand from the miners for a guarantee on nationalisation, theymight be asked whether, if the Commission recommended nationalisa-tion on terms unduly favourable to the owners and ruinous to theState, the Government were to bind themselves in advance to acceptthe Report. He assumed that Mr. Justice Sankey, if he reportedin favour either of nationalisation or of some form of joint control,would recommend a particular scheme. He hoped the commission would take evidence on this question from persons other than coal-owners and miners, so that the effect of nationalisation on the Citymight be represented. . ,The War Cabinet concurred in the statement Mr. Bonar Lawproposed to make to the miners the same afternoon.Amendment to the 2. The Minister of Labour asked what was to be the Govern-Military Service merit&apos;s policy with regard to an amendment to the Military Service&quot;*&quot;cfc&quot; Act, in the name of Mr. J. M. Hogge, which was due to come up inthe House of Commons that afternoon. The amendment raised thewhole question of running the various civilian services by military labour in the event of a strike. He was of opinion that the amend-ment should be opposed, though this would be difficult withoutraisins; trouble.It was generally agreed that the amendment was one which theGovernment would require to oppose, but, owing to the industrial situation, it was most inopportune to raise a discussion on thequestion.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Reconstruction should endeavour to postpone the discussion on the Military Service Act in the House ofCommons.German Prisonersof War employedin this Country.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Reconstruction relating to the state of trade andemployment in Sussex (Paper G.T.-7022).
SirGermandecided by1919 (DM.Eric Geddes said that,prisoners   mentionedwith regard to the employment ofin the Memorandum, it had beena Conference of Ministers, held on the 16th January,-58, 4th Minutes), that all prisoners of war. other thanthose employed in agriculture, ironstone mines, and timber supply,should be returned to France at the earliest possible moment, andBritish labour returned in their place.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Acting Secretary should ascertain from the War Officehow far this decision had been carried out;(o.) The Acting Secretary should enquire of the President of theBoard of Agriculture if there was any prospect of an early release of the prisoners of war employed under the auspices of his Department.Parliamentary 4. The War Cabinet took note of the Parliamentary ElectionsElections (Soldiers) (Soldiers) Draft Bill (Paper G.T.-7017).Draft Bill. K &apos; y    1 &apos;Use of Troopsduring the threatened Strike.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (Paper G.T.-6997) regarding the use of troopsduring- the threatened strike, which had been under consideration onthe 19th March, 1919. In his Memorandum the Home Secretarysuggested that, if a strike on a large scale now occurred, generalauthority should be given, as in the railway strike in 1911, for theuse of troops in aid of the civil power, and that it should be left tothe military authorities to decide, as occasion arose, when and where they should be used with or without a requisition from toemagistrates. He understood that the Secretary of State for Waragreed with this view.The War Cabinet approved the proposals contained in theMemorandum by the Home Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.
