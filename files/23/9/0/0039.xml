1. With reference tq War Cabinet 550, Minute 1, the WarCabinet took note of Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram No. 570, dated the26th instant, which stated that, at a meeting with M. Clemenceau,President Wilson, and Signor Orlando on the previous day, Mr.Lloyd George, who was accompanied by the, Director of military intelligence, agreed that the balance of equipment originallydestined for General Denekin should be sent to Roumania. Thisbalance was said to amount to sets of clothing and equipment for150,000 men.2. With reference to War Cabinet 543, Minute 2, the WarCabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Minister of Muni-tions, on the subject of the utilisation of National Factories(Paper G.T.-7025).Allied Policy in 3. The   War   Cabinet   had   before   them   the   followingRussia. Memoranda: (a.) by Lord Curzon (Paper G.T.-7035).(&amp;.) by   the    Chief   of   the    Imperial    General    Staff(Paper P.-111a).Mr. Bonar Law referred to a report which had appeared inthe press that morning of a speech made by the French TJnder-Secretary of State for War in the Chamber of Deputies, referring to the forces on the Murman coast and in the South of Russia,from which he quoted the following extract: &quot; The Prime Minister has authorized me to tell you thathe would be false to his past attitude if he proposed sendingan expedition to Russia. From to-day, not a man will goto Russia, and those who are serving there are being relieved.&quot;The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that,when the matter had last been before the War Cabinet, it hadbeen decided that our policy should be to press for the earlyevacuation of Murmansk and Archangel. Since that decision hadbeen reached the British Commissioner at Archangel hadfurnished his views on the subject of the proposed evacuation,which he had briefly summarised in the Paper now before theCabinet. Apart from the military aspect of the situation, itwould be necessary for the Allies to arrange for the removal of,and to find a destination for, some 13,500 men of variousnationalities other than Finns, Poles, Esthonians, Letts andLithuanians, who, it was to be hoped, could eventually be repatriated to their own countries. Secondly, there was the ques-tion of the attitude to be adopted by the Allies towards the Pro-visional Government. In Mr. Lindley&apos;s view we were bound togive that Government fair warning. Such a notification, con-veyed at the present time, would have effects which would reactfar beyond Archangel. A third point was, was it possible or desirable to make terms with the Bolshevik Government, which no doubt would be glad to come to some agreement with us andto see the last of our troops. Such action, however, would run counter to the whole of our policy hitherto. In Mr. Lindley&apos;opinion, the right time for the evacuation to take place was not now, but in the autumn. He further recommended that 8,000troops should be sent out in order to cover the evacuation and to let the tired men there return home. He further pointed out that by the evacuation the fate of Esthonia, would be sealed, and the disastrous effect the announcement of our decision would haveupon the various States who were co-operating with us in fighting the Bolsheviks.Equipment forEoumania.Utilisation ofNational Factories.

WC 552The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed the view that weshould come to some arrangement with the Bolshevik Government.,if we could, in regard to the withdrawal of our troops, who werein a serious position. In regard to the suggested evacuation of thousands of men of other nationalities, few of whom had neverliftcd a finger in our support, he did not think that we were under any real obligation to do this.The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that considerabletrouble had been caused at Archangel by the behaviour of certainFrench troops who had been demobilised there, 150 of whom were now tinder arrest. He suggested that it was equally urgent forus to decide our policy in regard to the Baltic States. On a pre-vious occasion he had pointed out to the War Cabinet in what aperilous situation our troops there would find themselves when the ice broke.The Acting Secretary of State fortForeign Affairs expressed doubts as to the wisdom of the policy suggested by the Chancellorof the, Exchequer. Any recognition of, or negotiations with, evena provincial Bolshevik Government would give considerableimpetus to Bolshevik prestige throughout Russia. With regardto what the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff had said about theBaltic States, he had, in accordance with the recent War cabinet decision, written a despatch on the subject to Mr. Balfour whichhe would circulate shortly, pressing very strongly for a decisionof the Allies in regard to the policy to be pursued in that quarter.The War Cabinet decided: (a.) That the Secretary of State for War should furnish a paper giving particulars of the steps the War office had taken and were taking to prepare for theevacuation of our troops and such friendly inhabi-tants as we might be under an obligation to remove.(.&apos;&amp;.) To resume the discussion as soon as the War office programme had been circulated.The Secretary of State for War (who entered at this moment) said that the announcement of the Allied policy in theFrench Chamber completely compromised our position in north russia, and might gravely endanger the lives of our soldiers, ofwhom there were some 13,000 in that theatre. There was nothing to indicate whether the said announcement had been made withthe approval of the British delegates in Paris.Eetention ofPrisoners andSoldiers on theLand.Soldiers.4. With reference to War Cabinet 551, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (Paper G.T.-7042),and a Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland (paper g.T.-7056), on the subject of the retention of prisoners andsoldiers on the land.The President of the Board of Agriculture said that, owingto the bad weather of the last few months, work on the land hadbeen postponed. All farming operations, such as ploughing andsowing, would be taking place from now onwards, especially dur-ing the next two months. The present was a, bad moment to with-draw soldiers and prisoners from the land. At this time of year the Army generally lent additional men to farmers, instead of taking men away. There were still engaged on the land 27,000soldiers, 25,000 of whom the War Office wanted for the armies of Occupation. The farmers would only require them for thenext two months, and they could then be returned to the dutiesfor which the War Office was keeping them.Mr. Bonar Law said that to retain soildiers in agriculture would be in opposition, to the declared policy of the Government,to release from the Army all men who Avere not required for the armies of Occupation.
The Secretary of State for War said that it was impossible toexercise the power of enforcing compulsory military service forthe purpose of providing agricultural labour. Men who werebeing kept in the Army by the War Office were those who fulfilled,certain conditions as regards age and the time at which they joined the service. It was not possible to retain these men for any pur-. pose -except military service. If there was a surplus, the WarOffice would have to consider the modification of the conditions under which they were retained. It was intended to release fromthe Army all those who were not required for the Armies ofOccupation.The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested that, ifthe 25,000 men who were in agriculture would be kept in any case as a military reserve, there was no reason why- they should notbe employed in this country instead of being sent to Trance.The Secretary for Scotland said that if the soldiers could beretained on the land for the next two months it would make agreat difference to farmers. The War Cabinet should consider theeffect of taking these men away upon the agricultural community.The announcement of the guaranteed prices of cereals, which wouldtake place in the course of the next week, would raise a stormamongst farmers. If at the same time soldiers, whose workmeant so much to the farmers, were withdrawn from the land at such a busy period as&apos; the present, there might be a great dealof&apos; trouble.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the questionentailed more than the mere provision of agricultural labour.The Government at present were paying out-of-work donation to people who refused to take work. There, wets a shortage of menon the land, and at the same time we were asked to keep and paysoldiers for doing work which the people drawing unemployment donation refused to do. He thought it was time that the wholequestion of the out-of-work donation should be reconsidered.The War Cabinet decided that The withdrawal of soldiers from work on the land shouldcontinue, but should proceed as slowly as is consistent with our military requirements.Prisoners of War. The Secretary of State for War, referring to the request of the  Board of Agriculture to be allowed to retain German prisonersof war on the land, said that the War Office had no objection tooffer to this course. He thought the main objections in the countryand the House of Commons were to their retention in industry.In reply to Mr. Bonar Law, he said that he had certainly advised that all prisoners of war should be returned to France as soon as -possible, but he had proposed that exception should be made in thecase of those employed in agricultural and limestone quarries.The Minister of Reconstruction referred to a Paper(G.T.-7022) which he had circulated on the state of trade andemployment in Sussex, in which attention was called to the unrest occasioned by the continued employment of prisoners of warin that country. This condition of unrest had been growing sincethe declaration of policy iby the Secretary of State for War that.  prisoners would be returned to France.- The Minister of Labour agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer that the unemployment donation was a source of con-si der able anxiety, although it was true that a considerable reduc-tion had been made for the second period of payment in the caseof men, from 29s. to 20.s. a week, and, in the case of women, from25s. to 15s. a week. The lack of agricultural labour was accountedfor in some measure by the prevailing wages conditions. Beforethe War an agricultural labourer was earning 18s. a week corn-pared with 20s. a week earned by a railway porter in the samedistrict.   Since then, railwaymeus wages had been increased by
33s. a week, but agricultural wages bad not increased in the same proportion.The Employment Exchanges were supposed to scrutinise eachapplication for unemployment donations, but the volume of worklaid upon them had become very heavy, and it was possible thatit had occasioned irregularities in the granting of unemploymentdonations.The War Cabinet decided that Farmers should be permitted,  for the present, to retainGerman prisoners of war for work on the land.Office Aecommoda- 5. With reference to War Cabinet 471 (14) and War Cabinetfcion and Demobili- 550, Minute 2, the War Cabinet had under consideration a notesation- by Lord curzon (Paper G.T.-7039) relating to office accommoda-tion for the Department of Overseas Trade, together withMemoranda by the President of the Board of Agriculture(Paper G.T.-6864), the First Commissioner of Works (paper g.T.-6889), and the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-7026).Lord Curzon explained that it had become very necessary that adequate accommodation for the Department of &quot;Overseas trade should be provided close to the Foreign Office and the Board ofTrade. Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland&apos;s staff was working at highpressure and under great difficulties, with the result that their work was suffering, and many of the chief officials had broken down. The staffs of the. Foreign Office and of Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland&apos;s department were so overcrowded that it might benecessary at some future date to ask that the Colonial Office shouldbe given over entirely to house these staffs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in reply to a suggestion bythe First Commissioner of Works that new offices should be erected, said that there would be the strongest opposition in theHouse of Commons to the erection of additional buildings, whilethe premises still held by various departments were not beingvacated. He thought the proper procedure would be to bring pressure on departments to give up all the accommodationnecessary.The First Commissioner of Works said that, in his opinion,the Government would have to come to a decision to put up newblocks of buildings. He had already made a preliminary examination of various sites, but thought that it would benecessary to scrap the buildings in Whitehall Gardens andMontagu Blouse and to put up a new and&quot; modern block of officeswhich, would house a considerable staff. With regard to sir arthur Steel-Maitland&apos;s department, he could not requisitionpremises for his staff, as they were, not a war department. &apos; Hewas experiencing great difficulties in housing staffs of Governmentdepartments, because in a great many departments the rate ofdemobilising certain parts of the staff was not equal to the rateof increase, of other parts. At the same time, he was continuallybeing met with demands for accommodation which was requiredurgently. He instanced, in his connection, the occupation ofcertain nouses in Pall Mall by the Eastern Command. The WarOffice, however, had said that it was necessary for the EasternCommand to be housed in those buildings.Mr. Bonar Law enquired if Sir Auckland Geddes had gone into this matter at all (War Cabinet 550, Minute 2)iSir Auckland Geddes pointed out that, in accordance withthat minute, he had prepared a scheme, which he proposed to ask the Treasury to carry out, for obtaining a return from all depart-meuts of the numbers of their staffs, and the particular work that each, was doing, and a somewhat similar scheme with regard to[826-4441 C
Mr. Bonar Law said that he thought the Government shouldassist an ex-soldier to emigrate, and, provided Lord Milner&apos;sproposals were confined to ex-service men, for whom theDominions made suitable provision, he saw no objection to theirreceiving War Cabinet approval.The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the Prime Ministers approval, free passages tothe Dominions for ex-soldier settlers should beprovided.Communications 8. With reference to War Cabinet 525, Minute 4, the war board. Cabinet approved of  the appointment of the Hon. Sir HenryNorman,   Bart.,  as   Vice-Chairman of   the   communications committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 31. 1919.o
