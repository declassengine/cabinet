Reparation and 1. With reference to War Cabinet No. 535, Minute 3, the indemnity. Prime Minister explained that  the question of indemnities had reached a stage in the discussion in Paris at which he thought theWar Cabinet should consult together before deciding on their futureattitude. He had therefore asked the British delegates to the Inter-Allied Indemnity Commission to come over and report the position.Mr. Hughes said that the Commission had been engaged up tothe present in discussing general principles, that is to say, whatcategories of loss and damage came under reparation and what didnot come thereunder. After two or three weeks&apos; discussion theCommittee found themselves divided into two sections ; on the onehand, the representatives of the United States held that we wereprecluded from including the cost of the war in our claim for repara-tion. We had taken the position that we were entitled to includethe cost of the war, and neither side had receded from the attitude taken up. The Commission had therefore reached an impasse, and ithad been agreed that the matter should be referred back to theSupreme War Council with a request to the Council to interpret the precise meaning of the terms accepted on the 5th November.Lord Sumner said that the Americans had suggested that instead of the Commission interpreting the documents which were before it, they should ask the representatives who had signed the documents exactly what they had meant. The British attitude wasthat it was idle to do this as they were quite certain that Britain had never intended to give up her right to the inclusion of the cost of thewar in reparation.The Prime Minister asked what were the views of the French.Mr. Hughes said that the French views had been set forth byM. Klqtz and M. Loucheur. Their attitude could be summed up by saying that they recognised the principle that the right of the allied and Associated Powers to reparation was absolute, an order of priority being reserved for certain claims.Lord Sumner said that the French delegates had spoken speciallyin favour of our attitude. The attitude of the Belgians and theItalians was rather doubtful Belgium, in particular, wished toknow what they would get by way of reparation for destruction ifthe whole cost of the war were included in reparation. The Japanese- also were in favour of including the cost of the war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he understood that theFrench views were the same as ours on the question of integralreparation, but they went on to say that, having fixed a sum to be claimed, claims for reparation and damage actually done should haveprecedence over the cost of the war. As they meant, however, toput their claims for damage very high, the inclusion of the claim forthe cost of the war would not adversely affect them, but the exclusion of the claims would be very damaging to usJMr. Hughes said there were two questions to consider :-(1.) The attitude of the Americans, who denied that under theterms of peace made on the 5th November we had any right to olaim costs of the war.(2.) The attitude which would be very strongly taken by theFrench and the Belgians in favour of priority.The first question had been referred to the Supreme WarCouncil, and the second could not be considered until the answer ofthe Council had been secured.The Prime Minister pointed out that the urgent question was toreach a conclusion on the amount Germany could pay ; even if we took a long time to decide the distribution of this amount, it wouldnot stand in the way of peace, and it was very important that weshould make peace soon in order that trade might be restarted.Lord Cunliffe suggested that whatever we decided as toGermany&apos;s capacity to pay, she would say that she could not pay it.
He hoped that the Sub-Committee, of which he was chairman, whichwas considering Germany&apos;s capacity, would report at the beginningof the following week. He doubted, however, if the report would be unanimous. Thev were unanimous that what Germany could pay inthe next twTelve or eighteen months amounted to about a thousandmillions. He thought also that the American members would agreethat Germany would be able to pay a further eleven or twelvethousand millions during the next 37 years. He doubted whetherthe French would agree to the adoption of such a small figure.He desired the guidance of the War Cabinet as to whether theBritish delegates should agree to this figure. Personally, he was ofthe opinion that Germany could pay a great deal more, but it was amatter of guesswork ; the payment of any big sum would have tobe spread over about 50 years.Mr. Bonar Law said that it had been suggested that germany should pay by means of an annual tribute over a series of years,which would include the interest and sinking fund on the debt.The problem to decide was, what she could pay annually.Lord Cunliffe said that this would be an increasing amountyearly as Germany&apos;s prosperity revived.The First Lord said that it was difficult to arrive at a definitefigure of what Germany could pay. There was evidence to showthat she was spending money now in what we would consider anillegitimate way, for example, financing expeditions against poland and Northern Russia. Where did this money come from ? Hethought we should place an embargo on the purposes on which germany should be allowed to spend money.The Secretary of State for War asked whether any conclusionhad been come to as to the form in which payments should be made.How was the actual transference of objects of value to be carriedout ?Lord Cunliffe said that this would have to be done in theordinary way by means of goods or by credit In reply to thePrime Minister, wdto asked if we should be compelled to takeGerman i^oods as payment, Lord Cunlitfe said that we would only take ships, and the French only coal.The Secretary of State for War said that he understood thatGermany would build up credit in South America and other markets,and that we should buy goods on this credit.Lord Cunliffe concurred.The Prime Minister said the second question was, the order inwhich payments would be made. He had wired to Paris, although he had not had time to consult his colleagues before doing so, to theeffect, that if we agreed to the French proposal that reparation for damage should have first claim, we were not likely to obtain anythingfrom Germany. The French might make very extravagant claimsupon which it was impossible for us to sit in judgment. No oneknew7 what would happen in thirty or forty years&apos; time. It wasimpossible to be sure that we should continue to obtain 700 millions per annum from Germany for the whole of that time. He would prefer that we made certain of securing something during the firstten years. If Germany later refused to pay, we could only compelher to do so by going to war with her. The United States wouldcertainly not go to war, nor did he think vToulcl our people undertakeanother war in order to collect a debt. In all probability France,would not go to war, and certainly if her claims for reparation hadalready been met, she would not do so in order to enable us to collect the rest of the debt.Lord Sumner said that in his opinion the French did not know what their claim would be. They were at present engaged in legis-lating to set up local commissions which should go into the questionof the value- of the towns and houses which had been destroyed.They could not give a definite figure on any point. When it came to deciding claims, all they could do would be to put forward to the
Allied Governments a claim ad misericordiam. Our claim for shipssunk was quite as valid as theirs for houses destroyed, and ultimatelyhe thought they would be prepared to come to an amicable agree-in ent.The Prime Minister thought that there were two ways of dealingwith the French request for priority 1. To make no distinction between reparation and indemnity ;2. To give part priority only to reparation in some agreedproportion.It was imperative that we should not admit the French claim that thewhole figure for reparation should have absolute priority.The Secretary of State for War was of the opinion that our external debts in countries like the United States should be includedin the claims for reparation. (*ur debt to America was over 1,000millions. We had depended upon the United States for food andraw materials, and we had managed to get these commodities onaccount of the credit which we had built up in that country. the damage to our finances and our trade that had thus been incurredwas just as real as the material damage to France and Belgium.Pie thought our external debts should have priority next to claims for reparation for concrete instances of destruction. France, too,was in debt to the United States, and he thought that it would bea good thing if Germany could take over our debt and the Frenchdebt to the United States.Lord Curzon asked what guarantees could be secured thatGermany would pay. The threat of war might be effective for tenyears, but thereafter what guarantee or sanction for payment wouldthere be ?Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that if Germany acknowdedgedthe debt at all she could only get rid of it later by repudiation, andthat would not be easy.Lord Cunliffe thought it was being assumed that germany would be able to pay what we demanded, and at the same time keep up a great army and navy. The. intention was, however, to imposesuch a burden that she would not be able to maintain large armed forces.The Prime Minister said that lie wished to make sure of gettingsomething ; he was far more certain of what We would get in thefirst ten years than in the second ten years, and still more certain of securing something in the second ten years than in the thirdten years.Lord Sumner said that the Commission were trying to obtainat once all they could without crippling Germany. Germany wouldthen have to enter into commercial relations with various countries,and they would find it difficult to repudiate their debt later on.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the German debtwould be partly in the hands of individuals and partly in the handsof the Allied Governments. The debt to individuals she could notrepudiate, but she might recover sufficiently to feel strong enoughto repudiate the debt to the Governments.Lord Cunliffe said that the Allied Governments must convertthe German debt into negotiable securities and then transfer theseinto the hands of individuals.&apos; Mr. Bonar Law said that the debt could only be paid in gold,goods, or credit. Had they considered whether Germany could find700 millions yearly for this purpose?Lord Cunliffe said that five years ago no one would have thought we could have borrowed sufficient money to carry on thewar: The German debt would have to be paid mostly in credit, andhe thought that Germany would find any amount of credit the-United States, in any case, were quite prepared to grant themcredit.
Mr. Hughes said that if we merely asked for reparation, perhaps500 or 600 millions would cover it.The Prime Minister pointed out that we owed the UnitedStates 1,000 millions; we had transferred 500 millions to them insecurities and 400 millions in bullion. Our claim for material damage amounted to 800 millions, and- this total of 2,700 millions would all have to be included in claims for reparation.Sir John Bradbury pointed out that the figures given by thePrime Minister were our gross losses. We had transferred away agreat deal of bullion, but we had also had a great deal transferredto us, and in this respect we, were not much worse off than before,and if France and Russia paid their debts to us we should not on balance be losers.Mr. Hughes said that unless the Supreme War Councildeclared that they had not intended to waive their right to claim the costs of the war in their note of the 5th November, and hadnot in fact done so. and the Reparation Commission supported theirviewr, Britain could not even claim reparation for the 1,000 millionsowed to America, for this was clearly a debt as was the remainder of the 6,000 or 7,000 millions we had raised by war loans. There-fore it followed that, uidess we could claim costs of the war, Britainand the Empire would get little or nothing.The Prime Minister said that the British Cabinet stood by thedemand that reparation should include indemnities. He thoughtthat the Allies, perhaps, with the exception of the United States,would stand by us in this interpretation of reparation.Mr. Hughes said he did not think Belgium would support us.Lord Sunnier pointed out that this question of interpretationwas the one which was being put to the Prime Minister, PresidentWilson, M. Clemenceau, and M. Orlando.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that he was of the opinionthat the American view would be governed largely by the extent ofour demand. President Wilson would never agree to a demand for30,000 or 40,000 millions. If we came to a definite conclusion as towhat to demand from Germany, and if the American delegatesagreed with this, he did not despair of persuading the President ofthe United States to compromise on the matter. Unless our demand to Germany was unanimous, we would never obtain anything. Itwas better to ask for a smaller amount and to have the United states with us. With regard to the question of priority, he hoped the delegation would stand by their refusal to concede complete priority to anyone for reparation. He did not like the idea of having a secondmortgage on German assets. All sorts of unforeseen complicationsmight arise later on. He would like to see the cash in the first fewyears.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that two things were clear, first : that the British delegates should hold to our claim thatwe were entitled to integral reparation ; and second: that amongstthe Allies, we should resist any claim to absolute priority for&quot;reparation&quot; in the narrow sense. He would suggest, however,that the French delegates should be , sounded on the question ofgiving partial priority in certain cases.Mr. Hughes stated that he had done this unofficially. He had approached M. Klotz, and felt sure we could not expect support from Jthem on the question of priorities., Juord Sunnier pointed out that it was difficult for the delegation to suggest any specific proportion for partial priority ; it was rather a matter of policy for the Governments to decide in consultationHe thought, however, they could be authorised to say that, wdiilethey were completely opposed to the principle of absolute priority,the British Government might be prepared to consider favourablyany appeal which the French Government might wish to make tothem, and that claims of this kind would have to be dealt with by[826J-230 C
negotiation between Governments. At present the principalConference stood adjourned until they received the answer to thequestion which had been put to the four Prime Ministers. TheSub-Commissions were still sitting.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that, if we had to compromise at allin the end and give priority to the French claims, this priority shouldtake the form of letting them off the&apos;payment of their debt to us,which amounted to 500,000,0O0Z. or 000,(300,000/,.Mr. Hughes desired to know whether the delegation was togive way on the point at all; if so, how far and in what directionshould they give way. He hoped the Cabinet would give the delegation written instructions on this matter. He said that ifpriority was to be conceded it was a matter for the Government andfor the Commission. M. Van den Heuval had wished to take thequestion of priority, but we had refused to do this until the matterreferred to the Prime Ministers had been settled.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was all for putting our claims as high as possible, but, if we put them too high,we should be faced with the German Government refusing to *pay,and perhaps confronting us with a Germany that had no Government.Mr. Hughes said that the instructions to the British delgation had been that they should endeavour to secure from Germany thegreatest possible indemnity she could pay-subject to consideration of(1) the economic well-being of the British Empire, the peace ofthe world, (3) that no army of occupation should be necessary forits collection. Had we now to ask for something less than whatGermany could pay ?The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet stood by theinstructions that had been given to-the delegates. There were two questions. The first was: Should we stand for the inclusion ofindemnity under reparation in spite of the opposition of the americans? The answer to this was certainly in the affirmative.The second question was, whether priority should be given withinreparation as understood by -us. To this the answer was, that nopriority should be given, but that it might be possible to negotiatethis matter between the Governments.Lord Cunliffe said that the Sub-Committee were.agreed that allGermany could pay immediately was about 1,000 millions within thenext eighteen months.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was important that weshould secure a share of this.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that when thediscussion arose as to the inclusion or exclusion of indemnities inreparation, the French might agree with the United States to excludeindemnities if the United States would support the French claim forpriority.The Prime Minister said it was important to carry the americans with us. Capacity was the limiting factor, and if we getthe Americans to agree on the question of the amount, he thought itmight be possible to persuade President Wilson to admit the claim for indemnities up to that figure. He had had a message from sir john Beale to the effect that Germany had to find immediately 150millions in cash in order to pay for the foodstuffs, and fats that she would require to carry her on to the next harvest.At the same time the Reparation Commission expected to get150 millions from Germany towards the claims for reparation. , Thiswould seem to mean that Lord Cunliffe&apos;s estimate of 1,000,000,000?..would have to be reduced by 1 50,0OO,0.OOZ.Mr. Hughes said he understood Mr. Bonar Law had agreed thatGermany should pay for her food supplies in gold. He had br OUgi 51the matter up before the Reparation Commission, because bethought all the. assets of Germany were in the hands, of that Cpm-mission.&apos; The position was, that we had millions of tons of wheat to sell, and he had informed Sir John 1 Beale that we could not
The Railway With reference to War Cabinet 52-i, Minute 2, the PresidentSituation. of the Board of Trade informed the War Cabinet of the present-position in regard to the negotiations between the railway executive Committee and the executives of the National Union of railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen.The President of the Board of Trade said that two meetings hadbeen held between the Railway Executive Committee and therepresentatives of the two Unions, at which the items in their programmes were fully explained by the men and the financial effectof their demands placed before them It was suggested to them that,in view of the enormous cost involved in their programmes, theyshould submit amended claims, but neither Union was willing to take this course, and at the last meeting they pressed for a statement howfar the Government was prepared to go in the direction of conceding. their demands. The negotiations had now reached a stage when it became necessary to arrive at a decision as to the course to be taken,and, in particular, whether an offer was to be made to the men, and,if so, in what form.The President of the Board of Trade, continuing, stated that ifthe men&apos;s demands were conceded in full, it would mean that theGovernment would be faced with the permanent cost of operating the[826]-230 Dafford to sell on credit. Sir John Beale had told him, however, thatthe United States were selling their wheat on credit. We were now informed they were selling for cash.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he thought that the americans might he selling on credit to the enemy countries in the balkans, but not to Germany or Austria. As a matter of fact,Congress had refused to grant any money for relief in Austria, andit had actually been suggested that we should lend to Austria, whilethe United States would lend to us.Mr. Hughes said that until the question as to the interpretation of reparation had been settled by the Supreme War Council, theReparation Commission could not go on. If the answer was thatthe cost of the war could not be included, or if there was a divisionof opinion on the matter, we were back to where we had started.Mr. Bonar Law said that it would still be possible to continue with the estimate as to how much Germany could pay.Lord Sumner said that if Lord CunlifhVs Committee could issue a report stating that Germany could pay a definite sum, and if his committee could report that they could prove damages exceedingthat amount, there would be a great deal to work upon.The Prime Minister said that he thought that the first thingwas Germany&apos;s capacity to pay, then it might be possible to arguethe question out with the United States.Mr. Hughes said that be felt that until the Supreme WarCouncil had answered the question referred to it by the ReparationCommission no iv-al progress could be made.Lord Cunliffe stated that he hoped ids Committee would reporton the following Monday.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the British delegates to the Inter-Allied Commissionon Reparation should not recede from the attitude adopted, viz., that the British Government includedindemnities as part of reparation, and had done nothing to invalidate their claim for indemnities ;(/*.) That they should oppose any claim for priority, but thatthey might intimate that the question of partial priority in certain cases was a matter which might be arranged by negotiation amongst the Governments concerned.
railways plus 120,000,0001., which addition was equivalent to the gross earnings of the railways prior to the war. The men&apos;s representatives were impressed with the importance of these figures, which were notchallenged, and the two General Secretaries, Mr. Thomas andMr. Bromley, had said they did not wish to present an ultimatum tothe Government as the miners had done, hut desired to arrive at - anagreement by discussion. Sir A. Stanley-suggested that the railway executive should offer that a part of the present war wage (33s.)should be converted into permanent wages and deducted fromthe war wage, so as to yield an advance of 50 per cent, on thepre-war wage. The remainder of the war wage, say 20s., shouldcontinue as such, and be decreased gradually as the cost of livingwas reduced. Thus a permanent rate of wages would be reached.This concession would mean a considerable increase on the wages paid before the war. The average pre-war wage was 25s., or withovertime, 28s. 6d., and the amount earned varied between 18s. forplatelayers and 4 5s. or 48s. for drivers, and they would now receive a minimum wage of 30s. for the lower grades up to 67s. 6d. or 72s.for engine drivers. On the assumption that the standard rates weieincreased by 50 per cent., and the other subordinate demands (over-time, night duty, and holidays) were refused, the estimated additional cost of working the railways would be approximately 55,000,OOOZ.,made up as follows :  Increase in wages bill after war wagehas disappeared       ... ...    25,000,000Eight-hours&apos;day ... ...    10,000,000Materials ... ... ...    15,000,000Rates and taxes ... ...     5,000,00055,000,000This compared with the present deficit of 90,000,OOOZ.The Prime Minister said that it would be impossible to keep themen on the pre-war rates, and be doubted whether the concessionsuggested by the President of the Board of Trade would beaccepted. It should be remembered that a very considerable per-centage of railway workers was drawn from the agricultural classes,whose wages before the war were between 15s. and 18s., but had now gone up to from 30s. to 40s.In answer to a question by the Prime Minister, the First Lordof the Admiralty stated that it was difficult to saj^ whether theagricultural wage would go back or not. The wage varied all overthe country ; in some places they were now making bigger demands,but in others they were only at the point of the first advance which followed the Corn Production Act. The agricultural labourers were generally relieved to find that with the increased wage they werenot asked to alter their hours, but there was a feeling in some districts that the wages would have to be lowered when affairs were more stabilised.Sir H. Walker said that Sir A. Stanley&apos;s proposition meant that the platelayer would be stabilised at 30s.    With this rate of pay he thought that some difficulty might be experienced in obtaining agricultural labourers.Sir A. Butterworth said the present proposals of Sir A. Stanleywould not mean any substantial immediate advance for the railway-men, but when food prices fell their wage would not fall belowa certain point, wdiich would be considerably higher than the pre-warstandard. Mr. Bromley had naturally laid stress on the fact thatthe effect of the flat rate of the war bonus had been to greatly alter the relative wage level of the different grades. The platelayer had obtained an advance of 160 per cent., as compared with the 60 percent, of the drivers. Sir A. Stanley&apos;s proposal would immediatelyhelp to,restore the pre-war ratios between the various grades.
The Prime Minister said he would like to know what effect the present reduction in food prices had on the wage question. Piehimself had worked out that it would mean about 3s. per week perfamily.The Minister of Labour said that the railwaymen were under anagreement whereby their wages would fall with the reduction in theprice of food. It might be suggested to Mr. Thomas that the merrswages should stand at the present level for six months, after whichthe situation would he reviewed, provided that the other demands were given up.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he thought there was much to be said for this suggestion, inasmuch as, in spite of the factthat food prices were now being lowered, they might rise again. our refusal to sustain the Spanish and Swedish Exchanges would meangreater pressure on the United States Exchange, and ultimately arise in the sterling price of food.The President of the Board of Trade thought that there were two difficulties in the way of this proposal: the men would beannoyed if no result were obtained from all the discussions, and also at the disregard of the other suggestions which they had putforward.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the President of the Board of Trade should negotiate with the representatives of the men on the basis that a portion of the present war wage should be converted toa permanent wage and added to the pre-war wage, theremainder of the war wage to be diminished further asthe cost of living falls in accordance with tbe presentsliding scale or some modified scale ;(b.) That should the President of the Board of Trade be unableto reach an agreement on the above lines, and further large concessions were demanded by the men, he should again bring the matter before the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 26, 1919.
