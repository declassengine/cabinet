With reference to War Cabinet 511, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War (Paper G.T.-6824) in connection Avith thetreatment of soldiers during Parliamentary Elections.Mr. Churchill said that the Memorandum, which he had circulated, merely proposed legislation on the first convenient opportunity for what it had been found necessary to do in actualpractice during the present Parliamentary Elections.The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals made by the Secretary of State forWar in his Memorandum (Paper G.T.-G824).Policy in Russia.5. Mr. Churchill said that there were several questions, viz.,Treatment of Conscientious Objectors, New Army Bill, and Policyin Russia, which, if practicable, he would like the War Cabinet toconsider on the following day. The question of what was to be our policy in Russia was an urgent one, since the position in thisconnection was more or less the same as it had been six weeks before.After a short discussion as to the urgent questions which hadto be considered by the War Cabinet on the following day The Prime Minister said that, with reference to our policy inRussia, the matter had been discussed three times at Paris. It wasnot the fault of the British delegates that no definite decision had as yet been arrived at. The question was one which must bediscussed at Paris, since it was not a question of coming to anagreement with one Government, but the views of the representa-tives of five different Powers had to be taken into account. Thepolicy of the British Government had been agreed upon and actuallystated in writing. The further discussion of the matter was being held over until his return to Paris, and he would then press forthe adoption of the policy wdiich had been decided on by the WarCabinet, in the first instance, as being the best to pursue.Mr. Churchill said that the Chief of the Imperial General staff had prepared four proposals for giving effect to the Cabinet policy.What he wanted the War Cabinet to do was to approve of certain measures being taken. There might be a serious disaster at archangel in the coming spring unless an early decision werecome to.The Prime Minister asked whether, if, as proposed, the question were discussed, the War Cabinet were to be invited to take adifferent view to that which they had already agreed upon.. Thequestion of our policy in Russia was one which could only be usefully discussed in conjunction with our Allies.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested that theSecretary of State for War should arrange for the circulation to tU9War Cabinet of the Memorandum which had been referred to.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should arrange for the circu -tion of the War Office Memorandum.Naval Forces inthe Black Sea.ti. A telegram, was submitted (Admiralty telegram No. 278 fromCornmancler-in-Chief, Mediterranean) asking the consent of hisMajesty&apos;s Government to the grant of active assistance by the naval forces now in the Black Sea to the forces operating under general denikin in that neighbourhood.It was decided, in accordance with the policy now being pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government in that quarter, that Such assistance might be given provided that no Naval forces were landed without reference to, and permission from, HisMajesty&apos;s Government.
