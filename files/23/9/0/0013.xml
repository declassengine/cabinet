Industrial Unrest: I. With reference to War Cabinet 525, Minutes  2 and 3,Tube Strike. Mr. Shortt said that the Committee appointed that morning by the threatened London Cabinet had gone into the question of dealing with the UndergroundElectrical Strike. Railway and the electrical power stations. With regard to thepower stations, he had seen representatives of the companies concerned and had arranged for the formation of a Committee of engineers from these power stations, under the Chairmanship of SirHamar Greenwood. It was calculated that not more than ten ortwelve men at each power station would remain loyal, but with thisstaff and voluntary assistance, which, they were endeavouring toobtain from the electrical educational institutions in London, it was hoped to maintain a sufficient supply for the streets, hospitals, andcold storage. With regard to the Underground Railway, Sir albert stanley and the Railway Executive were satisfied that it would beimpossible to keep these services going with voluntary drivers, and only confusion Avould result if this were attempted. The only alternative was to develop the surface 1 routes, and the Committeewere strongly of opinion that motor lorries should be obtainedfrom the Army and the Air Force, with military drivers.These lorries would ply along the main arteries leading intoLondon. At the same time the Committee considered that astatement should be issued to the press, pointing out thatthese were not bond fide strikes, but a Bolshevik attack upon thewhole public, and therefore the Government were taking steps tomeet the situation, which they would not have taken in an ordinaryindustrial dispute. It was considered that if an announcement onthese lines were issued in the press, the Army would not regard the utilisation of their services, as strike-breaking. In reply to aquestion, Mr. Shortt said that it was estimated that 1,000 lorries and200 Ford vans. and ambulances could be obtained. Mr. Blain, thehead of the London General Omnibtis Company, and Mr. Elliott, ofScotland Yard, were now working ottt a service for these motorlorries, and if the War Cabinet sanctioned their use it was hoped to start operations on the following morning. There was then thedanger that the &apos;bus drivers themselves might strike, but Mr. Blainwas of the opinion that the &apos;bus drivers might strike in any case,and the Governments action would have a steadying influence.Mr. Churchill said that he favoured the action suggested by theHome Secretary. He gathered from his Military Advisers that themen would support the Governments action, provided that thematter was properly handled in the press. This action was un-doubtedly crossing the frontier line, and, if decided upon, shouldbe carried out vigorously. It settled the question of principle, and,in his opinion, the Government should only be deterred if anyquestion arose as to the loyalty of the soldiers. He was a little-doubtful with regard to Air Force mechanics rnamhng the power stations. The press should be at once prepared for the government&apos;s policy.Mr. Bonar Law considered that the statement to the Pressshould say that the Government could not countenance suddenstrikes of this kind, which were organised by a minority for thepurpose of penalising the innocent, and not for the purpose of influencing the employers,, and that these were not proper strikesbut a deliberate anti-social movement. With regard to applying theAct of 1S75 to the present situation, Mr. Bonar Law said thata Privy Council was being summoned on the following clay for thispurpose. In his opinion this was a more serious step than thedecision to use motor lorries, as the Trade Unions would saythat it was a power which the Government could resort to in anystrike. He hesitated to take this step without the advice of theLaw Officers of the Crown, and they were at present in Paris.Mr. Shortt explained that the intention was to make regulation under the Defence of the Realm Act, and the order would be limited to the breaking of contracts in connection with
the statutory power to supply public necessities. It was not likean Act of Parliament, which would have to be repealed.Mr. Munro suggested that had electricity been as far developed as gas and water works in 1875, it would have been includedin the Act.Sir Robert Home said it was at present a penal offence to cutoff the electric supply.Mr. Churchill said he was in favour of adapting the 1875 Act,and using it in the present circumstances. It was verj- important to stigmatise as illegal the conduct of the strikers. It would show the disaffected minority that the Government meant to deal withthe situation with a firm hand. He was of the opinion that, if thiswas realised, the rowdy element would collapse very shortly.Mr. Bonar Law said that the 1875 Act should be used withcaution, as it might frighten every form of organised labour, andit had never been used in j)previous strikes.Mr. Chamberlain thought the application of this Act inthe present circumstances was a less dangerous step than the useof motor-lorries with soldier drivers. If, however, the militaryauthorities thought the army would carry out orders, then he was satisfied. It should, at the same time, be realised that if the attempt to use soldiers for this purpose failed it might well lead to soldiers refusing to act in support of law and order, which theyhad hitherto, and notably at Glasgow, never failed to do.General Childs thought there was little doubt that the army would carry out its orders, provided the situation was put to themin the right way, and that the press was favourable.The Adjutant-General agreed with this view, but said therewas always the possibility that the men would disobey orders,though they would be dealing now with a different class of men tothat which marched to Whitehall demanding to be demobilised.He suggested that orders might be issued to army lorry-drivers,proceeding along the streets in the ordinary course, permittingthem to pick up people travelling to business.Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that the lorries had that daybeen used, unofficially, to carry people, and that should be doneincreasingly.   It would be a useful index of the soldiers&apos; attitude.Mr. Churchill said he would want two or three days&apos; noticebefore the order regarding the use of the lorries was issued, inorder that the Press might be effectively used.General Homer said it would greatly assist to have at least two days&apos; notice. He could not guarantee the condition of the troops,as there had been trouble at Kempton Park, Battersea, and Black-heath.Mr. Chamberlain said it must be remembered that we were not asking soldiers as soldiers to drive these lorries ; they were skilled men who, although in uniform, might argue that they were being used, to break a strike in which the strikers might be in the sameunion as themselves.Some discussion then took place as to whether a statement asto the position should be issued to the press, and, if so, whether itshould be communicated that evening cr the following day.Lord Curzon said he could not share these alarms regardingthe steadiness of the soldiers. In his opinion the proposed orderswould be very popular amongst them. The public would want toknow if the Government was going to act, and there would not bemuch information to give them on this point until the Orderin Council regarding the 1875 Act had been sanctioned on thefollowing morning.Mr. Churchill said it would not do any great harm if the pressdid call for action by the Government. In any case, it wouldappear in the papers that the War Cabinet had met that evening toconsider the situation, and to this announcement might be added[826]-151 B 2
words to the effect that it was learnt that immediate action of a far-reaching character had been decided on.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) All preparations for the us&quot;e of Army and Air Force motorlorries with military drivers to relieve the presentsituation should be made, but that the orders to use these lorries should not be given without furtherinstruction from the War Cabinet;(6.) The Secretary of State for War should at once informArmy lorry drivers who happened to be proceedingalong the streets that they were permitted to pick uppassengers ;(c.) The 1875 Act regarding the arrest of persons employed ongas and water services leaving, their posts without permission should be adapted by Order in Council tomeet the present circumstances ;(d.) An unofficial communique should be made to the press onthe following lines :-. v&quot;:;PThe Cabinet met again this evening and had underconsideration the grave condition caused hy some of thepresent strikes on the part of comparatively smallsections of men which aim at inflicting the greatest possible distress on the community, and are not in any sense in the nature of industrial disputes. It is under-stood that the Government contemplate taking immediate action in the matter.Underground 2. With reference to War Cabinet 525, Minute 2, Mr. BonarStrike. Law read to the War Cabinet a letter he had received that afternoonfrom Mr. T. Bromley, the General Secretary of the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, in which he asked that Mr. Bonar Law or the War Cabinet should receive a deputation from the Society in order that their case in regard to the eight-hourday might be presented. Mr. Bromley alleged that the War cabinet were not fully acquainted with the mens side of the question, andthat their position had been unfairly represented. Mr. Bromley alsoaccused the Government of a breach respecting the Eight-hour DayAgreement. Mr. Bonar Law said he proposed to reply to this com-munication in the sense that he would be glad to find time to receivethe deputation, but that his doing so would be misleading, and wouldhave the effect of making the position worse, adding that the WarCabinet were fully informed as to the position.The War Cabinet approved the reply Mr. Bonar Law pro-posed to send.Kelease of IrishMen and WomenInterned in english Prisonsunder Defence ofthe EealmPenulatio n 14 b.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration three memoranda on the subject of the release of Irish men and women interned in english prisons ; the first, by the late Chief Secretary (Paper G.T.-6560), the second, by the late Colonial Secretary (Paper G.T.-6571),the third, by Mr. Barnes (Paper G.T.-6660).The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that both Mr. Shortt andMr. Barnes had, a few weeks back, recommended the release of Irishprisoners in England. Their view had now been accepted by theLord Lieutenant, who was pressing very strongly for their releasethat very day. Mr. Macpherson said that he was in agreement with lord French, and he would ttrge the Cabinet to give their approval.Mr. Bonar Law said that ever since the Coalition Governmentwas formed it had persistently acted, with regard to Irish affairs, on
the advice of the Irish Government. Lord French, who had pre-viously been resolutely opposed to the release of these prisoners, now appeared to have completely changed round.Lord Curzon said that a short time ago Lord French had seenhim personally, and had implored him to urge the War Cabinet to stand firm and not give way to any agitation for their release. Hethought it could hardly be in the interests of public order in Irelandthat these men should be let out.Mr. Macpherson said that he also had seen, the Lord Lieutenanta few days before, when the whole question had been fully discussed,and the conclusion they had both reached was that the men shouldbe released. There was a strong agitation in Ireland demandingthat these men should be granted their freedom, and this agitationhad now reached the Church. He wished to point out that JohnMacLean, who had been given five years&apos; penal servitude for sedition,had been released during the recent election ; whereas of thesetwenty-eight Irishmen, all of whom had been interned without anytrial, not one had been allowed to light his own election. As hadbeen pointed out in Mr. Shortt&apos;s Paper, the provisions under whichthese men were interned were as follows : Section 1 of the Defenceof the Realm (Amendment) Act, 1915, can be suspended : (a.) In tlie e\*ent of invasion, or(h.) In the event of other special military emergencies arisingoit 1 of the present war.Where action was so suspended, as had been the case in Irelandsince the rebellion of Easter, 1916, any person suspected of acting or having acted or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to thepublic safety or the Defence of the Realm, could be arrested andinterned without trial. The arrest and internment of these men hadtaken place thirteen to fourteen months after the Easter rebellion.Having regard to the present state of feeling in Ireland, it was, inhis judgment, no longer possible to keep these people locked upby maintaining the suspension of Section 1 of the above Act.Lord Curzon maintained that, when the Cabinet had consideredthe question of the release of John MacLean, they were generallyreluctant to let him out, and they had particularly consulted lord french as to whether MacLeahs release would prejudice the LordLieutenants position, and Lord French had replied in the negative(War Cabinet 508, Minute 9).The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that Lord French had that very day sent three urgent telephone messages pressing for therelease of all the twenty-eight that night. Mr. Macpherson then read a letter from the governor of Reading gaol to the HomeSecretary, to the effect that it was practically impossible to maintainany discipline among the Sinn Fein prisoners, and unless there was an immediate prospect of their release, special steps would have tobe taken to restore discipline. There were, moreover, signs thatthey would resort to a hunger strike.The Secretary of State for War hoped that the Cabinet wouldnot be in any way influenced by the possibility of the presentauthorities having to resort to forcible feeding. In the case of thesuffragettes a few years back the Government had. stood firm, andthey ought to do so in the present instance. The prison authoritiesought themselves to fx-) capable of keeping order in gaols, and theGovernment should not be asked to arrive at an important decisionbecause those authorities were afraid of disturbances. He himselfdid not contemplate any trouble in Ireland. In his view there wasno place in the world where there was less danger at the presenttime, and he was satisfied that the troops there could be relied upon.He thought that the Cabinet could not be expected to come to alightning decision on so important a political question.The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that his point was that
these twenty-eight men were detained in prison without having been convicted of any crime or given any trial. Moreover, they had since been elected as Members of Parliament, and consecpiently couldclaim privilege if they chose.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that, as his Papershowed, he himself had been in favour of their release when he wasChief Secretary, but this view had not been shared at the time byLord French. Lord French had now changed round, and bethoughtthat the reason why he was pressing for the immediate release ofthese men was that the new Parliament had assembled that day.Lord Curzon thought that the War Cabinet should not come toa decision without knowing the reasons which had caused the lord lieutenant to make such a volte-face.Mr. Bonar Law concurred in Lord Curzon&apos;s view, and thoughtthat the Chief Secretary should inform the Lord Lieutenant that theWar Cabinet were unable to understand this sudden change of view on his part, and until he could submit his reasons for his alteredopinion the War Cabinet did not feel in a position to arrive at adecision. The War Cabinet must have more details than were givenin the telephone messages. As the Cabinet were aware, grantingthese men their freedom would be interpreted by the country generally as an act of weakness, and the present moment was mostinopportune for any apparent surrender on the part of the Govern-ment to agitators.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief Secretary for Ireland should reply at once to the lord lieutenant, saying that the Cabinet must be placed inpossession of the latteFs reasons for his change of opinion in regard to the release of the twenty-eight Irishmeninterned in England before they could decide so importanta question.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,February 5, 1919.o
