Industrial Unrest: 1. The Shipping Controller said that with regard to the question the Shipping of the transport of Polish divisions, he wished to take this oppor-Position. tunity of drawing the attention of the War Cabinet to the presentposition in regard to the output of shipping. We had been, andwere being, faced with a series of very serious strikes, and unlesssomething could be done to relieve the situation, the outcome mustbe most grave. The unrest affected practically the whole of those employed in the shipbuilding and repairing industries, &amp;c, e.g., theboilermakers, shipwrights, and the riveters, &amp;c. He and his advisershad been doing their best to see whether some adjustment were notpossible. Some of the leading shipbuilders were in favour of a 44-hour week. What he felt was wanted was a bigger vision and a firmergrasp of tbe whole situation. At present the loss of money to theState and the diminished output in shipping was very great.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Associated Society of engineers and the Associated Unions had recently agreed to a47-hour week. This course had been arrived at by the Union leadersafter a long and tedious struggle with the extremists. In his view the Government must support the Union leaders who were standing by the agreement. It had just been decided to set up an IndustrialCouncil consisting of representatives of the employers and the men,to examine all questions of hours, wages, control, and other factorsaffecting the situation, and he was of the opinion that no isolatedaction could be taken to relieve the shipping position. It would befor the Council to include in their investigation an examination ofthe shipping situation. At the same time it would be well if theShipping Controller discussed the matter with the Minister ofLabour.Transport of Polish 2. The War Cabinet had before them Foreign Office telegramsDivisions. Nos. 374 and 377 of the 25th February, and No. 379 of the 26thFebruary, from Paris, urging that immediate steps should be takento provide British shipping for the transport to Poland of three Polishdivisions now in France.The Shipping Controller said that it was impossible to find thenecessary shipping unless it were withdrawn from other services.As he had already pointed out (vide Minute 1), shipping had beenimmensely retarded by strikes. Cargo ships were not suitable forthe transport of troops. Most of our available shipping suitablefor the purpose was already locked up for the purpose of repatriatingAmerican, New Zealand, and Australian soldiers. In reply to an enquiry as to whether certain ships now being used for the repatriation of American troops could not be temporarily diverted for the conveyance of the Polish divisions, Sir Joseph Maclay said thatthe ships in question were unsuitable and too big for the ports accommodation at Dantzig.   France was very keen on the conveyance of these Polish troops, but was not in the least interested in thequestion of ships. It seemed to him that Marshal Foch hadpractically disregarded the shipping position when making his recommendations.By the terms of the armistice, certain German merchant ships were to be handed over to us, but nothing had been done. Further,a good deal of shipping was required for the conveyance of food tothe enemy countries. So far he had refused to divert our own ships for this purpose until German vessels were made available. Hesuggested that the best way of conveying the Polish troops back totheir own country would be to send them by rail across Germany.He desired, further, to point out that transports conveying troops toAustralia could bring back wheat and meat, which was most urgently needed. The price of wheat in Australia was only about half thatobtained from the United States.The Secretary of State for War said that there were military reasons against our taking extreme measures to force the Germans
Aliens in Command 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theof British Ships. President of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-6869) in which he stated that during the war the Admiralty had confined the issue of confidential Route and Sailing Instructions to masters of merchant ships who could be regarded as entirely trustworthy and, as they found that British merchant vessels had in some cases been commandedbefore the war by foreigners, they had made it their practice to refuseto give these Confidential Instructions to masters who were not&quot; British born of parents who, at the time of their son&apos;s birth, were themselves British subjects by birth or by naturalisation.&quot; It was anessential part of the Government War Risks Insurance Scheme thatthe master of a merchant ship insured under the Scheme must obeyall Admiraltj7 instructions, and it was accordingly impossible for a.&apos; .       &apos;    British shipowner to get the Government War Risks Insurance for to relinquish their merchant shipping. He pointed out that theimmediate provision of shipping for the convej7ance of the Polishdivisions was necessary in order to give effect to the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, winch was to create a strong Poland.For this purpose it was vital to convey these divisions to their own country with the least possible delay. In the view of the militaryauthorities it was more important to get the Polish troops backto Poland than to complete the repatriation of Australian andNew Zealand soldiers.General Kirke, in reply to a question, said that the number oftrains required for a division was from thirty to forty. As regardsthe Shipping Controllers suggestion that the troops might be sent by rail, he understood that Marshal Foch bad considered this alternative, but had rejected it as impossible.The Chancellor of the Exchequer doubted the wisdom of sendingPoles by rail through Germany, especially the north of Germany.He thought that such action would almost certainly be provocative.The Prime Minister said that he agreed with the Chancellor thatthe despatch of troops through Northern Germany might&quot; conceivablycause trouble, but he felt strongly that both France and theUnited States were rather inclined to make use of Great Britain,and British shipping in particular, for certain purposes, while theyrespectively claimed the credit for the services rendered. TheUnited States for instance, posed as the feeder of the CentralEmpires, but wished to use British shipping. France again, posedas the recreator of Poland, but wanted our vessels in order to carryout this purpose. He recognised the necessity of repatriating thesePolish troops, if possible, but in his view we could not accept thewhole burden of transporting them. We were quite willing to do our share, but it must be on the understanding that both Franceand the United States were prepared to make contributions on their part.The War Cabinet were agreed as to the desirabilitv of trans-porting the three Polish divisions with the least possible delay, and decided That the Acting Secretary, in consultation with the ShippingController, should reply to the telegrams wmich had beenreceived from Paris in the sense that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, having regard to the many urgent demands whichwere being made upon British shipping at the presenttime in connection with the feeding of the Central Empires,the repatriation of American, Australian, and New Zealandtroops, &amp;c, were unable to undertake the whole burden ofconveying the Polish divisions. His Majesty&apos;s Government,however, would be prepared to take a share in furnishingthe necessary tonnage provided that France and theUnited States each contributed a substantial proportion.
his vessel unless he gave the command to an officer who was inthe category of those who received the Admiralty ConfidentialInstructions. Thus, although there had been no statutory require-ment that the command of a British ship should only be in the handsof a British subject either before or during the war, the command ofa British ship was in effect limited to British subjects during thewar, with certain exceptions.The President of the Board of Trade stated that it was pro-posed, after a conference between the representatives of the Boardof Trade, the Admiralty, and the Ministry of Shipping, and pending a fuller consideration of the general question whether in peace timeBritish ships should be allowed to be commanded by aliens, to make a defence of the Bealm Regulation that would merely effect duringthe remainder of the war the same object as was achieved by theAdmiralty in connection with the issue of Confidential Instructions.The following Defence of the Bealm Regulation was proposed : &quot; 37 d. A person shall not, unless specially authorised for thetime being by the Admiralty or Board of Trade, act in the capacity of master or person in charge of a British merchant ship unless he is a natural-born British subject, and the son of parents both of whom were at the time of his birth eithernatural-born British subjects or British subjects by naturalisation-tion ; and if any person acts in contravention of this Regulationhe shall be guilty of a summary offence against these regulations.&quot;Sir Albert Stanley stated that it was also proposed that theAdmiralty Committee for considering these questions should con-tinue, and that an officer of the Board of Trade should be appointed as a member of the Committee.The First Lord stated that he concurred in the proposed action.The War Cabinet approved the Defence of the Realm Regulationas proposed by the President of the Board of Trade, andalso the addition of an officer of the Board of Trade as amember of the Alien Masters Committee.Transference of functions of theWar Trade Depart-meut to the Boardof Trade.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-6883) in which he stated that Lord Emmott and Sir N. Highmore desired to retire from the War Trade Department at the end of March.The President of the Board of Trade said that the administrative work of the department must continue so long as there were anyprohibited exports. As the transference of War Trade Departmentfunctions to the Board of Trade was desirable at an early date, inorder that the amalgamation with the Restriction of ImportsDepartment already under the Board of Trade might be possible, he asked the sanction of the War Cabinet to make the change withoutdelay.The War Cabinet approved The transference of the functions of the War Trade Department&apos; to the Board of Trade.Possible Goal 5- The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theStrike and Unem-     Minister of Labour (Paper G.T.-6882) relating to the question ofj)loYinent Donation,   whether unemployment donation should be paid to workpeople, whobecame unemployed in consequence of coal strike.,: The Minister of Labour stated  that  the   present  practicefollowed the rules governing unemployment insurance ; workpeoplerendered unemployed by a trade dispute did not get unemployment
unemployment donation:Reduction of Scale.Supplementaryand other assistance to the armies of Occupa-tion.War Bonus onOfficers&apos; RetiiedPay.6. With reference to a decision of the Home Affairs Committee(20th Meeting, Minute 2) to reduce the rate of unemploymentbenefit from 29s. to 18s. for men, and from 25s. to 15s. for women,the Minister of Labour stated that he had, after consultation withthe Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law, agreed to a less drastic reduction of the men&apos;s scale, viz , to 20s. instead of lbs.The War Cabinet gave their approval to the revision.7. The War Cabinet took note of the following decisions of theSoldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee (Paper G.T.-6876) on the subjectof supplementation and other assistance to the Armies of Occupation: (a.) That the principle of supplementation would have tocontinue in the case of men retained to form the Armies ofOccupation.(b.) That the Minister of Pensions should undertake theadministration of supplementation.8. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Minister of Pensions (Paper G.T.-6894) containing proposals for: (1.) A war bonus on officers&apos; retired pay and on the pensions ofofficers&apos; relatives.(2.) A war bonus on the alternative pensions of men and men&apos;swidows.(3.) An   extension   of the   war  bonus  to  last   pay day  inSeptember 1919.Sir Auckland Geddes explained that this question had been referred to him as Chairman of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; pay committee with full powers of decision, but, in view of the IncomeTax concession that had just been made by the Chancellor of theExchequer, and in view of the present falling prices, he feltthat he could not agree to the proposals put forward by theMinister of Pensions. The latter had therefore felt it necessary tobring the matter before the War Cabinet for their decision.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had just madetwo big concessions to officers. In the first place, it had beencustomary to charge Income Tax on the gratuities given to officers on demobilisation. Owing to some legal point, however, it appeared that Income Tax could only be charged against temporary officers[826]-278 Cbenefit if they were persons employed in the establishment in whichthe dispute took place, whether or not they deliberately were taking part in it. The donation, however, was payable to workpeople inother establishments, who were thrown out of work as an indirectresult of a trade dispute.The Prime Minister said that, in the event of a strike, theGovernment would have to feed the whole community, and it was probable that the unemployment benefit would be paid in food insteadof in cash. It was desirable that some scheme should be worked outby which people received food on the presentation of a coupon.Arrangements would have to be made so that it would be possible,in the distribution of food, to differentiate between those men on strike, and persons out of work through no fault of their own.The War Cabinet decided That the Industrial Unrest Committee should consider a scheme by which, in the event of a strike, and the responsibilityfor feeding the community falling on the Government,coupons for food might be used in part or in whole paymentof the unemployment donation.
arid not against permanent officers, and he therefore proposed to ask parliament to relieve the gratuities of all officers from Income Tax.In the -second place, Income Tax was now charged on DisabilityPension. He took the view, however, that a disability pension should be regarded as compensation for injury in exactly the same way as the compensation granted under the Workmen^; Compensa-tion Act, and it was his intention to relieve disability pensions ofthis charge. The expenses entailed in the proposals of the Ministerof Pensions was considerable. It amounted, in the case of officersand nurses, to  107,000 for three months, and about a further 700,000 for the financial year 1919-20. Another point he wishedto pat forward was that he had been pressed to give a bonus on allCivil Service pensions, but these representations he had refused. Awar bonus could not logically be given on officers&apos; pensions on thegrounds of the high cost of living, unless the War Cabinet were also prepared to give a war bonus on the pensions of all government servants.The Minister of Pensions pointed out that his proposals askedfor a war bonus only on disability pensions. Further, the chiefargument for granting a war bonus was that, when a similar bonushad been granted on the pensions of all men, in November last,consideration of a war bonus on officers&apos; pensions had been deferred.Officers, he thought, should certainly be treated exactly in the same way as the men.Mr. Bonar Law said that no one realised better than he thedifficulties that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to contend with.At the same time, he thought that this concession would have to begranted, as questions were .certain to be raised in the House ofCommons on the matter, and it would not be possible to resist thedemand. Further, to his certain knowledge there was a great dealof distress amongst families of officers.Sir Charles Harris said that if the proposals of the Minister ofPensions were accepted, they would give rise to a great number ofanomalies. A considerable number of officers who would be retiringvoluntarily with a disability, would obtain a pension which was partly service and partly disability. The proposal to give a war bonuson the whole of this pension would, in his opinion, inevitably give riseto claims for bonus on pure service pension, especially when the officerhad ao far recovered as to be no longer eligible for disability pension.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the bonus should be given onlyon the disability element of a pension.The Minister of Pensions pointed out that this would entail agreat deal of extra administrative labour and would inevitablycause great delay in meeting officers&apos; claims. He was prepared,however, if that was the decision of the Cabinet, to accept Mr. bonar law&apos;s suggestion.Sir Charles Harris suggested that this could easily be done by giving the same bonus to an officer who had an element of service in his pension as to a temporary officer of the same rank and thesame degree of disability.Sir Auckland Geddes said that, in view of what the State was doing to bring down the prices of food and the cost of living gener-aliy, it did not seem necessary to grant this bonus. At the sametime, if it were given, he saw no logical grounds for refusing togrant a bonus on the pensions of all other Government servants.His objection, however, would be considerably reduced if it were decided to give the war bonus only on the disability element of apension.The First Lord said he was quite certain that very real hard-ships existed, particularly in the case of a great number of officers who had received their commissions from the ranks, and who found it increasingly difficult to retain the standard of living necessary totheir new positions.The War Cabinet, in coming to a decision, were influenced by
the fact that, although the concession could not be logically defendedon the grounds of the high cost of living, it would be very difficultto resist the demand put forward on sentimeutal grounds in theHouse of Commons, particularly in view of the fact that a war bonushad already been granted on men&apos;s pensions.The War Cabinet decided : To approve the recommendations of the Minister of Pensions(Paper G.T.-6894), subject to the limitation that the warbonus granted to an officer whose pension contained bothservice and disablement elements should be calculated uponthe retired pay which would be given to a temporaryofficer of the same rank and the same degree of disability.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,February 28, 1919.
