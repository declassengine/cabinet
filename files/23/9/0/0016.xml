Miners&apos;Claims: 1. The War Cabinet  had before them a joint memorandumSpokesman of by the Secretary of State f r Home Affairs, the President, of theGovernment in board of Trade, and the Minister of Labour (Paper G.T.-6745),Labour Disputes. upon the miners&apos; claims for an advance in wagi-s, a reduction inhours, &amp;c, and a note by the Acting Secretary of the War Cabinet(Paper G.T.-6750), with reference 10 the above memorandum.The President of the Board of Tra^e said that the positionbriefly was as follows : An application had been mnde by the Miners&apos;Federation-for an increased wage, and also to the Prime Ministerfor a 6-hours&apos; day and nationalisation of mines and minerals,which latter request had been referred to the Minister ofLabour, who had conferred with the Secretary of S* ate for Homeaffairs, himself, and (he Executive Committee of the Miners&apos;Federation, and they had agreed that it was desirable that these various questions should be settled at one and the same time.The miners were now awaiting a reply from the Coal controller and Sir Robert Horne&apos;s Committee. In reply to a question byMr. Bonar Law ;is to which Department should be responsible for negotiating with the Miners&apos; Federation, Sir Albert Stanley repliedthat, in his view, it should be the Ministry of Labour, but it waspossible that the Miners&apos; Federation might refuse to treat with that department.The Coal Controller said that a big question was involved.Hitherto, the Miners&apos; Federation had declined to deal with theMinistry of Labour, but tin re were indications that this attitude would not be maintained. Whatever decision was reached by theCabinet in regard to the Department deputed to deal wdth theminers, he trusted that that decision would be resolutely adhej ed to.The special position hitherto occupied by the latter was no longertenable.The Minister of Labour said that the miners had always claimeddirect access to the Prime Minister. This claim, in his view, should now be definitely rejected.Sir David Sh-mkleton pointed out that the reason this claim was advanced was that the Minister of Labour had, during the war,the power of enforcing compulsory arbitration, which had not been admitted by the miners. Now that that power was gone, it waspossible that they would change their minds.    1The Minister of Labour pointed out that so long as theGovernment controlled the mines, &amp;c, the position of his Depart-ment would be seriously compromised, as it would be regarded mthe light of an antagonist and not in that of conciliator. Thedecision which the Government was asked to take that day waswdiatwages were to be paid in the future, and how the price of coal shouldhe adjusted so as to enable any increase, if granted, to be met.The President of the Board of Trade, in reply to a question byMr. Bonar Law as to what would happen supposing that a 30 percent, increase were granted, said that the owners would accept this as the act of Government, and reminded the Cabinet that theGovernment had so far guaranteed the owners&apos; profits.Lord Curzon said that his view was that the Ministry ofLabour represented the Government in all labour questions. TheWar Cabinet or the Prime Minister might decide certain questions,but any preliminary enquiry must be made by that Ministry.He said he did not understand upon what ground the Miners&apos;Federation should object to negotiating with the Labour Ministry&apos;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during the warvarious Labour Sub-Departments had been formed in some of thechief Departments of State, viz., the Admiralty, the War Office, theBoard of Trade, and the Ministry of Munitions, and that theseSub-Departments had taken decisions so far as their own scopeextended. No Sub Department, however, was qualified to deal withso important a question as that now before the War Cabinet, which,in his view, must be handled by the Ministry of Labour
W$ 529Sir David Shackleton thought that somebody representing theemployers should, in the first instance, give a decision upon the wagequestion, and that if this were not satis&apos;satisfactory to the Miners&apos;Federation the latter body should approach the Ministry of Labour.Sir Adam Nimmo pointed out that the present application hadbeen made direct to the Government and not to the mine-owners.Sir David Shackleton suggested that it was for the Eoard ofTrade now to say if they agreed to the 30 per cent, advance, andthat if they were, unable to do so the matter should be referred tothe Ministry of Labour.The Coal Controller said in any case his own Department andthe Board of trade would necessarily render all assistance to theLabour Minister.The War Cabinet decided that -In all labour disputes the Minister of Labour, in close accordand touch with the Board of Trade, or other GovernmentDepartments involved, should act as the spokesman of theGovernment.Miners&apos; Claim for 2. The Minister of Labour said that the present demands of the advance in Wages    Miners&apos; Federation fell into&apos;three main categories :-and Reduction inHours, &amp;c. (a.) Demobilisation.(o.) Wages.(c.) Hours of labour.To which should be tacked on a general request for nationalisation of coal mines. Among the claims put forward by the Federationwere :  (i.) That all demobilised mine workers should be fully discharged from the Army and Navy, and reinstated in the minesas soon as they are able ;md desire to resume work.(ii.) Any such mine workers as are not able to perform an ordinary day&apos;s work; or are unable to get it; or aredisplaced to make room for discharged soldiers shall bepaid full miners&apos; wages.In regard to these demands, he proposed that the Govern-ment should take a clear stand. As regards demobilisationthere was no room for discussion. It was impossible to concedepreferential treatn ent to miners over the rest of the workers of thecountry. As a matter of fact iht-re had been less dislocation oflabour in the mines than elsewhere, except possibly in the shipyards.In regard to wages, the demand was for an additional 30 per cent.This would have a crippling effect on industry. The wage demand,alone would amount to about 40,000,0001. per annum; probably3s. 6d. to 4.s\ per ton would have to be added to tbe present priceof coal; and, incidentally, about 15s. per ton to be added to theprice of steel. In one respect, however, the miners had a reasonableclaim for consideration. Their last advance had been in June 1918,when the Prime Minister had promised them that their wages wouldbe reconsidered if the cost of living rose. Since then, increases of pay had been made to other trades. On the whole, looking at present -war conditions, in comparison with other trades, the miners hadnot suffered, but there was the Prime Ministers pledge to he considered, and in order to make them square with other industriesthey were perhaps entitled to receive an extra Is. per day.. Hesuggested that t vo alternative offers should be made to them :- -(i.) An increment of Is. a day.(ii.) That their claims should be examined by the Interim Courtof Arbitration which had succeeded the Committee on production.
What he proposed was that they should be ^empowered to offer the miners a full and impartial enquiry into the whole question oftheir wages. Such an offer to hear and investigate all their variouspleas could not fail, he thought, to have a favourable effect. Heventured to suggest the Committee of Enquiry might be composedsomewhat on the following lines : The head of a Government Department in the chair,Two representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation,Two representatives of the coaiowners,Two representatives of other trades,Two representatives of other trades unions,and, to complete the Committee,A prominent banker and a well-known economist.This Committee should also go into the question of hours. Theminers&apos; plea was that a reduction of the present hours would affordemployment to all miners who were being returned from the army.He himself did not apprehend any difficulty about their reinstate-ment in any case. He further suggested that the Committee should submit, as soon as possible, an Interim Report on the question ofwages and hours, and that it should then consider the further andwioer question of joint control, or the nationalisation of mines. Thecoaiowners themselves had asked for a full enquiry into the wholemechanism of the coal industry, and into the question of profits.Sir Adam Nimmo said he did nor object 10 the Terms ofReference to the Committee including the nationalisation of mines,but, speaking for the coahnasters, he could say that they would bemuch influenced as to this point by the character of the Committee,which must include men of undoubted experience and ability, as their enquiries would not be confined to the coal industry alone.He deprecated the Terms of Reference including too precise details,as he thought they should be covered by the general term&quot; organisation.&quot;Lord Curzon said that the Cabinet were now being asked todecide a very big question. The Committee&apos;s enquiries, to be com-plete, must e\tend over a period of four or five months. In themeantime, he understood that a Government decision about the nationalisation of mines would be postponed. If the Committeesenquiries were to extend to the question of the nationalisation of mines, the coalnrasters must he adequately represented thereon.Mr. Bonar Law doubted whether it was expedient that theCommittee appointed to investigate the question of hours and wages should also deal with the bigger problem of nationalisation. Thewhole matter required the movt careful handling, and it was essentialthat public opinion should be on the side of the Government. TheCommittee, besides comprising members who would represent boththe coalmasters and the miners, should also include others not directly interested in, or connected with, mines, e.g., judges andeconomists ; and, further, other members who would regard it fromthe point of view of other industries. He agreed with the Ministerof Labour that the proposed Committee should envisage the problem from the point of view of the general trade of the country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the objection tosetting up two separate Committees was that there would be two bodies simultaneously investigating coal problems. It was important that the Committee dealing with the nationalisation of mines should have the advantage of being in possession ofthe result of the enquiries of the committee on hours and wages. Lie suggested that a Committee should be set up to deal,in the first instance, with hours and wages, and that later its membership should be expanded in order to enable it to dealadequately with the larger question of nationalisation. He thought there was an unanswerable case for this suggested accretion to deal
with the larger matter, and he was sure that the miners would see thenecessity. He hoped that the Committee would also consider theeffect of nationalisation on our foreign trade. [ncidentally, hewould refer to a statement which had been made to the effect that increased cost, of living justified a further increase in pay. He would ask whether it was not possible now to do something to reduce theprice of food. There were at present enormous stocks in thiscountry, and he thought that the time had come to remove foodrestrictions.Sir Adam Nimmo thought that the Committee must include twoor three employers&apos; representatives, the same number of workers&apos;representaiives, and an equivalent number of consumers&apos;representa-tives. To these should be aided a certain number of members whowould exercise a balancing influence in order to knit the Committeetogether. He attached great importance to this balancing influence to enable all important interests in the country to be represented.His view was that the miners would prefer one Committee only, sothat the same members would deal with both problems.The Minister of Labour said that it must be made clear tothe miners that it was essential that, before the question of meeting their demands on the question of nationalisation couldbe properly considered, there must be a previous enquiry as to existing conditions. He would here remark that these presentclaims might only be regarded as an &quot;affair of outposts&quot;; the big battle would be joined later. Those responsible for the present industrial unrest ii&quot;w regarded, he believed, the recent sporadicoutbursts as a mistake. The moral he wotdd draw was that theGovernment must take immediate steps to develop their plans inorder to meet a much more serious situation later. As regards thepresent claims, a promise bad been made to the Miners&apos; Federationthat a reply would be oiven by the end of this week. He suggestedthat representatives of the Federation should be invited on thefollowing Monday to a conference, when the views of the Governmentshould be communicated to them. Were these views to be com-municated verbally or in a written statement? Toe advantage of4 verbal communication was that it would give a chance of theminers&apos; representatives making various suggestions, eg., in regardgo the Terms of Reference to the proposed Committee.The First Lord of the Admiralty, with reference to theChancellor of the Exchequers point in regard to reducing the priceof food, ^aid that this raised the question, in a more acute form, ofthe position of the producers in the country. He pointed out that wages had been raised during the war, not by competition, but by government action, and the new Parliament wuld be certain to wish to know how the interests of the producers were to be safeguarded.The Coal Controller said that the Minister of Labour mightbe&quot;correct in stating that the big battle was to come later, but hisown information, was to the effect that the miners in South Wales,at any rate, were out for a fight now.Mr: Bonar Law thought that possibly the present would be afavourable time for the Government to meet a strike. The essence of the present problem was, in his view, the case the Governmentwould be able to present to the country. The miners were claimingfco fix their own rates of pay, irrespective of the effect that this might have on other trades, and they were taking up a very selfishposition. He thought it most desirable that the Ministry of labour should at once carefully prepare their case for presentation to thepublic, and in doing so, they should make a strong point of theeffect of a rise in miners&apos; wages upon other wage-earners in the kingdom.Sir Adam Nimmo agreed that it was essential that a clear statement of the Governments position should be published allover the country    As regards the form in which the views of the[826J-190 C
Government should be communicated to the miners&apos; representatives,he feared that a verbal statement alone would only result in hopelessmisunderstanding and confusion. He suggested that the verbalmessage should be at once followed by a printed memorandum to beplaced in the hands of the delegates, and to be widely publishedimmediately after the conference.Sir David Shackleton hoped that the communication would notbe in too cit-and-dvied a form and elastic rather than rigid.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Labour should prepare, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary, adraft communication to be made by him to the represents-fives of the Miners&apos; Federation on the following Monday, thesaid draft to be submitted to Mr. Benar Law for the approvalof the Prime Minister before being communicated to theminers&apos; representatives ; and the communication, as finally approved, to be widely circulated immediately after theconference.Industrial TJnrest: 3. With reference to War Cabinet 528, Minute 1, the PresidentTube Strike. of the Board of Trade r. ported  that the drivers on the TubeThreatened London Railways had not accQpted the Governments offer, and consequentlyElectrical Strike. bad not returned to work. On the railways, with one exception (asapart from the Tube Railways , the normal services were being-resumed. Mr. Bromley, the Secretary to the Associated Society of engineers and Firemen, was trying to induce his men to resumework, but a difficulty had arisen with the drivers in the NationalUnion of Bailwaymen, who were the hey of the position. their executive on the previous day bad repudiated Mr. H ndson&apos;s signatureto the agreement. The Executive bad telephoned late last nightthat negotiations would still continue. The men, however, were very dissatisfied with the result of the Governments decision. Inview of the fact that negotiations were proceeding, that a criticalstage had been reached, that we were bringing outside men into thepower-stations, and that the present strike was quite unauthorised,he suggested that it would bo better to wait before bringing meninto the Lots Road power-station. The Government view had beeaput before the men, and we had maintained the principle for whichwe had fought. He suggested that we should wait for theExecutive&apos;s reply, and if it were not satisfactory, we should go ahead and use all means in our power to break: the strike.Mr. Bonar Law agreed that, if the strike went on it would benecessary for the Government to take a strong line and see thematter through.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs asked if Sir hamar greenwood&apos;s Committee should continue its preparations to carryon the public services should the strike continue.The President of the Board of Trade said he had asked Mr. Blainto find out definitely, in the event of the Lots Load power station beingclosed down, if there would be a sufficient number of volunteersfrom outside to carry on the services, and he understood that asufficient number of men would be forthcoming.Sir Hamar Greenwood said that arrangements had been madethe previous night to take over every electric light station. Therewould be that evening 1,000 extra skilled mechanics ready to takeover the lighting stations. No definite information was yet forth-coming as to what the strikers had act ually decided the previous day. His Committee, however, proposed in . the meantime tocontinue their preparations. .       .The Minister of Labour suggested that the Government oughtto make definite plans for establishing a permanent organisation to- meet civil emergencies in the future.
Mr. Bonar Law had agreed that this should be done, and suggested that Sir Hamar Greenwood&apos;s Committee should carry out this proposal.Sir Hamar Greenwood said that his Committee had registeredthe names and addresses of large numbers of outside skilled menwho would form the n iclei of an organisition sue i as that suggestedby the Minister of Labour. According to his information, tbe menin the electrical power plants were generally averse from striking,but they and their families had been intimidated by tbe revolutionaryelements.The War Cabinet decided  (a.) To sanction the establishment of a permanent organisation as suggested bv Sir Hamar Greenwood;DO ji ill *(6.) To express to Sir Ha mar Greenwood and his Committeetbe thanks of the Government for the admirable workthey had performed.At a later stage the President of the Board of Trade read aletter which he had receive 1 from the Executive of the NationalUnion of Railwaymen asking for a conference, and stated that hewas arranging to see them at 3 o&apos;clock that afternoon.Desirability of publishing theOriginal Agreementwith the Pail wayMen on the Eight-Hours&apos; Question.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to recent articles in the &quot;Times&quot; and other newspapers which suggested the agree-ment signed by Mr. Bromley was not in the same terras as the onesigned by Mr. Unison on the eight-hours&apos; question.The War Cabinet decide 1 that  The President of the Board of Trade shouldwas identically the same agreement.announcethatitLocal Investigating 5, The Minister of Labour suggested that it was desirable thattCommissions. the Local Commissions formed in 1916 to investigate the conditionswhich led to industrial unrest during the war should be re-established,as the said Commissions had undoubtedly performed admirable work.It was particularly necessary at tbe present juncture that thereshould be responsible local bodies who should examine and report on local grievances. Tbe special question demanding a solution waswhy there was so much revolt against the authority of the TradeUnions. In this connection he bad obtained the view7s ofMr. Clynes, Sir Allan Smith, and others, who had ail expressedthemselves in favour of&quot; establishing the.Local Commissions.The War Cabinet decided that -The  Minister of Labour should submit definite proposals fortheir consideration.The Goal Situation. (i- The Coal Controller said that there were two points in regardto which he desired to consult the War Cabinet. The first was, inthe event of the miners &quot; downing tools,&quot; could tbe coulmasters rely upon tbe Government affording adequate protection to their mines ?and, secondly, should Allied and neutral Governments be informed,in view of the possibility of a strike on the part of the coal-minersof the United Kingdom, that they would be well advised to take thenecessary steps to place advance orders for coal in the United Statesand elsewhere ?The WuT Cabinet decided that (a) The Coal Controller should refer the matter of protection tothe Committee on Industrial Unrest (War Cabinet 525,Minute 3).[626]-190 D
(b.) it was undesirable tbat any representations should be madeto Allitd and. neutral countries at this stage.Seditious Speeches. 7. The War Cabinet considered   &apos;ed a Memorandum bv the HomeSecretary (Paper G.T.-G755) on the question of prosecuting seditiousspeakers.The florae Secretary said that, up to the present time, the HomeOffice had been of the opinion that to prosecute for seditiousspeeches made at small anarchists&apos; meetings did more harm than good. It was felt, however, that the situation hac now changed.There were Bol-heviks in the country with German money, and bewas of 01 inion that, in the diff rent circumstances, it would be wise to proseeute for seditious speeches. He pointed out that the leadersof the agitation in Glasgew had been prosecuted, and he had beenprepared, had it been necessarv, to arrest those responsible for the unrest amongst the eL ctrical engineers. The alien violinist, Soermus,who bad been going al out the country making violent speeches, had also been arrested. The Home Office had fairly reliable information about two Swedes who had come into this country with Germanmoney. He thought that if seme persons of this di scription were arrested, and at the same time a few men of the type of Davidllamsey, whose spt eches were referred to in his Memorandum, itwould do a great deal to show the country the kind of men whowere making mischief. He would single out the most influential andprominent for prosecution.Mr Bonar Law said that he took the same view as the HomeSecretary. In ordinary times prosecutions did more harm than good,but the present circumstances were exceptional. Anything thatwould impress public opinion with the revolutionary nature of thepresent agitation would be an advantage. He hoped the HomeOffice in ended to deal with men of the type of McManus. Theyshould endeavour to get at the real leaders of tin- movement.Mr. Chamberlain hop. d that the Home Office would take care,when selecting expressions of opinion on which to prosecute, to eliminate those w..ich were less strongly worded. He felt that ifattention were confined to only half of the objectionable passages,the strongest half being selected, it would have more effect on public opinion.It was suggested that the Government should aim at prose-cuting persons who were not directly associated with the TradeUnions.The First Lord pointed out that it was desirable to get at thosewho were carrying on an agitation under the guise of TradesUnionism. He was informed by the naval authorities that thesailors, while they were extraordinarily loyal, and had expressed their willingness to help in the prevention of disorder,.could not understand why agitators, to whose speeches they listened whenon shore-leave, were allowed to sav things which no man would be permitted to say on board ship.Sir Auckland Geddes suggested that power should be taken to prosecute aliens coming to this country and indulging in propa-ganda, and would even go the length of taking power to inflictthe death sentence. During the Election the country was veryexcited on the subject of aliens. He suggested that a sharp dis-tinction should be drawn between British subjects and aliens.The Home Secretary agreed, but pointed out the legal difficulty,that so many who were aliens by t arentage and upbringing hadbeen born on British soil and were British subjects.The Secretary for Scotland said he was sure that the lord advocate was in agreement with the proposal contained in theHome Secretary^ Memorandum so far as it concerned Scotland. he strongly expressed the hope, however, that if convictions were obtained, the Government would not allow prisoners to be released
before they bad served their sentences.   The release of MaciLean.had had unfortunate results.   MacLean was again making mostoutrageous speeches, and would probably ha,ve to be rearrested.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the recommendations contained in the HomeSecretary&apos;s Memorandum;(h.) To request the Home Secretary to draw up proposals onthe   lines   suggested   by   Sir   Auckland   Geddes,   forconsideration by the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 7, 3919.
