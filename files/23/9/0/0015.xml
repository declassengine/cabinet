Industrial Unrest: (l) With reference to War Cabinet 527, Minute 1, Mr. BonarTube Strike. Law stated that the President of the Board of Trade had informed him that the Railway Executive had drawn, up a proposal withregard to the eight-hour day dispute with the Underground driversto which the men had expressed themselves willing to agree. Thisproposal was as follows : &quot; The Underground motormen to be booked on for eitdithours work. The Company to arrange the work so as to affordtime within tbe eight hours to meet the reasonable necessities ofthe men.This proposal,   if  accepted,  would  cover the  interim  period between now and 12th February, when tbe Railway Executive met- . the two railway men&apos;s Unions for further negotiation.   This formula,although not giving anything away in effect, did so in appearance,B and it was important, in the present disturbed state of the country,that the Government should give no justification for the suggestionthat it was yielding to the strikers. The Underground drivers were now willing to accept the substance of what the Government hadbeen fighting for, and they were being afforded the same conditionsas to meals as tbe drivers of the steam trains.The Minister of Labour said that he had seen the representativesof the men during the day, and was convinced that there had been an honest misapprehension with regard to the interpretation of theAgreements of 6th December and 30th January. He had seen themen&apos;s Rules, which described the nine-hour day as a &quot; nine-hourworking day,&quot; although half an hour had been taken off for meals.On the steam railways the driver stopped his engine, or otherwisearranged to take time during the eight hours for a meal, and thiswas reckoned as working time, and paid for. The Undergrounddrivers thought that they were in an analogous position, and this was how the misunderstanding bad arisen. He felt that the Governmentwould be in a very serious position if they now rejected the present proposal. The Cabinet should keep in view the fact that theAgreement to which the Government was pledged was not theoriginal Agreement of the 6th December. It omitted the word&quot;working&quot; before &quot;eight hours,&quot; and its second clause contained the words &quot; All existing conditions of service to remain unaltered,pending the decision of a Committee to be set up as soon as possibleto review wages and other conditions of service of railway men inGreat Britain.&quot; Mr. Bromley, of the Associated Society of Loco-\motive Engineers and Firemen, was willing to have the conditionsreviewed on the 12th February, but wanted to hold the Governmentto tbe Agreement of the 30th January, which laid down an eight-hour working day, and provided that &quot; all aiher conditions of service should remain unaltered.&quot; If the issue were raised, the public were certain to lay the greater stress on the original Agreement.Mr. Bonar Law said that this did not get over the present difficulty. There had been doubt as to the interpretation of theoriginal Agreement, but it had been cleared up on tbe 30th January.What the Cabinet had intended to resist had been deductions ofmeal time of from 30 minutes upwards from the eight hours. Theyhad not contested that the men should have time for a &quot; snack &quot;&apos; after the manner of the steam locomotive drivers. The Cabinet hadreally been placed in a false position.Sir Robert Horne said that the National Union had repudiatedMr. Hudson&apos;s signature to the Agreement of the 30th January. only  per cent, of the railwaymen were affected by the present proposal,and the Unions maintained that they were only fighting the case ofthose who found it difficult to get &amp; &quot;snack&quot; within the eight hours.They did not make any general claim for all railwaymen.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in comparing theconditions of the Underground drivers with the steam locomotive
drivers, the many disadvantages of the latter ought to be borne in mind.If i lie present proposal were accepted, it would only camouflage adefeat for the Government. In his opinion the extremists were beginning to realise that, by the firm action of the Government, theywere beat h, ard he therefore strongly advocatsd that the Govern-ment should not accept the Agreement now suggested.The Secretary of State for War said that, at a time when every-pne should be working harder to make up for the waste of war, itwas monstrous that men should be demanding what was in reality aseven and a half-hours&apos; day. An eight-hours&apos; working day was not too much for any man, and he failed to see how the wealth of thecountry could be made up if interpretations such as that now pro-posed were put upon an Agreement which had laid down an eight-hours&apos; working day. On the other hand, the whole principle of allowing men to take their meals during working hours; was anobjectionable one, and it was not surprising that the whole of therailways were seething with discontent. These Underground men should have special places provided for them by the Companies, inwhich they could eat their meals in comfort, and proper intervals forsuch meals outside the working-dav should be arranged.&apos; It wotddbe useful if the Government put some conditions of this kind into theAgreements with the Companies and the men.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that the customof taking meals (luring working time was a verv old one on therailways, and could riot well be disturbed.Tin; Postmaster-General said that he was in favour of fighting the battle right through. If any concession were made now, itwould otilvbe the prelude to further lightning, strikes, more especiallyin tin&apos; Postal Services.Mr. Bonar Law asked Sir Herbert Walker (who had justentered) how he could justify the compromise proposed by theRailway Executive, in view of bis (Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s) correspondence with Mr. Bromley.Sir Herbert Walker replied that the meal time within the eight hours had not been conceded, and the Railway Executive didnot propose to concede it. The rime it was now proposed to allowoil was not a meal time, would not be recognised as such, and would no&apos; he &quot;&quot; hooked off.&apos;&apos; The understanding was that some ten minuteswould be taken off. He admitted that they were skating over thinice. Unless this was accepted, the strike would certainly extendover the Firemeifs Union, and possibly over the National Union of railwaymen.The First Lord and the Secretary of State for War concurred in the opinion that it was hardly possible to have a moreunsat satisfactory arrangement.Mr. Bonar Law said that the Government were on weakerground than was originally thought, and had the facts as now presented been before them at an earlier stage, they would not havechosen the present ground on which to fight, especially since theRailway Executive were prepared to accept the formula set out above.Lord (lurzon said the position was extremely regrettable, and,if the Government yielded, their position in relation to the electricalstrike would be adversely affected.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was of opinion that the pro-posed arrangement did not in fact give away the principle for whichthe Government had contended, viz., an eight-hours working day.The men were not now claiming meal time, but only necessary facilities for their physical requirements. But the proposed formula,must be altered to make this clear. He suggested a form of wordsfor this purpose.The President of the Board of Trade said it was important forthe Cabinet to direct their minds to the negotiations which would open on the 12th February.    The Underground drivers were now[826]-159 B 2
only asking for what had been concede!I to tlie steam drivers, and bethought the Cabinet could fairly agree, without prejudice to theattitude which it wouid have to take up if, later on, an hour formeals was demanded within the eight-hour day.After considerable discussion, the following amended formula wasdratted, and the President of the Board of Trade was requested tonegotiate with the representatives of the men with a view to its acceptance : &quot; The Underground trainmen to be booked on for eight hours&apos; work. Meal time will net be included in the eight hours,but in the new conditions of the eightdmur day the companies will offer all reasonable facilities to meet the ordinary physicalneeds of the men.&quot;Threatened 2. With reference to War cabinet 527, Minute 1, the Secretaryj^a of State for Home Affairs informed the Cabinet that, should the electrical strike materialise, arrangements had been made to keepthe power stations going with but little reduction in the supply ofelectricity. Plis information, however, was to the effect that ifthe strike occurred, it would probably be only partial. Steps had also been taken, in the event of a strike, to arrest three or four ofthe leaders under the new Defence of the Realm Act Regulationpassed by Order in Council on the previous day. There were severalcharges which could be made against these men. Naval stokerswere available to start work at Lots Load Power Station as soon asthey were required, and it was hoped that a restricted service wouldbe started on the Central London railway on the following morning,and on the District Railway on the following afternoon.The Under-Secretary of State for the Ro\al Air Force said that700 Royal Air Force men were arriving in London that evening, 400of whom were eleciricians. He had received numerous offers of help from Royal Air Force officers with technical knowledge.The Secretary of State for War said that satisfactory reports had been received regarding the attitude of the Air Force electricians.Lorry Situation. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 527, Minute 1, the Secretaryof State for Home Affairs said that a section of the &apos;bus drivers atBattersea had threatened to strike. Their Executive, however, had told them to continue at work, but the men were holding a meetingat 1.1 o&apos;clock that night to decide upon, their action. The executive had informed Mr. Blain, the General Manager of the London GeneralOmnibus Company, that, if a regular service of lorries was run, therewas no doubt that the men would come out, but it was not thoughtthat they would take exception to a restricted lorry service for thepurpose of assisting Government employees. Another considerationwi,th regard to the &apos;bus men had to be remembered, which was, thatif they heard that the leaders in the electrical strike had been arrested this might cause the &apos;bus men to come out.The Quartermaster-General stated that 289 lorries were nowrunning for the use of Government employees, and that it would bepossible to put on a further 500 by the following morning, andanother 500 by the followdng evening.It was suggested that a number of vehicles could be obtainedfrom the Road Pjoard.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should place on the roads on thefollowing morning, and during the day, all the availablei lorries he could obtain.

The War Cabinet decided Industa-ial Unre^tF To authorise the expenditure by the Minister of Labour of such sums as might be necessary to defray the cost of propagandaby his Department during the present industrial unrest.Pay of the Police. 5. With reference to AVar Cabinet o24, Minu Secretaryof State for Home Affairs said that, as directed by the War Cabinet,he had drawn up the following Terms of Reference to the proposed committee on the pay  of the Police : &quot; To consider and report on whether any or what changes should he made in the method of recruiting for. the conditionsof service of. and the rates of pay, pensions and allowances of,the Police Forces of England, Scotland and Ireland/&apos;The War Cabinet approved the above Terms of Preference.(Initialled) A.
