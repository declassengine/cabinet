2Strike Situation in Mr. Bonar Law stated that the following telegram had beenGlasgow. addressed that morning by the Lord Provost of Glasgow to thePrime Minister with regard to the labour situation in Glasgow : &quot; I have been waited upon by a deputation appointed bya largely attended meeting of those who are dissatisfied withthe present working conditions, and which was held in front ofthe City Chambers. The deputation consisted of elevenmembers, including Messrs. Shinwell, Kirkwood, and Maclean,M.P. for Govan, and they requested me to represent to thePrime Minister and also to the Minister of Labour that they wished the Government to intervene with the employers inorder to secure a reduction of the working hours to forty perweek without any reduction in wages, so as to provide for those who had been demobilised and are without employment.It was further stated that they had hitherto adopted constitu-tional methods in urging their demand, but that, failingconsideration being given to then request by the Government,they would adopt any other methods which they might considerwould be likely to advance their cause. They have, however,agreed to delay taking any such action until Friday in orderthat I may be able to communicate your reply. I have justlearned from the manager of the electricity department that allthe men in the generating stations have been compelled to-day to join the strike, and that only sufficient men will be allowedto run the plant necessary to provide lighting and power for hospitals and infirmaries and possibly lighting of privatedwelling-houses.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law said that he had seen the Minister of Labour,and had prepared with him a draft reply to the above asfollows : &quot; Your telegram has come to me in the absence of thePrime Minister, whose presence in Paris is necessary in theinterest of the nation.&quot; The question of working hours, which forms the subjectof the representations forwarded by you, is the precise questionwhich is being dealt with at the present time between theemployers and the duly elected representatives of the trades union chiefly concerned, in these circumstances, the Govern-ment are unable to entertain requests for intervention made bylocal members of Unions whose representatives are acting forthem in conference with the employers. Such action on thepart of the Government could only undermine the authority ofthose who have been chosen by the men to represent them, andwould destroy the co-operation between employers and employedon which the hope of industrial peace depends.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law said that he had spoken to the Prime minister on the telephone, who had expressed his approval of the above tele-gram, and thought that it was the right course for the Governmentto take. The Prime Minister said that if it were necessary he would come to London, but he was of the opinion that his coming wouldhave the appearance of interfering with Sir Robert Horne&apos;authority.Sir Robert Home suggested that a sentence might be inter-polated in the telegram to the Lord Provost informing him of thenegotiations that had taken place between employers and workmen.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out, however, that the object of the telegram was not to influence the Lord Provost, but to show thepublic that the Government did not mean to intervene. Some other means of communication should be found to bring Sir R. Horne&apos;spoint before the public.
Sir Eric Geddes said that, as he understood the position, theobject of the reply to the Lord Provost was to reinforce theauthority of the Trades Unions, &quot;and he was in sympathy with this.He would like to know, however, whether we were quite safe on the merits of the case as between employers and employed.Sir Robert Home explained that an agreement had alreadybeen arrived at between the employers and employed in the ship-building and engineering trades with regard to the 47-hour week, but there was a dispute about the application of the detains to the agreement. The present strike in Glasgow, however, was for a 40-hour week, and in Belfast for a 44-hour week, which was in contravention of the agreement reached by the accredited represen-tatives of the masters and men.Mr. Bonar Law said that he thought it vital for the WarCabinet to be satisfied that there was a sufficient force in Glasgowto prevent disorder and to protect those volunteers or others who could be made available to takeover the operation of the generating stations and municipal services. It was certain that if the movementin Glasgow grew, it would spread all over the country.Mr. Munro said that there were two questions to be decided (1.) What was the programme of the Government ?(2.) If the Government was agreed on a programme, who should put it into operation ?As regards taking over the electricity and municipal servicesof the city, ho suggested that the special constables, of whom therewere 2,000 in Glasgow, might be more reliable and suitable thansoldiers. lie assumed thai there would be persons who could befound to supervise and direct them. Then there was the separateproblem of guarding those who carried out this work. The police force in Glasgow had been much depletetl during the war, and.it wasnecessary to get back the 500 men who were now in the forces atthe earliest possible moment, and hi- suggested that instructions tothis effect should be issued at once.Mr. Churchill said it would be impossible to pick out of thevast numbers who were being demobilised each day the 500constables referred to by the Secretary for Scotland.Mr. Munro offered no opinion on the problem of demobilisation,but stated that he felt bound to lay this request made to him by the sheriff before the Cabinet. Continuing, he said that there vtis thequestion as to who should take the initiative. The Lord Provostand the Sheriff were jointly responsible for law and order in the city.He suggested, however, that Sir Thomas Munro, who had hadunrivalled experience with regard to labour conditions in Scotland,might be attached to the Lord Provost and the Sheriff in a purelyadvisory capacity, or that, in any event, his services should be utilised to convey to them the views of the Government. In pointof fact he was going north the same night.Mr. Chamberlain said that he thought it would be a great mistake to involve the Ministry of Labour in the responsibility forpreserving law and order, and the appointment of Sir Thomas Munroto the position suggested might give this impression.General Sir William Robertson stated that General McCrackenwas iu command of the troops in Scotland. The military part of thequestion was quite simple The civil authorities were responsiblefor law and order, and the military could not step in except at theirrequisition iu accordance -with King&apos;s Regulations. This did notapply, however, if martial law- were declared. There were inScotland 19 infantry battalions, which were, all Scottish but one.One of these battalions was in Glasgow, one at Greenock, and about12 in the vicinity of Edinburgh. They were all reserve-findingunits, and consisted of all sorts of men, old, young, convalescents,and men with wounds. As regards the officers, these were not veryefficient. He drew the Cabinet&apos;s attention to this in view of the[8261-109 B i,
purposes for which the troops might be used. It would not be legalto use soldiers for taking over and running the generating stations.It was pointed out that, during one of the big railway strikes inpeace time, a few soldiers had been employed as engine-drivers andguards.General Childs said that this was true ; a few men had been so employed, but at that time we had a well-disciplined and ignorantarmy, whereas now we had an army educated and ill-disciplined.Sir William Robertson continuing said that there were certaindisadvantages in employing Scottish troops, but on the whole hethought it would be safer to use them than to import Englishbattalions.Mr. Churchill said that we should not exaggerate the serious-ness of this disturbance. In times of- peace we had had to go through strikes just as dangerous as this one. There had been astrike at Liverpool in which riots and loss of life had occurred, andthis condition of affairs had continued for six weeks, after which asettlement was reached. The present situation in Glasgow hadbeen brewing for a long time. The disaffected were in a minority,and, in his opinion, there would have to be a conflict in order to clear the air. We shotdd be careful to have plenty of provocationbefore taking strong measures. By going gently at first we should get the support we wanted from the nation, and then troops couldbe used more effectively. The moment for their use had not yetazrived. In the meantime the Defence of the Realm Act was still inforce, and some of the leaders of ti e revolt should be seized.Mr. Bonar Law said he did not disagree with a word Mr.Churchill had said. He was only anxious that there should be someresponsible person, in Glasgow ready to call in the military when necessary, and this person should be told that the military hadreceived orders to hold themselves in readiness. Steps shouldalso be taken to get the Special Constabulary ready. He wouldlike to know: in what way Sir &apos; Robert Horne suggested theGovernment could keep in touch with the Lord Provost and the sheriff.Sir Robert Horne said that he proposed to send to Glasgowa representative of the Ministry of Labour, and again suggestedSir Thomas Munro might act in this capacity, and keep the Ministryof Labour informed as to the situation. He did uot, however, wantSir Thomas Munro to have any responsibility for the direction ofaffairs.Mr. Chamberlain said that it was important not to move inadvance of public opinion. His recollection of pre-war strikes wasthat the really effective intimidation was done not at the workshops,but at the workmen&apos;s homes. Here we had an insubordinateminority dragging the majority with them. The duration of thestrike depended largely on the amount of effective protection whichcould be given to those who were unwilling participants, and to theGovernments success in counteracting the terrorism of the minority.JVJr Bonar Law pointed out that such pre-war strikes weresanctioned by a Trade Union, and strike pay was being granted.The present position was different, and intimidation at the homesof the people had not. shown itself.In reply to a question as to whether the police in Glasgow wereto be trusted, Mr. Munro replied, on. the authority of the chief constable, in the affirmative. There had been a little troublea week or two ago when they had demanded an increase of pay.This increase Mr. Munro had granted, on the recommendation ofthe municipal authorities.It was suggested that someone could be sent to Glasgow tokeep the Government closely informed of the course of events, andMr. Munro said that he could send the Assistant Under-Secretary ofthe Scottish Office, Mr. John Lamb, in whom he had the fullestconfidence.
Mr. Bonar Law said that Mr. John Lamb should get in touchwith the Lord Provost of Glasgow and the Sheriff. The firstresponsibility in the whole matter must be taken by the Secretaryfor Scotland, and he thought Mr. John Lamb should tell the LordProvost that the Government&apos;? view was that the situation shouldbe dealt with patiently but firmly, and the military only called inwhen asked for in order to prevent serious disorder and intimidation,and to preserve the lighting arrangements of the city.Sir Robert Home said that he would like to suggest to theSecretary for Scotland that if there were any possibility of seizing theleaders during the strike they should do so. These leaders were notrepresentatives of the Trades Unions at all, and most of them were well-known extremists.The Lord Advocate undertook to consider this suggestion.Mr. Churchill said that before taking any action in dealingwith the strikers we should wait until some glaring excess hadbeen committed. The moment the revolt advanced over the line ofa pure wage dispute, and the strikers were guilty of serious breach of the law, then was the moment to act.Mr. Munro suggested that we were very near that stage now,and stated that threats had been made to wreck the newspaperoffices in Glasgow.Sir Eric Geddes drew attention to the fact that the President ofthe Board of Trade anticipated that the railways might shut down on Saturday, as the men wrere threatening to work only eight hours.This would inevitably disorganise all railway traffic. This might affect the movement of troojjs into Glasgow.Mr. Churchill said that the .\Var Office would take all thenecessary steps to meet such eventuality, and would considerarrangements for placing troops in the vicinity of Glasgow.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the telegram drafted by Mr. Bonar haw andSir Robert Home in reply to the Lord Provost ofGlasgow.(b.) That the Secretary for Scotland should inform the LordProvost and the Sheriff of Lanarkshire that, in the viewof the Government, the lighting of the city must bekept up if there is any possibility of doing it; that themilitary will be in readiness to give their services whenrequested by the civil authorities ; and that firm, but notprovocative action should be taken to put down disorderand prevent intimidation.(c.) That Mr. John Lamb should proceed to Glasgow that evening in order to acquaint the Lord Provost and the sheriff of the Governments policy, and to keep theGovernment informed of any development in thesituation.(r/.) That the following Committee should be set up forpurposes of consultation during the continuance of disorder :  The Secretary for Scotland (Chairman).The Lord advocate the Minister of Labour.The Director of Personal Services (War Office).(e.) That the Lord Advocate should examine the legal grounds for the arrest of the ringleaders of the strike, should itbe found desirable to do so.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,January 30, 1919.
