onstantinople. 1. In reply to an enquiry, Lord Curzon gave the War Cabinetsome details as to the position in Constantinople. He said thatConstantinople was in the military command of General Milne,who was responsible for the order of the city, but that he wassubordinate to General Franchet d&apos;Esperey. General Milne wouldpresently be going to Batum, Baku, and Transcaspia, in order toreport on the situation there, which was not very satisfactory,owing to the clangers of Bolshevik aggression. The War office had reported the unsatisfactory conditions in Constantinople, wherethere was great insecurity and disorder, and where the Turks wereevading the armistice terms in every possible way. The WarOffice would like us to exercise a far more stringent military control over the city. It appeared sufficient, however, to assumecharge of the police and sanitary administration, especially since it appeared that General Franchet d&apos;Esperey might do this himselfwhen he arrived on the scene. But it was beyond our rights,without Allied assent, to assume complete military control overConstantinople. A telegram, however, had been sent on the11th January to the effect that Generel Milne should assumeexecutive control of the police and sanitation, as a corollary to our military occupation, and should inform General Franchet d&apos;Esperey. to this effect. This apparently had given rise to the opinion thatwe were going to occupy it militarily on a large scale, and admiral calthorpe had wired asking if this was so, and had we our Allies&apos;consent.The Director of Military Intelligence said that he understood the Foreign Office had telegraphed full particulars to admiral calthorpe, but the latter had apparently not yet received them,although he had had the wire from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mediterranean. A copy of the telegram sent to general milne had now been sent by the Foreign Office to Admiral Calthorpe(No. 88, dated the 14th January, 1919), to whom Lord Curzonundertook, on behalf of the Foreign Office, still further to explain the matter.Lord Curzon said that he had seen at the Foreign Office areport on the condition of prisoners at Constantinople, which wasone of the most disgraceful stories of barbarity and incompetencehe had ever read ; although he thought it did not refer to our prisoners, who had left, but to people who had been thrown intoprison by the Turkish authorities, very often without any crimesbeing alleged. He thought it would not be unreasonable to includethe prisons in the sanitarj&apos; control of the city.Mr. Barnes agreed that we should do so, subject to the con-currence of the French Government.Lord CurzOn, in reply to a question by Mr. Barnes, said thatthe reports in regard to Enver were very conflicting. He was reported at one time to be in Morocco, at another in Berlin, and afew weeks ago he was supposed to be making for Azerbaijan.Admiral Calthorpe had telegraphed asking for authority, withoutthe consent of the Turkish Government, to arrest Enver, Talaat, andtheir leading confederates, if he could do so. He (Lord Curzon)had replied, giving the necessary authority. He thought that admiral Calthorpe would hardly have asked for it unless therewas information that Enver was somewhere near The   War Cabinet concurred in the action taken by lord curzon.Siberia. 2. With reference to War Cabinet 515, Minute 7, the Directorof Military Intelligence said that the two British battalions in Siberiahad now arrived at Omsk, and were perfectly safe. The operationswest of the Urals had been going very well. Perm had been captured by the Siberian troops, and the Third Bolshevik Army hadbeen completely annihilated.
Horth Russia.Murmansk and theBaltic Provinces.Russian Prisonersof War4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby Lord Curzon (Paper G.T.-6644) and a note by Marshal Foch(Paper G.T.-6650) containing proposals for - dealing with thequestion of Russian prisoners in enemy territories.Lord Curzon said it was no longer necessary to trouble theWar Cabinet with this matter, since the whole question hingedupon, first, our policy towards the Bolsheviks ; secondly, the pro-vision of relief. Both of these questions were being considered in Paris at present. At the meeting in Paris on Sunday,January 12, 1919, the subject had been brought up, and marshal foch&apos;s proposals were agreed to.The War Cabinet took note of the fact that Marshal Foch&apos;sproposals, as set out in Paper G.T.-6650, had beenagreed to by the Associated Governments at Paris onJanuary 12, 1919, and that Marshal Foch had been askedto formulate a proposition stating to what parts of Russiahe proposed that Prussians should be sent. (paper i.C.-103, Minute 5 )Awards to. 5. The War Cabinet had before them a note by Mr. Bonar Law,Inventors. covering a report of a  Departmental Committee on Awards toInventors (Paper G.T.-6500), together with a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-6629) on the same subject.Mr. Chamberlain said that he understood that all departments were agreed on this question, and, as far as the Treasury was con-cerned, he was prepared to concur in the recommendations made bythe Departmental Committee.Mr. Barnes said that he thought it would give great satisfactionif one of the two Members of Parliament on the Commission was a labour Member. Labour felt at the moment that their point ofview was not well represented as regards inventions.The War Cabinet decided 1 To approve of the Report of the Departmental Committee, and requested the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take thenecessary action with regard to the setting up of the RoyalCommission.The Chancellor was also requested to take note of the sugges-&apos;    ,      - tion with regard to the representation of labour.[826-51]3. The Director of Military Intelligence explained that thesituation in Murmansk was unchanged. The situation in Esthoniawas not satisfactory.Lord Curzon gave an account of the position in the baltic provinces. At Reval there were the elements of an EsthonianGovernment, which included people of good local repute but with little experience in governing a country. They were holding theirowiii and were supported by 400 or 500 Finnish troops, but theposition was precarious. At Riga the conditions were worse.Since our withdrawal there was no means of defending the townfrom the Bolsheviks, who were in possession. At Libau conditions were somewhat the same as at Riga, although it had not yet fallen to the Bolsheviks. Our only way of helping was by some sort of armed intervention, but the whole of this question was being con-sidered in Paris at the present moment.
Government 6. With, reference to War Cabinet 515, Minute 15, the WarFkx Gro 0f 1919      Cabinet had before them a memorandum by Mr. Shortt (Paperax  roP&apos; G.T.-6570) relating to tbe purchase by the Government of the 1919flax crop.Mr. Shortt said that the matter was one of considerable urgency,inasmuch as unless the farmers were guaranteed a price for thisyears crop they would use the land for purposes other than growing-flax.Mr. Chamberlain said that he very much doubted the desirabilityof guaranteeing the price of this crop. He could not understandhow it was that, with flax in high demand and certain of a goodprice, no one would grow it without a Government guarantee. If aguarantee was necessary in order to induce the farmers to growflax, why should it not be given by the linen manufacturers ? Theguarantee was, in effect, a subsidy to the linen industry. If theGovernment undertook to guarantee a high purchase price of thiskind they would have no security that they would be able to market the flax, and if flax came from Russia the manufacturerwould be at perfect liberty to purchase from Russia at a lower price.Lord Colwyn said that, according to the experts in Ireland,there was little chance of any reduction in the price of flax. If theGovernment did not help as suggested, it would mean that a great mass of labour would be thrown out of work. As a business proposi-tion he would not recommend the undertaking except for this year.The War Cabinet decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer should confer with LordColwyn on the subject, and if, after consultation, he feltinclined to guarantee the price of the 1919 flax crop, heshould have the authority of tbe Cabinet to do so. If, onthe other hand, the Chancellor should not feel inclined topledge the Government to the required guarantee, thematter should again be brought before the War Cabinet attheir next meetine-.return of enemy subjects to theColonies and protectorates.7. The War Cabinet had before ,them a memorandum byMr. Long (Paper Gr.T.-65S3) in regard to the return of enemy subjects to the Colonies and Protectorates.In his memorandum Mr. Long stated that he had receivedstrong representations on the subject from Hong Kong and theStraits, and the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific had telegraphed his fears of the detrimental moral effect on the nativetribes of the return of the Germans. Mr. Long said that he was infavour of adopting a policy of exclusion of Germans from theColonies and Protectorates for a period of, say, five years, on fourgrounds : (a.) The very real clanger of their fomenting disloyalty ;(b.) The danger to the Germans themselves ;(c.) The importance of restoring our overseas trade without being hampered by the unfair competition of our lateenemies ;d .) The disastrous effect on the native mind of the triumphantreturn of the German.Mr. Long proposed that all Colonies and Protectorates shouldbe invited to legislate, without delay, prohibiting Germans from entering, residing, or trading locally in their territory for a periodof five years from the end of the war. Mr. Long added that, if were fused to take this step, he was afraid that there would be greatdissatisfaction in the Colonies and Protectorates concerned.
Representation ofNew Zealand atthe PeaceConference.8. Mr. Long drew the attention of the War Cabinet to a telegramfrom Paris, dated the 4 th January, No. 24, in regard to the questionof the representation of: the Dominions at the Peace Congress.According to this telegram it had been agreed between Mr. LloydGeorge and President Wilson that Canada, Australia, and SouthAfrica should have two representatives each, while New Zealand,British India, and the Native States of India should have one repre-sentative each. Mr. Long pointed out the splendid work that hadbeen done by New Zealand during the war. Her record in supplyingsoldier? according to population was better than that of any other ofthe Dominions. He felt sure that Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Wardwould, on their arrival, demand the same representation at the PeaceCongress as that accorded to the other Dominions.Mr, Barnes said that he was going to Paris on the following day, and undertook to make personal representations on this point to the Prime Minister.In the meantime, the War Cabinet requested Mr, Long to draft a telegram on the subject, to be sent to thePrime Minister (Appendix).Offences against 9.  With reference to War Cabinet 488, Minute 0, the Warthe Law by Enemy Cabine. had before them an Interim report bv a Committee to the individuals. Law Officers of the Crown (Paper G.T.-6549), and a note by SirRobei.&quot; Borders covering a Memorandum by the Judge-Advocate-Genen i of Canada (Paper G.T.-6610) in regard to offences againstthe law by enemy individuals.Sir Ernest Pollock said that the Attorney-General had tele-graphed i.o Mr. Balfour suggesting that those responsible in certain cases of outrr ges committed by the enemy on land and by sea andin air be placed on remand, so that they might be available whenneeded, and that a preliminary list of names had also now beendespati bed.Mr. Barnes asked whether it was not more important,insteac. of bringing to trial these culprits who were in a subor-dinate position, to place on trial the men at the very top, who were really responsible.To this Sir Ernest Pollock replied that the evidence relating tothe action of subordinates was important, because by such meanswould be disclosed what instructions had been given from above,and by whon..In the Interim Report of the Committee, certain heads of charges were provisionally suggested which should be preferredagainst offenders. Sir Ernest Pollock said that he hoped theCabinet would not reduce or alter the suggested list of these charges, because if any. of them were eliminated there was a danger that certain specific offences might not be covered. He saidthat the Committee had given particular attention to inquiring intothe constitution and procedure of a tribunal appropriate to the trial of offenders.The War Cabinet took note of the Interim Report, and desired the Solicitor-General to express to the members of theCommittee the thanks of the Cabinet for the workpei.-.yj-med, together with the hope that the work would Joecontinued.Mr. Grindle, of the Colonial Office, feared that not only wouldthere be great dissatisfaction, but that it was not unlikely thatthere would be regrettable incidents.The War Cabinet approved the proposals contained in mr. Long&apos;s memorandum in regard to the return of enemy subjects to the Colonies and Protectorates.
They instructed the Acting Secretary to send a copyof the Interim Report to Paris, together with a covering letter drawing the Prime Ministers attention (a) to the paragraph on jurisdiction, p. 1, in which it was recom-mendecl &quot; that the enemy Governments should supply(i) the names of all persons in command of prisoners&apos;camps, &amp;c, and (ii) all orders and instructions, Sec, which relate to acts in breach of the laws of war and of humanity&quot;; (b) the paragraph in the memorandum circulated by Sir Robert Borden emphasising the urgency of setting up the tribunal at the earliest possible-moment (Paper G.T.-6610).(Initialled) C. of K.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,January 15, 1919.APPENDIX.Copy of a telegram from the Acting Secretary to the War Cabinet to Sir maurice hankey, Paris.&quot; FOLLOWING from War Cabinet to Prime Minister&quot; We observe that New Zealand is only to have one representative. We suggest,this is to be regretted in face of following facts : -&quot; 1. White population does not materially differ from South Africa in number.&quot; 2. Representatives have not yet arrived.&quot; 3. Contribution in men is larger for population than any other Dominion.&quot; We think it a pity to risk serious dissatisfaction for sake of a single member.&quot;o
