In these Memoranda a proposal wasadvocated for obtaining a house ata rental of  4.500 a year, witheviction compensation of  20,000,which could, with suitable altera-tions estimated to cost  10,000,be made to accommodate the wholestaff.   The alternative was forthe majority of the Staff to live in hot els:Telegraphic Correspondence between his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at moscow and the Foreign Office (Paper O.P.-75 (30)) .The Cabinet were unfavourably impressed by the factthat even if the lease of the Charitomenko Housewere obtained, two Commercial Secretaries and the vice--Consul would still remain unaccommodated andwould have to occupy the existing Embassy house orcheaper alternative accommodation if available.With a view to a decision as soon as possible, theCabinet invited, the First Commissioner of Works tofurnish them with further information in regard tothe proposed Embassy.
RUSSIA.Jilieir?dKeligioiist;pergecution[previousj Reference:I Cabinet 11(30),  Oon-conclusion 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (paper c.P.-74 (30)) covering a Report from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Moscow,  dated February 2-4, 1930,  onthe subject of the alleged religious persecution inthe Soviet Union, together with a private telegramfrom the Ambassador pointing out the awkward situa-tion which would arise if the Report were published.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew- attention to a Question which was to be putin the House of Commons the same afternoon askingif he were prepared to -make a statement in relationto the Ambassador&apos; s Report, and he read to theCabinet, as a basis for discussion,  a draft of sucha statement, prepared in the Foreign Office.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, in reply to theParliamentary Question, shouldremind the House of Commons ofhis promise to publish in full the Soviet Government&apos;s decreeNo.353 of the 8th April. 1929,which would be in the hands ofHon. Members within a few days and would give full information:rb) That the Secretary of state should also have authority to announce that, after full consid-era-tion, it had been decided thatit would, not be in accordance withthe interests of the Public Servicethat the Ambassador&apos;s Despatch, orany document of the kind, should bepublished, and that a similar rule would have to apply to statementsbased on such information.   TheSecretary of State should have authority to add words to ^heeffect that,, in view of the greatpublic interest, he had consideredmost carefully whether an exceptioncould be made in the present instance,but had come to the conclusion thatit would be wrong to establish a precedent in this respect.

Anglo-Russian Commercial Relations.

(Previous Reference: Cabinet 53 (29), conclusion 7.)

3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (Paper C.P. 77 (30)) on the subject of Anglo-Russian Commercial Negotiations. In this Memorandum stress was laid on the great importance which the Russian negotiators are likely to attach to the inclusion in the proposed temporary Commercial Agreement of some reference to Export Credits. The question was raised at the end of the Memorandum as to whether or not the President of the Board of Trade should inform the Russian Ambassador that it is the considered decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government that no undertaking of any kind can be given in regard to Export Credit facilities for Anglo-Russian trade, and that we must insist on making this clear in the Agreement.

The Cabinet agreed --

(a) That the President of the Board of Trade should communicate to the Russian negotiators the following draft of a Protocol quoted on page 3 of his Memorandum:-

"In concluding the present Agreement the Contracting Parties are animated by the intention of eliminating from their economic relations so far as possible all forms of discrimination. They accordingly agreed that, in regard to the purchase and sale of goods, in regard to the employment of shipping and in regard to all similiar matters, they will be guided only by commercial and financial considerations, and subject to such considerations will adopt no legislative or administrative action of such a nature as to place the goods, shipping and trading organisations of the other Party in a position of inferiority as compared with the goods, shipping or trading organisations of any other foreign country".

The President of the Board of Trade was asked to report to the Cabinet the result of this negotiation.

Extension of Diplomatic Privileges to the Soviet Trade Delegation.

(b) That, while adhering to their decision of September 25th, 1929, (Cabinet 34 (29), Conclusion 1 (b), That the

 
Secretary of State should do his best to confine the granting ofspecial diplomatic privileges tothe Head of the Soviet tradingorganisations in London, and ifhe found it indispensable toextend the privilege the numbero^ persons to whom it should begranted should be as few aspossible and should be definitelyspecified&quot;,    the Secretary ofState should have authority, if He found it neces-sary, to extend diplomatic immunityto the rooms occupied by the individuals to whom specialdiplomatic privileges weregrant ed.
IMPERIAL 4.  The Cabinet had before them the followingDFFENCE.__ documents in regard to the employment of Air power the Bmploy-ment of Air in Imperial Defence:-T3PoweA Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Air (Paper CP .-332 (29))(Previous covering a Memorandum by the lateReference: Chief of the Air Staff advocating theCabinet 56 transfer of a number of responsi-(28), Con- bilities to the Royal Air Force fromelusion 8.) the older Services.   The Secretaryof State for Air, in his Memorandum.,urged that an authoritative Committeeshould be appointed by the Cabinet to review the whole question:A Note by the Secretary of s ate for&quot;ar (Paper CP .-356 (29)) urging thatif the Inquiry is to take place thereshould also be an examination, inconjunction with the Treasury,  of thequestion of the present constitutionof the Royal Air Force as a separateService:A further Memorandum, by the Secretaryof State -por Air (Paper CP..-365 (29))pointing out that since 1917 the ques-tion referred to by the Secretary ofState for war had been examined tentimes and that without exception theresult was in every case an unequivocalverdict in favour of a separate AirForce and Air Ministry:    and againemphasising that his only object wasto ask for an Inquiry into the specific points raised by Lord Trenchardwithout introducing what he regarded asan iri^s&apos;elevant issue:A Memorandum, by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (Paper CP .-369  (29)) insist-ing that if the Committee is to be setup it should deal comprehensively withall the aspects of the division ofresponsibility between the three fighting Services and that theCommittee should be.a Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Ministerthoiight it would be a great mistake to reopenab initio the question of a separate Air Forceand. Air Ministry, which should now be taken for
granted.    On the other hand, he was clear that theAdmiralty and War Office did not view with friendli-ness an Inquiry limited as proposed by the Secretaryof State for Air.   He was inclined to appoint aSub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defenceprovided that he could obtain agreement on a Termsof Reference.   He hoped that the Admiralty and WarOffice would not insist on a Terms, of Referencethat raised the larger questions of principle towhich he had referred.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister,  as Chairmanof the Committee of Imperial Defence,should try and secure an agreed Termsof Reference for the proposed Inquiry.
[CULTURAL 5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byICY.the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (paper cp .-76 (30)) in regard to the new situation in  f-  / Agriculture which had arisen from the recent proceed-ings in the Agricultural Conference and from variouspolitical developments.    In this Memorandum attention was drawn to the deterioration of the position of arable farmers, particularly in the corn-growingareas of Bast Anglia, and to the discouraging futureprospect.    After an examination of the possibleremedies, the opinion reached was in favour of an import Board.    It was stated that the farmers&apos;representatives would only regard an Import Boardscheme as satisfactory if it guaranteed    a   price to the British farmer for his wheat sufficient tomake its cultivation an attractive proposition.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, at theend of the Memorandum, asked the Cabinet to authorise him to announce that it had ordered the preparationof a Bill on these lines:    but if the Cabinet werenot willing to agree te artificial aid, he askedsanction for the preparation of an Import Board Billwithout that element.After considerable discussion the- cabinet agreed  (a) To hold a Special Meeting on TUESDAY.MARCH 11th, at 10-30 a .m ., at No.10Downing; Street, primarily for theconsideration of the question ofAgricultural Policy:(b) That, with a view to the above dis-cussion, the following documentsshould be circulated:-By the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, a Memorandum&apos; on the pro-posed Import Board, setting forth the scheme in full detail:    anda draft of the agricultural marketing Bill:
