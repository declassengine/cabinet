RGLO-PERSIAN 1.      The Cabinet had before them a Note by the(JfdTlATIONS-$V Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P. -8 (30))Previous ref-nce:- covering a Memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office onabinet 49(28),conclusion 1).    the suggested sale to Persia by Great Britain ofpatrol vessels for anti-contraband work in the persian gulf and proposed British Naval Mission for Persia.In the course of the Memorandum the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs stated that it is desirableon general political grounds that the request made through the Persian Minister for British assistance inthe formation, of a small fleet of Persian patrol vessels should, if possible, be met;    that there can be no questionof making any further financial concessions to Persia;that the pre-requisite of any arrangement regarding theships.must be the settlement of the pre-war debt and that it can therefore only be by some such arrangementas that suggested in the penultimate paragraph of his memorandum by which the ships should be actually paid for by Persia, that the Persian proposal can be met..The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thepossibility of the remission of debt incurred inwar-timeowing to military operations in the case of Persia being used as a precedent later on in the case of Iraq, but itwas pointed out that the cases wore not identical.The Cabinet agreed  That general instructions should be sent toSir R. Clive, His Majesty&apos;s Minister atTehsran, authorising him to proceed inaccordance with the penultimate paragraph ofthe Foreign Office Memorandum (CP. -8 (30)),on the clear understanding that the purchase ofjjl by Persia of her naval requirements in BritishHi shipyards was an essential condition of any$Hjp settlement.

The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda:, Memorandum respecting proposals to besubmitted &quot;by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom to the Conference.(CP.  -5(30)).Naval Construction Programme 1929.(CP, -2(30)).Note by the Chancellor of the exchequer covering a Memorandum by the treasury on the Financial Aspects of the naval conference.(CP. -12(30)).Mamorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty on the Financial Aspects ofthe Naval Conference.(C.P. -13(30)).Joint Report by the Admiralty and treasury on the Navy Estimates 1930.(CP. -14(30)).THE PRIME MINISTER made a full statement to theCabinet of the position reached in the conversations,announcements and speeches preparatory to the naval conference.      The Prime Minister reviewed indetail the position taken up by each of theother Naval Powers in regard to naval disarmament as a whole and in regard to eachcategory of ship and answered various questions.In the course of his statement the Prime Ministerread to his colleagues a letter which had been
received from the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the terms of which were endorsed by the Presidentof the Board of Trade. (Appendix 1).The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet during themeeting a Draft Memorandum on Policy which he had prepared and this was considered in detail and isembodied in the Cabinet findings.THE FIRST LORD reported fully the views of theAdmiralty on the questions to be raised at the Conferenceand the Prime Minister expressed his warm appreciation of the assistance and co-operation rendered by theAdmiralty throughout the preliminary examination of theproblem.In the course of the discussion emphasis was laid onthe importance of confining Cabinet conclusions on broad issues and leaving the details to the delegation to be handled in the light of circumstancesjks theydeveloped.The Cabinet agreed:-1.     That at the forthcoming Naval Conference thepolicy of the British Government regardingnaval reductions shall be as follows:-A. BATTLESHIPS.The Battleship is essentially andsolely a ship of war, and as politicalsecurity is strengthened, it must stand to disappear and the composition and operations of fleets be altered accord-ingly.   The Washington ConferenceAgreement took as its standard ofBattleship the type which had been evolved up to that date, declared amaximum tonnage, gun calibre, and thenumbers of ships to be built by the signatory pwwers.-3
This will be considered at the comingConference.An attempt should be made to get adeclaration from the Conference, on thelines of the first sentence of the aboveparagraph, to postpone all replacementsuntil the next Conference in 1935 hasbeen held and, in the meantime, to ask the Powers concerned to consider thequestion of battleships.    The BritishGovernment are making it clear that, ifthere is to be a transition period duringwhich battleships should be built, thenumbers agreed at Washington, the tonnageof the individual ships and the calibre ofthe guns should be reduced and the effect-ive age of the ships lengthened,B.CRUISERS.We have been conducting our preliminary-exchanges of view on the assumption thata programme of 70 Cruisers which has al-% ways been at the back of the mind of ourAdmiralty, should be definitely fixed atamaximum of 50, because we have believedthat if reasonable ratios on this basiscould be agreed to between other naval powers and ourselves, that would   leadto very drastic reductions in thenaval programmes which are now being produced.    Two classes of considerationhave had to be kept before us regardingCruisers:-(i) The number required in relationto existing Naval strategy.(ii) The Cruiser strength required for police and trade route purposestogether with the fulfilment of obligations which the presentunsettled state of certain partsof the world may suddenly: impose upon us. *We believe that the number of 50 isamply adequate to meet both of thoseclasses of requirements.   The size of the individual ships, however, tocan only be /
settled by international agreement andwe should make it plain that our policy should be to induce the Conference toreduce that to its lowest possible limits.DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES.The Government has declared its intentionto move for the total abolition of theSubmarine and as these two classesdepend upon each other, were it successful in inducing the other Naval Powers toaccept its proposal, very drasticreductions would follow.    In view ofthe opposition of france and Japan, thereis very little chance of our success inthis, however.       We shall, therefore,have to fall back upon reductions andshall have to use all the pressure wecan to bring Submarine strengths downto the utmost.     We should propose amaximum tonnage for. Submarines, not to exceed 1,500 tons, and also a maximumgross tonnage, which must includeboth the largest and the smallestSubmarines built.     There must be nounregulated Submarines as was proposedin the Anglo-French Agreement.The DESTROYERS should also have amaximum individual tonnage imposed,together with a gross total tonnage,which we should try to keep to notmore than 150,000.COMPETITIVE BUILDING:-Whatever the detailed result will he,we must see that the agreement com-pletely puts an end to competitivebuilding.    It will, therefore, benecessary for us to resist to theutmost all attempts made to transfer from one category to another any appreciable percentage of agreedmaximum tonnage.
E. PROPOSED MEDITERRANEAN AGREEMENT:-Attempts will no doubt be made tobring into discussion at the Conferencecognate political matters such as a mediterranean Agreement.   These wemust resist on principle, and striveto keep the Conference to Navalbusiness.    We may find it impossible,however, to do that with absoluterigidity, and in order to open theway for reasonable agreements, we mayhave to indicate our willingness toconsider certain political points.Our general attitude, however, mustbe unwillingness, and we ought to oppose every attempt to embody such agreements in the Naval Agreement.Furthermore, in speakingabfcut these agreements, we must make it clear thatthis country will refuse to take uponitself any obligations over and above those which it has already undertakenunder the Covenant of the League ofNations, Locarno agreement, etc.2. That the First Lord should take the first opportunity of informing the Board ofAdmiralty of the foregoing Conclusions,and should indicate that they were basedon political grounds, and that the most careful consideration had been giver/bothe views of the Admiralty throughout.3. That the main declaration of british policy should be made by the Prime minister in a plenary session at such time as hethought best.
G INDUSTRY.    3.      The Cabinet had &quot;before them:Interim Report of a Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Civil Research.(CP. -371(29)).Letter from the Chancellor of theExchequer to the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries.(0.1. -3(30))..The Cabinet approved generally the FirstInterim Report of the Sub-Committee on the fishing Industry of the Committee of Civil research on the understanding that the proposed surveyship should not only bo constructed under thedirection of the Admiralty but that it should be built in a Naval Dockyard.
KAGS OF fiABINETCUS3I0N ANDEES.Sious ref-linet 1(88),iciusion 8).II4.      THE PRIME MINISTER called the attention ofthe Cabinet to a serious leakage whioh hadtaken place in regard to a Cabinet discussion on Retirement Pensions.      This diooussion hadtaken place on Nov-ombcr 3rd 1929 and no detailedrecord of it had been included in the Minutes.Nevertheless there had appeared in the manchester ,  ....   ,   Guardian and the Yorkshire post of December 24th an accurate report of what hadtaken place.THE PRIME MINISTER impressed upon hiscolleagues the desirability of exercising thegreatest care in order to present the repetition of such   leakages.
5,      The Deputy Secretary was instructedto summon a Cabinet Meeting for to-morrow,Wednesday. 15th January, 1930,  at 11.0 a,m2 Whitehall Gardens,S.W.1.14th January 1930.
Letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Prime Minister,addressed from   HOTEL ;-,ITTE BRUG.THE ELuGUE.and dated     January 12th. 1930.I have just received with much surprise and dismay acopy of C.I. 5 (30), containing&apos; a draft of the proposals tobe submitted by the British Government to the Naval Conference,which I observe has not yet been finally examined by yourself,I think it ..ould be a great mistake to submit these proposals to the Conference as a minimum of our demands.In my opinion, they entirely fail to achieve the primary purpose of the Conference, namely, an all-round reduction ofthe fighting forces of the Powers.    If they go through, in afew yearsT time both we and the other Great Powers will haveNavies which are not less numerous, and arc positively more powerful, more up to date, and far more costly than thepresent fleets.    ..e shall have achieved this at an immense cost;our Navy Estimates will be in the neighbourhood of  64 millions a year, over 14^ more than they stood in the last Budget,of the Conservative Government; and we shall be in almost exactly the same relation to other Powers in respect of size,numbers and tonnage as we are now.This Memorandum creates a new situation, and the proposals contained in it appear to have been framed without any con-sideration of the financial implications.    My Memorandum(SVS.  (29) 18) might as well not have been 7/ritten, though Ihad understood that you agreed that the admiralty proposals with which it dealt were such as we could not possibly enter-tain on account of the increased cost involved.    I am informed
that this new paper (C,Pa 5 (30)) v/as not submitted to theTreasury before it was issued, though it proposes changes which will gr&amp;a&amp;ly increase the Navy Estimates.    I must also express regret that it was sent to the Dominions before i had had an opportunity to consider it from the financial aspect.I feel sure that the oountry will be quick to appreciate that the present proposals offer no relief to the taxpayerfroa the existing burden of Naval expenditure,   ^s is pointedout In .7.S.  (29) 189 reduced Naval Estimates depend on areduction of the size of the British Fleet pari passu withother Powers.    I urge that we should lead the way vith ascheme designed to secure this object.I hope that this will include a plan for reducing thenumber of Capital ships, even though this means the immediatescrapping of half a dozen vessels.    I see no reason why weshould not be content with6 say, 14 capital ships rather than20, provided that other Powers will follow suit.    Such areduction would effect a substantial saving in maintenancecosts, would lead ino.irectly to reduction of other classesof ships, and would have an immensely valuable effect as amoral gesture on our part.    Indeed I would have much preferred to go further and put forward a proposal for the abolition ofthe capital ship, 7/hich is a useless ornament.    Such a proposal would probably get the support of Prance, Italy and Japan.In no circumstances can I approve the Admiralty proposals that the future size of capital ships should be settled here and now at 25,000 tons, and that replacement should commenceat the rate of one a year before 1936.    It is out of thequestion t at we should be asked to settle matters of suchmagnitude at a few hours1 notice..The U.S..U. are clearly right in proposing that thisquestion be postponed until 1936, and that meanwhile no new ships be laid down.    The Dockyard position must be considerediic
in the light of disarmament.    ,,-fter all this is a matter ofa few hundred men. not thousands. cannot allow the dockyard situation to determine our building programme asthe admiralty propose.    If we do4 there will never be any reduction.    Co/;spand money on shipbuilding to find work isthe most wasteful form of expenditure, for not only Is thecapital cost wasted, but it involves permanent waste inmaintenance.I desire also to support the proposal which I under-stand that Thomson has already put before you, that thetonnage of aircraft Carriers be limited to, say, 84,000 tons,to include all carriers of whatever size, other Powers toreduce proportionately.I beg you to reconsider the present draft memorandum in the light of these observations, and to ask yourselfwhether, when your proposals are made public, it will notbe justifiably represented that Great Britain is the realobstacle to a reduction of naval armaments.For my part,  I am seriously disturbed about the probableresults of t e Conference, and my fears have been increasedby this Memorandum and Alexander&apos;s recent speeches.    Yourvisit to America has aroused great expectations of navalreductions, and when the public realise that our own proposals to the Conference involve millions a year of Increase in naval Estimates, the reaction will be terrific.    Lloyd George,I know, is feverishly waiting for just this opportunity, and ourown people will be driven into revolt.    It would be better to propose a big reduction we might not get than to submit whatis In effect a bi . increase.I should be grateful if you would read this letter tothe Cabinet and inform them that the President of the Boardof Trade wishes to associate himself with it.    Pardon its
Inoutspokeness, but I do feel that everything - the future of disarmament and our good faith - is at stake in the line we take at this Conference.
