ijRlGULTURAL(previous refer enc e:Cabinet 14(SO), Con-elusion 1.)9. The Cabinet had before them a letter to thePrime Minister from the Secretary of State for War,as Chairman of the Committee on Agricultural Policy(Paper 0.P.-99 (SO)) expressing the opinion that the organised marketing of home-grown produce by a co-operative method would be to the advantage of arablefarmers, as well as to the general advantage of theagricultural industry in Great Britain, and recommend-ing that the Government should adopt the agricultural marketing Bill.   The Committee pointed out, however,that the establishment of a marketing organisation would not meet the problem raised by the presentdepression of cereal prices, and stated that in theopinion of some of the members further measures arenecessary.   The Committee were therefore consideringthe two policies:-(i)  for requiring by legislation themilling of a proportion of home-grown wheat by all British mills:(ii)  for the creation of a State monopolyfor the bulk purchase of grain and/or control of British flour mills.The Gomar.ittee hoped to report on these two questionsby Tuesday, March 25th.While a good deal of support was given to timeAgricultural Marketing Bill, the general view ofthe Cabinet was that no announcement should be made until material was available for the considerationof Agricultural Policy as a whole.    In view of theobjections raised against some       of the heads ofpolicy that were under consideration by theComrcittee, the suggestion was made that it mightbe a good plan to publish a White Paper surveyingall the different proposals and containing fact as to the real position of Agriculture.
The subject was adjourned untilthe next weekly Meeting of theCabinet, by which time it was hoped that a further Report wouldbe available from the Secretaryof State for &apos;var&apos;s Committee.
