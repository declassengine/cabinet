TEE GENERAL 1. The Cabinet had before them the Report of a stoppage OP1926 . Cabinet -Committee appointed to consider the position the Position o^ Government employees who took part in the generalof EstablishedAdmiralty Em-   stoppage o^ 1926 (Paper C.P.-71 (30)).   The Reportployees who took part. was in two sections:    (i) a section signed by theFirst Lord o&apos;&apos; the Admiralty and the First commissioners-(previous reference: sioner o&quot;r orks, recommending the adoption of err lie:Cabinet 4( 30)., Con-       proposals set out in paragraphs 11 and 13 of the elusion 10.)First Lord&apos;s Memorandum (Paper 0 .P.-248 (29)) namely,that, the penalty should be remit4&quot; ed. as an act ofgrace,  in all the cases other than that of the man who was dismissed for alleged definite acts ofmisconduct,  and that his case should not be reopenedunless the Trade Unions concerned do so and produceprima facie evidence of a miscarriage of justice.After pointing out that after the termination of the stoppage of 1926 the late Prime Minister had appealed to Railway Companies and other large undertakings notto alter the conditions of employment 0* their employees who returned to work, the First Lord andthe First Commissioner of &quot;&quot;orks expressed the viewthat it is unthinkable that Government employees inGovernment establishments should be submitted to less favourable treatment than the late Prime Ministeradvocated in the case of railway and other employees;(ii) a section signed by the Financial Secretary tothe Treasury,  dissenting from the recommendations ofhis colleagues and expressing the opinion that thedecision reached by the Government in September, 1929,not to make any change in this matter, should beallowed to stand.
The Cabinet agreed  That there should be an amnesty asregards Government employees who took part in the general stoppage of 1926, with the result that thefuture pensions of government employees who had taken part inthe general stoppage would beconsidered under the ordinaryprocedure as though the stoppagehad not taken place.
CHINA.Piracy(previous reference:Cabinet 11(29), Con-clusion 8.)2.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents In regard to Piracy in China Waters:-A Memorandum by the Oversea DefenceCommittee (0.D.C.-585 M):A Report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence (Paper 0 .P.-87(30)) in regard to the above memorandum, the conclusions ofwhich were summed up as follows:-(I) If the continuance of the regularnaval and military guards for afurther definitely limited period is ordered by the Cabinet, itshould be subject to the followingcondit ions:-(i) That the Shipping Companiesagree before the 1st april to accept an elaboration ofthe present scheme underwhich Indian guards are madeavailable by the ColonialPolice authorities for theinternal protection ofshipping:(ii) That any regular guards suppliedafter the 31st March should bepaid for in full by the shipping companies.(II) That the whole cost of the elaboratedscheme, including that of maintaining the Indian guards when not actuallyemployed on board ship,  should beborne by the Companies in proportion to their demands on it.The Cabinet agreed -Subject to the concurrence of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs(who had not had time to consult his department in regard to the Report,owing to its having been circulatedonly on the previous evening), to sanction a further extension ofthe provision of regular naval andmilitary guards on the conditionssuggested by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee, and that in coromuni-cating the decision to the shipownersit should be made very clear thatthere is a definite time limit tothe continuance of the extension.(The First Lord of the Admiralty had to leave at this point toattend a Meeting in connection with the London Naval Conference.)
(Pr previous reference:Cabinet 13(30), Con-elusion 3.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his  colleagues that his negotiations withthe Russian Soviet Government had hitherto been conducted on the assumption that they would include a modus vivendi in regard to commercial affairsrather than a Commercial Treaty.    It now transpired,however, that from a &quot;Parliamentary point of view this was an inconvenient procedure.   A modus vivendi,since it had no time limit, would require a ratifica-tion clause, and this would involve a Debate.   Later,when it was superseded by a Commercial Treaty,  asecond Debate would be necessary.    In the presentpressure on the Parliamentary programme this wasinconvenient.   In addition, the proposal for a modus vivendi had reacted on the Russian negotiators, whohad also suggested a temporary instead of a permanentarrangement in regard to fisheries.    Ee consulted the Cabinet as to whether it woufLd not be advisable to endeavour to negotiate a Commercial Treaty insteadof a modus yiyendi.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary o^ State forForeign Affairs should exercise his own judgment as to the best way of handling the question ofthe Commercial Agree.: ent .Anglo-RussianCommercialRelations .
The Questiono ^ eo   uni-eating, theReport to theDominions.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had been asked by theHigh Commissioner       South Africa for a copy o^ theReport from Ris Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow dated february 24, 1930,  on the subject of the allegedreligious persecution in the Soviet. Union.The Cabinet were reminded that it was usual tosend confidentially to the Prime Ministers o^ *:beDominions, and to the Dominions High Commissioners,despatches which were circulated to the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That if the Report in question would be circulated in the norroalcourse, no exception should be madein this particular ease:(b) That the Secretary of State ^or foreign Affairs should mention thematter to Lord Stam^ordham before taking action as in (a):(c) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should call theattention of the Dominions authori-ties concerned   to the der-and that had been made ^or the publicationof this Report and should ask that special care be taken to treat itas a highly confidential document.AllegedRelig iousPers ecut ion.fPrev religious reference:Cabinet IS(30), Con-elusion 3.)
(previous reference:Cabinet 11(36), Con-elusion 3( c) .)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention o^ the Cabinet to a telegram fromthe British Ambassador at Moscow stating that thereare rumoutrs that the Soviet Gove?rnment are contem,-   -plating some official demarche to protest againstIntercessory Prayers at religious Services formilitary forces in Great Britain (Moscow telegramNo .114,  of March 11th)  and asking for details  as tothe decision of r&quot;is Majesty&apos;s Government .The Prime Minister referred to the satisfactorycorrespondence he had had with the Archbishop o^Canterbury on the subject, which indicated a substan-tial measure of agreement.KBInter cess cry!

(previous reference:Cabinet 13(30), Con-clusion 1.)6. In addition to the Memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs and the first commissioner of Works (Paper CP.-70 (30)) which hadbeen under consideration at the Meeting referred toin the margin, the Cabinet had before them a furtherJoint Report by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the First Commissioner of ^orks on thesubject of Accommodation for His Majesty&apos;s embassy at Moscow (Paper CP.-92 (30)).    In this memorandum it was stated that it had proved impossible to devise a plan which would accommodate the whole of theFission in Charitonenko House.   The use of the Charib-nenko and Hodgson houses would involve an annual expenditure of approximately  14,000, an increaseof  4,000 per annum over present arrangements.    Itwas emphasised that only a long tenure of the Charito-nenko House would justify the payment of the  20,000for compensation and a further expenditure of some 18,000 on alterations .   In the event of the Sovietterms being accepted it was suggested that the Hodgsonhouse should only be retained if it proves impossibleto make cheaper arrangements for the surplus staf&quot;*%and in the event of the position becoming more stableit was suggested that it might be economical toconstruct a ne^ building in the garden of CharitonenkoHouse with a view to  concentrating the whole Missionthere.The Cabinet were informed that the arrangementproposed would not involve a Supplementary Estimate.No other alternative proposal being available,the Cabinet agreed  The MoscowEmbassy .

in his view this should he done(;as in the c-se of the UnitedStates) by special bilateralagree ent and subject to adequate safeguards.    The President was definitely o&quot;&quot; opinion that noConvention which accepted eithero&quot;r these bises should be signed by Gre--t Britain.The attention of the Cabinet was called to the hardships which the present position inflicted onfisher-men in certain territorial inlets, such asthe Moray Firth.    The Cabinet were also informedthat the Dominions were not likely to take a di^er-ent vie1&quot; from that proposed in the Memorandum by theSecretary of State &quot;&quot;or Foreign Affairs .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the British Delegates should be instructed, to maintain strong adherence to the system of a 3 mile liit.it, and where exceptions might have to bemade this should be done by specialbilateral agreement, subject to adequate safeguards,  as in the caseo^ the United States  of America:(b) That the Secret^rjr of State forScotland should forward to theSec&quot;etary c&quot; State &quot;&quot;or ForeignAffairs particulars of the diffi-culties which had arisen in Scottishwaters, and. the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs undertook thatthe matter should be care/hilly con-sidered and referred to the british delegation at Geneva &quot;ror appropriate action.

The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the Whitehall Gardens (MontaguHouse) Site:-A Memorandum^ by the First commissioner of Works (Paper CP.-67 (30)) drawingthe attention of the Cabinet to the urgent need of a decision being taken on the question of the proposeddevelopment of the Whitehall Gardens(Montagu House) site.   The recommenda-tion   of the First Commissioner ofWorks was that steps should be takento introduce at the earliest oppor-tunity in the next Session of Parlia-ment a Bill to amend the building linelaid down in the Act of 1912, and thata Supplementary Estimate for a nominalsum be subsequently presented to enablethe preliminary arrangements for thedevelopment of this site to be under-taken during the forthcoming financialyear:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion A^^i^s and forthe Colonies (Paper CP.-86 (30))bringing to the notice of the Cabinetthe serious congestion in regard to accommodation in the Dominions Officeand Colonial Office.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs drew attention to the urgent need for a new dominions office      . if the next Imperial Conference made this necessary .The Prime Minister asked the Cabinet to note that there was no extension proposed of the cabinet offices.The Cabinet approved generally theproposals of the First commissioner of Works in Paper CP.-67 (30) and asked him to proceed on the basis ofthe larger scheme numbered G.7.

The advances must be made a first charge on the cane and/or sugar produced, and anyfurther legislation necessary for the purpose mustbe introduced and should provide for an obligationto cultivate after receipt of the money.    If theColonial Governments would make these arrangements
His Majesty&apos;s Government would ask Parliament indue course to provide half of any loss that may be incurred by the Colony tinder the guarantee, theother half falling on Colonial funds, provided thatthe total losses to which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill contribute half shall not exceed  Barbados    ..............  60,000British Guiana  ........  100,000Jamaica  ................  40,000Trinidad  ...............  60,000Leewards   ...............  20,000 for Antiguaand  15,000 for St, KittsWindwards..............  5,000As regards Mauritius it was proposed that thecorresponding telegram should be modified in the sense that His MajestyTs Government are making this offer to the West Indies and are prepared to do thesame for Mauritius subject to any modifications of detail rendered necessary by local conditions,  andsubject to an over-riding total liability of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to the Colony of one half of 200,000, which is a round figure bearing roughly the-same proportion to  300,000 as the average sugarexport 0&quot;*&quot; Mauritius bears to the average West Indianexports.In addition, the Secretary of State for theColonies   had undertaken to make representations tothe Secretary of State for India with a view to achange in the Indian Customs Tariff in favour of sugar imports from Mauritius, particularly withreference to a suggestion that it would be of material assistance if India could exercpt Mauritius sugar fromthe increase of Duty proposed in the new Indian Budget,even if she could not see her way to giving the Colonymore preferential treatment.
