THE COVENANTOP THE LEAGUECP NATIONS.ProposedAmendmentsto Articles12,  13 and.15.LONDON naval conference.The PoliticalNegotiationswith Prance .(previous reference:Cabinet 19(30.)The Cabinet resumed their dis cuss ion-of thedraft Declaration on the understanding by the signatories of the position as regards securityas it now exists for members of the League ofNations,  and more particularly on paragraphs 5to 8 thereof (Appendix to Cabinet 19 (30) .)The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs emphasised that the draft statement had been handed to the French ad referendum to the United kingdom delegation, to the Cabinet and to the BritishCommonwealth Delegates.   The French delegation were quite aware of this.It was pointed out that paragraph 5 did givethe impression in words of going rather beyondexisting commitments, although in fact it did not go beyond the attitude which any British Govern-ment would be certain to adopt in the event of an act of aggression being brought before the Gouncilof the League.The Cabinet were informed that it was almost-certain that the Dominions would not accept anyprocedure which involved the use of their military,naval or air forces without a resolution by theirrespective Parliaments.Eventually it was decided to adopt a similarattitude here towards the draft statement (see below (a) .)    It was recognised that in%iy event the obligations must be reported to the Dominions,whose decisions.could not be anticipated.It was suggested that the dra:pt Declarationm,ight include a clause similar to Article IX ofthe Locarno Treaty, as follows:-
&quot;The present Treaty shall impose no obligation upon any of the british dominions., or upon India., unlessthe Government of such Dominion,or of India, signifies its aceept-anoe thereof&quot;The bearing of the Motion for the Adjournment,which had been moved for the same evening, uponthe decisions now to be taken was discussed.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should arrange for a message to be con-veyed at once to M. Mass*igli,  ofthe French Delegation, invitinghim to notify M. Briand in Paristhat the Cabinet were preparedto accept all the clauses of thedraft Declaration except those relating to Article XVI of theCovenant, in regard to which theymust insist on the followingaBiendments :-Paragraph 5 to be amended bythe insertion of the wordsunderlined in the following extract:-&quot;Since, before making reeora-mendations under paragraph 2Of Article XVI as to the effective military, naval or air force which (in accordancewith the terms of the Covenantitself.  fthe Members of theLeague shall severally contri-bute to the armed forces to beused to protect the covenantsof the League^, the council will necessarily have takeninto account the militarysituation and the geographical position of the States concerned,our Governments declare their intention of complying promptlywith the recommendations whichthe Council may make under thisparagraph and of irrimediatelyconsulting Parliament with aview to fulfilling loyally and effectively their obligations under paragraph 1 of the saidArticle&quot;.Paragraph 8 to be amended by theaddition of the words underlinedbelow, to read as follows:-&quot;Our Governments undertake to do everything in their power, inco-operation with other Membersof the League, to ensure thatthese amendments shall be.
incorporated in the Covenantwith the least possible delay and receive the consent ofParliament&quot; .(NOT- BY THE SECRETARY:    In communicatingthe above to Mr Craigie, the Secretaryalso drew his attention to the amendment to paragraph 4, which had been adopted at the Meeting of the Cabinet the same morning (Cabinet 19 (50), page 5) . )As regards the Clauses relating to article XVI it should be emphasisedto M. Massigli that the obligationsmust be reported to the Dominions,whose decision could not be anti-cipated.   It should be added thatthe Government feel bound to letM. Briand kno^&apos; at once that he andhis colleagues ought to considerthe proposed Declaration on thebasis of these decisions.(b) That, in reply to the Motion forthe Adjournment, the Prime minister should refer to. the following state-ment he made in the House of commons on the 30th January, 19 30, in replyto a Question by Mr Baldwin:-&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER:    The House:will readily understand that itis neither in accordance withprecedent nor in the national interest that questions on thebusiness of a Conference like this should be put during theprogress of the Conference  on its day-to-day work.   Thatwould make the task of theBritish delegation impossible.I am. sure that is not what is meant by the right hon. Gentle-man&apos;s question.   There may,howrever, be points in the   -progress of &quot;the work of theConference when a statementmight properly be made to theHouse, and, if the leaders of either of the other parties would consult me whenever theythink that  information is&apos;   required, I should be glad todiscuss with them, the advisability.bili.tyof a question..    On the otherhand, if I should think that theHouse ought to be informed of anything which has happened&apos; Ishall arrange for a question &apos;through the usual channels:&quot;.The Prime Minister,., on referring tothis answer,  should suggest that thematter should stand over-until the /:-m?
Leaders of the Opposition werehack, when,  if they thought desirable   the Leaders who hadnot consulted him up to thepresent could do so.2, Whitehall Gardens, S .&quot;&quot;.1,April 7,  19 30.
