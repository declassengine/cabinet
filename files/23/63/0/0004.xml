CABINETBUSINESSDURING THENAVAL CON-PERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 1 -(SO), Con-elusion^.)1.   The Prime Minister said, he hoped to be able toCabinetk-eep in touch with/business during the progress ofthe London Naval Conference, but he asked theChancellor of the Exchequer to assist him by keepinga close watch on the business in general.-1-
2*   The Prime Minister reported that he hadreceived a letter from the First. Lord of theAdmiralty, dated January 15, 1930, enclosing aMemorandum from the First Sea Lord setting forth the views of the Naval Lords of the Admiraltywhich they were anxious the Prime Minister shouldhave before him In connection with the decision tobe taken on the Navy Estimates for 1930.   extracts from the Memorandum were read to the Cabinet.The Cabinet took note of the letter and Memorandum, which it was decidedshould be attached as an appendix to these Conclusions.
THE SINGAPORE 3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theNAVAL BASE.  First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP.-20 (30)) onThe Malay States&apos;Contribution.     the subject of the Malay States&apos;  contribution to thecost of the Singapore Naval Base.    In this Memorandum(previous cueReference: it was pointed out that if the payment of the contri-Cabinet 47(29), Con-        bution during the next ten weeks, as proposed by the elusion 7.)High Commissioner for the Malay States, cannot be counted on, a supplementary Estimate for the navy would be necessary.   The deficit would have to be explained as resulting from the loss of the Malaymoney, and an embarrassing Debate on Singapore inthe middle of the Naval Conference would probablyresult.   On the other hand, a discussion in Malayaas to whether the consideration for the contributionhas failed or no is only slightly less undesirable.The Memorandum contained the suggestion that a further telegram should be sent to the High Commissioner fromthe Colonial Office to the following effect:-&quot;Have referred your telegram of 1st january to His Majesty&apos;s Government, who thinkposition cannot be fully understood.   no decision has been taken affecting scopeof scheme or date of completion.   the precautionary slowing down of work pendingNaval Conference can have no effect on thatdate.   Decision to withhold contribution,therefore, appears premature unless it isprecautionary on supposition that money would be lost in the event of results ofNaval Conference leading to entire changeof policy regarding Base.   On this I amto assure you that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment recognise that if scheme were abandonedor altered fundamentally contributions would have to be refunded or adjusted asmighrbe mutually agreed.    In those circumstances it is thought no questionof consultation with Rulers or federal council about present payment need arise.In opinion of His Majesty&apos;s government it would be very undesirable for such a discussion on Base to arise in Malayawhile Naval Conference is sitting and still more undesirable to have Parlia-mentary Debate here as would be unavoidableif contribution actually budgeted for isnot received&quot; .-3-
After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for theColonies should send a telegram tothe High Commissioner of theFederated Malay States on the lines proposed by the Admiralty, accompanied,at his discretion, by a private tele-gram .
unemployment policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(30), Con-conclusion 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Privy Seal (Paper CP.-21 (30)) on thesubject of a speech he recently made at Manchesterin which, after describing the general unemployment policy of the Government, he made an announcement asto the readiness of the City to consider sympathet-ically the proposals that may be put forward for assisting the re-organisation of industry on soundlines.   The Memorandum also contained particulars of the action the Lord Privy Seal is taking tofollow up this pronouncement, and concluded by astatement that in certain quarters the over-ridingcause of the rather sombre outlook in employment is the fear that the Eudget may be an unfavourableone.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that since circulating his Memorandum he had been in touchwith the Presidents of the principal Banks, four outof five of whom were supporting his policy.   Hecommunicated the names of a very strong Committee ofBankers which had been set up and which would assist them on the financial side, as well as of an equallystrong Committee on the industrial side.   BothCommittees would meet twice a week.The Prime Minister instructed theSecretary to keep the Lord privy seal*s Memorandum on the Agenda,with a view to a discussion as soonas convenient.

Lettor from the First Lord of the Admiralty to the Prims Minister.15th January, 1930.My Dear Prime Minister,I send you herewith a Memorandum which I have receivedfrom the First Sea Lord setting fcrth the views of my Uavalcolleagues on the Board of Admiralty which they are very anxious that you should.-have before you in connection with the decisionto be taken on the Wavy Estimates for 1930,Yours sincerely,(Signed) A.V. Alexander,The Pit. Hon. 3. Ramsay MacDonald, M.P.NAVAL_CONSTRUCTION   PROGRAMME   1929.Re-port of Fighting Seryi.ces-Comm111ee.MEMORANDUM   BY___THE__FIRS T   SEA   LORD.First^LordAThe Naval Members of the Board of Admiralty understandthat the Fighting Services Committee have decided to recommend tothe Cabinet a drastic modification of the construction programme already presented to Parliament (Command 3283).That programme made provision for the laying down duringthe 1929 financial year of -3 Cruisers1 Flotilla leadejr8 Destroyers6 Submarines1 net layer and Target Towing Vessel6 Sloops
The Fighting Services Committee propose tothe Cabinet that instead of the above the 1929 programmeshall consist of -1 Cruiser1 Flotilla Leader4 Destroyers3 S ubmarines4 Sloops.In regard to this recommendation, the NavalMembers of the 3oard of Admiralty deem it their duty toask that the following representations may be put beforethe Prime Minister for communication to the Cabinet if he thinks proper.cruisers.The question of adequate cruiser numbers is a vital one.     Repeated investigations carried out and laid&apos;before successive governments and Imperial Conferenceshave established the number of 70 cruisers as necessaryfor defending our sea communications in all parts of theworld, the United States of America not being taken Intoaccount as a possible enemy.But our present number of cruisers is only 58,of which no fewer than 34 will reach the extreme age limit of 20 years and must pass out of service between now and1940, so that merely on the basis of replacing losses,since it takes 3 years to build a cruiser, the programmeyears 1929 to 1936 inclusive ought to provide for 34cruisers.The Admiralty were requested, on the initiation of conversations in July last with the U.S.A., to give full consideration to the general peaceful international situation and to the great importance attached by the PrimeMinister to the political effect of the Pact of Paris,  the signing of which was to form the basis of the negotiationsof tha Prime Minister.     As a result,  the Admiralty finally
agreed that, twinng jnj^^^jAfiTrf^tijnrx^riri 1. the relevantpoU-ti-cal.-factors, they could regard naval requirements   ,as satisfied for a limited period with a n-imber of 50oruisars, provided proper provision was made in the meanwhile for the steady replacement of our war builtcruisers which was an essential condition.The Admiralty opinion was reported to theDominions on the 15th September as follows -&quot;in view of the general international position and thesituation created by the Paris Pact, the Admiralty is satisfied that if agreement can be reached with the UnitedStates on the basis of present proposals, and themaintenance of the Washington ratios with other Powers,the security and interests of the British Empire are safe-guarded and my technical and political advisers unanimouslysupport the above proposals&quot;.These proposals, reported to the Dominions andunanimously supported by the technical and politicaladvisers of the Prime Minister, involved the completionof fourteen new cruisers by 1936, in replacement of eighteenwartime cruisers, and four ships of the &quot;Effingham&quot; Class.It was on this basis that the Washington conversationswere initiated, and the Admiralty in accepting thenumber of 50 cruisers assumed that there would be no -question but that the necessary construction programmes of 2 cruisers in 1929 and 3 cruisers in 1930, 31, 32 and33, would be authorised.ISven so, it was recognised that there may be great difficulty in maintaining the total of 50 cruisersafter 1936, in view of the fact that 14 cruisers will reach the extreme age limit between 1936 and 1940.The Fighting   Services Committee have, however,recommended to the Cabinet that the 1929 programme should be only 1 cruisersinstead of the &quot;two necessary
to comply with the Prime Minister1s policy atWashington.,DLSTROZLRS.The position in regard to destroyers iscertainly equally,  if not more, unsatisfactory than,that In regard to cruisers.The trend of negotiations has made it clearthat the most we can hope for is an agreement as atotal limitation figure of something &quot;between200,000 tons and 150,000 tons..    The latter figureindeed assumes such a low figure for, foreignsubmarine tonnage as to rule it out for practical purposes  in view of the    attitude of branee and japan on the submarine guest ion..On the 31st December, 1936, allowing forall approved programmes, our under-age destroyertonnage will have shrunk to a figure of 38,581 tons.If, therefore, we assume agreement upon even the lowest possible figure of 150,000 tons, this means that In five programme years we ought to complete111,419 tons of destroyers,, giving an annual programmeof 22,300 tons.Again, taking full account of the generalsituation, the Admiralty have suggested an annualprogramme of only 12,600 tons, approximately,giving us each year a new flotilla of 1 leader and destroyers.   :-  The Fighting Services Committee, however,recommend that the 1929 programme should make
provision for only 7,000 tons approximately towards ourdeficit of 111,419 tons.    This  amount is entirelyinadequate for defensive requirements, and places theBritish Empire in a position of considerable inferiorityto Japan.    is.&apos;ith no further construction, Japan will have72 under-age destroyers of a tonnage of 95,305 tons in1936 as compared with our 35 destroyers of a tonnage of45,581 tons.In the foregoing remarks the Naval Members ofthe Board of Admiralty have endeavoured to draw attention to the serious situation that will result fromthe cancellation of the entire cruiser programme for 1928and the suggested reduction in all types for 1929.In their opinion, the inclusion of two cruisers and a complete flotilla of destroyers iQ the 1929programme is a necessity for the maintenance of the fleet at the lowest level considered either reasonable or safe,and whatever the result of the London Conference, thatnecessity will remain.It Is understood from the report of theFighting Services Committee that the Chancellor of theExchequer only consented to the proposed skeleton 1929programme on the understanding that there would be afurther large reduction in Naval Estimates effected mainly by :-(a) Suspending for 1930 the building up of thenaval oil fuel reserve;(b) Cancelling the new flights required for theFleet Air Arm both in 1929 and 1930.
The Naval Members of the Board of Admiraltytherefore deem it their duty to advise that a steadyadherence to the policy of the Oil Fuel Reserve, as approvedby the Committee of Imperial Defence, and an adequatedevelopment of the Fleet Air Arm, so   as to keep our naval air strength comparable to that of other Powers,  are bothmatters of urgent importance if the Fleet is to be capableof fulfilling its responsibilities in case of emergency.(Signed)  C.1l, Madden.8th January, 1930.
