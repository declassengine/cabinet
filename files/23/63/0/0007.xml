Il/iPLOYMENT 1,      The Cabinet had been summoned at short noticelURAKCE BILL.to consider the position which had arisen from theaction of the House of Lords earlier in the day inllevious Ref-^Ince: re-imposing in the Unemployment Insurance BillBinet 5(30)Inclusion 5)c        a time limit of twelve months which had been rejected by the House of Commons,It was explainod that an attempt had beenmade on the evening of the 29th January to get ameeting of the Cabinet to consider reports received of party feelings but that  only a few Ministers hadbeen present and the meeting was therefore informalbut that it had been agreed to rescind the conclusions reached by the Cabinet on January 29th(Conclusion 5(a)) which had provided for thesubstitution of the date June 30th 1933 for thedate March 31st,  1931,It was further explained that it was now open tothe Commons to accept, reject or amend the Lords1amendmente      The Commons could insist on theirdisagreement with the Lords&apos; Amendment and in that .event the Bill would be killed;    or they coulddecide not to insist on this disagreement and propose an amendment (or amendments) to the Lords&apos;Amendment.The Cabinet agreed(a) To reaffirm the conclusion reached at cabinet 5(30), viz:&quot;That the Lords&apos; Amendment limiting theoperation of the Unemployment insurance bill to a period ending March 31st,1931,  should be amended by the .substitution of June 30th, 1933, asthe limit.&quot;(b) To announce this conclusion to a meeting o\fthe Parliamentary Labour Party to be summoned on the following morning.(c) To request the Chief Whip to take thenecessary steps to give effect to the abtfve*
2.      THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE reportedto the Cabinet the position reached in the negotiationswith the Liberal Leaders and the other Partiesspecially interested in the Coal Mines Bill.The chief difficulty continued to centre round the Liberal proposal that the consideration ofPart I of the Bill in Committee should be postponed until after the other parts of the Bill had been disposed of.     Mr. Graham stated that he hadreceived general assurances from the Liberals that ifthis were done they had no intention of wrecking theBill but only of improving it, but it had been made plain that Mr,  Lloyd George was strongly opposed tothe quota provisions in their present form.Mr. Graham reminded the Cabinet of the considerableconcessions which had already been made to secureLiberal support and that further concessions wouldstrain the loyalty of the Miners1 Federation and theminers&apos;  representatives in the House.      In hisopinion it was essential to secure from the Liberalsa definite understanding either privately or on the floor of the House that Part I should be preservedsubstantially in its present form,  inasmuch as to cut out Part I would ruin the Bill.In the course of the discussion which followodI)the statement of the President of the Board of Tradeit was pointed out that unless the Government agreedto postpone Part I and secured Liberal support thereby,.Part I might be lost by a combination of Conservativesand Liberals.      Further,, it was understood that ifPart I were postponed Liberals would be preparedto support the Government in having recourse to theguillotine.-2-
The Cabinet agreed(a) That a consultation shauld takeplace immediately between thefollowing Ministers and Mr. LloydGeorge:The President of the Board of Trade,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,in order to discover whether asatisfactory undertaking in regard to part I could be secured from the Liberal(b) That if a satisfactory pledge was obtained it should also be arranged that an amendment to postpone Part Ishould be moved not by the Liberals butby the President of the Board of Trade.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.3rd February 1930.
