CHINA. 1. The Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments relating to British Policy in China:-(previous reference: A Memorandum by the Secretary ofCabinet 52 State for Foreign Affairs (Paper(29), Con- C.P.-6 (SO)) covering   for the elusion 1.) information of his colleagues, an exhaustive statement both of thepresent position In China and of thepolicy he is pursuing to meet require-ments there.   His policy was explainedas one of gradual and progressiverevision of Treaties by friendlynegotiation with the Chinese andafter consultation in matters of joint interest with other powers concerned.   It is based on a Memo-randuiii of the 18th December, 1926,and the Treaty revision offer of thefollowing January, which at the time had received the support in Parliamentof the present Prime Minister and hiscolleagues.   As regards extra-territorialityit was explained that the Secretary ofState is prepared to go a considerableway in the surrender of extra-territorial rights in civil matt ers in return forcertain safeguards, but he was notprepared as yet to surrender thoserights in criminal cases,  except,perhaps, in regard to such minormatters as breaches of municipal regu-lations and police offences.   As regardsWeihaiwei he was proposing that theChinese Government, if they are intenton eliminating all British interestsin the territory, should provide HisMajesty&apos;s Admiralty vith the facilitiesthey require at bob other port, andthat they should buy out the foreignproperty owners.     After commenting on.     , other points of detail it was pointedout in the Memorandum that the main objective.in vie? is the liquidation of those obligations which are now outof date and which have become a burdenrather than an advantage to us, butthat progress must necessarily be gradual and can Only be made par! passuwith the efforts of the Chinese toraise the standards of government and&apos;&quot; administration in their country to a level HiOre nearly comparable with ourown:.      The&apos; Report of a Cabinet Committee(Paper G.P.-27 (30)) covering a Reportby the Committee of Chiefs of Staff onthe subject of the Strength of theBritish Infantry GaJTison in China,the Conclusions of which were summarisedas follows:-
(a) &quot;,;e consider that the decision of theCabinet to withdraw a British infantry battalion in February 19 30 (Cabinet50 (29),  Conclusion 11) should stand.(h) We recommend that the Cabinet, shouldreaffirm the general policy that hashitherto been pursued of avoidingdispersion of the British militaryforces in China and of concentrating&quot;for the purpose o^ ensuring (i) thatthe Colony of Hong-Fong is adequatelyprotected:    (ii) that the garrison in Shanghai,  assisted by our own naval forces and the Shanghai Volunteers;should be adequate to deal with mobviolence:    and (iii) that our Legationin Peking and its communications withthe sea should be guarded in co-operation with the other &quot;Protocol&quot;troops.(c) &apos;ve recommend, that the Cabinet Shouldreaffirm the policy as regards the&apos;employment of military forces, whichis laid down- in the Foreign office telegram of the 4-th August, 1929,na?. ely, that,  although the use of force for other purposes is not abso-Tut ely excluded, the dominating cons id-eration is to be the protection of life.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported progress to the Cabinet on the various points.    The importance of a settle&apos; ent oh extra,-territorially had been emphasised by an incidentat Hankow, where a Naval Offieer,.after a motoraccident, had been arrested but subsequently released.Mr Henderson stated that His Maj esty&apos;.s Minister at peking had been instructed to present a note to theNanking Government containing the proposals of HisMajesty&apos;s Government for a solution o&quot;1&quot; the questionof extra-territorial rights on the lines indicatedin the Mea-or-indum, and. said that he v as now waitingthe result of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s action.    In themeantime a. not altogether, helpful development hadintervened as the United States Government had submitted a draft Agreement, to the Nanking Governmentwhich made concessions considerably in excess of what
His Majesty&apos;s Government,  in existing oircu; stances,were prepared to make.    In other respects develop-Bents had been encouraging.   In the matter of the shanghai Provisional Court and Weihaiwei, agreementshad been reached which disposed of these two important issues otitsta-commanding with the Chinese Government.    Asregards the Boxer Indemnity,  proposals for a settle-ment were now before the Nanking Government whichit was thought would provide a final solution.The Cabinet took note of the statementof the Secretary of State for Foreign-Affairs and approved the Conclusionsquoted above from the Report of theCabinet Committee fPaper CP.-27 (30)).
egypt .Anglo-egyptian treaty .(previous reference:Cabinet 5(30), Con-elusion 2.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a report to the Cabinet in regard to theforthcoming negotiations for an Egyptian settle-ment, which were likely to result in the arrival in London of an Egyptian deputation in the second week of March, or possibly a little earlier.   TheBritish High Commissioner was trying to arrange that Jfrgt^i^H. Pasha, whom Nahas Pasha desired tobring with him, should be present in London as an expert and not as a Delegate.
GRANTS TONECESSITOUSAREAS .(previous reference:Cabinet 54(29) .)3,, The Cabinet had before them a. Memorandum by theMinister of Labour (Paper CP.-37 (30)) suggesting that the stage has been reached when those men,chiefly young men, in the distressed areas who are unlikely to obtain work locally or   elsewhere without some course of re-conditioning or training but whorefuse to avail themselves of the offer of training,should have their benefit disallowed if they refuse,without good reason, to take a course o^ instructionwhen it is offered to them.   The Minister of Labourproposed to make, and lay on the Table of the Houseof Commons, a formal Regulation as to attendance atcourses o^ instruction amending previous regulations under the Unemployment Insurance Acts .There was general agreement that the word&quot;re-conditioning&quot; was open to objection in referenceto the unemployed and should be avoided in any officialdocument.    Subject to this, the Cabinet agreed  To approve the Minister of Labour&apos;proposal to lay on the Table of theHouse of Commons a formal Regulationas to attendance at courses of instruc-tion, amending certain existing Regula-tions under the Unemployment insurance acts .-4-
-   m; I4 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the minister of Health (Paper CP .-34: (30)) on the subject. Iof Poor Law Orders.    In view of the fact that onjlApril 1st Part I of the Local Government Act, 1929,comes into operation, involving the disappearance of boards of Guardians and the taking over of their functions by the County and County Borough Councils,and in accordance with an undertaking given by hispredecessors, the Minister has prepared a new and eom-plete consolidation of the Orders.   He has decided,for the present at any rate, to proceed at once withthe great bulk of a Dra^t Order which has been prepared,but reserves for the consideration of his colleagues the Section dealing with the regulation of relief toable-bodied persons, which is at present determined bythe Relief Regulation Order, 1911.   The alterations inthis Order which the Minister of Health proposes areas follows:-(l) entirely to omit the requirement of. institutional (or workhouse) relief which inspires the aduinistration inmany places and deters many who oughtto have relief from making applicationfor it:(2) to require every looal authority toprepare arrangements for conditionalout4.Q-Q&amp; relief:(3) to expand (on lines already practisedat such Unions as Salford and Poplar)the existing condition of a task ofwork so as to encourage the replacement of useless, deterrent tasks by instruc-tional classes (including classes for physical training):(4) to require that so far as the arrange-ments permit they shall be applied inall cases of outdoor relief to able-bodied men: and(5) to recognise the limits of practi-ability and leave to the Councils&apos;.. the responsibility of deciding how they will do their work of relievingdestitution where they cannot make arrangements adequate to cover thewhole of the able-bodied men relieved.
The powers of control which it is. proposed to reserve to the Minister- (apart from his pover to issue a specialOrder in any area for which he may think it desirableto do so) are:.-(l) the power to require a local authorityto -discontinue or amend its arrangementsfor work or training, and(2) the power to disapprove (so involinga liability to surcharge) relief granted in.a case in which the arrangementspermit of ^ork or training, but neitheris in fact required of the applicant.In addition, the Minister proposes to preserve theexisting discretion to afford unconditional relief incases of sickness.Copies of the Relief Regulation Order, 1911, and ofthe revised draft are attached to the Memoranda.Subject to co-ordination between the Ministry ofHealth and the Ministry of Labour, more particularlyin regard to training arrangements under the LocalAuthorities and the Ministry of Labour respectively, -The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Health as setforth in Paper CP .-34 (30): andsummaris ed above .
IpALESTINE. 5&apos;..The Cabinet had before them a Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (Paper CP.-36 (30))(previous reference: in regard to the situation in Palestine, prepared in cabinet $(30), Con-     accordance with the decision of the Cabinet referredcInsIon l.)to in.the margin, the Conclusions of which are summarisedas followst-(a) The disorders in August were largely dueto the lack of adequate preventativeforces in Palestine.(b) The forces now available in the country are the minimum which should be main-tained and, backed by the naval forces which now visit Palestine regularly,are, we consider, sufficient to dealwith all disturbances likely to occur in normal circumstances,(c) In the event of widespread trouble,reinforcements would be necessary;, andto meet such abnormal circumstances thearrangements referred to in paragraph 9have been concerted between the Depart-ments concerned.(d) We attach the highest importance to theexistence of an efficient police organ-isation, which alone can be in the positiongenerally to prevent trouble.   We strongly recommend that an independent and experi-experienced police official (^&quot;or example a highofficer of the Indian Police) should be nominated to investigate the situation.(e) We consider it of the utmost importance that an efficient intelligence department should be set up in Palestine, since early and accurate information of pending trouble is essential,  if the spread of disturbancesis to be prevented.Arising out of this Report, some discussion tookplace in regard to the general political situationin Palestine,  on which it was hoped that the commissioners-sloners who had undertaken the recent Inquiry would.be in a position to shed some information.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Report of the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee (Paper CP.-36 (30)),the Conclusions of whish are summarisedab ov e:(b) To take note that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies could not atpresent dispense with the regular visits
which,, in the interests of securityare being paid to Palestine portsby ships of His Majesty*s Navy:(c) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should, at hisearliest convenience, circulate to the Cabinet a report on thesituation, in Palestine (on whichhe might be able to obtain some information from the members of therecent Commission of Inquiry) and advise the Cabinet as to what their policy should be in regardto that mandated territory.
NAVAL stations in THE north atlantic ANDTFT7- west indies.(Pt ev 1 OTISPreference:Cabinet 4?(29), Con-clusionlSv)6( The Cabinet had before thai.,, a Report by theCommittee of Chiefs of Staff (Paper CP.-15 (30)),prepared in accordance with the decision of the cabinet referred to in the margin, on the subject of certain questions raised in the course of the Prime Minister^conversations with President Hoover last autumn,relating to Naval Stations in the North Atlantic and west Indies.   The Conclusions of the Report were summarised as follows:-.(a) Bermuda and Jamaica,  our existing NavalStations, possess defences on so low a scale, and naval facilities so limited,that,  even if they were maintained at full establishment, they cannot by anystretch of imagination be justifiablyregarded as a menace, actual or potentialities-tial, to the United States or to anyo th e-r o ount ry .at pres ent on abasis&quot;.   Fivftn idefenceswith those o^or toThe def ences are,. however er,&quot;care and maintenanceEven v-hen fully manned, theof these ports, as comparedthe A&amp;erioan naval bases in the Atlantic, are almost negligible.(b) In considering the policy of whether astatement is to be made or not, we ask that His Majesty&apos;s Government will bear the following considerations in mind:-(i). That, in the event of war with anymaritime Power, adequately defendedbases for vessels employed on pro-tec t ion of ou- trade would be indis-pensable.(ii) That, in acceding to president hoover&apos;s demand in the case ofour Possessions in North Americaand the &quot;;?est Indies,will be set up whichhighly   -inconvenient in relationa precedentmight, prove to other Power?the world, e.gin other parts ofthe Mediterranean..(iii)effect of the DeclarationWest Indian Colonies.

in our opinion,  sufficiently providedfor in the draft declaration quoted inparagraph 3,  should specifically be safeguarded, viz.:-(i) That, while there is not the smallestintention to create a menace to theUnited States of America, we must reserve the right to bring the equipment of the existing dockyards,defences and garrison up to date,including the provision,  from timeto time, of such new weapons ormethods as may be devised, and thatthe same principle must apply toany new naval,, military or a,lrestablishment which,  at soiree futureday, might be required in connectionwith our general arrangements for defence.Cii) Measures regarded as necessary for bringing our defensive arrangementsup to date,  even if they are longpostponed, must not be treated asa. breach of our undertaking not tocreate a menace to the United Statesof America.It was pointed out to the Cabinet that theConclusions  of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-committee did not provide material for a statement which was likely to prove acceptable to the United States ofAmerica.   Up to the present time, however, thequestion had not been raised at the Naval Conference.. Attention was called to the passages in theReport  fparagraphs 33 to 35) relating to the mainten-ance of naval bases  in the West Indies by Prance and holland.The Cabinet agreed 1 That the First Lord of the admiralty should discuss the matter further with the Board of Adooiralty .
