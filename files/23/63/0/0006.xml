In the course of the discussion which followedattention was drawn to the probability that thesituation would become worse before it became better,to the immediate effects of rationalisation in adding to unemployment, and to difficulties arising out ofthe fiscal policies of the Dominions.    Emphasis was laid on the importance of distinguishing between the varying repercussions of financial expenditure onrelief, on schemes offering immediate productiveresults, and on long range schemes of reconstructionthe resultant economies of which would not be visiblefor some time, possibly not for two&apos;years or more.It was generally agreed that policies of additionalunproductive relief should be strongly discouraged.The suggestion was made that it might become necessaryto introduce legislation which would enable thecentral government to override the obstacles whichplebiscites In some localities were offering in opposition to the decision of Councils to promoteschemes, valuable in themselves and helpful indealing with the present emergency.Cabinet 23 Reference was also made to the alleged failure(29)Conclusion 3. to secure satisfactory co-operation in theadministrative arrangements for dealing with unemployment.The Cabinet agreed:-(a)    To authorise the Lord Privy Seal tomake a statement in the House OfCommons that afternoon on the linesof his report to the Cabinet, includingthe censure of those members of all parties,&quot; who were blocking Bills anddelaying schemes which would affordemployment.
