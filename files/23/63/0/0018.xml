The first point onwhich the Secretary of State inhis Memorandum asked for a decision was as to whether a fresh pronounce-ment should be made after enquiry by anew Commission to report upon major questions of policy,  or, altejrna-tively,  forthwith in the light ofthe imaterial already available.He was himself disposed to dispense with further enquiry.elusion bCo).)In this, event he pointed outthat there were three points thatcall for early consideration, viz.:-(i) The Arab deaand for some formof representative institutions:(ii) The regulation of immigration:(iii) The protection of evictedcultivators.The Secretary of State for the Colonies read the draft of a statement which it was proposedthat the Prime Minister should make in the Houseof Commons in answer to a Question.

THE SEA 12. The Cabinet had under consideration aFISHERIESREGULATION Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and(EXPENSES)BILL.&apos; Fisheries (Paper H.A.-12 ( SO)) covering the draftSea Fisheries Regulation (Expenses) Bill, whiohis designed to rectify an anomaly which, has arisenas a result of the passage of the Local Government-Act, 1929, under which the travelling expensesof members of the majority of the Sea FisheriesCommittee may be paid out o^ County funds .   this authority, however, does not extend&apos;to the sea fisheries Committees for Cornwall, Kent andLindsey, and the object of the Bill is to extend the authority to all the Committees,   togetherwith, the recommendation of the Committee of HomeAffairs thereon (H..A..C. Sth Conclusions (30),Para.3).The Oabinet agreed  To approve the introduction inthe House of Commons of the sea fisheries Regulation (Expenses)Bill, in the form of the draft annexed to Paper E.A.-I3 (-3D),on the understanding that thefurther progress of the Bill must depend upon the exigencies of the e Pa&quot;v liam ent ary . t ime-1 a &quot;pi e.

As a result of this protection the grey seal has increased in numbers and is nowin no immediate danger o* exteri ination if protec-tion is removed.   Nevertheless It appears desirableto legislate so that the position maybe regulatedfrom time to time as circumstances require, andit is accordingly proposed in the Fill to maintainprotection, but with a power to the Minister orthe Secretary of State for Scotland, as the case may be, to modify or withdraw (wholly or partly)such protection in any particular year.In accordance with the recommendation of theCommittee of Rome Affairs  (H.A.C. 5th Conclusions(30), Para .4), the Cabinet agreed  To approve the introduction in theHouse of Commons of the Grey Seals(Protection) Bill in the form ofthe draft annexed to Paper H.A.-14(30), on the understanding that thefurther progress of the Bill must depend on the exigencies o^ theParliamentary time-table.
the WORLDT SPAIR ATCHICAGO.(previous reference:Cabinet 2(29) , Con-clusion 7.)14.   The Cabinet were informed that theAmerican Ambassador, General Dawes, was interested in the World&apos;s Pair at Chicago andwrould be gratified if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould arrange for British participation.    This,however, would be a breac^fi^lne^^on^intion- of paris of the 22nd November, 1928, which, though not yet ratified, had been signed by the british representatives, and the object of which was to restrict the number.of International Exhibitions.Further, participation in the Chicago World&apos;s .Fair Would involve us inevitably in participation in the French Colonial Exhibition next year.    no substantial trade was likely to result from suchparticipation, and the question therefore turnedon political considerations.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should inform theAmerican Ambassador of thedifficulties of participation,more particularly those arisingout of the Convention of Parisof November 22, 1928.    He should ascertain particulars of the desire that General Dawes had expressedfor certain British railway loco-motives to be sent to the Exhibitionin order to illustrate progress inthis b-ranch of industry.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,,April 2,  19 30.
APPENDIX.. His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to administerPalestine in accordance with the terms of the Mandate as approved by the Council of the League of nations.      Thatis an international obligation from which there canbe no Question of receding.Under the terms of the Mandate His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are responsible for promoting &quot;the establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people,it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which might prejuduse the civil and religious rightsof existing non-Jewish com unities in Palestine or therights and political status enjoyed, by Jews in anyother countrjr&quot;.A double undertaking is involved, to the Jewishpeople on the one hand, and to the non-Jewish populationof Palestine on the other;    end it is the firm resolve ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to give effect, in equal measure,to both parts of the Declaration and to do. equal justice to all sections of. the populations of Palestine.      Thatis a; duty from which they will not shrink, and. tothe discharge of which they will apply all the resources at their command.The report of the Shaw Commission, which is in thehands of Honourable Members., covers a wide field.      TheCommission was appointed to consider the immediatecauses of the deplorable disturbances of.-august last, andto suggest means of preventing a recurrence.      Inendeavouring faithfully to carry out the terms of reference,the Commission must have found it difficult to draw lines
very rigidly,,      The Government is now studying thevarious recommendations of the Commission wj.th aview to dealing with the imme diate causes of theoutbreak, ;\nd to preventing a recurrence, and is inconsultation with the interests concerned.
