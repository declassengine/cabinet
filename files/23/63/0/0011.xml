retirement pensions.(previous reference:Cabinet 1fSO), Con-elusion 4e)G-ENFRA1 SURREYOP national insurance ANDPENSIONSSCHEMES.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(29)    Con*-clusion 5(a) ,)2. Arising out of the disoussion referred to inthe previous Conclusion, the Cabinet were informedthat in various quarters enquiry was being&quot; made asto why the Government had not adopted a scheme ^orRetirement Pensions.    Two suggestions were made inregard to the nature of the reply that could begiven by Ministers to whom such enquiries wereaddressed:    (i) that the matter had been considered and that the proposal    was      not    adopted becausethe position of affairs had been found to be such that unemployment might not be reduced but increasedby the proposal;    (ii) that the reply should be tothe effect that the question of Retirement Pensionswas really part of the whole question of national insurance and Pensions Schemes which were at present under review by a special Cabinet Committee.
3. The attention of the Cabinet was called tothe public interest being shown, by means of questions in Parliament, Suppler, entariee, articles in the Press,  and so forth,  on the subject of the alleged religious persecution in Russia -The Secretary or State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinet on the information he hadreceived from the British Ambassador.    He consultedhis   colleagues as to the attitude he should, taketowards the requests being made for the publicationof the Ambassador *s reports.The Cabinet agreedfa) That,  as a matter of principle,the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should resist demands forthe publication 0&quot; the Despatchesalready received from the Ambassador,which were written for the confidential -tial information of His FaiestyrsGovernment:ft) That he should reserve his decision in regard to the publication of areport from the Ambassador which isnow on its y.ay,  and which it isanticipated may be more suitablefor publication, until he hasreceived it:(c) That, in view of the politicalcomplexion which the question ofalleged persecution in Russia hasassumed, it would be undesirable that Intercessory Prayers shouldbe read at religious Services ofthe Navy, Army and Air Force,,
INDIA. 4.  The Cabinet had before them the followingFISCAL POLICY.       documents in regard to the IndianT3otton TariffTAXATION OF proposals :-COTTON IMPORTS,A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (Paper C ,P .-49 (30))(Previous covering a telegram from the ViceroyReference: stating that the Government of IndiaCabinet 9 are deeply impressed by the telegram(30), Con- transmitting the Cabinet &apos;s decision-elusion 2.) referred to in the margin, butstating that there are insuperable difficulties In modifying their plan on the lines suggested,  and givingdetails.   The telegram contained an offer to propose to the LegislativeAssembly that    in addition to a15 per cent. Revenue Duty, a 5 percent Protective Duty, with a minimum of 3% annas per pound, should be imposed on plain grey goods from outside the Empire.   The ProtectiveDuty would be proposed for threeyears only, before the end of whichit would be examined by the tariff board.    It was made clear that theGovernment of India could not go sofar as to force this measure throughagainst a strong unofficial opposition in the Assembly and that they wouldhave to be guided by general indiea-tions of public opinion.    If the suggested course were adopted, theViceroy proposed that the facts ofHis Majesty&apos;&apos;s Governments approach to the Government of India and oftheir previous proposals and ultimateresponse should be fully and franklyexplained in the Indian Budget Speech.He deprecated   however, the actualpublication or the telegrams exchanged:A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (Paper C.P.-51 (30))reluctantly admitting that the grounds on which the Government of India&apos;decision to increase the Indian CottonDuties generally are based are diffi-cult to controvert;    and warmly welcom-ing the proposal that the specialprotective Duty to be placed in theinterests of the Bombay millownerson plain grey goods should only applyto imports from outside the BritishEmpire.   The suggestion was made thatappreciation should be expressed ofthe consideration given by the Govern-ment of India to the Cabinet&apos;s views,and particularly of their readiness tosubmit to the Legislature a proposal of this almost unprecedented&apos; character.It was pointed out, however, that theactual effect of the proposed specialsurtax on Lancashire Interests mustnot be exaggerated.
The Cabinet approved generally the action proposed in theViceroy&apos;s telegram.-5-

The main object of this Bill is to prohibitchildren under 15 living in or travelling on acanal boat.    In his Memorandum the Minister ofHealth suggested that, in vie?   of the general feeling manifested in the Debate in favour of themain objects underlying the Pill, he should beauthorised to state that the Government would do their best to find time for the later stages of theBill, provided that its promoters would accept a compromise on the lines of the main recommendationsof the Report of the Committee on Canal Boats,  namely,that children o^ school age should be prohibited fromliving in canal boats during the term times of the schools which they are attending.The Minister of Health was asked to make itclear to the House of Commons that the further stages of the Bill must depend upon the state ofctn (3.business in Parliament y that there are a number of bills of equal merit.

It was statedthat a similar resolution was passed independentlyby the National Council of Agriculture for Englandon the 6th February,    In these circumstances, theCabinet were invited to re-consider their decisionof July last,    Leaving flour out of account, in viewof the recent decision or the &quot;ar Office to useEnglish flour for other than bread-making wherever possible,  the Minister of Agriculturefs proposal wasthat home-killed fresh beef should be supplied forthe six months October to March,  or,  alternatively,to revert to the pre-War practice of fresh beef for four days per week but for six months only,  thus reducing the extra cost from  245,000 to  163,000,He further suggested that means  should be devised to overcome the objection of the Service departments to be-ring on their Votes the cost of an agriculturalconcession.   He suggested also that beef corresponding to National Mark Grades might be&apos; specified,  and that supplies should bear&apos; the stamp of the .local SanitaryAuthority, as provided in Regulation XV&quot; of the PublicHealth ( Meat) Regulations,   1*24.
In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to the fact that the present proposals appliedto &quot;horne-killed&quot; and not to &quot;horne-fedM beef, whichmight tend to benefit the Irish Free State as muchas the United Kingdom agricultural interests.Suggestions were made that, before the proposal couldbe considered, the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries would have to convince the Service Depart-ments that they would be able to obtain their meatat a good price and at the tiroes when they requiredit,  and to give all details:    also that a detailed statement ? ight with advantage be drawn up for publication giving the reasons for the rejection ofthe proposal, as set forth in previous Cabinet Papers.Strong financial and economic objections were urgedagainst the proposal, which,  in consequence^ was not adopted by the Cabinet,
