The Cabinet had before them aMemorandum (CP. 127(30)) dealing with, theproposed Anglo-Egyptian Treaty showing in parallel columns the Articles agreed with(Previous the Egyptian Delegation now in London, the reference:Cabinet 21(30) Treaty Proposals of 1929, and lines on conclusion l).which agreement in principle has beenLocationof Troops,reached or appears ^likely to be reached.Attached to the Memorandum was a Counter-draft to the Egyptian note on the Sudan.These documents, which were circulatedto the Cabinet at the opening of the meetingon grounds of urgency, were considered indetail by the Cabinet, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the othermembers of the British Delegation calling attention to the more important changes proposed (Appendix).Article 9.    The British Draft contained thewords? &quot;the high contracting parties agreethat&quot;;    the Egyptians pressed for theiromission.The Cabinet agreed:-That the words &quot;the highcontracting parties agree that&quot;must be retained.Employment of Article 10. The Egyptians refuse to acceptForeignOfficials. this Article or to admit the principle which it embodies.The Cabinet agreed:&apos;-That the British delegation should endeavour to give effectto Article 10 by aeans of a reference in a Note,
Capitulations. Artiole II.      The Egyptians had promised to produoe a Note on thissubject but had not yet done so.      their view was that the British Governmentshould terminate the present capitulatoryregime and they would thus be enabled to use this agreement to force the hands ofthe other foreign Powers,      This would leave British nationals unprotected.The Cabinet agreed r-To adhere to the inclusion in theTreaty of a provision for termina-ting the capitulatory regime solong as it was not made operativeuntil a similar agreement had beenreached between the Egyptians andthe other foreign Powers.Sudan. Article 13.    The Egyptians had accepted this draft Article but had accompanied it with a proposed Note on the -Sudan (printedon page 8 of the Memorandum) which had been strongly resisted by the British Delegationas definitely in&amp;cceptable.      An alternativedraft had been prepared for the considerationof the Cabinet, which had not been agreed by the British Delegation nor shown to the egyptians.Special attention was directed to thepossible implications of the grant of equaltreatment to British subjects and EgyptianNationals in matters of commerce, emigration,and the possession of property.
The Cabinet agreed - To approve the Counter-draft in substance and as a basisof negotiation and subject tothe Secretary of State forForeign Affairs telegraphingimmediately for the opinion of theGovernor-General of the Sudanupon it.Article 16.    It was pointed out that a reference to the League of Nations incase of disagreement had been acceptedby the British Delegation and satisfactory arrangements made for securing the duration of the Treaty.Subject to the foregoing the cabinet agreed  (a) That the British delegation should have authority to complete and sign the Anglo-egyptian treaty ;(b) That in the event of the treaty negotiations being concluded intime the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should beauthorised to put the positionreached before the House ofCommons before the adjournment;(c) That the British ratification of the Treaty should take place after the Egyptian ratification.

The Cabinet had before them aINDUSTRIALEMPLOYMENT Memorandum by the Minister of LabourBILL.(Paper H.A. 18(30)) covering the draftHours of Industrial Employment bill aMemorandum explanatory of the provisionsof the Bill, together with the recommen-dations of the Committee of Home affairs thereon (H.A.C. 8th Conclusions (30)).The Cabinet had also before them aMemorandum by the Minister of Labour(CP. 124(30) ) asking for authority tointroduce the Bill at once inasmuch asa meeting of the Governing Body of theInternational Labour Office was due to beheld on April 24th next.THE ATTORNEY^GENERAL summarised thechief provisions of the Bill and statedthat in his opinion, in which he was supportedby eminent Counsel, the Bill could fairly besaid to have &quot;been drafted so as to enable his Majesty&apos;8 Government to ratify the.Washington Hours Convention.   He invited the special attention of the Cabinet to the specific oases in which the working b  excesstime was permitted and to the difficultiesconnected with railwaymen and miners.     he offered no opinion on the legal effect of thewords &quot;pressure of work&quot; as applied tor&amp;ilwaymen&apos;s employment on Sundays.    The
matter was not free from doubt, but if thewords were altered and made definitethere would then arise a doubt whether theBill as thus altered could be regarded ascarrying out the Convention.     In thisdilemma he asked for the directions of theCabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER emphasised the thirdRecommendation of the Conclusions of the HomeAffairs Committee (H.A.C. 8th Conclusions (30))which read as follows:-&quot;To draw the special attention of theCabinet to the necessity of resistingany amendments to the Bill whichmight imperil ratification.&quot;The Cabinet were reminded of theimportance of post-dating the&quot; passage of thiisBill in relation to the coming into effectof the change of hours to 7-^- and one windingtime in the Coal Mines Bill.The Cabinet agreed --(a) To approve the introduction inthe House of Commons of the Hoursof Industrial Employment Billin the form of the draft annexed to H.A.  18(30) subject to any drafting or other minor alteratiothat may be found necessary or desirable;(b) To accept no amendments of substance on important legal-points without consultation withthe Law Officers;(c) To give no pledge as to the /further course of the Bill in IParliament, I

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL presented the Reportof the Meeting of the Economic Advisory Council,and said the question which the Cabinet had todecide was whether or not it would issue alicense for the construction of the Tunnel and on what conditions.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinetthat he had referred the Report of the PeacockCommittee to the Committee of Imperial defence for examination and reminded the Cabinet oftheir undertaking that they would not allowmilitary to override economic considerations.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that had regard to a situation in which the balance ofeconomic advantages was convincingly in favourof construction.
