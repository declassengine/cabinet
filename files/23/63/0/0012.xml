In addition, at ten-tion was drawn to concrete suggestions containedin the Report for the disposal of Sheerness Dock-yard and for the setting up of a Committee toconsider whether a scheme for getting rid of oldBritish tonnage is desirable, and,  if so, what form it should take.The Cabinet took note that,  for the timebeing, the Joint Committee referred to abovehad agreed to discuss the matter with the FirstLord of the Admiraltyj
