2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA informed the Cabinet, which had been summoned at short notice, that the Budget of the Government of india for 1930-31 includes the following taxationproposals:-(a) to raise the import duty on cottonpiecegoods from 11$ to 15-;&apos;;, ad valorem;(b) to impose a minimum specific duty of3-5- annas per pound on plain grey cotton goods - that is,  to levy on such goodseither 15$ ad valorem or 3-g- annas perpound, whichever is greater.The Secretary of State summarised the recenthistory of the question and promised to circulate a memorandum (C.P. 39(30)).      He called theattention of the Cabinet to the serious deficitwith which the Indian Budget was faced,  to the weakness of India&apos;a credit position, and to thefact that India now enjoyed full fiscal autonomyand could therefore not be prevented fromimposing duties for revenue or for protective purposes.      This right to economic libertyhad been recognised by the Joint Select Committeeon the Government of India Bill 1919 and had sindebeen publicly acknowledged by statesmen of all parties.      Mr. Benn urged that it was impossible togo back upon that position and that throughout theconsideration of the subject before the Cabinet he must insist upon his position as   guardian of theinterests of India,  and the Cabinet must observe theconvention of fiscal freedom.      He deplored the damage that would result to the trade of Lancashireby the increase of import duties though it was possibleto exaggerate the damage.      1%. must be borne itt mind
that for several years past  the position of thecotton industry in India had been very bad and within the last few weeks several mills had been closed and thousands of workpeople discharged.      Forsome time past other general duties in india had been at the rate of 15% and cotton at therate of 11$ had until now enjoyed what amountedto a 4)1 preference.In the course of a full discussion attentioiiwas called to the grave position of the lancashire cotton Industry and to the desirability of representing this position to the Viceroy.Precedents for this course were quoted and thefollowing passage from the memorandum of theSecretary of State for India was read and emphasised:&quot;In the working of the convention theGovernment of India arc required to consult the Secretary of State before placing proposals before the Legislature, but on these proposals the Secretary of State has not issuedinstructions - he has merely offeredobservations.      If, after considering hisobservations    the Government of Indiastill desired to place their proposals beforethe Legislature, they have been left free todo so.      If, in such circumstances,    theproposals are accepted by the Legislature,the Convention comes into operation and theSecretary of State doeghot intervene.&quot;It was held to be clearly within the right of thePrime Minister and the Cabinet to make representations to the Viceroy and fully recognised that when such&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos; &apos;   &apos; &apos; &quot;; ,representation had been made and had been consideredby the&apos; Government  of India the final decision would rest with that Government when in accord with theirLegislature.The Secretary of State for India said thathe conceived it to be his duty to look at the matter
from the standpoint of India and with a view toadvancing the interests of India. That,in his opinion, was fundamental.      lie was notthereby precluded from transmitting to the Viceroythe views of the Cabinet but it was vital thathe should in all respects loyally observe theConvention of 1919.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Viceroy should be informed of the present very serious conditionof the Lancashire cotton trade and thevery fullest possible statement shouldbe made to the Viceroy of the adverse effects upon that trade of the proposed increase of cotton import duties.(b) That the telegram should be drafted by the Secretary of State for India,the Secretary-of State for ForeignAffairs,  and the Lord Chancellor, for transmission by the Secretary of Statefor India on behalf of the Cabinet.( Noie.    The telegram as sent isattached as an Appendix tothese Minutes.)Z Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.7th February 1930.
APPENDIX.Telegram to the Government of India.With reference to the proposed increase ofthe Indian cotton duties, the Cabinet, at a special meeting held this morning, resolved that it would notbe inconsistent with the procedure governing the now well recognised Fiscal Autonomy Covention to make, atthis stage, the following representations to theGovernment of India.First, the probability that such an additionalduty would be likely to raise the price of goods InIndia itself to the great detriment of the poorerclasses generally in that country: and secondly,the probability that such an additional duty wouldhave a disastrous effect in England at this moment -an effect which the Cabinet feels sure that you and your Legislature do not desire to create.From both points of view the Cabinet views with the gravest apprehension the proposed additionalduty and trusts that full weight will be given to theabove considerations./l   Mote  :-    Terms approved by The Prime Minister,the Lord Chancellor and The Foreign Secretary.(Intld.)
