10     THE PRIME MINISTER asked the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to give a resume of events during the last two daysQTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFIAIPSreminded his colleagues that, when the Cabinet had met on Monday, they had been waiting for the reply from the Czechoslovak Government.,On Tuesday morning an unofficialstatement had been issued to the effect that the czechoslovak Government proposed to accept the jointBritish and French proposals.     Messages receivedfrom Paris at about the same time indicated that considerable pressure was being brought to bear onthe French Government, whose position had appearedsomewhat insecure-.No definite answer was received from czechoslovakia until late on Tuesday evening.About half-past ten he had received from our minister at Prague a short resume of the czechoslovak Government&apos;s reply (cee telegramNo. 664 from Prague),A little earlier a communication had beenreceived from the French Ambassador to the effectthat there was a further concentration of german troops on the Czechoslovak frontier. The french were greatly concerned at this news, and thoughtthat it would be difficult for them to maintain their advice to the Czechoslovak Government not to mobilise, unless at the same time we continued toput great pressure on Dro Benes to accept the jointFrench and British proposals.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that late on Tuesday night, after consultation
with the Prime Minister, he had sent a further telegram to Prague (No. 315) urging the czechoslovak government to reconsider their attitude. &apos;   the concluding paragraph of this telegram had been to theeffect that if, on reconsideration,- the CzechGovernment felt hound to reject our advice, theymust of course he free to take any action they thoughtappropriate to meet the situation that mightthereafter develop.Telegram No0 670 had now been received fromPrague.     This telegram contained a personal and preliminary message from Dr. Hodza^s private secretary to the effect that the czechoslovak government accepted the French and British proposals and that an official reply would be sent as soon aspossible.In the meantime, we were running a considerablerisk that the situation would get out of hand, if steps were not taken to confirm the date for the resumptionof the Prime Minister&apos;s conversations with Herr Hitler.On Tuesday, the German Government had become somewhatrestive as to the failure to fix the date and time forthe Prime Minister&apos;s return.     Sir Nevile Hendersonhad reported that the position might get out of handunless the date of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit was definitely fixed.     He had temporised for half a day,but Sir Nevile. Henderson had returned to the charge andhad stated that Herr Hitler had made arrangements to gofrom Berchtesgaden to Bad Godesberg and wanted earlyconfirmation of the arrangements.     Herr Hitler had proposed that the meeting should be definitely fixed for Thursday morning.
It had been felt that the situation made it necessary to fix a definite date, and a message had therefore been sent late on Tuesday agreeing to the resumption of the conversations on Thursday.    This hadinvolved some risk, in view of the uncertainty as to theattitude of the Czechoslovak Government.    But the positionin this respect was somewhat eased by recent telegrams from Prague.In reply to the Secretary of State for Air, theForeign Secretary said that he had received a visit fromthe Hungarian Minister last night on the subject of minorities..    The Hungarian Minister had said that Hungary&apos;claim was overwhelming,  and that they had behaved withgreat moderation, for which they should not be penalised...The Foreign Secretary said that he had repliedon the lines that His Majesty&apos;s Government were at presentengrossed in other problems.    That, however, did not mean that any claim which the Hungarians might make would notbe given due consideration, if it were raised at theappropriate time.    For the time being he took note ofthe Hungarian Minister&apos;s statement   (See telegram No.67 toBudapest).The Polish Minister was coming to see him that evening in regard to the Polish claim, and he proposedto reply on the same lines.    It was. noticeable that thePoles were somewhat more truculent * and that statements hadbeen made to the effect that, unless their claim for thereturn of Teschen was immediately recognised, the irrelations with the Czechoslovak Government would becomestrained.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had nothing.to add to the Secretary of State&apos;s resume of events, except
perhaps to call attention to telegram No-668 from Prague,which indicated that the Czechoslovak Government hardlyanticipated that their first answer to the French andBritish proposals would be accepted, and expected that further pressure would be brought to bear upon them.There were certain matters which were likelyto arise at an early stage of his conversation with herr Hitler, and he welcomed the opportunity of discussing them with his colleagues.OTHER The question of minorities in Czechoslovakia,.MINORITIES.other than the Sudeten Germans, had been mentioned in his first talk with Herr Hitler,  and the latter had said thathe was not interested in them.    If Herr Hitler maintained that attitude, these minorities should not present any immediate difficulty.    But representatives of hungary and Poland had both visited Berchtesgaden in the last few days, and we had no very precise account of&quot;what had passed.    It was possible that Herr Hitler would nowsay that, since his first meeting with the Prime Minister,he had been approached by these other two countries;that their position in regard to minorities was the sameas Germany&apos;s; and that he could not reach a settlement onthe Sudeten German question unless the position of the hungarian and Polish minorities in Czechoslovakia wasalso settled.    He did not think that Herr* Hitler was likely to take up this attitude.    Nevertheless, he hadto consider what answer should be made to such a demand.
The Prime Minister said that, if Herr Hitlermade any such demand, he proposed to say that it   was inconsistent   with what the Ftlhrer had said to him at his first interview, when he   had asked him(the   Prime Minister) to deal with the particular problem&apos; of the Sudeten Germans.     His attitude would be that the settlement of the Sudeten Germanquestion could   not be made dependent upon thesettlement of other quite different questions which didnot concern Herr Hitler.      If Herr Hitler still adhered to the attitude that he must have an immediate settlementof the Hungarian and Polish Minority questions thePrime Minister proposed to say that he was unable to *proceed further on the matter, and must return home to consult his colleagues,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME affairs thought that this issue would be a test of Herr Hitler&apos;ssincerity.     He thought that the Prime minister should stand firm by the line of action which he proposed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN&quot; affairs said that he would like to make quite clear what hemeant by giving consideration, at a later date, tothe claims   on behalf of the Hungarian and polishMinorities.     The claims on behalf of these Minoritiesinvolved the revision of the Treaties concerned, and article 19 of the Covenant made provision for suchrevision.     There was a good deal to be said for   the revision of the Treaties by proper methods, provided it was not linked up with threats.     He -agreed that thePrime Minister should   refuse to yield to pressure from Herr Hitler to agree to an immediate settlementof these other Minority questions.
The question of Minorities was also linked up with our proposed guarantee.     In guaranteeingthe boundaries of Czechoslovakia the foreign secretary said that he did not preclude considerationof the revision of those boundaries in a proper manner.The guarantee was directed against unprovoked aggression.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE colonies said that he was in agreement with the Home Secretary.He thought that, if Herr Hitler pressed for animmediate settlement of these claims, it would showthat his interests lay, not in the German race, butin an attempt to dominate Europe.In the course of discussion, generalagreement was expressed with these views.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had verylittle sympathy with the claims now being putforward by Hungary and Poland.     Before the warno nation had treated their Minorities worse thanthe Magyars and since the war none had treated theirMinorities worse than the Poles.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed withthe views expressed by his colleagues.     When hesaid that if Herr Hitler persisted in the linesuggested, he would find it necessary to consult his colleagues, he had it in mind that circumstances might arise, such as the necessity for giving a warningin Prague, which might make it necessary for him to  jplay for time.The Cabinet agreed with the course proposed by the prime Minister.       /
THE PROPOSED THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were two mainGUARANTEE,questions to be considered in regard to-the proposed guarantee, First, should the guarantee be joint orseveral?       Secondly, which Powers should he guarantors?In regard to the first question, examination onlystrengthened the case against a several guarantee.Every nation, except ourselves, might run out and leave us to bear the whole burden.     The guarantee was against&quot;unprovoked aggression&quot;.     Who was to determine whethera particular case constituted &quot;unprovoked aggression&quot; ?If each of the guarantor Powers was to decide thisquestion for itself, then each of the guarantor powers would in effect have the right to determine whether theguarantee operated in a particular case.It was therefore felt that the right plan was tohave a joint guarantee, and to provide for a meetingof the guarantors to decide in any particular casewhether &quot;unprovoked aggression&quot; had taken place,ThQ inclusion in the guarantee of a provision on theselines had a considerable bearing on the question of whichPowers should become guarantors.       The. idea first putforward had been that Germany should be one of thejoint guarantors;    but if that course were adopted,and if Germany took the view that in a particular casethe aggression had been provoked, this would enable her.to exercise a free veto on the operation of thejoint guarantee, and to make it ineffective.     We didnot, however, wish to leave Germany out of the picture,and it was therefore proposed to invite Germany to sign a separate pact of non-aggression with Czechoslovakia.
Germany being thus excluded from the joint guarantee, what other Powers remained?     It was proposed that the joint guarantors should consistof Prance, ourselves and Russia,,     The PrimeMinister referred, in this connection, to the pro-vision in paragraph 6 of the joint message from theFrench and British Governments (Telegram No. 300)to the effect that it was proposed to substitute a general guarantee against unprovoked aggression in place of existing Treaties which involved recip-rocai obligations of a military character.     the treaties between France and Czechoslovakia and between Russia and Czechoslovakia both involvedreciprocal obligations, and it was proposed that theFrench should invite Russia to follow France&apos;sexample and to modify her Treaty with Czechoslovakiato conform with the arrangement   now proposed.       Itwas possible that Russia might refuse to agree to thisarrangement, but she should be invited to do so.What attitude would Herr Hitler take to theproposal that these three Powers should be jointguarantors?        He had said that he regardedCzechoslovakia as a spearhead in German territory.It was a fair answer to this to say that in futureCzechoslovakia would not be entitled to sign anyTreaties with reciprocal military obligations^.     ThePrime Minister asked? however, what line he should take if Herr Hitler objected to Russia guaranteeingCzechoslovakia against unprovoked aggression.      Sofar as he could see, such a guarantee was unobjec-tionable from Herr Hitler&apos;s point of view, unless he intended to commit an act of unprovoked aggression against Czechoslovakia and wished to destroy it,
The Prime Minister therefore proposed that ifHerr Hitler raised objection to Russia being one ofthe joint guarantors he should refer the matter tothe Cabinet before reaching a decision.The Prime Minister next dealt with the possibilityof other Powers being guarantors.     For many reasonshe would have liked to have included Italy.    The Berlin-Rome axis might not always be as strong as it wasto-dayo     Again, it must be remembered that   we weredealing with individuals whose actions were affected by various motives;    and for many reasons it might havebeen helpful to have brought Signor Mussolini into the picture.     But the same reasons which told against theinclusion of Germany in the joint guarantee we?re in his view decisive against the inclusion of Italy.The inclusion of other neighbouring Powers had alsobeen considered, for example, Poland, Hungary and roumania.     There was something to be said for theinclusion of these Powers but, having regard to theirminority questions, their inclusion in the presentguarantee must, he thought, be ruled out.The Prime Minister therefore proposed that thejoint guarantors should be Prance, this country and russia, if she was willing, and that Germany should beinvited to sign a separate pact of non-aggression withCzechoslovakia.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtit might be desirable to consider two further questions.First, whether it was desirable to include yugoslavia and Roumaniao     These countries had no minority
questions which directly affected Czechoslovakia.Their inclusion was, however, open to the disadvantagethat,    the larger the number of Powers included, theless effective an instrument the joint guarantee might become.The second point was whether it was possible,while not including Italy in the position of one of thejoint guarantors, to include her in some secondarycapacity, so as not to leave her out of the picturealtogether.In the course of the discussion which ensued therewas general agreement in favour of including russians a guarantor.THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out that, if theguarantee had to be implemented, Russia might provideuseful help, that it was a mistake to take action whichtended to put Russia out of Europe and that the inclusionof Russia would be helpful from the point of view ofcertain sections ofpublic opinion in this country. \,On the free veto point the LORD CHANCELLORpointed out that a   joint guarantee could be drafted insuch terms that, if one of the. joint guarantors committed an act of aggression,    the remaining Powers should actas though the Power which had committed the aggressionwas not a guarantor, i.e. the vote of the aggressorPower would be disregarded.
It was pointed out, however, that the act of aggression might he committed, not by Germany, but bysome other Power, say Hungary, and that Germany might take the view that Hungary1s action did not constitutedunprovoked aggression.     To meet a contingency of thiskind it was suggested that provision might be madefor majority decisions.     Circumstances might, however,arise in which such a provision would operate against this country;   that is to say, that this country might find itself in the minority, out-voted by the votes of other countries.     It was impossible forthis country to put itself in a position in whichwe should not have the last word on the issues ofpeace and war..It was also pointed out that, in the eventof aggression by Germany against Czechoslovakia,.Prance, Russia and this country were the three countries which could most effectively put a curbon Germany1 s ambitions, and that there was thereforemuch to be said for having these three Powers only as joint guarantors.As regards the argument that Germany might think that some slur was put upon her by failure to include her as a guarantor, it was pointed outthat there was almost certainly no prospect of persuading Germany to sign a document which was alsosigned by.Russia.     Germany&apos;s dislike of multilateralpacts was also referred to.
Some discussion took place on the foreign secretary&apos;s suggestion that some of the minorPowers should he included as guarantors, say,Yugoslavia and Roumania0Reference was made to the existing obligationsbetween the Little Entente Powers.     It was feltthat this was a matter which those Powers shouldsettle among themselves and that it need not bebrought up in the discussions with Herr Hitler.The view was also expressed that any attemptto include Italy with some of the minor Powers,such as Yugoslavia and Roumania, would be resented by Italy.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, whileagreeing with the desirability of including some of the limitrophe Powers In the joint guarantee, thought that it would be impossibleto bring this about until the question of theirminorities in Czechoslovakia had been settled.After further discussion It was agreed thatthe Prime Minister should proceed on the general basis proposed, that is to say, that France,Russia and Great Britain should be jointguarantors, and that Germany should be invitedto sign a separate pact of non-aggression.
toangementsU Maintaining[f-and Orderf.?ing theansitionalriod.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thathe might be faced with an immediate difficulty inregard to the arrangements for maintaining law andorder in the period wMch would elapse until the newboundary had been defined.     He thought that herr hitler would very likely say that it would take sometime to carry out the steps proposed in the Frenchand British proposals and that, meanwhile, law andorder must be maintained.     He would almost certainlydemand the immediate withdrawal from the predominantlyGerman districts of the Czech military forces and the,Czech State Police,,     It was true that there was alsolocal Gendarmerie, but would they be able to keeporder?   If not, what other arrangements could be made?The Prime Minister said that much thoughthad been devoted to this question.     Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin, who probably had more knowledge of the localconditions than any other person in this country,thought that Herr Hitler&apos;s intention was to march his troops into the German areas immediately, in order tokeep order.     There were obvious political difficulties to this course, but there was a good deal to be said onpractical grounds for allowing the occupation at an earlydate by regular German troops of those areas in which tb-%German inhabitants constituted a very large majority,separate treatment being accorded to the other SudetenGerman districts.     A telegram had been despatched to dr. Benes asking for his views as to the best methodof maintaining order, assuming that the Czech soldiersand State Police were withdrawn, but making no positive suggestions.     There was a good deal ofevidence for the view that the State Police had acied
harshly and were personally very unpopular.     It would,of course, he an essential condition of any arrangement whereby certain of the Sudeten areas were occupied by german troops that Dr. Benes should concur in the stepproposed.     But it was not impossible that he would prefer occupation by German troops to occupation by HerrHenlein&apos;s Freikorps, who were undisciplined and muchmore likely to act harshly.     The scheme outlined alsopresupposed that both Herr Hitler and Dr. Benes should issue a declaration emphasising the need for taking steps to keep order and to improve the atmosphere.There were other areas where the PrimeMinister thought that occupation by German troops couldnot be contemplated.     Thus there were certain ares which included industrial centres, and were raciallymixed.     In these industrial centres there were considerable numbers of Czech workers who held Leftviews and were ? &quot;-dined to create disorder, and therewere also Communist bands.In these mixed districts, it would benecessary to have some force to support the localGendarmerie once the State Police and the Czech soldiershad been withdrawn.     With this end in view, a numberof alternative schemes had been proposed.One suggestion was the enrolment of a voluntary Special Constabulary of Sudeten Germans witha corps of international Officers.     But Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin&apos;^ view was that the Sudetph Germans were not tobe trusted, and that they might commit outrages onthe people they were supposed to protect.     Theinternational Officers would be scattered over large areas and could not exercise detailed control.
Another suggestion had been the employmentof Czech troops.     Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin had thoughtthat these also could not be relied upon.A third suggestion was the employment of aninternational military force.     He was afraid that,in practice, this would probably mean the employmentof British soldiers, since contingents from othercountries would probably not be forthcoming, at anyrate in substantial numbers.     The Prime Ministermentioned that this force would mainly be required tocontrol five or six industrial towns, including Teplice,Brux, BohmLeipe, Reichenberg and Gablonz.      If itcould   be agreed that these were the areas in whichdisturbances were likely the problem might be reducedto manageable proportions.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR reminded the Cabinetthat it   was at Reichenberg that the Sudeten germans had first raised their banner in 1918, and that difficulties might be anticipated if this centre was occupied by an international force.Continuing, THE PRIME MINISTER said that we might be faced with the possibility that some such scheme as this would be called for.     He had, therefore,consulted the Secretary of State for War and the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff as to whether they couldspare troops.     Much would depend on the number oftroops required.     The Chief of the   Imperial GeneralStaff had said   that, if a Division was required, itwould mean that one of the two Divisions of the intermediate Contingent would not be available for despatch to any other scene of operations.     Further
the employment of British troops in this area wouldinvolve certain obvious risks, and   this was not atask which we should undertake lightly or willingly.It was to be hoped that the number of troopsrequired might be found to be less than was expected,say, not more than 5,000.     In the War Office view it would   be three weeks before British troops could reach czechoslovakia.      It would not be possible to despatch a force of   this size without calling upSection &quot;A&quot; Reservists0The Prime Minister said   that he did not ask the Cabinet to reach any final decision on the schemewhich he had outlined.     He wished, however, to put before them the scheme, which, on present information,seemed to have the best chance of acceptance.     every endeavour would, of course, be made to persuade othercountries to join in sending contingents, if thedespatch of an international force proved to be necessary.There were two other measures which lio thought should be taken in order to help in the preservation of order.     The first was that Herr Hitler should agreeto the immediate disbandment of Herr Henlein&apos;s Freikorps.He had some doubts whether this was a genuine body, orwhether it had not been created for the purpose of stirringup trouble.        However that might be, if the jointFrench and British proposals   were accepted there seemed no ease for the continuance of the Freikorps.He .also thought that the number of Britishobservers should be considerably increased as soonas possible.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat telegrams had been despatched to certain minorPowers (Sweden, Holland and Yugo-Slavia) sounding them as to their willingness to send contingents to the pro-posed International Force,In reply to a question by THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORSCOTLAND, he said that he was not altogether happy atthe suggestion of employing French forces in proximity to German troops,     He had held over the suggestion of sending an invitation to Italy,     Opinion at the ForeignOffice had been opposed to this, mainly on account of the tone of Signor Mussolini&apos;s speech on Sunday last,THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE was Infavour of asking for quite a small contingent from Italy,THE MINISTER OF HEALTH agreed that the employment ofan international force was desirable, but he thought itwould be very difficult to allow German forces over thefrontier before any part of the proposed international force had reached Czechoslovakia.     He appreciated thatthe Prime Minister&apos;s proposal was conditional on Dr,Benes inviting German troops over the frontier, but herather doubted whether Dr. Benes would issue such an invitation.     He was also afraid of the reaction on public opinion.     It was true that the regular german troops had behaved better than the Nazis in Austria,Nevertheless he was afraid that there might be con-siderable excesses.     He asked whether an international force could not control all the areas concerned.     Hewas also afraid that the arrival of German troops in theGerman areas might have a disastrous effect on the mixedpopulations in the limitrophe areas,
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the arrangement proposeddepended for its success on the spirit in which it wascarried out.     If Herr Hitler was satisfied with the general lines of the agreement proposed, he hoped that he would nowexercise a restraining influence,,THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that theproposal to allow German troops to cross the frontierfilled him with great anxiety.     He thought it was essentialto convince people that German rule did not start beforethe frontier had been delimited, and those people who so desired had had an opportunity to leave the transferredareas.   ffAgain, he was not too happy about the proposal that British troops should be sent to Czechoslovakia.He thought that we should be represented as having givenaway Czechoslovakia!s case and then sent troops to ensurethat the proposals were carried out.     He thought that,if Herr Hitler showed good will, it should be possiblefor the Czechoslovak authorities to maintain order witha largely increased force of observers, reporting to international headquarters.     He thought that if theGerman troops were allowed to march in, the last chance ofthe plan being accepted by public opinion in this country would be destroyed.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY feared that if theGerman army was allowed to enter part of Czechoslovakia,it would end by their overrunning the whole country.
The. German army would put forward various pretexts,such as that it was necessary to throw out anoutpost line, or for the troops to make a further advance to restore order; and they would not stopuntil they were in Prague.    He thought that theaction taken by Herr Hitler in the last few days(as exemplified by the attitude of the Press, the raising of Herr Henlein&apos;s Freikorps, and the minorities question) showed that Herr hitler had not acted up to his word to the Prime Minister,Pending the fixing of the boundary by an Inter-national Commission, the areas concerned shouldbe administered by some form of international control.    He thought that the Prime minister should indicate to Herr Hitler that if he made any further demands we should go to war with him,not in order to prevent the Sudeten Germans fromexercising self-determination, but to stop herr hitler from dominating Europe.    In such an event the United States of America would come in onour side: and Germany, notwithstanding someinitial successes, would be faced with ultimatedefeat,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that, as Chairman of the Inter-GovernmentalCommission on Refugees, he had information of theappalling treatment accorded to minorities un austria.     We were under an obligation to
secure fair treatment for the people in the Sudeten-Germanareas who did not wish to he transferred to the Reich.     Hewas afraid that there was a great deal of innate crueltyin the German race.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would probably be facedwith a statement by Herr Hitler that thousands of people hadbeen turned out of their homes by Czechoslovak oppressionand that they must be allowed to return as soon as possible.He would be asked what solution he could put forward.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he thoughtthat Germany might be asked to look after these refugeesfor the time being.     It would be a shock to public opinionif German troops were allowed to enter Czechoslovakiaimmediately.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had no intention ofmaking any suggestion in this sense to Herr Hitler.     Theposition was that Herr Hitler was certain to demand theimmediate withdrawal of the Czech Army and of the CzechState Police.      It might be that Herr Hitler would besatisfied that if these steps were carried out, therewould be no disorder and that there was no need for troops.But this seemed to him to be a very large assumptionTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE referred to  Heaction which the Nazis had taken in Austria.     He thoughtthat if the Germans were allowed to send troops into the predominantly German areas, the minority of non-Germans,and the minority of Germans who did not wish to be incorporated in the Reich would be exposed to ill-treatment.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR suggested that the arrival ofGerman troops might prejudice the fixing of the boundary.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES thought that every possible effort should be made to ensure that BritishTroops, if required, could be despatched as soon as possible.-20-
He would &quot;be very unwilling to see German troops allowedto enter Czechoslovakia before the arrival of the proposed international force.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that if the cabinet decided to send troops they would be sent as expeditiouslyas possible.   He thought that the difficulties involved inthe despatch of troops had been very fairly stated by thePrime Minister.     It was clear that if the troops were sentthey w-uld he exposed to certain risks.THE PRIME MINISTER read a further telegram received fromthe British Ambassador at Berlin (Bo.  498), bearing on theproblem of law and order.    Sir Nevile Henderson suggestedthat a measure of control coulfjfc be entrusted to the Sudeten Germans when the State Police and Czechoslovak troops hadbeen withdrawn.    This, however, was directly contrary toMr. Ashton-Gwatkin1s view.The Prime Minister said that he appreciated the forceQt the views expressed by the Cabineto   He would not, ofcourse, start by suggesting the despatch of any troops butonly the despatch of additional observers and the withdrawalof the State Police and of the Czech troops from the SudetenGerman areas.   The next line would be to suggest the creationef some international force.    If it was not possible toreach an agreement which he regarded as satisfactory, hewould consult the Cabinet again*The Cabinet agreed to this course.THE PRIME MINISTER then read a further telegram whichhad been received from Prague (No. 6 77)*   This telegramreported full acceptance by the Czech Government of the jointFrench and British proposals   on the supposition that thetwo Governments would not tolerate a German invasion ofCzechoslovak territory, which would remain Czechoslovakiauntil the transfer had been effected.

FURTHER defence measures.(Previous reference cabinet 39(38)).3.   THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY saidthat the previous evening the Foreign office had informed him that Italy was moving alarge number of troops to Libya.     after consulting the Prime Minister it had been decidedthat the units of the Fleet now in the eastern mediterranean should be concentrated at alexandria, and that certain cruises in theEastern Mediterranean should be cancelled.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR raised the question whether it was now desirable togive effect to any of the other defence measureswhich had been deferred for further consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he understoodthat Departments were going ahead quietly withpreparations which involved no serious riskof publicity.     He thought that, for the timebeing, there was no need to take measures suchas recalling officers from leave, which would entail considerable publicity.The Cabinet agreed!That no steps should be taken for the time being to give effectto the further defence measureswhich had been deferred on theground that they would involve considerable publicity.iehmond Terrace, S.W.I.Slst September, 1938.
