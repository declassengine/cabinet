^HE INTER- The Cabinet met for the purpose of hearing fromNATIONALSITUATION. the Prime Minister a statement on his recent visit to central Europe.-Herr Hitler at Berchtesgaden in connection with theCzechoslovakia,   position in Central Europe and Czechoslovakia, and theThe Prime serious international situation which had arisen.     TheMinister1 visit to Herr      Cabinet also had before them a copy of Notes by SirHitler.Horace Wilson, who had accompanied the Prime Minister(previous reference: (C-.P. 202(38)).Cabinet 38(38)). THE PRIME MINISTER thought the most convenientF.iz.li-o2. plan would be that the Cabinet should first hear from lord Runciman, whom they were glad to have with them,an account of the present position in Czechoslovakia.That would be the proper background for his account ofhis visit to Herr Hitler.     The Cabinet knew how greatan   influence Lord Runciman had established in czechoslovakia, and what respect was felt in that countryfor his impartiality and industry^     It must be adisappointment to him that after so much work the situa-tion should have deteriorated so rapidly.     It would bea great mistake, however, to think that Lord Runciman&apos;work had been thrown away.     It had succeeded in preserv-ing the situation, and had convinced the world that every possible effort had been made to find a solution bymediation.     This country was under a deep debt of grattitude to Lord Runciman and his Staff.LORD RUNCIMAN said that he was, of course,disappointed that he had not been able to bringabout a solution by agreement between the parties concerned. He had borne it in mind, however,that Lord Halifax had told him, when he left for Prague, that time gained was   of
importance.    He could not have carried out the work whichhe had done without the assistance of his admirable staff.In particular, he owed a great deal to Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin.On his arrival at Prague, Lord Runciman had found the Czech Government blind to what was going on aroundthem.    Dr. Benes was a man of great ability, so agilethat he made those about him distrust him.    Dr. Hodzawas an excellent Prime Minister, but with rather limitedexperience.    The other members of the Czech cabinet were of poor quality and did not count.At the outset, Lord Runciman continued, he had made enquiries into the political and economic position.Much of the support which the Sudeten Germans receivedcame from people who were suffering from a very acuteeconomic depression, and the efforts which his Missionhad made to find solutions for those economic troubleshad strengthened their hands.On the political issues,  the Sudeten germans had from the outset been very suspicious.    Herr Henleinlived at Asch, four hours&apos; motor journey away fromPrague,  and could only be seen occasionally.    He was agenial, good-tempered person, but nothing much couldbe got out of him.&apos;  Lord Runciman had since learned that, even before his own arrival in Prague, Herr Henleinhad been in frequent communication with Berlin.Herr Prank had a bad influence and was unreliable.Recently he had broken away from the Party and had become more extreme.
Herr Kundt, on the other hand, had been very useful to the Mission.     He was a good type of man, whoknew his case well and could be relied upon0      LordRunciman said that before leaving Prague on the previous day he had asked Herr Kundt whether he was still amember of the Party0     He had replied that he hadsevered his connection with the Party as, although hewas not a Czech, he did not want to become a Germansubject.      Herr Kundt was ready to resume conversations at any time if we wanted him to do sooLord Runciman said that one of his difficulties had been to get at the real facts, behind all theexaggeration which was currentc -   By degrees he had got the two parties into the way of saying what points theywould agree to, and had induced them to put their namesto various plans.Lord Runciman. gave some details of the fourplans which had been producedo      The last of these which still held the field, included the eight Carlsbad points,and would have given Herr Henlein and his colleagues-a basis on which they could have agreed to participate in the government of the country  There was no pointin putting forward any further plan at the present time.The Sudeten Party now proposed the inclusion ofthe Sudeten areas in the Reich.      The Czech Governmentwould take strong action to stop thiso     They had ordered the arrest of Herr Henlein, who was now in Bavaria.Various possible solutions had been put forward.. -to deal with the present position.      The Sudeten-Germanleaders spoke of a plebiscite as though it offered theonly possible solution.      The difficulties  in theway of such a solution were, of course,    very
great, though he (Lord Runciman) would not say thatthey could not he overcome.     He mentioned, forexample, the definition of areas;    the formulation&apos;of the questions to he -put;    the control whichwould he needed to prevent intimidation, and so forth.   Even in normal times a plebiscite would nothave been the best way of dealing with the situation.At the present time, he doubted whether free expression of opinion was possible.      He thoughtthat Dr. Benes shared this doubt.     The Army wouldnot stand the strain of a plebiscite well.The great centres of opposition to theGovernment were Eger and Asch,  in the north-westerncorner of Bohemia, which contained about 800,000Germans and very few of any other1 race.     Thetransfer of these areas to Germany would almost certainly be a good thing.      On the other hand,the Czechoslovak army would certainly oppose any transfer of territory    very strongly.     Dr. Beneshad said that they would fight rather than accept it.The Military Attache had said that the czechoslovak army was a formidable force, butlacked experience.A second possible solution.was the creationof a new.and independent Sudeten-German State, butit was clear- that nothing could be made of this alternative in present conditions.Another third solution was a Four-power conference.     This suggestion&apos;would probably haveto be linked up somehow to the plebiscite, if a plebiscite was adopted as the best way out.Mr. Newton, our Minister in Prague, was in .favour of a Federal solution.      Mr. Newton was aman of much commonsense, who had kept hishead very well.     Mr. Newton agreed, however,-a.-
that at the present time a Federal solution was unlikely to he acceptable.Lord Runciman said that it had been suggested invarious telegrams that he should produce a plan of hisown.   Ee had always been reluctant to adopt this oourse,since it would draw upon^&amp;Umaothe fire of criticism.For this reason his Mission had never fathered thefourth plan, which had met with a considerable measureof support.Even at the present time a number of bankers,including men like Dr. Preiss, thought that a solutionbased on the fourth plan might prove acceptable.   Dr.Pi*eiss,s suggested solution included the following:-(1) The Carlsbad Eight Points, which, the czech Government had now accepted.(2) Suppression of the Communist Party in czechoslovakia.(3) Denunciation of the Russians-CzechPolitical Treaty.(Lord Runciman here said that Dr. Beneshad told him. there was no such Treaty,  .and maintained that there was only &quot;an*iunderstanding&quot; between the two countries).(4) Permanent representation of the Sudeten-German people in the Cabinet.(This would probably have been acceptedby the Czechs).(5) A Commission of equal numbers of Czechsand Germans to deal with disputes in carryingout the agreement.(6) A Commercial Treaty with Germany.Lord Runciman thought, however, that there wasno hope that this plan would now prove acceptable.Lord Runciman then replied to a. number of questionswhich were put to him by members of the Cabinet.He   said   that   he   had   reached   the
conclusion that Czechoslovakia could not continue to exist as she was today.     Somethingwould have to he done, even if it   amounted to no more than cutting off certain fringes.There were numerous instances of Sudeten Germans having been pushed out of Government posts and Czechs put in their places. This applied to nearly all the State Services.Again, in affording financial assistance todistressed areas, the Government had taken care tosee that practically all the money had gone toCzech areas.       The Czechs were, in fact, themselvesresponsible for most of the trouble.Lord Runciman explained how he had succeeded in persuading the Czech Government to dispossess ;fefeeCzech officials in Eger and Asch, and to replace them&quot;by/Germans. There had been -eonsicie.aaakj?e rejoicingover these and other changes which had been made.As regards Dr. Benes, he thought that he was rather more honest than he allowed himself to appear to be.     He was much cleverer than anyone else in the country, and this gave him a reputationfor slipperiness.     It would be a calamity if bothDr. Benes and Dr. Hodza left the Government,     he doubted whether Dr. Benes could persuade the CzechArmy to accept a plebiscite.     He thought thatthere was a considerable percentage of people inthe German areas who did not wish to be incorporated in the Reich.Asked whether Dr. Benes still relied on french assistance, Lord Runciman said that theFrench Minister, at a party given by the latter,had spoken very freely about the attitude ofFrance and had told half a dozen people that there
IIwere things for which France would not go to warPand that it. was just as well that they should be clearly known0In reply to a question from the Home Secretary,as to whether the two sides had ever been near to agreement, Lord Runciman said that about a fortnightago they had been very close, but at that time hehad not fully realised the close connection betweenthe Sudeten-German leaders and Berlin0     Dr. Beneshad then slowed up the negotiations, which had againbecome difficult0In reply to the First Lord of the Admiralty,Lord Runciman said that he thought Herr Kundt would obtain considerable supporto     The other officials of the party had left Prague, but Herr Kundt had stayedon there.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked Lord Runcimanfor his statement, which he thought would be of great assistance to the Cabinet in sizing up the positionsTHE PRIME MINISTER then gave an account of his visit to Herr Hitler0     He attached great importanceto the dramatic side of the visit, since we weredealing with an individual and a new technique ofdiplomacy relying on personal contacts.was required.The Prime Minister described how, from thetime of his arrival at the airfield at Munich, therewere crowds in the towns and villages along:hisroute, who saluted and welcomed him     He hadtravelled by train from Munich to Berchtesgaden, ajourney of three hours6     There was nothing in the conversations which he had on the . journey which was of special importance0
On arrival at Berchtesgaden, lie was met by aguard of honour and, after half an hour&apos;s wait at the hotel, he had driven up the mountain.    After passingtwo guarded entrances, they found themselves at theBrown House.    Hitler was standing halfway down the stepsand came down to shake hands with him.On a first view, Herr Hitler was unimpressive.There was nothing out of the common in his features.The party had proceeded through a barely furnishedcorridor to the big room, which had so often been described where they had had tea.At one point during the visit Herr Hitler had expressed his distress at the long journey the PrimeMinister had had to undertake0    He had thought of offering to come to England, but had realised that thedifficulties were too great0    At another point, herr hitler had asked whether there would be strongdemonstrations of disapproval if he came to London, towhich the Prime Minister had replied that it would be aswell to choose the right moment.After talking platitudes for about half an hour, Herr Hitler asked him what was to be the next stage.    Would he like two or three of each side to be present?   The Prime Minister had said that he would prefer a private talk with Herr Hitler alone.About 5.20, therefore, the Prime Ministerand Herr Hitler went off with Dr. Schmidt to herr hitler*s room.    The conversation lasted until 8.15 p,m.
The Prime Minister said that he had no idea thatthis conversation would last anything approaching solong a time9     What he had in mind was to open bysuggesting to Herr Hitler that this was an opportunityfor bringing about a new understanding between Englandand Germanyc     He had started on this line.     He had said that this idea had been in his mind ever since hehad been Prime minister     Up till now various events had occurred which had rendered it impossible to makeany progress, but he hoped that the opportunity had now come.     The events of the last few weeks, however, hadbeen so serious that, unless some remedy could be found,it seemed likely that his hopes of an understand.ingwouid continue to be disappointed.       It was this, andnot merely the troubles in Czechoslovakia, that had madehim want to visit Herr Hitlero     Herr Hitler had replied that the other matters to which the PrimeMinister referred were of great importance, but unfortunate-ly there was something else of the utmost urgency and could not wait, namely the Sudeten-German question.The Prime Minister had then agreed to discuss this matter.The   Prime Minister said he would like to givethe impression which he had formed of Herr Hitler asthe conversation proceeded.     He saw no signs of insanitybut many of excitement.     Occasionally Herr Hitler would lose the thread of what he was saying and would go offinto a tirade.     It was impossible not to be impressed with the power of the man.     He was extremely determined;he had thought out what he wanted and he meant to get itand he would not brook opposition beyond a certain point.Further, and this was a point of considerable importance,the Prime Minister had formed the opinion that herr hitler&apos;s objectives were strictly limited.
7 oHaving agreed to discuss the Chechoslovakiansituation, he had been surprised that Herr Hitlerdid not at once start by saying that his people were being tortured,,      Instead he had given an historical account of his attitude towards Germany&apos;sneighbours.     He dealt first with his Agreement with poland:    he regarded his boundary with Poland asbeing definitely fixed.     Next Prance.      If the saar had been allocated to Prance, it would have beena source of friction, but in the end it had cometo Germany and that matter was now closed.     He repeated that he had renounced any claim to Alsace Lorraine.Next, he spoke of the British Naval Treaty.     Hehad made the Treaty because he had thought he would never be at war with England, but (and here herr hitler began to talk truculently) if there ceased to be an understanding that there would be no war between England and Germany, and if English peoplecontinued to talk, as they had recently, in athreatening way, then it might be better to denounce the Naval Treaty..At this point the Prime Minister said thathe had interrupted, and had asked for Herr Hitler&apos;sstatement to be interpreted, - a course he had toadopt   many times during the discussion.     Did theFuehrer mean that he would denounce the Treatybefore we went to war with him?     The Fuehreranswered   in   the   affirmative;     he   had   madethe   Treaty   on the   assumption   that   .we   had
renounced all idea of going to war with Germany,   ThePrime Minister said that he would like to deal withthis point at once.    It was for Herr Hitler to decide what he wanted to do, hut in his (the Prime Minister1 s)view there was the greatest difference between a warning and a threat.   After 1914 it had been said thatif Germany had been warned of our attitude in time, she would never have come into&apos; the war.   We did not wantpeople to make that complaint again.   There would be just grounds for complaint if we let it be thought thatin no circumstances would we go to war with Germany,if, in fact, there were circumstances in which we should do so.   He thought it was better that that should bemade clear.Herr Hitler replied that a warning or a threathad much the same result.   The Prime Minister said hethought it better not to pursue the point further atthe time,Herr Hitler then continued his review of hisrelations with his neighbours.   Prom his youth up he hadpursued the idea of racial unity.   He referred to the10 million Germans outside the Reich;    7 million un austria and 3 million In the Sudeten lands.    the austrians were now in the Reich.    There remained the sudeten Germans,    In this connection, Herr Hitlerdistinguished between what was possible and what   wasimpossible, and said he appreciated that there were Germansliving outside Germany who could not be brought into the Reich,
As regards .the Sudeten Germans, they wanted to come in.      They must come in.     If they were not allowed to come in, he would have to see that theydid, and if necessary he would run the risk of a world war in order to &quot;bring them in.     This, said the Prime Minister, was the gist of what herr hitler said, although he could not say that this wasthe exact equivalent of the words used.At this point the Prime Minister said thathe again stopped Herr Hitler and said that the rb was something which he wished.to know which was mostimportant.      Suppose that the Sudeten Germans were included in the Reich, was that all that herr hitler wanted,  or had he some other aims?     Thepoint was of importance, because there were anumber of people in England who did not believewhat Herr Hitler said.     They thought that hewas trying to deceive us, and they took the viewthat his real aim was not merely the inclusion ofthe Sudeten Germans in the Reich, but thedismemberment of Czechoslovakia.!/&apos;&apos;Herr Hitler then said that what he was concerned with was the German race.     He did not wish to include Czechs in the Reich.     When hehad included the Sudeten Germans in the Reich he wouldbe satisfied.     He referred to his Treaties withBelgium and Holland.     The only other placewhich he&apos; mentioned was Memel, which he said
he was prepared to leave, provided the Lithuaniansstood by the Statute of Memel.The Prime Minister said that the impressionleft on him was that Herr Hitler meant what hesaid.     He thought also that this conversation was consistent with what Herr Hitler had said at other times.      It was clearly of the utmost importance tomake up one&apos;s mind whether the inclusion of the sudeten Germans in the Reich was the end at which herr Hitler was aiming or only a beginning.     Thiswas a matter on which one could only exercise one&apos;ejudgment.     The Prime Minister1 s view was that herr hitler was telling the truth.At this point the Prime Minister had said to herr Hitler &quot;Speaking without prejudice and supposingit was decided to incorporate the Sudeten Germansinto the Reich, are there not practical difficulties to be worked out?     Thus, if all the districtscontaining 80 per cent, of Germans were incorporated,that would leave many Germans behind in czechoslovakia and there would be many Czechs in the incorporated areas.Would not that have to be provided for?     Y/ould it notbe necessary to have not merely a transfer of territory,but a transfer of populations?&quot;     Herr Hitler had agreed, but had said that it was not a question ofpercentages.     Where there was a majority of Germans,there the territory must go to the Reich,     Withregard to the transfer of populations, that might bearranged, or it might be decided that the minoritiesshould stay where they were, under suitable safeguards.

Where there was a majority of Germans,there the territory must go to the Reich,     Withregard to the transfer of populations , that might bearranged, or it might be decided that the minoritiesshould stay where they were, under suitable safeguards.
The Prime Minister had said that he thought there were other difficulties, whereupon Herr Hitler had saidthat this was academic.      They had to face terrible,facts.     He referred to a statement that 300 Sudeten Germans had been killed the day before, that villageswere being put into a state of siege and thatrefugees were pouring across the frontier.     all this must be solved at once.       At this point Herr Hitlebegan to grow excited.The Prime Minister said that at this stage hehad thought it necessary to show a stiffer attitude.He had said that if the Fuehrer really intended to,settle the matter in this way he wondered why hehad allowed the Prime Minister to come to see hirn, andwhether he (the Prime Minister) had not wasted histime in coming and had not better go home.      Thiswas perhaps the turning point of the conversation.Herr Hitler became quieter in his manner.      The PrimeMinister had suggested that he and Herr Hitler mightissue some joint appeal to the parties to restraintheir followers.     Herr Hitler had raised objectionsto this, and the Prime Minister had not pursued thesuggestion.     Then Herr Hitler had said that it all depended on the attitude of the British Government.If the British Government could not accept the principleof self-determination there was no use in pursuingthe negotiations;    if they could, then he thought thathe and the Prime Minister could get to work and discuss the method of procedures
The Prime Minister had said in reply that hewas not in a position to give any such assurance.    It wasnecessary for him. to consult the British Cabinet, theFrench Government and Lord Runciman.    (He had hot mentioned the Czech Government at this point).   But he would giveHerr Hitler his personal opinion, which was that, looking at the question as one of principle, It was immaterialto him whether the Sudeten Germans stayed in czechoslovakia or were included in the Reich.   What theBritish people wanted was a peaceful and a just settlement.It was the practical difficulties of.the position thattroubled him.Herr Hitler then asked what   course the PrimeMinister suggested.    The Prime Minister had proposed thatthe conversations should be adjourned, that he should go back to England and consult his colleagues, and that, havingdone so, he should return to continue the conversations.Herr Hitler had agreed to this, but had expressed,.regret that the Prime Minister should have a second long joursiey-..and had offered to come as far as the frontier for thesecond meeting.The question had then been discussed whether theposition in Czechoslovakia could be held in the meantime.The Fuehrer*s first approach to this had been to say that itwas a matter for the Czechs;    if only they would withdraw the State police and confine the troops to barracks andstop mobilisation, order would be restored at once.The Prime Minister had then asked whether Herr Hitlercould not do something to assist this object.
Herr Hitler had replied that the German military-machine was a terrific instrument.      In effect,he had left it to he understood that the machinewas ready to act at any momento      Any serious incident which occurred would release the springand the pincers would close.      Once the machinewas put in motion, nothing could stop it.Herr Hitler gave an assurance that he would&apos;mot give the order to set the machine in motionpending the resumption of conversations, if hecould help it.      He felt hound to make this qualification because some incident might occurwhich would force his hand.In the Prime Minister&apos;s judgment thesituation when he went out to Germany had been oneof desperate urgency. If he had not gone hethought that  hostilities  would have started by now.      The atmosphere had been electric.      Fantasticstories of outrages were accepted without question.A man as excitable as Herr Hitler might easily be carried away by some unfounded report.The Prime Minister said that his impression was that Herr Hitler would prove, to be better thanhis word, and &quot;chat he would take care not to set the military machine in motion for a period long enough to allow ut: time for a reasonable discussion.At the same time, the longer the delay the greater the danger,  since it was impossible to rely on a continuation of the relaxation of tension which hadbeen secured.The Prime Minister said that Sir Horace wilson had taken great pains to impress on Dr. von Dircksen, andthe other German officials with whom he had come in con-tact, that any aggressive action taken by Germany beforethe Prime Minister&apos;sl second visit took place would betreated by the British people as an intolerable affront.
The Prime Minister thought that Herr Hitler would hold the position until the conversations had teen resumed, hut itwas important to lose no time*The Prime Minister emphasised that there had been no opportunity for him to put smaller points, or to try andimpose conditions, or to get Herr Hitler to accept alternativesolutions which seemed reasonable over here but which wouldnot have been accepted in the atmosphere prevailing atBerchtesgarten.     The only practical course had been for himto return home and consult his colleagues.The Prime Minister concluded by saying that when he  leftHerr Hitler he had been uncertain what impression he had made upon him.     He mentioned, however, that Herr Hitler&apos;s mannerwas definitely different when they left his study;    he hadstopped halfway down the stairs and lamented the fact that the bad weather made it impossible for him to take the PrimeMinister to see the view from the top of the mountain.     herr hitler had said that he hoped this might be possible on someother occasion.    Information from other sources had been tothe effect that the Fuehrer had been most favourably im-pressed.     This was of the utmost importance, since the futureconduct of these negotiations depended mainly upon personalcontacts.The Prime Minister thought that it was not possible todeal with a man such as Herr Hitler by attaching conditions.He thought, however, that if the principle of self-determina-tion was accepted and negotiations were entered into as to themethod of applying that principle, Herr Hitler would not provetoo difficult about such questions as the area of the plebiscite, and the conditions under which it was to becarried out.At the end of the conversation Herr Hitler had saidthat when the Czechoslovakian question was settled hewould like to take up the question of Anglo-German relations and especially the question of colonies;    Germany would not abandon her demand for colonies, but it was not a war matter.-17-
The Prime Minister thought that,  if it waspossible to get a settlement of the present difficulty,there was a chance of obtaining a settlement of othermatters also..THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR asked whetherby &quot;self-determination&quot; Herr Hitler meant a plebiscite.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Herr Hitler hadnot used the word &quot;plebiscite&quot;, but he felt sure thatthat was what he meant.    He added that the german foreign Office had for some time been working onplebiscite questions.The Prime Minister added that Herr Hitler had made some allusion to the Soviet Treaty.    He (thePrime Minister) had asked whether,  if the Sudeten Germans were brought into the Reich, Herr Hitler would feel any anxiety about the remainder of Czechoslovakia.Herr Hitler&apos;s answer had been &quot;Yes,  if the Treatycontinues&quot;.    The Prime Minister had asked what would happen if the Treaty was modified,    Herr Hitler hadanswered this indirectly by saying that if the Sudeten Germans were given self-determination the same wouldhave to be done for the Hungarians, the Poles,  andthe Slovaks.    If that happened he would not worry inthe least about what would be left of Czechoslovakia.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidMil-thaythe question of the other minorities was v-ea?g*important, did not feel that the plebiscite needapply to them.v&apos; . i. &apos;. .   .- jiTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said lthat the Polish Minister, whom he had seen the previous jiday, had said that if a plebiscite was given to the sudeten Germans the Polish Government v/ould expect it for the Poles in Czechoslovakia, e.g.,  at Teschen, Ifthis was not granted the relations between Poland and czechoslovakia would be seriously strainedo. -18-   .
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR asked whether itwould he possible to accept the principle of self-determina-tion, on an undertaking being given by Herr Hitler thatit should be carried out on really fair conditions, and ifhe agreed to dempbolise the Army before effect was givento self-determination.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not think itwas possible to attach conditions to our acceptance of theprinciple.     We should make no progress in that way. what he would like to say was that now the principle had beenagreed, it remained to examine how it should be carriedout.     He thought we could make good progress on theselines,   - This, of course, could not be done until we had consulted the French.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said that unless the Czech Government were prepared to co-operate in arranging a fair plebiscite, he did not see how a properplebiscite could be carried through,^- He feared that itmight be difficult to get the Czech Government to acceptthe solution of a plebiscite, and it seemed to him that force might have to be used to.prevent fighting frombreaking out.     He asked whether it was proposed that theCabinet1 s decision should be communicated to the opposition and to Parliament before the Prime Minister saw Herr Hitleragain.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he proposed to seerepresentatives of the Opposition and to explain thepresent position to them.     As regards Parliament, his view was that a discussion   in Parliament at the presenttime would result In wrecking Very delicate negotiations.Parliament would be summoned as soon as that course wouldbe helpful.     In effect, Parliament would be informed ofthe decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government after it had beentaken.     It would be for Parliament to say whether they-i9-
approved the course taken, and were prepared to ratify it.Discussion then ensued as to the attitude to headopted vis-a-vis the French Government,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS sai dthat all the French Government had been told was that thePrime Minister had found the situation critical, but thoughtthat Herr Hitler would hold his hand until the conversationscould be resumed.     They had also been told that herr hitler had pressed for acceptance of the principle ofself-determination, but that the method of giving effectto that principle had not been discussed.The Foreign Secretary also read a telegram received from Sir Eric Phipps to the effect that the FrenchGovernment were much disturbed, as they had not beeninformed of what had happened ac Berchtesgaden, and asked that M. Daladier and M. Bonnet might come to London as soonas possible.     This telegram had been despatched beforethe French had received the information which he had justreferred to.     He thought that there was great danger thatthe responsibility for the decision taken at the presenttime might be placed on our shoulders, although it was Franceand. not we ourselves who had Treaty obligations with the czechoslovak Government.After further discussion on this point it.was agreed(i)   That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should invite the representativesof the French Government to come over tothis country as soon as possible fordiscussion;(ii)   and that the discussions with the french should be conducted on the basis thatwe should endeavour to reach a jointdecision with the French Government,-SO-
In the course of further discussion THESECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR suggested that it might be .desirable that a Committee of Experts should be called together to examine the possibilities of improvisinga workable scheme for a plebiscite.    The General staff had already prepared a paper on the military forces which would be necessary to exercise control.    Itappeared that not less than 3 divisions would berequired, and that it would be difficult to protect them from outside attack, for example, by the Czechforces.    The problems were not, he thought, insolublebut it&apos; was desirable that they should be examined assoon as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hoped hiscolleagues were prepared to express their generalagreement with the proposition that we should acceptthe principle of self-determination, on the understand-ing that no announcement to this effect should be madefor the present time, and that we should next proceedto negotiate with the French.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL suggestedthat the Cabinet should endorse the attitude which thePrime Minister had taken in his negotiations with herr Hitler, but should postpone recording a formaldecision until after the negotiations with the French.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought itv/as a little difficult to reach a. decision on such a vital issue, when the Cabinet had only just beeninformed of the position resulting from the PrimeMinister&apos;s discussion with Herr Hitler.    Further,unless the Prime Minister was certain that he could obtain
satisfactory conditions, we might he faced witha demand for a plebiscite in its baldest form.He would like further time to consider thematteroTHE MINISTER OP HEALTH also thought that itwas undesirable to conclude the discussion that morning, without further consideration.     If, thePolish and Hungarian minorities also demanded self-determination, the result might be the dismembermentof Czechoslovakia,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe difficulty he felt in arriving at a decision wasthe fear that, by doing so, we might be led into acomplete surrender.     He noted with some regret thatthe Prime Minister had not been able to put forward to Herr Hitler a number of reasonable propositions(such as the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s plan forautonomy for a period of years, to be followed by a plebiscite).     Further, what Herr Hitler had said about Czechoslovakia&apos;s Treaty with Russia showed thathe was not prepared to leave any independence to czechoslovakia,     He thought that Czechoslovakiawould probably prefer to fight,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER wasalso in favour of postponing a decision until therehad been time for further discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought that it was entirely reasonable that the Cabinet should have further opportunity for discussion it was agreed that it was desirable tohave a further discussion in cabinet before the French representatives started.The Cabinet accordingly adjourned until3,0 p,m.
THE CABINET resumed discussion of the internationalposition which had been adjourned at 1.30 p.m.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a telegram had beenreceived from Geneva to the effect that M. Bonnet was somewhat incensed that the French had not been immediatelybrought into consultation.     He thought that this had beenput right by the action which had now been taken.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had little to say.     He hoped the Cabinet would give the PrimeMinister an assurance that what the Prime Minister hadalready given as his personal opinion, expressed the general view of the Government.THE LORD CHANCELLOR referred to the principles offoreign policy laid down by Canning and approved by DisraeliUnder that policy two conditions had to be satisfied before we intervened.     First, that British interests were seriously affected;    secondly, that we should only inter-vene with overwhelming force.     When he became LordChancellor, this policy was being observed.     He had beeninformed that British interests were not vitally affectedby what happened to the   Sudeten Germans.      It was theFrench whose treaty obligations were involved, and thoseobligations were not altogether straightforward and werecuriously worded.     It had, however, been agreed that ifthe French became involved and their security was threatenedthis country could not stand aside.     That had been theposition up till to-day, except that this country had madeendeavours through the Foreign Secretary and Lord Runcimanto reach a solution which would satisfy Germany.     NowLord Runeiman&apos;s efforts had failed, and we had been in-formed what Herr Hitler1 s attitude was.     Lord Maughamreached the conclusion that, except for some possible lossOf prestige, British interests were not involved.
Further, no action on our part could prevent herr hitler from over-running Czechoslovakia.)In considering what action should be taken, it mustbe remembered th.-t we were not immediately involved,but France was,     France should therefore be asked firstwhat action she proposed to take0      It must be rememberedthat France had no overwhelming force at her disposal.      Ifthe opinion of the French Government were asked, it was likely that they would reply that they were a democraticpeople, and that they could not go to war to keep 3-g- millionGermans xinder the Prague Government 0     That would be theeffect of their answer, save for certain face-savingphrases.     He thought that if the French asked, us ouropinion, we should reply that it was France which was primarily involved, but that we thought they -would takea wise course if they said that they wouldVnot fight toprevent the self-determination of the Sudeten GermanscContinuing, the Lord Chancellor said that it would bea very serious thing to involve this country in war inthe present disputec     Some people might regard this attitude as cowardly, but such people were not in aposition to understand the factors involved.      If war broke out to-day, it would be a long and desperate affairand would cause immense sacrifice,      Further, the positionof the Empire must be ccnei&amp;ered.     The Congress party inIndia might take advantage of the position;    there mightbe an Arab revolt in Asia and armed neutrality^ if not war,on the part of JapanPSubject to the form in which the   Government&apos;determination was made known, he thought that the course proposed by the Prime Minister was the right one a
THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY,, referring to theLord Chancellor^ remarks, said that it was a primary-interest of this country to prevent any single powerdominating Europe.   We were now faced with the most formidable power for a century.   As regards the condition that we should not intervene unless we had overwhelmingforce, we had not got it now and were unlikely to attainit.    It was of the utmost importance to pacify Germany andthere was almost no length to which he would not go   to attain this end.    But what chance was there of achieving this?   He found it difficult to believe that the self-determination of the Sudeten Germans was Hitler&apos;s lastaim.   He did not altogether understand Herr Hitler&apos;sremark about the colonies, to which the Prime Minister; had referred.The First Lord also referred to the series of statements which Herr Hitler had made to the effect that hehad no intention of attacking Austria or Czechoslovakia.He felt that his promises were quite unreliable.At the present time, the country was singularlyunited, and the Dominions would probably be more attracted by the idea of supporting the democratic countries in a fight against dictators than they were by the issues withwhich we were faced in 1914*The First Lord was afraid that even if a solutionof the present problem was found, it would not be the endof our troubles, and that there was no chance of peace in Europe so long as there was a Nazi regime in Germany.
He was afraid that Germany might make someattempt on our Colonial Empire, and that on such,an issue neither Prance nor the United states would rally to our help.     He saw no prospect that we should be able to increase the tempoof our re-armament9 owing to the financial situation.He hoped that when the prime Minister sawHerr Hitler again next week he would make itclear that we were only prepared to agree to a plebiscite provided certain conditions were accepted.Hitherto] the First Lord said, the arguments on which he had relied had run counter to the lineof action proposed by the Prime Minister.     But   -a war in modern conditions was a terrible affair,and no government &apos;was in a position to forecast thefuture with certainty.     While, therefore, hewas afraid that although we might avoid war now we might only be gutting off the evil day, therewas the chance that, some unforeseen event mightupset the rule of the Nazi party.     That chance,he thought, was worth taking.If, however, we were to act on this course,he thought we should decide that the Governmentwas prepared to accept the principle ofself-determination as the basis of negotiation,but that the question of how it should beapplied in the present abnormal circumstances should be the subject of careful enquiry.     Thatwas as far as he thought we ought to go.
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said that he thought most of his colleagues would.,feel the force of what the First Lord had said.U^ ^ ^^F0^/^He doubted, however, whether there was anyessential difference between his^opiniooa and thePrime Minister&apos;s. (The First Lord said that he hoped that this was so).Continuing, Sir Thomas Inskip said that wemust face the facts of the situation.     It wasnot a question of fighting a war,to preserveCzechoslovakia^- that we could not hope to achieve -but of fighting a war to check Herr Hitler.     Sucha war, would .cause immense suffering and damage, and while it might destroy Hitler it would almost certainlydestroy a great deal more.-    The result might bechanges in the state of Europe which would- be satisfactory to no one except Moscow and the Bolsheviks.     Though thedecision was a difficult one, he felt no doubt in hisown mind what the decision would be and he agreed withthe Prime Minister. ,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that/he would prefer some solution other than a plebiscite.It must be remembered that the Czechoslovaks hadmissed many opportunities through lack of statesmanship,especially in the last few months.     Their treatmentof minorities left much to be desired.     In recent months M. Benes had had opportunities, to stave off
the demands of the Sudeten Germans;    hut he had always procrastinated and been too late.     Thepeople of this country would be overwhelmingly infavour of a plebiscite rather than a war.     he therefore favoured acceptance of the principle ofself-determination.     Nevertheless, it was clearthat this decision would put us into a possibledilemma.     The Prime Minister had said that Herr hitler would take some violent action if we started to lay down the conditions^      If, therefore, we were todeal satisfactorily with Herr Hitler we must acceptthe principle of self-determination unconditionallyand talk about conditions later.     Prom the point ofview of our own people this was a difficult positionto sustain.     He asked whether it was possible tosay to Herr Hitler that we accepted self-determinationbut that we of course would want to sit down withhim and work out details so as to ensure the properimplementation of the principle.     That, he thought,would leave us with an adequate defence.      He thoughtthat it was quite likely that we should obtain areasonable settlement with Herr Hitler, and in this event the Government would have the overwhelmingsupport of this country.     Nevertheless, he anticipateddifficulties with Prance and with the czechoslovak government.      The latter difficulty might be overcomeif we were prepared to give Czechoslovakia a guarantee.
THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had for sometime felt that a guarantee was the key to theposition.     It was important, however, to seethat Herr Hitler did not gain everything he wanted without making some concession, and it wasvery desirable to obtain some quid pro quo from him in the negotiations.     He felt quite sure that, apart from the decision to be reached bythe Cabinet, self-determination had already started in Czechoslovakia.     The Czech Government hadreally lost the Sudeten Germans and till thatfact was recognised there would be no peace inEurope.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said that herr Hitler was determined to incorporate the sudeten Germans in the Reich and that it wasimpossible to prevent him from doing so.     Thereal question was whether he should do so peace-fully or by force.     He did not doubt that theformer was the better alternative.     At thesame time he was anxious not to say that we wereactuated solely by the principle of self-determination.Were we to do so the Indian Congress Party wouldnot be slow to take advantage of such a declaration on our part.The Secretary of State for India referred tothe appalling results which would follow from a world war.     This would bring about the destruction
of the present world order and the emergence of something which might approximate to the ideals ofthose who controlled the destiny of Russia.     he also referred to a number of circumstances which wouldmake war extremely difficult for us at the present time.Italy would be likely to come in against us and weshould have to supply forces in the Mediterranean.Owing to recent changes in the British Army in Indiathere were now 12,000 fewer troops in India than in1914 and it would be difficult to call upon india for reinforcements.      Further, Moslem opinion was becoming more and more exercised about the positionin Palestine and we should probably require to retainin India all the troops which were now there.      Ifthere was no alternative between force and self-determination he would prefer acceptance of thelatter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said thatthe vast majority of people would prefer a plebisciteto war, but the method of holding a plebiscite soas to ensure fair treatment was of great importance.We could not urge the French to fight a war so asto prevent the application of the principle ofself-determination.     He was much impressed by thefact that in the Prime Minister&apos;s view Herr hitler had limited objectives.     He trusted that somelimitation of armaments might follow the present -negotiations.
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it wasimpossible to object to the principle of self-deter-mination.       Nevertheless, in present circumstances he thought that it was almost impossible to make the concessions asked for.     These concessions would be unfair to $he Czechs and dishonourable to ourselves,after all tjhat we had. done in the 3,ast few months.He though-^ ^t was wrong to assume that there were no other courses open to us than war or completesurrender.     He asked whether we had ever placedourselves in such a humiliating position as tonegotiate with a country which had a million and a half men under arms.     The third alternative whichhe suggested was that we should obtain peace withhonour, and if that was unobtainable, we must face the possibility of war.     Unless we did this,whenever Herr Hitler threatened the world, we shouldhave to concede what he asked. for0     He suggestedthat we should say that we accepted the principleof self-determination, but that we would, not enterinto negotiations (or, perhaps, that we would not agree to the Plebiscite being held) until the german army had been demobilised.     No one was particularly anxious to embark on war on behalf of Czechoslovakia;but he for his part was prepared to face war inorder to free the world from the continual threat ofultimatums.If-we took any steps which meant that theCzechoslovakian Government lost their presentfrontiers, we must be prepared jto give that country a guarantee.
Up to the present time neither the Sudeten Germans m%r Germany had made any concessions.They must he prepared to make some concession ifwe were to reach an honourable settlement. If,on the other hand, we reached a settlement whichlooked like a surrender to force, it was doubtfulwhether the Government could carry this policy in theHouse of Commons or in the country, and we should do irreparable damage to our prestige.     His main point was that if we took a decision to acceptHerr Hitler&apos;s terms without obtaining a quid pro quo,that would represent an abject surrender.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said thatthe Government had decided some time hack that,they would not fight for Czechoslovakia, but thatthey would go to Prance&apos;s assistance, if Prance werethreatened.      That attitude should influence theCabinet&apos;s decision today.      If Prance was notprepared to fight Hitler      prevent the Sudeten Germans entering the Reich, there was nothing whichwe could do, or should be called upon to do.It was in our interests to prevent any singlepower dominating Europe;    but that had come to pass;,and he thought we had no alternative but tosubmit to what the Lord Privy Seal regarded ashumiliation.      In his view we should accept theposition laid down by the Prime Minister, thatwe should try to negotiate the best terms obtainable.We must obtain a decision from Prance whereby thatcountry would put the maximum pressure on M. Benes. .
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP lancaster said that he was profoundly disturbed by the lord president of the Council&apos;s remarks.:   He thought the Lord President&apos;s arguments could equally beused to justify acquiescence in the invasion ofKent or the surrender of the Isle of Wight.      Itmust be remembered that not only had Herr Hitlerasked for the return of the German colonies twoyears ago but that even before the war germany had been dissatisfied at the extent of hercolonial empire.It was true that there was no profit in war,but sometimes war had to be faced,, since otherwise the alternative was to become a vassal state.In his opinion the issue now before the Cabinetraised the same issue as had been raised in 1914swhen Belgium had been invaded.      There was hardfibre in the British people which did not liketo be told that, unless they acquiesced in certainthings, it was all up with them.Looking at the matter from the Parliamentarypoint of views he strongly hoped that the actionagreed upon would not be represented as a puresurrender to force.      At the time of Mr. Eden&apos;sresignations it had been stated that Mr. Edenhad left the Government because it had yielded toa threat of force, and nothing had been more effect-tive than the Prime Minister \s statement that thiswas not the case.      if Germany continued to keepher troops mobilised, then our action would berepresented as a surrender.      It was essential thatGermany should make some concession..    For example,he would like to see the date of the Plebiscitepostponed.     He agreed with what the Home Secretary,had said about the need for a guarantee.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said he hoped the Cabinet would realise the immensestrain on the Prime Minister in negotiating for hourswith Herr Hitler.      The two colleagues who had spokenlast differed as to the weight which should be givento the several realistic arguments which might bemarshalled in this matter.    He felt the extreme difficulty pf weighing properly the arguments produced by the Lord Privy Seal with those advanced by theLord President of the Council.He rather shared the views of the Secretaryof State for India that it was undesirable to burntoo much incense on the altar of self-determination.The most which he was prepared to say on the matter was that it was impossible to lead this country intoa war against this principle.He asked himself, was it possible to give theordinary man any reason to hope that in future, when thepresent affair had been dealt with, the temptation to aggression would be lessened, and there would befoundations for some better understanding between thecountries?     He agreed that the present affair containedan element of German blackmail but this should not:blind us to other considerations.     The Czechoslovakproblem must be looked at in its setting as a problem which was a thousand years old, and which happened tohave become active at the present time under the guiseof a Dictator1s blackmail.     He compared this problemagain to the stresses and strains at work below thecrust of the earth, which would result in an explosion
unless some relief were given,,     This led him to theview that unless these peoples could he separatedand divided up, the problem would never be solvedexcept by war.Many people talked of the provision in Articles XIXof the Covenant for the revision of boundaries, hutsuch revision could only he carried out in one ofthree ways - by consent;   by the threat of war;    or by war.     It was obvious that all Europe was at faultfor not having faced these problems in the last fewyears and obtained settlements by consento     his conclusions were fortified by Lord Runciman&apos;s viewthat no local solution was possible.     If thealternative to acceptance of the Prime Minister1sproposal was war, then, he asked himself, what wasthe ultimate justification for war?     In his view,he would fight for the great moralities which knewno geographical boundaries.     But there was no greater urge to fight for Czechoslovakia than to:- &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; Ifight Japan because of the bombing of civilians in Canton.      If the matter was looked at from thepoint of view of self interest, he would distinguish between the attack on Czechoslovakia and an attack,say, on the Isle of Wight.&apos;.As regards the view that if we did not havewar now we should have it later on, that was really the argument for a preventive war.     It was, however,impossible to forecast the future.     Moreover, the theory of a preventive war meant that we shouldhave a bad war every 20 years, in order to prevent- &apos;     &apos; MSa war from occurring five years later.     He had nodoubt that if we were involved in war now we shouldwin it after a long time, but he could not feel we
were justified in embarking on action which would resultin such untold suffering.To sum up his views, the Foreign Secretary thoughtthat we should accept the principle of the transfer ofthese peoples, but he thought that we should first do all we could to restrain aggression and to get herr hitler to say publicly that he would be satisfiedwhen he had obtained self-determination for the Sudeten Germans.     Secondly, that we should obtain the best possible conditions of transfer.     He rather doubted whether it would be desirable to postpone the transferfor long, since the intervening period would be toodangerous.     The transfer could not of course be effectedat lightning speed.     He hoped that the Prime minister would succeed in obtaining these conditions.As regards procedure it was very important thatwe should avoid allowing the French to say that they came to London and found that we had decided to give theshow away.     His principal anxiety concerned the positionin Czechoslovakia.     He thought we should increase thenumber of our observers there and do all we could toassist in keeping order.As regards a guarantee, he disliked the idea, but thought we should very likely have to concede it whenthe time came.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggested that in considering any guarantee to Czechoslovakia, that we mustbe careful about the area whose integrity we guaranteed.We must bear in mind the possibility that the Hungariansand Poles in Czechoslovakia would also demand a Plebiscite.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSconcurred.
THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that he hopedthis matter would not be discussed on the basis thatour honour was involved in maintaining the existingboundaries of the Czechoslovak state.    The present dispute v/as a very old one.    It was true thatwe had several times yielded to force in recentyears, but the root fault was that the League ofNations had- not been used as a basis for peacefulchange.    He thought that the Prime Minister&apos;personal visit to Herr Hitler had had enormousadvantages.    He had studied Herr Hitler&apos;s character as portrayed in numerous books about him, andhad reached the conclusion that Herr Hitlercombined an inflammatory temper with a cool, clearbrain in regard to certain simple -objectives.He referred to the various coups which herr hitler had carried out, and pointed out that infuture, with the exception of the Polish Corridor,his problems did not relate to territoriescontiguous to his own boundaries.No doubt we were in a very difficult position in that we were faced with constantdemands backed by marching men.    But his own view was quite plain, namely, that we must accept the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal, providedthat we endeavoured to secure satisfactoryconditions for the plebiscite.
There were, of course, certain things for which wewould fight, and if necessary, go down, rather than yieldon, hut in his view this was not such a case.    It would be necessary  to have a far more clearly-cut issue before weembarked on war..   He was sure the Prime Minister would havethe baching of all his colleagues.    The Prime Minister&apos;sendeavours to obtain a peaceful settlement had the almostdesperate goodwill of the whole world.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that he didnot agree with much that had been said by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Labour,    Likethe First Lord of the Admiralty, he regarded this question as almost as direct an attack upon us as, say, an attack onthe Isle of Wight.    This was not the last of Herr Hitler1scoups.    The present Nazi regime could not exist withoutcoup si.    If the choice for the Government in the next fewdays was between surrender and fighting, we ought to fight.His view was that the present was a better rather than aworse time to fight;    if the Government found themselvesdiscussing issues of peace or war six months or a yearhence on some such issue as the Polish Corridor,, or Memel,or the Colonies, the same points would arise.    By then,Germany&apos;s difficulties would have largely disappeared.    Ifit was a choice between surrender and fighting he wouldchoose the latter, provided we were supported by France.We must be prepared to tell France that, unless temmscould be devised which did not represent a mere&apos;surrender,we should support her.Continuing, the President of the Board of trade said that he did not think that this issue had yet arisen.He was rather less hopeful, now than he had been before theBerchtesgaden interview, and felt that we were virtually -faced with an -ultimatum.
Some people would say that even acceptance of theprinciple of the plebiscite would be regarded as a surrender but he did not take that view.     He thought thatthere were grounds which justified the acceptance of theprinciple of the plebiscite0Acceptance of the principle of the plebiscite was allthat the Prime Minister now asked for;    but he asked whetherit was fair to the Prime Minister to leave matters in this position.     For example, while he (the President of the Boardof Trade) would be satisfied with a plebiscite carried out under reasonable conditions, he would regard a plebiscitetaking place under the guns of an armed force of 1-g- million men as a surrender,.     There was every possible gradation between these two extremes.     He thought that several other Ministersshared his view and were ready to say that they were preparedto accept certain proposals for a plebiscite but that theycould not accept others0THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE pointed out that thePrime Minister had felt it impossible to mention conditions athis interview with Herr Hitler, but that at the second meeting hewould have to start negotiating conditions.     He thought that theCabinet should make certain, before the Prime Minister resumedthe negotiations, that he knew what conditions his colleagues would regard as acceptable.     He suggested that, whilst theFrench negotiations were being conducted, the Cabinet, or aCommittee of the Cabinet, should discuss this vital matter of conditions.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION said that he could-apt regard the question of the Sudeten Germans as
M. Benes had missed his opportunities so often that\ separation was now inevitable.    There was no reason why the Prime Minister should not discuss with herr hitler the conditions on which the plebiscite shouldbe held.    The problem of maintaining law and orderduring the plebiscite was the most difficult one wehad to face^vKoi ou^cclL^ e^e.c.h       coyvAt/Te^.s ^^&quot;cXTHE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT said that GreatBritain and Germany were the two greatest Powersto-day and Germany was greater than Herr Hitler.    Itwas impossible to keep down a country of 70 million people.    He thought that the present negotiationsmarked the beginning of a new era which would resultin Anglo-German understanding.    He favoured the resumption of negotiations on the basis of theacceptance of a plebiscite, with a view to the negotiation of satisfactory conditions.    He had no hesitation in supporting the course proposed by thePrime Minister.THE MINISTER   OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES&apos; thought the future was dark.    If a settlement on thebasis of self-determination was proposed he thoughtthat we could not oppose such a settlement by war.To the question posed in this way there could in his view be only one answer.    The country would be whole-heartedly behind the course of action proposed by thePrime Minister.Neither in his Nuremberg Speech nor in his conversations with the Prime Minister had Herr Hitlerused the word &quot;plebiscite&quot;. There must be some reasonfor this.    Was it that he hoped to secure that therewas no bar to the cession of these territories without a plebiscite? Or was it that he was not satisfied with a plebiscite that was
the only way out, and that he might possibly he satisfied with some cantonal solution.   Owing to their8 distressedeconomic position the Sudeten areas were not a prize tocovet.   Hie did not feel to the same extent as some of hiscolleagues, that our honour was implicated in the dispute^We had been careful never toeommit ourselves to take actionin the event of a dispute over Czechsolovakia.   The wisdom,of this course was now evident and we should act upon it.It would be very rash to intrude the Empire into aquarrel which was not our own affair.   He was quite clear in his own mind as to what our attitude should be.    IfPrance were drawn in then our interests were involved, but otherwise we should not allow ourselves to become involved.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said that he had listenedwith great attention to the Foreign Secretaryls remarks,and was not disappointed by the persuasive way in whichhe had stated his case.   Nevertheless, the arguments usedled him to fear   that we might be cloaking our realmotives.If in the course of the negotiations we were facedwith the alternatives of surrender or war, we must choose the latter.   He thought that we should-accept self-determination   as the basis on which to open negotiations,and that if we could induce Herr Hitler to produce some military detente we might reach a satisfactory position.If not, we should revert to some of the plans whichhad been brought forward to improve rmv military position,such as the mobilisation of the Fleet.   Herr Hitler couldnot object to this, as we could say that as he would notstep down from his preparations, which were greater thanours, we should have to increase our own.    If we did not
take such action, he thought tshat Parliament would becomehighly critical, on the grounds that we had taken no steps to convince Herr Hitler that there was a point atwhich we should withstand him.    If we were faced with an intolerable demand, it was our duty to oppose such ademand by war*He was all in favour of increasing the number ofObservers in Czechoslovakia *   Such a measure would be very valuable *3y force of circumstances we had been for cod. - sat othis question and had been obliged to take a leading part.Our prestige was now deeply involved.   Nor c^uld wewithdraw without breaking the national front, which was perhaps our greatest asset at the present time.   Bv^n theextreme Left were fully in accord with the action which wehad taken,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that we werenever committed to go to war on account Af Czechoslovakia,but we would have to go to war if Prance became involved.That, however, was quite a separate question from the merits of the present proposal.   He thought that we should acceptthe present proposal, provided that we could ensure thatthe transfer of population, was carried out-Underreasonable conditions.    He thought that we. should agree tothe transfer of the peoples who wished to be incorporated in the Reich, provided that we were not irretrievablycommitted to some particular method.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR&apos; AIR said that he supported the action proposed by the Prime Minister.   he did not think that the nation would support any actionwhich would involve ug&apos; in war in order to prevent theprinciple of determination.    It would, of course, be
necessary that reasonable conditions for a Plebisciteshould be laid down.      He thought that it was very necessary that we should look ahead and consider theposition vis-a-vis public opinion at home and abroad inregard to the decision now to be taken.    It was very desirable that we should enter into discussions with theFrench Government in this matter, but as soon as theFrench Government was informed, the position would become known and there might be an insistent demand to recall, . Parliament.    The view might be taken that, if Parliamentf.h. us (V?)3.was not recalled now; we should be hopelessly committedbefore Parliament had any chance of expressing its views in the matters the FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthere was almost no length to which he would not goto avoid war.   The Lord President of the Council had said that we should 2iU*^H*it 4% -o- * xasv**j *a*aa&amp;^ &apos; a^oC &amp;jl ,thought that this represented the position..   He reminded the Cabinet that at Wednesday1 s meeting he had said thatit was of the utmost importance that we should not offendFrance.    He hoped we had not done so.    We were in dangerof being accused of truckling to Dictators, and offendingour best friends.    He thought we should make it plainto France that we would fight rather than agree to anabject surrender, and that we should support the Frenchrather than attempt to put a brake upon their actions.
-   THE PRIME MINISTER said that his colleagues had accepted the principle of self-determination, andhad given him the support he had asked for;    he was most grateful to them.    One course would he for himto say no more,  and leave it at that;    hut he thoughtthat perhaps he had better say something in regardto the views that had been expressed.He had been somewhat surprised at the FirstLordfs conclusion,  as from his opening remarks hethought he was going to say that we must now standand fight.    It was not until the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sspeech that any of his colleagues had contemplatedactual hostilities.    He (the Prime Minister)recognised that in certain circumstances we shouldhave to fight, even if our armaments were weakerthan they were.    But in modern circumstances war was very different from what it was in 1914.    To-daywar affected the whole population.    He wished hecould show his colleagues some of the many letterswhich he had received in the last few days, which showed the intense feeling of relief throughout thecountry,  and of thankfulness and gratitude for the load which had been lifted,  at least temporarily.If at any time we were convinced that somevital British interest was at stake,  then,  of course,we should have to go -through with it;    but we shouldhave to be very fully satisfied that this was thecase.    The alternatives to-day were not betweenabject surrender and war.    Acceptance of theprinciple of self-determination was not an abjectsurrender.
In the account of his conversations with herr hitler he could not repeat every word which had passed.    No doubt it might be thought that at aparticular moment he should have used some rather different language, but in a single-handed conversa-tion it was necessary to act quickly.    Also, he hadbeen actuated by the desire not to say something which would force Herr Hitler to commit himself to something to which he had not committed himselfalready.    For this reason he had not asked herr hitler whether he thought that any other solution wouldbe preferable.We had agreed to accept the principle ofself-determination and had thus secured the onlycondition on which negotiations could be carriedon.    But that of course did not mean that we should give Herr Hitler a free hand.The comment made by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, on the fact that the word &quot;plebiscite&quot;had not been mentioned, was quite just.    It might bethat we should find that Herr Hitler said that he did not want to have any vote.    On the other hand,he might demand an immediate plebiscite.The Prime Minister said that it had neverentered his head that he should go to Germany and say to Herr Hitler that he could have self-determinationon any terms he wanted.    He would not assent to anysuch agreement.If, as had been suggested, he were, tosay now to Herr Hitler that he would not returnunless Germany demobilised, the only result would be that5 Herr Hitler would   order
his troops to march straight into Czechoslovakia.We might not like that position, hut there it was.If our rearmament programme had not progressedso far as it had, it would have heen impossiblefor him (the Prime Minister)  to have faced herr hitler at all.       It was only the fact that we had increased our strength and were no^ a formidablePower that enabled us to speak with any influence.The Prime Minister emphasised that the acceptance by the Cabinet of self-determination in principledid not mean any more than it said.The Prime Minister referred to recent telegrams from Czechoslovakia which showed that opinion was hardening against self-determination.This might result In precipitate action by herr Hitler which we should not be able to stop.The Prime Minister recognised that an attempt by herr Hitler to force the issue of self-determinationwithout proper arrangements was not a transactionwith which we should care to be associated.Nevertheless, he rather deprecated any attemptto tie his hands too closely by fixing precise limitsbeyond which he should not go, when he resumedthe negotiations.Another possibility, which he hoped would prove correct, was that, if we now accepted theprinciple of self-determination, Herr hitler would feel himself to some extent committed toan orderly.carrying-out of the principle.
When the negotiations came to the question ofprocedure, it would he necessary to provide conditionswhich would enable law and order to be preserved.     That-would prove a very difficult matter.Further, there still remained the question whetherit was possible tc make the change any less unpalatableto the Gzechoslovakians.     More than one Minister had said that we should have to give them a guarantee.     Onthis he agreed with the Foreign Secretary.     He dislikedthe proposal, as it involved a commitment in a distantcountry;    a cemmitment,   moreover, which we could not carry out effectively.      Its value would lie in itsdeterrent effect.     He thought, therefore, we could not exclude the possibility of giving a guarantee, for whioh.a good deal of support had been forthcoming at thismeeting.     The matter would; of course, have to beconsidered when the time came.     He had not proposed tomake any suggestion about a guarantee to Herr Hitler,at any rate at the present time.     Our next-st-ep uro-uldbe to have discussions with the French.After some further, discussion it was agreed that,while the Cabinet was in general agreement with theviews expressed by the Prime Minister, it was undesirable to record any conclusion until discussions with theFrench Government had taken place.It was also agreed that the Cabinet should hold,themselves available for a meeting at, say, two hours&apos;notice.     Owing to the discussions with the French,which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet were due to start at 11.0 a.m. on Sundaymorning, no meeting would be held on Sunday morning, andit was unlikely that any further meeting of the cabinet would be necessary until Monday morning.
bill the Prime Minister mentioned that he was seeing Mr.Herbert Morrison, M.P., Dr. Hugh Dalton, M.P. and SirWalter Citrine that evening.     He proposed to inform them of the upshot of his discussion with Herr Hitler;    hethought that he might ask them whether they thought thecountry would be prepared to go to war to prevent theapplication of the principle of self-determination.     Hewould not, of course, inform them of the general sense ofthe discussion which they had had in the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES mentioned thequestion of communication with the Dominions, and it wasagreed that a telegram should be despatched after consulta-tion between the Foreign Office; the Dominions Office andthe Prime Minister&apos;s Secretariat,It was also agreed that consideration of any furtherdefence precautions, e*g. naval mobilisation, should standover for the present,CONCLUSIONS *vTHE CABINET agreed -(1) To postpone recording any Conclusion onthe report made by the Prime minister on his visit to Herr Hitler until dis-cussions with the French Government hadtaken placeo(2) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should invite representatives ofthe French Government to come over to thiscountry as soon as possible for discussion,(3) That the discussions with the French should be conducted on the basis that we should endeavour to reach a joint decision with theFrench GovernmentaRichmond Terrace,Whitehall, S.W.1,17th September,- 1938a
