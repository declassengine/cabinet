THE INTER-national situation.conversations with Repre-sentatives ofthe FrenchGovernment.(previous reference:Cabinet 43(38).)THE PRIME MINISTER said that during the precedingtwo hours British Ministers had had conversations with,M. Daladier and M. Bonnet.     At the outset of the conversation he (the Prime Minister) had asked theInterpreter to read a Memorandum summarising his conversations with Herr Hitler.     M. Daladier had thensaid that the French Government had not received a copyof Herr Hitler&apos;s Memorandum until 10.30 that morning.A Meeting of the French Council of Ministers hadbeen held that day and had reached the followingunanimous conclusions:-(1)    They rejected the suggestion that theInternational Commission, the principleof which had been adopted in the jointFranco-British proposals, should be suppressed.      The French Government couldnot recognise Herr hitler right totake possession of the Sudeten German areas by force.(2)   They refused to agree to a plebiscitebeing held in the green areas in which herr Hitler recognised the existenceof a Czech majority.In the view of the French Government it was nolonger a question of   reaching a fair arrangement.Herr Hitler&apos;s object was to destroy czechoslovakia and to dominate Europe.The Prime Minister said that he had then elucidatedone or two points in regard to which the FrenchGovernment appeared to have misunderstood Herr Hitler&apos;sproposals.     He had pointed out that as regards transferof territory the proposal was that the red areas shouldbe taken over by Germany by agreement and not by force.Again, the   red areas corresponded broadly to theareas with over 50&apos;/o of German population which it hadbeen contemplated should be transferred under the Franco-British proposals for the cession of areas.     Further,M. Daladier seemed to have been in some confusion asto the precise functions of the international commission under the original proposals.-1-
M. Daladier had also seemed hot to have understoodthat while Herr Hitler had proposed that German troops should occupy the red areas forthwith, he had contemplated that a plebiscite should later be carried out within thosered areas.     He (the Prime Minister) had, however, heenunwilling to spend any considerable time in clearing upthese misunderstandings.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had then given thefollowing brief resume of the salient points of the conversation which followed:-&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER:   What do you propose to do next?M. DALADIER:    I propose that it should he suggested to Herr Hitler that he should return to theplan agreed upon last Sunday0THE PRIME MINISTER:    What will happen if Herr Hitlerrefuses?M. DALADIER:    I suppose that everyone will do hieduty.     I have no proposals to make.THE PRIME MINISTER:    Herr Hitler told me that his memorandum constituted his last word, and thatif he could not reach a peaceful settlementhe would impose on Czechoslovakia a frontierbased on strategic considerations.M. DALADIER:    In that case Germany will he guilty of an unprovoked aggression,THE PRIME MINISTER:    Would Prance then declare war?M. DALADIER:    Prance would fulfil her obligations of assistance.&quot;Questions had then been put to ascertain whether Pranceprojiosed to man the Maginot Line and to take no further action, or whether she proposed to embark on hostilities withGermany by making full use of her land, forces, M. Dalsdier had saii
that he could, not discuss technical questions, hut thatPrance&apos;s future action would depend on many things.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had pressedM. Daladier a good deal on this.    Finally, M. daladier had said that it would he ridiculous to mobilise alarge force of men and to leave them doing nothing.   TheGerman fortifications opposite the Maginot Line were not as yet very solid, and he thought that France could trya land offensive, after a period of concentration.   Like-wise in regard to the air he had said that it would, ofcourse, be possible to use the French Air Force against certain military and industrial centres in Germany.At a later stage in the conversation M. daladier had said that while the French Air Force was inferior tothe German Air Force in materiel. its -personnel was good.He had also spoken encouragingly of the Russian Air Force,which, he said, was as good as the German.    Russia had5,000 aeroplanes and in M. Daladier&apos;s view the Russianaeroplanes had been a match for the German machines in spain.    He had also referred to the strength of theBritish Navy and the possibility of a blockade.M. Daladier had then said that in his view thereal question was this.    Herr Hitler had stated that hehad said his last word.    Did we accept that position?    Ifwe favoured its acceptance he thought that at least weshould send for the Czechs and hear what they had to saybefore they were sacrificed.   Finally he had put three questions to the Prime Minister:(l)   Does the British Government acceptHerr Hitlerrs plan?(2)   Does the British Government intend to press the plan on the CzechGovernment?(3)   Does the British Government think
that France ought to take no action?To these questions the Prime Minister had repliedas follows:-(1)   It was for Czechoslovakia, and not for this country or France, to acceptor reject Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals.(8)   We had received a message from the czechoslovak Government which did not represent their complete reply.     Itwas clear, however, that the nature ofthe interim reply was an unqualified refusal.In any case we were not in a positionto put pressure on the Czechs.(5)    He was not sure that it was for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to answer thisquestion, hut it was clear that whatever decision the French Government arrived atmight affect us.      It was not for us to say what action France should take, hut itwas important to know what France intendedto dooHaving regard to the evasive nature of the repliesof the French Ministers to our questions as to their military plans, the Prime Minister had suggestedthat General Gamelin should he invited to visitEngland on Monday, as it was imperative to ascertain whether the French really intended to carry out anyserious offensive hostilities against Germany.General Gamelin was in a position to speak on behalfof all France&apos;s three Fighting Services.The Prime Minister added that he thought it was significant that never once had the French put thequestion &quot;If we go to war with G-ermany will youcome in, too?&quot;THE HOME SECRETARY said that M. Daladier had beenvery anxious to find some alternative suggestion.     Hehad proposed that an International Commission should besent out at once, and should start allocating the predominantly German areas to Germany, thus giving to the cession the respectability   of an International.Commission.     He had thought that the commission might be set up in three days and might complete-4-
its work in ten days.     He contemplated that the wholebusiness should proceed very quickly and that theGerman troops should move in as the work was completed.In reply to the Secretary of State for Air THEPRIME MINISTER said that no clear indication had beenobtained as to the Prench Cabinet&apos;s intentions.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat M. Daladier had used the phrase &quot;Drawing thebulk of the German Army against France so as to relieve the pressure on Czechoslovakia.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that,judging by the account that had been given to theCabinet, the British Ministers had appeared to havecontested the French point of view on every point andto have allowed it to appear that they disagreed withthe Prench Government&apos;s suggestions without making any positive contribution themselves.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he could not accept this.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thathe thought the French would man the Maginot Line andwould then launch attacks on Germany.     Germany was bound to regard such proceedings as a hostile act and war would necessarily follow,THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked whether it was fair to summarise the French Government attitude as follows:that they considered the German Memorandum unacceptable:that if Czechoslovakia rejected it and Germany attackedCzechoslovakia, that would be an unprovoked aggression,and that the French would in consequence then take some action?THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR pointed out that theFrench Council of Ministers had met that day forthree hours, and it seemed that they were undecidedwhat they would do.     He thought that the Frenchidea was to keep Germans&apos;&apos; guessing, in the hope thatEurope would take the view that France, wasfulfilling her obligations by keeping a large numberof German troops immobilised opposite the french frontier.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that M. Daladier and General Gamelin hadbeen in consultation for several hours that day.He thought that General Gamelin could not givethe answer to what was strictly a political question,namely what decision the French Government would take if and when hostilities broke out.     Further, itwould be impossible to cross-examine him on strategicalissues, or, indeed, to go beyond the point of obtaining a definite assurance that the French Forces were in astate of readiness for war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had a furthersuggestion which he would like to communicate to theCabinet.      It was now clear that Czechoslovakia had decided to reject Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals, and it wasnecessary to consider transmitting that refusal toIlerr Hitler.     As matters stood, Herr Hitler would marchinto Czechoslovakia, and we should then have to see whatPrance would do.     He was unwilling to leave unexploredany possible chance of avoiding war.     He suggested that,basing himself on the personal conversations he had had with Herr Hitler, he should write a personal letter to theFuhrer saying that he had received intimation that thePrague Government were likely to reject Herr Hitler&apos;sproposals and making one last appeal to him,
H He proposed to ask him to agree to the appointment of a JointI Qomuiission, with German and Czech members and a british representative.      This Commission v/ould not start de novo, but wouldB consider how the proposals accepted by. the present Czech^ Government could be put into effect in an orderly manner and asif quickly as possible, and without shocking public opinion.     This11 further move would once more demonstrate to the world how hard weem had tried to preserve peace. If it was unsuccessful, we should losenothing by it, and it would help to consolidate world opinion inour favour,.     It might also help to rally the Dominions to our side.There was a chance that it would be accepted, although he could notpretend that he thought it was likely to be accepted.The Prime Minister said that his idea was to send this letterby Sir Horace Wilson and Sir Nevile Henderson,     Sir Horace hadbeen at the recent conversations and had himself talked to herr hitler, and he would go as the Prime Minister*s Confidential Adviser.,He thought that it was out of the question for him (the PrimeMinister) to make a further visit to the Fuhrer.If the letter failed to secure any response from Herr Hitler,Sir Horace Wilson should be authorised to give a personal message from the Prime Minister to the effect that if this appeal was refused, Prance would go to war, and that if that happened it seemed -certain that we should be drawn in.The Prime Minister said that it was just possible that therewas some element of bluff in Herr Hitler&apos;s attitude, but the line,which he proposed would afford Herr Hitler a possible way out.   he proposed that his appeal should be published as soon as it had beenmade.     it was just possible that Herr Hitler might be induced totake the line that after his conversations with the British PrimeMinister he was prepared to adopt that very magnanimous attitude.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that if the PrimeMinister, with his knwoledge of Herr Hitler, thought that this coursew^s a useful one, he thought the Cabinet should act on it.     herr hitler was proposing to broadcast on Monday evening and actionftust be taken at once before he made his broadcast speech.
THE FIRbT LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY thought thatwe should say definitely to Herr Hitler that, ifthis appeal was rejected, the Czechs would fightand the French would come to their aid, and thatwe should come in on their side too.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was quite clear that this should not he said in his letterto Herr Hitler.      To do so would rule out allchance of acceptance of this appeal.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said he understood that the Czechs had asked us not to take any action pending their final reply.     He thought they might he playing for time.THE PRIME MINISTER and the FOREIGN secretary undertook to hear this point in mind.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL referredto the Report of the Chiefs of Staff submitted bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in whichit was pointed out that it was essential to have atleast 48 hours&apos; notice before we were engaged in hostilities.     He asked whether the present proposal was consistent with this requirement.THE PRIME MINISTER said he did not anticipate that the step now proposed would be followed byimmediate war.     He proposed to communicate thissuggestion confidentially to the French Ministers.,He felt sure that they would agree to it willingly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat he agreed entirely with the present proposal..
He thought it was of the utmost importance to useevery attempt to find a peaceful solution.      Further,such procedure was essential if we were to ensure theco-operation of the Dominions.      He referred to telegram No. 524 from Berlin reporting the attitudeof the representative of the South African Governmentin Berlin to the effect that the South african government could not regard war on the present issue as in any way justified.      v/e must watch carefully the possible effect on the British Commonwealth ofNations.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER agreedwholeheartedly with the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal.He added that he did not agree with the Secretary ofState for the Colonies as to what was likely to happen in South Africa.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY asked whetherit was proposed to give any indication that if this plan was not accepted, we should stand by Czechoslovakia.,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not proposethat anything should be included in his letter to herr hitler which looked like a threat.      Anything in theform of a threat would destroy any chance of acceptanceof the appeal.      It might, however, be possible toinclude in the letter some words to the effect that theconsequences of the rejection of the appeal could notbe measured.    As he had explained, however, he proposedthat Sir Horace Wilson should be authorised, if hisappeal -failed, to supplement it by an oral message from the Prime Minister.^HE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE and theMINISTER OF HEALTH expressed their concurrence in thecourse proposed.
THE PRIME MINISTER added that he proposed to givethe French Government an indication of the nature of the,.&apos; ;;?v&apos;:v:fc i&apos;V:;oral message which Sir Horace Wilson should, in the last;resort, give to Herr Hitler.      The precise wording of the message would, of course, have to depend in part uponthe fuller knowledge which we hoped to obtain of theFrench Governments intentions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he thoughtGeneral Gamelin would refuse to communicate details ofhis plans, unless he was sure that we were going toparticipate in their fulfilment.      General Gamelin had been in close touch with the War Office.     He thought itwould he necessary to consider carefully whether heshould be called into the consultations with ministers or whether he should consult with his opposite number,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.He concurred warmly in the Prime Ministers proposalfor a final appeal to Herr Hitler.    He wondered whether the psychological effect would he increased if we were to take further precautionary measures.      He again referred tothe urgency, in his view, for authority being now givento call up the A.A. Units of the Territorial Army.,THE PRIME MINISTER said that all we could hope toget out of General Gamelin was a statement that he had a plan, and that the question for determination was whetherFrench Ministers Would give authority to put the planinto effect.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he hopedit would be made plain to the French that a finalcommunication v/ould be addressed to Herr Hitler to theeffect that, if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia and Francewent to her support, we should go to the support of France.
CONCLUSIONS.The Cabinet agreed:(1)    That the Prime Minister should send a further letter to herr hitler by Sir Horace Wilson onMonday making an appeal to himon the lines proposed:(2)    To authorise the Prime Ministerto communicate the proposedplan in outline to the french delegation ( including an indication of the oral messageproposed) and to continue discussions with the french ministers on the lines suggeated.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.26th September, 1938.
