THE INTER- THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would firstNATIONALSITUATION. give his colleagues some account of the negotiations the Prime at Godesberg, which he would follow with anMinister&apos;second Visit       indication of his own views.      He thought it mightto Herr Hitler.he convenient after some discussion that evening(previous reference.: to adjourn until Sunday morning.Cabinet 41(38), Con- THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had arrivedelusion 1.)at Koenigswinter, opposite Godesberg, on Thursday-F/?./t-3(3&apos;*).     That afternoon he had crossed the Rhine to Herr Hitler&apos;shotel and had had a long interview with him. the onlyOthQ? people present being Dr. Schmidt, the interpreter,and Mr* Kirkpatrick, the First Secretary at Berlin,who had taken a note for the Prime Minister.     as usual, the discussion with Herr Hitler had been somewhat discursive, although this did not mean that herr Hitler was not a very astute dialectician.The Puhrer had started by saying that he didnot know what   were the proposals which the PrimeMinister had put to the Czechoslovak Government, andit had been necessary to explain to him the nature ofthese proposals.Herr Hitler had expressed appreciation of theefforts which had been made to reach a settlement,and had asked whether these proposals had in fact been submitted to the Czechs.     When he was; informedthat this had been done, he said he was sorry, sincethe proposals were not acceptable to him.This:, said the Prime Minister, had been aconsiderable shock to him.    It was, however, necessary,in considering Herr Hitler*s reaction to our proposals, to remember that he was possessed of an intense dislike of the Czechs.
mHe had lived among them for many years and had nofaith in them.     He had no confidence that they intendedto give effect in the proposals which, they had accepted.Any plan which did not result in handing over the sudeten-German territory to Germany at once, in his view merely gave the Czechs further opportunities forevasion and delay.     Herr Hitler had said in discussion that as a result of the incidents which were occurringdaily, and of popular feeling which had been raised to a point of exasperation, the situation was sodangerous that in his view it must he resolved atonce.     There was only one way in which the transfercould he carried out speedily and effectively withoutfear of outrages being committed on the Sudeten Germans.Herr Hitler had then proceeded to explain his plan.He had had a map prepared on the only equitable basis,namely, nationality.     He proposed that the Sudeten-German territory should be handed over to Germany atonce.     The frontier of the territory now to be handedover would not, however, be the final frontier, since that would be determined subsequently by ascertaining the wishes of the inhabitants,Herr Hitler had said that in his view, it was necessaryto take a general plebiscite - it was not quite clear whether he meant over the whole of territory to be provisionally transferred,or over large parts of it.The Prime Minister said that he had thought hedetected&apos;in this proposal a reference to the Polish andHungarian minorities.It would be convenient to explain at this point thatat a later stage in the discussions Herr Hitler had saidthat the question was complicated by ^he existence of these other minorities,   and that these minorities could not longer endure their, present situation-
Whereupon    the   Prime   Minister   had   intersectedthat;, in the Berchtesgaden conversations Herr hitler had taken the view that the Sudeten-German problem wasthe one urgent problem, and that he was not interestedin the other minorities0     To this Herr Hitler had replied that it was true that he could speak only forthe Sudeten-Germans, but he thought that the Polish and Hungarian minorities also felt their positionacutely.These minorities had also been t ouched on at alater conversation in connection with the proposed guarantee.     When the Prime Minister had said thatthe cession of territory would deprive the Czechs of strategic defences and that they must be given some additional security, the Puhrer had said that germany could not enter into a guarantee unless certain other powers were includedo     In this connection he had mentioned ItalynThe Prime Minister said that he had replied tothis that he had not asked Herr Hitler to enter intoa joint guarantee with other Powers,     He had fully realised that Herr Hitler would have objections to thiscourse.     He had hoped, however, that Germany would beprepared to conclude a non-aggression pact withCzechoslovakia,,To this Herr Hitler had replied that he couldnot conclude such a pact while the question   of theother minorities was still outstanding0     Theirrepresentatives had been to see him;    they had his sympathy,,and he could not stab them in the back.    It was, however,fair to point out that Herr Hitler had not taken the view which he had feared he might take, and insisted that asettlement of the other minorities must be linked with thesettlement of the Sudeten-German case.      In his lastconversation with the Prime Minister Herr Hitler had not even mentioned these other minorities0&quot;&quot;3&quot;
Returning to the main issue, Herr Hitler had saidthat from the date on which the Sudeten German areas were ceded to Germany, it would he necessary that lawand order should he preserved, and he proposed thatthe whole of the transferred areas should he occupiedby German troops.     In order to avoid any suggestionthat the plebiscite was influenced by improper pressure,he would withdraw the troops from the disputed areaswhile the plebiscite was taking place.     Novemberhad been suggested for the plebiscite.The prime Minister said that he had replied thatthis was an impossible proposal.     Public opinion would not regard occupation of the transferred areas by German troops as acceptable in present circumstances and would view such occupation as the seizure of aconquered territory.     Herr Hitler replied that he did not see why objection should be taken.     It had then been suggested that they should examine a map of theterritory which Herr Hitler suggested should betransferred to Germany, and they had proceeded to aroom downstairs where they had been joined by sir nevile Henderson, Sir Horace Wilson and Herr von ribbentrop.The Prime Minister said that he had been relievedto notice that the area on this map did not appearvery different from the 50% area marked on the mapswhich had been examined in this country.     On herr hitler&apos;s map certain areas in Czech territory wereshaded and he proposed that these areas should also he the subject of a plebiscite.     Herr Hitler took theview that the country had been deliberately Czechised-and that, following the Saar precedent, only persons resident in each area in, and before, 1918 should beentitled to Vote.
Continuing, the Prime Minister said that the conversations were continually interrupted by messagesbrought in at opportune moments reporting fresh outrages,which generally proved to he quite false.     At thispoint in the conversation such a message had been brought in, and the Prime Minister had asked Herr Hitler whether he would not appeal to the Sudeten Germans not to provokeincidents.     He (the Prime Minister) would likewise make an appeal to Czechoslovakia.     Herr Hitler had repliedthat the Sudeten Germans were unorganised, that their leaders had been arrested or had fled the country andthat he could not control them.     He had, however, agreedto the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion that he should issue an appeal to his own people, and in the Prime Minister&apos;spresence he had sent for General Keitel and given himan order to this effect.At this point the conversation had ended, and thePrime Minister had returned to his hotel and discussed the position with his advisers.     They had decided thatas discussions with Herr Hitler were of such a discursivecharacter, it would be desirable to have definite proposals from Herr Hitler in a written memorandum.     Accordingly,a letter had been sent to Herr Hitler.This letter had been circulated to the Cabinet(Telegram No, 4, from Godesberg to the Foreign Office).This letter had been despatched on Friday morning.On receipt of it, Herr Hitler had expressed somedisappointment to Herr von Ribbentrop, and had said thathe thought the Prime Minister had come to talk to him and not to write letters.     The Fuehrer had, however,decided to send a written reply, and accordingly thearrangement to resume the conversation at 11.30 a.m. hadbeen cancelled.The reply to the Prime Minister&apos;s letter had been-5-
promised before lunch., hut in the event it was not received until about 4 o&apos;clock.      (This reply had alsobeen circulated.      See Telegram No. 5 from Godesbc-rgto the Foreign Office).The reply showed unmistakable traces of Herr Hitler&apos;sstyle, and was largely a repetition of the speeches hehad already made at Nuremberg and elsewhere.      The tonewas not as courteous or considerate as one would wish,but it was worth remembering that Germans were apt toexpress themselves curtly.     Although in his conversations with the Prime Minister Herr Hitler had occasionallywaxed indignant about some subject, he had always spokencourteously.Herr Hitlerrs reply had in effect set out the plan which had been explained the previous evening.     in considering what step should next be taken, the PrimeMinister explained that he had thought it important thatwe should not allow ourselves to be put in the positionof acting as spokesman on behalf of the czechoslovak government.     The Prime hiniater&apos;s position at Godesbergwas to act as an intermediary, and not to give approval to any particular basis of settlement.     He had,  therefore,decided that the best plan was to reply to Herr Hitlerby a further letter.     The Prime Minister then read outthe reply which he had sent,      (A copy of this letter is appended to these Minutes as an annex.)The Prime Minister explained that in writing this letter he had two main purposes.    The first was to getdetails in writing of Herr Hitler&apos;s proposal, which hecould forward to Prague.     The second was to obtain anextension of the assurance he had. obtained at Berchtesgadenthat Herr Hitler would not attack Czechoslovakia whilenegotiations were continuing.    In this connection he had. inmind that, on advice received from the French and british governments,  the Czechoslovak Government had. hithertorefrained from general mobilisation.
The Prime Minister pointed out that he had secured a continuance of this assurance and that Herr hitler had given his word that he would not attack Czechoslovakiauntil a reply had been received from the czechoslovak government.     No particular date had been specified forthe receipt of the reply.In reply to a question from the Foreign secretary the PRIME MINISTER said that he assumed that, as we had communicated Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals to the czechoslovak government, they would reply to us and not direct to herr Hitler.A third purpose which he had in mind in writingthis second letter was to indicate that he then proposedto leave Godesberg.     It so happened that Dr. Schmidt, theinterpreter, had mentioned to a member of the PrimeMinister&apos;s staff that he was not sure that our original proposal had been properly understood by Herr Hitler,The latter had thought that under our proposal noterritory was to be transferred until the whole area to be transferred had been delimited.     The primeMinister had not based any great expectation on thepossibility that the immediate cession of some part ofthe Sudeten German territory would affect the negotiations,but he had thought that the point might be explored,and he had therefore asked Sir Nevile Henderson andSir Horace Wilson to take his second letter down to herr Hitler&apos;s hotel, with instructions that they should see Herr von Ribbentrop, and if possible Herr Hitler.
Herr von Ribbentrop had not agreed to Sir nevile henderson and Sir Horace Wilson seeing Herr Hitler,He had taken this suggestion to Herr Hitler and had theninformed Sir Nevile and Sir Horace that this suggestion was of no value.    Strategical considerations had been urged against it.     Herr von Ribbentrop had, however,said that Herr Hitler agreed that a Memorandum shouldbe prepared setting out the Fuhrer&apos;s proposals.Sir Nevile Henderson had also been asked to find out what arrangements should be made for the PrimeMinister to say goodbye to Herr Hitler.     It had finallybeen arranged that the Prime Minister and his advisers should go to Herr Hitler*s hotel at 10.0 p.m.     Theywould be given an opportunity of looking through theMemorandum in private, and it had been arranged thatif the Memorandum appeared to hold out no prospects offurther negotiations the Prime Minister should thensay goodbye to Herr Hitler.Accordingly, the Prime Minister said, he had returned to Herr Hitler&apos;s hotel about 10,30 p.m.Herr Hitler, who had been waiting for him on the steps of the hotel, had taken the Prime Ministerinto the lounge.     Those present at this interview^were the Prime Minister, Sir Nevile Henderson,Sir Horace Wilson and Mr. Kirkpatrick;   Herr Hitler,Herr von Ribbentrop, Dr. Schmidt;    and Dr. Weisaeckerfor the last hour of the conversation.
At this meeting Herr Hitler had heen far more cordial.He had begun by saying that he had not appreciated beforewhat tremendous efforts the Prime Minister had made toreach a peaceful settlement - efforts which involved notmerely physical exertion but political risks.    He expressed his gratitude for these efforts and said that if a peaceful settlement had been reached it would be largely due to thePrime Minister.    He hoped that there was now the prospectof reaching such a settlement.The Prime Minister had thanked Herr Hitler for what he had said and asked whether they could see the Memorandum(See Telegram No. 11 from Godesberg to the Foreign Office).The Memorandums which had been in German, was found to contain precisely the same proposals as had previously beenput forward.    Herr Hitler in a quiet voice had givendetailed explanations of the scheme and of the reasons forthe arrangements proposed.Meanwhile Sir Hevile Henderson and Sir Horace wilson had been reading through the Memorandum and informed thePrime Minister that it was an outrageous document, expressedin the most peremptory termss and demanding that theevacuation of the Sudeten German area by Czechoslovaktroops and police should start on Monday, the 26th september and should be completed a day or two later.The Prime Minister had thereupon said that, if thiswas the nature of the Memorandum* there was nothing for himto do, and he had half risen from his chair to leave.    Hehad spoken strongly of the folly of the risks which herr Hitler was running in insisting on these terms, and ofthe appalling loss of life and suffering which would ensue *suffering which would affect not merely the Sudeten Germansbut Germans now in the Reich.   He had reproached Herr Hitler;for having made no concessions, notwithstanding all that he(the Prime Minister) had done.-9-
Herr Hitler had replied that he had made someresponse to the Pi?ime Minister.     In effect he saidthat he had made, plans to invade Czechoslovakia(though he was careful never to use so direct a wordas &quot;invade&quot;) and that In that event he would haveconquered the country and would have drawn a frontiervery different from the frontier put forward in his present proposals:    the frontier would have been a strategic frontier instead of the nationality frontiernow proposed.      (This was confirmed by a remark madethe previous evening, when Herr Hitler had said thatwhen the Prime Minister had left Berchtesgaden he had never imagined that he (the Prime Minister) would obtain acceptance of the principle of self-determination,and that he had made his plans on that assumption.)The Prime Minister had thereupon told Herr Hitlerthat when the German Memorandum was communicated tothe Czechoslovak Government it would be made public and that it would produce a deplorable effect throughoutthe world.It had then been decided to go through theMemorandum, and the Prime Minister and his advisershad commented on the dictatorial language used.      (inreply to these comments Herr Hitler had pointed out,somewhat naively, that the heading of the document wasnot &quot;Ultimatum&quot; but &quot;Memorandum&quot;).The Prime Minister said that he had, of course, notsought to suggest amendments to the Memorandum.      Hehad, however, said that the points to which he particularly objected were the peremptory words &quot;german demands&quot; and the dates by which it was proposed thatevacuation should be completed.     Herr Hitler had
substituted, &quot;proposals&quot; for &quot;demands&quot;, and lie had struckout the original proposal as to dates and substitutedtherefor the proposal that the evacuation should becompleted by the 1st October.     Further, he had renewedhis assurance that, while the negotiations continued, hewould not attack Czechoslovakia.At this point in the conversation a message hadbeen brought in to say that the Czechoslovak Governmenthad decided on general mobilisation.     Herr Hitler had said that this settled matters, but the Prime minister had pointed out that the Czechs were only acting in self-protection.      In the course of further discussionHerr Hitler had said that he would answer the Czechmobilisation by calling up certain other classes.     Hewould, however, abide by his assurance that he would notinvade Czechoslovakia while the negotiations continued.The Prime Minister had said that he would send theMemorandum to the Czechoslovak Government, who wouldprobably consult with Great Britain and France.     It wasalso necessary that he should report to the French assoon as possible.The Prime Minister then gave his colleagues his views on the position.      On the first day at Godesberghe had felt indignant that, notwithstanding the fact thatthe self-determination of the Sudeten-Germans had beenagreed, to, Herr Hitler was now pressing new demands on him.     After further conversation with Herr Hitler,however, he had modified his views on this point.     Inorder to understand people&apos;s actions it was necessary to appreciate their motives and to see how their minds worked.&apos;In his view Herr Hitler had certain standards. (He now spokewith Greater confidence on this point than after his first visit).
Herr Hitler had a narrow mind and was violently prejudiced on certain subjects^   hut he&apos;would not deliberately deceive a manwhom he respected and with whom he had been in negotiation, andhe was sure thatJHerr Hitler now felt some respect for him.When Herr Hitler announced that he meant to do something it was certain that he would do it.      In the present instance herr hitler had said that if the principle of self-determination was accepted he would carry it out.      The Prime Minister thoughtthat he was doing so, although he had odd views as to the properway to give effect to the principle.     He did not believe that herr Hitler thought that he was departing in any way from thespirit of what he had agreed to at Berchtesgaden.The Prime Minister was sure that Herr Hitler was extremelyanxious to secure the friendship of Great Britain.      The crucial question was whether Herr Hitler was speaking the truth.when hesaid that he regarded the Sudeten question as a racial questionwhich must be settled, and that the object of his policy wasracial unity and not the domination of Europe.     Much depends onthe answer to this question.     The Prime Minister believed that herr Hitler was speaking the truth.Herr Hitler had also said that, once the present question had been settled, he had no more territorial ambitions in Europe.He had also said that if the present question could lie settledpeaceably, it might be a turning-point in Anglo-German relations.In speaking privately to him at the end of their last meeting,he had said that he would much like to have further talks withthe Prime Minister on other subjects of interest to Germanyand ourselves.On the question of colonies Herr Hitler repeated that thiswas not a matter of peace and war:    that there would no questionof mobilisation about this matter.
The Prime Minister said that he thought it would hea great tragedy if we lost this opportunity of reaching an understanding with Germany on all points of differencebetween the two countries t/ A peaceful settlement ofEurope depended upon an Anglo-German understanding.     Hethought that he had how established an influence overHerr Hitler, and that the latter trusted him and was willing to work with him     If this was so, it was awonderful opportunity to put an end to the horriblenightmare of the present armament race0     That seemedto hirn to be the big thing in the present issuerIn saying this, however, the Prime Ministercontinued, he was not unaware of the great difficultiesin obtaining acceptance of a solution on the lines proposed.     He must, however, make it plain that he saw no&apos;chance of getting a peaceful solution on any other lines.He hoped, therefore, that the Cabinet would examine very carefully the differences between the proposals made lastSunday and the present proposals, and would considerwhether those differences justified us in going to war.That morning he had flown tip the river over London^     Hehad imagined a German bomber flying the same course.   Hehad asked himself what degree of protection we could afford to the thousands of homes which he had seenstretched out below him, and he had felt that we werein no position to justify waging a war to-day in order,to prevent a war hereafter.The Prime Minister added that before leaving forGodesberg he had had some talk with Mr, Ashton-Gwatkinas to the ways of keeping order in the areas to betransferred, pending the delimitation     of the frontier,Mr. Ashton^Gwatkin had taken the view that.the best way of keeping order would be to have German troops in the whollyGerman districts and British troops in the mixed districts.
That was half way towards Herr Hitler rs proposal.     german troops were disciplined and could he controlled.     the czechoslovak troops could not he relied upon for thispurpose.   An international force was admirable in theory but.there was no time to organise it, and no one could say whatcountries could provide the troops0     Both Sir nevile henderson and MrQ Kirkpatrick had been strongly opposed to allowing the Sudeten Gemmans to police themselves.   their view, of course, was based on practical considerations and did not take into account the political difficulties involved.As regards the actual areas to be transferred to the reich, there was not much difference between Herr Hitier*sproposals and the areas which we had had in mind.   It had been pointed out to Herr Hitler that in doubtful cases he appearedto have given himself the benefit of the doubt.     His answerhad been? that he had agreed to a plebiscite aid would abide by the results of it.     He (the Prime Minister) hoped however-that his colleagues would not think that he was making anyattempt to disguise the fact that, if we now possessed asuperior force to Germany, we should probably be considering these proposals in a very different spirit.   But we must lookfacts in the face.If Czechoslovakia decided that she would fight, the result would almost certainly be that in future there would be noCzechoslovakia as it existed to-day or as it might exist if thepresent proposals were accepted.     If we were now to have recourse to force it would not be for the purpose . ofmaintaining Czechoslovakia in its present form (that wasimpossible), but because we thought that we could checkHerr HitlerVs ambitions more effectively by war now than by war hereafter.     We must not lose sight of the fact that war to-day was a direct threat to every home in the country, andwe must consider whether the protection which we could afford to-day to the people of this country against German bombs was as effective as the protection which we might be able to offerin the future -14-
THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR WAR asked what theposition would he if the Czech Government rejected the proposals. Should we still hold out the hand of friendship to Germany?THE PRIME MINISTER said that if war broke out,we should not hold out the hand of f riendship toGermany.      If the French decided to backCzechoslovakia the next point would be to ascertain what action they proposed to take to give effectto their treaty obligations,      The position in thisrespect was unchanged.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that before the Czechoslovak Government replied, theywould probably ask for advice.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in this connection it would be very desirable to have consultations with the French Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Prime Minister had suggested that heshould telegraph to the French Government to invitethem to send representatives to London to see thePrime Minister.     On reflection, he had felt thatthere were certain objections to this course-..   It might be difficult for French Ministers topay a second visit to us so soon, and the impressionmight be given that there was some sinister plotafoot to put further pressure on the Czech Government.He attached particular weight to the latter argument
Another suggestion was that there might he athree-cornered, discussion-between the French,ourselves and the President of the Czech Republic-,which conversation might possibly be held in Geneva.Doubts were pressed whether M. Benes couldleave his country at this juncture.On the whole, the Foreign Secretary thought thatthe safest plan would be to communicate an accountof Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals to the French government through our Ambassador in Paris and say that we were at the disposal of the French Government if they wished to discuss the proposals.After discussion in which it was pointed outthat it was necessary to lose no time in startingconversations with the French, it was agreed that theForeign Secretary should be authorized to communicate with the French Government in the sense proposed byhim in the preceding paragraph.In connection with the attitude of the FrenchGovernment, the PRIME MINISTER read telegram 292from Paris which had just been received.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that ifCzechoslovakia was being violently attacked byGermany, he felt sure that public opinion would bring about a position in which we should have to intervene in the war.      He feared, however, that unless we acted promptly that intervention might come, too late to be effective.     Herr Hitler stilldid not believe that this country would, in any circumstances, go to war.
As regards the promises which Herr Hitler had made to the Prime Minister, he did not feel thatconfidence could be placed in them, having regardto the previous statement which Herr Hitler had made, and to which he had not adhered.,     He was afraid that, after the second jp-ebuf^ which herr hitler had delivered to the Prime Minister, theHouse of Commons and the country would not acceptthe settlement proposed.      What then would becomeof the influence which the Prime Minister had established over Herr Hitler?     He was certainthat Herr Hitler would not stop at any frontier whichmight result from the proposed settlement.Continuing, the First Lord said he was sure that Czechoslovakia would now fight and he thoughtthat our right course was to order general mobilizationforthwith.     This would make our position clear tothe German Government and might yet result indeterring them from war.In reply to questions by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence, the First Lord said thathe proposed that we should mobilize as a precautionarymeasure, while the Czechs were considering Herrr Hitler&apos;sproposals.      If we went to war, his proposal was thatwe should rely on the weapon of the Naval  Blockade.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat, before reaching a decision, he would like to study the memorandum containing Herr Hitler &apos;s proposals in order to see how far those proposals could besaid to rest on any principle.This suggestion met with general approval.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR referred to thereport of the Chiefs of Staff dated 23rd September,^/C.P.207 (38)^/ in which they urged the importanceof early mobilization.     A number of measures ofreinforcement which were now being carried out,would be prejudiced if mobilization was to takeplace in the immediate future.     There were alsoa number of measures which should be carried outin Palestine and Egypt, if the danger of war was imminent.     He also referred to the position of certainbattalions in the Far East.Again, an interval of 48 hours was necessary before the Anti-aircraft Artillery and Searchlightscould be fully deployed.     This portion of theTerritorial Army could be embodied by a proclamationsigned by himself without general mobilization.He thought that action on our part by way ofmobilization might deter Herr Hitler.     Further,we should not be forgiven if some sudden attack was made upon this country and we had failed totake the necessary steps to put ourselves in a properstate of protection.On the general issue, THE MINISTER OF HEALTHsaid that a good deal would depend upon the attitudeof the Czechoslovak Government.     He thought,however, that it should not be assumed, either thatthe Czech Government would accept the proposals, or that if they rejected the proposals we should take no action.     He was, therefore, in favour of taking the steps suggested by the Secretary of State for War.
1 9 K!I 5 I)THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thatthese defence measures should he considered on the ensuing day.     The action to he taken in regard tothem depended ultimately upon what decision wastaken in respect of Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals.Further, he did not think that we should find ourselves at war, unless we ourselves first declared war.     He did not think that the matter was sourgent that a decision was required that night, andhe thought it should he postponed until Sunday.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER thoughtthat if the Czechoslovak Government refused HerrHitler1s proposals, public opinion would insist upon this country taking action which would involve usin war.     He was afraid that, unless we were prompt,any action which we took might come too late.     He,therefore, thought that the Cabinet should considertaking further defence preparations at the meeting to be held on Sunday.     He feared that Germany was quite capable of attacking us at an hour&apos;s notice.THE SECRETARY OF S TATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that while he recognised the force of whatthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had said,he thought there was much to be said on the other side.     To mention one point only, he was convincedthat Germany would do all she possibly could tokeep us out of war.     He, therefore, thought thatthe right course was that we should make up our mindson our general policy, before deciding on mobilization.
THE MINISTER FOR GO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCEmentioned that he had -understood from the Chief ofthe Air Staff that Germany could not start a heavybombing attack on this country unless she eitherconcentrated her bombing squadrons in north-west germany, or flew over Holland and Belgium.     Thelatter course would involve an infringement of neutrality, while the former concentration wouldinvolve some delay.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, duringthe Prime Minister1s absence he had been coming tothe conclusion that a decision should be reached at an early date in regard to further defence preparations.     It was essential that there shouldbe an interval between the dates when the Preparatoryand Precautionary Stages were instituted, and thedate on which we embarked on hostilities.     Hethought, however, that the interval required for essential measures (though falling short of theperiod of fourteen days or so which would be desirableif it was possible) could be secured on the basisproposed by the Prime Minister.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theBoard of Admiralty had taken all the precautionary measures possible, short of general mobilization.He thought that our naval position was reasonablysecure.     Nevertheless, he favoured general mobilizationas the only way of impressing Herr Hitler.     He also suggested that steps should be taken to consult with egypt under Articles 6 and 7 of the Anglo-egyptian treaty, with a view to bringing into force the precautionary measures necessary for the defence ofthe Suez Canal.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that considerationof this measure could be deferred until after adecision had been reached on the issue of generalpolicy.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES also thoughtthat it -would he -desirable to postpone a decision on further defence precatitions until a decision had beenreached on the broad issue of policy.      If we decide to mobilise now, the Czechoslovak Government might deducetherefrom that we had reached a conclusion, which we hadnot in fact reached.     He would also like time to study the Memorandum and the map, and to consider the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he &quot;thought that it might be helpful if he indicated the. main points of difference between the proposals agreed between the British and French Governments on the previousSunday and Herr Hitler&apos;s present proposals.As regards areas the difference was not great.The provisions ons dealing with options and minoritiesremained in Kerr Hitler&apos;s proposals, although they werenot specifically referred to.     There was no provisionfor a plebiscite in the proposals accepted by the czechoslovak Government, but Herr Hitler&apos;s proposalsprovided for a plebiscite under the auspices of anInternational Commission in certain areas still to be defined:    and for the German troops to be removed duringthe plebiscite period.The real difference lay in the fact that underHerr Hitler&apos;s proposals German troops would move inalmost immediately.      There was also provision for thedischarge of all Sudeten-German conscripts and Police,who should be allowed to return to their homes.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR pointed out that the provision that persons who were not in the area in 1918 should not he entitled to vote under the plebiscite made the plebiscite a much more difficult operation to carry out.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS repliedthat M. Masaryk, the Czechoslovak Minister in London,had seen the proposals and had raised strong objectionsto them.-   He said that the Czechs would sooner go downfighting than accept them.    The Foreign Secretary had replied that he understood the feeling of bitterness inthe Czechoslovak people, and that after   the pressure whichhad been exerted upon the Czechoslovak Government toaccept the previous proposalss the British Governmentwould be unwilling to urge further sacrifices.    At thesame time it would perhaps be right to consider whatwas the alternative course and where the frontiers ofthe country would ultimately be drawn on the conclusionof the war if war now broke out.    He had ended bysuggesting that the Czechoslovak Government should take their time before reaching a decision.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY asked whether theinclusion of France, Russia and ourselves in a joint guarantee had been mentioned in the conversations atGodesberg.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Russia had not been mentioned^THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS said that, .without suggesting that the argument told one way.or theother, he thought it was important to bear in mind thatif Herr hitler proposals were accepted by the czechoslovak government our guarantee must come into force at once.    In effect, we should say to Herr Hitler
CONCLUSIONS,thats if he attacked. Czechoslovakias Prance5 Russiaand ourselves would at once make war upon him.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the question of the Polish andHungarian minorities.      If it was agreed that theguarantee came into force at once5 he thought thatthat might he coupled with some condition suchas that the Polish and Hungarian minorities question should be submitted to arbitration within a specified period.     He thought that it was impossibleto leave these questions as they stood.The Cabinet agreed -(l)   To adjourn discussion of the proposals submitted by Herr Hitler until10.30 a.m. on Sundays the 25th September.(2)   That discussion of further defence measures^ including general mobilisationshould be postponed until a decisionhad been reached on the policy to beadopted in regard to Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals,(3)   That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised tocommunicate Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals tothe French Government and to indicatethat His Majesty&apos;s Government wereavailable for immediate consultationif the French Government so desired.Richmond Terrace,, S.W.I.,24th September9 1938.
