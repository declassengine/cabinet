IbchoslovakiAoInane ialfsistance to.EfeviousReference:[Cabinet 47 (38).)-511.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had asked the Cabinet to meet at short notice in orderto discuss a letter from the Czechoslovak minister in London to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP. 213 (38)) on the subject of financialassistance to Czechoslovakia.     In this letterM. Masaryk asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to guarantee a loan of  30 millions,,     This sum was stated to be required for two purposes:    first, todeal with the immediate problem of refugees, ofwhom about 1,000,000 were expected to arrive inthe new Czechoslovakia within the next few days;secondly, to deal with tho establishment of a basis for the reconstruction of the country&apos;s economic life, which would be upset by the cession ofdistricts containing many industrial establishments.The Prime Minister said that he understood that this request of the czechoslovak government had been addressed to this country alone,but that the French Government had been informed ofit.The Prime Minister observed that thismatter had been the subject of consideration by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the foreign secretary, and that he was in general agreement withtheir views as to the answer to be given.      It wasimpossible to accept every statement made byM. Masaryk, much of which was necessarily based onguesswork.     Thus, as regards refugees, it was extremely likely that many of those who were nowleaving the ceded territories were doing so, not onaccount of anything which had happened to them, butfor fear of what might happen to them.     It was the
intention of the German Government to do their best to prevent incidents, and the Prime Minister thoughtit was quite possible that many of those who were now leaving the territories to be ceded would before long return to the homes from which they were flying in, such haste.     The Czechoslovak estimate of thenumber of likely refugees might, therefore, well prove to be excessive.The reconstruction of the country and the starting of fresh industries was not a matter whichcould be dealt with without a careful survey of theposition.     It was therefore too early to estimate theamount of financial assistance which the CzechGovernment would require.The Prime Minister said that he thoughtpublic opinion in this country would feel that it wasin accordance with our best traditions that this request should meet with a sympathetic response.He said that both the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Foreign Secretary agreed with him in thinking thatour response should be not only sympathetic butgenerous.The question of the precise form which ourresponse to this appeal should take was a difficult one, and no final decision had been reached in regardto it.     His own idea was that we should state ingeneral terms that we were prepared to come to the help of the Czech Government and to give that Governmentsuch immediate advances or credits as might be necessary.But a careful examination would be necessary before weeould deal with Czechoslovakia&apos;s permanent requirements in the new conditions.     He thought that we should offer to provide expert advice, and should undertake to formulate plans which would be submitted to the House ofCommons in Novembers
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thathe agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s conclusion^ andhe thought that we should he prepared, not only to actquickly, hut to make a statement on the subject in theHouse of Commons that afternoon.      If no such statement was now made, there was no doubt that we should be forcedlater on to make financial concessions to the czechoslovak Government, and it was undesirable thatsuch concessions should appear to be dragged out of us.The Chancellor said that he did not think thiswas an occasion on which this country need adopt anapologetic attitude.      It was not the case thatCzechoslovakia had any legitimate grievance against us.and that we owed her some compensation.      On thecontrary, the position was that a world war had been averted and thereby Czechoslovakia had been saved.The position as he saw it was thatCzechoslovakia was urgently in need of help, and it was right that help should be given by a big country to alittle country, that such help should be given on age ne rous s cale.As regards the method of affording financial help, there were considerable difficulties.     such assistance might take one of two forms.     It might takethe form of a free grant, which would requireParliamentary sanction or it might take the form ofa loan guaranteed by this country.     Such a guaranteewould also require Parliamentary authority.     Theposition was complicated by the fact that other countriesbesides ourselvea might join in the guarantee.
The Chancellor said that, on reflection,he thought that the stun to he made availableimmediately should be described as an advance, andnot as a gifto     He had discussed this matter on sunday, 2nd October, with his Treasury advisers andthe Governor of the Bank of England.     The Governorhad been anxious lest the announcement of a giftwould be taken as implying some consciousness of moral guilt, and preferred a guaranteed loan.     Hisother advisers had thought that the best plan wouldbe a combination of a gift and a guaranteed loan.Another factor was that it was not yet known what Germany&apos;s   attitude would be towardsCzechoslovakia&apos;s rights and obligations in the cededareas.     There were such questions as the adjustment of the Czechoslovak public debt, and payment inrespect of State property and obligations in theceded areas.      In this connection, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer mentioned that it would be necessaryto ascertain precisely what happened whenCzechoslovakia took over the areas in question fromthe Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end ofthe Great War,     He was under the impression that
the settlement arrived at had taken into account a substantial reparations claim against ex-enemy countries, and that the effect of the inclusion ofthis reparations claim had been that Czechoslovakiahad made no actual payment in respect of these areas.The Chancellor said that another argument infavour of an immediate advance was that this would help the Czechoslovak Government to regulate the currency position, which might otherwise becomedifficult.    He also added that, although the comparative smoothness with which the evacuation of the ceded areas had been carried out wasremarkable, the process was nevertheless one whichwould try the patience of the Czechoslovak people.Any offer of help from the British Governmentwould have an important effect in steadyingpublic opinion in Czechoslovakia.Replying to a question by the Secretaryof State for Air, the Chancellor said that thepresent proposal, was that an announcement shouldbe made that afternoon that a sum of money wouldbe put forthwith at the disposal of the czechoslovak Government,  and that the sum would bea substantial one.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he thought itwas essential to mention some figure of the amountto he available for relief purposes, even if thefigure could only be reached by guesswork.He thought that the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary should say to-day that they were putting
a figure of  X millions (X being a precise sum) atthe disposal of the Czechoslovak Government for relief work.    It v/as his view that relief work had better be dealt with by gift, and that the measuresof economic reconstruction should be dealt withby a guaranteed loan in which other countries should co-operate.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was perhapsunnecessary to attempt to settle all the issues involved immediately.    If we said to-day that we would give  X millions as a gift, some people would say that  X millions was not enough.That difficulty would be avoided if we said to-day that we were prepared to make  X millions availableimmediately, and more if necessary.    The final arrangements, however, would be a matter whichwould have to be gone into in detail.The Prime Minister added that he alwayscontemplated that we should to-day mention thefigure which we would make available, as animmediate advance.    He would, however, prefer notto commit himself to the proposition that the sum to be &quot;^immediately advanced should necessarily be agift.    He thought that that course would be disadvantageous in the present rather difficult situation.    The practical point was that the czechoslovak Government should know that a certainsum of money was immediately available.* THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA enquire whether it would be desirable that the sum of moneyto be made available should be described as thefirst instalment    of a guaranteed loan.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that it would be better to deal with thematter on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister.It was necessary that a sum of money should at once be put at the disposal of the Czechoslovak state to meet immediate necessities.    For the rest,the matter was best left over for furtherconsideration.    The Czechoslovak Government had only asked for a guaranteed loan.    On the otherhand, it might well turn out that the sum forwhich they had asked was too small.    For his part,he hoped that words would be used in the debate that afternoon which would not exclude thepossibility of a gift.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary saidthat he had been much impressed by the needfor doing something urgently.    He also thoughtthat it was of great importance that the matter should not he dealt with in such a way as to giveground   for the implication that this was paymentof conscience moneyoDiscussion then took place as to whatfigure should be mentioned in the Debate that afternoon as the amount of the immediate assistanceto be afforded by this country.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought thatthe figure should be  10 millions as an andvance for urgent needs.    At the same time, while notexcluding further grants at a later stage, it wasnecessary that we should not drift into a positionwhereby, the larger the total claims, the more wehad to pay.After further discussion,  in which it wassuggested that  5 millions might be adequate for
an immediate instalment, THE PRIME MINISTER said thathe thought that the figure to he mentioned in to-day&apos;s   -Debate should be  10 millions.    In the opening statementit should not be necessary to say more than that  10millions would be made available at once and that thisshould amply suffice for immediate needs.    During thepresent month the general requirements of the situation could be more fully explored.    If, during the Debate,criticism was raised on the ground that the amount of 10 millions was inadequate,  it could be pointed outthat this sum could always be supplemented if the need arose.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR asked whetherit was proposed that other countries should be associated with us in this matter.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it would be premature to deal with this aspect of the matter inthe Debate that afternoon, but the formulation of plansduring the next few weeks to set the CzechoslovakState on its feet again should certainly includeapproaches to other countries.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL asked whether anything had been said in the Munich Conference inregard to such questions as the financial adjustment in respect of the territories to be transferred toGermany.   ^THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had mentioned the matter to Herr Hitler, who had not responded at allfavourably.    He doubted, however, whether Herr Hitlerunderstood these&quot;&quot;questions, and for that reason it hadbeen provided in the Supplementary Declaration that financial matters, including currency questions; should
be referred to the International Commission.     Hisown view was that on merits it would probably be foundthat Germany should make some payment to Czechoslovakia,though he doubted if the sum would prove to be verylarge *The Cabinet agreed;(l)   That the Government Spokesmen in theforthcoming Parliamentary debate should be authorised to say -(a) That His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Governmentwere prepared to arrange for an advance of  10 millions to bemade immediately available tothe Czechoslovak Governmentfor their immediate needs,(The term &quot;advance&quot; shouldbe us^d as consistent with either a gift or a first instalment of a guaranteedloan,)(b) That careful examination of thewhole position would benecessary, (towards which wewere prepared to offer expert advice) before Czechoslovakia&apos;s requirements for economicreconstruction in the new conditions could be ascertained.(c) That this matter would be fullye-xplored during the present month, and that detailed proposals would be submitted toParliament in November.(S)   That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto reply on the above lines toM. Maaaryk&apos;s letter (CP. 213 (38)).(3)   That the proposal for a guaranteedloan should be approved in principlebut that the matter was one which required further examination froma number of points of view:    e.g., asregards the approaches to be made toother countries with a view to their co-operation with us in this matter.
SBCHOSLO-VAKIAo      2,      THE SECRETARY OR STATS POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS-oposed Lord said that the Lord. Mayor had informed him on thefayor&apos;s fund for-telephone the previous night that he had receiveda number of letters,-, enclosing cheques and. postalorders, suggesting the initiation of a Fund forCzechoslovakiacThe Foreign secretary said that he had informed the Lor:.:. Mayor that the question of affording financial assistance to Czechoslovakiawas one which might well &quot;be considered by theGovernment;; and he had asked the Lord Mayor to refrain from taking any action pending suchcons1aeration.In discussion it was pointed out that once it was known that the Government was making a grant,it was unlikely that there would be any substantial volume of subscriptions to the proposed Lord Mayor&apos;sFund.   . It was thoughttoos that the collection ofa small Fund would have a bad effect,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was ratherafraid that the opening of a Fund might have a bad effect on public opinion in Germany.    He thoughtthat it was impossible to tell the Lord Mayor thathe must not have a Fund:    on the other hand, heshould be warned of the nature of the statement whichthe Government was about to make that afternoon, andbe asked to consider very carefully whether, in thecircumstances,  it was worth while to &quot;Vpen a Fund.It was agreed that -the foreign secretary should be&apos; authorisedto inform the Lord. Mayor of theGovernment&apos;s decision, and topoint out the disadvantages of opening&apos;a Lord. Mayor&apos;s Fund.
OPOSED visit the LORDYOR OP LONDONBERLIN ANDME.3.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs mentioned, that the Lord Mayor of London wascontemplating a State Visit to the MunicipalAuthorities of Berlin and possibly of Rome.     he asked for the advice of his colleagues on the matter.The view was expressed that the making ofsuch visits in the immediate future would be somewhat premature, and the Foreign secretary undertook to communicate in this sense with theLord Mayor.
THE MUNICH 4, In reply to a question by the Minister of conversations.Health, THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hoped to spain.   -circulate at an early date a note of his further conversations with Herr Hitler.(previous THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY1 OP LANCASTERReference:^Cabinet       (38)    suggested that it might be desirable to have a conclusion 4.)further discussion before long on certain generalaspects of Foreign Policy arising out of theMunich Conversations.THE PRIME MINISTEK said that for the mostpart the Conversations were of general interest andcalled for no immediate decisions.      The only pointtouched on in the Conversations which might call for early action concerned Spain.      It was just possiblethat an opportunity might present itself forstopping the Spanish War before the winter.      he hoped that after a few days&apos; rest, it would bepossible to consider this matter.
EOT OFIOHhbement ONq&amp;ramme.5. THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked whether thePrime Minister was in a position to give anyguidance as to the line which his colleagues shouldtake in any speeches which they might make, asregards the possibility of limitation of armaments.He said that one view which was strongly held incertain quarters was that we must never again allow ourselves to get into the position in which we hadbeen in the last few weeks, and that every effort should be made to intensify our rearmament programme.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he hoped that nothing would be said which would preclude proper considerationof the need for such intensification.THE PRIME MINISTER said that while he did not dissent from the views which had been expressed,he would like to make his own position in the matterclear.     Ever since he had been Chancellor of theExchequer, he had been oppressed with the sense thatthe burden of armaments might break our hacks.     this had been one of the factors which had led him to theview that it was necessary to try and resolve the causes which were responsible for the armament race.He thought that we were now in a more hopefulposition, and that the contacts which had beenestablished with the Dictator Powers opened up thepossibility that we might be able to reach some agreementwith them which would stop the armament race.      It was clear, however, that it would be madness for thecountry to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way.     For the
time being, therefore, we should relax no particleof effort until our deficiencies had been made good.      That, however, was not the same thing as tosay that as a thank offering for the present detente,we should at once embark on a great increase in ourarmaments programme.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat he thought that? in recent weeks,, people inthis country had at last come to realise how dangerousthe situation was, and he hoped that nothing would bedone to change the position in this respect.      Heappealed to the Prime Minister to bring home to thecountry that we could not afford any relaxation ofour efforts.      Further, he hoped that whateveragreement might be reached in regard to limitationof armaments, we must not allow Germany to maintainher present superiority over this country in the air.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR invited hiscolleagues to visit the Air Ministry on a date to bearranged, in order to see certain information whichhad been prepared, showing the strength of german air forces available for offence against this countryin comparison with the strength of our air defence forces.     He undertook to arrange a suitable timefor the visit to take place,Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.3rd October, 1938.
