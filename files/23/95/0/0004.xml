INTERNATIONALTUATION.ltral Europe.echoslovakia.putation frome Nationaluncil of Labour.1.  THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Meeting washeld with the primary object of enabling him to give his colleagues   an account of the conversations whichhad taken place on Sunday between representatives ofthe   French Government and British Ministers.      Hewould like, however, first to tell the Cabinet aboutthe deputation from the National Council of Labour(consisting of Sir Walter Citrine, Dr. Hugh Dalton,M.P., and the Right   Hon. Herbert Morrison, M.P.)which he and the Foreign Secretary had received on saturday.The main object of the Deputation had been toenable the Prime Minister to give them information about the present position.      He had asked them whatuse they would make of information given to them,and had pointed out that it was of the utmost importance that details of his discussions with herr Hitler should remain secret for the present.Any information given to the Deputation must therefore be given upon that understanding.      this had been agreed to.The Prime Minister had then given theDeputation a summary of his conversations with theFuhrer.      The Deputation had been very conscious ofthe   declaration which the Trades Union Congress had recently made to the effect that the British, Frenchand Russian Governments should combine in tellingHerr Hitler very firmly the limits beyond which he must not go.      The Prime Minister had explained tothe Deputation the present attitude of the FrenchGovernment, and the position of the French defence forces.     This had come   as a profound shock to them.
The Deputation, had then enquired as to theattitude of Russia.     He had informed them that the FrenchGovernment had made enquiries of M. Litvinoff, who had replied that, under Treaty, the Soviet Government were onlyhound to come to the aid of France after Czechoslovakia had become involved in war on her behalf.     The RussianGovernment, therefore, proposed to take no action untilFrance had become involved in war, and then to takethe matter up at Geneva.     This news had come as an even greater shock to the Deputation, who had expressed theview that they had been misled by the public declarationsof the French.      They had enquired at what period adivergence had become apparent between the views of theFrench Government as expressed in public and in private,and they had been informed that it had been when thesituation had become critical.The members of the Deputation had then agreedthat the Declaration which had been made by the TradesUnion Congress put them in an embarrassing position, andthat they would not have agreed to it if they had knownthe true facts.The Prime Minister said that he had noticed thatthe Labour Party had since adopted a distinctly mildattitude, and he did not think that they were likely topress for an aggressive attitude on the part of thiscountry.     No further suggestion had been made by the LabourParty for summoning the House of Commons.

Bonnet had flown over early on Sundaymorning and that he and three of his colleagues had had a most exhausting day in negotiations that hadlasted &quot;until after midnight.The first Meeting had taken place at11 o&apos;clock, when he had given a full account ofhis conversation with Herr Hitler.     He had also told the French what Lord Runciman had said.Having indicated the position, he had asked themhow they viewed the situation and what they thought should he done.The French Ministers had replied in effectthat the Prime Minister&apos;s account was of great interest and that they were anxious to hear theviews of the British Government, who had &quot;by now had some days to deliberate over the position.To this the Prime Minister had replied that, sincethe French were bound by Treaty obligations and wewere*not, he thought that it was for the French toexpress their views first.      The french representatives in turn had found some means of passing the ball back into our court, and somatters had continued during the whole morning.Just before lunch, however, M. Daladier had saidthat the real question at issue was what we could do in order to ensure peace, while saving as muchas possible of the Czechoslovak State.       TheBritish and French representatives had thenadjourned for lunch.The Prime Minister said that on this occasion, as so often in international discussions,he had found that the darkest &quot;hour was before lunch-.
A number of useful confidential talks had taken placeover that meal.     M. Daladier had confided in him that, while he saw the most serious objection torecognising the general principle of self-determination,which would involve other Minorities, he thought thathe could get M. Benes to agree to a cession of territory in the particular case of the SudetenGermanso     M. Bonnet had told the Foreign secretary that the question whether the present difficultycould be solved turned on whether Great Britain was prepared to join in some form of internationalguarantee of Czechoslovakia,After lunch, the negotiations had proceededin a freer atmosphere, and the two id^as mentioned by Mo Daladier and M. Bonnet had been developedoThe French were wholeheartedly opposed to the ideaof a plebiscite, which they thought would plunge allEurope into chaos.      (It was worth while rememberingthat Herr Hitler had never mentioned the word&quot;plebiscite&quot;.)     From a practical point of view, a plebiscite presented enormous difficulties and a straightforward transfer of territory would be muchsimpler.A transfer of territory could, however, onlybe carried out if some guiding principle were firstlaid down, and the new frontier then delimited by aninternational, commission on the basis of that principle.     The new frontier could not, of course, bedrawn by reliance on some rule of thumb formula.The commission would  also have to take intoaccount geographical, strategic and economic conditions.Again, even when a new frontier had been laid down, therewould remain the problem of the exchange of populations*
The British Ministers had told the French that,  if the matter was to be dealt with on this basis,  it was necessary to reach some agreement withthe Czechoslovak Government as to what the guiding principle should be.    It had been suggested that the test should be a simple majority of German inhabitants.The next question discussed had been theposition of Czechoslovakia when shorn of the SudetenGerman territories.    In particular,  what would happen tnregard to the other Minorities?   The conclusion reached wasthat the Sudeten German problem must be dealt withas an urgent case on its own particular merits, andnot on the basis of some general principle.    Boththe British and French representatives hoped that theother Minority questions, which did not present difficulties of the same order, might be settled byfriendly negotiations.M. Daladier had said that it was verypresent in his mind (as indeed it was present inthe minds of some members of the Cabinet) that herr Hitler&apos;s real aim was fche domination of central and South-Eastern Europe, and that, for this purpose,he was anxious to secure the total dismemberment of czechoslovakia.    On that assumption something morewas required than the assurance of Herr Hitler thathe would be satisfied if he secured the incorporation in the Reich of the Sudeten Germans.    The FrenchGovernment, therefore,  invited the British Governmentto give a guarantee to Czechoslovakia-
The Prime Minister said that he had told the french ministers that, while we would not exclude considerationof the proposed guarantee, it involved a very seriousadditional liability for this country.     He had also pointed out how difficult it would be for us to fulfil the guarantee if Czechoslovakia was invaded.     We shouldalso have to consider very carefully exactly what wasto be guaranteed.To this M. Daladier had said that any prospect of getting the Czechoslovak Government to agree to asettlement on the lines proposed turned on obtaining adefinite guarantee from this country.     It would be useless to offer to consider the proposition.     Further,the French Government were not prepared to urge uponthe Czech Government their acceptance of the proposals under discussion unless that Government were given somesecurity.In this connection the Prime Minister explainedthat, earlier in the discussion, it had been suggestedthat Czechoslovakia^ existing treaties with France and russia should be replaced by an arrangement which, ineffect, was tantamount to the neutralisation of czechoslovakia;    that is to say, that various countries would guarantee Czechoslovakia against unprovoked aggression, but that Czechoslovakia herself would notbe entitled to enter into treaties which called upon her to go to war in the defence of other countries.v   TheFrench took the view that the neutralisation of czechoslovakia would diminish French security.     If,on the other hand, the British Government were to givea guarantee to the Czechoslovak State, they would therebyassist in forming a bloc between Germany and Eastern
Europe, which would secure that part of Europe against further expansion by Germany.     The French representatives had, therefore, pressed for a definite undertaking bythe British Government to give a guarantee.The British Ministers had asked for time to considerthe matter, and the meeting had adjourned.The Prime Minister said that he and his threecolleagues had felt that they were bound to take responsibility for an immediate decision in regard to theguarantee.     It was of the utmost importance to reach agreement at once with France.     Until that had been doneno steps could be taken to get the agreement of the czechoslovak Government, and before that agreement  had beenobtained it was useless for him (the Prime Minister) toreturn to Herr Hitler.     He and his colleagues had beensustained by the fact that at Saturday&apos;s Meeting of theCabinet none of the Ministers who had referred to thismatter had spoken against it except the Foreign Secretary,who had nevertheless reached the conclusion that only by giving a guarantee could a solution be found to thepresent difficulty.During the adjournment referred to the British ministers had proceeded to draft provisional conclusions in theform of a joint message to be sent to President Benes bythe French and British Governments.     When they had been reasonably satisfied with the document they had given itto the French representatives.     There had then been an adjournment for dinner and the French representatives had been asked; to   return at 9.30 p,m.The French Minister had returned about 10.15 p.nuThey had put forward a number of amendments nearly all of which were concerned with the form and not the substance,of the British draft, mainly with a view to its effect on french public opinion.     in the end the draft had. beenaccepted without much difficulty.-7-
^Copies of the agreed text were then handed to ministers.     This document is attached to these conclusions as an Appendix. /A discussion had then ensued whether the messagecould he despatched immediately to President Benes.But the French Ministers had taken the view that theymust return to France ar.:l discuss  &apos;he matter in theCouncil of Ministers.     It had been arranged that atelegram containing the text of the joint, message shouldmeanwhile be despatched to the British and French ministers in Prague, who would thus be in a position to act on receipt of a telephone message.     The Frenoh Governmenthad promised a reply in the course of the morning.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathe had little to add to the Prime Minister*s account.M. Daladier had said that he was very doubtful of theattitude of two or three members of his Government t*the line of action proposed, from which he seemed fairlycertain that the French Government would accept thesituation.He felt considerable misgivings about the guarantee,but he came down in favour of it for the following reasons:    first, because of the definition which hadbeen given to it:    secondly, because it had been madecontingent on the neutralisation of Czechoslovak foreignpolicy.     He was also influenced by the fact that itwould have been disastrous if there had been any delay in reaching agreement with the French.
Iscussion in regarding proposedllarantee.BJfHTHE PRIME MINISTER then replied to a number of questions raised by Ministers in regard to the termsof the draft message.      It had not been assumed thatGermany would be one of the guarantor countj*iespalthough the French had had this in mind.      It wassuggested that the guarantee should be joint- and several, but the point had not yet been determined.The significance of the phrase in paragraph 6 &quot;Oneof the principal conditions ...,&quot; was the desire toleave the matter vague, so that it would be open tous to introduce other conditions which might befound   desirable on further reflection,      It would,of course, be for us to determine what constituted&quot;unprovoked aggression&quot;,THE LORD CHANCELLOR asked whether the guaranteecovered territories inhabited by the otherminorities,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat such territories were covered, but he pointedout that our guarantee only related to unprovoked aggression.      It did not exclude a peaceful solutionof any minority question.      He also informed theLord Chancellor that the Poles had already raised the question of the Polish minority in Czechoslovakia,This certainly presented a real difficulty, but hecould not feel that it was so serious a difficulty that it ought to stand in the way of a solution ofthe far more serious problem of the Sudeten Germans,
THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he would like,if possible, to add at the end of paragraph 6 wordsto the effect that the guarantee did not bind any ofthe guarantor Powers to insist on the integrity of czechoslovakia in so far as certain minoritydistricts were concerned.THE HOME SECRETARY said that if this attitude had been adopted on Sunday,  it would have been impossible to reach agreement with the French,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, although he had not yet   taken advice onthe matter, he thought that difficulties might arise on the question whether the guarantee should bejoint or several.     If, for example, it was decidedto have a joint guarantee, and Germany, being one ofthe guarantor countries, committed an act of aggression, would the other guarantor countries beexcused from coming to Czechoslovakia&apos;s help?     If,however, tho guarantee was several, and othercountries failed to fulfil their obligations, thiscountry might find itself alone in supportingCzechoslovakia.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE AND THECHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER thought thatit was of the utmost importance to avoid any tiling inin the nature of the latter contingency.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR thought that-the question whetherthe guarantee was to he   joint or several was of theutmost importance.      If it was to he several, there was a danger that we might he left alone to carry out an obligation beyond our powers.     The nature of a -joint guarantee would require close definition.     He pointedout, however, that a joint guarantee would not failbecause of an act of aggression carried out by a country which was itself one of the guarantors.     He thought thatthe right course was a joint guarantee, with an arrangementthat in the event of attack the joint guarantors should meet and decide whether the attack constituted anunprovoked aggression.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS thought that,in the event, the guarantee would be signed by two or three great Powers.     He doubted whether Czechoslovakia would accept the guarantee if a number of lesser Powers were brought in.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thathe was clear that the guarantee was essential in order toreach a settlement.     He also attached importance to theguarantee from the point of view of public opinion.    many people in this country would be deeply disappointed at theidea of a cession of territories and would seek tprepresent it as a complete capitulation.     The guaranteecould be set against this, as it showed a determination onour part to resist further aggression.He thought that normally a guarantee of this kind should not be undertaken, even on behalf of the United .Kingdom alone, -without prior consultation with theDominions.     In the circumstances the action taken had beeninevitable.     It would be necessary to inform the dominions of the position, and he thought that they would raise noobjection to the assumption of this guarantee by theUnited Kingdom.
THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said thathe had not expressed his opinion on the proposed guarantee on Saturday, in view of the Foreign Secretary&apos;ademurrer and the Prime Minister&apos;s own summing up on thisquestion.      He regretted that this step had been forcedon us.     He thought tha* the guarantee would beimpossible to carry out, and might make a wedge between us and the Dominions, who would not accept such an obligation.     Again, such a guarantee put us in theposition that we might become involved in war ortroubles deliberately stirred up on the Continent byGermany or Russia.     At the same time he recognisedthat the Prime Minister and his colleagues had been in amost difficult position and that a guarantee was essential to a solution of the present difficulty.The Lord President concluded that he was prepared to accept his share of the responsibility for it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR viewed theproposed guarantee with some apprehension.     He thoughtthat Czechoslovakia, after the transfer of the SudetenGerman areas, would be economically an unstable State.It was difficult to see how it could survive.     Further,the position of the country would be strategicallyunsound, and there was no means by which we couldimplement the guarantee.     How, for example, could wefight the Poles or the Hungarians if they committed an act of aggression against Czechoslovakia?     He was afraid that the solution proposed was not really a solution, buta postponement of the evil day, and that there was a risk that we were putting cur signature to something whichmight involve, us in dishonoursTHE PRIME MINISTER said that it was not rightto assume that the guarantee committed us to maintaining the existing boundaries of Czechoslovakia.     The- 12 -
1 9  guarantee merely related to unprovoked aggression.He appreciated the difficulty of seeing how we shouldimplement the guarantee.     Its main value would lie inits deterrent effect.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he appreciated the force of what the Secretary of State forWar had said, hut he hoped that we should not go hackupon the agreement reached with the French ministers the previous day.     While there was much in the guaranteewhich he disliked, he thought that it was an essential feature of the only scheme which offered a peaceful solution.     One unpleasant feature of the position wasthat a large number of Germans would be left in czechoslovakia, and it would always be possible for herr hitler to stir up trouble if he so desired.     Nevertheless,,the prospect of war was so appalling that he agreed thatpostponement of the evil day was the right course,THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that he had little doubt that the Chiefs of staff would support the point of view put forward by theSecretary of State for War,     But it was not fair toassume that if Czechoslovakia was the victim of .unprovoked aggression, such aggression would be carriedout by a single country whose territories were outof our reach.     It was at least as reasonable to suppose that such aggression would be carried put aspart of a more general war, in which it would bepossible for us to take some effective action.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed outthat if effect was given to paragraph 6 of the jointmessage, the position of the present Czecho-Sovietobligations would be of historic interest only.     the essence of the proposal in this paragraph was to offer to Czechoslovakia a wholly different position to thatwhich she now occupied.     She would be a buttressedState like Belgium, not able to enter into obligations towards other countries.Some discussion ensued as to the Soviet-CzechTreaty and it was pointed out that the French ministers had referred to this as a definite Treaty and not, as lord Runciman had understood from M. Benes, merely an understanding.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND asked ifhe was right in assuming that the decision to proposed a direct transfer of territory rather than a plebiscitewas based on the view expressed by the French Delegationthat the Czechs would find the former less difficult toaccept.      From the point of view of presentation to thepublic he felt that direct transfer was more difficultto defend than a plebiscite.     He thought that theposition would be eased if emphasis were laid on theright of individuals to ask for exchange to and from the transferred territories.^trnnoforrcd Lerri l-mrle s.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER explained that paragraph 2 had been drafted with this point of view.This paragraph pointed out the practical difficultiesof a plebiscite and also put upon M. Benes a considerable measure of the responsibility for preferring a transfer to a plebiscite.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL referred tothe words in paragraph 3 which laid down as the guiding principle the transfer of territories with over 50 percent, of German inhabitants.     He pointed out that not all German inhabitants would be anxious to be transferredto the Reich, and he suggested the substitution of50 per cent, of the inhabitants belonging to the SudetenGerman party.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought that thissuggestion would be difficult to apply in practice.As regards the constitution of theproposed international body, the Prime Minister, inreply to a question by the Secretary of State forAir, said that this matter had not been discussed,except informally at the official lunch, when hehad suggested to M. Daladier that it should compriserepresentatives of this country, Prance, Germany,Italy and Czechoslovakia, with perhaps LordRunciman as an Impartial chairman.     He had informedM. Daladier that he thought it would probably be undesirable to increase the membership by theinclusion of representatives of a number of other powers.THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT asked whether any estimate had been made of the value of non-Sudeten property in the areas to be transferred.What would happen as regards the property of citizens who wished to leave the transferred areasbefore the transfer took place?THE PRIME MINISTER said that this matter had not been discussed in the negotiations with theFrench, although it had been discussed by theBritish Ministers and their advisers among,themselves.     He thought that consideration should
be given to the position of people who wished to move from one area to another, but were unable to do sounless arrangements were made to facilitate the saleof their property.     He.:also mentioned the difficultiesof men who wished to transfer from one area to anotherbut who, by so doing, would lose their means ofemployment.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH referred to the caseof the Hungarian optants which had been discussed so often at Geneva.     He also asked whether the french had raised any objection to the provision in paragraph 3which stated that areas with over 50 per cent, ofGerman inhabitants should in general be transferred.THE PRIME MINISTER said that no obection had been raised.     This provision was, in effect, basedon what Herr Hitler had told him and he felt that,unless he was in a position to make a settlement on this basis, he might be in an awkward position when he&apos; metHerr Hitler.     It was of the utmost importance not to giveM. Benes any ground for saying later that he would never have accepted this joint proposal if he had known how muohhe might have to concede.     The Prime Minister hopedthat, in the event, he would be able to secure morefavourable terms by negotiation.     He added, in replyto questions, that he had discussed with Herr Hitlertwo alternative methods of dealing with Minorities,either transfer or suitable safeguards.     This, however,was a matter which could not be settled without further examination and would have to be referred to theInternational commissioner
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thathe shared the dislike of many of his colleagues inregard to the proposed guarantee..     Nevertheless, he felt that there was no alternative to the course proposed, and he would accept his share of responsibilityfor defending it.     /He thought that, as a result of the conversationsthat had taken place with, the French on Sunday, theCabinet were now called upon to reach a decision ofa far more definite character as to the lines of thesettlement proposed, than had been the case atSaturday&apos;s Meeting.     The specific lines of a solutionwere now proposed.     He paid a tribute to the manner inwhich the Prime Minister had conducted these difficult negotiations, but he would like to set out fourconditions which he thought were essential to theforthcoming negotiations.The first concerned the provision that areas with over 50^ of German inhabitants would probably have tobe transferred.     He thought that this percentage was appropriate for a plebiscite, but wrong for a transfer.It should be assumed that a certain proportion ofGerman inhabitants did not want to return to the Reich,and a higher percentage than SQ% was therefore justified.The second concerned the proper arrangements forthe transferred individuals.     Germany should be preparedto take her part in these arrangements and In providingany necessary compensation.
The third was that if the present proposals were accepted, and a Border Commission was set up, theGerman Army should he demobilised.The fourth was that Herr Henlein&apos;s Freikorpsshould be disbanded.He regarded the first condition as desirable butnot essential, but each of the others as a sine qua nonof a reasonable settlement.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that hewould like to add his impression of the negotiations onthe preceding day.     The French Ministers on arrival hadbeen somewhat woebegone, but they had gone away withheart and courage restored to them by the Prime Minister.At the same time, any lingering fear that he might havehad, that the attitude of this country might have operated to prevent the French Government from fulfillingtheir obligations had been entirely dispelled bySunday&apos;s Mee t ing,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said itwas a matter of great satisfaction that there had been no disagreement in the Cabinet in regard to the actionto be taken during the present crisis.     There was perhaps a certain difference in the views held as toGermany1 s ultimate aims, but he hoped that any suchdifference would be bridged in the coming months.THE FIRST LORD OF THE.ADMIRALTY thought thedifference was one of emphasis only.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR SCOTLAND asked whatwas the significance of the second sentence of thePress Coramunique, . which read as follows:-&quot;The two Governments hope that thereafter itwill he possible to consider a more general settlement in the interests of European peace.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER explained that the french ministers had desired to insert a paragraph in thejoint message to the effect that Great Britain andFrance had examined various means of providing economichelp to Czechoslovakia,     He had not &quot;been prepared toagree to this paragraph, for two reasons:   first, thatno such examination had taken place;   and, second, thatit would afford the Czechoslovak Government an excuse for delay, since they might make awkward enquiries asto what these plans were.     The French Government had then asked for the insertion of some general phrase inthe Communique,     The sentence quoted above, which wasinnocuous, had been agreed to in order to meet theFrench views.The Prime Minister then announced that news hadbeen received that the French Government had approved the joint message, and that the necessary instructions had been sent to the British and French Ministers atPrague to deliver it to M. Benes.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that he had sent a message to Herr Hitler to the effect that he hoped to resume the conversations on Wednesday.     Hewould not make this a definite engagement until he -knew what reply was received from the czechoslovak government.
In regard to what the President of the Board ofTrade had said he undertook to hear his remarks inmind.     But he was clear that it was no use returning to Herr Hitler with the intention of imposingconditions.     Nothing wpuld he achieved by that procedure.     The right plan was that he should say to Herr Hitler that he had proposals to put to himwhich the latter would regard as meeting hi? claims.If Herr Hitler assented, the Prime Minister wouldthen say to Herr Hitler that he in turn should docertain things on his side.      If things went ashe hoped, he trusted that he would be able to obtainsatisfactory terms on such matters as, for example,demobilisation of the German Army and Herr Henlein&apos;sPreikorps.     He might even be able to get Herr Hitlerto repeat his declaration that if he obtainedincorporation of the Sudeten Germans in the Reichhe would be satisfied.A discussion then ensued about publicity.     Itwas explained that the need for secrecy had been impressed upon the French.     Consideration was givento the question whether it was desirable that thePress should now be informed that certain jointproposals had now been submitted by the British andFrench Governments to M. Benes;    but it was decidedthat, for the present at any rate, this should notbe done.
THE SECRETARY CP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs pointed out that,the present stage represented amost critical period in the negotiations.     Everythingnow depended upon how the French and British proposals were received in Czechoslovakia.     M. Masaryk had told him that morning that he thought the czechoslovak government would fight rather than agree to a largesurrender of territory.     He was not sure, however,whether this answer took into account the proposalto give a guarantee.     There was also the danger that the Czechoslovak Army might assume control.If this happened, Herr Hitler would regard it asa catastrophic event and would order his troops to march.In this connection, some discussion took place as to what action the French would take if M. Benesdid not take the advice tendered to him hy theBritish and French Governments and had resort toarms.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that M. daladier had said that he regarded such a reply as impossible.He read to the Cahinet an extract from the note of the meeting which had taken place the precedingday.THE HOME SECRETARY added that he thought itwas important that the Cabinet should know thatthe British Ministers had done as little as possiblein the way of pressing their views on the FrenchGovernment at the negotiations on the precedingday.

APPENDIX.ENGLISH TEXT OF JOINT MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BENES.from the; BRITISH AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS. AS AGREED IN THEANGLO-FRENCH CONVERSATIONS HELD ON SUNDAY.  18THSEPTEMBER,   I9B8.1.        The representatives of the French and British governments have been in Consultation today on the general situation, and have considered the British Prime Minister&apos;s report of his conversationwith Herr Hitler.     British Ministers also placed before theirFrench colleagues their conclusions derived from- the accountfurnished to them of the work of his Mission by Lord Runciman.We are both convinced that, after recent events the point hasnow been reached where the further maintenance within the boundaries of the Czechoslovak State of the districts mainly inhabited bySudeten-Deutsch cannot in fact continue any longer withoutimperilling the interests of Czechoslovakia herself and of European peace.     In the light of these considerations both governments have been compelled to the conclusion that the maintenance ofpeace and the safety of Czechoslovakia^ vital interests cannoteffectively be assured &quot;unless these areas are now transferred tothe Reich.2. This could be done either by direct transfer or as theresult of a plebiscite.     We realise the difficulties involved ina plebiscite, and we are aware of your objections already expressed to this course, particularly the possibility of far-reachingrepercussions if the matter were treated on the basis of so wide a principle.     For this reason we anticipate in the absence ofindication to the contrary that you may prefer to deal with the
Sudeten-Deutsch problem by the method of direct transfer, andas a case by itself.3* The areas for transfer would probably have toinclude areas with over 50 per cent of German inhabitants, butwe should hope to arrange by negotiations provisions for adjustment of frontiers, where circumstances render itnecessary, by some international body including a Czechrepresentative.    We are satisfied that the transfer of smaller areas based on a higher percentage would not meetthe case.4. The international body referred to might also becharged with questions of possible exchange of population on the basis of right to opt within some specified time limit.5. 7/e recognise that if the Czechoslovak Government isprepared to concur in the measures proposed, involvingmaterial changes in the conditions of the State, they areentitled to ask for some assurance of their   futuresecurity.6. Accordingly His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom would be prepared,as a contribution to thepacification of Europe, to join in an internationalguarantee of the new boundaries of the CzechoslovakState against unprovoked aggression.    One of theprincipal conditions of such a guarantee would be the safeguarding of the independence of Czechoslovakia by thesubstitution of&quot;a general guarantee against unprovoked aggression in place of existing treaties which involvereciprocal obligations of a military character.
7. Both the French and British Governments re^gnxz.e--^ij0Jfgreat is the sacrifice thus required of the czechoslovak government in the cause of peace.    But because that causeis c common both to Europe in general and in particular to czechoslovakia herself they have felt it their duty jointlyto set forth frankly the conditions essential to secure it.8. The Prime Minister must resume conversation wi thHerr Hitler not later than Wednesday, and earlier ifpossible.    Ve therefore feel we must ask, for -your-., re ply. .at^.,,earliest possible moment.
