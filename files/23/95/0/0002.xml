international situation.Central Europe.^Czechoslovakia.(previous reference:Cabinet 37 (38).).In pursuance of Conclusion (3) of theMeeting mentioned in the margin,  the Cabinetresumed their discussion of the international situation in relation to Central Europe andCzechoslovakiaPTHE PRIME MINISTER said that, at the previous meeting of the Cabinet on September 12th,  theirthoughts had been directed, principally to the speech to be made that evening by Herr Hitler.      As theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had explained,their endeavours had been directed to taking suchaction as would make Herr Hitler realise that if France was involved in war,  it was likely that weshould also be involved while not driving him to precipitate action by any repetition of May 21st.-1 The...Prime Minister said that he had not himselfthought that Herr Hitler&apos;s speech would, take us much further,.On Monday night,  the reports of the speech were received and examined.      The preliminary impressionsof the speech, later confirmed by closer examination,showed that the.action we had taken had been justified, inasmuch as Herr Hitler had not doneanything irrevocable. -     At the same time, .the speechgave no encouragement, and. contained some ominousphrases.      In particular, although he did not commit himself to a plebiscite, he used words which pointedin that directions      The practical difficulties ofa plebiscite were enormous, ,but if the demand tookthat form,  it would be difficult for the democraticcountries to go. to war in order to prevent the
Sudeten Germans from saying what form of government they wanted to have.The Prime Minister said that much time had been spent in the last few days in discussing the plebiscite question.     An incident in the SudetenGerman areas might, at any time, arise and provoke a crisis.       He had already told his colleagues thatthere might come a time when we found ourselves onthe very edge of some vital and irrevocable actionon the part of Germany, as, for example,  that germany was on the point of marching into Czechoslovakia,having decided, notwithstanding the warnings we had given, to take her chance.     .      He had given somethought before the Meeting of Ministers held on the30th August to a plan which had occurred to him as one which might be put into force at a moment&apos;notice, and which would have some chance at theeleventh hour of preserving peace.The Prime Minister said that he had discussed this plan with one or two colleagues in closest touch with him at the time, and he had also mentioned it to Sir Nevile Henderson.      The latter had taken the view that, if Herr Hitler had decidedto invade Czechoslovakia, this new idea might causehim to cancel that intention.     The vital element in this plan was surprise, and as it was imperative that no hint of what was in contemplation shouldleak out, ,he had thought it better to postponementioning it until the last moment.
3ribThe plan was that, as soon as it became clearthat a solution could be reached in no other way,the Prime Minister himself should go to Germany and see Herr Hitler.      As originally sketched, theprocedure proposed was that the Prime Minister shouldnot let Herr Hitler know that he was coming to Germanyuntil he had actually started.      This procedure,however, which was intended to prevent Herr Hitlerfrom saying that he could not see the Prime Minister,would expose the latter to a rebuff.      Herr Hitlermight say that he had a cold and could not see thePrime Minister,,      This would be humiliating, and,moreover, would result in a serious situation.bir Nevile Henderson had thought that this procedure was too risky, and had preferred that herr Hitler should be informed of the Prime Minister&apos;proposed visit, and his assent obtained^in advance.It was considered that if this procedure was adoptedit would be less likely to result in a refusal, andthat the first suggestion   might lead Herr Hitlerto think that his hand was being forced.The success of the plan depended upon its beingaccurately timed.      If adopted too soon it would beasked why this action had been taken before LordRunciman had finished his task.    On the other hand,if we waited too long, Herr Hitler might have takensome irrevocable action.Up to yesterday afternoon (15th September), thePrime Minister continued, he had had it in mind thatthis plan, which had been known as plan &quot;Z&quot;, should
be put into effect probably towards the end of thepresent week,      un the preceding afternoon, however,events had started to move rapidly and there hadbeen a succession of &quot;incidents&quot; in the Sudeten areas.&apos;A remarkable communication had also beenreceived yesterday afternoon (13th September) fromSir Eric Phipps, who had seen M. Bonnet.      The latter had been described.as In a state of collapse.     Heseemed thoroughly cowed, and convinced that if warcame the great cities of Prance and England wouldbe laid in ruins.      It appeared that the french had been very frightened by a report from ColonelLindbergh saying that Germany had 8,000 aeroplanesand could produce 1,500 a month.Later in the day M. Daladier had wanted to speak to the Prime Minister on the telephone.      this might have been embarrassing, and Sir Eric Phippswas asked to see him.      Sir Eric replied that he hadalready seen M,, Daladier, but would, if necessary,do so again.      In the report of his first conversationwith the French Prime Minister, Sir Eric Phippssaid that he had found M,. Daladier a very differentperson from what he had been on the 8th September.At the present time he was not committing himself to anything but that some way must be found out.At the second, interview M, Oaladier had said thatat all costs Germany must be prevented from invadingCzechoslovakia because in that case France would be faced with her obligations.     The Prime minister thought that this language ,;was significant.
Later in the evening news had arrived of the ultimatum delivered by the Sudeten Germans to the czechoslovak Government.      The latter had refusedit, but had left the door open for negotiation.Herr Henlein had now notified the czechoslovak government that negotiations had been broken off.In these circumstances the Prime Minister saidthat he and the Foreign Secretary, with the advice of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the HomeSecretary *- themselves two former foreign secretaries - had decided that plan &quot;Z&quot; should beput into operation at once.     A telegram had accordingly been despatched to Sir Nevile Henderson.(Copies of this telegram, No. 368 to Paris, were handed round at the Meeting).The Prime Minister said that his hand had been forced, since a position had been reached in which,unless plan &quot;Z1f was put into effect quickly, itcould not be adopted at all.     He hoped that theCabinet would feel that he had not gone beyond hisproper duty In taking this action on the advice ofthose of his colleagues whom he had mentioned, but without consulting the full Cabinet.,The Prime Minister thought that the cabinet should be aware of two suggestions which had beenmade by M. Daladier.     The first was that lord Runciman should now produce a plan.     We wereby no means sure that Lord Runciman was ready toproduce a plan, and we did not want to press him to
do so.      Even if the production of a plan now wasfeasible, this course was open to variousobjections.      Thus, it might not be acceptable tothe two parties, and it would be liable to be described as &quot;the British plan&quot;.      We did not want the responsibility of sponsoring any particularscheme.Mo Daladier&apos;s second suggestion was that aThree-Power Conference should be summoned to discusssuch a plan0      Our view was that there was no hopeof getting Germany to accept a Three-Power Conference,although she might conceivably accept a Pour^power conference,      Even the latter, however, was open to several objections. It was a clumsyinstrument.      Russia, Poland, and possibly other   -countries would want to be admitted to it.      Germany .preferred bilateral to multilateral arrangements.Finally, there was nothing in a Four-Power conference which was likely to prove attractive to Germany.It was felt that plan &quot;Z&quot; had a much better chanceof acceptance.The Prime Minister said that he would.like togive the Cabinet some idea of the lines on which hewould propose to talk to Herr Hitler if the latteragreed to receive him.      He hoped that the idea wouldappeal to the Hitlerian mentality.      Herr Hitlerliked to see Heads of States, and it might beagreeable to his vanity that the British Prime&apos;Minister should take so unprecedented a step.;
But he also had in mind that you oould say more to aman face to face than you could put in a letter, andhe thought that doubts as to the British attitude would be better removed by discussion than by any-other means.The Prime Minister said that he thought thatthe right course was to open by ah appeal to herr Hitler on the grounds that he had a great chanceof obtaining fame for himself by making peace inEurope and thereafter by establishing good relationswith this country, which was always his aim.After some such opening it might be pointed outthat if Germany was to have the goodwill of theBritish people, it was essential that the present dispute should not be settled by force. &apos;  We wereneither pro-Czech nor pro-Sudeten German.      Ourbusiness was to keep the peace and find a just and equitable settlement.      Negotiations had continued fora long time.     Thanks, however, to pressure fromourselves and Prance, M. Benes had gone much further than had been expected.   At this point there wouldprobably be a tirade against M. Benes and a statement that it was impossible to have any confidence thatM. Benes   would carry out his promises.The Prime Minister said that he thought that atthis point reference might be made to the suggestionthat some international body should be set up to supervise the fulfilment of any agreement reached.To this Herr Hitler might retort that no agreement had yet been reached and that matters could not go on
indefinitely 0    The Prime Minister had. had in mind to propose as a solution that the two parties should agree to put their views before Lord. Runciman and toaccept Lord Runciman as the final arbitrator.The Prime Minister said he would., of course,have to make it elea.r that he could not answer forMo Benes.   At the same time he would undertake to putall the pressure he could on M. Benes, and. that theFrench would do likewiseoThis, said the Prime Minister, was the ideawith which he had. started.   But he now felt that herr hitler might say that,, while this might have- beenacceptable a week ago, nothing could, now settle thematter except a. Plebiscite.    The Prime minister thought that- the Cabinet would, have to consider very carefully what should, be said to any such demand.Some people might take the view that the demandfor a Plebiscite should be rejected out of hand.That was not his view, nor the view of the foreign secretary.   He thought it was impossible for a.democracy like ourselves to say that we would go towar to prevent the holding of a Plebiscite.   Further,the presence within their boundaries of a homogeneous,disciplined and easily-moved people such as the sudeten Germans, was not a source of strength to czechoslovakia.   The Prime Minister added that hewas aware of the enormous difficulties attending a plebiscite.    There was the initial difficulty ofdelimiting the areas to which the Plebiscite shouldrelate;    there were mixed populations to be dealtwith;    there were also strategic and economic considerations:    but he doubted whether Czechoslovakiawould ever have peace so long as the Sudeten Germans
were part of the country.   He 5.16. not think it right that we should say that we would have nothing to do with the idea of a Plebiscite.   He would propose, ofcourse, to start the conversation on the lines already indicated, but he thought we must be prepared to bebrought up against the Plebiscite issue.A great deal of consider consideration had been given tothe question^ and he thought the difficulties were not entirely incapable of solution.   He mentioned in garti-cular one suggestion which had originally been putforward, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and whichhad much to commend it.    This was that the Sudeten Germans should at the outset be given a wide measureof autonomy in specified, areas, with the option ofa Plebiscite after a given period.    This would ensurethat the Plebiscite took place in a better atmosphere,and would relate the Plebiscite to specified areas.As regards mixed areas, the only satisfactory solutionseemed to be transfer.But supposing that part of Czechoslovakia weregiven to Germany, what would happen to the rest of thecountry?    It might be said that there would be ahelpless little strip of territory liable at any moment to be gobbled, up by Germany.   The Czechs might take that view and might prefer to die fighting ratherthan accept a solution which would rob them of theirnatural frontiers .-   The Prime Minister said, the only answer whichhe could find was one which he was most unwilling to contemplate, namely, that this  country should, join inguaranteeing the integrity of the rest of Czechoslovakia,
This would be a new liability, and he realised thatwe could not save Czechoslovakia if Germany decidedto over-run it.    The value of the guarantee would lie in its deterrent effect.   The sort of arrangementcontemplated was that Czechoslovakia should be guaranteed by France, Russia, Germany and ourselves,and should be relieved from liability to go to theassistance of the guarantor countries, and would thus become a neutral State.   This would help to clear upthe situation in Central Europe.   He did not suggestthat the Cabinet should be called upon to give any final opinion on such a wide question, but he wouldlike to know that the idea was not altogetherexcluded.The Prime Minister pointed out that theinducement to he held out to Herr Hitler in theproposed negotiations was the chance of securingbetter relations between Germany and England.   Thischance would be lost if Herr Hitler had recourse to force now.   He could say that if a solution was foundto the present difficulty, we might presently be ableto deal with problems which affected both countries.In this  connection the Prime Minister referredto the statement which Field-Marshal Goering had.made to Sir Nevile Henderson to the effect that ifonce the present difficulty was settled, we in thiscountry would be surprised at the moderation of theGerman demands.
The Prime Minister then referred to theencirclement argument and thought that some reference might be made to the economic assistance which we had recently afforded to Turkey.      If it was suggested tohim that we were trying to hem Germany in, he would reply that we had no desire to do that.     We wished to foster international trade and we realised that wecould not have it all.     The position was that othercountries came to us and said that Germany had established a stranglehold over their trade.     Allthese difficulties had arisen from the politicalsituation and if only an understanding could be reached between the two countries, these matters of trade could easily be settled.If the question of Colonies was raised, thePrime Minister would say that this would have to beleft till later.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL asked whatwould happen if other minorities asked for a plebiscite.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not contemplate that any such demand would be made.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that it was true that the other minorities in czechoslovakia were content at the moment.     One ofthe dangers, however, was that the idea of a plebiscitewas infectious and the point must be borne in mind.THE PRIME MINISTER then read a Renter&apos;message which had just been received, in which
^* increased emphasis was laid on the right of the sudeten Germans to self-determination.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY asked what line we should take if Herr Hitler asked whether,if the Czech Government refused to agree to our plan, we should withdraw our support from them.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that he thought the idea of the guarantee would very likely make allthe difference.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that if this question was put, the PrimeMinister might reply that it was impossible to answersuch a question in advance.     It would be necessaryto see first what attitude the Czech Government took.The main point was to get agreement on a broad line,and Great Britain and Germany should remain in close contact in order to ensure that any difficulties which arose were ironed out.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had communicated the plan to Lord Runciman, who had replied that he was in agreement, although he realised that it might he the end of his mission.   He had inmind that he might ask Lord Runciman to come toBerchtesgaden,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies said that one aspect of the Chancellor of theExchequer1s suggestion which might be acceptable tothe Czech Government was that, whereas a plebiscitetoday would certainly result in incorporation of the
Sudeten areas in the Reich, it was by no means certainthat the same would be the result after some years of autonomy,,THE MINISTER OP HEALTH thought that theposition was a little difficult for those ministers who had not been concerned in all the discussions.While in general agreement with what the Prime minister had said, he thought that we were being led by pressure to do something which we should not have doneof our own free will.     There were also certain dangersin projecting these conversations some time ahead.He asked what would happen if the invitation was not accepted, or if an answer was delayed for a long time9THE PRIME MINISTER said that if a favourableanswer was received he proposed to start at once if no answer, or an unfavourable answer, was received, hewould summon the Cabinet,, He would not wait long foran answer.Continuing, THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said thatif   we came to some arrangement whereby Lord Runcimanwas accepted.as arbitrator, we should be in a strong-position.     He thought that specific action to enablethe plebiscite to be carried out should be considered.He cited the Silesian Plebiscite, where responsiblepeople had decided what should be done over the headsof the contending parties, and where the towns had beengarrisoned by troops of neutral parties.     This last point was of considerable importance,
The Minister of Health also asked whatvalue would be attached to a guarantee to Czechoslovakiawhich we might give in present circumstances.    people would say that we had been bluffed on the present occasion.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that, inhis view, the &quot;Z&quot; plan was absolutely right and wouldbe regarded as a real effort to avert a great tragedy.Even if it met with a rebuff, it would be recognisedthat we had done everything possible to avoid acatastrophe. /THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR agreed with theSecretary of State for Air that the plan was anadventurous one which would appeal to the imaginationof the whole world.    It was not without risk, hut therewas some risk about all really big undertakings.    Hewould like to make two suppositions^/   The first, that herr Hitler would be flattered and ready to listen.    Inthis case, he was entitled to ask:    What, if conciliationfailed, we proposed to do.    The second supposition wasthat Herr Hitler might say candidly that he was notinterested about autonomy for the Sudeten Germans andthat he wished to incorporate    thern in the Reich.    if that was his desire, what action did we propose totake?   He thought that it might be made plain to herr Hitler that the world thought that the presentepisode was all part of a relentless plan on the lines -of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.    We had to make up our minds what weshould do in the face of such a situation.    He thoughtthat if we did not obtain satisfaction, we should make
it clear to Herr Hitler that we should follow a holdcourse and should intensify our rearmament programme.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERhoped that this latter point would be borne in mind.The only moral justification for the course proposed was to make it clear to Herr Hitler that,  sooner or later,  if we did not come to terms with him, we shouldhave to add greatly to the strength of our armed forces inorder that later on we might be in a position to resist, by force if necessary, any further acts of aggression,.    the root factor in the present situation was that Britainand France together, were not in a position to fightGermany, as the result of our failure to take adequatesteps to rearim.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA saidthat he proposed to confine his remarks to theproblems of immediate importance.    He said that, forsome time, he had been of the opinion that Herr hitler was determined to incorporate the Sudeten Germans inthe Reich.    The present series of incidents wasengineered.    The real question was whether it was better for the Sudeten Germans to be incorporated in the reich by military violence,  or as the result of theirown choice,  as shown in a plebiscite.    He had nodoubt which was the lesser evil-    He thought that weshould tell Herr Hitler that, subject to suitableconditions, -we should not oppse self-determination.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE saidthat he admired the decision taken as to plan &quot;Z&quot;.    Hethought that it was important that when the plan wasmade public, it should be made clear that it was a
sign of strength and not of weakness-    Thus itshould be shown to be consistent with the statements which had already been made as to the difficulty ofbeing sure that our real views were communicated to herr Hitler.Continuing, the President of the Board ofTrade said that he was in complete agreement with theproposal that Lord Runciman should act as arbitrator.The plebiscite question seemed, however, to him to bea very different matter.    Immediate acceptance of a plebiscite would give Herr Hitler everything which hewas now demanding by force and would be a completesurrender.    In his view, no Government which proposedsuch a suggestion would stand for long.    Nor would itdeserve to.    He thought, however, that to decide onacceptance of a plebiscite and to announce,  at thesame time, the intention to increase the pace of ourrearmament would be a sign of weakness.The Chancellor of the Exchequers suggestioncontained considerable elements of justice.    the plebiscite would then be carried out in a betteratmosphere, and if the Sudeten Germans,  after fiveyears of autonomy, still wanted to leave Czechoslovakia,it would be very difficult to say that they shouldnot do so.
There was a big gulf between a plebisciteon the lines proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer and an immediate plebiscite.     A large sectionof public opinion in Germany was frightened of war,and would act as a brake on Herr Hitler, if they knew that he had refused the offer of autonomy followedby a plebiscite after an interval.In his view the prime Minister&apos;s planpresented the only possibility, but he thought thatwe must be careful that it did not lead us furtheralong the road to complete surrender.     It was important to make it plain that the decision takenwas not only conciliatory but was also a firm step,THE PRIME MINISTER made it clear that hewould, of course, enter into no definite engagementin regard to a plebiscite, but he thought that heshould say that in certain circumstances the idea couldbe discussed.     One alternative was, of course, a plebiscite in about six months&apos; time, after theReservists had been demobilised, and under the auspices of an international commission.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that everyone would feel that the step which had been taken was inspired by courage and vision.     He agreed as to the firststeps which the Prime Minister had proposed, but feltmore difficulty about a plebiscite.     A demand for self-determination was difficult to refuse, but it was difficult to see how a fair plebiscite could be carriedout in present conditions,,
The Chancellor of the Exchequer?s proposal had much to commend it0      It would allow time for theposition to cool down, and Herr Hitler could say thathis demand for a plebiscite had been conceded.   Thiswas important psychologically.     To this might be added theidea of a neutral guaranteed State for the remainder of CzechoslovakiaQ     He thought that, whereas the attack on Austria arose from very deep emotions on thepart of Herr Hitler, in the case of the Sudeten Germanshe was mainly concerned with foreign policy.     If hisfear could be removed, matters should be easier.If, however, Herr Hitler was not preparedto meet us on these lines, he hoped we would not give in.     If we did, this country would cease to be worthy of respect.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESwarmly approved of the proposals     The only point whichhe criticised was the absence of any suggestion for aguarantee of safe-conduct for the Prime Minister.     Asthe exordium to the proposed conversations, he suggestedthat the Prime Minister might say that he was impressed with the growing feeling in this country that war withGermany was inevitable, either now or in the nearfuture.     This suspicion arose from the idea that a conflict with the German peoples was inevitable, butthat he.himself did not believe in these inevitabletrends    if    matters were dealt with on the right linesat the right momenta     The Minister said that publicopinion had greatly changed in the last few years, andthe people who had then been loudest in opposing re-armament were now loudest&apos;in demanding that this country should take a firm line.
He thought it would be important not to letHerr Hitler know that the French had agreed to adopt anyplan which was acceptable to us0With regard to a plebiscite, he thought therewas all the differencd in the world between a plebiscitenow and one a little later.     The latter was, in his view,the proper course0     The danger was that Herr hitler would see that, whereas a plebiscite now would be likelyto go&apos;in his favour, one later on might have a very different result0THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL whole-heartedly approved the plan.     He agreed with theproposal that Lord Runciman should act as arbitrator, buthe would like to reserve his views about the plebisciteproposal, and he hoped that the Prime Minister would nothave to commit himself, or the country, on this point.In this connection he was somewhat apprehensive of theposition in regard to other minorities, and of theproposed guarantee.     In connection with the latter pointhe recalled the advice given by the Chiefs of Staff.He was also doubtful if the Czech Government would accepta plebiscite.     He suggested that, if the plebisciteproposal was put forward, the Prime Minister should try to play for time, so as to give opportunities for further discussion with his colleagues and with the French andCzechoslovak Governments.    He asked whether there would bean Interpreter present.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was contemplated that both Sir Nevile Henderson and Herr Schmidt would attend the meeting,THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION thoughtthat there might be a demand for protection for the Sudeten Germans in order to stop the present unfortunate incidents.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had this point inmind, and referred to what had been done in the Saai*e
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the plebiscite issue would certainly be raised.     He thoughtthat, while the temper of the country was rising, themajority of people would take the view -chat a plebiscitecarried out under reasonable conditions was preferable towar.     He suggested that one of these conditions should bethat the plebiscite should be carried out after an interval of some months and be under international control.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he thought very well of this magnificent proposal, which would have agreat influence over the whole world.     The plan wasunexampled and had a great chance of success,,The first question which would arise was what course France would take6     If France did not go to war inorder to -protect Czechoslovakia it was clear that we couldnot be expected to do so;    and at the moment France had&quot;cold feet&quot;0     He thought that the Government should paygreat attention to what they had been told by the secretaries of State for War and Air as to the position ofour defence preparations,,     If war came it would be  a life and death matter alike to Herr Hitler and to ourselves.The time factor was of the utmost importance.     He hoped thatthe interview with Herr Hitler would result in giving us abreathing-space of some weeks, or perhaps months^THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then read out two recent telegrams from Prague, Noso 569 and572.     The second of these telegrams gave particulars offorar demands made toy the Sudeten Germans which had not beenaccepted by the Czechoslovak. Government.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat he fully approved the plan proposed, which hethought would he universally welcomed.     He mentioned thatMr. te Water,: the High Commissioner for the Union ofSouth Africa, had said to him: -e^-^fee^^nT^^that all now rested in our hands:    this country alonecould influence and restrain Germany, and we had theone man who could do it, namely, the Prime Minister.He himself agreed with the line which it was proposedto adopt in the conversations, namely, starting with tfcemost- favourable, and proceeding to the less favourablecourse.     He felt that the proposal that Lord Runcimanshould act as arbitrator, while it might have beenaccepted at one time, was now too late. .    It was most,important that we should not be too late again.     Hethought that a proposal on the lines of the Chancellorof the Exchequers suggestion would be a very wisecompromise BIf need be, however, he (the Secretary ofState) would accept a plebiscite in six months&apos; time.And, if it was impossible to obtain that amount ofrespite, humiliating though   the position might be, hewould prefer an immediate plebiscite to war.He was not altogether in agreement with thePresident of the Board of Trade about publicopinion in this country.     He did not think that publicopinion wanted war in order to avoid a plebiscite,   ^-^ere was still an immense pacifist element in the LabourParty.

Dominions, /-$he Acting High Commissioner in Australiaalmost any course to war.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that  inhis view the choice was not between war and a plebiscite, but between war now and war later.He had never been optimistic about our catching upGermany in our re-armament programme.Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster that ouractions to-day were influenced by fear of Germanarms.    He was quite confident that if we went towar we should win.    What was really influencingus was hatred of war0propose the mobilisation of the Fleet.    This,however, was now but of the question, and he muchpreferred plan &quot;Z&quot;.    The plan had, however, two possible dangers.    The first was that if we put up a proposal which Germany accepted but Czechoslovakiarefused, we should then make it much more difficult for ourselves to support the latter country.    In thisway we might improve the German case.The second was that we might be accused ofacting behind the backs of France.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that he had never viewed this war as an adventureto save Czechoslovakia, but as something which might be forced on us in order to save France.    It was clearthat we could not prevent Czechoslovakia from being over-run;    nor,  if it,was once over-run, would ithad^aeiA that opinion in that country would preferNor did he agree with the suggestion of theThe First Lord added that he had intended to
ever be likely to be re-created in its existing form.In regard to the line which the discussion would take, he thought it was possible that Herr Hitlermight begin by suggesting that Germany was beinghemmed in and that  we were out to prevent her fromdominating certain parts of the world in the same way that we dominated other parts of the world.    For his part, he thought the reply to such an opening might bethat we were prepared to see Germany a great people,with a rising population,  and a tremendous force in theworld.    Nor did we propose to deny Germany a dominatingposition in South Eastern Europe if this could beobtained by proper methods.    What we objected to was theuse of threats and force.The Minister also said that he thought itwas important to make it clear that the present approach was not being made out of weakness.    He thought that thereal importance of the proposed meeting would be the renewal of general contacts with Germany.As regards a plebiscite, he thought itwould be folly to deny the rights of self-determination and to fight a war to prevent it.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, -said thathe felt sure the Prime Minister iauest feel deeply moved by the way in which his colleagues had received thisbrilliant proposal0       It had, of course, always been intended to unfold the proposal to the Cabinet before it had been adopted, but things had moved too quickly-.
He thought that the proposal would he recognised allthe world over, not merely as a positive contribution,but as almost the only way of impressing the Germanpeople.    Their Press was controlled and facts wereconcealed from them, but this was something whichcould not be kept dark.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that to concede a well ordered plebiscite would not give Hitlerall he asked for.    The policy of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;represented a great deal more.    He also doubted whether the proposal that Lord Runciman should actas arbitrator and the proposal for a plebiscite couldbe regarded as necessarily separate proposals.    before an arbitrator could be appointed., his powers would haveto be determined,  and he thought that Mo  Benes wouldcertainly object if Lord Runciman was appointedarbitrator with powers to award a part ofCzechoslovakian territory to another country.    Ifthis happened,  it would raise the plebiscite issue.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked theCabinet to record their unanimous approval of theaction taken, to express their confidence and trustin the Prime Minister and to authorise him, if the invitation is accepted, to carry on conversations in the light of the discussion at the present meeting,      His absence from this country, if only for a short time, was a grievous matter, but if he came back with the seeds of peace with honour hewould   be universally acclaimed as having carriedout the greatest achievement of the last twenty years.This course was agreed to,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was much touchedby the confidence placed in him by his colleagues.The fate of much might depend upon his efforts, buthe would not have done his duty to his conscience ifhe did not make this effort to avert the threatenedcatastrophe, ^He was grateful to his colleagues for theexpression of their views, and he was clear as to howfar they would wish him to go.     At the same time itwas impossible to lay down precise limitations.     on some points it might be necessary to go ratherfurther than at first intended, while in others itmight not be necessary to concede so much.      Hewould, however, undertake to do his very best, inthe light of the discussiono
The Prime Minister then dealt with variouscontingencies.      If Herr Hitler refused the invitation, he thought that the Cabinet should meet at once to consider the position.      If the invitation was accepted, he thought that it would almost certainly be necessary to summon parliament on his return, but only for a limited period.      Ifthe invitation was refused, a situation might stillarise in which Parliament would have to be summoned.But no decision was called for on this point at thepresent time.Whether the invitation was accepted or refused,it would have to be made public before long.     Forthe time being, however, it was of the utmost importance that the proposal should be keptabsolutely secret.     He asked his colleagues to bearthis in mindoTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat it was of the utmost importance that steps shouldbe taken to ensure that the Press received the news of plan &quot;Z&quot; correctly, and suggested that it might benecessary that the newspaper proprietors and editorsshould be seen instead of the Lobby and DiplomaticCorrespondents.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE also mentioned a suggestion that instead of an interviewit might be better to issue a statement. Possiblyboth courses could be combined.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on this occasion itwould be necessary to issue a statement.It was also suggested that it was important tomake it clear to the Press that we were making thisproposal not from weakness but from strength.
CONCLUSIONS.The Cabinet agreed  (l) To record their whole-hearted approvalof the action taken by the Prime minister in sending a personal message to Hen?Hitler containing an offer by the PrimeMinister to come over to Germany at once to.confer with Herr Hitler.(2) That if the offer is accepted, the PrimeMinister should be authorised to confer with Herr Hitler on the general lines indicated in the discussion at the present meeting.(3) That if the offer is refused, the cabinet should meet at once to consider thepositiono(4) That if the offer is accepted, it wouldhe necessary to summon Parliament to meet ,.on the Prime Minister&apos;s return, for alimited period,,(5) That it was of the utmost importance thatthe action taken should be kept absolutelysecret for the time being.(6) That when the time came to make an announcementa special comraunique should be issued to thePress.(7) That consideration of the mobilisation ofthe Fleets which the First Lord had intendedto propose at the present Meeting,  shouldbe deferred for the time being.(8) To take note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP. 197 (38)) covering a copy of aPrivate and Confidential letter from theBritish Ambassador in Paris, dated 10thSeptember!, 1938* and of his reply theretodespatched on the 12th September, 1938trelating to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the event of a German attack upon Czechoslovakia.

Attendance at Windsor was, ofcourse, a matter which depended upon receiving an invitation from the Palace0      In regard to the memorial Service, the position was that it wasnot proper to he rexoresented at a Royal Funeralor Memorial Service, and that any Minister who wished, to pay his tributes must, therefore, attendhimself.      Attendance at this latter service isa matter to be arranged by Ministers individuallywith the Vicar of St. Martin&apos;s in the Fields,i.e. no Minister is under obligation to attend,or need seek permission to absent himself. - Butit would probably be desirable that a certainnumber,  including, no doubt,  the Defence Ministers,should  attend.Richmond Terrace, S,-W,i.14th September, 1938.
