MB IIWERNAMONALSITUATION,Bie PrimeSinisterfs SecondKelt to herr hitler.ftrevi previous reference:Ipbinet 42 (38)),The Cabinet resumed the discussion which had&quot;been adjourned at 7.30 p.m. on the previous evening,Saturday, the 24th September.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that M. Daladier and M. Bonnet were flyingover to England and would be available for discussion about 5 p.m. that same day.He also reported that Mr. Anthony Eden had informed him that he hoped,  if the terms of herr hitler^s proposals were as stated in the newspaperreports, that we should reject them.In reply to a question, the Foreign secretary said that no news had yet been received from Prague.He had sent a telegram to Prague to the effect thatwe assumed that the Czechoslovak Government*s reply would be submitted to the Prime Minister and notdirect to Herr Hitler.     He had also stated that ifany representative of the Czech Government was ableto spare time to come over and discuss the matter inthis country we should be glad to receive him.THE PRIME MINISTER answered certain questionsfrising out of Herr Hitler*s Memorandum.     Hethought that the object aimed at in the appendix to that Memorandum was to secure that the area to betransferred was handed over as a working concern andwas not first made a deserts     Thus there was aprovision that no goods or cattle might be removed,but this related only to the period up to theoccupation by German troops.     What happenedafterwards was another matter which would be dealt ,with by the proposed German-Czech Commission referredto in paragraph 6,Asked about the guarantee, the Prime ministers aid that the position was that the British Government
had offered to join in an international guarantee ifthe British and French Governments&apos; proposals were accepted,     Those proposals had not been acceptedby Germany in the form in which they were submittedsince the method of transfer was still in dispute.He saw no reason, however, to make any change inthe offer which we had made iD join in an inter-national guarantee.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed outthat part of the plan had been that Germany should sign a pact of non-aggression and that this had not yet been secm^ed.     Further, he askedwhether the Prime Minister was prepared to give aguarantee before the problem of the Polish andHungarian minorities had been settled.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this would benecessary and that the prospect did not alarm him.So great was the mutual mistrust between Czecho-slovakia and Germany that it was essential that the assurances which Herr Hitler had given should be reinforced from the outset by some guarantee.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,said that he thought that it would be desirablethat we- should be clear in our own minds as to theposition of the Polish and Hungarian minoritiesunder the Covenant of the League of Nations before we made any approach to Russia,     He thought that itwould be rather a dangerous course to give a guarantee to Czechoslovakia when matters were in so fluid aposition.     If the Czechoslovak Government ware toaccept Herr Hitler&apos;s offer were we to undertake to goto Czechoslovakia&apos;s assistance if German troops crossed the new frontier? j There was a danger of incidents, andhe felt uneasy about the position.   It was true that the offer of a
guarantee which, we had made was not at the moment legallyoperative.     Nevertheless he felt that a moral obligationrested upon us in consequence of the concessions whichCzechoslovakia, on British and French advice, had agreedto make although effect had not yet been given to these concessions.-THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that on theprevious Sunday, in agreement with the representatives ofthe French Government, the representatives of the BritishGovernment had reached two important decisions:    first,that Czechoslovakia should be asked to give up certainSudeten areas:    secondly, that if she gave up these areas the United Kingdom Government would be prepared to join in an international guarantee of the new boundaries of the czechoslovak State against unprovoked aggression.    (SeeJoint Message to President Benes Cabinet 40(38) Appendix).,Some of the present difficulties arose from the fact thatthese decisions had been framed in somewhat vague terms which had not as yet been closely or clearly defined.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA pointed outthat the Czechoslovak Government, in accepting the jointFrench and. British proposals, had done so on thesupposition that if Czechoslovakia was attacked in themeantime we should come to her assistance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat last Sunday&apos;s decisions had been taken on thesupposition that the transfer of territory would takeplace under the control and supervision of an international commission.     He thought it was difficult to conceivethat the Czechoslovak Government would readily surrenderthese safeguards unless we said quite definitely that if germany ever crossed the new frontier we should at once embark on hostilities.     Even if we wereprepared to give that definite guarantee he thought
it would be a tremendous responsibility to advise the Czechoslovak Government to accept Herr Hitler1sterms..   We should he asking them not merely to give up strong military fortifications, but also to accepta moral defeat.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE thoughtthat the first question was to settle whether weshould advise the Czechoslovak Government to acceptthe present offer, and that if it was decided toadvise the Czechoslovak Government to refuse herr hitler&apos;s proposals a number of the points whichwere under discussion would not arise.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he had found his opinion changing somewhatin the last day or so, and even now he was not toocertain of his view.   Yesterday he had seen, orthought he had seenf certain things fairly clearly.For example, what alternative was open to Czechoslovakiaother than acceptance?   The answer was war, leading tothe almost certain disruption of the country, accompaniedby great loss of life and suffering.A week ago, when the Franco-British proposals had been drawn up, he had felt strongly the immoralityof yielding to force;   hut he, felt that we had to someextent overcome that objection by the plans forcarrying out the transfer which, it was hoped, would besettled by an International Commission.    Yesterday hehad felt that the difference between acceptance of theprinciple of last Sunday1s proposal and the scheme now put forward a week later for its application did not involve a new acceptance of principle.    He was not quite sure, however, that he still held that view.     What
made him hesitate was that it might he held thatthere was a distinction in principle between orderly and disorderly transfer with all that the latter impliedfor the minorities in the transferred areas.Much, of course, turned on Herr Hitlersfuture intentions and on the Anglo-Germanrapprochement of which the Prime Minister had spokenon Saturday.   Nevertheless, he could not rid his mind of the feet that Herr Hitler had given us nothingand that he was dictating terms, just as though hehad won a war but without having had to fight.While he did not altogether share the FirstLord&apos;s views as to the &quot;March to the East&quot;, henevertheless felt some uncertainty about the ultimateend which he, (Lord Halifax) wished to see accomplished,namely, the destruction of Nazi-ism.    So long asNazi-ism lasted, peace would be uncertain.   For thisreason he did not feel that it would be right to put pressure on Czechoslovakia to accept.    We should laythe case before them.    If they rejected it he imaginedthat Prance would join in, and if France went in weshould join with them.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that he did not put this forward as a final conclusion, but his reflections through the night had provisionallyXsd  him to think that the present proposals involved a difference in principle, and that pointed tentativelyto the conclusion that it would be very difficult toput any pressure on Czechoslovakia.
He also remembered that Herr Hitler had saidthat he had gained his power by words and not bybayonets.     He asked whether we were quite sure thathe had not gained power by words in the present instance,and that if he was driven to war the result might beto help to bring down the Nazi regime.The Foreign Secretary concluded by saying thathe had worked most closely with the Prime Ministerthroughout the long crisis.     He was not quite sure that their minds were still altogether at one.Nevertheless, he thought it right to expose his ownhesitations with complete frankness.THE LORD PRESIDENT of THE COUNCIL said that thePrime Minister had told the Cabinet yesterday that hewas satisfied of the good faith of Herr Hitler&apos;sassurances.     The Prime iiinister had seen Herr hitler and was in a better position to judge than were hiscolleagues.     Nevertheless, the Lord President continued,he felt that he could not trust Herr Hitler.     He quoted in this connection 4, number of renunciations of territorial claims in Europe which had been made by theFtthrer or other representatives of the German Government,viz., on the 21st May, 1935, two months after the re-introduction of conscription in Germany Herr Hitlersaid -&quot;The German Government has broken away from the discriminatory articles of the Treaty,but it herewith solemnly declares that these measures relate exclusively to the points which involve moral and material discrimination- against her people.      It will thereforerespect unconditionally the articles concerningthe mutual relations of nations in other respects, including the territorial provisions,and will bring about the revisions inevitable in the course of time only by the method of-peaceful understandings.&quot;
On the 7th March, 1936, the clay of the re-occupation ofthe Rhineland? Herr Hitler said -&quot;We have no territorial demands to makein Europe.     V7e are aware, above all, thatall the causes of tension which arise as aresult either of faulty territorialprovisions or of a disproportion betweenthe size of populations and their living space,cannot be solved by means of war in Europe.At the same time we hope that human wisdomwill help to mitigate the painful effects of these conditions and to remove causes of- tension by way of gradual evolutionarydevelopment in peaceful collaboration.&apos;&apos;Again, two pronouncements made on 11th and 12th March,1938, after the Anschluss.      On 11th March Field marshal goering assured M. Mastny, the Czechoslovak minister in Berlin, that Germany had no hostile intentions againstCzechoslovakia -&quot;I give you my word of honour^ he said, &quot;andI can add that we wish only for better relations&quot;.On 12th March Baron von ITeurath asked II.. Mastny to call upon him and informed him officially in the name of the reich Chancellor that he had been instructed before thelatterrs departure for Austria to inform M. Mastny thatGermany had no hostile intentions towards Czechoslovakia.He alluded to the interest taken by Germany in the sudeten Germans, but at the same time expressed the hopethat &quot;this domestic question of the Czechoslovak State&quot;might be satisfactorily settled.These undertakings had not been adhered to..     he did not feel that we could trust Herr Hitler&apos;sdeclarations in future.      The Germans dif . ered from usin that to us a promise was a binding obligation, whereasto them it was a statement of intention.He thought the right thing to do was to put the facts to the Czechoslovak Government, and if
4* if 2that Government rejected the German demands and france came to Czechoslovakia^ assistance we should come to the help of Prance.     Ho pressure, however,,should be put upon Czechoslovakia to accept.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION saidthat he thought there was some difference betweenthe declarations quoted by the Lord President of theCouncil and the assurance which Herr Hitler had now given to the Prime Minister, who had clearly exerciseda considerable influence over him.The President said that he viewed the matterrealistically.     The position of Czechoslovakia was entirely changed as the result of the Anschluss.Germany could now enter the country by the southernfrontier and turn the strong western fortifications.Under the present proposals Czechoslovakia would onlylose the fringe of Sudeten.Germans, on whom she could not place reliance.     If she went to war she would lose everything and would he swallowed -sp in afew weeks.     If this country and Prance defeatedGermany in a world war, we could not replaceCzechoslovakia on the map as she existed to-day.     he therefore felt that the lesser of two great evils,from Czechoslovakia&apos;s point of view as well as from our own, was acceptance of herr Hitler&apos;s offer;     andhe thought that we should advise her to accept, yTHE LORD CHANCELLOR said that in his view the matter was mainly one of power.? and that indignationwas the worst guide to the action which this country should take,     ^f Czechoslovakia asked our advicetyp thought it was right to tell her that France, Russia
and Great Britain could not prevent her from beingoverrun and destroyed.     He referred to the fate of abyssinia, which might have been saved if the Hoare-Laval agreement had not been overturned.If we were involved in a world war ourposition was none too favourable.     Russia wasuseless as an ally;    the present state of Prance&apos;sair force was alarming;    Italy would come in against us, and perhaps Japan too.     The heart of the french people was not in this dispute, and he thought thatif heavy losses were inflicted upon them they wouldprobably go out of the war after a couple of months.Such a war would result in the disappearance of czechoslovakia from the map;    and there would befinancial ruin which would make it impossible tocontinue the social services in this country.     He came to the conclusion that the proper advice to give to czechoslovakia in this matter was that she should acceptHerr Hitler&apos;s terms.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERthought that the view taken of the combined allied air forces was somewhat pessimistic.     On the main issue,he thought that the Cabinet could not support theacceptance of these proposals for a number of reasons.On moral grounds the Memorandum was an ultimatum and wascouched in almost offensive terms.     He thought that before long we were bound to be asked whether wesupported or rejected Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals.When Parliament reassembled this issue could notbe avoided.     If we said that we accepted theproposals the result would be such a blow to our
prestige that he thought the Government would fall.THE MINISTER FOR GO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCEhoped that his colleagues would think in terms ofthe difficult questions involved rather than ofthe Parliamentary situation.      In any case it wasimpossible to foresee exactly what the situation would he when Parliament met.He would state his conclusion first,- whichwas that we were under a duty to put the full facts of the position to Czechoslovakia,   . He was not,however, in favour of putting pressure on Czecho-?Slovakia and saying that if she did not accept theproposals we should in no circumstances support her.The facts which should he put to Czechoslovakiaincluded the certainty that France would be anineffective and half-hearted ally in this war, unless we put strong pressure on her.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had considerable confidence in our ultimate victory,yet such a victory might well result in the virtualdestruction of both sides.    He could not feel thatwe had any moral obligation to urge Czechoslovakiato fight.      While our sympathies must be againstacceptance of these proposals, it would be morallyreprehensible to refuse to look the facts in the face.Looking at the matter purely from the point ofview of our interests, it seemed to him that the remedy was worse than the disease, and that it wastherefore not in our interest to go to war.Continuing, the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence said that he agreed that this was not the
end of the matter.     We should not exhort Czechoslovakiato accept Herr hitler proposals, hut we should put the facts clearly before them and explain first, thatif they refused the proposals there was no means of saving Czechoslovakia as a political entity.    Secondly,that they must not assume that  ranee would come totheir aid.     This point would need delicate handling.If France was prepared to put her whole weightinto a war against Germany it might be that theposition would be more favourable than we had previouslythought.The Minister referred to the latest information,which showed that Germany had only a thin couvertureof troops on her western frontier.     It was clearlyof the first importance to ascertain the real fact as to France&apos;s intentions,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought that itwas   impossible to reach definite conclusions beforethe B?ime Minister had seen the French Ministers that evening.The Air Ministry thought that the French must have received some new information about two or three weeks ago, whichhad made them hesitate about going to war with Germany.The Secretary of State for Air mentioned that colonel Lindbergh had been to the Air Ministry..They thought that he had perhaps become an.  unwittingtool of the Germans.     For all that, he had given them a fair, if somewhat superficial, account of theFrench, Russian and German Air Forces.     There was no
doubt that, from the point of view of the air, bothPrance and Russia were in a comparatively weak,position.     Russia&apos;s armament productive capacity,suffered as the result of the recent widespreadpurges.      Colonel Lindbergh had given figures for german production whioh were, considerably higherthan the figure of 600 machines per month, which wasgiven in our calculations.      Prom our point of view,the most hopeful feature was the difficulties which germany was experiencing in regard to personnel.In recent months, they had had a large number of fatalaccidents.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Airsaid that he shared the feelings expressed by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.     We had suffered a humiliation for which we must all take theresponsibility - a responsibility extending backover many years.     It was necessary, however, to look at the matter from the practical point of view,and the present circumstances would show a weakRussia and a doubtful Prance.     He agreed with thePresident of the Board of Education and the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence that the terms shouldbe accepted.     He reached this vOonclusion notwith-rstanding his intense disgust at the terms.He thought that the matter had been put very well by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,and it was both fair and honourable, as well as our duty, to put the facts of the case before Czecho-slovakia.
The Secretary of State for Air said that whatever might he the result of the present negotiations, he had no doubt that all his colleagues were glad that the Prime Minister had paid thesevisits to Germany.     These visits had been received with profound respect and satisfaction throughoutthe world.If, notwithstanding his efforts, war came, itwould be evident that nothing had been spared in thecause of peace.     Further, these visits had made aconsiderable impression in Germany, and had probablydone more to weaken Nazism than any other event inrecent years.The Secretary of State for Air said, therefore,that he was in favour of postponing a final decision until the representatives of the French Governmenthad been seen.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had just been handed a letter from the czechoslovak Minister in London.     The Minister hadbeen instructed to ask to be received by the Frenchand British Ministers when they were in conference that afternoon in order to deliver to them an urgentmessage from his Government.     He assumed that the answer to this request must be in the affirmative.This was agreed to,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that the czechoslovak Government would ask whether, if sherefused Herr Hitler&apos;s terms, France and Great britain would support her.     He thought that the Cabinet should reach an answer to that question that morning.Continuing, the First Lord said that, whengreat moral issues were at stake, there was no timeto weigh out one&apos;s strength too carefully.       He
discounted much, of Colonel Lindbergh^ remarks, asColonel Lindbergh was now a convinced admirer of the nazi regime.The First Lord also thought- that it was right tohave regard to opinion iii the House of Commons, since what happened in the House of Commons was, after all, a fact.The previous week, the Prime Minister had pointedout that his (the First Lord&apos;s) conclusions did not altogether agree with his premises.     A week ago, hethought that any delay which could be obtained was worthwhile and might help to break up the ITasi system.      but when Herr Hitler&apos;s present terms were published, therewould be an explosion of public opinion.   . The Press wasnone too favourable to-day, although the terras published in the Press were better than the actual terms.     Hethought thct the revulsion of public opinion would leadto a defeat of the Government in Parliament, with far-reaching consequences.     Turning to the actual terms, hethought that it was impossible to ask our Minister inPrague, after the vigorous and perhaps excessive pressure which had been applied last week, to apply still further pressure to get the further terms accepted.     He was alsodisturbed at the fact that an inhabitant in the areas tobe transferred, if fleeing from the Nazi terror, could not take his property with him.     He was also afraid that theFrench Government would take the same line as they hadtaken last week, when they had tried to put all theresponsibility for the joint Anglo-French proposals on tothis Government.     He thought that we should now tell the czechoslovak Government that we regarded the terms asIntolerable, and that, if they refused -^he ultimatumpresented to them, we should stand by them and. that we hoped France would do the same.     He thought that thefuture of Europe, of this country and of democracy..was at stake.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE expressed agreement with what the Secretary of State for&quot;Air had said.as to the Prime Minister&apos;s visits to Berchtesgaden and Godesherg.     He had acceptedhis share of responsibility for these two visits.He had hoped that the Prime Minister would havebeen able to secure a pro per solution of thepresent difficulty and also would have been ableto achieve a result which would do more thanpostpone war with Germany.     At the meeting held before the Prime Minister left for Godesberg he(the President) had stated certain conditions whichhe regarded as essential.     These included:*(i)   Proper time for the delimitation ofthe areas to be transferred;    and(ii)   That pending delimitation, the german troops should not occupy the territories.Neither of these conditions had been obtained.Indeed, they had been refused in insolentlanguage, which left him under no delusions.   Inhis view agreement on this basis was quiteunacceptable.     He felt sure that, if these terms were accepted, Herr Hitler&apos;s price would only rise again, and we should then find thatwe had bartered away many of the strong points in our position.No doubt war was horrible but it would be equally horrible in six months&apos;  time.     Further,Germany was not now prepared for a long war,whereas, if we waited, she would be able toextend her influence in South Eastern europe and thereby strengthen her position..
The president agreed that it was impossiblefor the British Government to act as a postoffice.     If we thought the terms were right,then we should put pressure on Czechoslovakia,to accept them.     If we thought they were wrong,we should say so, and should make it clear thatif France carried out her obligations we would come to her help.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies said that he thought that publication of herr Hitler&apos;s proposals would probably lead toan outburst of public indignation.     In thecourse of days that outburst might be stemmed,although he did not feel very great confidenceon this point.     The real point, however, wasto reach a decision on the merits of the case.He thought his colleagues might like to know theviews of the High Commissioners of the Dominions,with whom he had had several discussions in thelast few days.     Mr. te Water, Mr. Dulanty andMr. Massey had all definitely taken the viewthat we had accepted the principle of transfera week ago, and that we ought now to acceptproposals which merely concerned the method ofgiving effect to that principle.     Mr. Brucewas inclined to take the same view, provided    0we made it clear that we would^pfoo&amp;tgfe Rumaniaand Yugoslavia and other countries whosesupport we might need in some future war.Mr. Bruce agreed that we should give a guarantee in such a form as to make it clear that we shouldfight if Germany went any further.
The Colonial Secretary said that, a week ago,he had felt no difficulty about the principle ofself-determination for the Sudeten Germans.      ThePrime Minister had gone back to Germany to getreasonable terms. Through no fault of thePrime Minister the terms offered were shocking.Nevertheless there were certain points about theproposals which were not quite as bad as they appeared to be.     Thus the provision for a plebiscite might mean that Germany got somethingless than the 50% line.     Again, the plebiscite wasto be undertaken by an international commission.The main point which shocked hirn was the demand that these transferred areas should be occupiedby German troops.     His view was that we should use every effort to ensure decent terms for the minorities.      He thought that it must be admitted that the terms really represented a surrender asregards the methods of carrying out the principle on which they had agreed.     Nevertheless, the fact remained that the principle had been accepted, and only the method was at issue.      B^waitewss/.war to-daywas such a disastrous affair that he did not think we should go to war on a question of method,He did not regard it as in any way dishonourableto suffer the present rebuff in the effort to phC****sg-fflffocorvck peace.     His view was, therefore, thatthe present terms should be accepted, but that it shouldbe made quite clear that no further concession could bemade, and that our guarantee of Czechoslovakia should
? 1 9operate from now onwards.     He thought ifr migfrfehtaiva a&quot; great-tnorotlk off&amp;ct if&apos;we. wo pp. %oy declare that if the German Army crossed the new frontierwe should at once go to war with them.As regards Herr Hitler&apos;s intentions, he was afraid that he was not quite so hopeful as thePrime Minister.      Nevertheless, he did not takethe view that if we avoided war now, war in thefuture was inevitable. /(When all was-said&quot;-and donfS, he did not thinkthat we could put pressure to bear on Czechoslovakia.We should, however, put these considerations beforeCzechoslovakia, frankly and fully, and let her make up her own mind.      If Czechoslovakia decided thatthe terms were unacceptable, in that case our decision was as stated in the Prime Minister&apos;s.speech of the 24th March. ,THE. SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SGOTLAND agreed with the Colonial Secretary that we could not bring pressure to bear on Czechoslovakia, but hethought it would be right that, before Czechoslovakiarefused the terms, she should have before her thefull facts as to what we thought would happen ifthe terras were refused, and as to the guaranteewe were prepared to give,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that up to now he thought no fundamental difference of opinionhad been revealed.
It was now clear that Czechoslovakia wouldhave to make immense concessions, and that herr Hitler had abated none of his demands.      Indeed,his demands became daily more preposterous.     Hethought that a vital question of principle was at stake.,Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals in effect amounted to an ultimatum.The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to thefact that in his first letter to Herr Hitler-, thePrime Minister had described the proposals as such that he could not put them forward.     The demandsthemselves were quite unjustifiable and would permit the Germans to get behind the Czech fortified lines.This would make the guarantee doubly, dangerous.    he also objected to German troops occupying the areas inwhich the plebiscite would later he held.     The ideaof orderly transfer had been completely given up.All this would be bad enough, but afterlooking at Herr Hitler&apos;s record, and his intentions as set out in his writings, it was impossible tohave any confidence in him.      If what was now a skedfor was conceded, he would only ask for more later.The L0rd Privy Seal was afraid that we werebeing drawn along and slowly abandoning the moralbasis of our case.     The result, would he thatwe shoixId lose the sympathy of the world and our own moralconviction.     He proposed, therefore, that weshould take the full responsibility of making itclear to Czechoslovakia that we were not prepared toask them to accept the terms.     Further, we should
not shelter behind the French, nor the Frenchbehind us,     We should say to the French that ifthey fulfilled their obligations we should marchwith them.     If the French did not move, a new situation would arise,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said thatif the case was decided by sentiment, there couldbe no doubt whatever as to their Views,     But hecould not dismiss from his mind the almost certainresult of a decision reached on that basis.    he agreed with the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence that it was our duty to place the factsbefore the Czechoslovak Government as objectivelyas possible.The Secretary of State for India said thathe had no doubt that it would be said later that if France and Great Britain had made it clear thatthe terms were unacceptable, since they were based on force, Herr Hitler would have given way,but he felt no confidence in that view.     Herr hitler was not bluffing,    . On the contrary, he was quite prepared to plunge the whole world into war.They were all conscious of what a world v/ar wouldbe like.     The military and naval aspects were for the experts, but he would like to invite attentionto our Achilles heel in the Middle- East,     although we were at peace Palestine absorbed daily larger numbers of British troops.     Pie was also afraid of the attitude which the Moslems of Indiamight adopt.As regards public opinion, he thought that many of those who were now clamouring,, for us. totake up a stronger attitude with Germany wouldadopt a different view when a world war had
&quot;been in progress for a month or so.     The foreign secretary had said that he would not feel safe solong as the Nazi Regime and Herr Hitler existed inGermany.LORD ZETLAND wondered what &apos;sort of regime wouldexist in Germany after a world war.     Might it not beeven more dangerous to us than the Nazi Regime?     Forthese reasons he thought that we should take allpossible steps to avoid the calamity of war.     He didnot suggest that v/e should impose more pressure, butwe must put the full facts objectively to the czechoslovak Government.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER accessedagreement with the last speaker.     There was no disputeabout the fact that Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals were ashocking document.     In particular he drew attentionto the provision In paragraph 5 for the withdrawal ofthe military force during the plebiscite, and pointedout that nothing was said about the withdrawal ofnon-military forces.     He agreed entirely with what theHome Secretary had said about the guarantee.     He thoughtthat it should be made quite clear that, if German troops were allowed up to the new frontier, i?o ohould give anlEsnodiate and unqualified guarantee u^pwsrfct^c a.f^^stt^As regards our advice to Czechoslovakia, it was right to point out that, whatever we did, Czechoslovakiacould not be saved now or hereafter.     Was there a middle course?     On this the Prime Minister must be thefinal judge and he had expressed the view that unlessthe present terms were accepted Czechoslovakia, as nowconstituted, must cease to exist.If Czechoslovakia rejected the terms, did weat once go to war with Germany?
THE CHANCELLOR did not think that we. could put ourselves into a position in which we undertook to make our entrance into a world war dependent upon a decisionof the Government of czechoslovakia.     That (Slovo^nmentmight, for example, take some desperate action which,though it might command our respect, could not, in thecircumstances with which we were now faced,  justify: the participation of this country in the war that might follow.     He was not prepared to place this country ina position in which Czechoslovakia had the final wordon whether this country should he involved in a war.The attitidue which he thought we should be well advised to take vis-a-vis the Czechoslovak Government was -(l)    To set out the facts as we saw themobjectively.(2)    To indicate that we ?/ere prepared to give them a guarantee.(3)    That we should not say that, if theyrejected the proposed terms, we should come to their aid..(4)    That we should ascertain the French attitude.It seemed to be doubted whether the french had definitely decided to stand-by their obligations.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT said that a good dealof guidance would be found from studying the map.Whether the areas concerned were ceded now or later theywould in any case have to be ceded in a few months time.Many things which it was now feared would happen onthe 1st October would inevitably have to take place somemonths after that date, in whatever manner the transferwas carried out.     The main questions which he askedhimself were,&quot; first, whether these terms were the bestwhich could be obtained for Czechoslovakia, second, whetherthe present was the best time for us to attack the NaziGovernment.
It was to be remembered that our fighting forces were in the main organised for defence and not for attack.     He was by no means sure that the hest way ofdisrupting the Nazi Government was to subject it to military attack from outside.     He thought that weshould tell the Czechoslovak Government that, in ourview, they should accept the terms and that, if theyrejected them, they could not look to lis for certainsupport.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he rathershared the views expressed by the Foreign secretary that the alteration in the proposals was not merely oneof method but one of principle.     The real question to him was whether Czechoslovakia should now beinvited to sign terms of surrender.     He thought thatit was impossible for us to press the Czechs to signterms of this nature and that this really followed from what the Pzime Minister had said in paragraph 3 ofhis first letter of the 23rd September to Herr Hitler,THE SECRETARY OF STATE  OR WAR said that therewas nothing to regret in the decision that the PrimeMinister should go to Berchtesgaden and Godesberg,His action had rallied the public opinion of the world.The decision to be taken now rested with the Czechs..The question which he asked himself was whether we had increased our moral obligations to them as the resultof the action which we had talc en.     He thought thatthe issue was now a moral one.     Czechoslovakia was ademocracy, which was inspired by the same ideals as this country and shared our opposition to Nazi tyranny.If we forced Czechoslovakia to yield, we should not beable to escape strong condemnation.     If we put any pressure on Czechoslovakia, we should, in fact, become
allies of Herr Hitler.When the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary-saw the Czechoslovak Minister that afternoon, hethought the best plan would be to lay the facts before him, but also to point out that we took the view thatCzechoslovakia would, be justified in refusing to accept these proposals.(The Cabinet then adjourned and agreedto meet again at 5,0 p.rn, the same day),
2 i t)The Cabinet resumed their discussion ofthe international situation at 3 p.m.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that a message had just been received fromthe French Embassy that a Meeting of the Councilof French Ministers was being held at 2.30 p.m.Arrangements for the departure of the french ministers were quite uncertain, but they might beable to catch a train at 4 p.m.      It was clear,however, that they would not reach London at 5 p.m.In the circumstances he thought that the best plan would be that the Prime Minister and he should offer to see M. Masaryk at about 5 p.m. in orderto receive from him the Czechoslovak Government&apos;message.This was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat he had been much shocked by the style of the document containing the German Government&apos;s proposals.Further, the provision that the whole area shouldbe evacuated by the 1st October gave the proposals the character of an ultimatum.     His first impressionhad been that whatever might be Herr Hitler&apos;s realintentions, it was impossible to put pressure onthe Czechoslovak Government to accept these proposals.The issue, however, was much too big to allow one&apos;judgment to be biassed by considerations of sentiment.He had reached the conclusion that the proper course was not to put any pressure on the Czechseither to accept or to reject these proposals.      Ifwe adopted the latter course he was afraid thatwe might find that we had urged the Czechs to take steps which would result in their destruction.     he also thought that if we urged rejection we were
bound.at the same time to say that we would supportCzechoslovakia hy declaring war on Germany.The Home Secretary added that he did notdisguise from himself the fact that we might soonhe involved in war, hut he thought it was very important that we should not take a final decision until we knew how we should stand with the Dominions.From private information which had recently reached him he thought there was a possibility that if we entered into a war to assist Czechoslovakia the PrimeMinister of Canada would take a referendum on theproposal whether Canada should join with us, andthat this proposal might well he rejected.The Home Secretary also thought that it was of the utmost importance that the countries involved(Great Britain, France and Russia) should togetherexamine the military position as impartially aspossible.      Until this had been done he thoughtno final decision should be taken.The Home Secretary asked whether we could not make something of Herr Hitler&apos;s statement that theseproposals did not constitute an   ultimatum and ourselves suggest counter proposals.     He thoughtthat if need be we should offer to send a divisionof British troops to Czechoslovakia, notwithstanding the risks involved, to see that the transfer of territory was carried out in an orderly way.Finally, he hoped that before we went so faras to say to Czechoslovakia or France that we would join them in war, we should discuss the military aspects with the Chiefs of Staff.      So far aspassive defence was concerned, the longer the delay the stronger our position would become.     He also thought that consideration should be given to thequestion whether, if war broke out, it might not be in the
interests not merely of ourselves but of our allies,that we should delay joining in0THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE A!33 fisheries said that, from the point of view of his Department,if we were to he involved in war the sooner adecision was reached the better, as the ploughingseason was now nearly over, and unless a decision was reached in a week or so it would soon he too late to take any steps to increase our foodproduction until next Spring,On the major issue involved, no-one who knew what would he the consequences of war would lightlyembark upon it.     But there was a feeling in thiscountry that war with Germany was quite inevitable,and that if the bastion of Czechoslovakia was surrendered the position would really be worsened:,The Minister referred to some of the matters which encouraged this belief in the inevitabilityof war0      Hitherto matters had been discussed inthe Cabinet on the assumption that Herr hitler was a complete autocrat.     He doubted whether thiswas correct.     He thought that to some extent herr hitler was the servant of the machine he had created, and of the doctrine that he had expounded.He thought that Herr Hitler, with his strongpersonality and demagogic power, was useful tothe Party, but that he was dependent upon theconcurrence of the Party leaders for the steps which he took, and that there were other primarysources of energy in the German system.     Heinstanced the mysterious delay in the reply tothe Prime Minister&apos;s letter and the sequence -ofevents after the Nuremberg speech, when it appeared that the speech had not taken quite the form
expected and the Sudeten-Germans had anticipatedthe immediate arrival of German troops in Czecho-slovakia.Another matter which fostered belief in theinevitability of war with Germany was the proposed guarantee, which filled him with some anxiety.One possible foreign policy was directed towardsensuring that potential enemies were occupied withfrontiers remote from their own country and in whichwe had no interest.     Another possible policy was toencircle a potential enemy with powerful foes.    It couldnot be said that the iDroposed guarantee to Gzechoslo-slovakia had the merits of either of these policies.There was also the psychological factor,namely that relief at a decision to declare warsolved the conflict in the mind.      This was a real danger, and he was sure that we must still make every effort to ensure peace.Herr Hitler&apos;s Memorandum containing his proposals was as difficult a document as one couldbe asked to accept.     He found great difficulty,in pressing Czechoslovakia to accept it.     At thesame time he thought that we should express asclearly as possible the military position as we saw it if Czechoslovakia became involved in war.It might not be easy to draw a line between a starkpresentation of the facts and pressure, but hethought that the line could be drawn.     He also thought it was important to get back to theposition of acting as &quot;honest brokers&quot;.      It was not for us to accept these proposals.     His conclusion was that we should abide by the policy formulated by the Prime Minister on the 21st May that weshould not commit ourselves to engaging in war
*) o qautomatically.    By adhering to this policy we were more likely to he able to throw our weight on the side of peace^ 5 ^ lcU^ o[^&apos; .        ,    ^, ,   ojAs regards public opinion^M w ar was declared nowthere would no doubt, in Sir Robert Walpole&apos;s phrase,be a ringing of bells,/.tout before long there would nodoubt be a wringing of hands.&quot;-fy&apos;/L (a^r,(*-THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that he did not acepptthe inevitability of war.    They all detested the Nazisystem and methods, and there was, no doubt, a section ofpublic opinion which was vocal for war.    But in his view the section of opinion which thought that this issueshould not be allowed to provoke a world war was certainlystronger.After analysing the various ways in which theissue might arise, the Minister of Labour summarised theposition as it appeared to him as follows.   All three governments had agreed to a transfer of territory.   Theareas to be transferred did not differ materially.    Thepoint of difference concerned the precise method of transfer.    The terms of the Memorandum were highlyobjectionable, but we had to face the fact that unless these terms were accepted we should almost certainly be faced with a world war.The Minister of Labour thought that the czechoslovak Government would doubtless ask for advice.The Prime Minister had seen Herr Hitler, and the PrimeMinister was better able to judge the prospects than anyof his colleagues.    Por himself he found it difficult toknow what answer to give, but he was much impressed by what the Prime Minister had said the previous night, whenhe had stated that although his first reaction to theMmmorandum had been one of indignation   after weighing
it up he had come to the conclusion that its real meaningwas far less open to objection than its form implied.He was sure that the time had not yet come when we should give up our efforts to obtain peace by negotiation.   Norought we to shelter behind the attitude of France.THE PRIME MINISTER said that all his colleagues had now spoken and had disclosed their points of view.There had been some difference of opinionc as was onlyto be expected. Although he had given expression tocertain views which he had formed as the result of hissecond visit, he never expected other members of theCabinet to accept those views as a final judgment.The first point he wished to make was that hewas sure that even those of his colleagues who did not see matters in precisely the same light -as himself waul^-be the last- to-.wish- to -magnify differences-    They were faced with a critical situation, and it was important that the Cabinet should present a united front.    Whenhe came to the position we- were in- to-dsa-y. &amp;xva. to- tfc-eimmediate.. de^xsiort which had to be takenj he did notthink he would find any real differences.    In the courseof the discussion certain of his colleagues had spokensomewhat loosely of &quot;accepting&quot; or &quot;rejecting&quot; herr hitler&apos;s proposals.    It was, of course, clear that itwas not for us to accept or reject them, or, indeed,to feel any humiliation in regard to these terms.    Theproposals were not addressed to us, and we were onlyacting as an intermediary.   The final responsibilityfor acceptance or rejection lay with the czechoslovak government.
The more immediate question was the attitudewe should take up at the forthcoming interview withthe representatives of the French Government andwith the Czechoslovak Minister.       The question, hadbeen asked whether we should put pressure on the czech Government to accept the proposals contained inthe Hitler Memorandum.     He shared to the full theview expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for the Colonies as to thecharacter of this document.     He hoped that hiscolleagues would not think that he was insensible tothe moral considerations involved.      In the past weekhe had gone through much wrestling of spirit and agonyof mind, and at moments the responsibility that layupon his shoulders had been almost unbearable.This matter must not, of course, be looked atmerely from the point of view of material considerations..All sorts of factors must be weighed up, and it mustbe realised that on the decision taken depended the lives and happiness of millions of their fellowcountrymen.There had also been talk of &quot;pressure&quot; onCzechoslovakia.     What did this mean?     Nobody suggestedthat if the Czechs rejected the terms we should go towar against them.     The assumption was ridiculous, butit served to illustrate the point that there was nopressure which we could exert in the literal sense.     he felt sure that those who talked about &quot;pressure&quot; did not suggest that we were debarred from putting beforeCzechoslovakia all the considerations which should properly be borne in mind in reaching a decision.     Weowed it to them to dp no less than this, and not to let them take a decision without knowing what was involved.
O O  ?The only pressure which we could, exerciseon Czechoslovakia was negative.     We could say thatIf they rejected the terms proposed we should not come to their assistance.     But we could not makeany such statement, because it was. not onlyCzechoslovakia that was involved, but France also.In his speech of the 24th March, andsubsequently, he had said that we could not afford to see France defeated, and overrun by Germany.From this it followed that, if France went to war, itwas almost inevitable that we ourselves should be involved.     We could not, therefore, say to czechoslovakia that if they rejected these proposals we should remain completely aloof, since that mightnot be the case.     The Prime .Minister said that headmired the logic of the First Lord&apos;s views, buthe did not agree with them.     The First Lord wishedto tell the Czechoslovak Government to reject theproposals and to say that we wotild come in on their side.      It was clear, however, that we could not take that course this afternoon unless the whole cabinet was united in support of it, and it was evident thatthis was not the case.     For the time being, therefore,that course was out of the range of possibilities.In the last resort it seemed likely thatCzechoslovakia&apos;s attitude would be determined bythe attitude of France.     If encouraged by france (and perhaps in any event), Czechoslovakiamight resist Germany.      Sooner or later theFrench Government would have to decide on theirattitude.    /
Continuing, the Prime Minister said that,&apos; sofar as he had summed up the situation, he thoughtthat there was little difference of opinion amonghis colleagues.     He did not think that it wasnecessary to take any immediate decision which went beyond the policy which had already beenaccepted by the Government,     Nevertheless itwas clear that a position had arisen in which we might before long be involved in war.      If thathappened,, it was essential that we should enterwar united, both as a country and as an Empire,It was of the utmost importance, therefore,  that whatever steps we took, we should try to bring thewhole country and Empire along with us, andshould allow public opinion to realise that allpossible steps had been taken to avoid a  conflict.The Prime Minister therefore proposed that,in the forthcoming discussions with the FrenchGovernment and with the Czechoslovak Minister,our action should be on the following basis:-(i)    We should not say that If the proposals were rejected we undertook to declare war on Germany.(ii)    Equally we should not say that if theproposals were rejected we should in no circumstances declare war on germany.(iii)   We should put before the representativesof the French and CzechoslovakGovernments the full facts of thesituation, as we saw them, in theirtrue light.
The Home Secretary had suggested thatin the interval before October 1st counterproposals should be submitted to Germany with aview to ensuring that the transfer of territorywas effected in an orderly fashion.     be referred to a proposal which the Foreign secretary had mentioned to him.     Sir Frederick Mauricehad told the Foreign Secretary that he thought itwas possible that a proposal for a mixed forceof German and British ex-Service men to act asa screen to occupy the Sudeten German territoriesbefore the advance of the German troops mightbe accepted by Herr Hitler.     Arrangements had now been made for Sir Frederick Maurice to fly to Germany to put this proposal to herr Hitler.     He did not know whether thisproposal was likely to &quot;be accepted, but it was worth examination.He rather doubted whether in all thecircumstances much could be done on the linesof the Home Secretary&apos;s suggestion for counterproposals.       Herr von Ribbentrop,  at theend of the discussions, had told him veryearnesiOy that Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals couldnot be made the subject of bargaining and thathe hoped that no counter proposals would besubmitted, as from his knowledge of the Fuhrerhe knew that they would not be entertained.Nevertheless he (the Prime Minister) did not altogether exclude counter1 proposals.     He thoughtHerr Hitler wanted peace, and that if the point a tissue was not very large he might be induced toaccept some compromise.
General discussion followed on the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement in the course of which thefollowing points were made.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thoughtthat the Home Secretary&apos;s suggestion for counterproposals should he pursued.It was suggested that the Czech Governmentwere not called upon to give an immediate &quot;yes&quot; or&quot;no&quot; to Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals and that, inthe meantime, Herr Hitler might he ashed toagree to some modification of the terms suggested.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR tfioughtthat it was vital to know what were the intentions of the French Government before a decision was reached.     On the other hand, if theFrench said that they were prepared to supportCzechoslovakia and asked us what was our attitude, he did not think that we could refuseto give a reply.The Secretary of State for War also suggested that the position had been somewhatmodified by the statement made hy the Prime      )Minister in paragraph 4 of his letter of the23rd September that if German troops moved into the Sudeten German areas as the Fuhrer had proposed, there was no doubt that the czechoslovak government would have no option but to ordertheir forces to resist.     He thought that this statement went some way to committing us tosupport the Czechoslovak Government.THE PRIME MINISTER said he could not accept this view and this paragraph amountedto no more than a statement of the situation as he
had seen it, according to the information at his disposals      It was merely a statementof his view as to what action the czechoslovak government would take.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR suggested thatthe Prime Minister should conduct negotiationswith the representatives of France and Czechoslovakiaon the basis suggested and should ascertain theirviews.     Until that had been done he thought thatno further decision could be reached,,    He suggested,however that a further report should be made tothe Cabinet when the views of France and czechoslovakia had been ascertained,,The Secretary of State for Air also suggestedthat inter-staff talks should take place betweenthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff and theChief of the French Genei^al Staff.      If possiblethe Russians might be associated with these talks.&quot;THE PRESIDENT OF T/IE BOARD OF TRADE&apos;thought that it was undesirable that there shouldbe any further delay in reaching a decision.Time was an important factor and he thought weshould definitely notify our decision to theFrench and Czechoslovak Governments at once.    he also thought that immediate steps should be taken&apos;to set on foot further precautionary measures.. -The Prime Minister&apos;s speech of the 24th March hadbeen perfectly correct in the circumstances in whichit was delivered, but the circumstances were nolonger hypothetical and in his view the time had come when we should define our policy in clear and unmistakeable languages,       He suggested  **
that we should say to France that,  if Czechoslovakiaobjected to the terms proposed, and if France was prepared to support Czechoslovakia energetically, weshould join with France,THE MINISTER OF HEALTH supported the Home Secretary&apos;1 suggestion that we should endeavour to obtain some modification in the terms proposed.      He thought that anyconclusion which involved integral acceptance of theterms proposed would be very difficult to justify,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointedout that it was for the Czechoslovak Government and not for ourselves to accept the proposals,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggested&apos;that if the Czechoslovak Government were prepared toaccept the proposals, he thought we should be in aposition to join in giving them an immediate guaranteewithout waiting for the transfer of the territory to the reich,/   He thought this was one of the factors which weshould lay before the Czechoslovak Government0THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that therewas a risk of a marked difference of opinion on thismatter.     He agreed, however, that the essential point was to ascertain the views of the French.     When that had been done the Cabinet should be reassembled.In the course of further discussion, the HomeSecretary&apos;s proposal for joint conversations between britain, France and Russia in order that the cabinet might be in possession of the best military information and advice met with supijort.
The view had also been expressed that it would bedesirable for an immediate meeting of the Service ministers and Chiefs of Staff in order to discuss the furtherdefence measures which do not involve mobilisation setout in Annex A to the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CP. 207 (38)).It was agreed that the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should arrange a meeting: in the course of the evening, with a view to a Report being made to the PrimeMinister.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs reported that he had received a message to the effect,that the representatives of the French Government wouldbe available to start conversations at 9 p.m.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY AND THE PRESIDENTOF THE BOARD OF TRADE expressed some anxiety that theattitude to be adopted by representatives of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in these conversations had not been more fully defined, and the latter suggested that the conversations might be divided into two parts.    In thefirst part of these conversations the views of the FrenchGovernment should be ascertained.    There would then be an adjournment, in the course of which the Cabinet shouldbe reassembled and acquainted with the attitude of theFrench Government before any final decisions were reached.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed with thissuggestion.    It was clear that the representatives of theFrench Government would have to stop overnight and hethought that this suggestion could be adopted withoutinconvenience.It was agreed that the Cabinet should oe ready to re-assemble the same evening at short notice.It was left to the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary to settle whether M. Masaryk should be seen beforethe meeting with the representatives of the French Govern-ment, or whether the interview with him should be postponed.
G PIT GLU Si ON 8.The Cabinet agreed(i)    That no final decision, should be  ...reached in regard to the policy to be adopted in regard to herr hitler proposals untilthe attitude of the FrenchGovernment had been ascertained.&apos;(ii)    That for this purpose the conversations with the FrenchGovernment should be dividedinto two parts, and that theCabinet should be reassembledafter the first part of the conversations have taken place,but before these conversationswere concluded.(iii)    That the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should convene ameeting of the Service ministers and the Chiefs of Staff toconsider the further defence measures set out in Annex &apos;A!to CP.  207(38), and to reportto the Prime Minister thereon.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.25th September, 1938.
