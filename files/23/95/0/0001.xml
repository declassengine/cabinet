On the 31st August the French had begun tocall up Reservists and to man the Maginot Line.     Onthe same date Sir Nevile Henderson returned to berlin and gave Baron von Weizsacker a strong personal warningas to the probable attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government.On the 1st September Sir Nevile Hendersonrepeated his personal warning to Herr von Ribbentrop0On the 1st and 2nd September Herr Henlein saw herr hitler at Berchtesgaden and delivered to him a message from Lord Runciman,     Herr Henlein had then returnedto Prague expressing confidence in Herr Hitler&apos;speaceful attitude.     On the 2nd September the Sudeten-German representatives had practically rejectedDr. Benes&apos;s proposals of the 24th August and had putforward counter-proposals0On the 3rd September Mr. Newton had madestrong representations to Dr. Benes on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, urging him to go to the utmostlimit of concessions.On the same day the French defensive preparations had been intensified in view of reportsof German preparations on the French frontier.On the 7th September the new Czeoh proposals had been communicated to Dr, Kundt,     These proposals were considered by Lord Runciman to be a satisfactory basis for negotiation.     That -evening, however, the&apos;Mahrish-Ostrau incident had occurred, which caused the sudeten representatives to suspend negotiations.On the same day ,rThe Times&quot; had published anunhappy leading article advocating consideration of thesecession of certain fringe areas as a possible alternative solution?
dOn that day he (the Secretary of State)received a visit from the French Ambassador urging thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should send a message to herr hitler making their attitude quite clear.     Reports ofthis meecing and of a subsequent meeting on 9th Septemberare, contained in Foreign Office telegrams to ParisNumbers 262 and 264.On the 8th September M. Daladier had had an interview with Sir Eric Phipps and had stated in effectthat if Germany entered Czechoslovakia France wouldmobilise and declare war.     Both the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and Sir Eric Phipps had repeated thedesire of His Majesty1 s Government that the French would consult us before taking any action which would involvethem in war.On the 9th September Sir Nevile Henderson had seen Herr von Ribbentrop at Nuremberg.     He had taken theopportunity to repeat in clear and strong language the warning which he had previously given to him, ^On the same day (9th September), a meeting ofthe prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer had been held to considerwhether, in the light of the information which continuedto be received from responsible official sources inGermany as to Germany&apos;s intentions, it was necessary to deliver a further and formal warning to Germany.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he, of course, kept in mind the view, which had been
sbo strongly expressed at the Meeting of ministers on the 30th August, against delivering a furtherwarning to germany     On the other hand, that view had related to the delivery of a public warning and,at their Meeting on the 30th August, Ministers hadnot had before them the later information, sincereceived, bearing on Germany&apos;s intentions.     the gist of this information was that Herr Hitler had decided.to march into Czechoslovakia on some datebetween the 18th and the 29th September, relying on being able to clear up the situation with greatrapidity0The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs referred to telegram Noa 354 of the 9th September to berlin, which contained a Statement which it was proposed should be delivered to Herr Hitler withthe object of giving another clear warning as to theconsequences of recourse to force.     It was arranged that Sir Nevile Henderson should not deliver this message until he received specific instructions tothis effect.It so happened that just at this time a message had been received (which in the event turned out to be untrue) to the effect that Sir nevile henderson was having a long conversation with herr hitler^     It was felt that it would be very risky to instruct our Ambassador to deliver a formal warninguntil we knew exactly how the position was left bythis interview.     The instructions to deliver this message were, therefore, suspended until a report wasreceived from Sir Nevile Henderson.,
This report was received on the afternoon of saturday, the 10th September.    Three letters setting outSir Nevile&apos;s views of the position had been circulated asCP. 196 (38),    The second of these two letters gaveSir Nevile&apos;s reactions on receiving the message containedin telegram No.  354.    Sir Nevile was awkwardly placed atNuremberg, living in a railway carriage without the use ofcyphers.    It would be seen from his letter that he had urged, with all the force at his command, that he should notbe instructed to make the official demarche proposed in telegram No.  354.    Sir Nevile reported that the moderateelements in thomOTaww^ PoPty, in particular, were most- &apos;i. V&apos;,&apos;.&quot;&apos;&quot;.&apos;.-&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;:/ &apos; . - &apos;&apos; -      . &quot;strongly against what they termed the &quot;repetition of21st May&quot;.It had, therefore, been decided to telegraph toSir Nevile Henderson that, provided he was satisfied thathe had conveyed the substance of the instructions containedin telegram No- 354,  and that our meaning and Intentionswere fully understood by Germany, the official demarcheneed not be delivered.To complete the historical summary, on the 9thSeptember, consideration had been given to what the FirstLord had termed a symbolic act which might speak more effectively than words.    In the absence of the First Lord,the First Sea Lord had been brought into consultation and action had been taken (1) to issue orders to commissionfour Destroyer Minelayers now in reserve;  (2) to issue orders for the First Mine Sweeping Flotilla to be brought up to full complement and to be placed under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet.    This action had been announced in the Press on the 10th September,
with the result that the German Naval Attache had calledat the Admiralty that day and had been told by Rear--AdmiralTroup Director of Naval Intelligence that the naval measures taken were limited in scope, and were the result of thedisturbed state of Europe.    He had added that everybodyin England knew that if France were involved in war, weshould be likewise.    The German Naval Attache had been greatly shaken and had expressed himself as being over-whelmed.    He had replied that he had never thought untilnow that such a position could come about.    The impression that he had received had been conveyed to the german foreign Office and Admiralty, and to Nuremberg.On the 11th September consideration had beengiven to carrying out a further naval step, which had been proposed by the First Lord, namely, issuing orders for the crews of the Seventh Destroyer Flotilla to be brought up to full complement.    It had been decided not to take this action.    The bringing of this Destroyer Flotilla up to full complement would be a measure of a somewhat more&quot;offensive&quot; character, and it. had been felt that it wasunwise to have this action prominently noted in the presson the very morning of the day when Hitler was putting thefinishing touches to his speech.The Foreign Secretary reported that, with thePrime Minister, he had seen Mr. Winston Churchill on theprevious day.    Mr. Churchill&apos;s proposition was that weshould tell Germany that if she set foot in Czechoslovakiawe should at once be at war with her.    Mr.  Churchill agreedthat this line of action was an advance on the line ofaction which he had proposed some two or three weeksearlier, but he thought that by taking it we should incurno added risk.
3!Jve-^por^ign ^Secretary said that he had also seen mr. Anthony Eden, who had expressed complete agreement withthe line taken.    Mr. Eden&apos;s letter in to-day&apos;s Times had &quot;been published with the full concurrence of the Prime Minister and himself.Lord Lloyd had also been among the Foreign Secretary&apos;svisitors on the previous day.    His only concern was whetherSir Nevile Henderson had succeeded in making our attitudequite plain.    He had agreed that we could not go againstSir Nevile Henderson&apos;s strongly expressed advice.The United States Ambassador had also called on theForeign Secretary, and had been received by the Prime minister the previous night.    Lord Halifax thought that  there was acertain spectacular or moral value to be drawn from these visits.The United States Ambassador had asked whether twoUnited States cruisers should come into Portland and he had said that was a matter for the United States Government.Lord Halifax, then proceeded to give his own diagnosisof the position.    He thought that Herr Hitler was possibly oreven probably mad.    He might have taken a definite decision toattack Czechoslovakia Hcoute que coute&quot;.    This view of theposition.- the first hypothesis - was supported by a good dealof information from responsible quarters, conveyed to us atsome risk.If Herr Hitler had made up his mind to attack,  it was probable that nothing which we could do would stop him.    Therewas a body of opinion which thought that he could be stopped bya direct ultimatum.    This was, however, at the best a very doubtful view.    He had been impressed by what he had been toldby ppulfcs-bSUr 0unwell Evtsao who had just returned from Germany.The story was that a report from the German Ambassador in Pariswas brought to Hitler to the effect that, if he attackedCzechoslovakia, France,  the United Kingdom and the United Statesof America would all fight him.    Herr Hitler was said to haveread the report and then to have thrown it aside, saying that-7-
1(1it was an interesting document which could he dealt with -with after action had &quot;been taken.In the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view, any seriousprospect of getting Herr Hitler back to a sane outlookwould probably be irretrievably destroyed by any actionort our part which would involve him in what he would regard as a public humiliation.     This view of thesituation was supported by all those who were in aposition to judge the facts.The Foreign Secretary added that he was alsoinfluenced by the consideration that he was not preparedto make a statement until he was perfectly certain thathe was in a position to carry it out     He was notprepared to say that we would go to war on the issue of czechoslovakia alone, since it was impossible to say in what form that issue might arise,,     To say without qualification that we were prepared to go to war todefend Czechoslovakia would, in fact, put the decisionof peace or war in the hands of others than ourselves0Turning to the second hypothesis, if Herr hitler had not definitely made up his mind to attack Czecho-Slovakia, there was a great probability that a warning inthe nature of an ultimatum would do great harm., would not jadd to the force of what we had already said, and mightwell have the effect of driving Herr Hitler over the edge.The Foreign Secretary put the question &quot;Have weup to the present moment done everything within our power?&quot;He thought that we could answer that question in the affirmative.     Up to the present moment we had actedlargely&apos;with our eyes on Herr Hitler&apos;s speech to-night.Those in a position to judge did not think that the speechwould be catastrophic or would contain surprises.      Itmight, indeed, be an attempt to chloroform this countryand the world generally0     The Foreign Secretary thought the wise course was to await Herr Hitler?s speech and thenreview the situation.     A number of suggestions had already
been made and might be considered,      Thusj there was thesuggestion tentatively put forward by Mo Leger to Sir E.Phipps of a Four-Power Conference.     Again, the French had stated that they were prepared to accept any suggestionput forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government or by Lord Runcimanto settle the Sudeten German problem.     Lord Runciman mightwell be in a position to offer some suggestions in the courseof the next, two or three days.Lord Halifax added that he did not wish to go into these possibilities in detail now, provided that they could beconsidered later at a further meeting of the Cabinet, whichmight have to be called at short notice.In reply to a question by the Secretary of State forAir, the Foreign Secretary stated that Lord Runciman mightbe prepared to contemplate making proposals on his ov/nresponsibility? but had not committed himself to this course.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had nothing to add tothe Foreign Secretary&apos;s very complete account of the inter-national position.     He mentioned that Mr. Attlee had written to him informing him of the demand of the Labour Party forthe summoning of Parliament.     Mr. Attlee&apos;s letter had crossed a letter from the Prime Minister inviting Mr0 Attleeto come and see him.     At the Meeting of Ministers held onthe   50th August, it had been agreed that no approach should at present be made to the Leader of the Opposition, but thePrime Minister said he had thought that the time had come whenthe Leader of the Opposition should be acquainted with de ve development  s .At the interview, at which the Foreign Secretary hadbeen present, Mr. Attlee had not himself raised the questionof summoning Parliament.     The Prime Minister had mentioned the matter and had said that it would be brought before to-day^ Cabinet Meeting, after which a considered reply
would &quot;bo sent to Mr. Attlee.     The Prime Minister told Mr.Attlee, however, that he thought that the Cabinet wouldprobably take the view that in the present delicate stateof affairs it would be undesirable to have a public debate.He had added that a situation might of course arise later in which it would be necessary to summon Parliament.The Prime Minister said that his interview withMr. Attlee had taken place on the same day that sir nevile henderson had seen Herr von Pibbentrop, Pield-marshal goering, and other German leaders, at Nuremberg.     He had repeated to Mr. Attlee a sentence from a telephone message from Sir ITevile Henderson reporting these conversations, tothe effect that Sir Hevile was satisfied   that there wasno illusion   in Germany among the people who counted as tothe attitude of Great Britain.Mr. Attlee had said that the Labour Party were some-what uneasy about two points.     The first was whether theleaders ixi Germany had been made sufficiently aware of theposition of this country.     The second was whether we hadexercised as much pressure on Berlin as on Prague.The prime Minister thought that the first point hadbeen answered by the sentence which he had quoted from SirITevile Hendersons report of his conversations.   As regardsthe second, the Foreign Secretary had said that we hadexerted all the pressure which we could.     Mr. Attlee had appeared   satisfied and had said that he would be careful to avoid giving any impression that this country tvasdisunited.     The Prime Minister added that he had undertaken to keep Mr. Attlee informed, and was to see him again on tuesday.     He had also arranged to sec Sir archibald sinclair on the same date.
THE MINISTER FOR CO-OEDIITATION OP DEFENCE said thathe wanted to &quot;be quite clear as to v/hat was the impressionwhich Sir Nevile Henderson was satisfied that he hadconveyed to German leaders.In reply the FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed to the para-graph in telegram No. 354 starting &quot;Prance having thus become involved it seems to His Majesty1s Governmentinevitable that the sequence of events must result ina general conflict from v/hich Great Britain could not stand aside.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that the view which we hadconveyed to Prance represented the probable sequence ofevents rather than a definite commitment.     If Germanyattempted to use force after the negotiations had got sofar, it was our opinion that the French would probablybe involved, and, if so, our opinion was that we. couldnot stand aside,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS also referred to a sentence in Sir Nevile Henderson&apos;s letterof the 10th September (&quot;II&quot; in CP.-196 (38)) which reads -&quot;If the worst comes, His majesty&apos;s government can truly say thatthe instructions they are nowsending will have already been communicated by me to Ribbentropand Goering, to Neurath andothers.&quot;It was true that v/e had no precise record of v/hatSir Nevile Henderson had said, but this was a prettystrong statement.
THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that in his view the message set out in telegram No. 554 could not he described as a &quot;warning ultimatum.&quot;     He thought it was an admirable statement of the position, which ought notto upset Herr Hitler,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY here interposed that whenhe spoke of a &quot;warning ultimatum&quot; he had in mind rather the line which Mr. Churchill had suggested that we shouldtake.Continuing, the FIRST LORD said that&apos; he was ratherdisconcerted by the fact that public opinion, both inthis country and abroad, was insistent that we should make an official demarche to Germany setting but the actionwhich we should take if she used force.    &apos; V/e had not taken this course on the advice&apos; of Sir Hevile Henderson only*The language of his messages, however, did not reassurehirii.    It seemed that the solution which Sir He vilecontemplated would result in a complete surrender on thepart of the Czechs.     He thought it was quite likely that herr Hitler&apos;s speech tonight would be a moderate speech,and that he would take this line in order to improve hisposition vis-a-vis world opinion before delivering theblow which he intended to deliver at a later date.     Hesuggested that, the handing to the   German Government of a formal warning on the lines of that set out in telegram &apos;No. 554 should be now considered by the Cabinet.
. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the question with whichthey were at present concerned was whether a message on thelines of telegram No. 354 should be delivered before herr hitler&apos;s speech tonight.      The question of the delivery ofsuch a message after that speech was a matter which could befurther considered at a later date.      The immediate question was whether, if a message was sent on these lines now,  itwould stop Herr Hitler from committing himself in his speechtonight to some violent action.      Sir Nevile Henderson, whowas on the spot and familiar with the local atmosphere, wasemphatic that the message proposed would not have this effect.It was impossible for us to disregard the Ambassador1sstrongly expressed opinion on this subject, an opinion,moreover, which was supported by many other people in Gemnany.All these people gave the same advice, namely, that if herr hitler had riiade up his mind to use force,  the proposed messagewould not stop him,  and that if he had not made up his mind,the proposed message would be likely to drive him to adoptthe course we were anxious to avoid.The Prime Minister added that Mr. Anthony Eden hadconcurred in this view.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER pointed outthat the French Government had virtually agreed to consultH.M. Government before they took action which involved them&apos;in war.      He presumed that in such an event a decision wouldbe taken by the Cabinet.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said it&quot;was not merely a question of whether we were to support Prance, but of whether we should adopt so non-commital an attitude that France would always be looking over her shoulder and wondering what our attitude was going to be.
Much had happened in the last few months.       He referredto the Prime Minister&apos;s speech and the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s speech at Lanark;    the pressure we had put onthe Czechs to make concessions, and the sending of LordRunciman to Prague.       We should he in a most humiliatingposition if, notwithstanding all these steps, we were todecide that, in view of our armament position, we could not support the French.THE&apos;PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed that a decisionof vital importance, such as that referred to &quot;by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, must come before theGabinet.      He undertook to make every possible effort tosecure that every Minister was given an opportunity to take part in discussions on these vital issues,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that france must not be given the impression that we had arrivedat any firm decision either to support her, or not to supporther in the event of her becoming involved in war.    No decisionhad, in fact, been reached on this point.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND referred to theGerman Naval Attache&apos;s interview and asked what weight orforce it would carry in Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when the Naval Attachehad read the news of these measures, he had idealised exactly what they involved.      He had put together this news withhis information as to the other steps which we had taken,e.g.  the movement of ships in the Mediterranean and the ships which had been kept at the southern ports, notwithstanding the naval manoeuvres.     He had thus detected that our ships were at their war stations and his report would be calculated to draw attention to all these points. /
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND enquired whether thereJiad. been any further reactions from the Dominions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (in the absenceof the secretary of State for the Dominions) said that theDominions had been kept fully informed of the position.The only Dominion which had sent any comment was theGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia, which had suggested that we should advise the Czechoslovak Governmentto do something generous, and advise them that unless theydid so, we should wash our hands of them.     It so happenedthat this telegram had &quot;been followed shortly afterwards bythe new offer made by the Czechoslovak Government,    Generally,the attitude of the Dominions had been very much what he hadforecast at the Meeting of Ministers on the 30th August.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS added thathe had seen Mr. Vincent Massey, who had said that while a minority In Ganada might be in favour of our taking someforward action, the majority would be against such action,in the hopes that we should not be involved in war.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthe point raised by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterwas of considerable Importance.      It was very difficult togo far enough without at the same time going too far.Lord Halifax then read paragraphs 2 and 3 of his telegram to Sir E. Phipps giving an account of his interview with the French Ambassador on the 7th September (these paragraphs are reproduced, as Appendix^! to these Conclusions),What the French wanted us to say was, of course,  thatthe moment they were involved in war we should come in ontheir side.      In. this connection the Foreign Secretary read a private and confidential letter addressed to him by oirS. Phipps reporting a conversation between the latter and
M- Bonnet.    (This letter is reproduced as Appendix II tothese Conclusions.)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that it was clear we might have a very short time in which to make up our minds on the question of what line we should take if Prancemobilised and declared war.      It was clear that the decision taken &quot;by H.M, Government committed the Empire.     difficulties would, arise if we reached a decision without allowing timefor what the Dominions would regard as reasonable consultation in the circumstances.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he wasseeing the High Commissioners that afternoon.    It might be necessary  to request them to stay in London and not go- &apos;&apos;,&apos;- V-::-.;&apos;    &apos; .&apos;        - \&apos;V:&apos;Geneva. He thought that a certain amount, but not a great dealof additional delay, might be necessary in order that we should put ourselves in the right position with the Dominions.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he was unwilling to speakas most of his colleagues had far more knowledge of the questions at issue than himself.    Everyone spoke as though, if Prance was involved in war, there were only two alternatives, namely, thatwe should or should not join with her.     A possible thirdcourse occurred to him, namely, that-we might tell Prance thatour present military position was weak, but that given alittle time, we could put ourselves into a far more satisfactoryposition.     At the same time, we would not stand by and seePrance overcome,. and if there was any risk of that happening,we would intervene at once.    In the meantime Prance should hold the Maginot Line.     According to the Chiefs of Staff, the time factor was of the greatest importance.The Lord Chancellor also referred to the general impression that Italy was unwilling to support Germany, that Italy wouldstay out as long as we stayed out, but that if we came in,Italy would join Germany.    It seemed to him, therefore, thatPrance might be willing to agree that we should stand aside-IS-
ISat the outset of the war.      The neutrality of Italy would heof great importance to France, having regard to the difficultyof maintaining their communications with Tunis if Italy were hostile.this third course, which he might describe as a &quot;dilatory&apos;course, had been carefully considered.    For his part, he wouldbe satisfied with whatever conclusion was reached by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not think that a discussion of the various alternatives with which we might be faced could be very fruitful at the present moment.      If andwhen the situation now under discussion arose, he thoughtthat it would probably arise in an entirely different way fromanything that was at present envisaged.    He was, therefore,opposed to a discussion of these alternatives at the presenttime.     He hoped the Cabinet would rest content with the assurance he had given that he would make every possibleendeavour to ensure that vital decisions were considered bythe full Cabinet.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY referred to a suggestion which had been made in two quarters that hostilities mightbe started by an attempt to murder Lord Runciman or HerrHenlein.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had consulted the.      wy -authorities who dealt with these matters. They were oatifefiioathat the Czech Police protection for Lord Runciman waspolicemen to protect Lord Runciman. wouia have awkward political consequences. For the time beings therefore, it had beendecided not to despatch a police guard for Lord Runciman,but the, subject was being further investigated.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he wished to be sure that adequate and they were informed that the aespateh of British
Itarygelation ofiSituation*jrioussrence:  ,[net 15 (38)fusion 1)1   ;&apos;)i&quot;1THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR referred tothe need for an up to date appreciation of thesituation hy the Chiefs of Staff,THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was sometime since the Chiefs of Staff had prepared theirReport of last March on the implications of german aggression against Czechoslovakia0     He thought theyshould be asked to review the position in the lightof the most recent developments.     Thus supposingFrance to be&apos; at war with Germany;    what action wasGermany likely to take and what action could we takeagainst her?THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEBald that the Chiefs of Staff had recently preparedan appreciation relating to the situation, as itwould be in April, 1939.     He understood that theposition to-day was not substantially different.     he agreed, however, that it would be as well that theChiefs of Staff should review the position.     Hethought that could be done in a few days&apos; time.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thathe had re-read the Chiefs of Staff Report of the28th March (EVP. (36) 57).     This Report made it quite clear that, if the circumstances envisaged came topass, no action which the Army or the Navy could takewould prevent Germany from inflicting a decisivedefeat on Czechoslovakia.     There was nothing effectivewhich we could do except by means of a process ofattrition.     He thought that any question of a warning to be delivered by this country must march hand inhand with what we were in a position to do.     suppose that in a fortnight&apos;s time, Herr Hitler tried to seize a part of Czechoslovakia rapidly, what affective
action were we in a position to take?In the course of further discussion, it wasagreed that the Chiefs of Staff should be invited to review the position on the lines proposed.     It was clear thatsuch a review could only be carried out on the basis ofcertain definite assumptions, but, so far as the Militaryassumptions were concerned, these must be framed by theChiefs of Staff themselves,,THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that hethought the review should, if possible, give the positionboth as it is to-day and also as it would be next year if germany was allowed to carry out a coup in Czechoslovakiathis year and subsequently extended her influence in South-Eastern Europe; it was essential to compare the position under both hypotheses.It was agreed:That the Chiefs of Staff should be askedto prepare an up to date appreciation ofthe situation which would arise in theevent of immediate hostilities on thelines indicated above.
precautionary Discussion then turned on various military measures.precautions which might he taken to ensure a higher  -.degree of preparedness.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR referred to thetwo Meetings which had been held under the chairmanship of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence at whichvarious proposals had been submitted by the three service departments.     These proposals had been approved, but some of them required financial authority.      They hadbeen submitted to the Treasury Inter-Service Committee,but authority for certain items had been withheld.After further discussion it was agreed that theMinisters concerned would look into the points at issue,THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said thatin regard to any further meetings of representatives ofthe Defence Departments which he might arrange, he would ensure that a representative of the Treasury was invitedto attend.Discussion then turned to various measures inregard to passive defence and. the home position.   STHE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought that the position should be reviewed, and suggested certain steps inregard,-e. g., to the purchase of blankets and stretchers,which might be taken.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR also referred to certainproblems which awaited solution concerning the closing down of factories during air raids.      He v/as not sure whowas responsible for dealing with these problems.THE HOME SECRETARY said that there was a longseries of these problems, and he thought that they should(p be kept separate from the Chiefs of Staff Report.&apos;&apos;&apos;;-!,&apos;T&apos; -   s  -; &apos; &quot;&quot; &quot;:&apos;.       &apos; .     .       &quot;     1   .&apos; &apos;.   &apos;-&apos;   :-v-    : &apos;.v .&apos; &apos;&quot;&apos;: ::&apos;-\ -&apos;- - ;yv .i &apos; V &apos;     -   - -.\-V-&apos;-&apos; ; -V    -&apos; -!&apos;:&apos;     . - &apos; .-20-
After discussion it was agreed that Civil departments should he instructed to prepare a Note concerning any matters in regard to which they thought that some immediate action should he taken, and should submit it to theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence.      THE MINISTER FORCO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE undertook to see that immediate steps were taken to have these matters dealt with and tosubmit them for Ministerial decision where necessary atthe earliest possible opportunity.In this connection it was suggested that it wouldbe undesirable to set up new Committees for this purpose and that it was desirable to use the normal machinery sofar as possible.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that there &apos;were certain further naval steps which he thought could betaken without undue publicity, and he would propose tosubmit these proposals to the Prime Minister with a vie?/ to action being taken at once if the Prime Minister agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hoped the cabinet agreed with the action taken so far.    He suggested that another Meeting should be called as soon as any decision was necessary on a very vital issue.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat as soon as there had been time to study Herr Hitler&apos;sspeech it would be desirable to have a Meeting to considerthe position generally. For the present he thought that,while steps might be taken to get Departmental machinerygoing, it would be wiser to take no further overt action.
Reply to THE FOREIGN SECRETARY referred toSir Eric Phipps&apos;sletter of Sir Eric Phipps&apos;s letter of the 10th September.10th September.He had not yet had time to consult the ForeignOffice, but he thought that it might be desirableto obtain the approval of the Cabinet to thegeneral line which the reply should take.      Hesuggested that this shoiild be to the following effect:-&quot;While II. M. Government would neverallow the security of Prance to be threatened, they are unableto make precise statements of thecharacter of their future action,or the time at which it would betaken,  in circumstances that theycannot at present foresee.&quot;THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat he hoped that in drafting a reply on thismatter the Foreign Secretary would bear in mind thathe thought the tone of his discussion with the french ambassador on the 7th September was perhaps somewhatdiscouraging to the French,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed out that he had had two interviews with the French Ambassador on the7th September.      At the first interview he had given a considered view.    At the second,  a chance conversationhad taken placec    It was this second conversation whichhad somewhat excited the French, and he proposed toexplain the circumstances to them.     At the same time it was&apos; difficult to steer a line between being toodiscouraging and not encouraging enough to the French.
IMinisters1speakingengagements.CabinetfutureMeetings.After further discussion,  it was agreed that thegeneral line of the Foreign secretary reply toM. Bonnet&apos;s enquiry, in regard to which ho would consultfurther with the Prime Minister, must he neither to put the brake on the French nor yet to apply the accelerator.The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider a suggestion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that he mightinform the French that, in any eventp a certain amount&apos;of delay to enable consultation to take place with theDominions, would probably be necessaryeSeveral Ministers made reference to speakingengagements which they were due to fulfil in the nextfew days.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY suggested that,  in anyspeeches which they might make, Ministers might say something on the lines of what the Prime minister had said to the Press yesterday, namely, that thenegotiations had reached a stage at which no reasonwas seen why a settlement should not be arrived atwithout recourse to force,  and,  in our view, no justification was seen for recourse to force.In regard to meetings which would involveMinisters having to travel a long distance from Londonduring the next two or three days, the PRIME minister thought that such meetings could be cancelled on theground that in present circumstances the minister concerned could not be absent from London for thelength of time involved.    As regards future meetingsof the-Cabinet, it was not possible to reach animmediate decision.    It might be necessary to havea meeting on Tuesday, the 13th September, but hethought it more likely that the next meeting would beheld on Wednesday, the 14th September.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that it would he desirable that the Lord privy seal should proceed to Geneva, hut that he should holdhimself free to return at very short notice.      This wasagreed to.In conclusion, THE PRIME MINISTER read extracts from a note of a conversation which Sir Horace wilson had with Lord Brocket, who had just returned fromNuremberg.CONCLUSIONS.It was agreed -(l)    To take note of the statements made by the Prime Minister and secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in regard to the policy which,had been adopted for dealing With thesituation since the Meeting ofMinisters held on the 30th August,and to approve the action taken togive effect thereto.(2)    That further decisions on policy should be postponed until afterHerr Hitler&apos;s speech at Nuremberg this evening.(3)-  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should reply toM.

No decision on vitalissues of policy would be taken until this further meeting of the Cabinet hadbeen held.(5) ; To approve the&apos; reply which the PrimeMinister proposed to send to Mr. Attleein regard to the summoning of Parliament^namely, that in present circumstances itwas undesirable to summon Parliament,but that a situation might arise in whichthis course would be necessary..

I asked the Ambassador whether, by his suggestionthat, it was important to remove any ambiguity, M.

I said that His Majesty&apos;s Government would give full weight to Mo Bonnet1s suggestion, which was one thatwe had always before our minds.    As I had more than oncesaid to M.

Making full allowance for the wider issues that public opinion might recognise to be involved in anyattack on Czechoslovakia, I thought that there was a distinction to be drawn.    I did not think-&apos;that british public opinion, although it might change as thesituation developed, would be willing to contemplatebeing involved in war on direcc account of Czechoslovakia.While this was certainly true, I thought it was also,probable that If Prance was obliged to act in&apos;dischargeof her obligations, British public opinion would realise that we could not allow Prance to be in trouble, withoutwishing to do our best to help her.    This distinctionmeant that, although Great Britain might feel obligedto support France in a conflict, if only because it would
recognise that British interests were involved in any threat to French security, it did not meaii that we shouldbe willing automatically to find ourselves at war wlth &apos;Germany, because France might be involved in discharge of obligations which Great Britain did not share, and whicha large section of British opinion had always disliked.
3&apos;t)APPENDIX   II.Copy, of letter from the British ambassador at. Paris to the Secretary of State for&quot; Foreign Affairs,- BRITISH EMBASSY,PARiS.PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL.10th beptember, 1938.My dear Secretary of State,Bonnet said to me in the course of our conversationthis morning that he wished to put a question to me not tothe Ambassador but to the friend.Supposing the Germans attacked Czechoslovakia and france mobilised, as she at once would.     Supposing Francethen turned to Great Britain and said &quot;We are going to march;will you march with us&quot;&apos;rWhat would our answer beV   Bonnet said it wastremendously important to know, and if the question were put it would be tremendously important that the answer shouldbe immediate and quite plain, one way or the other.I replied, speaking personally, that not only could not give an answer to this hypothetical question, but thatI really did not believe that His Majesty&apos;s Government couldeither.So much I said, depended upon the nature of theGerman &quot;aggression&quot;, for instance.      Supposing, for the sake of argument, that the Czech police or crowd lost their headsand killed several Sudeten Germans, and that Hitler, in response to an appeal for help, marched in.     Would thatConstitute an act of aggression that would warrant an affirmative reply by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the above-mentioned question by France&apos;?     One of many other shadings
of &quot;aggression&quot;might take place and I could not conceive ofa cut and dried reply that would apply to all of them.Bonnet begged me to treat all this as very private;in fact he indicated that he did not wish his question to meto be officially recorded.     Hence this private letter, whichI told him I would write.In the course of our conversation I indicated thatthe positions of our two countries were not quite similar.Prance was bound by a definite pact, whereas we were not.To this Bonnet objected that the moment had passed for legalsubtleties.    It was vital for our two countries to acttogether in the matter, which might be one of life or death.Bonnet repeated what he had said to me so often,viz:    that the French Government will adopt any plan of settlement suggested by Lord Runciman or by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.My impression is that Bonnet, perhaps more thanDaladier, and certainly much more than Mandel, Reynaud andCo., is desperately anxious for a possible way out of this&quot;impasse&quot; without being obliged to fight.I of course always indicate that, although LordRunciman may produce a plan as a last card, it would be greatly preferable that that last card should not have tobe played.     The ideal solution remains one agreed upon bythe Sudeten and the Czechoslovaks.Yours very sincerely,(Signed)     ERIC PHIPPS.The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Halifax, K.G.,G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.,    etc.
