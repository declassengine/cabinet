THE MUNICH THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that heCONFERENCE.---        thought the present occasion justified a departureprime from the normal procedure at Cabinet Meetings,  and minister&apos;sReport, that, before the Prime Minister spoke, he should express, on behalf of the whole Cabinet, their(previous reference? profound admiration for the unparalleled effortsCabinet46(38).)     the Prime Minister had made and for the success that hefTR V?^)&apos;. ha(* achieve(a-s He would also like to say how proudthey were to be associated with the Prime minister as his colleagues at this time.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was deeply-grateful for what the Chancellor of the exchequer had said, and for the support and help which hehad received from his colleagues throughout the crisis.    He appreciated that the journeys he had undertaken might easily haVe failed to achievesatisfactory results.    As things had turned out, he felt that we could now safely regard the crisis asended.He thought that it was right that his colleagues should meet at once and hear the results of theConference at Munich.The discussions had begun after lunch onThursday and had continued, with occasional intervals,throughout the night until after 1 a.rric on Fridaymorning.    The length of the proceedings was largely due to the inefficiency of the arrangements for theConference made hy the Germans..    When the time had come to sign the final Agreements,  it had been foundthat the inkpot into which Herr Hitler dipped-his penwas emptyiAt the outset of the Conference thePrime Minister had suggested that a Czechrepresentative should be sent for, but it hadbeen represented that the matter was too urgent
to permit of the delay, that this course would involve.The Prime Minister mentioned that Signer mussolini had arranged for his reception in Rome on his return from the Conference to take place on Friday.     This hadfixed the latest hour at which Signor Mussolini couldleave Munich.The Prime Minister said that he had done his bestfor Czechoslovakia in the absence of a Czech government representative, and he thought that the arrangementssecured could, taken as a whole, be regarded as satisfactory.The simplest method of explaining the arrangement-was, he thought, to set out the. main differences betweenthe Agreement signed at Munich and the plan put forward by Herr Hitler at Godesberg.First, the Godosberg Memorandum,though cast inthe form of proposals, was in fact an ultimatum, with atime-limit of six days.The Munich Agreement, which had now been accepted bythe Czechoslovak Government, reverted, though not inexpress terms, to the Anglo-French plan (which was referred to in the. preamble).     The agreement laid down the conditions for the application - on the responsibilityof the Four Powers and under international supervision -of the main principle of that plan.Second,     under the Munich Agreement, the evacuation of the territory to be occupied by the German militaryforces and its occupation by those forces would becarried out in five clearly defined stages between 1st October and 10th October (Article 4), instead of having to be completed in one operation by 1stOctober,.
Third;    the line up to which the German troops would enter into occupation was no longer the linedrawn by Herr Hitler as laid down in the map attachedto the Godesberg Memorandum, but was a line to befixed by an International Commission on which both germany and Czechoslovakia would be represented.(Article 4.)Fourth:   under the Godesberg Memorandum, the a reason the Czech side of the Hitler line which were tobe subjected to plebiscite were laid down by germany in the map, while those on the German side of that linewere left undefined.Under the Munich Agreement, all plebisciteareas would be defined by the International Commission(Article 5).    The &quot;green areas&quot;, therefore, like theHitler line itself, disappeared.     The criterion whichthe International Commission was to apply was to bethe &quot;predominantly German character&quot; of the areas concerned, the interpretation of which was left to theCommission.    The Hitler line had taken in some ares which were certainly not of a &quot;predominantly Germancharacter&quot;.Fifth:    the Godesberg Memorandum provided for theoccupation of plebiscite areas by German and Czech forces(as the case might be) up to the plebiscite, and fortheir evacuation by those forces during the plebisciteUnder the Munich Agreement, the plebiscite areas were to be occupied at once by an international force.Sixth;    the Munich Arrangement, by stating (Article 5)that the plebiscite was to be based on the conditionsof the Saar plebiscite, indicated that the vote was tobe taken by small administrative areas such as communes.
The Godesberg Memorandum did not indicate on what kind of areas the vote would he based, and gave rise to fears on the Czech side that thepossible insistence by Germany on large areas mightwork to the disadvantage of Czechoslovakia.Seventh:    The Czech Government, while boundunder the Munich Arrangement to carry out theevacuation of the territories without damaging&quot;existing installations&quot; (Article 2), was not placed under the oppressive and humiliating conditions ofthe appendix to the Godesberg Memorandum, which even provided that no foodstuffs, goods, cattle orraw materials were to be removed.Under the Munich agreement, the conditionsof evacuation (Article 3) were to be laid down indetail by the International Commission.      Under theGodesberg Memorandum the detailed arrangements forthe evacuation were to be settled between Germans andCzechs alone.Eighth:    Unlike the Godesberg Memorandum, theMunich Agreement contained provisions in regard to(a)    right of option (Article 7) and (b) facilitatingtransfer of population (Article 7).Ninth:     The Prime Minister explained that provision was made in the Supplementary Declarationfor all other questions in regard to transfer of territory not dealt with in the main Memorandum tocome under the purview&apos;of the international commission.       The reason why this provision had
been inserted in a Supplementary Agreement was thatwhen the time came to sign the main Agreement it was found that Herr Ribbentrop had excised a provision tothis effect which had been drafted.     Herr Ribbentrophad said that the omission of a clause to this effect would make no difference, as the matter would in anycase be dealt with by the International Commission.The Prime Minister had taken the view that thefunctions of the International Commission would be governed by their terms of reference, and that it wasnecessary to have it specifically laid down that questionswhich might arise out of transfer of territory should beconsidered as coming within the terms of reference of theInternational Commission.     The Prime Minister had thoughtit well worth while to secure this further clause.As regards guarantees, provision was made inan Annex to the Munich Agreement for a guarantee of czechoslovakia against unprovoked aggression.     Theguarantee of Prance and Great Britain entered intooperation at once, while the guarantee of Germany andItaly came into operation after the Hungarian and polish minorities questions had been settled.This question of guarantees had been a difficult one to deal with.     The Prime Minister saidthat he had stated that he could not deal with it without an opportunity of further consultation with hisGovernment.     Signor Mussolini had wanted to saythat the Polish and Hungarian minorities questions should be settled on the same principle,as those applied to the Sudeten Germans
and within a period of one month;    and that in themeantime Italy and Germany would guarantee Czechoslovakia.The Prime Minister said that this suggestion had ,not appealed to him.      In the first place, the phrase in regard tothe application of the same principles as those applied in the case of the Sudeten-Germans had seemed to himto he rather f^ar-reaching.     ^gain, he v/as not certainin what terms he wanted Germany and Italy included inthe guarantee.     In the end an arrangement had beenreached which involved no further commitments in regardto our guarantee than v/e had already agreed to.Finally, the Four Powers had signed a declaration that if the problems of the Polish and Hungarian minorities^in Czechoslovakia v/ere not settled within three months byagreement between the respective Governments, anotherFour-Power Meeting would be held to consider them-The Prime Minister said that these v/ere themain points of difference between the Munich Agree-development and the Godesberg Memorandum.     He thought, it-could fairly be said that the Munich Agreement v/asa vast improvement, and that it represented an orderly v/ay of carrying out the Franco-british proposals.     He thought it v/as a triumph fordiplomacy    that representatives of the Four Pov/ersconcerned should have met and reached a peaceful settlement of the matter.
A number of the Prime Minister&apos;s-collea^ueBthen put questions to him in regard to detailedpoints arising out of the terms of the MunichAgreement.      The Prime Minister undertook to circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandum setting outin detail the points of difference between the MunichAgreement and the Godesberg Memorandum as early aspossible.The Prime Minister was then asked about theMemorandum which he and Herr Hitler had signed that morning, which he read out to his colleagues (copy is appended as an Annex to these Minutes).The Prime Minister added that he had had some further conversation that morning with Herr Hitleron the following subjects: limitation of armaments,the position in Spain, and South Eastern Europe.The question of Colonies had not been referred toin this discussion.     The Prime Minister undertook that he would take an early opportunity of informinghis colleagues of the upshot of this conversation,either by making a statement at an early meeting ofthe Cabinet, or by circulating a written record.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY saidthat after the detailed explanation given bythe Prime Minister, he recognised that the
differences &quot;between the Godesberg Memorandum and theMunich Agreement were much greater than he had previously recognised.     Nevertheless, he thought thatit was right that he should say that he still felt aconsiderable uneasiness in regard to the position.He was afraid that we might get into the position inwhich we were drawn into making further concessions to herr Hitler.     He agreed, however, with the view whichwas put forward by several of his colleagues that therehad not been time to study the terms of the MunichAgreement in detail, and he said that he was preparedto defer a final statement of his position until therehad been a further opportunity to consider theAgreement.     He added, however, that he had come to themeeting prepared to resign, and that he still felt it was his duty to offer the Prime Minister his resignation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought that matters arising out of the First Lord&apos;s statement should be discussed between him and the First Lord.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he felt sure that the Cabinet would wish to associate themselves with what the Chancellor of theExchequer had said in regard to the Prime Minister&apos;sachievement in making this Agreement.     He thought itwould be desirable that the Cabinet should have anopportunity to reflect on the many important questionswhich were raised as a result of the Prime Minister&apos;visit to Munich, and that at a later date there should bean opportunity for further discussion on these matters.This course was agreed to.      /THE MINISTER POR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEeaid that a meeting of Ministers had been held that
morning to consider what action should be taken to\suspend or cancel measures taken to meet theemergencynThe general conclusion reached had been to recommend a standstill order for the timebeing, but not an extension of the precautionsalready in force.The Minister for Co-ordination of defence said that while the position had, he thought,been adequately dealt with for the time beingby the meeting held that morning, it would clearly be necessary to reach further decisions in the near future.    He proposed that a further meeting of the Ministers concerned should be heldon Monday at 12 noon to consider detailed steps necessary in the light of any general guidancewhich the Prime Minister might give in regard to thematter when he had had time to consider the positiongenerally.This course was agreed to.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.1st October, 1938.
-A H N E X.Text of Joint Declaration signed by thePrime Minister and Herr Hitler   at Munichon Friday,  30th September, 19 38.We, the German Fuehrer and Chancellor, and theBritish Prime Minister, have had a further meeting to-day,and are agreed in recognising that the question of Anglo-German relations is of the first importance for the twocountries and for Europe,We regard the Agreement signed last night and theAnglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire ofour two peoples never to go to war with one another again.We are resolved that the method of consultationshall be the method adopted to deal with any other questions that may concern our two countries, and we are determined to continue our efforts to remove possible sources of difference, and thus to contribute to assure the peace of Europe.
