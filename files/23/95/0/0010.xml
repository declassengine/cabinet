THE INTER-BTIOMLSITUATION,Sir EoraceWilson&apos;visit to herr hitler.(previous reference:Cabinet45(38)Conclusion 1)Attitude ofthe Dominions.(previous reference:Cabinet 45(38)Conclusion 7).See No. 96fromAustralia./. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had thought it right to call the Cabinet together to hear about the developments in the situation since they last met, andalso to hear from Sir Horace Wilson an account of hisinterviews with Herr Hitler.There were a number of other recent developments of which the Cabinet should be aware.The Prime Minister read out telegram No. 534 from our Ambassador at Berlin, recording his view of thesituation.    The Ambassador took the view that, unless atthis eleventh hour, we advised Czechoslovakia to makethe best terms she could, with Berlin, we should beexposing Czechoslovakia to the fate of Abyssinia.The Prime Minister also reported that that afternoon he had seen the Military Attache from Berlin,who had just returned from a visit to Czechoslovakia.He had found the moral of the country very poor and had formed the impression that they would offer a feebleresistance.    Their materiel arrangements also were not ready.More disturbing than this was the fact that theDominions were far from happy about the situation.   Heread a telegram from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealthof Australia, of which the most important point was that,the transfer of the Sudeten areas to Germany having beenagreed upon in principle, the precise method of giving effect to that decision was not a matter of sufficient importance to warrant a dispute leading to war.
He had. also received that morning an aide-memoire fromMr. te Water.    General Hertzog had asked Mr.  te Water toinform the Prime Minister that he and his colleagues feltthat Herr Hitler&apos;s Memorandum should he accepted.The Prime Minister added that the High commissioners of the Dominions had all visited Downing Street that afternoon and had all represented that in their viewfurther pressure should he put upon the czechoslovak government to accept Herr Hitler&apos;s terms.    The situationvis-a-vis the Dominions was thus very delicate.    He asked the Colonial Secretary to explain the position more fully.THE SECRETARY OP THE STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat during the last three or four days the high commissioners had been expressing the view indicated hythe&apos; Prime Minister with increasing insistence.    that afternoon they had insisted that he should lay theirviews before the Prime Minister.    His own view was thatif we were involved in war, all the Dominions would sooner or later come in with us, hut it was clear that theywould come in only^aftcr making a ntmnbor of r eo^jft^atimnQi.No doubt it was difficult to he quite certainwhat view was taken hy public opinion in the Dominionsgenerally.    It was clear that Mr. Lyons was correctlyrepresenting the views of his Governments but he hadreceived a telegram from the Acting High Commissioner inAustraliat.   who thought that Mr. Lyons under-estimated the strength of feeling in Australia against acceptance of
Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals.    There could he no douhts how-ever-, that the High Commissioners were unanimous in theview that we should urge Czechoslovakia to accept HerrHitler4s proposals.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was our clear duty to lay before the Czechoslovak Government the information which we had received as to Germany&apos;s intentions ifHerr Hitler&apos;s proposals were not accepted.    This had beendone in telegram No. 367 to Prague, which had been sentoff. that afternoon with his approval.He then asked Sir Horace Wilson to give an accountof his interviews with Herr Hitler.SIR HORACE WILSON s aid that he had had twointerviews.    The first had taken place on Monday at p.m. and had lasted until nearly 6 p.m.    Herr Hitler had,been due to deliver his speech at 8 p.m. and had been ina considerable state of excitement.    When the second paragraph of the Prime Minister&apos;s letter of the 26thSeptember (which informed the Chancellor that the czechoslovak Government had rejected Herr Hitler sproposals) had been reached, he had risen from his chairand it was only with difficulty that he could be persuaded to resume his seat.    After a time the discussion had been continuedj. and Herr Hitler then stated that hecould not depart from the terms of his Memorandum.   Hesaid that he had waited many weeks for Dr. Benes totake some action to show that he meant business, but hecould wait no longer.    He must now take action, and theareas must be handed over to Germany by the 1st October.Sir Horace said he had felt that it was useless tocontinue the discussion while herr Hitler was in that
mood;    still less would it have &quot;been appropriate topresent to him the special oral message which he had been authorised to give, and which herr Hitler might have regarded as an ultimatum, as this might have made thecharacter of his speech on Monday night more inflammatory.He had therefore concluded the interview and had asked if he might resume the talk on the next day.The second interview had accordingly taken place at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 27th September.    Sir Horace wilson had referred to Herr Hitler&apos;s speech, and in particular to the sentences in it which had been inserted as theresult of what the Prime Minister had said to thePuhrer at Godesberg.    For example, Herr Hitler had publicly declared that when the Sudeten-German question had been settled, he had no further territorial claims in Europe.    Sir Horace said that he had then spoken onthe lines of the statement made by the Prime Minister tothe Press early that morning, and had asked whether, inthe light of that statement, the Puhrer had any messagefor the Prime Minister, who was willing to consider further efforts at mediation.    Herr Hitler had repliedthat we ought to put further pressure on Czechoslovakia,Herr Hitler had stated plainly that in his view therewere two alternatives, and two only:    first, acceptanceof the terms of his Memorandum,    second, that the german troops would over-run Czechoslovakia.    Sir Horace had replied that there was no course open to him but toreport what Herr Hitler had said to the Prime Minister,who would, no doubt, inform the Czechoslovak Government,upon whom would rest the responsibility for a finaldecision.
2p !&apos;0 sir Horace Wilson said that he had then delivered the special oral messages     He had led up to the message carefully by emphasisingthai; he had been instructed to present thecourse of events as His Majesty&apos;s Government foresaw&apos;them if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.   Hehad then given the precise terms of the message,very slowly.Sir Horace said that Herr Hitler hadtaken the message very quietly and had begun toput questions.     Herr Hitler had then said that,first of all, he must tell Sir Horace that hehad no intention of attacking Prance.   /this had been repeated by Herr von Ribbentrop, whohad made no other contribution to the conversation^Herr Hitler then said that if the gist of the message delivered by Sir Horace was that if he(Herr Hitler) carried out his policy in regardto Czechoslovakia, Prance and England wouldattack Germany.^    Sir Horace had then repeated the precise way in which he-had led up to ft Iraformula, and had again explained %terir-dr^-re^eeefit*ed&apos;the sequence of events^     Herr Hitler had repeated that he had no intention whatsoever of attackingPrancea     He was, however, prepared for alleventualitieso     He mentioned the immense sums which had been spent on the Western fortifications-tions, and had said that we must understand thatit was Czechoslovakia who was responsible forthis state of affairs.     This had been theprelude to the usual tirade against Czechoslovakia.
As they walked away from the meetingHerr Hitler had asked him to convey to thePrime Minister and His Majesty&apos;s Government histhanks for the efforts they had made to avoid a conflict.     He could not helieve that Germanyand England could find themselves at war, andhe urged the.Prime Minister to do all he could to induce Czechoslovakia to accept his Memorandum.Sir Horace said that it was clear thatthey had to deal with a firm conviction onHerr Hitler&apos;s part that Dr. Benes was a., twister,who would never implement his promises hutv/ould continue to prevaricate.     He thought that dr. Bones would refuse his torus bccauso hothought Franco and Groat Britain would support him, and he could not understand why wewere under his influence.     Herr Hitler, Herrvon Ribbentrop and Field-Marshal Goering had allmade play with messages from M. Masaryk to dr. Benes, which they admitted to have tapped.These messages urged Dr. Benes to stand firm, and said that there was no need for them to eedeterritory since they had got France and GreatBritain exactly where they--wantsd.     All thisconfirmed Herr Hitler in his view that Dr. Beneswas procrastinating, and he asked why we allowedour policy to he settled as the result of theinfluence of Russia, exerted at Paris and Prague.He had repeated that at this hour there were only two alternatives, and he had asked us to do all we could to find a settlement and avoid war.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR AIR asked .whether Herr Hitler had indicated that anythingwas likely to result from the Prime Minister*soffer that we would -undertake to see thatCzechoslovakia carried out the terms of the franco-British proposals?SIR HORACE WILSON replied that in herr hitler&apos;s view this came too late.     He thoughtthat Herr Hitler doubted whether we should beable to take effective steps to ensure that dr. Benes fulfilled his promises;Assuming that Czechoslovakia would not accept Herr Hitler&apos;s Memorandum, and would feel Ittoo humiliating, in particular,&apos; to accept theterms set out in paragraph 2,&apos; the only questionwhich remained was whether there was any otheraourse which would avoid the complete overwhelmingof Czechoslovakia by Germany.     Herr Hitler,in his speech the previous evening, had intendedto make it clear that he would be content tosettle the Sudeten German question on the basis ofthe cession of areas to be defined by an Inter-national Commission,-     He adhered to the offer of a plebiscite, and to the withdrawal of theGerman troops while the plebiscite was beingcarried out.     He also agreed to the proposalput before him by Sir Frederick Maurice thatBritish ex-ServIce men should be employed to assist in keeping order during the plebiscite period.
Assuming that Czechoslovakia would not accept Herr Hitler*s terms, the only plan whichcould prevent the country from being over-runwould he for the Czechoslovak Government towithdraw their troops from the red areas and allow Germany to occupy them without loss of life.     When this had been done, the determina-tion of the areas to be ceded permanently -could he carried out by an International Commis-sion, with a plebiscite.     If this ha-ppened, the czechoslovak Government would have the benefitof Herr Hitler&apos;s    public declaration thatSudeten German territory represented the last of his territorial aims in Europe,     They wouldalso have the Franco-British guarantee, asproposed in the joint Franco-British Memorandum,If the Czechoslovak Government v/ould agreeto this course on the ensuing day the GermanGovernment v/ould co-operate with them.    jnjustification of this course the czechoslovak government could urge that they had acted inthe interests of European peace and to avoidbloodshed.      If they did not adopt this course it was clear that the german occupation of Czechoslovakia would almost certainly be very much more extensive.
In reply to a question from the Secretary ofState for Air, SIR HORACE WILSON said that he thoughtthat if Czechoslovakia offered resistance the german troops would not stop at the language line.THE MINISTER POR CO-ORDINATION OP defence pointed out that this was consistent with information given them by General Gamelin as to the concentration of German troops north and south of the bottle-neclc of czechoslovakia.THE PRIME MINISTER added that the latest information was that Poland would side with Germany. Thiswould be consistent with the fact that they had rejected the proposals made to them by M. Benes.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that thefacts presented all tended to one conclusion.     There were,however, other facts which tended the other way.     be referred to President Rooseveltfs message and to thelatest reports from our Ambassador in Paris, which showed a much firmer spirit in Prance than previously.As regards the Dominions, he did not think thattoo much importance should be attached to the opinions expressed at this moment by their High Commissioners.Perhaps the really extraordinary thing was that theDominions should ever take part in a European war.    after all, our position in regard to the co-operation of theDominions was more favourable than it had been in 1914,when there had been a Revolution in South Africa.^ He thoughtthat if we waited until there was complete unanimity withthe Dominion Governments on issues of peace and war inEurope, that would mean that we should never go to war.
The First Lord rather regretted that the specialmessages which Sir Horace Wilson had been authorised to deliver, had not been delivered before Herr Hitler had made his speech.      Public opinion in Germany still doubted whether we should come into the war and he thought thatwe had, in fact, given them some justification for thisdoubt.The First Lord here referred to the semi-official statement issued in the press on the preceding evening.The proposal before the Cabinet that evening reallyamounted to a proposal that,  at the eleventh hour, after having seen the French Ministers yesterday, we should urgeCzechoslovakia to a policy of surrender.    It was no useurging that course on Czechoslovakia unless we also toldher that, unless she adopted it, we should refuse to cometo her help.      He thought that this course was quitexxnjustified and he could not be associated with it.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that atthe time when the reply of the Czechoslovak Government to herr Hitler&apos;s Memorandum had been received, he had thoughtthat there had been no opportunity to place beforeCzechoslovakia a statement of the probable consequences if she rejected the Memorandum.      He thought that we were entitled, when laying proposals before Czechoslovakia,  togive a clear statement of the probable consequences oftheir decision.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE asked for some further explanation of the proposal now before the Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Sir Horace Wilson,having returned from delivering the Prime Minister1s message to Herr Hitler, had reached the conclusion that it was certain that Herr Hitler would attack Czechoslovakia, unlesseither his terms were accepted or the further suggestion
fa / 1now put forward was acted upon.     If Czechoslovakiaopposed Germany&apos;s attack by force of arms, it was clearthat German troops would not stop at the red line, but would overrun the whole country until they had reachedwhat Herr Hitler had described as a &quot;strategic frontier&quot;,namely a line across the bottle-neck of Czechoslovakia.If, however, Czechoslovakia made the announcement now suggested that, while not accepting Herr Hitler&apos;s terms,they would not resist the march of his troops up to thered line,  then it would be possible to avoid bloodshed.He did not propose that we should advise Czechoslovakiato take this course, but merely that we should put thissuggestion before them.This suggestion had been considered by the PrimeMinister and the three colleagues who were in constantconsultation with him.     They had thoxight that this offer was perhaps the last opportunity for avoiding war, and that itwould not be right that they should decide against its adoption, without putting all the facts before the cabinet and leaving them to judge for themselves.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE asked in what respect this proposal differed from acceptance ofthe German Government&apos;s proposals.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that if the czechoslovak Government, having rejected Herr Hitler&apos;terms, left the matter there, the German advance intoCzechoslovakia would take place on the basis of the Czechrefusal of the German terms, and.the Germans would not stopat the red line.      If, however, Czechoslovakia let it be known that she was prepared to withdraw her troops behind the red line,  then Germany would be prepared to stop at the
red line.     The suggestion now under consideration amountedto tacit acceptance of Herr Hitler&apos;s Memorandum.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, before dealing withthe present suggestion, he would like to inform hiscolleagues of one or two matters.First, the French Embassy had informed him thatM. Bonnet thought that there were points in Herr Hitler&apos;sspeech which were promising, and which should be taken up and discussed with Germany.     He mentioned his references to the International Commission.     M. Bonnet had alsoenquired whether some compromise could not be put forwardwhich would enable the evacuation by Czechoslovakian troops,of the districts   which it had been agreed should he cededto Germany, to proceed swiftly, and for a measure ofoccupation by German troops to take place rapidly.The Foreign Secretary said that he had already been working out an accelerated time-table and, after receivingthis suggestion of the French ^Government, he had despatchedtelegrams, putting forward tentative suggestions for sucha scheme to Prague (No.  368), Berlin (No. 428) and Paris.(No.  338).The Foreign Secretary then read extracts from these telegrams -The Foreign Secretary said that he had neverentertained much hope that this scheme would be accepted,but there could be no harm in making this further effort tosecure a peaceful settlement.     This telegram had been drafted and despatched before he had seen Sir Horace Wilson&apos;sreport on his visit to Herr Hitler.
The Foreign Secretary then turned to the suggestion which had been explained, by the Prime Minister andSir Horace Wilson,  and the draft telegram in whichthe suggestion had been embodied.,       For his parthe would feel great difficult^ in sending the draft telegram. In the first place, certain decisions had been reached with the French on Sunday, and wecould not depart from those decisions without consult-ing with the French Government.      The suggestionamounted to complete capitulation to Germany.     he realised that, if we did not adopt this suggestion,the consequences to Czechoslovakia and to many other people might well be very grievous.       nevertheless he did not feel that it was right to do more than toplace before M. Benes an objective account of the position.That had already been done (soe telegram^567 to Prague). &apos;Further, the Foreign Secretary said that he feltthet there was a much greater difference between the franco-British proposals and the German Memorandum thanone of time, method and degree.      We could not press the Czechoslovakian Government to do what we believed to be wrong.       Nor did. he think that the presentsuggestion was one which would be ..accepted by the Houseof Commons.      Finally, we could not adopt this suggestionunless we assured Czechoslovakia that the Germans wouldstop at the red line, and he would feel some difficultyin giving such an assurance,The Foreign Secretary therefore felt that therewas no alternative but to tell Czechoslovakia thatthey must be responsible for making their.own decision.We should make, however, pur co-operation with the french as close as possible, and. -in consultation w.th them3udge what action we ought to take..-13-
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Foreign secretary had given powerful and perhaps convincing reasons againstthe adoption of his suggestion..     If that was the general view of his colleagues, he was prepared to leave it atthat.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he was ofthe same view as the Foreign Secretary.     He also pointedout that in telegram 367 to Prague we had stated that wecould not take the responsibility of advising the PragueGovernment.     This alone would make it very difficult forus to press on the Czechoslovak Government the adoptionof the new suggestion.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE expressed somesurprise that telegram No. 488 to Berlin, referred toby the Foreign Secretary, which suggested the immediateoccupation of Egerland by Germany, should have been dispatched without consultation with the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thata fortnight ago M. Hodza had suggested the cession ofEgerland.       The suggestion had also been dealt with inconsultation with the French Ambassador, who had concurred in it.     Egerland was outside the fortifications, and90 per cent, of the inhabitants were Germans.THE LORD CHANCELLOR asked whether the most recent events had been communicated to the French Government.THE PRIME MINISTER said this had been done, butthere had been no time to ascertain what effect this had had on the French Government1s attitude.THE CABINET agreed that the proposal to telegraph to Prague, putting forward the suggestion thatthe German troops should be allowed to advanceup to the red line Without resistance shouldnot be proceeded with.
uerr Hitler&apos;sIreply to theIprime Minister&apos;sletter of 26thlsepten*er.prime Minister&apos;sjspeech on 28thkept ember.THE PRIME MINISTER read out Herr Hitler&apos;reply to his letter of the 26th September, whichhad just been received ^Telegram 545 fromBerlin7.     It was felt that the letter mightbe found on examination to afford some groundon which a further proposal for a peaceful settlement could he based.     It was thought,however, that the letter, which was obviouslyvery carefully drafted, would require examinationbefore any final conclusion could be expressedupon it.2.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that his broadcastthat evening had been couched in rather general terms.     In his speech in the House of commons on Wednesday, it would he necessary for him togo further.     He thought that it would be necessarythat he should inform the House of Commons ofthe terms of the special message which he had authorised Sir Horace Wilson to give to herr hitler.     He did not, however, propose to commit himself to any statement to the effect that,if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, we should atonce go to war with Germany.There was general agreement expressed withthe view that the Prime Minister should base himself on the position that, if in fulfilment of her obligations to Czechoslovakia the forces of france  became engaged in active hostilitiesagainst Germany, we should feel obliged tosupport them.
In the course of further discussion it wassuggested that the Prime Minister&apos;s speech might hebased on the theme that he was working for peace upto the last possible moment, and that on that accountit was necessary that he should adopt an impartialattitude in regard to the particular matters in dispute.It was thought that this attitude would make for national unity0ILISATIOIT 3,      THE PRIME MINISTER announced that at the meetingTHE NAVY.held that afternoon, he had authorised the First lord to proceed with the mobilisation of the Navy,     Theiiecessary Order-in-Council would be made early onWednesday morning.     It was explained that this measuredid not involve general mobilisation of the Army or air Force, or the institution of the PrecautionaryStage.TUGAL, 4.      THE FOREIGN SECRETARY informed his colleagues that /? ^52)Z4-   General Franco had approached the Portuguese Governmentand proposed a pact of non-aggression.     He had informed the Portuguese Government, who had invitedhis views, that he thought that they would be well advised to make this pact06, Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.27th September, 1938,
A P P E N D I X.Draft Telegram to Prague,,Most Imme dj a t e.Telep&apos;ram No0 0.0*9*0000000Please deliver following additional message from Prime Minister to Dr0 Benes,In the light of the considerations set outin my earlier message, it seems to us that itwould he wise for you to consider the withdrawalof your troops from the areas to he occupied, inthis way leaving the German forces to effect abloodless occupation.     Subsequent developmentswould, of course, be governed by the arrangementscontemplated for the taking of a plebiscite under theInternational Commission, and you will have notedHitler&apos;s acceptance of the offer of the british legion to maintain order in the doubtful districts.2. Hitler&apos;s speech last night is a public con-firaiation of the undertaking he gave to the PrimeMinister at Berchtesgaden, namely, that he has nofurther territorial aims in Europe.     Apart from thisyou have the undertaking as to an internationalguarantee set forth in paragraph 6 of the joint messagetransmitted to you on the 18th (?19) September onbehalf of the Prench and the British Governments.3.       . If you should decide that this is in all thecircumstances a prudent course to adopt, it would be advisable for you to inform the German Government ofyour intention at the earliest possible moment andin any case before to-morrow afternoon.     No doubt
in any public announcement that was made you would say you had decided upon this action in order toavoid bloodshed and in the interests of European peace.4. We should be prepared, should you desire it,to make representations to the German Governmentwith a view to ensuring their co-operation in any detailed arrangements which you would find itnecessary to make.
