THE War Cabinet had a discussion on the future operationsExpeditionary 0f tue Egyptian Expeditionary Force, arising out of telegraphicForce, communications which had passed between  the  Chief of  theImperial General Staff and the General Officer Commanding-in-Obief, dated the 31st March and the 1st April, 1917.In the course of the discussion great stress was laid on the moral and political advantages to be expected from an advance inPalestine, and particularly from the occupation of Jerusalem, which,it was pointed out, would be hailed with the utmost satisfaction inall parts of the country. From this point of view a success inPalestine would have a very considerable importance quite apartfrom its purely military aspects. There was every probability thatin the course of the next few months there would be a veryconsiderable increase in the strain on the people of this countrydue to the War, and it was of the first importance that there shouldbe military successes to counteract the depressing influences of a difficult economic situation. Now here did success appear easier torealise than against Turkey. Consequently, the War Cabinet feltthat this was an operation in which we ought to take no risks. Itwas suggested that some of Sir Archibald Murray&apos;s communicationstended to show that in his appreciation of the purely military andstrategical aspects of the War he had rather lost sight of the moral[1365-111] .
importance of a victory such, as he might reasonably hope to achievein Palestine and Syria.The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief having laid stress on the difficulty of maintaining his lines of communication, which^prevented his force advancing any considerable distance in front ofrailhead, the War Cabinet examined the possibilities of supple-menting land by sea communications. &apos;lhe Chief of the War staff pointed out that there was no harbour on the Syrian coast south ofAyas in the Gulf of Iskandrun suitable for landing any considerable quantities of stores. Jaffa, the most southerly port on the Syriancoast, was, he said, merely an open anchorage entirely unprotectedagainst submarines, where stores had to be landed in surf boats. IfJaffa were occupied by a British Army it was possible that amaximum of a few hundred tons a day might be landed there, but even this operation would he liable to interruption both by bad weather and by submarines. Haifa would be a better port thanJaffa, but until it had been occupied f rom the land side it could notbe utilised for disembarkation purposes, owing to the facilities ofdefence offered by Mount Carmel, from which the port wascommanded.   At Beirut there was a small enclosed harbour.After a discussion, in the course of which the Chief of theImperial General Staff read the telegrams which had passed between general Sir Archibald Murray and himself, the War cabinet decided That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should inform theGeneral Officer Commanding the Egyptian ExpeditionaryEorce that they are very anxious to exploit the successesalready achieved to the utmost possible extent, and to capture Jerusalem; that he should ask Sir ArchibaldMurray to state definitely whether he intended to advancealong the route of the existing Turkish railway direct onJerusalem, or to proceed by the coast route to Jaffa, or to utilise both routes; and that he should invite Sir ArchibaldMurray to give a full estimate of his requirements in men,guns, and transport, in order to ensure the occupation of jerusalem.The PoliticalMission with theEgyptianExpeditionaryForce.2. The War Cabinet decided That before his departure to Egypt as Head of the british political Mission with the Egyptian Expeditionary Eorce,in company with M. Picot, the Head of the ErenchPolitical Mission, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykesshould report to them in person the action he proposed totake, and should receive their instructions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W.,April 2, 1917.(Initialled)D.
