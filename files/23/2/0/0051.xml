The Western FrontI. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the french had done very well during the previous two days, and that veryhard fighting was going on on the British Front. He reported thatthe British casualties since the 1st May amounted to 26,500, andthat the total casualties since the beginning of the offensive atArras were 110,000.Mesopotamia. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that trainswere now running between Baghdad and Samarra, which was theextent of the existing railway from the former city.In Caucasia the Russians had retired from a part of their line, but this was not unexpected, as they had already said thatthey could take no offensive action, and were probably short ofsupplies.Roumania.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff referred to a telegram received from the Military Attache in Roumania, to the effect that russian agents were endeavouring to organise a revolution in thatcountry.Submarines. 4. The First Sea  Lord  gave  his usual report of shippingcasualties due to enemy submarines. He stated that the transport&quot; Palm Branch &quot; had been attacked by two submarines, and it was certain that one of them had been sunk. He also reported that all women on board the transport &quot;Transylvania&quot; had been saved. Inthe latter case, the escort of two Japanese torpedoJooat destroyers had been handled with great skill and gallantry, and had picked upthe majority of the survivors.The Secretary of State for War explained that the&quot; Transylvania &quot; was carrying details for Egypt and Salonica, andthat of a total of 3,100 on board the losses were under 200.The First Sea Lord explained the nature of the action of submarine against submarine, and said that the operations of oursubmarine craft in this direction had recently been more effective.Liquor restriction and Control.5. The War Cabinet considered the Government policy inregard to the control of the drink trade, in view of the discussion tobe held in the House of Commons on the following day. It wasdecided that Subject to his approval, a definite statement should be made bythe Prime Minister, announcing that the Government had decided in favour of  the State purchase of the liquor -trade.It was felt to be of great importance that the statement should provide an indication of the Governments policy as a whole, so that Ithe qualifications with regard to Local Option and Prohibition mightbe made known at the same time.The Chief Secretary for Ireland and the Minister of Munitions were instructed to take part in the Debate.Shipments ofWheat from america.6. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the Royal&apos;Commission on Wheat to Lord Devonport (Paper G.T.-649), in.which it is pointed out that &quot; two British Government organisation^exist in America which control the movement of railway traffic foFshipment,&quot; namely, the representatives of the Shipping Controll(rand of the Ministry of Munitions ; and, further, that this &quot; divide^control&quot;- has led to the fact that the shipments of cereals for Miwill not come up to requirements.   The Royal Commission on Whe&apos;
suggest that the two organisations &apos;* should, be amalgamated and placed under the sole charge of the Shipping Controller,&quot; with aview to securing an absolute priority for the prescribed minimum of foodstuffs over the American rails.Dr. Addison stated that both his Department and that of theShipping Controller had cabled out to their representatives, asking them to confer with Mr. Alan Anderson, of the Royal Commission on wheat, who was in the United.States of America.The War Cabinet decided that The matter should be left to the decision of the two Depart-ments concerned. In the event of their being unable tocome to a settlement. Lord Milner should be requested toarbitrate.7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum,dated the I st May, by the President of the Board of Trade (paper g.T.-617), demonstrating the need for additional labour to that nowobtainable, in order to maintain the requisite supply of timber in thiscountry.The President of the Board of Trade stated that he was informedthat unless the men were found for this purpose there would be atimber famine in a few months, at the present rate of consumption.with  reference to the decision of the War Cabinet (WarCabinet 125, Minute 12 (a) ), which restricted the importation of timber unless the sanction of the War Cabinet had been obtained onthe urgent representation of the Department concerned, it was statedthat instances had occurred in which vessels had returned from sweden in ballast which might well have brought cargoes of timber.The War Cabinet decided that A Committee, consisting of: Lord Curzon (in the Chair),Lord Derby,Sir Albert Stanley,Sir Joseph Maclay,Sir Bamfylde Fuller,Captain Clement Jones (Secretary),should investigate the timber situation and report to theWar Cabinet.8. In reference to his Memorandum on the subject of theMachinery for Compulsory Rationing, dated the 2nd May, 1917(Paper G-148), the Food Controller stated that he had brought thematter before the War Cabinet for a decision in principle upon asystem of compulsory rationing. He pointed out that our position asregards food was really governed by&apos; the size of the stocks held, andthat, with reasonable shipping facilities for import, the country couldcarry on till next harvest. This proposition was accepted, but itwas explained that it was the feeding of the nation after the 1stSeptember, 1917, which was the difficult problem, and that theintroduction of any new system must necessarily take so much time that, in order to make it operative even after the 1st September, thematter ought to be taken in hand at once. Although we mightcarry on for a few months with the present stocks and rate of con-sumption under the existing system, it would not be possible to carryon for a year without control of distribution.In this connection it was suggested that the poor in the East ofLondon were already restricted in the supply of certain commoditiesof food, because these were being bought up by the wealthier classesas economical substitutes.

Mr. Duke informed the War Cabinet that in at least twodistricts in Ireland the populace had already been within measurabledistance of famine, which had happily been averted.Lord Devonport explained that the system for which he was working out the organisation and machinery was one of ticketrationing, which would bring the action of local authorities into play.This he considered to be most desirable, whatever system might? beadopted.After some discussion the conclusion was reached that the WarCabinet had not sufficient knowledge of the possible alternativesystems to enable them to detsrmine whether the ticket rationing system was better than any other.   It was decided that A Sub-Committee, consisting of Lord Milner (in the Chair),Mr. Henderson, andLord Devonport,should consider the scheme put forward by the FoodController and other possible alternatives, calling in suchexpert advice as they might require, and report the result to the War Cabinet.It was also decided that In the event of a question oh this subject in Parliament, no information should be given regarding the amount of our existing stocks, but that a reply should be given to theeffect that, although the Government hoped that theywould not be forced to apply a system of compulsoryrationing, a scheme bad been worked out in the event ofits application being necessary.(Initialled)      A.
