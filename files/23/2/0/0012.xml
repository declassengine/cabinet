2Anglo-French 1. THE War Cabinet decided that Conference. &apos;The members of the Anglo-French Conference who had arrived in London that day should attend a Meeting at 10, downing street, in the afternoon ; that the respective militarymembers should discuss the points which particularly affected them separately, whilst the remaining membersconsidered other subjects. The general question of trans-portation should be raised.Mesopotamia.; 2. When informing the War Cabinet of the capture of Baghdadby the British forces, the Chief -of the Imperial General Staff took the opportunity to explain that the performance was even moremeritorious than appeared from the accounts in the press, owing tothe fact that the troops under Lieut.-General Sir S. Maude had been opposed by eight or nine fresh Turkish battalions which hadreinforced the enemy&apos;s forces since the fighting at Kut-el-Amara, andhad made a determined resistance. The War Cabinet decidedthat (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should send acongratulatory telegram to the General Officer Com-manding the British force in Mesopotamia ;(b.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer should make a statement in the House of Commons on the subject of our success,giving further details of the action, from information that would be supplied by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, and laying stress on the great improvementthat had been brought about in the supply organisationof the Army.The Western Front.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported a continua-tion of the withdrawal further back of the German Headquarterson the Western Front, this movement now extending from Ypres inthe north to - Soissons in the south. He&quot; also stated that, in theopinion of the French, there were indications of the probability ofretirements on the part of the German troops on our right, and thatthere were signs that the new German divisions which had recentlybeen formed were being pushed forward into Belgium (War Cabinet,91, Minute 5).Uniform for Labour 4. At the instance of Sir George Perley a short preliminaryBattalions. discussion took place on the question whether the men from the oversea Dominions who were serving in Labour Battalions shouldwear uniform.   The War Cabinet decided that The question should be referred to a conference between lord derby, the Secretary of State for W^ar, and Sir GeorgePerley.Loss of a Transport.The Bamming ofan ItalianSubmarine.5. The First Sea Lord enumerated the naval losses and incidentswhich had occurred since his last statement, and reported the lossof the transport &quot; Georgian,&quot; which had been torpedoed on the 8thMarch near Crete, and that the British sloop &quot; Cyclamen,&quot;whilst doing escort duty, had sunk an Italian submarine off Corsica.In reference to the latter occurrence th* Admiralty had telegraphedto the Italian Government to express the regrets of the Board ofAdmiralty, and had directed that an enquiry should be held intothe circumstances that led to the accident. The Italians had been warned beforehand of the passage of the &quot; Cyclamen &quot; and the shipshe was escorting, and, according to the information at present available, it did not seem that any blame could be attached to theBritish commander.
Losses by-Submarines.Q6. The First Sea Lord stated his opinion that the position into losses from the action of enemy submarines was rather more satisfactory than he had expected, if the fact that the period of full moon just over were taken into consideration.regardLoss of the BelgianRelief Ship&quot; Storstad.&quot;7. The First Lord expressed his opinion that the sinking of theBelgian relief ship &quot; Storstad &quot; by the Germans was a particularlybad case, this vessel having been sunk one hour after she had beenfirst attacked, and after she had hoisted the Belgian colours. TheWar Cabinet decided that The details of this action should be made public after they hadbeen confirmed.Bagdad: 8. The War Cabinet had under consideration a draft Proclama-Proelamation. tion, which it was proposed to issue to the people of Baghdad,which had been prepared by representatives of the Foreign Officeand India Office, in consultation with Lieutenant-Colonel Sir MarkSykes. On this draft Proclamation the Secretary of State for india had noted his apprehension that some of its terms might easily leadto charges of breach of faith in the future, if circumstances shouldrender it impossible to give the complete freedom which they mightbe held to promise. He therefore submitted certain suggestedamendments and a draft telegram to the Government of India(Paper G.T.-139. Appendix I). Sir Mark Sykes read a memorandumon the Secretary of State for India&apos;s amendments to the proposedProclamation (Paper G.T.-142.   Appendix II).The War Cabinet, whilst agreed in principle as to thedesirability of developing the self-government of the Arabs under their own laws and according to their own institutions, were ofopinion that the British Government should not, at the present stage of the war, use language that might be held to imply under-takings which it could not be certain of carrying out. On the otherhand, they recognised the very great importance, both from the pointof view of the future and from that of the present conduct of* military operations, not only of initiating a policy that would satisfy the Arabs throughout the East, but of announcing the fact publiclyin a manner that would appeal to their imagination.In accordance with the above views, the War Cabinet discussed the advisability ; of omitting the whole of the second sentence of clause 7 of the draft Proclamation (Appendix II), and of adopting the Secretary of State for India&apos;s alternative draft for clause 9 ; but,in order that the matter might be given full consideration, the WarCabinet decided that-The terms of the draft Proclamation, and the nature of the communication on the subject to be made to the political officer of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, shouldbe considered by a Committee composed of Lord Curzon,Lord Milner,Mr. A. Chamberlain,Lord Hardinge,which Committee should make such alterations as were necessary in the draft and report their decision to&quot; theWar Cabinet.
The Calais 9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a letter fromConference. Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff dated the 11th March (Appendix III), on the subject of the exact effect on the relations of the two Commanders-in-chief of theAgreement signed at Calais on the 27th February (War Cabinet, 82,Appendix III).The War Cabinet approved the proposals in Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig&apos;s letter, subject to the reservation of the third andfourth items in paragraph 15, for discussion between Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in thefirst instance and the Prime Minister subsequently. They concurredwith Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig that the liaison mission to beattached to th^F^ench General Headquarters could not have the extended role^ proposed by General Nivelle.The InterimEeport of theDardanellesCommission.lO-^he Prime Minister drew i&amp; the attention of the WarCabinet^ a letter he had received from Mr. Winston Churchillpointing out that he himself and, to a less extent, the late Govern-ment were injured by some of the excisions made in the Report ofthe Dardanelles Commission as approved for publication, andexpressing his opinion that the summary of evidence contained inthe Commission^ Report did not in all cases present that evidenceproperly, and that, in consequence, he would feel obliged to press for the publication of so much of the evidence as it was not essential in the public interest to conceal.   The War Cabinet decided that It would not be in the public interest to publish the evidencetaken by the Dardanelles Commission, in view of thestrongly expressed opinion of the Commission itself.In regard to the particular objections urged by Mr. Churchillto the excision of certain portions, the War cabinet authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he thought fit, to make an offer in the House of Commons that he himself should meet Mr. Asquith and Mr. Churchill&quot;with a view to the preparation of new paragraphs whichshould sufficiently represent the substance of the excisedpassages and could be published without injury to thepublic interest.The First Reportof the mesopotamia commission.The Second Reportof the dardanelles commission.11. The War Cabinet briefly discussed the question of whetherKin view of the difficulties which have arisen, as the result of thepublication of the Interim Repc&amp;t of the Dardanelles Commission, itwould be practicable and expedient to postpone publication in thecases of the Report of the Mesopotamian Commission and the second report of the Dardanelles Commission. The War Cabinet con-sidered that In viewr of the terms of section 6 of &quot; The Special Commissions(Dardanelles and Mesopotamia) Act, 1916,&quot; the publicationof the Reports could not be postponed except by means ofan Amending Act.The views of Lord George Hamilton, Chairman of theMesopotamia Commission, were reported to the WarCabinet, to the effect that, in view more particularly of theenquiry which the Commission had been instructed to holdinto the medical and transport questions, it would beimpossible to escape publication, nor would he advise it.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 12, 1917.(Initialled)D.

APPENDIX I.Baghdad.I CIRCULATE draft proclamation for publication in Baghdad, if and when our troops occupy it, as agreed between Sir M. Sykes and representatives of the ForeignOffice and India Office.A very early decision on its terms is reqiiested.I am myself uneasy about the wide terms of the promise conveyed in para-graph 7, and fear that they may easily lead to charges of breach of faith in future, if circumstances render it impossible for us to give the complete freedom which they- may be held to promise. I am not aware that the Cabinet has ever definitely decidedwhat the exact political position of the Baghdad vilayet should be, and I doubt whether it is possible to decide that question at this moment.I therefore suggest an alternative formula, which, I think, equally suitable under present circumstances and less fraught with clanger for the future.(Initialled) A. C.March 10, 1917.Baghdad.Draft Proclamation.To the People of Baghdad :1. In the name of my King and in the name of the people over whom he rules, Iaddress you as follows : 2. Our military operations have as their object the defeat of the enemy, and thedriving of him from these territories. In order to complete this task, I am chargedwith absolute and supreme control of all regions in which British troops operate, but our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but asliberators.3. Since the days of Halaka your city and your lands have been subject to thetyranny of strangers, your palaces have fallen into ruins, your gardens have sunken indesolation, and your forefathers and yourselves have groaned in bondage. Your sonshave been carried off to wars not of? your seeking, your wealth has been stripped from you by unjust men and squandered in distant places.4. Since the days of Midhat, the Turks have talked of reforms, yet do hot the ruinsand wastes of to-day testify the vanity of those promises ?5. It is the wish not only of my King and his peoples, but it is also the wish ofthe great nations with whom he is in alliance, that you should prosper even asin thepast, when your lands were fertile, when your ancestors gave to the world literature,science, and art, and when Baghdad city stretched from Kadhimain to Dialah.6. Between your people and the dominions of my King there has been a closebond of interest. For 200 years have the merchants of Baghdad and Great Britaintraded together in mutual profit and friendship. On the other hand, the Germans andTurks who have despoiled you and yours, have, for twenty years, made Baghdad a centre of power from which to attack the dominions of the British and theAllies of the British in Persia and Arabia, therefore the British government cannot remain indifferent as to what takes place in your country now or in the future,for in duty to the interests of the British people and their Allies the British government cannot risk that being done in Baghdad again which has been done by the Turks and germans during the war. .    . .7. But you people of Baghdad are not to understand from this that it is the wishof the British Government to impose upon you alien institutions. [But remember itrests with those who are well advised among you to prepare the way so that theBritish people may when the time comes give freedom to those who have provedthemselves worthy to enjoy their own wealth and substance under their own institutions[1365-94] C
and laws.]* In Hejaz the Arabs have expelled the Turks and Germans who oppressedthem and proclaimed the Sherif Hussein as their King, and his Lordship rules inindependence and freedom and is the ally of the nations who are fighting against thepower of Turkey and Germany ; so, indeed, are the noble Arabs, the Lords of Koweit,Nejd, and Asir.&quot;* Alternative formula proposed by Mr. Chamberlain: . . . . alien institutions.It is the desire of the British Government that the Arabs of Irak and Baghdad shall infuture be free from oppression, and enjoy their wealth and substance under institutions and laws congenial to them.8. Many noble Arabs have perished in the cause of Arab freedom at the hands ofthose alien rulers, the Turks, who oppressed them. It is the determination of theGovernment of Great Britain and the Great Powers allied to Great Britain that thesenoble Arabs shall not have suffered in vain. It is the hope and desire of the british people and the nations in alliance with them that the Arab race may rise once more togreatness and renown among the peoples of the earth, and that it shall bind itselftogether to this end in unity and concord.. 9. O people of Baghdad, remember that for 800 years you have suffered underPowers which have ever endeavoured to set one Arab house against another in orderthat it might profit by your dissensions. This policy is abhorrent to Great Britain and her Allies, for there can be neither peace nor prosperity where there is enmity andmisgovernment. Therefore I am commanded to invite you, through your noblesand elders and representatives, to participate in the management of your civil affairs in collaboration with the political representatives of Great Britain who accompany theBritish army [so that in due time you may be in a position to unite with your kinsmenin north, east, south, and west in realising the aspirations of your race].fI Alternative formula proposed by Mr. Chamberlain : .... so that you may beunited with your kinsmen in north, east, south, and west in realising the aspirations ofyour race.From General Maude, Basra, 6th March, 1917. (Received 12T0 p.m., 8th March.)X. 1140 (6th).Should we occupy Baghdad, scope of civil administration will be greatly increased and number of civil and political officers will be urgently required.Government will, I am sure, appreciate immense importance of starting civil administration of Baghdad vilayet on satisfactory lines Avith adequate staff, and I trust that utmost may be done to comply with Cox&apos;s requisitions for individual officers.(Addressed to Foreign, Delhi; repeated to Secretary of State for India.)Draft Telegram- to Government of India.(Foreign Secret.)Maude&apos;s telegram 6th March.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not underrate the importance of sound administration in Baghdad, and fully appreciate efficiency of that introduced by your officers in. Basra.But the basis of their policy is the Arab State, and they are not prepared to approve the extension of direct British administration to Baghdad vilayet. Until the war is over and the whole set of problems connected with the Arab State have been cleared up with King Husain and the other Allies, the predominant considerations in Baghdadmust be political rather than administrative. His MajestyV Government thereforewish it to be clearly understood that, whatever may be ultimate decision, the existingadministrative machinery is, as far as possible, to be preserved for the present, withthe substitution of Arab for Turkish spirit and personnel. The facade must be Arab.While, therefore, vilayet should remain under martial law for the security of the occupying force, the inhabitants should be formally invited to participate in the civil administration with British co-operation. Every effort should be made to inducerepresentative men to come forward for this purpose, and the British officers to be lentshould be strictly limited to minimum necessary as advisers.
APPENDIX II.Memorandum on Mr. Austen Chamberlain&apos;s Amendment of the Proposed proclamation to the People of Baghdad..I HAVE read the amendment, and I consider that it will be understood by theArab Nationalist party to mean that Baghdad is to be a part of the Indian Empire, a prospect which would be abhorrent to them for a variety of reasons.The Arab is above all proud ; he does not want favours granting him. If we desire to get on with the Arabs we must not patronise, but we must be firm.The difference between the two paragraphs is this : the original paragraph, ifproperly translated, will mean, &quot;If you support us, you will be our equals in internal affairs, which you will manage yourselves ; if you do not, we have a free hand.&quot; Theamendment means, &quot;Whether you behave well or ill we shall give you good treatment,but we shall settle your affairs for you.&quot;I am certain if we take the line of trying to rule Arabs as we rule Indians, we shallfail. We shall introduce the social colour distinction and antagonise the whole Arabmovement ; we shall have the intellectuals against us from the very start, and it is theintellectuals who will rule public opinion when peace comes.For the moment Baghdad is probably a stricken, deserted city, and the proclamation will have little local effect, but the influence of the proclamation in syria, Mesopotamia, and Arabia will, I make no doubt, be very great. Further, itwill force the hands of the French. M. Picot sincerely desires to work the Arab State,but he has repeatedly told me of the opposition to which he is subjected by colonialexpansionists, who only desire to impose dominion by force on the Arabs.If we set up autonomy as our ideal we get the sympathy of every ArabNationalist, we make it almost impossible for the French to go in for forcible dominion,and we pave the way for a better state of things in Egypt. If we offer benefits in a&quot; white mans burden &quot; tone of voice we pave the way for discontent, and a coalitionbetween the Arabic-speaking Egyptian Nationalists and the Arab intellectuals. Ourpath is beset with dangers ; if we are courageous, we have every prospect of beingsupreme in region (B), and beloved in region (A). If we do not play up to Arab racialpride in Baghdad, then we shall make Baghdad a restless appanage instead of a centre of influence.Baghdad is a natural capital of practically all the inhabited areas of region (B).If we make it an Arab capital we shall control the Arabs, because we shall controlBaghdad commercially, and by clause 6 we can maintain troops there.Baghdad will be a centre of education and civilisation for all the Arabic-speakingworld : if it is restless, hostile, or sullen, our influence will wane ; if it is friendly our *influence will wax.   It will never accept our open dominion, but, if we play our cardsproperly by means of &quot; advisers &quot; instead of &quot;rulers,&quot; and back Arab nationalism, weshall have a permanent footing at little cost.The Arab ideal has been local autonomy ever since the constitution of 1908, it isthe desire for local autonomy which has had such disastrous results for the Turks.There is much in a name, the Arabs will not object to the presence of British troops and a British General, British advisers, and British merchants, but they will neverendure either the idea of a British Governor-General or an outwardly Britishdirect-controlled civil service.Further, it must be remembered that the Turks never denied the Arabs eithersocial equality or executive power. Field-Marshal Mahmud Shefket, Commander-in-Chief of the Turkish Army, was a Baghdadi, and virtually an Arab ; Izzet, the greatSecond Secretary of Abdul Hamid, was a Damascene ; that is to say, that the two most powerful persons in the Empire were men of Arab extraction. It is impossible to approach a people with an intellectual class which has produced men who have heldsuch offices in the same spirit as one might approach tribesmen or natives who acceptEuropean superiority as a matter of course.The political conditions and possibilities in the area between Kut and Kerkuk are entirely different to the conditions between Kut and Basra. The southern area is a country which has relapsed into complete barbarism and anarchy, and is inhabitedpractically by savages with no intellectual class, and I am pretty sure the Arabnationalist party would be glad to see- us rule it. The northern area has been thecentre of organised government from time immemorial, and has sent an annual quota
to the military and civil service schools, and consequently has in peace time a largeintellectual class. The members of this class are, it is true, scattered and terrified, butit is of the greatest importance to demonstrate to them that their ideals are notcontrary to ours, and to leave the door open for them to come in on our side without loss of dignity. Of course, everything depends on our capacity to hold Baghdad, andit will require some considerable period of occupation to prove this to the people, whowill remember that the Arab leaders who took our part at Ivut were hanged, andthat though we exchanged prisoners with the Turks we were unable to protect thosewho had taken our side.(Initialled) M. S&apos;.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.   .,March 10, 1917.APPENDIX III.(O.A.D. 335.)C.I.G.S., - March 11, 1917.1. AS the Cabinet are aware, I am of opinion that, from a purely military point ofview, the recent Cabinet decision, as recorded in the agreement made at Calais on the27th February last, is open to grave objections ; and I fear that it will tend to impairrather than to promote unity of effort.2. I pointed out in my official memorandum, handed to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff at Calais on the morning of the 27th February, that I could see no satis-factory alternative between the system which obtained previous to the CalaisConference and the placing of our armies in France entirely under the french commander-in-Chief, the latter being a course which I did not recommend.3. The proposals put forward by the French authorities at.the Conference wouldpractically have given them complete control of our armies, but these proposals werenot accepted, and eventually a compromise was decided on.4. While realising the difficulties of working this compromise sriccessfully, I felt it my duty to say that I would do my best to give effect to the Cabinefs decision. Ihave done so, and will continue to do so, but the situation which has arisen since theConference, in regard to the relations between the French and. British commands,appears to me to be so unsatisfactory and even dangerous that I think it necessary tomake a full and frank statement of my views on &quot;it. I do so after careful reflection andwith a full sense of the seriousness of what I have to say.5. At Calais General Nivelle assured me that the proposed alteration of our existing relations had not been brought about by any action or wish of his, or even with his knowledge. I believed that he would help me to make the best of a difficult situation, but that hope has not been realised.G. Immediately after the Conference I received from him instructions, couched insomewhat dictatorial language, and this communication was followed a few days laterby another in a still stronger tone. Apart from any question of personal dignity, whichI am anxious to sink as far as I can, I submit that the tone of these letters, addressedto a British Field-Marshal, Commanding the largest Armies the Empire has ever placedin the field, and drawn from all parts of it, is open to tobjection.7. A still more serious objection is that in these letters an effort is made to graspmore power over our Armies than was conferred by the Calais Agreement.8. This tendency was shown in the original proposals made by the french authorities at the Calais Conference, and it appears again in the entire change proposed in the duties of the British Mission at French General Headquarters.9. Hitherto the Head of this Mission has been my representative with the french commander-in-Chief, and I understood that this system was to continue, and that allthat was asked for was more senior officers and a larger number of them. This, ifconsidered advantageous, I am quite ready to accede to, but what is now asked foramounts to a British General Staff, through which I am to receive General Nivelle&apos;orders, and which is to report direct, over my head, to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.10. I had heard rumours before the Calais Conference of a desire in some quarters in France to gain practically complete control over the British Armies, and even tobreak up their unity and &quot;sandwich&quot; British units and formations between french troops under French control.
11. I do not presume to say that responsible French authorities would countenanceny such scheme, but I cannot overlook the tendency shown to seize more power, asitnessed by the facts I have quoted.12. It is natural that France should hope to emerge from the war with a nationaltriumph and as great a position as possible in the eyes of the world, but in my opinionit would be very dangerous to fail to make full allowance for national feeling on our side also, and especially in our Armies. If those Armies were placed under French control,I venture to say that, apart from wounded dignity, a belief might very easily arise thatBritish interests and British casualties were being treated as at most a secondaryconsideration, and very serious friction would result.13. Whatever may be the views of the War Cabinet on these questions, I must point out to them that at a moment when all my energies and thoughts should be devoted to dealing with a very complicated military situation, which is likely todevelop into the decisive crisis of the war, I find myself involved in what almostamounts to a controversy with our Allies, of such importance that much of my time istaken up by it.14. In my view there is too much at stake for me to avoid this controversy. As Iconceive my duties and responsibilities I cannot consent to order operations or to makedispositions which I believe to be dangerous or unsound and likely to prejudice the safety, welfare, and success of the British Armies under my command. My positionand that of my General Headquarters would become impossible if the Calais agreement were strained by the French Command beyond what I conceive to have been intendedby the War Cabinet.15. A remedy for the existing state of affairs is very urgently required. i recognise that the Calais Agreement must hold good until the situation on which it was based is judged by the War Cabinet to have changed ; but I submit that the intentionand terms of the agreement, which appear to me to have been misunderstood by theFrench authorities, should now be so clearly defined as to prevent any futuremisunderstanding. With that object in view, I venture to suggest that it should bemade clear to the French authorities : That, except with the British Commander-in-Chief&apos;s consent, the French Commandis not authorised to issue instructions to or have any direct official communication withany commander, body of troops, or individual in the British Armies other than theBritish Commander-in-Chief, with whom alone the execution of such instructions will rest.That the French Commander-in-Chief is not to inspect British troops or visit themofficially without the British Oommander-in-Chiefs consent.That while it will be the duty of the British Commander-in-Chief to furnish all necessary information as to his plans, and copies of his orders, to give effect to theoperations arranged for it is not within the rights of the French Commander-in-Chiefto demand copies of orders issued by subordinates, or of the plans made within theBritish Armies to carry out the orders of the British Commander-in-Chief. TheBritish Commander-in-Chief, however, will always be prepared to arrange for an exchange of orders when necessary to ensure effective co-operation.That the French Commander-in-Chief is not permitted to remove any British troopsor individuals from the command of their Commander-in-Chief, but, if necessary, inorder to exploit a success following the&quot; effective breaking of the enemy&apos;s line on theFrench front during the operations arranged for, the British Commander-in-Chief will,consistent with the security of the British Armies, at once comply with any demands made by the French Commander-in-Chief for such exploitation, it being understoodthat the troops so detached will remain under the orders of the British Commander-in-Chief.  .That while the British Commander-in-Chief has been directed to conform toGeneral Nivelle&apos;s instructions under certain defined conditions, it is desirable thatGeneral Nivelle should address his instructions in the form of requests to an equal,and not as orders to a subordinate.That the conditions laid down in the Calais Agreement referred specifically tocertain defined offensive operations, and do not give the French Commander-in-Chiefany right to dictate to the British Commander-in-Chief on other offensive operations, oron such questions as the defence of the remainder of his front, or the measures taken and dispositions made therefor.That in case of difference of opinion, the British War Cabinet reserved to itself theright to decide as to whether any given conditions fall under the terms of the Calais
Agreement or not. As regards the new Mission, it is essential that the duties and responsibilities to be entrusted to it be clearly defined before it is appointed, and thatit be definitely laid down in writing, and agreed to, that the members of the Missionare the representatives of the British Commander-in-Chief, and are under his orders.They are not to be regarded as staff officers of the French Commander-in-Chief,authorised to convey his instructions to the British Commander-in-Chief, though theymay be employed if so desired to draft such instructions for General NivehVssignature.All instructions and communications should be signed by General Nivelle and not by a staff officer.Finally, I suggest that it would help me in a difficult task if the War Cabinet sawfit to communicate to the French Government the expression of confidence in myselfwhich was conveyed to me in War Office letter No. 0.1/86/253 dated the 2nd March,1917, and their belief in my will and intention to carry out loyally the terms ofthe Calais Agreement.I trust that in due course the relations existing before the Calais Conference willbe restored, as I am convinced that more satisfactory results can be obtained on those lines.In the meantime, if the above recommendations are accepted, I consider that itshould prove easier than it is now to carry out the terms and to attain the objects ofthe Calais Agreement, and I desire to state my emphatic opinion that otherwise thepresent difficulties are likely to increase, and an impasse may be reached, despite myearnest desire to sink all personal considerations and to do my utmost to ensure thesuccess of the Allied cause.(Signed) D. HAIG, Field-marshal commanding-in-Chief British Armies in France.
