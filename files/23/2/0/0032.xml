THE War Cabinet read a message from Mr. Tuehy to thePress Message. &quot;New York World,&quot; submitted to them by Sir Frank Swettenham,G.C.M.G., one of the Directors of the Press Bureau.   They decidedthat The whole message, much of which was mischievous, should be stopped.The Secretary immediately informed Sir Frank Swettenham(4-30 p.m.).Control of Coal 2. With reference to War Cabinet, 65, Minute 8, of the 14thMines. February, 1917, the President of the Board of Trade summarised the proposals set forth by him in a Memorandum on the Control ofCoal Mines of the United Kingdom (Paper G.T.-304, Appendix I).It was proposed to give the coal-owners a modified form of guarantee of their pre-war profits. Each undertaking would be entitled toretain out of its profits a sum equivalent to the actual pre-war profits,as determined, for the purposes of the Excess Profits Duty, togetherwith one-fourth of any excess profits after the Excess Profits Dutyhad been deducted ; provided, however, that in no case should theundertaking retain excess profits amounting to more than one-fifth of the pre-war profits. In other words, the Excess Profits duty would be the basis for determining any increase due to the mine-owners. They now were entitled to retain 40 * per cent. It issuggested that they should retain one-fourth of their excess profits,but in no circumstances should they be able to retain excess[1365-114] B
profits 20 per cent, in excess of their pre-war profits. special consideration would be given to cases where the output fell below or increased beyond the pre-war output, owing to the direct intervention of the Coal Controller, but this would not apply to output&quot; so far asit was traceable to recruiting.In siipport of the above proposals it was urged that prices ofcoal have fallen, and that a reduction of wages would therefore notbe unreasonable, but it is not proposed to lower them ; secondly,that the same degree of care for the property was not now given asin peace time, but no claim by the mine-owners on that account would be entertained when the period of control came to an end.On the other hand, the proposals might be criticised asguaranteeing profits on a basis of abnormally prosperous years andnot on a par with the Governments treatment of railways.The War Cabinet approved the proposals, but impressed on theCoal Controller the importance of consulting the various interests involved, and especially the miners&apos; representatives.Food Supply:Maximum prices for Home-grown wheat, Barley, andOats.3. The War Cabinet had before them memoranda by the FoodController on the price of home-grown wheat (Paper G.T.-345), andon the price of barley and oats (Paper G.T.-362)-(Appendix II),in which it is shown that the prices of these cereals are already highand are likely to rise in the immediate future unless some check is put upon them. Indignation against excessive profit-making was becoming widespread and might menace the agricultural policy ofof the Government.   The War Cabinet authorised : The Food Controller to issue an Order fixing the followingmaximum prices : 78s. per 480 lb. for home-grown wheat.65s. per 4001b.      ,, ,,      barley.48s. per 312 lb.      ,, ,,      oats.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 6, 1917.(Initialled)D.

APPENDIX I.G.T.-304.Control of Coalmines of United Kingdom.- I ATTACH a statement showing the heads of the proposed financial arrangement\)j with the coalowners of Great Britain and Ireland.The objects aimed at are : 1. To arrive at an agreement fairly acceptable to the coalowners. and thus avoid the delays involved iu a reference of the question of compensation to theDefence of the Realm Losses Commission.2. By arriving at an agreement, to obtain the co-operation of the owners in any measures the Controller of Coal Mines may find it necessary to adoptwhich will interfere with the normal business of the trade.3. By putting a stop to inflated profits, to convince the miners that the result oftheir work will not be any undue enrichment of the owners, but will bea direct benefit to the State.4. Whilst giving effect to (3), to secure at the same time that the owners retain some interest in the scientific and economical working of their property.5. To exclude the possibility of any after-war claims for damage to propertiesarising out of the control.A. H. S.Board of Trade, March 27, 1917.Heads of Proposed Agreement with Owners.1. The whole undertaking of each owner, as at ,to be brought into control, with the exception of such portions of the undertaking as,in the opinion of the Controller of Coal Mines, are properly separate and separablefrom the Mines, or such portions to which the limitation of profits provisions of the munitions of War Act apply. For the purpose of such separation the owners to berequired as from the , or such other date as the Controllermay fix, to keep entirely separate accounts for the controlled portions of the under-taking. The prices charged on departmental transactions between the controlled anduncontrolled portions of the undertaking to be on a commercial basis and approvedfrom time to time by the Controller.2. Subject to the right of the Controller at any time to assume, on such conditionsor terms as he shall determine, full or partial control, either generally or of districts, orof individual undertakings or collieries, the several undertakings shall continue under their existing management on the following conditions and terms :  (a.) Cost accounts, trading accounts, and balance-sheets, and any other accountsthat the Controller may reqture, in such form and at such times as he may from timeto time-determine, shall be furnished by the several undertakings. Such accountsshall be audited and verified as the Controller may direct.(6.) Each undertaking shall be entitled to retain out of its profits a sum equivalentto the a*ctual pre-war profits, as determined for the purposes of the excess profits duty,together with one-fourth of any excess profits after the excess profits duty has beendeducted, iDrovided, however, that in no case shall the undertaking retain excessprofits amounting to more than one-fifth of the pre-war profits.Undertakings earning less than 9 per cent, in the case of companies and 10 percent, in the case of private owners, and thus not corning within the operation of the excess profits duty, shall be allowed to retain out of their profits a sum equivalent tothe actual pre-war profits together with the same proportion of any profits in excess oftheir pre-war profits as is allowed in the case of undertakings dealt with in thepreceding paragraph.Cases to which the provisions of the two preceding paragraphs cannot properly beapplied, i.e., cases of developing mines or cases in which there was no pre-war profit,shall be specially considered.Should the profits of any undertaking be less than the amount of its pre-warprofits, the Controller will pay  the deficiencv to the owner, provided that there is no[1365-1141 B 2
greater reduction in output than per cent, compared with the pre-war output. Thecompensation in cases where the decrease in output is greater than per cent, or where the Controller decides to close a pit shall be the subject of special treatment.The terms of this agreement shall be in full compensation for all claims arisingout of the control.(c.) &quot; Profits &quot; in the preceding sub-clause shall mean the profits for an accountingperiod as determined under the Finance Acts, and. the excess retained by the owner,or the deficiencies made up to him under this agreement, shall be brought into account in subsequent accounting periods, so as to make retentions or deficiencies made up tothe owner accord with the surplus profits or deficiencies during the whole period ofcontrol. Where the period dealt with under this agreement does not synchronise withthe accounting period under the Finance Acts, the profits determined under such Actsshall be deemed to have accrued from day to day.(d.) The Controller and his representatives shall have full power at any time ofinspecting and taking copies of all books, plans, and documents of every kind, and ofinterrogating directors, managers, and employees on all matters directly or indirectlyconnected with the controlled portion of the undertaking.3. No dividends to be paid or loans repaid without the consent of the Controller.APPENDIX II.G.T.-345. --The Price oe Home-Grown Wheat.(Memorandum by the Food Controller.)I DKS1RE to direct the attention of the Cabinet to the high prices now being obtained for English wheat. Prices of 90s. and 91s. per quarter have been reported from different parts of the country. As English wheat becomes scarcer, millers, whorely upon a certain quantity to maintain the character of their mixtures, are willing topay exceptional prices to secure it.The course of English wheat prices since last harvest may be indicated by theGazette weekly averages at the end of each month : 	Gazette Price at 480 lb. per Quarter.	Equivalent at 504 lb. per Quarter.September 80 October 28 November 25 December 30 Jaiiuarj7 27 February 24 March SI	s.    d. aii   10 62   10 70     8 75   10 75   10 76     9 81     5	s.    d. 61     9 66     1 74    2 79     7 79     7 80    7 85     6The Gazette averages represent wheat at 480 lb. per quarter, whereas the newspaper quotations usually represent wheat at 504 lb. per quarter, the weight atwhich it is commonly sold.The prices at which imported wheat is now being sold by the Wheat Commissioncover a wide range for the various classes, the extremes being from 69s. (per 480 lb.)for the lowest grade Manitoba (No. 6 Special) to 87s. 6d, (per 492 lb.) for Choice WhiteBombay. Somewhere about SOs. to 82s. would represent the level at which the largerquantity is now being offered.The course, of wheat prices in the countries of origin during the next few monthscannot be predicted with any certainty. They will depend mainly in the immediatefuture on the prospects of the American crop. It is fairly certain, however, that theprices of English wheat will continue to rise unless some check is put upon them.The question therefore arises whether the time has not arrived for fixing maximum prices for home-grown wheat.
There are strong reasons for putting a check on the continued rise in prices. Ascompared with the pre-war level, the rise amounts to about 130 per cent., and it isobvious that the profits, after all allowance is made for increased cost of production,are large, and certainly much larger than oh any kind of farm produce. A feeling ofindignation against the wheat-growing farmer as a profiteer is Becoming wide-spread,and may become a menace to the agricultural policy of the Government.I submit, therefore, for the consideration of the War Cabinet that maximum prices$7/ should be fixed for home-grown wheat of the 1916 crop.   The actual price has beendiscussed with the President of the Board of Agriculture, and I suggest that it shouldbe fixed at 76s. per 480 lb., which is equal to 80s. per quarter of 504 lb.(Signed) DEVONPORT.Ministry of Food, April 2, 1917.APPENDIX II.G.T.-362. -The Price of Barley and Oats.(Memorandum by the Food Controller.)IN continuation of my note (Paper No. G.T.-345) on the price of home-grown wheat, I wish to direct the attention of the Cabinet to the position of barley and oats.Both these cereals are now in greater demand for food, as both are allowed under theMilling Order to be used for bread-making. Barley, owing to the ease with which itcan be dealt with in the ordinary flour mills, is in special demand by millers for thispurpose. The effect of the voluntary ration, and the economy of bread which isinduced thereby, has thrown a greater demand upon oatmeal, and extravagant prices have been reported to the Ministry as having been paid, in Scotland particularly, foroats and oatmeal.The following statement shows the course of the weekly averages of barley andoats since the beginning of the cereal year, the weeks quoted being at the end of each month : 	Barley.		Oats.		Gazette Price at 400 lb. per Quarter.	Equivalent, at 448 lb. per Quarter.	Gazette Price at 312 lb. per Quarter.	Equivalent at 336 lb. per Quarter.September 30 October 28 .. November 25 December 30 January 27 . .          ..          ;. February 24 March 31	s.     d. 54     1 54     6   -61     S 67     5 64     5 63     9 71   10	s.     d. 60     7 61     0 69     1 75     6 72     2 71     5 80     5	s.     d. 31     1 32   10 39     7 47     4 47     8 47     8 51 * 10	s.     d. 33     6 35     4 42     8 51     0 51 .    4 51     4 55   10The Gazette prices represent, in the case of barley, a quarter of 400 lb., and, inthe case of oats, a quarter of 312 lb. The usual lueight at which British barley is sold in the markets is 443 lb. per quarter, and, in the case of oats, 336 lb. per quarter.Neither barley nor oats are under direct control by the Government, and thereforediffer; in this respect from imported wheat, which is controlled by the wheat commission.The latest quotations current for imported barley and oats are as follows :  Barley, Indian      ..          .. .. .. .. 71s. per quarter (400 lb.)Barley, American               . , . - .. .. 70s.        ,,       (400 lb.)Oats, No. 2, white clipped, American .. .. .. G6s.        ,,       (320 1b.)Western Canadian . .           .. . . .. . . 67*. 6d.   ,.        (320 lb.)If it is considered necessary to continue the importation of barley and oats, thecontrol of imports should be taken over by the Government.
The price which I have suggested for home-grown wheat is 80s. per quarter of504 lb. I suggest that the maximum price for home-grown barley might be 72s. per quarter of 448 lb., and for home-grown oats, 51s. per quarter of 336 lb. Thecontinued rise in the prices of these cereals is now affecting the cost of bread, and Iconsider that it is necessary to arrest this rise so as to enable me to regulateeffectively the price of the loaf, which has already reached the highest level to whichit should be allowed to go.(Signed) DEVONPORT,Food Controller.Ministry of Food, April 4, 1917.
