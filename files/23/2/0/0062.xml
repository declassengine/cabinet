THE War Cabinet, while recognising the great services which Sir George Buchanan has rendered to his country, that histelegraphic appreciations of the situation have nearly always provedright, and that he has played a very courageous part in circumstancesof exceptional difficulty, generally agreed wdth the views placed before them by Lord Robert Cecil that, in existing conditions, he isno longer the ideal British representative in Petrograd. - The veryfact that in faithfully carrying out the instructions of the BritishGovernment he has established so exceptional a position, both withthe late regime and the late Provisional Government, may diminish the confidence in him of the present Russian Administration.
The War Cabinet are also impressed with the success achieved in Petrograd by M. Albert Thomas, the French Socialist leader, asshown by the public recognition given to his services in the intervievdjgranted by M. Terestchenko, the new Russian Minister of ForeignAffairs, to representatives of the Press in Russia (Petrograd telegramNo. 736, dated truth May). &apos;&quot;&apos;     *Holding that the success or failure of the Allies in this wardepends, to a great extent, on what Russia is going to do, the WarCabinet decided that The British representative in Petrograd should be a personcalculated to exercise a powerful influence on the democraticelements which now predominate in Russia to pursue thewar with energy. They therefore invited Mr. arthur henderson to make a personal sacrifice and to go toPetrograd on a similar footing to that of M. Albert Thomas.No immediate decision was considered necessary as to how. long Mr. Henderson should stay, but he was advised tomake his political arrangements on the assumption that the visit would be temporary. It was decided that, in theevent of Mr. Henderson&apos;s accepting the invitation, SirGeoige Buchanan should be retained in Petrograd for ashort time in order to post Mr. Henderson up on mattersof detail, At the end of a few weeks, subject, however, toMr. Hendersohs concurrence at the time, Sir GeorgeBuchanan should be recalled to London for purposes of consul-tation. It was generally agreed that it would be desirable for Mr. Henderson to leave at the earliest possible date.Mr. Henderson asked for a short time in which to consider, inits various bearings, this proposal which had been made tohim at very short notice.2. Lord Robert Cecil informed the War Cabinet that Messrs.macdonald, Jovvett, and Inkpins application for passports to proceedto Russia, which had been postponed for a week, would come beforethe Foreign Office again to-day. He himself was strongly in favourof allowing Mr. Ramsay macdonald to proceed to Russia, providedthat Mr. Henderson accepted the proposal in Minute 1. Mr. Hender-son read a telegram he had received from M. Thomas to the effectthat the Workmen&apos;s Council was awaiting the arrival of a british delegation, and that he attached great importance to the presence ofMr. Henderson himself.The War Cabinet decided that Passports ,-houid be granted to Mr. Ramsay macdonald and hiscolleagues to proceed to Russia, and that Mr. Hendersonshould arrange for a delegation of the Majority Section ofthe British Labour Party, headed by Mr. Roberts, toproceed to Russia, breaking their journey at Stockholmen route if it seemed advisable. They also decided thatthese permits should be held up for a few days in order toenable Mr. Henderson to reach Petrograd in advance of either Delegation. *3. The Secretary informed the War Cabinet that he had just received from the Secretary of State for Home Affairs a copy ofthe Report of the Mesopotamia Commission, accompanied by thefollowing Resolution by the Commission : &quot; The Commission is of opinion that the Act of Parliamentunder which they were appointed requires prompt publicationof the Report which has been agreed upon. The Commission,therefore, requests the Chairman to take such requisite steps as
are consistent with the public interests to secure the promptpublication of the Report.&quot;The Secretary stated^that Lord George Hamilton, desirous of avoiding the delays and alterations which had occurred in connectionwith the publication of the Dardanelles Report, had, on the28th April, suggested to the Prime Minister that the Report mightbe examined by the Military Authorities before it was finally signed.Owing to the Anglo-French Conference at Paris on the 4th and 5thMay, Lord George Hamiltoifs letter had not been answered untilthe 8th May, when the Secretary, under instructions from thePrime Minister, had offered Lord George Hamilton to have the draft report examined.On the 11th May Lord George Hamilton had replied that, inthe meanwhile, the Report hud passed through its final revision, andhad been signed by one Member who was going, abroad on officialbusiness. Consequently, no alteration of any kind or sort waspossible, and it was felt there would be no advantage in having theReport examined before it was complete.The Secretary added that when he heard that the Report had reached the Home Secretary, he had suggested that it should bereferred to the General Staff for examination in order to lose no time. The Home Secretary, however, did not think that he per-sonally could take the responsibility of sending the Report to theGeneral Staff, and considered that it should rest with the PrimeMinister and the War Cabinet to decide who should see the report before publication.The War Cabinet decided that As a military campaign is still being continued in Mesopotamia,it would not be in the public interest to publish the Reportuntil it had been examined by Lord Curzon, and by the naval staff and the General Staff! The Secretary was instructedto communicate this decision to the Home Secretary, andto ask him not to present the Report in dummy before theHouse of Commons rises this week. He was also instructedto communicate copies to Lord Curzon, the First Sea Lord,and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.The War Cabinet requested that the examination of the Reportin the Admiralty and War Office might be carried out as rapidly as possible.The Italian Front. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that the bombardment on the Italian front had been delayed by bad weather,but that a further attack might be anticipated in the near future.Russia: 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarThe Caucasus. Cabinet that he had received a telegram indicating that the Prussiantroops in the Caucasus would be obliged to withdraw further to the eastward in the autumn on account of their transport and supplybeing in a very bad state. He stated that he was telegraphing toGeneral Alexeieff urging him to make every effort to prevent suchaction becoming necessary.The Western Front: 6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadFrench Military received information from the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-ChiefPolicy. . to the effect that he had had a very satisfactory meeting with general petain, and he was of opinion that the French fully intended to actup to their part in the offensive and give whole-hearted co-operation.The Secretary of State for War then proceeded to report to theWar Cabinet the result of his visit, to France.    Pie stated he had
seen Sir Douglas Haig, who had assured him that his meeting on theprevious day with General Petain had been most satisfactory, andthat the latter had given him an assurance- that the French would continue to make real attacks on a fairly wide front with limitedobjectives.Sir Douglas Haig also stated that he was expecting to receive from General Petain full particulars in writing as to forces to beemployed, &amp;c.Lord Derby then informed the War Cabinet that he afterwardsproceeded to Paris, where he had seen M. Painleve, who had given him similar assurances to those given by General Petain toSir Douglas Haig. Lord Derby was perfectly satisfied there was every intention on the part of the French Government to give full effect to these promises, although M. Painleve had stated that theGovernment wrere somewhat disturbed at the low state of their reserves of men.Lord Derby had also seen General Petain, who confirmed the assurances given by him to Sir Douglas Haig. Lord Derby furtherstated that he had been informed that General Nivelle&apos;s failure hadbeen a great shock to the French Government, and was largely dueto want of ammunition, and that the French hospital arrangements had proved to be very badly organised.With regard to General Foch&apos;s position, M. Painleve had explained that General Foch had no powrer to interfere in any way with the execution of General Petain&apos;s plans, once the policy of theGovernment had been notified to the latter. General Foch merelyadvised the War Minister on the military aspect of the policydecided upon as a whole by the French War Committee.Lord Derbv stated that there appeared to be thorough accordbetween M. Painleve and General Petain.Greece: 7. Lord Derby informed the War Cabinet that he had askedAllied Policy. M. Painleve to express his views regarding Salonica.   M. Painleve&quot;had stated that the French War Committee had consented, muchagainst their will; to the withdrawal of one British infantry division and two British Cavalry Brigades, and did not intend towithdraw one of their divisions after the departure of the british division, &amp;c. His views, which were shared by M. Ribot and theFrench Government, w-ere somewhat as follows : The weakening of the Salonica Expeditionary Force, ultimatelyleading to the reduction of that Force to, say, one-half itsnumbers, would eventually lead to the Allies occupying thefortified lines of Salonica, where the garrison would sufferheavy casualties from fever. A reduced force based onSalonica w^ould run the greatest clanger from a hostileattack and from a hostile Greece. In his opinion, King Constantine might at any moment then join hands withthe Germans and threaten the Allied communications, and greek harbours w-ould become bases for submarines ; the* communications of the Allied forces in Salonica would then become impracticable, and might eventually lead to the surrender of the garrison.   The position, in his opinion,was extremely grave.      The   absolute   abandonment of&apos;Salonica was not to be contemplated for one moment.M. Painleve therefore proposed that the solution should be to-march on Thessalj- and occupy Athens with adequate forces, witha view to the capture and deposition of King Constantine and his followers, and the establishment of a Venizelist Government in its place. He said the French Government had no special liking forM. Venizeios, but he seemed to be the- only man they could rely on.In the same way they had no hostilitj^ towards the King as such, but
they considered that the best solution was to depose him, as he washostile to the Allies. He considered that this operation could becarried out with practically no bloodshed by the 1st June, and that,as far as he was concerned, he far preferred to see civil war in Greecethan a united Greece hostile to us. He stated that Thessaly onlywaited the signal to join M. Venizelos, and that even in Athens a partyfriendly to M. Venizelos was gradually gaining ground.The advantage of this solution, in the opinion of the FrenchGovernment, is that the forces at present in Macedonia will have allGreece to retire upon instead of only Salonica, and that the allied forces could gradually and fairly rapidly be replaced by Venizelisttroops with only a very small support of Allied troops.He considered that the comparatively small danger of this operation should be run at once, rather than run later the extremelygrave danger of the Allies being beleaguered in Salonica.M. Painleve added that the beat answer to the British contentions-tion that the maritime situation demanded the evacuation of Salonica.was the one above described, when the Allies could gradually with-draw practically all their troops through a friendly Greece.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegram fromGeneral Milne, in which it was stated that General Sarrail hadtemporarily suspended the offensive against Bulgaria, one of thereasons given being that he wished to release troops for operations in Thessaly.A discussion took place on the general question of thedesirability of an invasion of Greece, as contemplated by the French.Lord Derby stated that M. Hibot had insisted strongly that hisGovernment could not exist unless drastic action on these lines was.taken. In favour of the French proposals it was urged that publicopinion in this country is very pronounced on this subject, andfurther evidence was produced by Lord Derby of a widely prevalentbelief in the North of England that the King is in some wayconnected with the maintenance of King Constantine on his throne.It was suggested that, if the British Government were to oppose theadoption of the French policy, these unfounded rumours would be greatly strengthened and might become a serious factor.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the French, ever since General JofFie&apos;s visit in October, 1915, had constantly used the argument that their Government was in danger, in order to carry us with them in their Salonica policy, and that we were under no special obligation to support the present French Ministry. some doubts also were expressed as to the importance of the feeling in thiscountry against King Constantine, and in this connection lord robert Cecil pointed out that his statement of British policy in greece, which contained no threats to King Constantine, had been well received by the House of Commons in Secret Session, and hadprovoked no questions afterwards. Considerable doubts were expressed as to the bona fides of the French intentions, which werecharacterised by Lord Robert Cecil as inspired by a desire to achieve a cheap military success for purely political purposes.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff apprehended that the invasion of Greece might involve a very considerable military comniit-ment. He pointed out the inconsistency of the French attitude,which represented the Greek Army as contemptible and negligiblewhen the invasion of Greece was under consideration, but as a formidable threat to the communications of the Allied Forces at salonica. In this connection it was suggested that, in conjunctionwith a Bulgarian force attacking Salonica, the Greek Army wouldbe a serious factor. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointedout that the actual plan contemplated by General Sarrail wouldinvolve the provision of a great deal of shipping, and that he was strongly opposed to undertaking military operations against Greece.The First Sea Lord pointed out that we could provide noshipping for an operation against Greeee.     The French were already
demanding more shipping to supply coal to their Fleet, and, even ifthey undertook to transport the forces required for General Sarrau7j%plan, they would demand more shipping from us for other purposes,so that ultimately the burden would fall on us. He considered thatthe French exaggerated the threat to the maritime communicationsof the Salonica Ai&apos;my or the possible establishment by the enemy of submarine bases in Greek harbours.The War Cabinet were agreed that the shipping situationabsolutely precluded us from participating in the French proposals,or from modifying our declared policy in regard to the reduction ofour forces at Salonica, particularly in view of the unanimousdeclaration of the Naval and Military Advisers of the British andFrench Govern tnente at Paris on the 5th May that &quot; the militarysituation is entirely dominated by the question of shipping.&quot; .No agreement was reached, however, as to whether we ought to acquiesce in a French invasion of Greece. One view was that itwould be a serious tactical mistake, for reasons already given, tobuttress up King Constantine, and that the Government would incura very serious responsibility if it adopted a policy which could berepresented as having this effect. On the other hand, enquiry wasmade as to the reasons which could be given publicly to explain thechange in policy. It was pointed out that at Paris a definite policy had been agreed upon comprising the purchase and control of theThessalian harvest in return for a raising of the blockade, and theFrench Government had undertaken to instruct General Sarrail tocarry out the establishment of the military control posts in the mostpacific and friendly manner possible, and to do all in his power toavoid civil strife. Both in the Conference and in private conversationthe French representatives had repudiated any hostile intentionsagainst Greece. King Constantine, whatever might be his realfeelings towards the Entente Powers, had carried out his undertakings,and had lately installed a vvo-Entente Prime Minister. What new factor, it was asked, had arisen which would justify an act of war against Greece ?The War Cabinet decided that In order to ascertain the grounds on which the French Govern-ment proposed to justify to the world their change in policy a meeting of the two Governments should take place,and the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was authorised to invite M. Bibot and his military advisers tocome to London to discuss the question.The Mahsuds. 8. The Secretary of State for India stated that, owing to therecent hostile and increasing activities of the Mahsud Tribe on theNorth-West Frontier, the Government of India, after carefulconsideration of the situation and. with due recognition of their largecommitments to the Empire, had reluctantly been forced to theconclusion that the present policy of passive defence was no longertenable. An effective demonstration of our power to keep order onour frontiers and to take punitive measures when necessary was, intheir opinion, required in order to prevent further extensions of thepresent trouble. Various attacks had been made during the lastweeks against our troops, which had incurred considerable casualties,and the cumulative.effect of these might react disastrously all along the border. Mr. Chamberlain briefly recapitulated the military action proposed by the Government of India (Viceroy&apos;s telegram,dated the 21st May, 1917, Paper G.T.-802) (Appendix I).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the present was a highly inconvenient time for operations which would lock up in^India troops required for other theatres of war.   He was, however,disposed to think that vigorous action now might have a salutary effect, and check the spread of what might conceivably lead to a
general conflagration on the frontier, and was not prepared to question the action that the Indian Government proposed to take.In the course of the discussion it was pointed out that the real question at issue was, what subsequent action of an administrative, nature would be required on the completion of the military opera-tions ? It was impossible to forecast whether punitive action orcontinued passivity were the more likely to set the frontier ablaze.The Mahsuds were, in some ways, a tribe apart, very turbulent,restless, and impatient of the authority of their own Headmen. Itwas unquestionable that sooner or later an example would have tobe made of them, and this had long been recognised by the indian government. The present moment was, unfortunately, inopportune,and the Indian Government had not, so far, indicated whether theycontemplated taking over the administration of the country. Variousattempts in the past, by means of blockades and swift punitiveexpeditions, had been made to cope with the difficulty without success. The occupation and control of the territory would alonesettle the problem, and to attempt this during the war was tooextensive a commitment,The War Cabinet decided To leave the decision as to the action to be taken to the indian government, whilst asking them for further information on some points. The War Cabinet authorised the Secre-tary of State for India to despatch to the Indian Govern-ment the telegram reproduced in Appendix II.Salonica and 9. In regard to a further telegram from General Milne, pointingGreece. out that the Serbians had already obtained sure knowledge of theforthcoming withdrawal of certain British forces from Salonica, theWar Cabinet decided To adhere to their decision of the previous day (War Cabinet 142,Minute 11), that no communication should be made to theSerbian Government pending the arrival of AdmiralTroubridge, whom the Admiralty have already recalled.T.B.D. &quot; Red-gauntlet.&quot;10. The First Sea Lord reported that the destroyergauntlet&quot; had struck a mine and had been damaged.Red-Submarines.11. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that aspecial service decoy ship had been sunk by an enemy submarine inthe Atlantic?, and, as onlyj;a few of the crew had so far been picked up, it was feared that considerable casualties had resulted.Shipping Losses. 12. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that theshipping losses for May, up to the 20th instant inclusive, were : British ... 105 ships of 239,616 tons.Allies ... 36     ,,        o.*,525    ,,Neutrals ... 44     ,,        6o,842   ,,Making a sum total of 185     ,,      362,183   ,,^ which worked out at the rate of British, 320,000 tons a month,With a sum total of, sa), 500,000 tons a month.[1365-144]   . D
The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that the Germansclaimed that 2,770,000 tons of shipping had been sunk by them, but ^that the actual figure should be 1,929,000 tons, and that the^*;German figures for March and April exceeded the actual sinkings for february, March, and April. The First Sea Lord asked whether itwas desirable that these discrepancies should be pointed out, but theWar Cabinet decided that No action should be taken in that respect, but that a fairlyoptimistic general statement should be made in the Houseof Commons.PortugueseContingent forPrance.13. With reference to War Cabinet 138, Minute 7, the, ^ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he, in the presenceof the First Sea Lord, had interviewed the Portuguese Minister forWar, and had informed him that no troops, other than those already arranged for, could be taken from Portugal for the Western front.The First Sea Lord stated that he had promised two destroyersto act as escort to the transports appi^opriated for the conveyance of the balance of the Portuguese contingent.Prohibition of 14. The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the question of horse-racing. ^he prohibition of horse-racing with reference to their decision as expressed in War Cabinet 127, Minute 3, and decided To request the Prime Minister, after his interview this afternoonwith representatives of the Jockey Club, to bring thematter before the War Cabinet for final decision.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 23, 1917.
APPENDIX I.*(G.T.-802.) -Telegram dated May 21, 1917, from Viceroy of India to Secretary of State for India.(Secret.   Mahsuds.)1. AFTER carefully reconsidering Mahsud situation, we are forced to conclusionthat present policy of passive defence is no longer tenable. Hostile sections arehopelessly committed, and their successes against our troops have reacted seriously on neutral sections, and also probably on Darwesh Khel Waziris. Unless we can demon-strate our power to hit back effectively, we may be confronted with general risingbetween Kurram and Gonral Rivers with danger of further extensions. Successfulreprisals offer only hope of suppressing hostile sections and keeping others from joining.Situation has also assumed military character which presents following factors : 2. (a.) We estimate Mahsud armed strength at 11,450, with 333 magazine rifles and 3,349 breach-loading rifles.(6.) Present position is that southern Mahsuds have barred our lines of communi-cation, well supported by Gwaleri Pass to Kajari Kach, Wana, andSarwekai. Immediateoperations are necessary to provision and stock&apos;these posts.(c.) Their evacuation would be impossible on both political and military grounds. It would open our protected districts of Derajat and Zhob to Mahsudincursions, and thereby necessitate a considerable increase in permanent garrisons ofthose areas.(d.) For the purpose of retaliation, an accessible and suitable objective in southernWaziristari is the cultivated Khaisora Valley, inhabited by most hostile section, situated12 to 14 miles from Wana.(e.) We have accordingly approved of plan for concentrating two brigades withtwelve guns and two companies sappers at Wana for this purpose, holding lines ofcommunication, the posts, and the Derajat with one and a half regiments cavalry, and six battalions in addition to the militia. Bannu garrison will be reinforced by two battalions so as to be ready for eventualities. One battalion pioneers will be employedon road-making in Gomal; and another, assisted by tribal labour, in the Tochi.The above troops, together with existing Bannu Brigade, constituting WaziristanField Force, under the immediate command of General Benyon, who reports to GeneralOfficer Commanding, Northern Army.  (/.) Operations for the reopening of the lines of communication are now in progress,and we estimate that by the 20th June the two brigades should be concentrated atWana in readiness to strike, and we hope to complete operations before the Id, whichfalls about 31st July, thus taking advantage of tribal inertia during Ramazan. At thesame time we feel we cannot prudently reckon on reducing Waziristan Field Forcebefore September, and that is the reason we have obtained battalions destined for EastAfrica and Egypt.3. We fully realise our larger commitments to the Empire and necessity forfulfilling these, and would gladly avoid this diversion were it practicable. But we arereluctantly forced to face fact that a passive defence is no longer possible, and that proposed punitive measures alone offer some hope of bringing Mashuds to their senses,and prevent spread of trouble.APPENDIX II.(G.T.-820.) __Telegram approved by the- War Cabinet to be sent to the Viceroy of India.(Foreign Secret.)YOUR telegram of 21st May : Mashuds.I appreciate risk that merely passive defence may cause extension of trouble Onthe other hand, precedent of 1897 shows that offensive operations may produce thesame effect.   Of relative magnitude of these two risks you and your advisers are best
judges, and if, while bearing in mind considerations stated in your last paragraph, youare clearly of opinion that active operations offer best chance of security, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will accept your view.    But please let me know 1. What terms of peace you contemplate imposing ? Is it possible without operations on more extended scale than is possible at present time to secure a permanent settlement ?2. What you propose if operations do not have effect you expect ?3. What communication you propose to make to Amir in view of your recentcorrespondence with him ?4. Whether you consider any special measures necessary to steady the Afridis ?
