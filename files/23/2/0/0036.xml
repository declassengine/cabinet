1. THE Prime Minister read a telegram he had received fromMr. Samuel Gompers, the American Labour Leader, stating that hehad been appointed a member of the Advisory Commission ofthe Council of National Defence, whose special service is thd5conservation and welfare of workers and effective industrial service,asking for the advice of representatives of the workers of thiscountry, and urging that Messrs. Appleton and Bowerman shouldbe sent as members of the British Commission. It was also men-tioned in the telegram that Mr. Gompers had sent a correspondingtelegram to the Erench Government.The War Cabinet decided that A reply should be sent to Mr. Gompers informing him thatrepresentative British workers would be sent as soon aspossible. The opinion was expressed that it was highlyinadvisable to withdraw Mr. Appleton from his work asLabour Adviser to the Ministry of National Service at thepresent time.Mr. Henderson was authorised to invite Mr. Bowerman andone other Labour representative to join the British mission, and inaddition a representative with knowledge of Welfare work, who should he nominated, after consultation with Dr. Addison.EuBsia. 2. The Prime Minister read a telegram from M. Miliukoff,communicated to him by M. Nabukoff, containing somewhatreassuring anticipations in regard to the Russian internal andmilitary situation.3. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 2, Minute 5,where is recorded the decision that the Czar should be invited totake up his residence in this country, it was brought to the attentionof the War Cabinet by the Prime Minister that there was a strong feeling hostile to the Czar in certain working-class circles in thiscountry, and that articles tending to associate the King with the Czarhad appeared in the Press ; it was felt that, if the Czar should take up his residence here, there was a danger that these tendencies mightbe stimulated and accentuated. It was further pointed out that, inthe event of any differences of opinion between the British and RussianGovernments, there would be a tendency in Russia to attribute our attitude to the Czar&apos;s presence. In these circumstances it wassuggested that the South of France, or even Spain (but only in theevent of Spain joining the Allies), might be a more suitable place of residence, if the Czar should be permitted to leave Russia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was authorised to telegraph these considerations to the British ambassador at Petrograd, and to invite his opinion. Sir GeorgeBuchanan should be instructed to make no communication to the Russian Government on the subject.Eoumania. 4. With reference to War Cabinet 113, Minute 18, the secretary reported that the Roumanian Minister continued to send letters tothe Prime Minister asking for great quantities of heavy ordnanceand ammunition. He asked for instructions as to the nature of the reply to be sent.The War Cabinet decided that- . .The Secretary should communicate with the roumanian minister in the sense that, before any great programmesuch as he had put forward could be considered, it wouldbe necessary for the Roumanian Government to come to a clear understanding with the Russian Government inregard to the necessary transport.The United Statesof-America:Labour representatives-tion on theBritish Mission.
The Policy of  Th 5. The War Cabinet decided that a Sub-Committee, composedClean Slate.&quot; aR f0H0WS :-Sir PI. Babington Smith (Chairman),Representatives of the Foreign Office,,, ,,     Colonial Office,,        ,,     India Office,,, ,,     Board of Trade,  -Captain Clement Jones (Secretary),should meet at once to consider The policy (with respect, in due course, to proposals of peace)of the &quot; Clean Slate,&quot; i.e.: of barring, in the eventual Treatyof Peace, all claims of enemy Governments, on behalf of themselves or of individuals, against British governments or British subjects arising out of any act of a BritishGovernment done during the war, or on annexation of enemy territory;and should report without delay to the Imperial War Cabinet.Labour Grievances 6. With reference to War Cabinet 115, Minute 9, the Warand Sedition. Cabinet decided that-Lord Milner and Mr. Henderson, in concert with the Ministerof Labour, should investigate the labour grievances andthe seditious tendencies referred to by the Prime minister on the 6th April, and should, on behalf of the War Cabinet,take such measures as they thought fit, in conjunction withthe Conciliation Department of the Ministry of Labour, andshould also deal with the reconstruction of the Committeeon Production on the lines suggested by Mr. Henderson inhis memorandum to the Prime Minister.Timber Supplies. 7- with reference to War Cabinet 116, Minute 1, the WarCabinet decided To ask the Secretary of State for War for a written report onthe timber position.Maximum Prices 8. The War Cabinet reviewed their decision with regard to for Wheat, Barley, maximum prices for wheat, barley, and oats, set forth in Minute 3and Uats. of w&amp;r Cabinet mIt was pointed out by the agricultural experts present that, inview of the high price for oats now being obtained, there was danger that the proposed price of 48s. per 312 lb. would lead farmers tofeed the oats to stock, instead of selling to millers for conversion into meal. At 48s. it would be more profitable to turn the oats intomeat. On the other hand, if this were made a penal offence, itwould irritate the farmer at the moment when it was most desirableto encourage him to proceed with tillage.In view of the fresh considerations urged by the President ofthe Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and with the concurrence of the Food Controller, the War Cabinet decided Not to disturb the maximum prices fixed for wheat and barley,but to raise the maximum price for home-grown oats to55s. per 312 lb.
Food Supplies. 9. The War Cabinet considered the present and prospective-position of the food supplies of the country, in the light of the entry of the United States into the war.Lord Devonport again referred to the decline in the wheat and*flour stocks in the country from fourteen weeks&apos; supply in december last to nine weeks&apos; supply at the present time.The Shipping Controller stated that, in his opinion, there wasa reasonable hope that the position might improve, but, owing tothe submarine toll of tonnage, it was very difficult to form anestimate.The War Cabinet urged upon, the Shipping Controller theimportance of inducing the United States G-overnment to ship asmuch wheat as possible at the earliest moment.The Shipping Controller farther stated that more ships hadbeen diverted from the East and other trades to United States portsthan could be loaded promptly, owing to lack of wheat at sea board.Further, there was congestion on the quays partly due to the lack ofco-ordination between the buying and shipping arrangements of theAllies. The Shipping Controller stated that Mr. Alan Anderson, ofthe Wheat Commission, who is fully conversant with the facts, is onhis way to the United States and has been instructed to deal withthe situation on the spot.(Initialled) D.
