WITH reference to War Cabinet 151, Minute 7, the PrimeMinister stated that he had invited Lord Northcliffe to proceed tothe United States as the head of a Mission representing the various departments concerned with supplies derived from that country,with a view to co-ordinating their action and to prevent anyoverlapping, and that Lord Northcliffe had accepted the appointment and was anxious to start with the least possible delay.[1365-152]B
The War Cabinet agreed that it was desirable that LordNprthcliffe, before leaving England, should interview and consult the heads of the above Departments, viz. : The Admiralty,The War Office,The Treasury,The Ministry of Munitions,The Ministry of Shipping,The Ministry of Food,The Colonial Office, andThe Air Board.The Secretary to the War Cabinet was further directed toprepare, for the approval of the War Cabinet, draft instructions which should be handed to Lord Northcliffeas a general guide for the purposes of his Mission.It was understood that the Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs would send a personal telegram to the British ambassador at Washington announcing the appointment of Lord Northcliffe.American troops for the western front.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed theWar Cabinet that General Pershing, who had been appointedCommander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Force for theWestern Front, had notified him that, under instructions fromhis Government, he would shortly be proceeding to Englandaccompanied by 53 officers, with some 70 rank and file and clerical staff, in order to confer with the British Military Authorities andto make all necessary preliminary arrangements for the advent ofthe first Contingent of the above Force.Russia. 3. The  Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thattelegrams from General Knox in regard to the military situationin Russia continued to be pessimistic. As previously stated byhim to the War Cabinet, however, although General Knox had never erred on the side of optimism, his information in the longrun generally proved to be accurate. General Robertson statedthat Russian deserters before the Revolution had amounted to2,000,000, and that since the Revolution this number had beendoubled, and that so far only 100,000 had returned to the Colours.He had also received a telegram from General Barter, who hadtaken over the duties of General Hanbury-Wilhams, to the effectthat a letter had been received by General Alexeieff from PrinceLeopold of Bavaria, containing tentative suggestions with a viewto a separate peace, and that General Alexeieff was not proposing to send any reply. Prince Leopolds letter, apparently, did notspecify any conditions of peace.Portugal.(i.) Contingent for france.(ii.) Carriers for german EastAfrica.4. With reference to War Cabinet 138, Minute 7, the Secretaryof State for War said that the Portuguese War Minister was nowin London, and was very anxious to have an interview with thePrime Minister in order to discuss personally with him the questionof the transport of Portuguese troops for service on the western front. Lord Derby pointed out that it would not be possible, inpresent circumstances, to hold out any hopes of reversing in thenear future the decision of the War Cabinet in regard to thissubject; but that if Mr. Lloyd George would consent to see theMinister he might use his influence to get him to induce his Govern-ment to permit the enrolment of some 20,000 carriers in PortugueseEast Africa, whose services were urgently required in connectionwith the completion of our operations in German East Africa.
A Polish Porce fornjhe Western Pront.mercantile shipping Losses.6. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff made the usual state-ment of mercantile shipping casualties. He stated that the lossesduring the last two days had again assumed serious proportions.He further informed the War Cabinet that an armed trawlerhad been sunk the previous day by a mine off Queenstown.2 i. 2Bombardment of 7. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that on the cape Helles. . 28th instant certain British monitors had bombarded Cape Helles,with a view to placing out of action certain 8-inch guns which theTurks had mounted there.Salonica.8. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that on the29th instant enemy aircraft had bombarded Salonica Harbour, butthat no damage had been caused.German 9. The Prime Minister referred to Foreign Office telegramSubmarines. (No. 406 from Sir H. Rumbold, Berne) giving an account of a recent meeting of the Budget Committee of the Reichstag, in whichthe pre-war naval policy of the German Government had been severely criticised by a National Liberal deputy, whose action indisclosing naval secrets had been strongly condemned by Admiralvon Capelle. The deputy had explained that there are three classesof German submarines ; that, since the commencement of. the war,Germany had despatched 75&apos; large submarines of class A for operations on the high seas; that the German Admiralty had learned of the loss of 6 of the above, but were uncertain whether their losses of vessels of this class might not be considerably greater ; that 100 submarines of small type had been commissioned for use in the straits of the Adriatic and the Bosphorus, &amp;c. ; that70 submarines of an inferior class had also been used for mine-laying ; he had concluded by deprecating excessive optimism.The Prime Minister invited the War Cabinet to compare this information with that given by the First Sea Lord on the 25th instant(War Cabinet 147, Minute 6), which presented a more favourablesituation from the enemy&apos;s point of view.The Deputy Chief of the ISiaval Staff thought that the informa-tion received from Berne was fairly correct. The information atthe disposal of the A dmiralty confirmed the statement of the deputyin the Reichstag that it took 14 months to construct a submarine ofthe first class.The Malay States :&apos;    The EubberIndustry.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (paper g.T.-673) (Appendix I), by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,indicating the importance of maintaining British control of the rubber-growing industry in the Federated Malay States, and thedanger of allowing foreign capitalists to take unfair advantage of5. The Secretary of State for War reported that the french military Authorities were very anxious to raise a separate force of poles in France. For this purpose they had requested that steps might he taken to release all Poles at present serving in british units. Lord Derby said that his advisers were opposed to this project, and that in any case it was unlikely that the Poles them-selves would consent to go. He intended, therefore, to inform theFrench Government that his advisers perceived many objections tothe raising of this force on the lines indicated, and that consequentlyhe was not prepared to adopt their suggestion.The War Cabinet approved the action proposed by Lord Derby.
the restrictions as to the issue of new capital imposed on british companies, to alter the present status of that industry. TheMemorandum drew attention to the increasing importance of rubber,. -as a raw material, and pointed out that for many years past it b^adbeen the settled policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist uponBritish control of companies exploiting oilfields in British Colonies.Mr. Long said that he had been much impressed with the argument that, whereas British Companies cannot extend their operations while the capital restrictions are in force, American and japanese Companies are free to invest their war-profits in rubberplantations, and so to secure a firm footing in the rubber-growingindustry. He said that, as a temporary war measure, he had instructed the Colonial Authorities not to dispose of any area of rubber land exceeding 50 acres to persons who are not Britishsubjects. He asked the War Cabinet formally to approve of these instructions, and also to authorise him to permit such concessions tolocal non-British Asiatics being made as the local authorities coulddevise, and to suspend for the period of the War the transfer ofBritish estates to aliens.In the course of the discussion certain fears were expressed that possibly our Allies and those associated with us in the War, inparticular Japan and the United States of America, might resent the suggested imposition of these restrictions upon the commercialenterprise of their citizens.After consideration, the War Cabinet were inclined to the viewthat any protests that might be lodged by our Allies were not likelyto be other than of a formal character, and they accordingly approved the instructions issued by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Ireland.Composition andFormation of theConvention.11. With reference to War Cabinet 145, Minute 10, the WarCabinet further discussed the composition of and terms of referenceto the Irish Convention (Appendices II and III).Professor Adams stated that Mr. T. P. 0&apos;Connor had receivedmessages from Mr. Redmond and Mr. Dillon offering no objection tothe scheme for a Convention of 101 members.Mr. Duke stated that Mr. Dillon&apos;s letter to Mr. T. P. 0&apos;Connorseemed to imply that the selection of the nominated element wouldbe made by the political parties.The War Cabinet agreed that this was not the intention, butthat the nominations would be made by themselvesRepresentatives ofProtestantChurches.12. The War Cabinet decided that the representatives of the protestant Churches should be the Primate (Dr. Crozier) and the archbishop of Dublin (Dr. Bernard), representing the Church ofIreland, and the Moderator of the General Assembly, representingthe Presbyterian Church of Ireland.Representatives ofLabour.13. The War Cabinet decided that there should be threerepresentatives of the leading Trades Unions in the north of Irelandand a representative from each of the Trades Councils of Dublinand Cork.Chairman of theConvention.14. The War Cabinet had before&apos; them several names suggested as suitable for the chairmanship of the Convention, and after careful consideration decided to invite, in the first instance, the speaker of the House of Commons to undertake the task. ft
Terms of 17. The War Cabinet decided that the following passage from reference. the Prime Ministers letter of 16th May, 1917, should form the termsof reference to the convention : &quot; Would it be too much to hope that Irishmen of all creedsand parties might meet together in a Convention for the purposeof drafting a Constitution for their country which should secure a just balance of all the opposing interests, and finallycompose the unhappy discords which have so long distractedIreland and impeded its harmonious development ? &quot;Communication of 18. The War Cabinet considered hovv the proposals set forth inProposalsto Appendix II, as to the composition, of the Convention, should beUlster, communicated to the Unionists of Ulster.   It was pointed out thatthe Ulster Unionist Council had postponed any decision as to theirentering the Convention pending the receipt of further information from the Government. There were no leaders authorised to act onbehalf of the council ; the leaders were, in fact, pledged to consult the council.&apos;   The difficulty of consulting such a large assembly, and thedanger of hostile criticisms in the press the moment the composition of the Convention became known, were discussed.The War Cabinet decided To request the Chief Secretary for Ireland to transmit to LordMidleton and Sir J. B. Lonsdale the proposed composition of the Convention and the terms of reference, with a viewto consulting the Southern and Ulster Unionists respec-tively.The Chief Secretary was requested to ask that the communica-tion should be treated as strictly confidential, and shouldnot be given to the public.Food Controller :Lord DevonportfsSuccessor.19. In view of the impending resignation of Lord Devonport,the War Cabinet considered possible names for the post of FoodController.   At the request of the Prime Minister Mr. Barnes and Dr. Addison undertook to make enquiries as to suitable men, especially as to the eligibility of certainbusiness leaders of the co-operative wholesale movement.Prisoners of War.20. The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat it had been proposed to him by Lord Newton that in accordancewith a suggestion made some months ago by General Friedrichs,the German official in charge of the Department dealing withprisoners of war, it might be desirable to arrange a meeting between German and British representatives in Holland, with theobject of discussing various questions connected with prisoners ofwar. Various efforts had been made to secure improvements throughneutral channels without success. Lord Newton thought that,conceivably, direct personal representations might succeed in some slight degree, at any rate where diplomatic action through a third party had failed. - If the War Cabinet approved, he was preparedto undertake the Mission himself.Secretary to the 15. The War Cabinet   decided to ask the Right Hon. SirConvention. Francis J. S. Hopwood, G.C.B., G.C.M.G.&apos;, to act as secretary to theg\. Convention.Place of Meeting. 16. The War Cabinet decided that the Convention should meet in Ireland.
In the course of the discussion which followed, it was pointedout that, on the one hand, such, action might arouse the suspicion^^of our Allies, notably the Russians, and be construed as a tentativepeace move with a&apos; view to opening up negotiations ; and, further, itmight only result in harsher treatment being meted out; on theother hand, similar action had already been taken by the French,while it was suggested that existing conditions could hardly be mademuch worse.The War Cabinet decided that There was no objection to the course suggested by&quot;Lord Newton,provided (a.) That full publicity were given to the objects ofthe Mission should the necessary arrangementsprove to be feasible ;(&amp;) That  Lord  Newton were  accompanied by a responsible official of the Prisoners of war department of the War Office.They authorised the Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs accordingly to take the necessary preliminary action,and instructed him to report the result to them in due course.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 31, 1917.

A.May 31, 1917.APPENDIX III.G.T.-673.---Malay States Rubber Industry.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Colonies.REPRESENTATIONS have been made to me as to the importance of maintainingBritish control of the rubber growing industry in the Federated Malay States, and thedanger of aUowing foreign capitalists to take unfair advantage of the restrictions as tothe issue of new capital imposed on British companies to alter the present status ofthat industry. The export of rubber from the Malay States in 1916 was 62,765 tons.It is estimated that the land already alienated in British Malaya is capable of producing 420,000 tons annually. It is also estimated that some 4,390,000 acres of rubber land exists in the Federated Malay States, though much of this is not easilyaccessible at present. Exclusive of small holdings, the area already alienated forrubber cultivation is more than 900,000 acres.In view of the increasing importance of rubber as a raw material, and thetendency of British manufacturers (e.g., the Dunlop Company) to acquire land forrubber growing in order to be independent of the middleman, I think that thisquestion will require serious consideration at the end of the war. It is understoodthat the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy will make recommendations on the general question of restrictions on aliens holding land in British territory. TheCommittee have asked me to abstain from any action which might create a precedent in regard to rubber until the whole policy has been considered, as they are impressed with the danger of retaliation. It is understood that they have in mind especially theiron-ore mines in Spain.It has for many years past been the settled policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist upon British control of companies exploiting oilfields in British Colonies. Atthe request of the Admiralty, the Colonial Office has adopted the same policy in regardto the bauxite deposits which have attracted attention since the war began. british control has also been insisted upon in the case of companies exploiting other rawmaterials in the Colonies in isolated instances. Since the war instructions have beengiven in India that no prospecting licence or mining lease of any mineral whatever isto be granted to an alien. The Government of India have also forbidden the transferof existing concessions without their leave.In these circumstances the question of setting a precedent would seem not to arise in regard to the Malay States rubber industry. The Empire is full of precedents.I have, however, no desire to prejudge the general issue, and even so far as the Malayanrubber industry is - concerned, I do not propose to take any decision as to permanentpolicy until the Industrial Policy Committee&apos;s recommendations have been received and considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government. I only propose a temporary war measuredesigned to preserve the status quo, and to prevent the final decision being taken outof the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government by the march of events before there hasbeen time to examine the whole question properly and arrive at a considered decision.I am much impressed with the argument that British companies cannot extend their operations while the capital restrictions are in force, but that American and japanese companies are free to invest their war profits in rubber plantations and so tosecure a firm footing in the rubber-growing industry. It is obvious that if, at the endof the war, a large area of rubber land in the Federated Malay States had passed under
foreign control, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be free to adopt whichever policycommended itself to them, but would have .to be content with reserving the less^accessible lands for British interests if they decided upon enforcing British control of rubber growing.In these circumstances, I have instructed the Colonial authorities not to dispose ofany area of rubber land exceeding 50 acres to persons who are not British subjects(the limit has been fixed at 50 acres in order to allow foreign Malays and other Asiaticsto acquire small holdings). It appears to me that this measure is necessary in orderto preserve the status quo pending a final decision as to the policy to be adoptedpermanently, and, as at present advised, I am disposed to adhere to my instructions for the period of the war, and, as a necessary consequence, to prohibit temporarily thetransfer of estates now in British hands to foreign corporations or individuals.It is not to be expected that a measure of this kind will not cause protest frominterested quarters. The American General Rubber Company has withdrawn its application, which originally drew attention to this question, and on which the LondonRubber Growers&apos; Association made representations to the Colonial Office. TheJapanese Ambassador has lodged a protest against any restriction upon Japanesesubjects. And the Colonial Government have represented that the Chinese communitywhich is interested in rubber as well as in mining resents the restrictions imposed.It should be observed that the Colonial authorities, looking at the matter from thelocal point of view, are apprehensive that sufficient British capital may not be forth-coming to develop the Malay States after the war, and are anxious to attract foreign capital for that purpose. They are also apprehensive that any measure of restrictionmay be looked upon as directed against Asiatics. They propose to set apart large areasof rubber land, which will not he alienated without sanction, and, having done so,they wish to apply the restrictions to British as well as to foreign subjects. If noother measure or restriction were considered possible, I should prefer to adopt thispolicy rather than to allow foreign capitalists to alter the existing status of the industry during the war. But the policy of preserving British control over the rubber-growing industry has the support of the Board of Trade and of the chairman ofthe Rubber and Tin -Exports Committee, and I recommend that my instructions be adhered to for the j^period of the war, with such concessions to local non-British Asiaticsas the local authorities can devise, and that the transfer of British estates to aliens be suspended also for the period of the war.Apart from the other considerations mentioned above, it appears to me that towithdraw my instructions to the Colonial Government in consequence of pressure byinterested parties would prejudice the ultimate decision as regards rubber, and makeit more difficult to maintain the British control policy in regard to other raw materials in respect of which it is a matter of settled policy. Futher, I fear that a reversal ofpolicy in the Malay States might gravely compromise the position of the&apos; Governmentof India ; and if the Cabinet on the information now before them hesitate to approve the measures I have taken I would suggest that the India Office should be consulted before a final decision is taken. The preservation of the status quo, and the protectionof British interests during the period of restriction due to the war are in themselvessuch reasonable measures that 1 confidently anticipate the approval of the Cabinet.W.
