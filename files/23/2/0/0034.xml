THE Secretary of State for War asked that the approval ofthe War Cabinet might be accorded to the following proposal:That a Committee should be formed, on which all the Govern-ment Departments using timber are represented ; that each department should give an estimate sis weeks ahead of what their probable requirements are, and that allotments should be madeto them proportionately to the amount of timber which can be imported.Lord Derby stated that he had approached the Heads of Depart-in ents privately on the subject, that they had all agreed to thescheme, and that what he now asked for was the consent of the WarCabinet to a scheme under which all Departments for whom, or for whose contractors, timber is obtained from abroad, should intimateto the Director of Timber Supplies their requirements month bymonth, classed according to the countries of origin ; the Director of timber Supplies would - then compare the totals with the tonnage which can be allotted for the conveyance of timber from each country, and, in communication with the Consultative Committee,should reduce the requirements, as and when this may be necessary,,[1365-116] B
in order to bring them within the carrying capacity of the shippingthat can be spared for timber (Appendix I). The War cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should, in the first instance,obtain the Departmental estimates for timber requirements,and submit them to the War Cabinet, who would then re-consider Lord Derby&apos;s proposals.Forestry.2. The Secretary of State for War stated that, in regard to thequestion of the provision of labour for forestry in this country, hewas confronted with the difficulty that men obtained by voluntaryenlistment for such service would almost certainly be taken from agriculture. He informed the War Cabinet that the MilitaryAuthorities had carried out to the fullest possible extent theinstructions of the War Cabinet to give temporary assistance to agriculture, and that the Army had lent no less than 36,295 men for employment on the land. He proposed, for the War Cabinet&apos;ssanction, that he should consult with the Field-Marshal commanding the Home Forces as to whether a certain number, say 5,000 to 10,000,of these men should not be employed in forestry during the summer months (Appendix I).The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for War, in concert with Lord French,to divert to forestry, instead of returning to the Army, a proportion of the men lent temporarily by the Army to agriculture, who would otherwise return very shortly to military duty.The WesternFrontrJThe EeeentOperations.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained on a mapthe scope of the operations now in progress in the Arras region, inwhich the troops engaged had achieved the whole of the objectivesassigned to them many weeks ago. The number of enemy prisonersnow exceeded 9,000, and in places the Hindenburg line had beenpierced. He explained the strategical function of this particularattack in the general scheme of operations, and he further statedthat the heavy aeroplane fighting the previous week had been a prelude to the carrying out of these operations, which, in his opinion,would not have had so satisfactory an issue had it not been for our success in these aerial combats.The War Cabinet authorised The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to send a telegram, ontheir behalf, to congratulate Field-Marshal Sir douglas haig on his great achievement, and to invite him to congratulate the Commanders and the troops concerned.Enemy Movements. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that two additional German Divisions from the Russian Front and one newDivision had been located on the Western Front, making a grandtotal of 151, as compared with 119 confronting us at the commence-ment of the operations on the Somme. He reminded the WarCabinet that, although the amount of artillery had, in consequenceof the formation of new units, been considerably increased, the infantry had not been increased in full proportion to the number ofadditional divisions, the estimated number of rifles now opposing uson this Front being probably about 100,000 greater than it was onthe 1st July last.
A Landing Behind 5. With reference to War Cabinet 101, Minute 12, the Chief ofthe Allied Lme. t^e Imperial General Staff reported that General Nivelle had visited the coastal district in. rear of the extreme left of the Allied Front,and had sent an additional French Division to reinforce the troopsalready in that region. The view of the General Staff was that theenemy would be ill-advised to undertake a landing on this coast,except in conjunction with a heavy attack by land across the Frenchand Belgian Fronts, and that for the time being such an attack isnot possible, owing to the state of the ground, fn the circumstances,he did not think it necessary to advise that any special preparations should be made to meet this attack,-and the War Cabinet concurredthat no further action at present was required.Mesopotamia. , fl. The Chief of the Imperial   General Staff  reported thatGeneral Maude had withdrawn somewhat to the south, on the Diala,and was devoting his attention for the present to the 18th TurkishCorps on the Tigris, which he had successfully attacked with satis-factory results. He stated that information received tended toindicate that the Turks might attempt to recapture Baghdad, to the possession of which they attached great importance. Provided thatthe Russians could exercise pressure from the Caucasus, there wasnot much to be apprehended from their efforts, but if, for any reason,Russian co-operation was not forthcoming, we might have to meetthe largest number of Turks that the enemy would be able tosupply. On a rough computation, he thought that this numbermight possibly amount, as an outside estimate, to 200,000 men, ofwhom some 150,000 would be/fighting men. It would, however,take several months before tha^e^ould be reached.Russia. 7. With reference to telegram No. 468 from Petrograd, theWar Cabinet authorised :  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to arrange for atelegram to be sent by Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig toGeneral Alexeief, as suggested by Sir George Buchanan,as well as a telegram from himself, in which, inter alia, heshould mention the urgent importance of Russian co-operation in the Caucasus.Mr. Henderson undertook to make the necessary arrangementsfor the despatch of telegrams from the employes at woolwich Arsenal, and at Vickers Works, as suggested bySir George Buchanan.Submarines. 8. The First Sea Lord reported a number of actions with euemysubmarines, including one definitely sunk by a torpedo, and anumber of more or less doubtful claims. He gave his usual reportof shipping casualties due to enemy submarines.Hospital Ships. 9. The First Sea Lord adverted to the practice recently adoptedby the enemy, of attacking Hospital Ships. He reported that theAdmiralty had great difficulty in providing adequate escort for such ships in the English Channel, and he stated that, in his opinion, itwould be impossible to supply an escort to Hospital Ships in theMediterranean, more especially having regard to the increasinglylarge numbers of sick from Salonica, for whom it would be necessary. to provide transport during the unhealthy summer months.The War Cabinet, without prejudice to the decision to betaken by the Imperial War Cabinet upon the general question of reprisals, and perceiving no alternative to such action as is herebysanctioned, authorised 
The Admiralty to remove hospital ships employed in theChannel service from the list of ships under the protectionof the Hague Convention, and to permit them to sailwithout lights and without distinguishing marks.10. The War Cabinet reconsidered the question of the nationalisation of Shipping (War Cabinet, 46, Minute 12, and WarCabinet, 62, Minute 4). They had under review a Memorandum,dated the 7th April, 1917, by the Shipping Controller (paper g-.T.-393). They agreed that, in the first instance, the above memorandum should be submitted to the Chairman of the Board of inland Revenue for his report.11. The Prime Minister reported that M. Painleve, the french minister of War, had visited him yesterday, and that M. Ribot was expected to-morrow.12. The Prime Minister stated that M. Painleve had appeared todesire that eight divisions (four British and four French) should besent to Italy. The Prime Minister said that, not wishing to commit himself, he had not encouraged M. Painleve in this idea.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff considered that itwould be a mistake to send these divisions to Italy, where general cadorna has all the infantry he wants ; he understood, moreover,that the French military authorities wez-e also opposed to sendingtroops to Italy. The forty howitzers (ten batteries of 6-inch) referredto in War Cabinet, 113, Minute 5, will have gone this week, and, ifthe French, are anxious to render assistance to Italy, their helpshould take the form of field artillery.13. The Prime Minister stated that M. Painleve had told him that the French were sending General Bailloud to command the twoFrench battalions attached to General Murray&apos;s force. M. Painlevehad represented this as a matter of very secondary importance, andhad suggested that he might be made commandant of some smallplace, such as Gaza. The Prime Minister had replied that this was too small a post for so distinguished a General. In this conversationit had been quite clear that M. Painleve&apos;s proposals had ulteriorpolitical designs in the background, their object being to peg outclaims in Palestine.M. Painleve had then suggested complete co-operation in Syria,and that a more considerable French force should be sent. ThePrime Minister, however, had pointed out that we had only quiterecently withdrawn a division from Egypt for service in France, andthat there was no case strategically for bringing further french troops.   The matter should certainly be postponed until the autumn.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff repeated his previousview that French military co-operation was undesirable, and thatunity of command and homogeneity of force were essential.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that theItalians would claim-the same privileges and rights of co-operation as the French. From a political point of view, therefore, it was very undesirable to encourage further French co-operation. The WarCabinet decided that: The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should instruct general sir A. Murray not to permit the French to occupy orgarrison any place of consequence on the lines of com-munication.
Tripoli.14. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theFrench desired to land a division at a point on the Syrian coastbetween Beirut and Alexandretta, but that he strongly deprecatedany isolated enterprise which would make further demands on shipping.15. The Prime Minister reported that he had suggested toM. Painleve the possibility of transferring General Sarrail from Salonica to some high position on another Front. M. Painleve,however, had not appeared to welcome the idea, and had pressed fora vigorous attack from Salonica.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, from apolitical point of view, there was something to be said for leavingGeneral Sarrail in supreme command at Salonica, because we do not wish to be left in charge of a campaign which is in an unsatisfactory state, and might eventually have to be abandoned on account oftransport difficulties.Volo.16. The Prime Minister stated that M. Painleve had informed him that the French were anxious to seize the port of Volo. ThePrime Minister, however, had explained that no good would be gained by taking possession of Volo, because there would be nosaving in shipping. He had told M. Painleve the facts about our shipping position, more particularly in relation to the Salonicaexpedition, and had pointed out the urgent need of developing theoverland route, via Cherbourg and Italy.The BritishEmissary to theUnited States ofAmerica.Assistance fromthe United Statesof America.(a.) Shipping and shipbuilding.17. With reference to War Cabinet 115, Minute 2, in regard tothe forthcoming visit of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the War Cabinet discussed the various forms of assistance which theUnited States Government should be asked to render.At the request of the Cabinet, Mr. Balfour undertook to ask thePresident of the United States for assistance in the following ways (jt^18. Mr. Balfour undertook to call the Presidents attention tothe need of developing to the full the shipbuilding capacity of theUnited States of America, . He will explain to the President thedifficulty of inducing neutral vessels, even by insurance, to keep inour trade, and he will therefore ask the President whether theAmerican vessels now engaged in coastal trade cannot be diverted to the service of the Allies, and their places taken by neutrals.(b.) Troops. 19. In view of the desirability of getting as many troops aspossible for the Western Front in a few months&apos; time, and sometroops immediately in order to show the United States flag and givethe public in the United States of America a definite stake in thewar, Mr. Balfour will ask President Wilson (1.) To send at once a few trained troops from the regulararmy, amounting in numbers to a brigade, or, betterstill, a division, if that be possible.(2.) To train as many troops as possible with a view to having an advanced force to proceed to France in, say, August orSeptember, to occupy a quiet part of the line as part ofthe final stages of its training.(3.) To consider the question of training in the later stages,whether in France or elsewhere. It was agreed that theearly training should be done in the United States ofAmerica, having regard to the difficulties of shipping[1365-116] C
(c) Guns. 20. At the request of the Minister of Munitions, and with theconcurrence of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Mr. Balfourundertook to impress on the United States Government the adoptionof British types of guns, with a view to rapid production, closer -operation, and facility of supply of ammunition..(d.) Wheat. 21. At the request of the Shipping Controller Mr. Balfourundertook to impress on the United States Government theimportance of releasing, for the use of the Allies, all their surplussupplies of wheat. Mr. Balfour will investigate the possibility ofobtaining further supplies of wheat from Canada, consrdting, if need be, Canadian Ministers from Ottawa. Before starting, Mr. Balfourundertook to see the Shipping Controller, Mr. Rogers, the canadian minister of Public Works, and Mr. Anderson, of the wheat commission, together, in order to investigate a statement that thebest possible use was not being made of the Canadian wheatresources owing to our refusal of certain lower grades.(e.) Steel. 22. Mr. Balfour undertook to impress on the United StatesGovernment the importance, with a view to meeting the increasedrequirements due to the formation of their own army, of increasingthe output and reducing civilian demands for steel.Mr. Balfour will point out the desirability of not recruitingsteel and other skilled workers. Dr. Addison undertook to sendMr. Balfour, before his departure, a list of difficulties encounteredand surmounted by the Ministry of Munitions, including labour difficulties.The Irish Question. 23. Mr,  Balfour undertook to make special enquiry, and to telegraph to the War Cabinet, as to the importance of the Irishquestion in connection with our relations with the United States ofAmerica.(Initialled)      &quot;   D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 10, 1917.and food on this side, and that the complete units shouldnot come over until they are, at any rate, partly trained.(4.) To consider whether it will be possible to send any drafts of recruits at once to join (a) British, (b) Canadian,or (c) French units.The War Cabinet realise that this may b*eimpossible, but they regard it as.the most valuable formof assistance that could be given, and one likely to leadto the most rapid conclusion of the war.In addition, Mr. Balfour was authorised to offer every possible assistance in training the new levies in accordance with experience gained in the present war, and he undertook to suggest to the United States Government that advantage might also be taken of French experience.
APPENDIX.Note by the Secretary of State for War on a.) Timber supplies.b.) Trovision of Labour for Forestry in the United Kingdom.1. I SHOULD like the War Cabinet&apos;s consent to certain action with regard to theimport of timber.The Director of Timber Supplies (Sir Bampfylde Fuller) suggested to me certainmethods for dealing with the import of timber. I need not go into detail, but themain point is that timber shall only be imported by - licence ; that a Committee shallbe formed on which representatives of all the Government Departments using timberare represented, and each Department should give an estimate six weeks ahead of what their probable requirements are ; and that allotment shall be made to them propor-tionately to the amount of timber which can be imported.In order to save the War Cabinet the trouble of investigating the matter, I sent a private and circular letter to the heads of Departments, and I am glad to say theyhave all agreed to the scheme.What I ask for now is the consent of the War Cabinet to a scheme under whichall Departments for whom, or for whose contractors, timber is obtained from abroadshould return to the Director of Timber Supplies their requirements month by month,classed according to the countries of origin. He will then compare the totals with thetonnage which the Admiralty can allot for the conveyance of timber from each country,and, in communication with the Consultative Committee, should reduce the require-ments, if this be necessary, in order to bring them within the carrying capacity of theshipping that can be spared for timber.Licences to import would be issued by the Board of Trade for each Department,or its contractors, only within the quantity that had been allotted to it. This willenable the importation of timber to be regulated in such a way as to ensure that itdoes not interfere with the conveyance of foodstuffs and munitions.To prohibit the importation of timber immediately and absolutely would havedisastrous consequences.2. There is a further question which I am dealing with, and that is the provisionof labour for forestry in this country. My difficulty being that the men I should probably get by voluntary enlistment for such service would almost certainly be taken away from Agriculture.In this connection it may be interesting to the War Cabinet to know that theArmy in the shape of ploughmen, agricultural companies, and other measures hasnow got no less than 36,295 men employed on the land, which, I think, conclusivelyshows that the military authorities have carried out to the fullest the instructions ofthe War Cabinet to give temporary assistance to agriculture. Many of these men willbe due to return to their units on the 1st May, though I propose to exercise mydiscretion, if necessary, to leave them a little longer on the land.I would also propose for the. War Cabinefs sanction to consult with Lord french as to whether a certain number of these men -say 5,000 to 10,000 should not beemployed in forestry during the summer months. By the end of the summer I hopethe coloured labour wilLhave come into France, and the demand for more labour forthat country will be at an end, in which case we may be able to find the men they require for the forestry department in the autumn.War Office, April 10, 1917.
