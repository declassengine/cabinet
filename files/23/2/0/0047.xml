May 1917.SECRET.WAR CABINET, 129.Minutes of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held at 10, Downing Street, 8.W., on tuesday, May 1, 1917, at 7 P.M.Present:The Prime Minister (in the Chair).The Right Hon. the Earl  curzon of kedleston, KG., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.The Right Hon. the Viscount Milner,G.C.B., G.C.M.G.The Right Hon. A. Henderson, M.P.The following were also present :-The Right Hon. W. Long, M.P., Secretaryof State for the Colonies.The Right Hon. A. Chamberlain, M.P.,Secretary of State for India.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M. P. A. Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary.Major L. Storr, Assistant Secretary.Captain L. S. Amery, Assistant Secretary.Future Sessions of THE Prime Minister brought before the War Cabinet thethe^ Imperial &quot;War question of the renewal of the system of Imperial War Cabinets in thefuture. He considered that a suggestion to this effect should comefrom the British Cabinet. He had had some discussion with sir robert Borden with regard to the possibility of General Smntsinformally representing the other Dominions on the War Cabinet,and had realised that this would not be feasible. He was generaUyin favour of the proposal for an annual session of the ImperialGabinet set forth in a memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies, but dwished to make it clear that in an emergency aspecial session of the Imperial&apos;Cabinet might be summoned at anytime.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that itwas desirable to fix, normally, a definite period for such sessions inorder that the Prime Ministers of the Dominions should, as far aspossible, come to this country at the same time. If they came one by one at different times and expected, as they naturally would, totake part in the deliberations of the War Cabinet, no true balanceof overseas opinion would be arrived at by such discussions. Hehad discussed the alternative suggestion of a continuation of theImperial War Cabinet by deputy Ministers left in London with theDominion representatives and found them unanimously opposed toit; it was essential that whoever sat in the Imperial War cabinet should either be a Prime Minister or one who had his absolutelyunqualified confidence ; they were not in favour of the presence of a[136 5-1293^1 &apos;    .
representative who might commit them to things they did not approve.The Secretary of State for India said that as regards the futurerepresentation of India the representative might either be theSecretary of State himself or, if it were considered better that theSecretary of State should be treated as one of the Imperial Ministers,then there should be one other representative of India. Both heand Lord Curzon expressed themselves in favour of the latteralternative. If the meetings of the Imperial Cabinet were to beannual, there would be no difficulty in varying the representation soas to have a representative of the Hindoo community one year, ofthe Moslems another year, of the Rulers of the Native States another,and so on.Mr. Henderson, while agreeing with the nature of the permanent machinery proposed, considered that it would have been desirable inthe immediate future to have had Dominion Ministers available who could be called in at any time. In any case, if Mr. Hughes cameover in the next few months he would have to be admitted to theWar Cabinet. It was, however, pointed out by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and other members of the War Cabinet that both General Smuts and Sir Robert Borden had specifically rejected the idea of a continuous session of the Imperial War Cabinet withDeputy-Ministers in attendance.There was general agreement that the objects of the newsessions of the Imperial Cabinet should be the discussion of foreignaffairs, defence, and questions of common interest generally, andthat it should be a body quite distinct from the British Cabinet. Ifthe present War Cabinet were hereafter superseded by a Cabineton the old lines, then only those members of the Cabinet who dealtdirectly with Imperial affairs should take part in the imperial cabinet.The Secretary was instructed to draft, on the lines of Mr. Long&apos;smemorandum, a proposal from the British War Cabinetto the Dominion representatives.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 2, 1917.
