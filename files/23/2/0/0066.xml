Ribot and other representatives of the French Government onthe subject of the French proposals communicated to the WarCabinet by Lord Derby for the occupation of Thessaly and Athens,with a view to the deposition of King Constantine. (War Cabinet144, Minute 7.)At the conclusion of the morning session the British representa-tives had handed to M. Ribot a statement of British policy preparedby Lord Robert Cecil as a result of an informal discussion earlier in the day. (Appendix I.) This policy may be summed up asfollows: (1.) In order to strengthen the blockade as a weapon of pressure on Greece to purchase and control theThessalian harvest.&apos; (2.) Having obtained complete control of this harvest to informKing Constantine that as guaranteeing Powers for theTreaty of 1803, the Allies could tolerate neither hiscontinued   violation   of   the  Greek  Constitution  in
governing the country as an absolute Monarch, nor the prolonged division of Greece into two factions ; that they,,-,must, therefore, insist on his abdication in favour of one Iof his sons, who would have to bind himself to rtde as a constitutional Monarch, with M. Venizelos, or a nomineeof M. Venizelos as his Prime Minister.(3.) After the abdication of King Constantine to distribute the harvest equitably between the different parts of greece and the Allied Armies.(4.) In the event of refusal of King Constantine to comply withthis demand, to starve Greece (this latter point does notappear in Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s Memorandum, but was brought out in the course of discussion).After an interval the French representatives had replied tothese proposals with a Memorandum (Appendix II), in which, afterrehearsing the main points of agreement and of difference betweenthe two Governments they had stated :-(a.) That in order to forestall every attempt at organised resistance and civil war, it was necessary from the outset of the Thessalian operation to carry out a military occupation of the Isthmus of Corinth ; and(b.) That it must be clearly understood that no further re-duction in the Salonica armies should be contemplateduntil a regime offering to the Allies every guarantee hadbeen installed at Athens.The Meeting of the War Cabinet was held to discuss the two latter proposals.The second proposal did not commend itself to the War Cabinet,and it was decided to reject it forthwith on the ground that theshortage of shipping makes a steady reduction of the Salonica armyessential.In regard to the first proposal of the French Government, theFirst Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointedout that it would involve war with Greece, thus violating the principle on which they have both strongly insisted, namely, that the Alliescan incur no further military commitments in this theatre. Withoutfurther study, including, in all probability, communication withofficers on the spot, they were not prepared to offer any opinion asto the position of the forces with which the French proposed to occupy the Isthmus of Corinth, nor in regard to the estimate of8,000 men which General Foch had given as the approximatenumber required for this operation.The general disposition on the part of the War Cabinet was to reject the French proposal and to adhere to the policy embodied in lord Robert Cecils Memorandum (Appendix I).It was felt that, whereas the French policy would inevitably involve the Allies in war with Greece, the British proposals, at anyrate, gave a reasonable chance of securing the abdication of King Constantine without hostilities. The reasons which led the WarCabinet to this belief were, that King Constantine has already in thepast discussed the possibility of abdication ; that M. Zaimis has also discussed this possibility ; that the prospect before King Constantine,in the event of a resistance of a starving, blockaded people, cut off from his island possessions, with the Allies in occupation of Thessaly,and with little advantage to be obtained from the Central Powers,even if they could be persuaded to come to his aid, would be so serious that he might prefer the alternative of abdication; further, that negotiations for the purchase of the harvest have made some progress, and that insistence on the necessity for some control overour prospective purchase might bring these negotiations to afavourable conclusion.   The consideration that Greece is alleged to
have only a fortnights supply of food gave further support to thisview.It was pointed out, however, that it was by no meansimprobable that some incident might arise in connection with the carrying out of the policy outlined in Appendix I, such as amassacre of Venizelists, or an unexpectedly stubborn resistance onthe part of King Constantine and his people, which would eventuallyinvolve us in war with Greece, and that in such an eventuality weshould find ourselves in a worse position than if we had adopted theFrench policy. It was urged, therefore, that the French proposals should not be summarily rejected without further exploration ofboth policies.It was further pointed out that the policy proposed by theBritish Government involved a ruthless and drastic enforcement ofthe blockade regardless of humanitarian considerations which public opinion might render it difficult to ,carry out.In regard to the French proposal, the War Cabinet felt thatthey required further information as to what would he the positionof the force which it was proposed to land at Corinth, with thegreater part of the Greek Army, ,comprising some 20,000 men, with80,000 Reservists, and 300,000 rifles, on the other side of theCorinth Canal, and with a possibly hostile population surroundingit on every side ; they also wished to know definitely where it was proposed to land the force, and what provision was to be made forthe protection of the transports against submarine attack.In regard to the British proposals, they wished to know exactly what steps would be taken in Thessaly to seize the harvest, and what the military consequences of those steps were likely to be inthe event of active resistance ,on the part of the RoyalistGovernment.The War Cabinet realised that the British proposals dependedfor their success upon conciliatory methods in carrying them out.They felt some doubt, however, whether such conciliatory methodswere likely to be adopted either by the French Government, whosepoint of view on this question is fundamentally different from our own,or still less by General Sarrail, who has never ,shown a particularlyconciliatory disposition. In fact, the Prime Minister stated that, in private conversation with M- Ribqt, he had urged that some Generalother than General Sarrail should be put In charge of the seizure ofthe Thessahan harvest.The War Cabinet decided To invite the French representatives to prolong their visitin order that the naval and military advisers of the twoGovernments might confer on the following points : (1.) The steps considered necessary to seize the harvestin Thessaly in furtherance of the policy proposedby the British Government, having special regardto the desire of the War Cabinet that this shouldbe effected peacefully and with as little provoca-tion as possible.(2.) An appreciation of what the occupation of theIsthmus of Corinth might eventually involve froma naval and military point of view.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 28, 1917.[1366-148]
APPENDIX I.

British Memorandum on Greek Policy.

OUR policy should be to aim at the reunion of Greece under a constitutional and monarchical Government with a Venizelist Ministry. We believe that that result can be secured by diplomatic pressure reinforced by the blockade. For that purpose it is no doubt necessary to obtain control over the Thessalian harvest, and it was for that reason that, at the Paris Conference, it was agreed that certain steps should be taken to obtain that control. Broadly speaking, the method was to be by purchase, reinforced by the occupation of the roads, railways, and ports necessary for the conveyance of the Thessalian harvest to Southern Greece. This was the policy which was announced to the House of Commons in the Secret Session, and there seems no reason why it should not be carried out, with one important modification. It seems from the recent telegrams from Salonica that there is no hope of reunion so long as King Constantine remains on the throne, and there is certainly much force in the contention of M. Venizelos that, even if King Constantine and he were to agree to try the experiment neither would trust the other, and it would almost certainly break down. If this be so, a situation has arisen in which the three Guaranteeing Powers would seem to have a perfect right to exercise their functions. Apart from his attitude to the Entente there is no doubt that King Constantine has broken, both in letter and spirit, the Greek Constitution. The Guaranteeing Powers are entitled to say that Greece is no longer a Constitutional State within the meaning of the Treaty of 1863.

It seems therefore that the steps contemplated at the Conference of St. Jean de Maurienne might well be taken, and King Constantine might well be called upon by three Guaranteeing Powers, with the support of Italy, if possible, to abdicate in favour of one of his sons. This should not be done until we have control of the Thessalian harvest, though, of course, nothing should be done which would lead him to suppose that we were not going to take this course. If he refused, the blockade of Greece would be enforced with full severity, and the Greek people would be informed of the reason of the action of the Entente Powers.

We have very little doubt that a policy of this kind, if carried through resolutely, but with every desire to make things as easy for King Constantine as they could be made under the circumstances, would succeed.

But to ensure success the policy must be carried out by people who believe in it. It must not be regarded as a first step towards an invasion of Greece or the occupation of Athens. To any such policy of military adventure in Greece the British Government are altogether opposed. We should like therefore to be assured that the French Government and M. Jonnart, fully and without reservation, accept this policy, or if they do not, that they will leave it to British officials to carry it out. In that case paragraphs 12 and 13 of the Paris Resolutions would require modification.(Initialled) R. C.                                    

APPENDIX II.



Mémorandum français sur la Politique grecque.



LES représentants du Gouvernement français sont absolument d&apos;accord avec le Gouvernement britannique sur la politique que les Puissances protectrices doivent suivre en Grèce : à savoir, rétablir l&apos;union, sous la Constitution actuelle, loyalement pratiquéee, avec un Ministère vénizéliste.

Avec le Gouvernement britannique, nous pensons :

1. Que la situation présente donne aux Puissances protectrices le droit et leur impose l&apos;obligation d&apos;intervenir pour rétablir la vérité constitutionnelle ;

2. Que le Roi Constantin, ayant mis à néant la Constitution grecque à la fois dans sa lettre et dans son esprit, ne pent faire en Grèce l&apos;unité indispensable et que, même s&apos;il se prêtait, ainsi que M. Vénizélos, à en faire l&apos;expérience, l&apos;échec d&apos;une telle tentative serait inévitable.


Les Puissances protectrices sont done fondees a dire, suivant les termes dumemorandum anglais, que la Grece n&apos;est plus un Etat constitutionnel dans, le sens de la; Charte de 1863.Dans ces circonstances, les representants du Gouvernement franeais estimentqu&apos;il serait preferable d&apos;occuper immediatement Athenes, pour y signifier au Roi leurvolonte d&apos;obtenir son abdication.Le Gouvernement britannique pense, lui, qu&apos;il vaut mieux, avant toute mise endemeure adressee au Roi, mettre la main sur les moissons de Thessalie et procederensuite, en cas de refus du Roi, a un reinforcement du blocus, en avertissant le peuplegrec des motifs de cette action.Quelques objections que puisse soulever ce mode de proceder, nous sommesdisposes a nous y rallier dans un profond desir de maintenir entre la Grande-Bretagneet la France une union parfaite. Toutefois, pour prevenir toute tentative de resistanceorganisee et de guerre civile, nous jugeons indispensable, des le debut de 1&apos;operation enThessalie, d&apos;occuper militairement 1&apos;istlime de Corinthe. Une teUe mesure est, a nosyeux, la meilleure garantie du deroulement pacifique des evenements.Enfin, il est bien entendu qu&apos;aucune reduction nouvelle des effectifs des Armees deSalonique ne saurait etre envisagee tant qu&apos;un regime, ofErant aux Allies toute garantie,n&apos;aura pas ete instaSe a Athenes.Le 28 rnai, 1917.
