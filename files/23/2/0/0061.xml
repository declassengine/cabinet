THE War Cabinet continued the discussion commenced onthe a 1st May on the Composition of the Irish Convention (WarCabinet, 141, Minute 17).The Chief Secretary said that he had discussed the question with Mr. Redmond and Mr. Dillon, as requested by the WarCabinet. Both these Irish Leaders considered that the Conventionmust have a comprehensive basis, as suggested by Mr. Redmond.Though not wedded to Mr. Redmond&apos;s large numbers, they considered it difficult otherwise to include all the different interests,namely, local, business, and existing Government interests. they considered that it would be necessary to rely on the President andon a small Executive Committee to formulate the proposals of theConvention.The War Cabinet, however, were given to understand that public opinion generally was opposed to a large Convention, and they themselves inclined to the view that a much smaller body was[1365--143]
desirable. The greater part of the meeting was occupied in an endeavour to frame a smaller Convention in which the various interests suggested by Mr. Redmond should be adequatelyrepresented.Sir Edward Carson pointed out that, as a matter of practical politics, it might be better to adopt a different basis of selection forthe Convention. He considered that, if the principal political parties concerned were to nominate groups of representatives, the whole scheme would have a better chance of acceptance by the UlsterCouncil. In this connection he pointed out that in Ireland everyman was a politician, so that, on whatever principles the members were chosen, the Convention would in fact be composed entirely ofmembers of one or other of the Irish political parties. The general view of the War Cabinet, however, was that the best chance ofsecuring an agreement w-as to introduce some element of a non-political character. Moreover, as the Government had already announced their intention of adopting a scheme of representatives ofthe different interests in Ireland, they could not withdraw from this position.There was some discussion as to the method by which thevarious groups would be selected. It was generally agreed that arepresentative Chairman of a County Council would have to be chosenin each Province by the Chairmen of the County Councils of that province. As regards Lord Mayors and Mayors, it was proposed to solve the difficulty of selection by including only the three LordMayors. As regards Chambers of Commerce, it was proposed to cut the number down to three selected by the Chambers of Commerce of dublin, Belfast, and Cork respectively. The question of labour representatives was recognised to present difficulties, and Mr. Dukeundertook to consult the Ministry of Labour on this point. Therepresentatives of the Roman Catholic Church would be chosen by the bishops convened by the Archbishop. As regards other religiousbodies, it was proposed only to include one representative each from theChurch of Ireland, Presbyterians, and other religious denominations.The selection of representatives of the Irish Peers, the Irish nationalist party, the Irish Unionist Party, the 0&apos;Brienist Party, the universities and the National Teachers, presented no difficulties. The method of selection of Sinn Feiners was not discussed. &quot;Various schemes were considered for allowing the Nationalists and the Irish Unionistsrespectively to nominate a certain number of members outside their parliamentary representation, but no decision was taken on thispoint. Proposals were also discussed that a representation shouldbe given to the Ulster Unionist Council, the Irish Unionist Alliance,and the Irish National League, over and above the Parliamentaryparties with which these bodies are connected.There was considerable discussion as to the proportion which each of the Irish political parties ought to have in the Convention,and in this connection it was pointed out that if the Irish nationalist party did not carry a bare majority in the Convention, there was considerable danger that the other parties might unite against it on some particular issue and wreck the scheme altogether.The War Cabinet decided that- The Chief Secretary should see the Irish leaders again, andshould inform them that the general view of the WarCabinet was that the numbers of the Convention should notexceed 70 or 80 ; that Sir Edward Carson considered thatthe Ulster Unionist Council would be more likely to assent to the scheme of an Irish Convention if assured of a corn-pact body of Irish Unionists; and that he should invitetheir views as to how these two desiderata could be recon-ciled in the foimration of the Convention.
Proposed Amnestyto Irish RebelPrisoners.2: The War Cabinet discussed the desirability of releasingpersons imprisoned in connection with the Irish rebellion. In favourof this proposal it was pointed out that the settlement of thisquestion depended on concessions being made not only by Unionists,but also by Nationalists; that the Nationalists might be able toaccept from an Irish Convention terms which their supporters wouldnot permit them to accept from anyone else ; and that for thisreason it was especially desirable to take some noteworthy step suchas an amnesty of prisoners, in order to create a favourable atmosphere.On the other hand, it was urged that the prisoners probably includedsome murderers, even though no evidence had been secured against them, and that, in consequence of the casualties sustained insuppressing the rebellion, there was a very strong feeling against the rebels among soldiers, not only in this country, but also in France.It was pointed out that it would be difficult to release a majority and to retain a few notorious malefactors, and in this connection theWar Cabinet were reminded that, when General Botha released themajority of the Cape rebels, such pressure was put on him that hevery shortly after had to release notoriously dangerous persons whom he bad intended to retain in prison.Mr. Duke undertook to have the evidence against the prisonersexamined in detail in order to advise whether a generalamnesty would be practicable,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,t May 22, 1917.0
