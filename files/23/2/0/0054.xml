The First Sea Lord raised the question as to neutralrepresentatives being placed on board hospital ships in the Mediter-ranean with a view to their being able to assure the German. Govern-ment, if called upon, that we were strictly complying with the termsof the Geneva Convention. &apos;The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to take the necessary action as to requesting theKing of Spain or the Pope to detail their representatives in thisconnection.11. With reference to War Cabinet 130, Minute 14, theWar Cabinet decided that, in order to develop and utilise the ship-building resources of this country to the best advantage, it is necessaryto concentrate the organisation in one person.The War Cabinet therefore decided that Major-General Sir Eric Geddes should be appointed to the postcreated for the purpose, and that he should be responsiblefor fulfilling the requirements of the Admiralty, WarOffice, and Ministry of Shipping, so far as is possible, bymanufacture or purchase, whether at home or abroad.For this purpose the staffs of the three Departments will beplaced under his control.Where questions of priority in allotment of resources arise, andin larger questions of policy, he will take his instructions from the War Cabinet.On account of his proposed other duties at the Admiralty inconnection with supplies of armament, &amp;c, and on accountof the complexity of naval design, it is necessary that histouch with the admiralty should be very close, and it has there fore been decided that he shall be appointed one of the lords of the Admiralty.Sir Eric Geddes will also be a member of the Shipping control committee.12.

Mr. Arthur Henderson under-took to give effect to this decision.

Mr. Henderson, Mr. G.Roberts, M.P., and Mr. Purdy had been selected to form the Mission.The War Cabinet decided that In view of the industrial situation at home, it was not desirablethat Mr. Henderson should leave the country, and that if,notwithstanding, the Executive of the Labour Partyproceeded with their proposal to send a Mission, Mr. G.Roberts should have facilities for joining it.Labour Situation:Weekly Reports.16. Mr. Henderson informed the War Cabinet that he hadbeen enquiring into the organisation of the Ministry of Labour andhad taken steps to expedite the machinery for settling disputes ; and,further, that an Intelligence Department was being created-The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Henderson should make what arrangements he considered desirable for furnishing them regularly with reports on thelabour situation.british representation inthe United Statesof America.17. With reference to Mr. Balfours proposal in a Private and personal telegram to the Prime Minister, that after his return some person of the highest prestige and political position should be selectedas a special and permanent British Representative in the UnitedStates of America, and that Lord Grey should be urged to accept this position (War Cabinet 135a, Minute 4),* the War cabinet authorised the Prime Minister to communicate with Lord Grey onthe subject.Guns for theWestern Front.18. Major-General Birch, Commanding the Artillery on theWestern Front, informed the War Cabinet that they were deficientin long-range guns and heavy howitzers of modern long-rangingpattern, and that Sir Douglas Haig wished him to point out that ifforecasts were not adhered to it is extremely difficult to make plans which it could reasonably be hoped would be successful.The Minister of Munitions reported that the delay was due partly to the programme of 4-inch guns for merchant-ships approvedby the War Cabinet, partly to the need of howitzers for the Navy,and partly to the failure of certain private firms to complete their contracts by the dates arranged, but some of the long-rangehowitzers for the Army w^ould be ready at the end of May.The Master-General of Ordnance pointed out that he understoodthere might be difficulty in realizing even the latest forecast unlessthe War Cabinet decided that the recent order given by the admiralty for 7 &quot;5-inch and 11-inch howitzers was not to interfere with thegun programme for the Army.* These Minutes, which dealt in the main with military operations and were ofan exceptionally secret character, were not printed.
The War Cabinet decided that A Conference should be held this afternoon between the Ministryof Munitions and the War Office, assisted by Major-GeneralBirch, at which the representatives of the firms should beasked to attend and the gun programme gone through, andthe best possible arrangements made to expedite deliveries of the guns so urgently required.2, Whitehall Gardens, S WMay 11, 1917.
