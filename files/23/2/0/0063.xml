French had taken over a further portion of the line, relieving two-Policy, divisions in all in front line.The Italian Front. 3.

The Publication ofMercantile losses from Submarines.4. The War Cabinet discussed the information published in the&quot; Daily Mail&quot; conveying the impression that the losses fromsubmarines were now as bad as the April figures. It was pointedout that the dilemma continued as before : if publication were permitted, it provided the enemy with propaganda which was speciallyvaluable to him at this moment, when he is sustaining his peoplemainly by encouraging hopes of a successful issue to the submarine campaign : while, on the other hand, if favourable news is published,the consumption of food in this country is greatly increased, and our allies are encouraged to clamour for more coal and similar shippingassistance.The War Cabinet decided that Having regard to the critical conditions in Germany during thetwo. months intervening before the harvest, and to the unrest due to the revolution in Russia, it would bedesirable to make a statement in the House of commons on the adjournment, in the sense that, while no risks couldbe taken and nothing could be said as regards the future,the fact remained that the losses were less, that successesagainst submarines were greater than last month, and thatthere was no chance of a defeat due to the submarine campaign, provided that the nation made strenuous efforts to produce more shipping and more food and economised.It was also felt that it was only fair to the Admiralty, at atime when they were making good headway against thesubmarine menace, that these gloomy reports should not beallowed to circulate without some effort to counteract them.The Oil Situation.IntelligenceDirectory.5. The First Sea Lord reported that the oil situation was serious, the naval reserves having been reduced to less than threemonths&apos; supply. This was partly due to a loss of five large oilerslast month. It had been necessary to restrict the cruising of theGrand Fleet owing to this shortage. The Admiralty, he said, werein communication with the United States of America with a view toan alleviation of the situation.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that aGerman Army Directory had recently been captured in France whichbad established the fact that the Department of Military Intelligencehad been correct in estimating the strength of the German divisions,as the order of battle shown by the Directory was identical with thatprepared hy the Military Intelligence Department except that itrevealed the existence of one additional Landwehr regiment.Mining.7. The First Sea Lord reported that, according to intelligencebelieved to be reliable, our recent mining operations had resulted inthe loss of two enemy destroyers and three or four other craft of a mine-sweeping cl escription.Prohibition of horse-Racing.8. The Prime Minister stated that the deputation of the JockeyClub, received on the 23rd May, had made out a strong case for areconsideration of the Government ban on racing, but not for its immediate removal (War Cabinet 127, Minute 3). He had under-taken to review the situation at the end of June, when the food situation might be clearer and it&quot; might be possible to consider the advisability then of allowing a few7 races of the better sort for thepurpose &quot;of testing the quality of the horses.Mr. Duke called attention to the special circumstances inIreland, where the strict and immediate enforcement of the prohibi-tion of racing would only lead to  illicit  race-meetings with  a
definitely seditious purpose.   In the present political situation it was most undesirable to do anything to foment fresh discontent.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief Secretary should be allowed some latitude in bringingIreland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom;that Irish races which had been arranged for during thenext two or three weeks should not be prohibited ; andthat the Government ban should not be enforced until after this period of grace.The Agricultural 9. With reference to War Cabinet 135, Minute 10, the war programme. Cabinet had before them Lord Milner&apos;s report on the agricultural programme for 1918 (Paper G.T.-764).It was pointed out that the impetus given to the agricultural programme and increased home production by the Prime Ministersspeech in the House of Commons on the 23rd February, 1917, andby the introduction of the Corn Production Bill, had expired; that,while we were fairly secure in regard to foodstuffs for 1917, thesituation in 1918 might become very serious, not only in the UnitedKingdom but in the world as a whole, whether the war continued ornot, unless special efforts were made to stimulate food production ;that the carrying out of the Agricultural Programme for 1918depended partly on the passage of the Corn Production Bill (whichwill shortly be proceeded with in Parliament), but mainly on theprovision of adequate supplies of labour, estimated by Sir Arthur Leeto number 80,000.The War Cabinet recognised that military labour was the mainpossible source of supply, but they considered it desirable that other sources should be tapped, e.g. : (a.) The interned enemy aliens ;(b.) Prisoners of war.The employment of these latter would involve a departure fromthe War Office rule that not less than sixty prisoners should beemployed in one batch.The War Cabinet decided that In principle, the carrying out of the Agricultural programme for 1918 is a matter of the greatest national importance,and they gave Lord Milner full authority to arrange forthe provision, from the various available sources, of thelabour necessary for the execution of the Programme.Ireland :The composition of the Convention.10. With reference to War Cabinet 143, Minute 1, the WarCabinet further discussed the composition of the Irish Convention.The Chief Secretary for Ireland stated that, as requested bythe War Cabinet, he had seen Mr. Redmond, Mr. Dillon, andMr. Devlin, who had taken different views in regard to the size ofthe Convention.Mr. Devlin thought a smaller number than that originallysuggested by Mr. Redmond would be sufficient.Mr. Dillon, on the other hand, was in favour of the larger number of about 170.The Prime Minister read a Memorandum giving the views of dr. Kelly, the Bishop of Ross, who considered that the convention should be limited to not more than fifty members, who should sitde die in diem. He laid great stress on the best business men being included. He was strongly opposed to inviting any Association of teachers to send representatives.
Mr. Duke urged the Cabinet that the Convention should be soconstituted by nominations from the various Irish interests that it 0\could not be described as a &quot; packed &quot; body.The War Cabinet were generally agreed that it was very important to avoid any further delay, and that, if possible, astatement should be made before Parliament adjourned for theWhitsuntide recess.It was arranged that The Prime Minister, in conjunction with Lord Curzon andMr. Duke, should see the Irish leaders, and draw up two alternative programmes, on the basis of a membership of60 and 85 respectively.Proposed Amnestyto Irish RebelPrisoners.11. With reference to War Cabinet 143, Minute 2, the chief secretary for Ireland reported that he had taken a good deal of advice on the subject of the release of these rebels, and all thoseconsulted were unanimous that the prisoners should be released, a distinction being drawn between cases of rebellion and murder.Of the total number, there were about a dozen cases that wouldrequire consideration, and of these some would have to be kept in prison.The War Cabinet, while favouring the proposed amnesty,reserved their final decision until Mr. Duke had completedhis enquiries.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.May 24, 1917.
