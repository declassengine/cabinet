APPENDIX I.Paraphrase of a Telegram from Sir G. Buchanan to Secretary of State, dated march 15, 1907.   (No. 319.)OPEN opposition is likely to develop very shortly between parties of the SocialRevolution and of the Duma. The latter is for war, and, should it prevail quickly,Russia will be rendered stronger than in the past. Peace at any price is &quot;the object ofthe former party, and military disaster would follow its advent to power. CouldEnglish Labour Leaders be induced to send a telegram to Duma Labour Leaders(Kerensky and Chkheidze) expressing their confidence that Kerensky and Ohkheidzeand their comrades will support free peoples fighting German despotism, pointing outthat every idle day spells disaster to their brothers fighting in the trenches, and thatvictory to Germany would bring disaster to all classes of the Allies. The telegrammight also refer to the unity of all classes in Britain, and especially to what theworking classes are doing. Inasmuch as advice from England at present momentcarries great weight, I attach great importance to immediate despatch of telegram onabove lines.APPENDIX II.Draft Telegram to Labour Leaders in the Duma.ORGANISED labour in Great Britain is watching with deepest sympathy theefforts of the Russian people to deliver themselves from power of reactionary elementswhich are impeding their advance to victory. Labour in England and France has long realised that despotism of Germany must be overthrown if way is to be openedfor free and peaceful development of European nations. This conviction has inspiredthem to make unprecedented efforts and sacrifices, and we confidently look forward to assistance of Russian labour in achieving the object to which we have devotedourselves. Earnestly trust you will impress on your followers that any remission of effort means disaster to comrades in trenches and to our common hopes of socialregeneration.

Storr, Secretary.PURSUANT to War Cabinet instructions, as contained in War Cabinet, 95,Minute 1, of the meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., on Tuesday, March 13, 1917,the Committee considered the question of the situation in South Persia, with special reference to the position of Sir Percy Sykes and the suggestion that an officer of the rank of General should be appointed to the chief command of all the military forcesin South Persia.It was pointed out that, since the subject had first been before the WarCabinet, the military situation in Mesopotamia had been entirely altered bySir S. Maude&apos;s brilliant campaign ; that his successes had removed the danger of any advance by Turkish forces into Persia, and that the arguments in favour of placing the whole of the military forces in Southern Persia under the control of a single officerof high military rank no longer applied with equal cogency.The Committee had before them the views of the Government of India, whichwere endorsed in the main by the Secretary of State for India and the General Staff,that Sir Percy Sykes&apos;s military experience was not sufficient for seriotis militaryoperations, that he was deficient in powers of organisation, and that his control overthe finance of the force was lax. On the other hand, they were aware that he waspersona grata with the Persian Government and people.The Committee had under consideration the future position and development ofthe South Persian Rifles, a civil police force, which it was desirable should expandboth during and after the war. They agreed that the Persian Government might regard with suspicion the growth of that force if it were given the appearance of aforeign military force, organised as such and under a military commander.On a review of all the circumstances the Committee decided that : (a.) The force at Bush ire, which, for special reasons no longer operating, hadbeen placed under the orders of the General Officer Commanding Force&quot; D,&quot; should revert to the control of the Indian Government.(b.) Sir Percy Sykes should remain in command of the South Persian Rifles,with (as already arranged by the Government of India in pursuance ofthe previous orders of the Cabinet) an experienced General Staff officer,and an officer of the Administrative Staff to assist him.(c.) A financial adviser should be added to the staff of Sir Percy Sykes.
(d.) Sir Percy Sykes should he informed confidentially that, in view of the unfavourable opinions which had been expressed by the Government ofIndia upon certain military and financial aspects of his recent proceedings in Persia, the present arrangement must be regarded as provisional in character, and will depend for its continuance upon the. results of further the Committee instructed the Secretary of State for India, in concert with theGeneral Staff, to issue the necessary orders to give effect to the above decisions.experience.(Initialled)A.
