THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that the casulties since the 22nd April in the Arras battle were 19,000, andthat the whole of the objectives of the British attack had been achieved. We had also captured 3,029 prisoners, including fifty-sisofficers.French military policy.2. With reference to War Cabinet 122, Minute 8, the War-Cabinet discussed telegram No. 380, dated the 24th April, 1917,from the British Ambassador at Paris, stating that there wererumours; that; the Senate Army Commission had asked for full information from the Minister of War regarding the non-success ofthe French offensive, and that General Nivelle might be supersededand replaced by General Petain.The Prime Minister said that this confirmed reports that he hadreceived from an independent source- in Paris, which had added the
information that the substitution of General Petain for GeneralNiveile would, it was believed, lead to the adoption of a defensivepolicy by the French Army pending the development of assistancefrom the United States of America.The War Cabinet felt that any interruption of the Frenehoffensive might, by releasing the enemy&apos;s reserves, produce mostserious effects on the Arras operations, where the British Army is engaged in complete execution of the plans agreed to by the twoGovernments. In view of the undertaking given personally byM. Ribot and M. Painleve to the Prime Minister in Paris, that pending the next Conference the French Army would continue the offensive with a view to the retention of a number of the Germanreserves on the French Front, the War Cabinet do not believe thatthe action of the Senate Army Commission can affect the operationsnow in progress, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff statedthat, apart from the telegram in question, he had no evidence thatthe French did not intend to press their offensive.The War Cabinet felt, however, that the matter was too seriousto be left in doubt, and therefore requested The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to bring the telegram to the notice of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Wilson, and invite him to give his personal impressions in regard toGeneral Nivelle&apos;s intentions.General Smuts. 3. The War Cabinet instructed the Secretary to invite general smuts to give them his opinion in regard to the strategy of the war,including the situation on the Western Front.Eussia. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the Russians and Americans were apparently coming to terms as regards the assistance of the latter in reorganising the siberian railways.salonica. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that hehad received a telegram from General Milne to the effect that thepreparatory artillery action was proceeding according to plan.The Submarine 6. With reference to War Cabinet 125, Minute 1, the WarMenace. Cabinet had a further discussion on the question of the submarinemenace. There was a general feeling that the Cabinet were not sufficiently inforzned on all the varying aspects of the question, e.g.,anti-submarine warfare, protection and control of shipping, priority of the various claims on shipping, our own requirements of food and munitions and those of our Allies, shipbuilding, steel, &amp;c.Recent enquiries by the War Cabinet have made it clear that thereis not at present sufficient co-ordination in these matters. It wasdecided that (a.) The Prime Minister should visit the Admiralty with a viewto investigating all the means at present in use in regardto anti-submarine warfare.(b.) Lord Milner, on behalf of the Cabinet, should, in conjunctionwith the Departments concerned, investigate the questionof the priority of the claims on shipping, with special reference to the accumulation of the largest possiblestocks of food-supplies, and to the arrangements for shipping such supplies at ports abroad and disembarkingthem in the United Kingdom.
(c.) Lord Curzon should decide, after enquiry from the Headsof Departments and other persons whose views might beobtained with advantage, the general question of theoutput of shipping, including more particularly thefollowing matters which were before the War Cabinet C (i.) The priority of steel between shipbuilding andother claims ;(ii.) The question of completing merchant ships in course of construction, but whose further progress has been deferred owing to theabsence of certificates from the Board ofTrade;(hi.) The War Office shipbuilding demands (G.T.-498);(iv.) The question of building &quot; unsinkable &quot; mammothships.Belfast.7. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he hadreceived information that six of the vessels referred to in Minute 6(ii) were being delayed at the works of Messrs. Harland and Wolff,Belfast, owing to the absence of the certificates referred to, and thata further small extension of works was desired by that firm to enablethem to expedite the building of standard and other ships.The War Cabinet decided that The Board of Trade should issue forthwith the certificatesrequired, and the Ministry of Munitions should grantfacilities for the extension of the works desired by messrs. Harland and Wolff.Bemoval of BaseSupply fromAvonmouth and liverpool.8. The War Cabinet decided that, with reference to thequestion of the removal of the base supply by the military fromAvonmouth and Liverpool The Secretary of State for War and the Shipping Controllershould confer together with a- view to settling this matter,the question being only brought up for the decision of theWar Cabinet in the event of their failure to agree. In anycase, a report of their action should be furnished for theinformation of the War Cabinet.Norway and sweden.9. Lord Robert Cecil stated that the Norwegian Minister had expressed the view that relations between Norway and germany were likely, sooner or later, to result in a state of war between thosecountries, and that he had asked for information as to what action the British covdd take to protect the Norwegian coast.Lord Robert Cecil added that a telegram had been receivedfrom Sweden which indicated that, the Swedes also realised thepossibility of war between Norway and Germany, and were anxiousas to their own action in the matter; indications pointed to the factthat they would have to ally themselves with Norway.On the suggestion of the First Sea Lord, the War Cabinetdesired Lord Robert Cecil to recommend to the Norwegian Governmentthat Norway should send naval representatives to london to concert measures with the Admiralty, and that heshould further inform the Norwegian Government that itwould be probable that assistance should also be asked for from the United States of America.The First Sea Lord undertook to discuss the question with admiral Sims, the representative of the United states navy Board&apos;in this country.[1365-126]
Italian Aspirations 10.   In   continuation   of   the   discussion  recorded  in  Warin Asia Minor. Cabinet 124, Minute 17, the War Cabinet had under consideration a draft telegram to the British Ambassador in Rome, prepared by-Lord Robert Cecil, iu regard to the Italian aspirations in asia minor.After some discussion the statement in the Appendix was approved for communication to the Italian Government.Palestine :The Sykes-PieotAgreement.11. Out of the question of Italian aspirations in Asia Minorarose a general discussion on the subject of the Sykes-PicotAgreement, which was subjected to considerable criticism, moreparticularly from the point of view of the proposed internationali-sation of Palestine, which was felt to be impossible.The Prime Minister said that at the recent Conference he hadhinted that the British Government considered that Palestine should come under British control, but that the proposal had been verycoldly received.It was stated that information had been obtained that there wasa strong feeling in Prance that Palestine should be included in theFrench sphere.Although the War Cabinet inclined to the view that sooner or later the Sykes-Picot Agreement might have to be reconsidered in concert with our Allies, it was decided that No action should at present be taken in this matter.Franco-Italian 22. Jn connection with the statement in the report circulateddelations. by  the  Prime  Minister  (Paper I.C.-20)   regarding  his  recent conference with the French and Italian Representatives, to theeffect that Baron Sonnino had shown himself far less hostile thanformerly to the French policy in Greece, Lord Robert Cecilsuggested the possibility that some understanding had been reached between the French and Italian Governments on the basis that france should have a free hand in Greece in return for Frenchsupport to Italian aspirations in Asia Minor.Greece. 13. Lord Robert Cecil drew the attention of the War Cabinetto a misunderstanding on the part of the French Government withregard to his answer to a question by Mr. R. McNeiR in the Houseof Commons, and stated that he had been informed that, in conse-quence of the erroneous reporting of the answer referred to, theFrench GoA&apos;ernment had stated that they considered themselvesrelieved of all their undertakings as to not advancing in Thessaly.The War Cabinet decided that The French must be informed that they must stand by their agreement and await the decisions that may be arrived winter the forthcoming Conference, and requested Lord robert cecil to explain to the French Ambassador the situationand the erroneous interpretation made by the French.Palestine: 14. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theOperations. Chief of the Imperial General Staff (G.T.-533), in which he suggested a modification in the instructions issued last March to general sir A. Murray to advance at once on Jerusalem. The Chief of theImperial General Staff explained that General Murray, having failedup to the present to capture the Turkish position covering Gaza,was not unlikely, in his desire to carry out his instructions, to
undertake a further attack, in which he might lose a very largenumber of men with doubtful prospects of success.The War Cabinet approved the modification of the instructions,and requested the Chief of the Imperial General Staff toinform General Sir A. Murray that he was to take everyfavourable opportunity of defeating the Turkish forcesopposed to him, and to follow up with all the means athis disposal any success gained, with the object of drivingthe Turks from Palestine as and when this becomespracticable.15. The War Cabinet continued their discussion (WarCabinet 124, Minute 5) on the question of the Chief Command ofthe Egyptian Expeditionary Force. General Smuts&apos; name was again brought up in this connection, but doubt was expressed as towhether such an appointment would be favourably received by the australians, who have 20,000 men engaged in Egypt. It was,moreover, pointed out that General Smuts has had no experience inthe modern conditions of European warfare, which also prevailed tosome extent in the Palestine campaign.No decision was taken.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 25, 1917.
APPENDIX I.Copy of Telegram approved by the War Cabinet to be sent to Sir R. Rodd, Rome.YOUR telegram. *You should make the following communication to the Italian Minister for ForeignAffairs : The War Cabinet have had under consideration the claims put forward by theItalian Government, under article 9 of the Treaty of the 26th April, 1915, to an equitable share of territory in the region of the Mediterranean adjoining the province of Adalia, in the event of the complete or partial partition of the territories of turkey in Asia.Although the, partition of these regions is one of the aims, of the Allies in this war, it is. still far from realisation. Nevertheless, subject to the consent of the RussianGovernment, the War Cabinet agree conditionally to the zones of. occupation and ofinterest respectively to be attributed to Italy, as defined in the Conference held at st.,. Jean, de-Maurienne on the 19th April, and as shown on the.map. It is understood by the War Cabinet that, if at the time when peace is. declared, the total or partialpossession of the territories contemplated in the agreements, come to between GreatBritain, France, Italy, and Russia as to the disposal of part of the Ottoman Empirecannot be fully accorded to one or more of those Powers, then the interests of thePowers concerned will be again taken into equitable consideration having regard tothe efforts made by each of the Powers.The War Cabinet desire, however, to point out. to the Italian Government that theallocation to Italy of such large territories of the Ottoman Empire can hardly beregarded as justified by the effort hitherto made by Italy in the war as compared withthe sacrifices already made by Great Britain, France, and Russia, more particularly intheir conflict with Turkey, in which no Italian forces have so far taken part.While a considerable French Naval and Military force co-operated with british ships and troops in the attacks on the Dardanelles, Great Britain has during thepast 2Jr years maintained a force of more than 300,000 men in operations undertakenagainst the Turks on the confines of Egypt and in Mesopotamia, while Russia, duringthe same period, has carried on a successful campaign in Eastern Asia Minor, andinflicted serious losses upon Turkey of territory, men, and material- The exhaustion of Turkey, which alone could render such a partition as now contemplated possible,will, if realised, be chiefly due to efforts of the Allies not shared by Italy. Underthese circumstances, the War Cabinet strongly urge the Italian Government to make an increased effort to co-operate with the Allies against the common enemy, and they trust that they will understand that the achievement of Italian aspirations in asia minor must be conditional on such an effort being made.The War Cabinet also make a reservation to their assent to the eventual cession of Smyrna that the port shall be free.
