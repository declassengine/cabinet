Injuries to a 1. THE First Lord reported that a hospital ship had beenHospital Ship. struck either by a mine or torpedo off the Owers Light Vessel, with524 wounded on board.   All the wounded had been rescued, andthe ship had been towed into Portsmouth.Loss of Steamship 2. The First Sea Lord reported the loss, in the Irish Sea, of the&quot;Drina.&quot; steamship &quot; Drina &quot; with 11,000 tons of meat on board.    It was notyet certain whether the ship had been struck by a mine or a torpedo.About 400 passengers and crew had been landed at Milford.Loss of the destroyer&quot; Pheasant.&quot;Overdue Vessel.Air said at salonica.Mesopotamia.* 3. The First Sea Lord reported the loss of the new destroyer&quot;Pheasant &quot; near the Pentland Firth, with about 80 men on board.4. The First Lord reported that the &quot; Brecknockshire&apos;(7,000 tons), on a voyage from Liverpool to Rio, was 16 days overdue5. The First Sea Lord reported that from 15 to 20 enemy aircraft had attacked Salonica and inflicted about 250 casualties.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported furtherfavourable news in regard to the pursuit of the defeated enemy inMesopotamia, and the capture of large numbers of prisoners and large quantities of booty.Blockade:The Pope&apos;sOvertures.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs consulted the WarCabinet in regard to an enquiry made by the Pope as to whether weshould be willing to agree to a cessation by all the belligerents of&quot;warfare by starvation,&quot; i.e., blockade so far as food is concerned(Appendix 1).   The War Cabinet decided that: The Pope&apos;s proposal was not one that could be accepted. Itwas doubtful whether it was technically feasible, or, ifagreed upon, whether Germany could be trusted to adhere to any such arrangement. The danger would be that, afteraccumulating a certain stock of food, Germany would find,,some pretext for throwing the arrangement over andreverting to unrestricted submarine warfare. Moreover, toaccept the proposal would be to abandon the whole of our&apos;. Unary policy, of which the blockade formed an essential part; and even to consider it would be an admission onour part of the success of the submarine campaign, and ofour own weakness. The War Cabinet consequentlyauthorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a courteous refusal to the proposal.The shipping situation in 1918.8. A discussion followed as to the probable effects of the con-continuation of the present system of warfare in 1917 and 1918. Therepresentatives of the Admiralty pointed out that, with the shorternights and the increased number of German submarines being com-pleted, the prospect was that our losses hj the submarine campaignwould be increased rather than diminished in the near future. Thepossibility of continuing to the end. of 1917 and during 1918 would depend mainly on the extent to which we could guarantee the food supply of the United Kingdom by setting aside a. definite reserve ofships for this purpose, and on the possibility of reducing the obliga-tions of the Navy and of our shipping on the various overseascampaigns, as advocated in the First Sea Lord&apos;s memorandum of
21st February. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressedthe view that salonica was the least effective of the overseasexpeditions, besides being the one which absorbed the largestamount of shipping. It was urged, on the other hand, that theabandonment of this expedition was undesirable on political grounds.In regard to the question of food supplies in the UnitedKingdom, it was pointed out that, while the 1917 harvest would notexceed that of 1916 as far as acreage under cultivation was concerned, though it might be greatly increased by better weather,the harvest of 1918 ought to show a much larger yield in consequenceof the measures now being taken in hand.It was further pointed out that if the cereal ration were reducedto one-half and made up by an increased ration of meat, we could go on for a full year without trenching on our supply of milch cows.Haying regard to the serious view taken by the representativesof the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller in regard to theshipping situation, and to the importance of ensuring our power tocontinue our full military effort in the future, the War cabinet decided that: The First Lord of the Admiralty should set up a Committeecomprising representatives of the Admiralty, the ShippingController, and the Food Controller, together with theCanadian Minister of Naval Service, to examine exhaustivelyand report on the prospective shipping situation in theevent of a continuance of the war during 1917 and 1918.For purposes of calculation it should be assumed that, so far ascereal crops are concerned, if we can last till the harvestof 1918 we shall be self-supporting for the remainder ofthat year. So far as the overseas expeditions are con-cerned, the calculations should be based on alternativehypotheses to be arranged with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.Merchant 9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumShipbuilding. by the Shipping Controller on the building of merchant ships athome and abroad (Appendix II).The shipping Controller asked for authority in regard to theextent to which the programme of overseas purchase should becarried out.   The War Cabinet decided that : The merchant shipbuilding and shipping purchase programme,both at home and abroad, should be carried out on theassumption that the war will last through the year 1918,and. authorised him to use his utmost endeavours on this basis to exploit all possible sources of supply, whether bypurchase or building.The British 10. The War Cabinet discussed the question of making moreColumbia Model. uge 0f tke Canadian shipyards. Sir Robert Borden asked whetherwooden ships of about 2,500 tons each would be suitable. The WarCabinet, who had previously considered this matter (War Cabinet45, Minute 8), concurred in Sir Robert Borden&apos;s suggestion, moreparticularly in view of the possibility of using these wooden ships in coastal trades, and in waters free from submarines (e.g., betweenBombay and the Persian Gulf, and in the Australian coastal trade),to release the steamers at present in those services.The Shipping Controller pointed out the difficulties in con-nection with ballast arrangements, but said that his representative,Mr. Esplen, is at present at Ottawa, and is looking into the wholequestion of the use of these wooden ships..The War Cabinet authorised the Shipping Controller to take steps to carry Sir Robert Borden&apos;s suggestion into effect.
Sir Robert Borden informed the War Cabinet that he proposedto send a telegram to the Canadian Government, asking them togive the Shipping Controllers representative every facility.The Report of theDardanellesCommission.11. With reference to the decision of the War Cabinet at themeeting held on the 28th February, 1917 (War Cabinet 82,.Minute 18), the First Lord represented that, from the point of viewof the Admiralty Intelligence Department, it was highly important that every precaution should be taken to avoid any risk of publicitybeing given to certain of the excised portions of the report of theDardanelles Commission.   The War Cabinet decided that: The Chancellor of the Exchequer should place himself in communication with the Speaker and the leaders of thevarious parties in the House of Commons and explain theobjections of the Admiralty to the course announced inthe House of Commons, and ask them if they would be willing, instead of receiving the original report, to read itat the offices of the War Cabinet.Timber.NewfoundlandScheme.12. Sir Edward Morris mentioned that Mr. Beeton, one of the directors of the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, whohave 1,500 men, mostly skilled, engaged in woodcutting, had suggested that he could bring these men over to this country inApril.CanadianAssistance.13. The Canadian representatives also undertook to consider how many more skilled timbermen Canada could supply in additionto the 5,000 previouslyconnection Sir G. Perleynumbers required if thethey now were in Franceasked forurged that by the War Office.   In this^   . ,^ u it would be easier to get themen were not obliged to be in khaki, asIt was pointed out that that, at any rate,would not apply to men engaged for timber felling in England.Mr. Alfred deRothschilds Offer.14. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet thatMr. Alfred de Rothschild had offered his two valuable forests in theChilterns to the nationa free gift.The  secretary   was  instructed   to  convey   to   Mr.   Alfredde Rothschild the thanks of the War Cabinet.Imperial WarCabinet Meetings.15. The date for the opening of the Special Imperial Meetingsof the War Cabinet and for the Imperial Conference was discussed.It was generally agreed that it would be necessary to wait for the arrival of General Smuts and the Indian representatives, who werenot due for another ten or twelve days ; but that, on the other hand,it would be impossible, in view of the domestic arrangements of several of the Ministers, to postpone all the business till the arrival of Mr. Hughes and the Australian representatives, which could not take place before the 9th April at the earliest. It was suggestedthat there were a great many questions, more particularly thosedealing with the individual effort to be made by each part of theEmpire for the carrying on of the war, which could be discussedwithout serious inconvenience in the absence of the Australian,representatives ; while, on the other hand, such questions as thediscussion of the Terms of Peace would necessarily require thepresence of representatives of the whole: Empire. If Sir robert borden and the other Prime Ministers could undertake not to leavethis country before the end of April, that would allow three weeksfor the discussion of Terms of Peace and other urgent matters of
common interest, while matters more particularly relating toAustralia^ effort in the war could be discussed with the Australianrepresentatives afterwards.   The War Cabinet decided that: The Special Imperial Sittings of the War Cabinet should beginabout the 20th March, but that the discussion of peace terms, and similar urgent matters of common interest,should be postponed until Mr. Hughes&apos; arrival. Meanwhilea number of questions, such as, for instance man-power,timber supply, mineral production, &amp;c, could be discussedbefore the 20th March between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Dominion representatives, either outside or at the meetings of the War Cabinet, on the distinct under-standing, however, that no decision affecting theCommonwealth of Australia should be taken.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was instructed to send a telegram to Mr. Hughes in the above sense, and informing him that it was hoped that none of the dominion prime Ministers would leave before the end of April.(Appendix III.)(Initialled) D.

APPENDIX I.(1-)Paraphrase of [a telegram from Count de Salis (Vatican) to Foreign Office, datedthe 28th February, 1917.THE communication which follows was made to me last night by the CardinalSecretary of State. The proposal which the Holy Father is disposed to make is absolutely secret. It has been communicated to none of the Powers ; nothing hasbeen said either to public men or to private individuals.The proposal which the Holy Father is disposed to make to England and toGermany, and to all the.belligerents, is that, in respect to everything serving for foodthere should be neither blockade nor submarines, i.e., warfare by means of starvationshould simultaneously cease.The Holy Father will make this proposal officially to Germany if England doesnot oppose it, and without in any way suggesting England&apos;s secret assent. Then incase of Germany&apos;s acceptance, a formal proposal will be made to England. Thisproposal emanates from the Pope himself, who is deeply concerned with the presentsituation ; the proposal was made to me only, and was accompanied with a pledge of absolute secrecy. The situation in Italy appeared to the Cardinal to be serious. Inreply to a request for my opinion on the proposal I said that it appeared to me thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government had more to hope than to fear at present from the position on the sea.   The proposal has been communicated to Sir R. Rodd.(2.)Paraphrase of a&apos;draft telegram from Foreign Office to Count de Salis.With reference to telegram No. 9, dated the 28th February, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment wish you to convey to the Cardinal Secretary of State their thanks for hiscommunication. The high motives animating the Holy Father in considering thesequestions are appreciated by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The form in which the communication has been made to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the fact that it hasbeen made to them alone, in the first instance, are also sincerely appreciated. Butthey feel that between their methods of warfare and those of the Germans no faircomparison is possible. They cannot be treated as comparable, or balanced oneagainst the other, for they are on entirely different planes. A proposal which would compel His Majesty&apos;s Government to oppose suggestions originating with the HolyFather himself is earnestly deprecated.APPENDIX II.Building of Merchant Ships at Home and Abroad.(Memorandum by Shipping Controller.)THE Shipping Controller thinks it desirable to report to the War Cabinet as tothe progress made up to date in securing new tonnage, both at home and abroad.In this country contracts will have been placed by the end of the week for about60 steamers of standard type. The great majority will be of 8,200 tons dead weightcapacity ; but the number includes certain vessels of 5,000 and 3,000 tons to be builton the smaller slips.Abroad (i-e., in the United States, Japan, and Canada) orders^ have been placed for 52 steamers of about 460,000 tons. The greatest number, viz., 45, have been secured in the United States, at a cost of approximately 13,300,0002.
Of the 52 steamers mentioned, 29 are for delivery in 1917, and the remainder for. * delivery in the early part of 1918. Offers are outstanding for some 20 ships, and enquiries are still being actively prosecuted.While the Controller^ existing authority covers purchases for delivery throughout1918, he desires at this stage to consult the War Cabinet in regard to the extent to($) which the programme of overseas purchase should be carried, in view of the financial commitments already incurred in America, and of the opinion which has been expressedby the Shipbuilding Advisory Committee that from the end of this year it should bepossible, granted a sufficient supply of steel, to turn out ships from the home yards ata rate approaching one a day.February 28, 1917.APPENDIX III.Paraphrase of Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia.(Sent 6-55 p.m., March 2, 1917.)I WAS very glad to get your telegram of 1st March. Meanwhile representatives from Canada, New Zealand, and Newfoundland are here, and Smuts should arriveabout middle of March. It will be necessary to make a beginning with urgent business,more especially as some members will be compelled to leave this country at end ofApril owing to Parliamentary exigencies. We therefore propose to hold first meeting20th March. Every care will be taken to reserve questions affecting Australia for finaldecision after your arrival. Long.o
