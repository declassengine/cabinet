Salonica. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived information from General Milne that he was of opinionthat General Sarrail&apos;s delay in making his attack was not due toany ulterior motives, but was in consequence of the failure of hisplan for the attack in the vicinity of Monastir and the intention ofsynchronising his attack with an expected Russian offensive.General Milne stated that M. Painleve had taken measures toquicken up General Sarrail&apos;s arrangements, and an attack in thenear future might be anticipated.The First Sea Lord reported that, owing to the submarinedanger in the Mediterranean, it was impracticable to continue tosupply the Salonica Expedition with stores, &amp;c, and to evacuatethe sick and wounded.   The&apos; War Cabinet decided that  The Shipping Controller, in consultation with the War Officeand the Admiralty, should prepare a statement showing what shipping would be required and what amount wouldbe released if, after the impending attack, it was decided towithdraw our forces from that field of operations and to fall back on the defensive line in the vicinity of Salonica.Palestine. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the railway had been completed up to within four miles of Gaza, that the English attack had commenced successfully, andthat General Murray&apos;s Army was now about two miles from Gaza,General Murray had informed him that he had received much- assistance from the bombardment by the British and French men-of-war.4. In reference to War Cabinet 119, Minute 13, the War-Cabinet had before them telegram No. 363, dated the 17th April,1917, from the British Ambassador at Paris, relative to GeneralBailloud and the question of his being in Command of the french force. They considered the proposal that General Bailloud shouldbe attached to the force on a Mission of Inspection was highlyunsatisfactory, and directed the Acting Secretary to have the telegram from the Ambassador sent to the Prime Minister, with theexpression of their view, and requesting him to deal with thesituation.Eussia. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that he had received a telegram from Colonel Knox, whostated that he did not believe in.any big Russian offensive beingpracticable under the conditions now prevailing. General Hanbury-Williams reported, however, that he had interviewed GeneralAlexeieff, who, whilst agreeing that the situation in Petrograd wasvery serious, hoped nevertheless to carry out an offensive in the nearFrench liaison officer.The Western Front, 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therewas nothing of importance to report with regard to our Front. Asregards the French attack, it might be summed up as follows : The attack of the Ivth  Army in Champagne had proved faiflysuccessful. The Vth Army, which had only reached the secondGerman line, had been subjected to strong counter-attacks, but had maintained most of the ground that had been gained. The VlthArmy was held up after taking the first German position in the offensive on the Aisne. Generally speaking, the French attack hadnot achieved apparently the results expected, but information was rather obscure. He stated that very bad weather prevailed on both our Front and that of the French.
future. General Alexeieff hoped to be able sufficiently to contain theGermans on the Russian Western Front as to prevent the transfer ofany Divisions to France.As opposed to this view, the War Cabinet had before them atelegram (No. 537, dated the 17th April, 1917) from the military attache at Petrograd, conveying the view of a Russian military officer that any hope of a Russian offensive was out of the question,that he was doubtful whether the Russian troops would hold theirground if attacked, and that he considered Riga could be taken bythe Germans whenever they wished to do so.6. General Alexeieff had also stated that the difficulty withregard to Asiatic Turkey w.as siipply and transport, and he foresawno prospect of an offensive in that theatre.7. The War Cabinet had before them telegram No. 851 of the17th April from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Athens, relative to thealarming situation in Greece.   The War Cabinet decided that The Foreign Office should forward the telegram in question,and one relating to certain action taken at Cerigo (No. 853of the 17th April, 1917), to the Prime Minister for his information, and such action as he might think fit.8. In reference to Imperial War Cabinet 9, Minute 3, and WarCabinet 119, Minute 5, the Chief of the Imperial General staff gave theWar Cabinet further particulars as to what had apparently taken place at, the interview between the President, Ministers, and General Officersof the French Army with regard to deferring the attack on theWestern Front, and mentioned that the question of such a change ofplan w-as not raised until the 6th April, i.e., two days after thepreparatory bombardment of our offensive had started. The Frenchjustification for such a proposed change of plan was reported to bethat, owing to the United States of America having come into thewar, it meant that the Allies could last indefinitely, and therefore a defensive policy would be the correct one to adopt.9. The First Sea Lord reported that two par-hospital ships carrying wounded had been sunk in the English Channel. One,the &quot;Lanfranc,&quot; was carrying British wounded as well as Gfermanwounded and unwounded prisoners. The casualties, as far as hadbeen ascertained, were under 100 ; a large proportion of theGermans had been saved.As regards the other hospital ship, the &quot; Donegal,&quot; there were46 casualties. He stated that both hospital ships were proceedingfrom Havre to Southampton, and each had an escort of two destroyers.The question arose whether it would not be better to sendhospital ships, painted as such, openly by day, rather than unpaintedby night. The First Sea Lord said that there was no question thatthe safer method was to run these hospital ships unlighted by nightwith destroyer escorts.The War Cabinet decided that-The Admiralty should prepare, in conjunction with the Propa-ganda Department, a statement in connection with the lossof these vessels, pointing out that they had necessarilybeen carrying German wounded prisoners, and that suchwould have to be the case in future.The First Sea Lord was requested to bring the proposed state-ment for the press before the Cabinet for their consideration before it was published.
The First Sea Lord stated that the hospital ship &quot;Arcadian&apos;had been torpedoed in the Mediterranean, and that 388 were atpresent missing, though some of these were known to have beenrescued and taken to Milo Island.10. The First Sea Lord reported the possible destruction of a submarine by the destroyer &quot; Beagle &quot; off Naxos Island.It was stated by the First Sea Lord that he had received information that a United States patrol vessel had been attacked bya submarine off Sandy Hook, but he thought the accuracy of thisreport was open to doubt.11. In reference to War Cabinet 117, Minute 11, the Secretaryof State for War reported on the extremely serious situation withregard to the evacuation of our wounded from France. He statedthat, if a certain number were brought across daily, the matter could probably be dealt with by the hospitals at home. he considered the real difficulty was the lack of doctors, and mentioned that, if the Military Service Act was made applicable to all doctorsunder the age of 41, and the Tribunals were not allowed to grantexemptions, the demand might be met The War Cabinet requested the Secretary of State for War togo further into the matter with the President of the RoyalCollege of Physicians and the President of theRoyal College of Surgeons, and report fully to the WarCabinet on Friday next as to the steps that had alreadybeen taken and the steps Avhich can possibly be taken to remedy this grave situation.12. The Secretary of State for War also reported on the hospitalsituation as regards the Salonica Expeditionary Force,- and indicated that the position was even graver than that which prevailed athome.The First Sea Lord reported that the sailings of hospital ships in the Mediterranean were entirely suspended unless the ships wereescorted, but even then the escorts were inadequate to ensureimmunity from attack. As the matter stood at present it appearedto be impossible to deal with the wounded and the numerous Casesof malaria that might be anticipated in the near future.The Secretary of State for War reported that he wasendeavouring to procure a sanatorium at Mount Athos, with, a viewto alleviating the situation, but was without information at present.The War Cabinet decided that This matter should also be reported on by the Secretary ofState for War on Friday next.13. Lord Robert Cecil brought to the notice of the War Cabinetthe fact that the British Minister at Mexico had stated that, in viewof the situation prevailing in that country, he thought it desirable,for the sake of British prestige, that he should hand over to theAmerican Government the protection of British interests, and askfor his passports. lord Robert Cecil reported that the question had been referred to the United States Government, and the WarCabinet decided To&apos;await the reply of the United States Government before taking any further action.
Prisoners of War: 14. in reference to Imperial War Cabinet, 10, Minute 4, the stoppage of Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that there wasParcels. no definite evidence that parcels for British prisoners in germany were not reaching them as a part of a reprisal policy, but that information asked for from Sir William Townley on this question had not yet been received.   The Secretary of State for War thought^ that in certain districts in Germany the non-delivery of the parcelsmight be due to the dislocation of the railway services. He statedthat it had been represented to him that (a.) Individual prisoners in many cases still receive by parcelsmore food than they could eat ;(6.) An excessive amount of breadstuffs was being exported inthis way.The War Cabinet decided that Endeavours should be made to prevent provisions beine; sent toBritish prisoners in excess of the allowance laid down bythe Food Controller as the national ration.Reprisals.15. It was suggested that the Germans might be stoppingparcels as a retaliation for the detention of German prisonerswithin the 30-kilom. zone in France, and it was proposed thatparcels coming to prisoners of war in this country should no longer be delivered.   The War Cabinet decided that  No action should be taken to give effect to this proposal until more precise information had been received as to whetherparcels for British prisoners in Germany had been definitely stopped as a matter of policy.Hospital Ships: 16. With reference to War Cabinet 119, Minute 16, the WarReprisals. Cabinet further discussed the question of reprisals for the sinking of hospital ships. It was suggested that a public announcement should be made that after a certain date every unfortified Germantown in a certain area would be subjected to bombardment whilethe enemy continued to sink hospital ships. The War cabinet decided That the Admiralty should be requested to ask the FrenchGovernment to expedite their reply to this proposal, andas soon as it was received the matter should be brought before the War Cabinet.Heavy Artilleryfor Russia.17. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked for thedecision of the War Cabinet as to the despatch of further heavy artillery to Russia, and pointed out the need for this artillery on other Fronts, and the improbability of its being usefully employedin Russia if sent there owing to the general chaotic state of theRussian Army.   The War Cabinet approved that The despatch of further heavy artillery to Russia should be delayed for the present.Belgian Relief 18. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum (G.T.-475)Fund. by Lord Robert Cecil relative to the Belgian Relief Fund, whichpointed out that the American Government were desirous of taking over the cost of this relief, and proposed to allot 3O,0O0,000Z. forthe purpose. He stated that  he had approached the FrenchGovernment, who were willing to accept the proposal, but thatafter consultation with the Belgian Government he was of opinionthat they did not favour any alteration in existing arrangements.[1365-122] ; C
The Food Question:An InternationalBoard.Re-distillation ofPotable Spirits for munitions.Extension of offices of Ministryof Shipping.In view of the strong desire of the American Government, asexpounded by Mr. Hoover, to take over this Relief for sentimentaland not belligerent reasons, the War Cabinet authorised Lord Robert Cecil to interview the Belgian Minister, and suggest to him that the British Government would prefer the proposed new arrangement.19. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on theFood Question, by Mr. Herbert Hoover, and a Note thereon byLord Robert Cecil (G.T.-474, Appendix 1).Mr. Hoover explained that the object proposed was to securemore effective co-operation among the Allied Governments in thepurchase and distribution of the staple food supplies. It was not intended to supersede the existing machinery, but rather to direct,improve, and extend it by means of an International Food Board.He had not obtained President Wilson&apos;s approval to the suggestion,but he was proceeding immediately to the United States of america to take up the Chairmanship of a Food Board there.Lord Devonport described the machinery at present inoperation in this country, and the need for its development,especially in view of the influence of Neutral Powers on the markets.(Appendix II)The War Cabinet considered it desirable that any InternationalBoard set up should be as small as possible, consistent with its being representative. It might be necessary to arrange for the representation of the British Dominions and India by means of aSub-Committee attached to the British representative on the Board.The War Cabinet decided (a).(6.)To approve the principle of an International Food Board,and asked Lord Milner first to confer with the Secretary ofState for the Colonies on the subject of the representationof the Dominions.That Lord Robert Cecil should interview the AniericanAmbassador with the object of securing the adhesion ofthe United States to the project, and, through theUnited States, that of France and Italy.20. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Hon.Waldorf Aster on the Re-distillation of Potable Spirits for Munitions(G.-113).Mr. Astor explained that the tonnage now used to importmolasses and West Indian spirits for the manufacture of alcoholcould be saved by the re-distillation of spirit now in bond in thiscountry. A further amount of tonnage could be saved if the con-sumption of yeast (the making of which involved importing grain)was reduced.Dr. Addjson stated that the question had been examined bySir Frederick Nathan and by the Food (War) Committee of theRoyal Society, and that the problem was being further investigated by the Alcohol Committee.The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the discussion pending the receipt of the Report ofthe Alcohol Committee.21. The Shipping Controller brought to the notice of the WarCabinet the difficulties that the Ministry of Shipping had to contendwith in consequence of several of the departments being housedelsewhere than in the new buildings in St. James&apos;s Park, with theresult that the best work was not attainable, and delays arose.(G.T.-473). &quot;    &apos;   &apos;
The First Commissioner of Works pointed out that the newoffices would take at least three months to build, and he doubted,moreover, whether timber was available for their construction. he added that the work would call for the. employment of 400 workmen.He stated that Bridgwater House could be allotted in lieuThe War Cabinet decided, in view of the difficulties and delaypointed out by the First Commissioner of Works, that Additional offices in St. James&apos;s Park should not be erected, butthat Bridgwater House should be appropriated for the useof the Ministry of Shipping.New Order of the 22. With reference to War Cabinet 87, Minute 14, the WarBritish Empire. Cabinet considered Lord Curzon&apos;s Memorandum on the proposed new Order of the British Empire (Q.-140, Appendix HI). lord curzon explained the difficulties with which his Committee hadbeen faced in their efforts to arrive at a solution of this question, and explained the working of the alternative schemes which were putforward.The War Cabinet decided To recommend to His Majesty the adoption of the second scheme,as suggested in Lord Curzon&apos;s Memorandum.(Initialled) A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 18, 1917.
G.T.-474. APPENDIX I.The Food Question.(Note by Lord Robert Cecil and a Memorandum by Mr. Herbert Hoover.)MR. HOOVER spoke to me this afternoon about tbe foodstuffs question.He has, I understand, been appointed something like Food Controller in theUnited States, and he left with me the annexed memorandum., the pith of which he stated to me.The proposal seems to me eminently sound. Apart from the advantages of it towhich he calls attention in the memorandum, it will be of very great service in dealingwith the food and fodder supplies to neutrals. We shall all agree that, if there is anyquestion of starvation, it is better that the neutrals should starve before the Allies;and, even if it does not come to that, it is obviously necessary, in the face of thesubmarine menace, to treat the food questions of the world as one.I venture, therefore, to urge that this matter should be immediately taken intoconsideration by the War Cabinet, and a decision arrived at upon it.(Initialled) R. C., Foreign Office, April 16, 1917.. Memorandum.1. It appears to me that the time has arrived when much broader, more intimate,and more effective co-operation can be established among the various organs of theAllied Governments and among the different Governments themselves for the purchase and distribution of the staple food supplies. The entrance of the United States intothe war, the diminishing world supplies, and the growth of food control among theAllies all afford reason for a further step in organisation.2. The main staples which it would appear desirable to take in hand at an earlymoment are wheat, maize, oats, rice, rye, barley, peas, beans, sugar, meat, and fats.The important producing centres having surpluses for export are, with the exceptionof the Argentine, now under Allied control, and are, therefore, now possible of exclusivedistribution and use by the Allies.3. The general outlook from now on is that the available supplies and shippingwill be a diminishing, rather than an increasing, quantity ; that, in consequence, control will need to be exercised in the allocation of these supplies among the Allies andco-operation in sale and purchase between the exporting Allies and consuming Alliesexercised, in order to provide necessities, and prevent still further rises in prices and consequent further embarrassment of the consuming populations in all the allied countries, including the United States.4. By degrees the free play of merchandising has been further and furtherrestricted owing to the difficulties of shipping, and the necessity for government support until at the present moment the staple supplies for the civil populations inEurope and for the armies have reached a considerable degree of consolidation. Uponthe other hand, there still exist different organs of the various Governments whichare rival customers for the same supply, and by their inner competition are forcing upprices beyond those due to the pressure of short supplies.5. The disintegrated control of supplies also represents much overlapping and loss in transport. For instance, coincident contracts made by different import agencies inthe export countries have at times resulted in alternate great transport and portcongestion at one time, and slack use of such facilities at other times. It should bepossible with a central control to somewhat mitigate these wastes and delays.6. In order to assure regularity and quantitative distribution, it is desirable to formulate long in advance the quantitative requirements of the importers, the resourcesof the exporters, and therefrom the allocation of both imports and exports amongrespective parties.
7. It appears that the first step towards better co-operation -is the early creation ofan International Board which shall have somewhat the following functions: (a.) The creation of organs for the consolidation of the purchase of each of theprincipal staples.This is no doubt most easily accomplished by the further elaborationand strengthening of the already established very efficient organs, such asthe Wheat Commission, whose operations on behalf of the whole of theconsuming Allies would be practically complete if the supply of the army were added to their functions. Such organs already partklly exist forsome staples, and need creation in others. Obviously all such organisationsshould produce as little disturbance in regular commercial activity aspossible.(6.) The determination of total quantities available from different quarters andtheir allocation among the Allies.   Some system of export permits willprobably need creation among all Allied exporters,(c.) The co-ordination of supplies so as to get the best results both from the pointof view of geographic distribution and of economy and regularity intransportation.(d.) The determination of future needs so far as may be possible in order to stimulate production in all quarters on lines which will remedy the deficiencies and effect ease of transport.(e.) The allocation of surplus imports beyond Allied needs among neutrals in such manner as will, through the appropriate agencies, secure equivalent return in shipping or other commodities from each neutral thus supplied.(/.) To organise publicity upon the needs of the importing Allies with a view tostimulating effort from the exporting Allies.(g.) To correlate food transport to shipping necessities.(h.) From a strictly American point of view, the centralisation of buying of anyparticular staple in one set of hands will promote the regulation of prices,and a knowledge of the amount of foodstuffs required by the Allies will promote any action which may be taken by the American Government witha view to control prices, stimulation of production, reduction of consumptionof special staples or the substitution of other American products for them so as to free such staples for export. It is my impression that the largerises in prices during the last few months have been due in considerable measure to the rivalry of different Allied organs in the American markets.For the stimulation of American production it is desirable that someguidance should be given to the American people as to the character ofcereals to be planted. In the direct and indirect control of Americanconsumption a great deal can be done by the way of substitution in home consumption ; for instance, the extension of the consumption of maizebread in the United States for wheat bread, and thus the production of alarger wheat surplus for export. At the present moment it is of courseimpossible for me to say what measures of price control or restriction on consumption may be undertaken in the United States ; but whether anysuch measures are undertaken or not, it appears to me that the erection ofsuch an organism as that outlined above is the essential necessary before any adequate co-operation can be entered into by the United States.8. It would be the acme of success if, as a result of co-operation, the necessity of rationing the civil poprdation in Europe could be avoided with its attendantconsumption of man-power, expense, and social difficulties.F - HERBERT HOOVER.April 14, 1917.[1365-122]D
APPENDIX II.Statement by Lord Devonport.IT is necessary to combine all Allied buying of food-stuffs from United States ofof America, Canada and elsewhere.The organisation for this purpose requires the setting up, where not already inexistence, of an executive body to buy, control, and distribute all food products onbehalf of the Allies.The bodies already existing are 1. Wheat Executive (and Wheat Commission):Appropriates the shares to each of the Allies (settled by an agreement) and buysthrough the Wheat Commission wheat, oatmeal, &amp;c, flour, maize, rice, barley,peas, and beans.2. Oats Committee:Buys oats for Allied Armies.Does not buy at present for civilian requirements.3. Meat Committee :A Board of Trade organisation managed by Sir Thos. Robinson.Buys frozen meat for the Allied Armies (excepting Russia) mainly from Australasiaand South America and South Africa.A small percentage is allocated to civilian requirements unsuitable for armyconsumption (mostly lamb and mutton).&quot; Free meat &quot; from Plate Packers, 8,000 to 10,000 tons per month.4. Sugar Commission.Buys by agreement all sugars for France, Italy, and Belgium for military and civilrequirements.A new executive body is required to deal with bacon and other hog products,cheese, lard, butter, condensed milk.A conference was held last week at the Ministry of Food.Present:Mr. Hoover.Representatives  of the  International Committee, including  Sir EdmundWyldbore Smith and Italian and Belgian delegates.To co-ordinate the operations of these executive bodies and to establish an officialchannel of communication with the United States Government in regard to food supplies it will be necessary to constitute an International Food Board. This should consist of Representatives of the Allies (including United States), and should probablyinclude a representative of the Shipping Controller.It would probably be inadvisable to include representatives of the executivebodies who would be called into conferences as might be necessary.
G.-140. APPENDIX III.Ordeb of the British Empire.(Memorandum by Lord Curzon.)ON the 9th February the War Cabinet instructed Sir E. Ponsonby&apos;s Committeeto prepare a scheme for the proposed new Order on the basis of optional knighthood,i.e., anyone receiving the two higher classes of the Order should be at liberty to decline the knighthood ordinarily associated with those classes, and should append tohis name initials which were the equivalent of knighthood, but did not carry withthem the titles &quot; Sir &quot; and &quot; Lady.&quot; When this scheme was drawn up, it was thought to he very doubtful whether the letters G.M.B.E. (i.e., Grand Member) and S.O.B.E.(i.e., Star Commander) would meet with popular acceptance, while the difficulty ofprecedence was felt to be insuperable. Anyone not a Knight could not be placed in front of those who are Knights. Accordingly, the G.M.B.E.&apos;s and S.C.B.E.&apos;s and their wives would rank below all Knights Bachelors and their wives, while those recipientsof the new Order who had elected to take a knighthood would rank above all KnightsBachelors, and would be placed at the end of the existing orders of knighthood.Confronted with this difficulty, the Cabinet instructed Sir George Cave and myself to confer with Sir E. Ponsonby&apos;s Committee, with a view to seeing whether any other solution could be found.Let it be remembered that the problem before us is to find an Order which willhe suitable for presentation to and will satisfy the following entirely different classesof persons : (a.) Foreigners, numbering probably several thousands, who have renderedvaluable service in the various theatres of war, and who do not understandand would not appreciate an Order without classes or without distinction.(b.) Persons in our own dominions or colonies who attach a good deal ofimportance to social precedence and to titular prefixes to their names.(c.) Persons of distinction at home, from Princes or Cabinet Ministers down-wards, who have done real service in connection with the war, but towhom it would be absurd to offer the style and title of Knight.(d.) Labour members and trades-unionists who would not refuse a decoration,but would, for reasons entirely honourable to themselves, abjure a title.(e.) Munition and other war workers in every sort of sphere, many of whom would not care for a title; but a probably equal, perhaps a larger, numberof whom would not care for a distinction unless it were accompanied by a *title.To found an Order which will satisfy the claims of all these conflicting partieswas the almost impossible task set before the Committee.As the result of a Conference held on the 26th March, we decided to submit two alternative schemes to the War Cabinet, for both of which there is something to besaid, but neither of which is free from objection. Objections, indeed, are inseparable from any solution that can be proposed.First Scheme. The first scheme contemplates the creation of a single decorationwhich should follow the continental practice of possessing five classes, but should carry with it no Jcnighthood. Such a decoration, in its various classes, might bebestowed upon every variety of aspirant, both at home and abroad. The nomenclaturewould be as follows : G.C.B.E. ... ... ... ... Grand Commander.G.O.B.E. ... ... ... ... Grand Officer.C.B.E. ... ... ... ... Commander.O.B.E. ... ... ... ... Officer.A.B.E. ... ... ... ... Associate.On the Continent it would give general satisfaction, because it would be in strict-accordance with foreign precedent,  while the absence of   knighthood would be
immaterial to foreigners, the majority of whom do not desire, and cannot make use ofa knighthood.The scheme possesses the further advantage that women would he elegible to it without the invention of any new title^ancL could append the same initials to their names as men. *Further, it would dispense the Crown from creating a new Order of knighthood which would probably mean the permanent addition of 500-800 fresh Knights andLadies to the establishment of Knights and Ladies in the Empire. On the otherhand, any person willing to receive a war award, but anxious to be adorned with aknighthood would not be given the Order, but could be accommodated by inclusion in one of the existing Orders of knighthood, or by being made a Knight Bachelor.Such an Order, moreover, being dissociated from knighthood, might be Conference&apos;red inits highest classes (a) on persons of the greatest distinction, e.g., a Prime Minister, or a dominion representative (General Smuts), neither of whom would accept knighthood,or on Labour Members and leaders, or on the Clergy.The drawbacks of this scheme are, of course, that it would probably not be suffiently appreciated in the dominions and colonies, where titles and socialprecedence are regarded as of great moment; and that it might cause considerabledisappointment among those classes in this country whose service in the war has notbeen wholly untinged by expectations of social preferment to come, and who would prefer a knighthood to any number of ornamental letters. If, on the other hand,knighthoods were conferred in very large numbers on war workers, the value of thenew Order would pro tanto be diminished.Second Scheme. The second scheme recognises a fundamental divergencebetween the aspirations and needs of the various classes concerned, and provides forthem by creating : (a) a new Order of knighthood for those to whom a title andprecedence are the paramount consideration; (b) a new decoration, of one class only,unaccompanied by title, and carrying no precedence, for those of either sex who hold the opposite view.(a.) The Order would be that of the British Empire with five classes : KnightsGrand Cross, or G.C.B.E. ; Knights Commanders, or K.C.B.E.; Commanders, or C.B.E.;Officers, or O.B.E. ; Associate, or A.B.E. the first two carrying knighthood. women would be admitted and would become Dames Grand Cross, e.g., Dame PenelopeStanhope, G.C.B.E., and Dame Commander, D.C.B.E. the assumption of the titlebeing optional. It would probably be tmdesirable to give them the title of &quot; Lady,&quot;because otherwise we might have &quot; Mr. Thomas Perkins, A.B.E.. and Lady Perkins,K.C.B.E.&quot; a fruitful source of domestic perturbation.(b.) The decoration would be called War Service Order (W.S.O.) if it were to be confined to the purposes and duration of the war, or National Service Order (N.S.O.)if it were to be a permanent addition to the list of British decorations.It would indeed be the equivalent for civilians to the D.S.O. for soldiers, wouldbe open to both sexes, would raise no pretence of title or precedence, and would largely depend for its distinction upon the list of first appointments and upon a none tooprofuse distribution afterwards.The advantages of this two-fold scheme have already been indicated. It would apparently provide for every need at home and abroad. On the other hand, there is acertain risk in creating two decorations for the same service : it might be founddifficult to weigh against each other the respective merits of, say, the W.S.O. and theO.B.E.; and the W.S.O. would be discredited from the start unless its superior or at least equal distinction were established.Possibly a rule of discrimination might be laid down by giving the W.S.O. to permanent officials, and the O.B.E. to persons who have been temporarily employedduring the war.The two schemes are submitted with no sort of exhilaration to the War Cabinet.YVere it not for the insatiable appetite of the British-speaking community all theworld over for titles and precedence, the first would be unhesitatingly recommended.0. of K.April 1, 1917.o
