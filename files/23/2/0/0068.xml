THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived telegrams from Brigadier-General Knox to the effect thatthe military situation in Russia had not improved, that many menof the drafts refused to obey orders to proceed to the Front, andthat daily there were large numbers of deserters from the Front.The Italian Front.  . The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the Italians had sustained heavy losses and had been compelled temporarily to suspend their offensive, owing to the lackof heavy artillery ammunition. Steps, however, were being takento accumulate a further supply of ammunition, and on its arrival the offensive would be resumed.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the 30th French Division had left the MacedonianFront en route for Thessaly, and that four Cavalry Regiments had also proceeded in advance of the Infantry to that district.Serbian Protest. 4. The   Chief   of    the    Imperial   General   Staff   read   a communication (Appendix I) from the Serbian Military Attacherelative to a contemplated offensive by the enemy on the MacedonianFront, and the effect it would have on the safety of the Allied Armyif the withdrawals from the latter towards Thessaly were continued,and requesting that orders might be given that troops were notto be taken away at the present time for the occupation of Greece.The War.Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should inform theSerbian Military Authorities that, as General Sarrail wasin. chief command of the Allied forces in Macedonia, theBritish War Cabinet was unable to issue orders to him inrespect to the dispositions of the Allied troops.Macedonia. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that he would prepare and circulate for their informationa general statement on the military situation in Macedonia.Naval Losses. 6. The First Sea Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that on the 20th May a &quot; Q &quot; ship had been sunk, but a fewsurvivors had been picked up suffering from exposure.Hospital Ships: 7. The  War  Cabinet was  reminded  that  the question of reprisals. reprisals would again be raised by the sinking of the hospital ship&quot; Dover Castle&quot; in the Mediterranean on the 26th May.In view of the apparently satisfactory progress being made inthe negotiations between the German Government, on the one hand,and the King of Spain and the Pope on cur behalf, on the other,for the inspection of hospital ships before sailing by neutral officials,and possibly the conveyance of neutral inspectors on board such vessels, the War Cabinet decided that No immediate action was necessary.
wc 150 20 2Use of Hospital 8. With reference to Paper G.T.-745, the War Cabinet decidedShiPs&apos; that-9 Hospital ships should not, in future, convey as passengers :(a.) Persons not belonging to the staff of the hospital ship which transports them, and who are being conveyedas relief for other ships ;(6.) Officers and men of the Royal Army Medical Corps ;neither should they be allowed to carry certain kinds of hospital stores, such as those only capable of being used on land,suchasambulance waggons, and which therefore cannotbe claimed as having any connection with hospital ships.The Secretary of State for War was requested to make thenecessary arrangements accordingly.Reprisals for Air q  Jt was suggested that the recent German air raid on Folke-ai s&apos; stone, Shorncliffe, and other towns, was probably an act of retaliationfor our constant air raids on Zeebrugge, Ostend, Bruges, and at . Denis Westrem. It was pointed out also that the raid on Folke-stone and Shorncliffe, -which are important military bases, and onAshford, where there are munition manufactories, was a legitimateact of war, and that, as regards Folkestone, we had no case if wecalled it an undefended town.The War Cabinet requested Lord Curzon to interview the Air Board and report what wasthe present position of affairs on the Western Front asregards the Air Service, and what German towns in thevicinity of that front could be attacked without detriment to our offensive and that of the French.H.M.S. &quot;Hilary.&quot; m  With reference to War Cabinet 147, Minute 8, the First sea lord informed the War Cabinet that H.M.S. &quot;Hilary&quot; had been lost.Enemy Submarine 11. The First Sea Lord recounted several engagements withLosses, enemy submarines, in which it wras very probable that two had been sunk. He drew the attention of the War Cabinet to the very greatdifficulty that must be experienced in stating definitely whether an action with an enemy submarine had been successful or otherwise,and instanced the case of the German submarine &quot; U. 93 &quot; (WarCabinet 1-17, Minute 6), which, after being in action and losing hercaptain, one officer, and &apos; two men, who were captured, had safelyreturned to Germany.Adjournment.12.

Education Bill. 14. The War Cabinet requested the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister for Education to discuss the provisions of the-^.Education Bill, and, if necessary, bring to their notice any points that required further consideration before the Bill was laid on the       *table of the House.The Ministry ofPensions and. theStatutoryCommittee.15. With reference to G.T.-695, dealing with the proposed transfer of the powers and the duties of the Statutory Committee tothe Ministry of Pensions, the War Cabinet decided that-As agreement had been reached between the Committee and theMinister of Pensions on the subject, a Bill should beprepared and brought forward in due course for theconsideration of the War Cabinet.Enemy PrincesBill.&quot;16. Lord Curzon informed the War Cabinet that the&apos;,Committee&apos;sReport on the Enemy Princes Bill had been laid as a ParliamentaryPaper, and he undertook to send the same to the Attorney-general for any remarks he might have to offer.Anglo-french conference,28-29thMav, 1917.17. The War Cabinet gave their formal approval to theConclusions of the Anglo-French Conference held on the 28th-29thMay, 1917.   (Appendix II.)Business of War 18. The War Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary (PaperCabinet. G.T.-857) relative to the business of the War Cabinet, and decidedthat-From Tuesday next, the 5th June, 1917, as a trial, the first half-hour, or more if found necessary, of Cabinet Meetingsshould be devoted to questions on the Agenda paper which are not quite of the first importance, after which, ata definite time, the statements of the Naval, Military, andForeign Political Advisers of the. Government should bereceived, to be followed by discussions on subjects ofpolicy of great importance.The War Cabinet further decided that If it was found necessary, a weekly clearance meeting shouldbe held&apos; on Friday afternoons.19. With reference to a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War, dated the 18th May, 1917, on the Provision of NativeLabour from Overseas (Paper G.T.-778), the War Cabinet decidedthat -The Shipping Controller should confer with the Acting Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs with a view to the presentation to the Japanese Government of a definiteproposal for the provision of the necessary shipping to convey natives recruited in China across the Pacific, their further. transport to Europe being arranged between theBritish, Canadian, and United States Governments.Pending a settlement with the Japanese Government,, the War ...Cabinet decided that  (Native labour from Overseas.China.Recruiting in China should not be stopped.
Nyasa and 20. As regards the question of obtaining labour in West AfricaMozambique. an(j transporting the same -to East Africa, the War Cabinet tookinto consideration a telegram which had been received from theGovernor-General of the Union of South Africa by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, dated the 28th May, 1917 (Appendix III), and directed The Secretary of State for War to examine the question and to draft a telegram for the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to send to the Portuguese Government,urging them to authorise the Witwatersrand Native LabourAssociation to start recruiting at once in the Nyasa andMozambique Provinces, for service with the East AfricanExpeditionary Force.India.21. With regard to the note by the Secretary of State for India,dated the 15th May, 1917 (Paper G.T.-729), with reference to WarCabinet 136, Minute 9, the War Cabinet decided that Further recruiting in India for labour battalions and lumbermenwas to cease for the present, on account of the impossibility of providing the necessary shipping.Austrian Prisoners. 22. The question was raised of bringing Austrian prisoners from Italy with a view to utilising them for labour purposes inFrance and the United Kingdom, and the War Cabinet decidedthat The Secretary of State for War should go carefully into thisquestion with Lord Newton, and forward a draft telegram to Lord Robert Cecil for transmission to the Italian andFrench Governnients, reporting to the War Cabinet in due course the result of the negotiations.Sulphate of ammonia.23. With reference to a Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries, in connection with the manu-facture, storage, and distribution of sulphate of ammonia for the season 1917-18 (Appendix IV), the War Cabinet approved theproposals contained therein. -Restriction ofShipping to the atlantic.24. With reference to the AVar Cabinet 137, Minute 10, the WarCabinet considered the Report (Paper G.T.-773) (Appendix V) ofthe Committee detailed to enquire into the question of shippingstrategy in the Atlantic, &amp;c, and approved, in principle, the proposal.to concentrate as far as possible our trade on the Morth Atlanticroutes up to the maximum output of. our essential requirements fromthe North American Atlantic ports, but decided that This policy should not be disclosed to any of our Dominions, toIndia, nor to our Allies until the machinery for purchasing,&amp;c, Was in working order.The War Cabinet further decided that (a.) Each purchasing Department should at once take thenecessary preliminary steps to procure * its further supplies as far as possible from the United States and canada, and limit its commitments in other markets tothe lowest possible level.[1365-150] C
(6.) The details of these several requirements should hefurnished as soon as possible to the Tonnage priority committee, which should take the necessary action to concentrate the demand on America.(c.) This Committee, in conjunction with the Board of Trade,should also take the necessary steps similarly to divertthe private demand for commodities into the samechannel as far as is practicable.(d.) The Committee, under the Presidency of Sir H. BabingtonSmith, already appointed by the President of the Boardof Trade to enquire into our exports generaUy, should consider and report in due course the effect of thisdiversion of trade, and at the same time forward any recommendations they may wish to offer with regard toimportant export industries suffering as little as possible.This Committee should also report on any questions of restrictions of imports from Allied countries that may arise owing to this proposed concentration of trade. -(e.) As this concentration of shipping must to a large extentdetrimentally affect the import and export trade of Indiaand the Dominions, the Secretary of State for India andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies should, after receiving from the departments concerned the anticipatedreduction in their commitments in markets other thanthe United States of America and Canada (see b),render, through the Committee referred to in paragraph(d), a report for the consideration of the War cabinet as to what relief or other action (if any) is recommended.(/.) With regard to the proposal to create a reserve of shipping,this matter should be considered by the War Cabinet intwo months&apos; time.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 30, 1917.
APPENDIX I.e - -Note sent by the Serbian Military Attache in London to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.THE Serbian Military Attache has received to-day the following telegram fromhis Headqitarters : &quot; The Commander of the Allied forces, General Sarrail, has informed SerbianHeadquarters that there are reasons to suppose that the enemy contemplates an offensive on the Macedonian front, and he orders that all necessary steps shall be takento prevent the success of such an offensive. At the same time that the enemy&apos;soffensive is regarded as most probable, the Commander of the British force hasreceived instructions to send a detachment of 500 men to General Sarrail for operations against Greece. General Sarrail has given an order that the following troops shall be withdrawn from the Macedonian front : &quot; 30th (French) Division.&quot; Part of the 11th (French) Division.&quot; 2nd (Russian) Brigade.&quot; Two regiments of African Fusiliers.&quot; One regiment of Moroccan Cavalry (five squadrons).&quot; It is intended to use these troops also against Greece. He is weakening that portionof the front where the enemy&apos;s offensive is most probable. If the enemy carries out a successful offensive on the Macedonian front, it would have a very grave effect on the1st Serbian Army, which has only one line of communication, and that one alreadyendangered by the enemy. This Army would not have even a possibility of escape, asit is in a mountainous country.&quot;The Serbian Military Attache has the honour to inform the War Office of therequest of the Serbian Headquarters, and begs that an order may be given that troopsmay not be taken away at the present time for an occupation of Greece, but that a concentration of all Allied forces may be effected for a new offensive on this front ata suitable opportunity, as well as for defensive measures against an offensive on thepart of the enemy.The Serbian Military Attache would be very much obliged for an early replystating the decision of the War Office in this matter.May 29, 1917.APPENDIX II.I.C.-22.  -.-General Conclusions of an Anglo-French Conference held at 10, Downing Street,London, on May 28 and 29, 1917.THE French and British Government being in agreement that it is essential forthe safety of the Allied force at Salonica that King Constantine should cease to reignin Athens, and that this object should, if possible, be accomplished without war with greece or other additional strain on our shipping resources, the following resolutions were arrived at: -1. Immediate steps to be taken by General Sarrail to establish the military posts in Thessaly required to secure the control of the harvest. Instructions tobe given to General Sarrail by the French Government to &quot;carry out theestablishment of these posts in the most conciliatory and unprovocativemanner possible. Simultaneous steps to be taken by M. Jonnart for thepurchase of the Thessalian harvest.2. General Sarrail to hold troops in readiness to proceed to the Isthmus ofCorinth in case of necessity.3, As soon as the military posts for the control of the Thessalian harvest havebeen established, the Allies, through M. Jonnart, to demand the abdication
and withdrawal of King Constantine on the grounds that, as guaranteeingPowers for the Treaty of 1863, they can no longer tolerate the division offGreece into two parts, nor his continued violation of the constitution bygoverning as absolute monarch.4. If King Constantine declines to abdicate a complete blockade to be established in order to secure his submission.5. If King Constantine moves his troops for the purpose of resisting the Allies inThessaly General Sarrail to be at liberty to send a force for the occupationof the Isthmus of Corinth. The British Government assents to theco-operation of a nominal British contingent if this operation should become necessary on the understanding that, in the event of complicationsarising, the French Government will not call upon the British Governmentfor any further naval or military assistance, direct or indirect, beyond theoriginal contingent, arid that no demand will be made&apos; on the BritishGovernment for transport beyond the four vessels at present lent to theFrench Government, which shall remain at their disposal during these operations.6. No further withdrawal of troops from Salonica to be carried out before theexpiration of six weeks, commencing the 1st June. A further conference between Great Britain and France to take place not later than the 1st Julyin regard to the method of further withdrawals of troops, and the other allies to be consulted on the point.7. A conference of shipping experts of France, Great Britain, and Italy to takeplace before the conference mentioned in the preceding clause in order toexamine fully the whole shipping situation.8. M. Jonnart to be High Commissioner for Allied purposes in Greece, repre-sentirig France and Great Britain, and, if they will agree, Russia and italy as well.   In all political matters General Sarrail is to act under his orders.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 29, 1917.APPENDIX III.Telegram from the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies dated May 28, 1917.MY telegram of 4th May.It appears from further reports, details of which General Hoskins will no doubt-communicate to His Majesty&apos;s Government, that if the whole Nyasa province were opened to recruiting probably 10,000 porters could be obtained, and that Mozambiqueprovince wOuld yield further 15,000 porters.&apos; Except on instructions from Lisbon, local Portuguese authorities will do nothing to extend area open for recruiting, but under German pressure they are said to bebecoming more inclined to help.I find reason to modify objections (2) and (3) mentioned in my telegram of 4th May.As regards (2) 1 understand that Witwatersrand Native Labour Association are confident that they can obtain natives who refuse to work for Portuguese. As to (3) it appearspossible by working from Porto Amelia to avoid area occupied by Portuguese troops,and in any case interference considered unlikely as recruiting officers would holdBritish commissioned rank.There is further consideration that Germans now advancing into Portugueseterritory will probably obtain natives if we fail to&apos; recruit them.Witwatersrand Native Labour Association have organisation ready to startrecruiting at once if permission is obtained by His Majesty&apos;s Government fromPortuguese Government to extend area.-Buxton.
APPENDIX IV.Sulphate of Ammonia.IT is desirable to arrange a scheme for the manufacture, storage, and distributionof sulphate of ammonia for the season June 1917 to May 1918.The Ministry of Munitions controls the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia ; the boards of Agriculture (England, Scotland, and Ireland) control its distribution. Theinterests of manufacturers, munitions, and agriculture are to some, extent opposed.Munitions want the ammonia manufactured and sold freely, so as to avoid the difficttltiesof storage. Manufacturers want to clear their stocks rapidly, and for this purpose tobe allowed to export at high profits. Agriculture wants ammonia stored during the summer, autumn, and winter for use during the months from January to April 1918.It is the question of storage which is the great difficulty.The output of ammonia for 1917-18 is calculated at about 430,000 tons. Of this quantity, munitions take approximately H00,000 tons, leaving 230,000 tons for agriculture.   It is calculated that we could use 280,000 tons.On the 9th February, 1917, the War Cabinet decided that 200,000 tons ofsulphate of ammonia should be made available for agriculture at 15L 10s. ex works,or 161. per ton delivered, and sanctioned the expenditure of 10s. a ton for railway charges, &amp;c, so as to secure delivery at the price of 161. in whatever part of theUnited Kingdom the order was executed.No time limit was fixed, and of the quantity allocated under this decision about80,000 tons will have been used by the end of May.In order to get over the difficulty of storage and to provide for a supply of sulphate of ammonia for agriculture in the months from January to April 1918, when it is used,the following scheme is suggested : 1. That exports should be prohibited except in the national interest.2. That a sliding scale of prices for sulphate of ammonia should be so arranged as to tempt manure mixers, dealers, and farmers to buy in the summer orautumn so as to relieve storage.3. That the prices should work out over the whole year at 15L 10s. ex works, andmight, for example, be arranged as follows : June to September 1917 : 14Z. 17s. 6d. per ton.October to December 1917 : 151. 7s. 6d. per ton.January to May 1918 : 15L 15s.Whatever export was allowed in the national interest should be allowed in the period from June to December 1917.4. That the allowance of 10s. per ton for distribution should be continued by theGovernment.5. That a Distribution Committee should be set up to provide facilities for distribution, consisting of representatives of the three agricultural departments of the United Kingdom and of the sulphate of ammoniatrade.In order to secure the sale of stocks which may be held up by manufacturers,the Food Production Department of the Board of Agriculture should be empoweredto apply to the Ministry of Munitions to requisition the sale of ammonia at the pricesnamed.R. E. PROTHERO.[1365-150]D
APPENDIX V.G.T.-773.--Report of a Committee on our proposed Shipping Strategy in the Atlantic.IN accordance with, the directions of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 137,Minnte 10), the proposals made by Sir Leo Chiozza Money, M.P. (Papers G.T.-660,dated the 4th May, 1917; G.T.-698, dated the 7th May, 1917 ; G.T.-711, dated the11th May, .1917), and a Memorandum (Paper G.T.-697, dated the 10th May, 1917) bythe Shipping Controller, were considered by a Committee composed of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe.Sir Joseph Maclay (Shipping Controller).Sir Leo Chiozza Money, M.P., Ministry of Shipping.Sir Kenneth Anderson, Ministry of Shipping.Sir H. Babington Smith, Board of Trade.Professor Chapman, Board of Trade.Piear-Admiral Duff, Admiralty.Captain Webb, R.N., Admiralty.Mr. Fielding, Ministry of Munitions.The Admiralty representatives expressed their strong view that the proposal to concentrate trade to the greatest possible extent on North Atlantic routes was onewhich would afford very great relief to our present overstrained naval resources, andwould also greatly facilitate the adoption of the convoy system, and the Committee,after considering the question, decided to recommend its immediate acceptance inprinciple. The steps which it is necessary should be taken to put the scheme intoforce are detailed below : 1. The Purchase of Supplies in America (a.) Each purchasing department to be immediately instructed to procure itsfurther supplies from the United States and Canada, and to limit its commitments inother markets to the lowest possible level.(6.) Machinery already exists for the co-ordination of departmental requirements in the Tonnage Priority Committee, and this body could efficiently perform the function of concentrating demand upon America. Practical difficulties could be discussed andsettled and questions of substitution disposed of.(c.) The Tonnage Priority Committee and/or the Board of Trade could ensurethat private demand for commodities is directed into the proper channel.   Privatedemand, however, has now reached a very low level.   The facts are that the TonnaePriority Committee has allocated 92 per cent,  of  the   available tonnage to threquirements of (a) the Food Controller, (o) the War Office, (c) the Admiralty, (d) the timber Controller, and (e) the Minister of Munitions.2. Action in and by America. The co-operation of the American Government isessential. The presence of Mr. Balfour in America enables us to broach the schemeimmediately. When Mr. Balfour leaves it would be essential that some gentlemancarrying great weight preferably a Cabinet Minister should go to the United states in order that he might undertake the task of safeguarding the scheme on the Americanside. Fie might well be accompanied by a commission of experts from the various departments.3. The commercial interest of America runs with the scheme, and there is noreason to apprehend that there would be any difficulty in that respect. It is, however,important that the American Government should arrange that the large domestic demand in America for steel, &amp;c, is not allowed to swamp war requirements.4. It would be necessary to reorganise North American Atlantic ports, arranging for day and night shifts, improved railway facilities, &amp;c.5. Port Work Here. A strong Port Department in the Ministry of shipping is being more and more developed to deal with matters in the United Kingdom. Thedevelopment of railway facilities is also being reviewed.6. Reserve of Ships. The formation of. a reserve of shipping deserves serious consideration, and its practicability should be considered in detail as soon as thescheme fructifies.
iiWC 1507. Export Trade. The effect on the export trade of the proposed diversion ofshipping to the North Atlantic routes should be fully considered in order to secure that important export industries may suffer as little as practicable. It is suggested that acommittee, similarly constituted to- the Restriction of Imports Committee, whichrecently sat under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Babington Smith, might well beentrusted with the consideration of exports in detail.8. India and the Dominions. In regard to India and the Dominions, the problem is largely financial. A certain amount of import and export trade must necessarilycontinue.(Signed) J. R. JELLICOE.J. P.
