APPENDIX I.I AGREE with the above on the understanding that, while I am fully determined to carry out the Calais Agreement in spirit and letter, the British Army andits Commander-in-Chief will he regarded by General Nivelle as Allies and not assubordinates, except during the particular operations which he explained at the CalaisConference.Further, while I also accept the Agreement respecting the functions of the british mission at French Headquarters, it should be understood that these functions may besubject to modifications as experience shows to be necessary.D. HAIG, F. M.APPENDIX II.Baghdad.Telegram to Viceroy, Foreign Department, dated March 12, 1917.&quot;(GT.-150.)(Repeated to Sir P. Cox, Basra.)WAR Cabinet wish following proclamation to be issued by Maude without delay.It requires careful and literary translation in view of wide publicity which it will have in Arabic speaking world : &quot; To the People of Baghdad :&quot; 1. In the name of my King and in the name of the peoples over whom he rules, Iaddress you as follows : &quot; 2. Our military operations have as their object the defeat of the enemy, and thedriving of him from these territories. In order to complete this task, I am chargedwith absolute and supreme control of all regions in which British troops operate, but our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but asliberators.&quot; 3. Since the days of Halaka your city and your lands have been subject to thetyranny of strangers, your palaces have fallen into ruins, your gardens have sunken indesolation, and your forefathers and yourselves have groaned in bondage. Your sonshave been carried oil&apos; to wars not of your seeking, your wealth has been stripped from you by unjust men and squandered in distant places.&quot; 4. Since the days of Midhat, the Turks have talked of reforms, yet do not the ruinsand wastes of to-day testify the vanity of those promises ?&quot; 5. It is the wish not only of my King and his peoples, but it is also the wish ofthe great nations with whom he is in alliance, that you should prosper even as in thepast, when your lands were fertile, when your ancestors gave to the world literature,science, and art, and when Baghdad city was one of the wonders of the world.&quot; 6. Between your people and the dominions of my King there has been a closebond of interest. For 200 years have the merchants of Baghdad and Great Britaintraded together in mutual profit and friendship. On the other hand, the Germans andTurks who have despoiled you and yours, have, for twenty years, made Baghdad a centre of power from which to assail the power of the British and theAllies of the British in Persia and Arabia, therefore the British government cannot remain indifferent as to what takes place in your country now or in the future,for in duty to the interests of the British people and their Allies the British government cannot risk that being done in Baghdad again which has-been done by the Turks and germans during the war.&quot; 7. But you people of Baghdad, whose commercial prosperity and whose safetyfrom oppression and invasion must ever be a matter of the closest concern to theBritish Government, are not to understand that it is the wish of the BritishGovernment to impose upon you alien institutions. It is the hope of the BritishGovernment that the aspirations of your philosophers and writers shall be realised,-and that once again the people of Baghdad shall flourish, enjoying their wealth and
substance under institutions which are in consonance with their sacred laws and their -racial ideals. In Hejaz the Arabs have expelled the Turks and Germans who oppressedthem and proclaimed the Sherif Hussein as their King, and his Lordship rules inindependence and freedom and is the ally of the nations who are fighting against thepower of Turkey and Germany ; so, indeed, are the noble Arabs, the Lords of Koweit,Nejd, and A sir.&quot; 8. Many noble Arabs have perished in the cause of Arab freedom at the hands ofthose alien rulers, the Turks, who oppressed them. It is the determination of theGovernment of Great Britain and the Great Powers allied to Great Britain that thesenoble Arabs shall not have suffered in vain. It is the hope and desire of the british people and the nations in alliance with them that the Arab race may rise once more togreatness and renown among the peoples of the earth, and that it shall bind itselftogether to this end in unity and concord.&quot; 9. 0 people of Baghdad, remember that for 26 generations you have suffered understrange tyrants who have ever endeavoured to set one Arab house against another inorder that they might profit by your dissensions. This policy is abhorrent to GreatBritain and her Allies, for there can be neither peace nor prosperity where there isenmity and misgovernment. Therefore I am commanded to invite you, through yournobles and elders and representatives, to participate in the management of your civil affairs in collaboration with the political representatives of Great Britain who accompany the British army, so that you may be united with your kinsmen in north, east, south,and west in realising the aspirations of your race.&quot;o
