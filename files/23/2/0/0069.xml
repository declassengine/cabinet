Store, Assistant Secretary.Order of theBritish Empire.1. THE War Cabinet decided to recommend to the King thatno list of honours in connection with the Order of the BritishEmpire should be issued on the King&apos;s Birthday, but that anannouncement should be made that the list will be issued shortly.In the meanwhile, it was agreed that Lord Curzon, Mr. Barnes,and Dr. Addison should scrutinise the list of names to be submitted.CompulsoryRationing.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFood Controller in regard to the machinery for the distribution and rationing of food (Paper G.-149).- 20 7 \Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1017.
Control andDistribution of foodstuffs.Lord Milner stated that, as requested by the War Cabinet (WarCabinet 133, Minute 8), he had, in concert with Mr. Henderson andthe Food Controller, investigated the question of compulsoryrationing, with the result that they had come to the. conclusion thatcompulsory rationing was undesirable at present.The War Cabinet, particularly in view of the report of theShipping Controller on the same morning in regard to thearrangement for the importation of foodstuffs, confirmed thisdecision.3. Lord Milner stated that in the course of their investigationthe Sub-Committee had ascertained that there were many defects in distribution of foodstuffs, more particularly in regard to sugar.They recommended that Food Commissioners should be appointedby the Local Authorities, charged in the first instance with theelaboration of machinery for the rationing of sugar, and for thecollection of a census of stocks of sugar. The cost of this schemewas estimated at 200,0001. as compared with 700,OOOZ. for com-pulsory rationing.The War Cabinet recognises that this scheme would provide a nucleus for the development at a later stage of a scheme of com-pulsory rationing if this should become absolutely necessary.They approved  he scheme, subject, however, to the agreementof the new Food Controller in the event of a fresh appointment beingmade.Tobacco Control.4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade on tobacco control (Paper G-T-846).   They decided-To adopt the proposals contained in this memorandum on theunderstanding that the sale and consumption of tobaccoshould not be limited at a figure lower than the 1916 level.Unity of Controlof transport facilities in theUnited States ofAmerica.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration the question ofthe organisation in the United States for the control, of movements of supplies of all kinds by rail to the ports and * by sea from the ports.The Shipping Controller urged that at the moment our greatneed was to build -up a reserve of foodstuffs, and pointed out thatthe Munition requirements from America were going down. he drew attention to Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram of 17th. May, in which mr. Balfour recommended that Captain Guthrie should beappointed chairman of a Traffic Executive Committee.The Minister of Munitions, however, stated that certain delayshad been due to the fact that,, in order not to hold up tonnage, theMinistry of Munitions had formed dumps in the ports. Owing to thefailure to organise the railway communications for grainstuffs,sufficient grain to fill the ships was not available, and the ships, inorder to avoid delay, had been filled up with munitions. He gavereasons for his belief that Captain Guthrie, though no doubt a com-petent shipping agent, was not equal to the supervision of therailway transport as well as of shipping.The failure to ship the full quantity of grain during May was explained by the Shipping Controller as being due to special reasons, which in no way concerned Captain Guthrie.The President of the Board of Trade was in favour of theappointment of one of the American railway presidents to take charge of railway transport in the United States of America.Mr. Beale, of the Wheat Commission, laid great stress on theimportance of adequate arrangements being made for the Juneshipment of wheat with a view to the building up of a reserve.
Priority of! 6. Lord Milner made a preliminary report on the investigationsShipping-! undertaken by him into the question of the priority of shipping(War Cabinet 126, Minute 6 (6) ). He submitted a programme forthe month of June (Appendix), and the War Cabinet decidedthat This programme should be adopted as a standard to which theDepartments should work as nearly as possible.British Representa- 7. With reference to War Cabinet 147, Minute 10, the Wartion in the United    Cabinet had before them a telegram from Mr. Balfour from Ottawa,States of America.    dated the 28th May, in regard to the proposed appointment of lord northcliffe.Lord Robert Cecil having reported that Mr. Page, the UnitedStates Ambassador in London, was enthusiastically in favour of thesuggestion that Lord Northcliffe should be appointed, the WarCabinet decided that The Prime Minister should invite Lord Northcliffe to proceedto the United States of America, not as a diplomatic repre-sentative, but as the Head of the Mission representing the, different  Departments   concerned,  for  the  purpose  ofco-ordinating their action.JapaneseDestroyersfor EuropeanWaters.8. The War Cabinet took note of a telegram from ViscountMotono, dated the 27th May, 1917, which had been received from,the Japanese Embassy in London, to the effect that the JapaneseGovernment had decided to send to European waters anotherdetachment of four destroyers.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 31, 1917,The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Shipping should send a telegram to CaptainGuthrie in the following sense : &quot; The War Cabinet have decided that you act as chairman of Traffic Executive Committee, but thatyou appoint an eminent American railway man to bethe Committee&apos;s Executive Officer in control of railwaytransport.&quot;The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform mr. Balfour and the British Ambassador at Washington ofthis decision.

20WC 151APPENDIX.Ministry of Shipping : Tonnage Priority Committee.Report by the Chairman, with a Statistical Statement for June 1917, Showing whatCargo it is Proposed to Carry with the Tonnage Available, April 28, 1917.1. AT the third meeting of the Tonnage Priority Committee held on the25th April, 1917, it was agreed that I should prepare a statement showing how thedemands of the various Departments for imports could best be satisfied by the tonnage available, and embodying  (a.) Reductions generally agreed to by the Committee.(b.) Proposals for reduction for which individual Departments could not acceptcomplete responsibility, and which therefore needed to be referred to theWar Cabinet for decision.2. The earliest month for which it is practicable to make a complete review ofthe situation for the purposes of tonnage priority is June, for the shipments of Mayhave been for the most part already arranged. It is useful in the first place to show how imports have adjusted themselves without the intervention of the Committee.The Trade Accounts for April have not yet been published, but those for March maybe quoted as indicating the directions in which shortages of imports have actuallyoccurred. The figures of April and May will doubtless show very similar results inview of the importations taking place under conditions of partial control.3. In March 1917 our estimated imports by quantity amounted to 2,503,000 tons,as compared with 3,567,000 tons in March 1916, a decrease of no less than 1,164,000tons.   In the following statement a comparative analysis is given :  Estimated Imports in March 1916 and^ 1917 (in Tons).Group.March 1916.March 1917.Increase or decrease.I. Food, Drink, Tobacco (a.)

4. It will be seen that a very serious fall occurred in the importations of food, thedecline being from 1,42(3,000 tons to 1,030,000 tons. In grain and flour alone the fallwas from 864,000 tons to 657,000 tons. There was also a serious fall in raw materials,the most important from the point of view of war requirements being that in iron ore,from 570,000 tons to 496,000 tons. A large part of the fall in raw materials, althoughinjurious to trade, did not directly concern the war and was in part the resultof deliberate restriction. The same observation applies to the considerable fall in theimportation of manufactured articles.5. Consideration of the foregoing table, while it is reassuring as showing that nosmall part of the fall in imports has been in what may be called unessentials in time ofwar, shows also the urgent need for a greater measure of import control, especially inrelation to foodstuffs. It has to be remembered that the expression &quot; restriction ofimports &quot; is in some respects a misleading term in existing circumstances. imports are being restricted by reason of the fact that the ships do not exist to carry our normal inward cargoes, and what we have really to do is not to restrict imports, but fodecide of what the imports, as restricted by the shortage of tonnage, shall be composed.It is the work of the Tonnage Priority Committee to co-ordinate the various import requirements to ensure that the nation shall receive those things which it most needs.6. In accordance with the decision of the Committee the appended statement hasbeen prepared which balances imports demands and tonnage available for the monthof June. (At the next meeting of the Committee, which will be held very shortly, theimports of July will be taken into detailed consideration.) Summarising the Juneresults in the briefest possible form, the figures show : Summary of the Tonnage Priority Statement for June 1017.	Demand.	Proposed to be Carried.	Increase or Decrease.Pood Controller.. Timber Controller          . . / War Office Ministry of Munitions Admiralty Board of Trade Total imports in June 1917 ..

It is estimated that in June about 3,000,000 tons of cargo Can be imported intothe United Kingdom in the British and foreign ships available, giving a balance inhand of 116,800 tons,,as compared with the 2,881,000 tons, or cargo proposed to becarried in the above table. This small working margin is probably less than the lossarising from the difference between working out theoretical cargoes on paper and theactual operation of effective lifting of cargo.8. As to food, tiie statement provides tonnage for practically the whole of thedemand of the Food Controller, the small balance consisting of unessential commoditiesfor which the Ministry of Food does not press. As to the most important item, cereals,the 1,149,000 tons of grain proposed to be carried will, it is hoped, form a record fora month&apos;s shipment of grain. It includes the whole of the June demand plus one-thirdof the deficiency to the end of May needed to be made up to give us thirteen weeks&apos;normal supply. It is hoped&quot; to make up the remainder of the deficiency in July and august so that at the end of the latter month the country wTould possess thirteenweeks&apos;&apos; stock of wdreat. It has to be; observed, however,, that it would appear from thelatest statement of the Ministry of Food that the normal consumption of bread is beingexceeded, and if this continues the purpose of obtaining an augmented supply will be defeated.9. As to timber, the statement goes upon the tentative decision of the WarCabinet that the Shipping Controller was for the present not to furnish further tonnage for the carriage of timber.10. As to the War Office demand, this consists of an exceedingly large number ofdiverse articles, including wool, jute,, hides, and leather both for Army and civilian purposes.   In all it amounts to a very small portion of the total requirements.
.11. As to munitions supplies, the Minister of Munitions has, I understand, agreedto abate his total demand by 20 per cent. The details of the reductions are not shown, but are being worked out by the Ministry of Munitions. It may be observed,however, that the demand for iron ore, 735,000 tons, largely exceeds the amountbrought into this country in any month of last year, when the average imports of iron ore amounted to 580,000 tons, and were in March 570,000 tons.12. As to oils and fats, which are controlled by the Ministry of Munitions, these imports are not only for glycerine purposes for explosives, but also for our margarinemakers. At the end of .1916 the War Trade Advisory Committee, which set up theOils and Fats Committee to watch the imports and stocks of oleaginous produce, was informed by this Sub-Committee that there existed a stock&apos; in the country equal toabout nine months&apos; supply. I have now been informed that this stock has declined to five months&apos; supply, which is somewhat surprising. In view of this decrease, andof the great importance of oils and fats for both munitions and food, it is suggestedhere that it is Very necessary to limit the wraste or undue consumption of these commodities.13. As to the Admiralty requisition, this is, in point of quantity, an almostnegligible part of the Avhole.   It does not call for comment.14. As to the Board of Trade figures, it will be seen that these are mainly made up of three articles cotton, mineral oil, and paper. As further reductions of importswill certainly be necessary in succeeding months as tonnage declines, it is hoped thatthe Board of Trade will be able to make such arrangements as will enable us to cutthese imports down considerably after June. As to paper especially, it is pointed outthat enormous waste is still apparent on every hand, and that most of the newspapersand journals are still published without reduction of size. The use of circulars, manyof them upon most trivial subjects, is still exceedingly great.15. This report is being circulated to the various -Departments in order to give them an opportunity of expressing their views if they differ from the scheme whichhas been set out. Each Department is invited to furnish a Memorandum expressingany such differences, in order that these, together with this report, may be placed before the War Cabinet for the decision of outstanding points.LEO CHIOZZA MONEY.April 28, 1917.Statement of the Tonnage Position for June, 1917, showing the Demands for CargoSpace and the Proposed Modifications to meet the Tonnage Available.

Lubricating oils are not included.Total Ministry of Munitions demand&apos;has been reduced by 20 per cent., thedistribution of the reduction amongthe different commodities being leftto the Ministry. It is understoodthat the Minister of Munitions agrees-to this reduction.In future months it will be necessaryagain to reduce cotton and paperimports, and it is suggested that theBoard of Trade should at once proceedto make the necessary arrangements with the trades concerned.The cargo which can be carried thusexceeds the aggregate of column (B)by 116,800 tons. This margin is prob-ably less than the loss arising fromthe difference between theoreticaltonnage estimates and the effectualcarrying of goods iu the ships avail-able.O
