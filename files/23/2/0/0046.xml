The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that themilitary situation in Russia had not improved, and that a wave ofpacifism was spreading over the army.

East Africa.3. In reference to War Cabinet 124, Minute 4, the Chief of theImperial General Staff stated that General Smuts had ascertained  -that General van Deventer was willing to accept the Chief Com-&apos;mand of the British Forces in East Africa.* -The War Cabinet approved the appointment.General Smuts. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that general smuts&apos; treatment of the troops in East Africa had apparently beenthe subject of a Court of Enquiry, which had been the result oflabour and political agitation in South Africa. The receipt of theproceedings of the Court of Enquiry was awaited by the War Office.Salonica.Submarines.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested thedesirability of considering the Salonica and Greek question beforethe approaching Paris Conference. He pointed out that, accordingto the amount of sea transport which could be made available, itwould take some six or seven months to withdraw our troops from Salonica, and that it was necessary, therefore, that we should beginat once. We had been waiting for nearly a month for general sarrail&apos;s so-called offensive, and now learned that he was preparing to take military action in Greece.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff proposed that at theConference the French Government should be informed that wecould not possibly continue to keep our present forces at Salonica,and that we proposed to bring away the two Brigades of mountedtroops and one Division forthwith : this to be followed by the wholeor greater part of the remainder so soon as shipping could be madeavailable.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff further suggested thatthe preliminary orders for shipping for the above moves should beissued at once.In reference to this question the Prime Minister stated that hehad arranged on the previous day for the First Sea Lord to accompanyhim to Paris to attend the Conference, in order that he might explain&apos;personally to the French Government the extreme gravity of theshipping situation and the influence of the Salonica Expeditionthereon,The question of the withdrawal of the British Forces was post-poned for further consideration, i6. The First Sea Lord reported a large number of engagements with enemy submarines during the previous few days, in several ofwhich the submarines were believed to have been sunk.The United Statesof America:Destroyers.Publication ofTonnage ofShipping Losses.7. The First Sea Lord stated that six American destroyers were due to arrive at Queenstown from the United States on the 2nd May ;that six more were due to leave America on the 3rd May; and that afurther six, together with a parent ship, were to sail a little later,making altogether 18 the number promised.8. In reference to War Cabinet 99, Minute 14, the War cabinet had a short discussion on the question of the publication of thetonnage figures for the losses of merchant shipping.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he and the FirstLord of the Admiralty had met a deputation on the subject headed&apos;by Mr. Runciman, at which the criticism had been made that theinformation given by the Government was deceptive, insomuch asthe published figures of the total arrivals and departures includedrepeated short voyages of small vessels, as well as the arrivals and
departures of Allied and neutral ships, whereas the figures for losses were for British vessels only. He had replied that the reasonagainst publication of more information than was being given whichappealed most strongly to him was that the losses might eventuallybecome so serious that it would be impossible to make them known.This view had impressed the deputation, but the feeling that more information should be given still existed.The Prime Minister said that, in his &apos; opinion, the figurespublished by the Germans were believed neither by our Allies norby the neutrals ; but that if we published the full figures they wouldbe generally believed and would have a very depressing, if not actually dangerous, effect on neutrals, and also on some of theAllies.On the other hand, it was pointed out that in this countrypeople were beginning to realise the seriousness of the situation, andwere inclined to suspect the Government of concealing the facts.Lord Robert Cecil, speaking for the Foreign Office, stated thatthe situation in the countries allied to us was, in his opinion,disquieting, more particularly in the case of Russia, where theSocialists were getting the upper hand, and that it was notreassuring in France, Greece, or Italy. He therefore deprecatedpublishing full information, as it might easily lead to panic and a dangerous weakening of determination in those countries tocontinue the war.Further discussion on the question of publication was adjourned,but the War Cabinet decided that A full statement of all the facts in regard to the submarinesituation should be made at the forthcoming secret session in the House of Commons.proposed conference withthe FrenchGovernment.9. In reference to the proposed Conference in Paris with theFrench Government, the War Cabinet decided That the following subjects should be discussed : The western front, Salonica, and Greece.That Lord Robert Cecil should send a telegram to the FrenchGovernment to say that the British Government would berepresented at the Conference on Friday, the 4th May,1917, by-The Prime Minister,Lord Robert Cecil,The First Sea Lord,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig,Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M. Hankey.Horse Ships. 10. The Secretary of State for War reported that all the shipsused for conveying horses from America woidd be at once released for the carriage of wheat. &apos;,Italian Aspirationsin Asia Minor.ft)[1365-11. In reference to War Cabinet 126, Minute 10, and ForeignOffice telegram No. 748 to Sir R. Rodd, Lord Robert Cecil pointed outthat the ItalianGoA^ernment was placed in a somewhat difficult positionowing to the fact that it did not know the nature of the increasedeffort that the Italians were expected to make. The question hadbeen left for discussion between the military authorities of the twocountries, but whereas Baron Sonnino appeared to consider that theincreased effort was required in Turkey, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff was known to have no desire for Italian co-operation.(General Robertson confirmed this view.)    A conversation which128] B .2
Lord Robert Cecil had recently held with the Italian ambassador had confirmed the suspicion expressed on the 25th April (WarCabinet 126, Minute 12) that there had been some understanding between the French and Italians, whereby Italy was to acquiesce*ina free hand to France in Greece, while the French would supportthe Italian claims in Asia Minor.It was suggested that as the question of the withdrawal of theBritish Forces from Salonica could not well be settled at the paris conference without the knowledge of the Italians, who were interested to some extent, it might be advisable to invite theItalian Government to send a representative to attend. It waspointed out, however, that the Italians were concerned only in oneof the three subjects to be discussed, and that the Italian ambassador in Paris might represent his Government.The OverlandRoute to Salonica.12. In reference to War Cabinet 116, Minute 16, the Secretaryof State for War reported that the overland route to Salonica viaTaranto would be ready for a traffic of one troop train a day in three weeks&apos;time, and he thought that it was possible that it mightcarry two troop trains a day.Military Policy.13. The War Cabinet commenced a discussion on the subjectof the military policy of the Allies, and the attitude in regard tothis question to be adopted by the representatives of the BritishGovernment at the forthcoming Inter-Ally Conference at Paris.[The Minutes of this highly secret discussion, which was continued in the afternoon, are recorded separately, andwill not, for the present, be printed.]The Budget.&quot;Farmers&apos; IncomeTax.II. The Chancellor of the Exchequer put forward certain proposals altering the existing method of assessment to Income Taxof farmers, and explained that by these means he hoped that therevenue would gain some 300,OOOZ. He had consulted the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries in framing these proposals.The Prime Minister said that, in his opinion, the total advantage to the revenue would not be worth the trouble and iU-feeling causedby the suggested alteration.The War Cabinet decided that The proposed alterations in the method of the assessment toIncome Tax of farmers should not be adopted.Increase of 15. The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that, sinceTobacco Duty. there had been no falling off in the consumption of tobacco during*       the previous year, his intention was to make the same increase inthe Tobacco Duty as had been imposed in September 1915.Increase of Dog 16. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer explained that a com-Tax- mitteeof members of the various Departments concerned was meet-ing that day to consider the question of the Dog Tax. For thepurposes of food control, and if recommended by that Committee,his proposal was to tax dogs on the following scale : The tax on adog owned before the new Act came into force, 10s. per dog per jannum ; for all other dogs after the first, and any dog not ownedbefore the Act came into operation, the tax was to be 1Z. per dogper annum.   A final decision on this subject was not taken.
Excess Profits Tat 17. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his intention was to impose a tax on excess profits of 80 per cent., but that he realised that this would tell on business generally and might insome cases cause great hardship. He had discussed the matter withthe Chairman of the Board of Referees, which considered the casesof special hardship. The Chairman agreed that 80 per cent, wouldbe a very severe handicap, and on his suggestion the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer proposed to make an extra allowance in respect ofnew capital put into a business since the commencement of the war.In regard to shipping business, Mr. Bonar Law stated that hehad intended to put that industry on the same footing as otherindustries. He pointed out that 90 per cent, of British shipping had been requisitioned, and that, while the Blue Book rates hadformerly yielded large profits, these were now very much reducedby the general increase in necessary expenditure of all kinds. his intention had been to impose an 80 per cent. Excess Profits Tax,with a proviso that no repayments of Excess Profits Duty already paid should be made in cases where a company in the future madesmaller profits than the present standard.Mr. Henderson had other views, to the effect that the G-overn-ment should take all profits exceeding 10 per cent., though he had agreed to a compromise suggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer that the Government should take the average earnedduring the period of three years preceding the war, which would represent an average profit of 13 per cent, to the companies.The War Cabinet decided that The latter arrangement should be adopted.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 1, 1917.Note. At a subsequent meeting of the War Cabinet held on the same day, thequestion of shipping profits was reopened, and it was decided that the matter shouldbe left for the decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.O
