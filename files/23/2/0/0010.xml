Briand, which had been prepared as the result of the conclusions the previous day, and stated that, in view of the urgency of inducingM. Briand or some representative of the French Government tocome to London, he had sent the despatch off that morning byProfessor Mantoux, the interpreter to the Anglo-French Conferences,to whom he had given additional verbal instructions andexplanations.In view of the fact that the communication from the FrenchGovernment was despatched before their receipt of Mr. Balfour&apos;telegram of the previous day, the War Cabinet approved this action and decided that Nothing  further   could   be  done   pending  a  reply  fromM.

The Secretary of State for War desired it to be placed on record that he associated himself fully with the stalemSats of theChief of the Imperial General Staff, and that while he did not agreeto the War Cabinet decision embodied in the Calais Agreement,both he himself and the whole Army Council would do their utmostloyally to give effect to it.* As these documents are of the most secret character, and refer to actual plans of operations, they have not been reproduced.t The question of printing- such statements as were made is reserved for furtherconsideration.
9 ^(0 0The Commander-in-chief of theBritish Expedi-tionary Force.9. The War Cabinet observe that the tendency of the Frenchcommunications, both to Field-Marshal Sir Douglas&apos; Haig and tothe British Government since the signature of the Calais Agreement,is to treat the Field-Marshal definitely as a subordinate of General Nivelle rather than as an equal who has temporarily and for a specific operation been placed under the orders of the french commander-in-Chief; They observe in these communications norecognition of the fact that the British Government has itself madea great concession in entering into this Agreement, and that Field-Marshal Sir Dotiglas Haig has been asked by the British Governmentto make considerable sacrifices.The War Cabinet consider it important, in the interests of thegood relations- of the two Oommanders-in-Chief, that any favourable opportunity should be talken for - making it clear to the FrenchGovernment that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig has their full confidence, as mentioned in War Cabinet 82, Minute 13.

APPENDIX I.APRES avoir pris connaissance, le 7 mars, du memorandum redige par le Comitefrangais de Guerre au sujet des differences d&apos;opinion existant entre les Commandantsen Chef des Armies francaise et britannique, le Premier Ministre avait emis 1&apos;avisqu&apos;il convenait de soumettre cette importante affaire a une conference des chefs desdeux Gouvernements.LVAmbassadeur de France avait fait connaitre cette opinion de Mr. Lloyd George ason Gouvernement, qui vient de lui repondre dans le sens suivant :II serait actuellement impossible a M. Briand de quitter Paris en raison desdiscussions en cours au Parlement francais.D&apos;autre part, une seconde conference ne pourrait apporter aucun changementappreciable a une situation qui n&apos;a pas besoin d&apos;etre examinee a nouveau, puisque cettesituation vient d&apos;etre reglee d&apos;une maniere complete a Calais entre les chefs des deuxGouvernements et qu&apos;aucun evenement inattendu n&apos;est venu la modifier.Le Gouvernement francais ne peut qu&apos;en appeler au Gouvernement britanniqueconformement a 1&apos;accord commun.Le Protocole de Calais, signe par le Marechal Haig, a decide :1. Que le Marechal anglais conformerait ses plans d&apos;operations aux plansstrategiques prepares par le General en Chef francais ;2. Que pendant la periode comprise entre la date du Protocole de Calais et celledu commencement des operations, le Marechal Haig conformerait ses preparatifs auxvues du General Niveile (sauf dans le cas oii il considererait que cela mettrait en dangerla securite de son armee ou prejudicierait a son succes, hypothese dans laquelle ilrendrait compte de sa decision et de ses motifs au chef d&apos;etat-major anglais);3. Que, apres la date du commencement des operations et jusqu&apos;a leur fin, leMarechal anglais se conformerait aux ordres du General en Chef frangais sur tous lespoints relatifs a la conduite des operations.Depuis la Conference de Calais, aucun fait nouveau ne s&apos;est produit qui soitsusceptible d&apos;entrainer une modification, soit dans le plan general d&apos;offensive prepare etadopte, soit dans les conditions ou le commandement devait etre exerce.Le memorandum du Marechal Haig est base sur des hypotheses qui pouvaient etredeja formulees a Calais, puisque ie repli des Allemands sur 1&apos;Ancre etait dejacommence a ce moment et que les consequences de ce repli ont ete envisagees danstoute leur ampleur, en y examinant jusqu&apos;au cas ou. les Allemands se replieraient sur la ligne dite de &quot; Hindenburg,&quot; ce qui ne s&apos;est pas meme encore realise. Iln&apos;est donepas admissible que le Marechal Haig en fasse etat pour formuler de simples hypothesesqu&apos;il considere comme de nature a faire obstacle a 1&apos;execution d&apos;un accord delibere enpleine connaissance de cause, arrete et signe a la fois par les chefs des deux Gouverne-ments et les Generaux en Chef des deux armees.II avait ete egalement entendu nettement a Calais qu&apos;un organe de liaison entre les deux commandements serait etabii au quartier general francais ; le Marechal Haigavait accepte de constituer cet organisme, en plein accord avec le General Niveile ; ilne saurait aujourd&apos;hui revenir sur la decision prise et 1&apos;accord etabii a cet egard.De telles incertitudes au moment d&apos;engager des operations aussi graves et a laveille d&apos;une initiative possible de 1&apos;ennemi sont des plus dangereuses : elles pourraientavoir pour consequences de compromettre irreparablement le sort meme de la guerre.En communiquant ces observations au Premier Ministre de Grande-Bretagne,PAmbassadeur de France est charge de lui exprimer 1&apos;entiere confiance du Gouverne-ment de la Republique dans le sens profond des interets communs et dans la volonteprevoyante de Mr. Lloyd George pour faire executer les decisions des deuxGouvernements.Ambassade de France, Londres,le 8 mars, 1917.
APPENDIX II.(G.T.-93.) -Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff regarding the Calais Agreement ofFebruary 27, 1917.1. AS my signature is appended to the Calais Agreement of the 27th ultimoregarding the future relations between Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle, I ask the permission of the War Cabinet to explain that the signature does not mean that I approve of the principle &quot;underlying the Agreement. The Prime minister informed me and Sir Douglas Haig at Calais that the principle is, as decided by theWar Cabinet on the 24th ultimo, that General Nivelle should be in command of theFrench and British Armies during the battle in question, and that Sir Douglas Haigshould carry out the orders of General Nivelle in the same way as they would becarried out by a Commander of a group of French Armies.2. It is obvious that I am not in a position either to approve or disapprove of theprinciple the War Cabinet decided to adopt, because I am not a Member of the WarCabinet ; my advice was not asked when the question was discussed by the WarCabinet, nor had I any opportunity of giving it, as I was not present at the meeting;having previously been told by the Secretariat of the War Cabinet not to attend unless had anything special to bring forward. The first intimation I had that any suchchange in principle was contemplated either by the British or the French Governmentwas when I received General nivelle&apos;s proposals at 9 p.m. on the first day of theConference. (As the War Cabinet know, these proposals were not accepted by thePrime Minister. Other proposals were drafted under his direction by Sir M. Hankey,and these, with certain additions made by myself and General Nivelle, eventuallyformed the Agreement signed.)3. My opinion, as I informed the Prime Minister at the time, is that unity of effort in such a vast battle could be adequately ensured without absolute unity of command (Waterloo is an example on a small scale), and was in fact appropriatelyensured by the instructions given by the Secretary of State for War to Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig when he assumed command of the British Armies in France, and that sir Douglas Haig might be completely trusted to support and co-operate with General Nivelle to the utmost extent of his power. Further, I pointed out that the WarCabinet had already very strongly emphasised the necessity for Sir Douglas Haigsupporting General Nivelle in every possible way by their decision of the 17th Januarylast, and that this decision had been communicated to the French Government. I also stated that it was difficult to see any practical alternative between allowingpresent arrangements to stand and permanently placing the British Armies completelyunder General Nivelle&apos;s command.4. It seemed to me that the principle adopted was a dangerous one, because itmight prove to be the thin end of the wedge which the French have for long desiredto obtain for bringing the British Armies in France under definite French control, andI suggested to the Prime Minister that it would be difficult to justify departing fromthe principle once it is established, because if the arrangement made is the best for onebattle it can be argued that it will be best for all. I also stated that our officersand men could not be expected to fight nearly as well under a foreign commander;that the Dominion Governments might object ; and that entirely to entrust thefortunes of this great battle to a foreign Commander, who as yet has had no opportunityof proving his fitness for the position, was a serious step, viewed from the standpointof the Empire. I also mentioned the legal aspect of the case, which is that no british officer can be placed under the orders of any officer not holding His Majesty&apos;commission. This, however, may be met by the phrase &quot; conform to the orders.&quot; I donot know whether this is so or not.5. The Prime Minister was unable to accept my views, and deemed it necessary,in pursuance of the War Cabinet decision of 24th February, 1917, to lay down theprovisions contained in the Agreement, one of which is that Sir Douglas Haig should&quot;conform to the orders&quot; of General Nivelle during the battle, subject to the provisorecommended by me and given at the end of paragraph 2 (4) of the Agreement.6. I trust that I have now made it clear that T did not, and in fact could not, agreewith the principle of placing the British Armies under General Nivelle, and therefore that my signature merely means that the procedure laid down in the Agreementappears to me to be the one best suited to give effect to the principle which the WarCabinet had already decided to adopt.
7. I ought to add, with reference to Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s views, that he informed me at Calais that he clearly understood the instructions of the War Cabinet regardingthe forthcoming operations as previously communicated to him ; that he would do his best to meet those instructions ; and that he did not think it was for him to take partin any discussion as to any further arrangements the War Cabinet wished to make withthe French ; but that if they decided to give him other instructions as to his relations Owith General Nivelle he would, of course, endeavour to carry them out to the best ofhis power. He also gave me the following note in regard to the proposals put forward by General Nivelle, which, as the Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet on the28th ultimo, would have meant the abolition of the British Commander-in-Chief, andtherefore he refused to accept them : &quot; C.I.G.S., February 27. I have in the short time available considered thedecision of the War Cabinet (of which Mr. Lloyd George informed us last night)to place the British Army in France under the orders of the French Commander-in-Chief, and the proposals of the French to give effect to that decision.&quot; In my opinion, there are only two alternatives, viz. : &quot;1. To leave matters as they are now; or&quot; 2. To  place  the  British  Army in France entirely under the french commander-in-Chief.&quot; The decision to adopt the second of these proposals must involve the disappearance of the British Commander-in-Chief and General Headquarters.What further changes would be necessary must depend on the French Com-mander-in-Chief and the French Government under whom he acts.&quot; So drastic a change in our system at a moment when active operations on alarge scale have already commenced seem to me to be fraught with the gravestdanger.&quot;(Initialled) W. R. R.March 2, 1917.
