Western Front.The german withdrawal.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained on a mapthe latest information on the subject of the German withdrawal onthe Western Front, indicating that the Allies, in their pursuit, havealready passed beyond some of the positions which had beenprepared by the enemy for a step-by-step defence in theirretirement.Possible Attack by sea in Rear ofAllied Lines.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadconferred with the First Sea Lord regarding the possibility of anenemy attack l$y sea in rear of the Allied line in the region ofNieuport, with the result that the First Sea Lord had expressed theview that in the present situation it was a feasible operation of war(see War Cabinet 22, Minute 7). The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff stated that consequently he had communicated with Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on the subject, and read the relevanttelegrams. Sir Douglas Haig stated in his communication thatthere were at present no indications of any preparations on thepart of the enemy to undertake such an operation, but pointed outthat our coastal defences were not designed to deal with anything more than small raids. Sir&apos; Douglas Haig further indicated thenature of the measures which he would adopt to cope with such an operation, and asked for further information as to Naval co-operation.The First Sea Lord explained that the enemy could assemblesufficient tugs and lighters through the canals at Zeebrugge andOstend, and use them for the conveyance of a landing party of some20,000 to 30,000 troops, which would make the passage by nightclose inshore, and that the disembarkation could be effected atdawn under the protection of some of the heavy artillery maintained by the enemy along the Belgian coast.The War Cabinet instructed The First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial General staff to examine the question further and report, after consulta-tion, if necessary, with Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.The RecruitingPosition :The amendments to the MilitaryService Acts.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, before leaving for italy, reported upon the bad outlook in regard to drafts, and urged the importance of pressing forward the amendments to the MilitaryService Acts and other measures referred by the War Cabinet toLord Rhondda&apos;s Committee (War Cabinet 64, Minute 8).The Secretary reported that, according to his information,Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee was on the point of reporting.Submarines.4. The First Sea Lord stated that, in his opinion, the successesagainst enemy submaiines could&apos; not be assumed to exceed twelvecertainties (including two interned) and ten probables sincethe 1st January, 1917. He gave the usual statement of mercantilelosses from enemy submarines.Naval Casualties. 5. The First Sea Lord reported that the sloops &quot; Mignonette &quot;and &quot; Alyssum &quot; had struck mines and had sunk. He also reported the loss of the paddle-minesweeper &quot; Duchess of Montrose&quot; offDunkirk, and the sinking of the destroyer &quot; Paragon.&quot;Destruction of anEnemy Raider.6. The First Sea Lord read a description of the sinking of theGerman raider &quot; Rena&quot;. by H.M.S. &quot; Achilles &quot; and the armedboarding steamer &quot; Dundee.&quot;   No one was picked up owing to the
sighting of a submarine. The raider fought under the Norwegianflag. The First Sea Lord inclined to the view that the raider washomeward bound, and stated that the Admiralty had decided not to publish a statement on the subject for the present.7. With reference to War Cabinet, 97, Minute 11, the first sea Lord reported that information had been received fromthe Naval Commander-in-Chief, China Station, that the capturedGerman merchant-ships had all been damaged, but not seriously,owing to the promptitude with which action had been taken.Italy. 8. The War Cabinet took note of the Memorandum by theChief of the Imperial General Staff, dated the 17th March, 1917,on the subject of the desDatch of reinforcements from the Westernto the Italian Front (General Staff Paper, 01/89/259).Russia.The Military&apos;Command.9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff communicated thefollowing message from the Grand Duke Nicholas, indicating that,notwithstanding information to the contrary, it might be assumed that the Grand Duke has become Commander-in-Chief of theRussian armies : &quot;I send you and Chiefs of the Allied Military Missionsmy very sincere gratitude for your telegram, and I feel sureyou will help me in organising and maintaining that combinedaccord of efforts of the Allies which is so indispensable for ourjoint success and final victory. Nicholas.&quot;ProposedResolution to theDuma.10. The Prime Minister reported that, in view of the attitudeof the House of Commons, the Government had felt obliged to announce their attention of moving a resolution in Parliament onThursday next, expressing hope and confidence in the Duma, butpointing out that we are not free from danger. The War cabinet agreed that In the existing obscure situation in Russia, the precise terms ofthe resolution should be finally drafted on the day onwhich it was to be moved.Revolution. jj. The War Cabinet approved the action of the Secretary of    -State for Foreign Affairs in his private telegram, dated the17th March, 1917, to the British Ambassador in Petrograd,expressing confidence in his courage and discretion, and authori-sing him to take independent action if circumstances necessitatedsuch a course.Further Telegrams 12. With reference to War Cabinet, 98, Minute 2, the war to Labour Leaders. Cabinet did not approve M. Miliukoffs proposal, forwarded by theBritish Ambassador at Petrograd in his telegram No. 342 of the3 7th March, 1917, that a further telegram should be sent by theBritish Labour Leaders, having regard to the fact that germany would exploit the situation if work was not resumed and if disordercontinued. It was felt that the usef ainess of such messages wouldbe limited by too frequent repetition. .......China:Seizure of german shipping.
The Agenda of the 13. The War Cabinet had under consideration the Provisionalimperial War Agenda prepared for the Imperial War Cabinets by Lord Milner&apos;sCabmets. Committee (War Cabinet, 95, Minute 1 (h)).   There was some dis-cussion as to whether there was not a danger lest the despatchof business might be delayed if the Agenda was strictly adhered to,and it was decided that -If time permits, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should both make their statements atthe first Meeting, i.e., on the 20th March, 1917,Publication of 14. With reference to War Cabinet, 97, Minute 15, the FirstTonnage of Lord of the Admiralty stated that the Board was opposed to theShipping Losses. prompt publication of the tonnage of shipping losses, for the addi-tional reason that such publication might be of assistance to theenemy as to the routes followed by our merchant vessels. He statedthat the Germans already published their version of our losses and included all vessels damaged, although they might get safely intoharbour, and that if we delayed our reports for a matter of two orthree months we should be able to discredit the German statements,and at the same time fail to convey any useful information to theenemy.   The War Cabinet Approved the proposal of the First Lord of the Admiralty.The NavalShipbuildingProgramme:Torpedo-boatDestroyers.15. With reference to War Cabinet, 58, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them the Report (Appendix I) of the Committeeformed under War Cabinet, 95, Minute 1 (a), and approved theadditional Naval Shipbuilding Programme recommended therein.Increase ofPortugueseContingent.16. With regard to the instructions in War Cabinet, 95,Minute 1 (c), the War Cabinet considered the Report (Appendix II.)of the Committee od the Proposed Increase in the PortugueseContingent now being transported to France, and decided that The matter shotild be further considered by the War Cabineton the return from France of the Secretary of State forWar.Eecord ofGovernmentImports.17. With reference to War Cabinet, 81, Minute 7, the WarCabinet considered the Report (Paper G.T.-144, Appendix III) ofSir IT. Babington Smith relative to a record being kept of allimports on Government account, and approved his proposals contained therein.The War Cabinet desire that all Departments concerned willtake the necessary action to enable the Board of Customsto compile complete returns.Food.Potatoes forScotland and theArmy.18. The War Cabinet further considered their decision of the15th March, 1917 (War Cabinet, 97, Minutes 19 and 20), in the lightof a letter received from the Secretary of State for War, dated the17th March, 1917 (Paper G.T.-195, Appendix IV).The Secretary for Scotland stated that he had taken immediate steps to carry out the policy decided upon on the 15th March. Hehad made the necessary arrangements with the Treasury and had communicated with the chief towns in Scotland where there was apotato famine (Appendix V).The Quarter-Master-General pointed out that the allowance of
6 oz. per soldier per day would require 24,000 tons of potatoes, andthere were only 25,000 tons in sight. If 10,000 tons were taken for Scotland from this quantity, the soldier&apos;s ration would be seriously reduced. It was urged, in reply, that the army at homemight fairly be asked to share the shortage with the civilian population, and that the War Office calculation was based on there being no fresh supplies of potatoes till June, whereas Jerseypotatoes should be coming forward towards the middle of May andwould enable the ration to be increased.The War Cabinet confirmed their decision of the 15th March.It was understood that the War Office would not requisitionfrom civilian supplies at home to make up for the 10,000tons, but would be free to draw what supplies they couldfrom foreign sources.19. The War Cabinet resumed the discussion on Food Suppliesadjourned from the 15th March, 1917 (War Cabinet, 97, Minutes17-21).The Chief Secretary for Ireland reported the recommendationsof a Conference of the Departments concerned which had metearlier in the day. The Conference had before them the following documents : (1.) Summarv of Provisions of Proposed Meals Order. Reportby Lord Devonport (G.T.-175).(2.) The Need of a Policv for Dealing with Live-stock. Reportby Mr. A. D. Hall&apos;(G.T.-180).(3.) Meat Supplies. Report by the President of the Board ofTrade (G.T. 179).(4.) Memorandum by Professor Adams (G.T.-155).(5.) Memorandum by  the  Chief  Secretary  for  Ireland rePotatoes (G.T.-154).(6.) Report by Ministry of Food as to Prices (G.T.-205).(7.) Note on Milk Prices by the Food Controller (G.T.-204).(8.) Memorandum  by Sir   R, H.   Rew   on   Meat   Supplies(G.T.-207).The chief problem considered by the Conference was a proposal of the War Office to requisition about one-fifth (i.e., 10,000 tons) ofthe monthly supply of imported refrigerated meat from the RiverPlate out of the amount now allotted from that source for civilian consumption in the United Kingdom. This proposal arose from thedesire of the War Office to have an adequate meat reserve for theArmy, in view of the submarine campaign. The proposal was-objected to mainly on the grounds that- (a.) The monthly civilian supply of 8,000 to 10,000 tons, con-trolled by the Board of Trade, was a most powerfulfactor in restraining the upward tendency of the prices,of the home meat supply ;(&amp;.) The withdrawal of this quantity by the Army would destroy the retail distributing organisation of the contractors,who might then terminate the present favourablecontract between the River Plate Meat companies andthe Government, and raise the prices to the Govern-ment of all imported meat ;(c.) Any action by the Government at this moment tending toraise meat prices would re-act most unfavourably on the milk supply later on. The Board of Agriculture would much prefer that the War Office should not requisitionhome-grown meat until late in the summer.
Proposed MealsOrder and aMeatless Day.Issue of FoodNotices.Food Production.The recommendations of the Conference were approved by theWar Cabinet in the following form : (1.) That the Chief Secretary for Ireland should confer with theShipping Controller with a view to the provision, if    , *possible, of additional tonnage temporarily in the next   J /three months for bringing refrigerated meat from theRiver Plate for the Army ;(2.) That General Atkins is satisfied if he is able to call on, atthe first of each month, 15,000 tons of beef and muttonfrom cold stores if emergency requires.(3.) That Mr. Prothero, the Food Controller, General Atkins,and Sir Thomas Robinson should consider what action can be taken with regard to providing a supply of home-killed beef from July onwards for Army purposes, andthat the Committee should consult with the Scotch and irish Departments.(4.) That the setting up of a meatless day in the home is atpresent undesirable.(5.) That it is desirable to issue a notice to reassure the farmeras to receiving a remunerative price for milk, and that acommittee, representative of the three Departments ofAgriculture and the Food Controller, to report on theproduction and distribution of milk supplies, beappointed.(6.) That an appeal be made to well-to-do consumers to abstain from the consimiption of potatoes.20. The War Cabinet decided in favour of the observance of onemeatless day per week, viz., Wednesday, in every public eating-place, and approved generally the other provisions of the ProposedMeals Order submitted by &quot;the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-J 75,Appendix VI).21. The War Cabinet decided that the proposed press noticesdealing with the regulation of milk prices should be issued abovethe joint signatures of the Boards of Agriculture and the Ministryof Food.22. The War Cabinet emphasised the importance of obtainingaccurate weekly returns from the War Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees showing the progress made with measures for theincrease of food production. The representatives of the Board ofAgriculture urged that it would greatly assist the farmers if theywere definitely told the number of additional acres which theGovernment wished put under tillage in 1918.The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheriesundertook to consider and report what cultivation wouldbe required to make the country, as far as possible, self-supporting, and what were the prospects of realising sucha policy from the standpoint of labour, machinery, and fertilisers.(Initialled)D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,March 20, 1917.
APPENDIX I.Report of the Committee on the Proposed Naval Shipbuilding Programme to 1918.Present:The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P. (in the Chair).Admiral Sir J. R, Jellicoe, G.C.B., O.M., G.C.V.O., First Sea Lord of the.Admiralty.Mr. W. S. Abell, Ministry of Shipping.THE Committee, having considered the letter of the Secretary of the Admiralty,dated the 5th March, 1917, forwarding the proposals of the Board of Admiralty as toan increased building programme of Torpedo-boat Destroyers, &amp;c. (G.T.-105), recom-mend the covering approval of the War Cabinet to the building, before the end of1918, of the following vessels, in addition to those already authorised by WarCabinet, 58, Minute 1 :-6 Flotilla Leaders.43 Torpedo-boat Destroyers.6 &quot; Q &quot; Patrol Boats.G.T.-210. APPENDIX II.Report of the Committee on the Proposed Increase in the Portuguese Contingent nowbeing Transported to France.Present:The Right Hon. the Earl Derby, I\.G., G.C.V.O., C.B. (in the Chair).Admiral Sir J. R. Jellicoe, G.C.B., O.M.,G.C.V.O., First Sea Lord of theAdmiralty.Mr. E. J. Foley, Ministry of Shipping.Major-General Sir R. D. Whigham, K.C.B.,D.S.O., Deputy Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.THE Committee, having considered the Admiralty Report, dated the 6th March,1917 (G.T.-113), relative to the proposed increase in the Portuguese Contingent to be transported to France, recommend that the Portuguese Government should beinformed that serious shortage of shipping and the urgent necessity of making thefullest possible use of every available destroyer in combating the submarine menace,cause His Majesty&apos;s Government to regret that, under existing conditions, they areunable to make any arrangement for the transport of the additional troops entailed bythe proposed increase, but trust to be able to put forward proposals at a later date.The Committee further recommend that the War Office be authorised to approach the Portuguese Government with a view to railway construction and labour battalions,as they become available, taking priority over the Portuguese troops already under orders for the Western Front, but still awaiting transport.
APPENDIX III.G.T.-144.Record of Imports on Government Account.(Memorandum by Sir TI, Babington Smith.)1. THE records of Imports which are published in the Monthly and Annual TradeReturns are compiled by the Board of Customs from particulars of quantity and value which the importer is required to furnish before clearance within fourteen days afterthe arrival of the ship.2. Imports which at the time of importation are the property of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment or of the Governments of the Allies are not included in these returns, andthe only records of them are such as are kept by the Departments concerned for theirown purposes. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Imports of food forGovernment account (meat, wheat, sugar) are included in the Customs Returns, and inother cases Government imports may be included because the ownership is not knownto&apos;be other than private. The result is that it is difficult to say whether any particularhead of imports includes any Government imports or not, or to know what portion ofthe total represents Government imports.The principal importing Departments are : War Office.Ministry of Munitions.Admiralty.Office of Works (timber, now transferred to War Office).Air Board.Board of Trade (meat).Sugar Commission.Wheat Commission.The records of the imports made by these and other Departments are not at presentcompiled or brought together in any way. We consider it important that there shouldbe a record of these imports in such a form that complete information may be available as to the whole of the imports into the United Kingdom.3. This record should be compiled by the Board of Customs in the same manner as the General Trade Returns. For this purpose it would only be necessary that each department should within a specified period furnish-to the Customs particulars ofquantity and, if practicable, of value for each consignment received. It would not benecessary for the ship to carry documents showing particulars of Government cargo.The Board of Customs should arrange with the Departments concerned themanner in which the particulars should be furnished and the precautions necessary for avoiding duplication.4. We do not think that this work could be conveniently undertaken by theTonnage Priority Committee. That Committee deals with goods which it is proposedto ship. The returns should deal with goods which have actually arrived. TheCommittee has no staff or machinery in existence for the work. The CustomsStaff which deals with the General Trade Returns, could, with very small additions,deal with this work also. Suitable machinery exists for deciding questions ofclassification. We believe that the Returns would be of the greatest use to theTonnage Priority Committee.5. The question of the inclusion of certain kinds of Government imports in theGeneral Trade Returns should be considered afresh by the Board of Trade and theBoard of Customs, and definite rules should be adopted. The object should be toinclude all articles imported by the Government in the General Trade Returns, unless there are special reasons for their exclusion. A list of articles to be excluded shouldbe prepared by the Departments specially concerned.We think it desirable that no articles should be excluded from the general Returnsexcept where secrecy is of real importance and can only be obtained in this way.Secrecy may, for instance, often be secured by the inclusion of items under some general headings as well as by exclusion. Thus explosives might be described as&quot; general chemicals.&quot;The figures relating to the articles thus excluded would not be published, but
would be compiled separately by the Customs and would be available for government. A. similar question arises as regards Government exports, and we recommendthat a similar procedure should be followed. Exports to France, or other theatres ofwar for the use of British forces of all kinds, need not be included in the Returns;but exports for foreign Governments and for Governments of Dominions or colonies should be included.7. If the above recommendations are approved, it will be necessary that instructions should be given to all Departments to furnish the necessary particulars tothe Board of Customs.(Signed) H. BABINGTON SMITH.APPENDIX IV.G.T-195. --Potatoes for the Army.Letter from Secretary of State for War to Secretary of War Cabinet.My dear Sir Maurice, March 17, 1917.I SPOKE to the Prime Minister yesterday with reference to the decision of theWar Cabinet on the subject of potatoes to be deducted for civil consumption fromthose which have been bought and requisitioned for the troops by the Army CanteenCommittee, and have asked for reconsideration of the question.I would point out that not only was I not present when this particular item was discussed, but I was distinctly told that it would not come on, and, indeed, the PrimeMinister told me himself that he had no idea that it was coming on.The result was that Colonel Gordon Leith was the only member present o speak on behalf of the War Office, and although he put his case, I believe, very clearly, itwas obvious that he was not in a position to attempt to enforce his views in the way that I, or more senior members of the War Office, would do. In consequence, I do notthink that the War Cabinet fully appreciated the position.The soldier is rationed by a ration in kind, together with a ration in cash,amounting to 5^d. per man per day. The ration in kind consists of meat, bread,bacon, tea, &amp;c, and the whole of the balance of the man&apos;s daily ration has to be bought out of this 5^d. through the canteen. It is therefore the duty of the ArmyCanteen Committee to supply suitable articles of foodstuff upon which this sum of 5^d.per day per man can be spent.At the request of the Food Controller, a large number of standard articles of diet,such as extra ham and bacon, bread, rabbits, sugar, &amp;c, have been already eliminatedfrom the list of articles on which this 5^d. can be spent.When the War Cabinet, therefore, ordered the soldier to have one potatolessday a week and less potatoes on the other six, they were again seriously curtailing thestandard articles upon which this o^d. is generally and properly spent, and that I am.sure they would not wish to do.The Army Canteen Committee, with great foresight, bought-when necessaryusing their requisitioning powers sufficient potatoes to supply the men with acurtailed allowance till the next potato crop is lifted, but even then they are some-what short of the amount that would be required, having in view only 29,000 tonsinstead of 36,000 tons that would be required to give the present full ration. Thiscomparatively small deficiency would have been met by the issue of other vegetables ;but now we are called upon to release 10,000 out of the 29,000 tons for the benefit ofScotland. If this order is carried out it means only 19,000 tons left to the Army,whereas 36,000 tons are required. This reduction will involve, when allowance ismade for losses owing to the recent frost, a maximum amount to the troops of   lb. perman per day, which will practically involve every alternate day being a potatolessday for the Army, which goes far beyond the allowance proposed by the War Cabinet,as any increase on the fib. per man per day would involve further purchases orrequisitions by the Army Canteen Committee.We are informed by the Treasury Solicitor, who is the person to whom we have torefer for legal advice, that it is not legal for us to use an Army requisition to supply
the civil population, and the War Cabinet&apos;s decision, if it stands, calls upon me to doat the same time an illegal act and a great injustice to the soldier. i;I am afraid the point that was urged that Scotland had denuded itself of potatoesin order to find seed potatoes cannot, from an Army point of view, be looked upon asa very happy argument for giving up the 10,000 tons, as I may point out that we had made arrangements to plough up as much Army and other land* as we possibly could in order to grow potatoes this summer, having received an assurance from the Boardof Agriculture confirmed in writing that they would provide us as far as possible with the necessary seed. We therefore made no effort to purchase such seed, relying on the Board of Agriculture to fulfil their promise. We are now informed by that department that of the 1,500 tons of seed potatoes which we were promised andurgently require, they can only supply us with 100 tons.I have reason to believe that the statement made by Colonel Gordon Leith at theMeeting, that the amount of potatoes controlled by the Army Canteen Committee isonly a small percentage of the amounts still available, is correct.I hope the matter can be reconsidered next week when, if owing to absence inParis I am unable myself to be present, the Quartermaster-General can attend and state his views. Till then I propose not to put into execution the War Cabinet&apos;decision, which I respectfully say I think was arrived at without the full facts.of thethe case being properly understood. 1Yours sincerely,(Signed) DERBY.APPENDIX V.Potatoes for Scotland.IT cannot be too strongly urged that the main reason for pressing this matter isthat there is practically potato famine in Scotland already, because (1) the 1916 cropin that country has failed in a degree beyond comparison greater than in England orIreland; and (2) over, and above the bad harvest, the necessary action of the FoodController in regard to seed potatoes has practically turned all Scottish potatoes intoseed potatoes, to the great benefit of England, but the further prejudice of Scotland.The case is, therefore, quite special to Scotland.In reply to a request for information up to date, the following telegrams were received on Saturday and yesterday from the four largest Scottish towns : &quot; Glasgow.&quot;Local situation is practically no potatoes for home consumption, all Scotchsupplies being reserved for seed purposes. Our city&apos;s average normal require-ments are 2,000 tons per Aveek. The actual supplies available are confined to afew waggons from England each day, or alternate days.&quot;&quot; Edinburgh.&quot; President, Local Association, informs me that average normal potatorequirements are 600 tons weekly.   Present available supplies about 20 tons.&quot;&quot;&apos;&apos; Aberdeen.&quot;Supply has practically been exhausted for last ten days. Average normal requirements between 300 and 400 tons per week. Actual supplies available donot exceed a few tons.&quot;&quot; Dundee.&quot; About 200 tons per week approximate normal requirements. Impossiblegive available supplies without returns from farmers and dealers in district.&quot;The following telegram was received this morning from the Scottish Co-operative wholesale Society, Glasgow :-   .&quot; Potato position in Scotland worse than ever. We are afraid there is goingto be a serious shortage of seed also.&quot;
APPENDIX VI.G.T.-175.--Summary of Provisions of Proposed Meals Order.(Circulated at the request of Lord Devonport.)EXCEPT under the authority of the Food Controller, the following regulations as to foodstuffs shall be observed in every inn, hotel, restaurant, refreshment house,club, boarding-house, or other place of public eating (hereinafter referred to as apublic eating place): 1.

Our remainingScotch crop is practically all reserved for seed, the hulk of which is going toEngland. There is nothing coining from Ireland, and from&apos; England we get onlya few waggons at intervals.&quot;It is in view of the above facts that the suggestion has been made that the HomeArmy should, to some extent, share the shortage of the civil population.Scottish Office, March 19, 1917.
