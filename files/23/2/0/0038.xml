The Right Hon. A. Henderson, M.P.Kedleston, KG., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.The Right Hon. the Viscount Milner,G.C.B., G.C.M.G.The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P.The following were also present :-The Right Hon. C. Addison, M.D., M.P.,Minister of Munitions.The Right Hon. H. E. Duke, K.C., M.P.,Chief Secretary for Ireland.The Right Hon. W. Long, M.P., Secretaryof State for the Colonies.The Right Hon. Sir E. Carson, K.U.,M.P., First Lord of the Admiralty.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M. P. A. Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary.The Life ofParliament:The Influence ofthe Irish Question.1. THE War Cabinet discussed the attitude to be taken up bythe Government in the House of Commons if, as was anticipated,the Irish Nationalist Party adopted an obstructive attitude towardsthe passage of the Bill for prolonging the life of the present parliament.   Two alternatives were discussed, namely: 1. An immediate dissolution, to be followed by a GeneralElection ;2. A firm attitude towards the Irish Party.It was generally agreed that the former course was open tothe strongest objections. The country as a whole would not understand the reasons for dissolution, and would probably beannoyed ; and it was believed that the Parliamentary opposition would not oppose the Bill prolonging the life of Parliament, inwhich case it would be very unseemly to dissolve and fight aGeneral Election against the present Opposition. Moreover, nodifficulty was anticipated in passing the Bill by means of the closure within a few days.On the other hand, it was recognised that the second alternativemight lead to a policy of continual obstructiveness on the part ofthe Irish Party during the remainder of the Parliamentary Session. &apos;This would lead to a difficult Parliamentary situation, and on somequestions the Irish party might be able to focus opposition fromother quarters of the House of Commons and eventually force a dissolution.
The War Cabinet decided that The Government should endeavour to carry the Bill forprolonging the life of Parliament, and proceed, pursuant to receut declarations in Parliament, to formulate its policy for the settlement of the Irish question.Ireland: 2. The War Cabinet then proceeded to discuss at some lengthyThe policy of the      the various proposals that have been made for the settlement of theGovernment. Irisb question.It was pointed out that the present position is governed by thefollowing factors : (1.) The Home Rule Act is, in certain respects, out of date,and, in any circumstances and by common consent,must be amended before it can come into operation.(2.) The Government have announced in Parliament their intention of endeavouring to find a settlement.(3.) The Irish Nationalist Party decline to enter into any negotiations for a settlement.(4.) The permanent partition of Ireland has no friends, hut, onthe other hand, any attempt to include Ulster in ascheme of Home Rule at the present time must end infailure.One proposal which had been recently examined was that theHome Rule Act should come into operation, but that the six counties of Ulster should remain excluded until after the war (onthe ground that, in the absence of many electors with the Colours,no representative Poll of the electors could be taken), and that,alter the war. a Poll by Counties should he taken on the basis that a County should remain outside the operation of the HomeRulp Act,, unless a 55 per cent, majority, i.e,, a majority in theproportion of 55 to 45 of the electors voting, voted for inclusion inthe County. Inquiries, however, showed that neither Party would accept this. Ulster regarded the risk as too great, and the nationalists regarded it as an expedient to exclude Tyrone andFermanagh.Various suggestions for a Conference or Commission on any ofthe recognised lines were rejected. It was generally agreed that aConference or a Statutory or Royal Commission to advise theGovernment on the question would not be acceptable to any of theparties to the controversy. The Nationalists would regard it merely as an expedient to shelve the question of Home Rule, and theUistermen would suspect it as an insiduous attempt to overrulethem on important questions of principle. In the general atmo-sphere of suspicion which surrounded this question, it would offer no prospect of a solution. It wras also agreed that neither Houseof Parliament would he prepared to cede its power of influencingthis question by setting up a Legislative Commission whose decisions would carry statutory authority. Mr. Asquith, in proposing aCommission, when questioned on the point, stated that this was nothis intention.Variants of this proposal, such as making subject to Parlia-mentary sanction the Orders in Council carrying out the decisionsof a Legislative Commission, were also rejected.After a lengthy discussion, the War Cabinet decided uponthe following scheme : (a.) A Bill to amend the Home Rule Act, based on the headsof policy outlined below, should be introduced into parliament as an earnest of the Governments desire toreach a fair settlement, but not to be forced through ifopposed by the Irish Members.ex,
(b.) Between the Second Beading and the Committee stages ofthe Bill, both the Home Rule Act and the Bill itself should he referred to a Conference, which would con-sider the amendments to he made in both. this conference should be of an informal character, some-what on the lines of the recent Speakers Conference onthe question of Parliamentary Suffrage, and should haveO the right of hearing the views of  all parties.    Incomposition, it should not necessarily be confined to members of either or both Houses of Parliament. TheGovernment should introduce the Conference^ Recom-mendations at the Committee stage of the Bill.A proposal was also discussed that the Government should announce its intention of enforcing the Home Rule Act by a certain date if an agreed Bill on these lines was not accepted by a certainearlier date, the idea underlying this proposal being that all partiesto the controversy would be stimulated to agreement by their mutual dislike of the Home Rule Act.No decision on this point was taken.As a step towards the investigation of this scheme, the &quot;WarCabinet decided that The preparation of  a Draft Bill should be referred to aCommittee composed of the following: Lord Curzon,The Chief Secretary for Ireland,The Minister of Munitions,who should include the following heads of policy in their draft: The four Protestant Counties of Ulster, with Tyroneand Fermanagh, to have the option of voting outof the Home Rule Act on the basis that theyshould not be included except upon the vote of amajority in the proportion of 55 to 45, i.e., a55 per cent, majority of the electors voting.*Provision to be made under the amended home rule Act for the periodic assembly of UlsterMembers and an equal delegation of repre-sentatives from the Home Rule Parliament,for the consideration of matters affecting bothareas, these conferences to be convened by theLord Lieutenant, and to have the power toconsider Private Bill proposals affecting local interests in both areas, and proposals for publicenactments affecting the whole of Ireland, uponthe footing that agreed Private Bill legislation might be carried into effect by agreement of the delegations, and that public enactments uponwhich there should be agreement by a majorityof the delegations voting separately might bebrought into operation in the excluded area byOrder in Council concurrently with its cominginto operation in the Home Rule area under theAct of the Home Rule Parliament.Inducements to be included in the form of oppor-tunities for the excluded Counties to have thepowers of voting themselves into the Home RuleAct, and possibly in the shape of financialconcessions to Ireland.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 17, 1917.* Sir Edward Carson stated that it must not be assumed that he would consent to the proposal that these six counties should have the option of voting out of theHome Rule Act on the basis that they should not be included except upon a vote of themajority in the proportion of 55 to 45.o
