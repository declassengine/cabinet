Western Eront:The german withdrawal.1. THE Director of Military Operations reported a slowing downin the advance of the British troops, who had now approximatelyreached the Hindenburg line. Southwards, however, where theHindenburg line was further in i*ear of the original German defensiveline, the French continued to make progress. He stated that theGermans might possibly withdraw their front to the northward ofArras, but there were no immediate indications that this was goingto happen. He read a letter from General Headquarters, France,dated 23rd March, describing the situation on the Western Front.Mesopotamia. 2. The Director of Military Operations reported that general sir Stanley Maude had reinforced his Diala column, and had senthis cavalry to join it. With a viewr to combined action, he wasendeavouring, by aeroplane and other means, to get into touch withthe Russians from Kermanshah, but had not so far, been successful.There were indications that the Turks had, withdrawn a division from Salonica, and that its destination was&quot; probably the Mosuldistrict.Telegram No. 251, of the 24th March, from the British Ministerat Berne, relative to the withdrawal of further Turkish divisions on the Bulgarian front, was read, the Secretary of State for War statingthat similar reports had been received by the War Office.Russia.The military command.3. In reference to War Cabinet, 99, Minute 9, the Director ofMilitary Operations reported that our Military Attache in Petrogradhad reported that General Russky had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Russian armies, and that the Grand Duke Nicholashad placed Ids resignation in the hands of the Government.Possibility of aGerman Concentra-tion on the RigaEront.4s. Replying to a question from the Prime Minister as to theveracity or otherwise of the reports emanating from Russia relative to a German concentration on the Riga front, the Director ofMilitary Operations stated that there was no evidence of this, that itwas the worst season of the year for such an operation, and that he did not think the rumours were correct. He expressed the opinionthat they were being circulated by the Russian Provisional Govern-ment with a view to strengthening the moral of the Russian troops&quot;during the existing crisis.Telegrams relative to Russia, Nos. 397 and 393 of the 25thMarch, from the British Ambassador were read by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.Deputation ofLabour members to. Russia.Arabia:The HedjazRailway.5. Mr. Henderson stated that he had received a communication to the effect that representatives of the French Socialist party, whostood for war a outrance, were, with the authority and consent ofthe French Committee of Foreign Affairs, shortly arriving inEngland en route to Petrograd, where they were going on a mission to the Russian Socialist party, their object being to persuade that party to do all in its power to bring the war to a satisfactory conclusion.  &apos; .The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Henderson should use his influence to secure that asuitably composed British Labour Deputation should accompany the French party with the same object.6. The Director of Military Operations reported furtherdestruction by the Arabs of the Hedjaz Railway and that ouraeroplane flight had been moved from Rabegh to Wej.
Air Raid.The Baltic Fleet.The Sinking of the destroyer&quot; Laforey.&quot;Mine-sweeping.Bombardment of dunkirk.Enemy NavalConcentration atZeebrug^e.Possible Attack by sea in Rear ofAllied Lines.Increase ofPortugueseContingent.7. The First Sea Lord reported the execution of an air raidupon the Berbecke blast furnaces on the 23rd March, and that all our machines had returned safely.8. The First Sea Lord reported that the Russian men-of-war atReval were in the hands of Committees of Seamen, and thatarrangements had been made, with the permission of the RussianMinister of Marine, for the taking over of the submarine depdtship at Reval.9. The First Sea Lord reported the sinking of the destroyer&quot; Laforey,&quot; as the result of striking a mine.The War Cabinet discussed with the First Sea Lord the general question of mine-sweeping and the provision of mine-sweepers, inview of the enemy&apos;s great activity in mine-laying in the vicinity ofthe South Coast of Ireland and the English Channel.10. The First Sea Lord reported a slight and ineffectivebombardment of Dunkirk on the night of the 25th March.11. The War Cabinet took note that the enemy hadconcentrated some thirty destroyers at Zeebrugge. The First sea lord pointed out that such a concentration must be for the purposeof covering a landing on the Belgian coast, or raids in the Channel,or to attack the Dutch convoys and their escorts. He stated thatwe had not at present in those waters sufficient forces to countersuch a threat decisively, and reported the dispositions he had madeto strengthen our forces in these waters.12. The Director of Military Operations, in reference to WarCabinet, 99, Minute 2, read a communication from the Field-Marshal Commanding the British Expeditionary Force to the effect-that General Nivelle did not consider, in view of the intelligence athis disposal, that an attack in roar of the Allied Lines in Flanders was probable in the near future, and that after visiting this region he considered the coast defences, for which the French were responsible, to be adequate.The First Sea Lord stated that he was not in accord with theview expressed as to the adequacy of the coast defences, and informed the War Cabinet that it would take at least six hours&apos; before a British Naval Force could be on the spot to interfersVwith anyattempt at landing,- and that even then it would be inferior in strength to the covering force.13. In reference to War Cabinet,, 99, Minute 16, the WarCabinet approved the Report of Lord Derby&apos;s Committee (paper g.T.-210) recommending that, in view of the shipping situationand the reports on the Portuguese Contingent already landed inbe transported should not he agreed to, and that the portuguese government should be approached with a view to the railway construction and Labour Battalions already arranged for havingpriority of shipping.In view of the sensitiveness &quot;of the Portuguese, the WarCabinet invited the Secretary of State for War to word his refusalso as to avoid giving any cause of offence to the portuguese government and nation.
Invasion. \ 14. The War Cabinet had under consideration the Report ofa Joint Admiralty and War Office Conference on the question of invasion, dated the 17th March, 1917 (War Cabinet, 97, Minute 3).(Paper G.T.-217.   Appendix I).The Field-Marshal Comnaanding-in-Chief the Home Forces,explained that the main line of defence was on the coast, and that,,in the event of the enemy reaching the coast, their first task wouldbe to force this line, and that 5 divisions, 2 of which were newdivisions in a very backward condition, were distributed as reserves to meet such a contingency. He further stated that, in spite of very carefully worked-out railway arrangements, further reinforce-ments could not be collected on the East Coast within less than36-45 hours.The general view of the experts present at the War cabinet was that, whilst an attempt at invasion could not be ruled out asabsolutely impossible, it was extremely unlikely that the enemy would carry it to a successful conclusion.Whilst concurring generally in the Joint Committee&apos;s Report,the War Cabinet decided that In view of the fact that the Committee had not heard the viewsof Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher of Kilverstone, a formal invitation should be sent to Lord Fisher to attend a Meeting of the War Cabinet, to give them the benefit ofhis views.The Secretary was instructed to take action accordingly.In regard to the point raised in the last paragraph of the JointCommittee&apos;s Report, as to the advisability of the despatch abroadof the one division at Home which could be sent, the Director ofMilitary Operations stated that the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff would bring the subject forward for the decision of the WarCabinet early in April.Evacuation of the 15. In reference to letters received by the Prime Minister fromIsle of Thanet. Lord North cliff e and from the Secretary to the Archbishop of canterbury on the subject of the recent withdrawal of schoolchildren from the Isle of Thanet, the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the Home Forces reported that he had, on the previous friday, in consequence of information received as to enemy action,ordered a state &quot; Vigilance,&quot; which state carried with it theassembling at their War Stations of certain of the Military Forcesin Great Britain. He stated that orders had been given that day for the troops to revert to their normal duties.Overland Route to 16. In reference to its previous decision (War Cabinet, 102,Salonica. Minute 4), the War Cabinet discussed, in the presence of theRailway and Shipping experts, the question of the development ofthe Overland Route through Italy to Salonica.Sir Guy Granet stated that the  development of the routepresented no difficulty from a technical and constructional point ofview.The Secretary of State for War explained, however, that thedifficulties arose mainly from the shortage of rolling-stock for the paramount and indispensable needs of the Allied Armies on theWestern Front, which had been accentuated by the increased strainproduced by following up the recent German withdrawal, and thatthe supply of this necessary material depended mainly on shipping.The Shipping Controller said that he expected that considerable assistance might be obtained for the shipping position if Americajoined the Allies, and that there Avas always the possibility of (neutral shipping (some 250 Dutch, Swedish, Danish, and Norwegianvessels) in British ports being requisitioned, which would he morepracticable if the United States entered the war.
Sidings, RestCamps, and Sheds.The First Sea Lord indicated the hope that some 2,000 trucks,at present employed in the conveyance of coal for the Fleet,might, in the near future, by means of re-organisation of the coalingarrangements, be released.Sir Guy Granet reported that four goods trains and onepassenger train per day would carry overland the same amount ofsupplies as was being shipped from the United Kingdom to Salonica.He outlined two schemes one for the transport of 1,200 tons aday and another for the transport of 2,000 tons ^explaining thatin the former case three months&apos; preparatory work would berequired for the provision of sidings, &amp;c, before transport could being, whilst in the latter case a longer time would be necessary.The War Cabinet approved the instructions already given bythe War Office for the immediate development of thenecessary sidings, rest camps, and sheds on the new route,in order that immediate advantage might be taken ofthe first moment when the necessary rolling-stock couldbe set free, either from the Western Front or from thiscountry.In view of the serious outlook for shipping in the Mediterranean,the War Cabinet decided that the War Office, in making their preliminary arrangements, should envisage thelargest possible development of this route, with a viewto the transportation of supplies to Egypt as well as to salonica.The War Cabinet took note that the development of the smallerscheme provides for the conveyance as far&apos;as Taranto of an amount equal to all the material now despatched from this country to salonica, and more.Provision of workmen byM. Venizelos.Congestion inPorts.The shipping situation.PossibleIntervention of theUnited States ofAmerica.17. The War Cabinet took note of a letter, dated 19th March,1917, from M. Gennadius to the Private Secretary to the PrimeMinister (Paper G.T.-247, Appendix II), on the subject of theprovision by him of labour for road construction.18. The Shipping Controller indicated his intention of pre-senting to the Secretary of State for War at an early date a schemefor night and day work in the ports, involving special labourarrangements, with a view to a more rapid turning round of theships.19. The Minister of Munitions called attention to the amountof railway material awaiting shipping at ports or works, as reportedin a Statement submitted by him (Appendix III).In view of the accumulating evidence that the submarineblockade and the increasing demands made upon tonnage by our-selves and our Allies were exercising a most serious influence onour shipping position, the Shipping Controller was asked again to review the whole situation. The Shipping Controller explained thathe had already done this in his Statement on the Mercantile marine and Shipping Programme, which he had just submitted for theMeeting of the Imperial War Cabinet (Paper G.T.-284).The question was adjourned for further consideration after discussion at the Imperial WTar Cabinet.20, Having regard to the great stress laid by the ShippingController on the importance, from a shipping point of view, of the.intervention of the United States of America in the war on the sideof the Allies, and also in view of the importance of such interventionfrom a financial point of view, the War Cabinet decided that It was desirable that, in the event of the intervention in theWar by the United States of America, a special Mission
should proceed to the United States for the purpose ofnotifying the relative importance of the various forms inwhich co-operation could he given. The War cabinet recognised, however, that it was essential for such a mission to have at its head some individual of the highestconsequence and authority, who would carry great weightwith the United States Government, and that the despatchof this Mission was contingent on the selection of such aleader.Agriculture :Corn ProductionBill.21. The War Cabinet had under consideration the corn production Bill, which had been drafted to give effect to thedecisions which had been reached by it on the 2lst February (WarCabinet, 76, Minute 8, 10). The discussion on this subject was adjourned for further study.Pood:The Food HoardingOrder.22. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of &quot; The FoodHoarding Order, 1917,&quot; proposed by the Ministry of Food (WarCabinet, 99, Minute 19) (Paper G.T.-257, Appendix IV). TheWar Cabinet decided to approve the issue of the Order, subject tothe following changes : Clause 3. Reference to Police to be omitted, and &quot; any personspecially authorised by the Food Controller,&quot; or words tothat effect, to be substituted.Clause 4 (6.). This clause to be re-drafted so as to exemptpersons in the habit of baking their own bread or curingtheir own bacon, or otherwise conserving foodstuffs intheir own homes.Strike of Engineersat Barrow.23, The Minister of Labour raised the question of the strike of engineers at Barrow, where the workmen alleged thatMessrs. Vickers have been cutting down the time-rates of the premium bonus system. The War Cabinet approved in principle adraft announcement to be made in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 26th March, and left its exact terms to be arranged by the Prime Minister, Mr. Bonar Law, and Mr. Hodge.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 26, 1917.(Initialled)      D.

APPENDIX I.G.T.-217. -Note by the Secretary,IN circulating this Report of a joint Admiralty and War Office Conference onInvasion, attention is drawn to the fact that the Conference do not appear to have pressed &quot; Lord Fisher to explain fully the grounds on which his apprehensions were based,&quot; as suggested by the War Cabinet (War Cabinet, 97 (3)).It is for consideration whether the War Cabinet should not themselves hear whatLord Fisher has to sav on the matter.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKER.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 20, 1917.A Conference was held in ,the Room of the Secretary of State for War, at-45 p.m., on the 16th March, 1917.Present :Secretary of-State for War.First Loi&apos;d of the Admiralty.First Sea Lord of the Admiralty.Chief of the Admiralty War Staff.Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Director of Military Operations.- .        Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces.Chief of the General Staff, Home Forces.1. The Secretary of State for War stated that the conference was held at therequest of the War Cabinet, in consequence of a communication on the subject of the invasion of Great Britain which the Prime Minister had received from Admiral of theFleet Lord Fisher.2. The First Sea Lord stated that in view of naval developments the Admiraltydesired to review the conclusion (ii) of the &quot; Report of a Conference between representatives of the Admiralty War Staff and the General Staff, held to consider thepossibility of an attack on the United Kingdom the 9th August, 1916,&quot; and to extend the time within which the enemy&apos;s landing operations could be effectively interruptedfrom the original estimate of from twenty-four to twenty-eight hours after the hostiletransports were sighted from the shore to from thirty-two to thirty-six hours afterthe hostile transports had been sighted from the shore.3. The Admiralty representative stated that the enemy still had sufficientshipping to transport 160,000 men to these shores, and the O.I.G.S. stated that theenemy would still be able to find that number of troops for the purpose of invasion,more especially as he is now increasing the number of his divisions in Belgium.4. The Admiralty representatives further stated that while invasion was possiblethey did not consider that, from a naval point of view, it was probable, in view of the grave risks which the enemy must run.The First Sea Lord stated that, in his opinion, the probability of a beach landingwas remote, as the risks involved were very great, and the C.I.G.S. added that the feasibility of landing a force of 160,000 men within thirty-six hours depended uponthe enemy being able to use the beaches.5. The Field-Marshal Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces,&apos;stated that the military aspect of the question was that the defences -on the coast were now in a far bettercondition to meet invasion than they were a year ago, and that in particular thenumber of machine-guns available at home, which was an important factor in thequestion, was much greater; on the other hand, the number of mobile troopsimmediately at the disposal of the Field-Marshal for Home Defence was, as a result ofthe War Cabinet decision of the 22nd January last, about 60,000 below his estimated requirements to meet an invasion by 160,000 men, and the quality of a considerableportion of his Divisions was poor. There was also the question of Ireland to beconsidered.
6. The Conference, after hearing the above expression of opinion, decided that thequestion of the number of troops to be maintained in Great Britain to meet invasionwas one of balancing the advantages of strengthening our oversea forces as againstthe risk of invasion, and could only he decided by the War Cabinet after periodicalreview of the general situation. ,At the present time there is only one Division at Home which could be sent abroad. It is now being prepared and will be ready in about a month&apos;s time. the advisability of its despatch should then be considered by the War Cabinet.(Initialled) E. C.D.E.J. R. J.W. R.
