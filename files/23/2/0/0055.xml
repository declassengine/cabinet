It was also reported that the Officer Commanding the Russian 9th Army in roumania had been removed from his Command and that his Chiefof Staff had been placed under arrest.Other information with regard to the lack of discipline and the spread of the extremist movement to Moscow and Odessa was communicated by Lord Robert Cecil.
India. 2. The Chief of the  Imperial General  Staff stated that theCommander-in-Chief in India had telegraphed to say that, owingto the recent trouble on the North-West Frontier and the necessity * %for maintaining a force adequate to administer punishment to the tribesmen concerned, and to meet any eventualities at what appearedto be a somewhat precarious time, he considered it necessary to keepin India the seven battalions of Territorials which had been destined for Egypt, and the three battalions of Native troops which were tohave been sent to East Africa, in exchange for three battalions therewhich needed to be relieved.Salonica. 3. J.n reference to War Cabinet  128,  Minute 5, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff stated that General Milne had reported that when the two cavalry brigades and one division were withdrawn he would have withdrawn a portion of his line from the struma River, and had requested that one regiment of the twoMounted Brigades which were to be withdrawn should be left behind. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had agreed thatone regiment should be the last unit to leave of those to be sentaway.Though   the   Serbians  had   effected   something,  the recentoffensive of the Salonica Force had resulted in no material advance.-fjo-e Western Front. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that out of the original 49 reserve divisions which theGermans had had on the Western front, all except five had now been thrown into the fight, but that they still had a total of 63 divisions which had not yet been used in the fight, though several of these......     were of indifferent quality.    German divisions were undoubtedlybeing transferred from the Eastern to the Western front, but thefigure of 40 divisions given in a recent report was whollyexaggerated.French Military 5 The subject of the military policy of the French came under0 1C^&apos; discdssion in connection with a letter written by General Sir H. Wilsonto the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, which showed that thequestion of the Chief Command of the French Armies had not been finally settled, and that consequently the nature of the co-operationbetween the French and British Armies was not as definite as itshould be, notwithstanding the decision reached at the Conferencein Paris on the 3rd-4th May, 1917. It was obvious that the uncertainty of&apos; the situation was due to political causes.The Prime Minister undertook to allude to this matter in aletter which he was about to send by special messenger toM. Ribot.6. In reference to telegram No. 1902, dated the 12th May, 1917,from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egypt, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that the only obstacle to sending out the 9,000 men asked for was the question of shipping. As amatter of fact, 7,500 of them were actually waiting at Marseilles.Egypt.?Submarines.?7. The First Sea Lord detailed the losses from submarine attackduring the previous three days.J)
1 b bDestruction of 8. The First Sea Lord reported that the Zeppelin &quot; L 22 &quot; had&quot;L- 22- been destroyed by British Naval Forces on the morning of ther ; 14th May, near Terschelling.Coal for Italy.Restriction ofShipping to the atlantic.9. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that AdmiralSims had received instructions from the United States of America tomake enquiries iuto the coal supply of Italy, which, according to theinformation received in America, was very low. The First Sea Lordstated that a recent Foreign Office telegram had specified that itwould be better if American ships were sent to &quot;England to load the coal lying there. He himself, however, was not sure if thiswas the right course to pursue. Though the distance from Cardiffto Gibraltar was only 1,850 miles as compared with 3,300 fromHampton roads to Gibraltar, the latter Oas by far the safer route ofthe two. He thought, on the whole, that the best course would beto send the coal direct from the United States to Italy.It was decided that This matter should be dealt with later, in conjunction with theShipping Controller.10. In reference to three Memoranda by Sir Leo Chiozza Money,M.P. (Papers G.T.-660, dated the 4th May, 1917 ; G.T.-698, datedthe 7th May, 1917; G.T.-711, dated the 11th May, 1917) and aMemorandum (Paper G..T.-697, dated the 10th May, 1917) by theShipping Controller, detailing a suggested system of restricting theBritish mercantile marine to the Atlantic routes and maintaining areserve of ships, it appeared that the Admiralty and the Ministry ofShipping were in favour of the adoption of some such scheme.The War Cabinet decided The matter should be investigated by a small Joint Committee,to be summoned by the First Sea Lord, composed ofrepresentatives of The Board of Admiralty,The Board of Trade,The Shipping Controller, andThe Ministry of Munitions,which should report as early as possible to the War Cabinet.Russia PossibleDefection.11. In reference to the Report on &quot;Policy in view of RussianDevelopments,&quot; by Lord Curzon (Paper G.T.-703), dated the12th May, 1917 (War Cabinet 134, Minute 4), a discussion tookplace on the Russian question and its bearings on the generalsituation.Lord Robert Cecil was instructed to send a telegram to Sir E.Howard, at Stockholm, requesting him to clear up theposition as regards the various proposed SocialisticConferences.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 14, 1917.
