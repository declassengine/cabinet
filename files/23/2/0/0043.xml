Submarine Menace 1. THE War Cabinet bad under consideration a Report bysand Food Supply. tne First Sea Lord of the Admiralty (G.T.-519) (Appendix I),relative to the submarine menace and the food supply, in which their attention was particularly drawn to the following points : (a.) The increasingly heavy losses of our merchant ships by mine and submarine attack.(b.) The necessity for the provision of patrol vessels, &amp;c.(c.) The failure of the existing type of mine to prevent theegress of the German submarines from their bases.(d.) The necessity, Avhilst we possess the shipping required forthe purpose, to build up such a reserve of food in thecountry as will enable the population to be fed until thesubmarine menace can be got under control.(e.) The building of mammoth unsinkable ships so as to ensureour obtaining supplies during the latter part of 1918.Gross Tonnage 2. Sir Leo Chiozza Money stated (Appendix II) that the grossAvailable. tonnage on the  registers of  the United Kingdom and british dominions on the 1st January, 1917, was 16,788,000 tons ; that on the1st May it would approximate to 15,467,000 tons ; and that by the endof 1917 it might be estimated, after making an ample allowance forwar losses, losses by war damage and marine losses, at 12,862,000 tons.He further stated that in this estimate he had made thenecessary allowance for new construction, ships purchased, and fordamaged ships repaired, and that he had arrived at the conclusionthat, if the present tonnage (8,050,000 tons) appropriated for theuse of the Navy and Army and that retained abroad for other reasons remained as at present, the total tonnage available for theimports for the United Kingdom w^ould only amount to 4,812,000tons on the 31st December, 1917. as against 8,394,000 tons on the1st January, 1917.The figure given by the First Sea Lord as to the estimatedlosses approximated to that arrived at by Sir Leo Chiozza Money.The Shipping Controller was of opinion that it would not be safe to count on more than 500,000 tons of extra shipping from theUnited States of America as an addition to British shipping after taking into account the assistance that they might render from ashipping point of view to the Allies, though such help would mean a corresponding release of our shipping that was now appropriatedfor Allied requirements. He estimated that there would be eightand a half to ten weeks&apos; supply of wheat in the country at the endof May.Sir Leo Chiozza Money then proceeded to explain to the Cabinetthe effect that the reduction of shipping would have on our imports.Shipping Available 3. He stated that on the 1st January, 1917, after making the for Imports. necessary allowances for ships appropriated for War services, &amp;c,and assuming that that remained a constant until the end of theyear, we had 8,394,000 tons available for the carriage of imports.On the 31st December, 1917, however, he roughly estimatedthat the amount would be reduced to only 4,812,000 tons, which meant that, after making an allowance for the cargoes brought in by neutral ships, and also taking into account the policy ofshortened routes which was being adopted, we should by Decemberonly be able to import monthly a total of 2,030,000 tons, as against3,000,000 tons last January. This meant a total reduction of no less than 15,000,000 tons on last year&apos;s imports.
Army 5. The Director of Contracts, War Office, stated that the ArmyEequirements. requirements amounted to about 428,000 tons a month, but that only about 224,000 of this amount was imported into the UnitedKingdom in unrequisitioned ships, the remainder being dischargeddirect at the various theatres of war abroad.Horses, Mules, andFodder.Salonica ShippingEequirements.6. With regard to the importation of horses and mules forthe War Office, the transport required was 8,900 tons of shipping amonth. In addition, for the fodder for the horses in all theatres of war, carrying capacity to the extent of 151,000 tons was necessaryevery month. Of this tonnage rather over 90,000 tons per monthwas req-uired for France.Sir Leo Chiozza Money explained that about 150 merchant ships, with a gross tonnage of 660,000 tons, were employed inconnection with the British Expeditionary Force in Salonica.Timber. 7. The Director of Timber Supplies stated that the stocks of timber had fallen by 60 per cent, during the past four months, andthat there were apparently only three months&apos; supplies in hand. Wecould, he thought, trust to home production to provide the requiredamount of pit-wood, except for the collieries of South Wales. Butthe home production of sawn timber was exceedingly small comparedwith the amount which was needed indispensably for war purposes.He instanced the large irreducible consumption in the manufactureof ammunition boxes, only a fifth of which were returned.Munitions. 8. With regard to the importation of manufactured munitions and iron and manganese ores, &amp;c, the Minister of Munitions pointedout that he proposed to postpone until August next the shipment of8-inch and 9&quot;2-inch shells from America, which woidd mean a post-ponement until after August of the transport of a total of about20,000 tons. With regard to the importation of iron-ores, &amp;c, he stated that we received from abroad between 600,000 and 800,000tons a month, but that he hoped by next August to be producingat the rate of some 200,000 additional tons a month from homesources, and had taken steps to alter a large number of foundriesso as to enable them to deal with home productions of ore, which required different treatment from foreign ores. The monthlyimportations by the Ministry of Munitions amounted to 1,400,000tons.ISuddin. v    v WiVe^d .t0^teel^f?r  shiPMdmg, the Minister ofpouuaing. Munitions informed the War Cabinet that he had made arrange-ments to release almost immediately about 2,500 tons per week anda further amount of about 2,500 tons a week in the near future,alter certain Italian commitments had come to an end.The Minister of Munitions emphasised the point, however, that increases m steel production depended entirely upon increasedsupphee of ore, and that our capacity for steel production was atCereals Kequired. 4. The Food Controller informed the War Cabinet that it wasnecessary to import 1,425,000 tons of cereals every month (including150,000 tons to build up stocks), which would, on the basis of theimport capacity estimated by Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in May onlyleave approximately the necessary shipping for 800,000 tons offurther imports.
present in excess of the supplies of ore. He stated that Mr. Fordwas contemplating laying down in the South of Ireland slips forshiphuilding, and he advocated a large increase generally in thisdirection in the United Kingdom, adding that, by utilising four ofthe existing munition factories, a great deal could he done toincrease the.output of marine engines.The Shipping Controller stated that many of the yards wereshort of labour, but that, as more steel became available, a certain,additional amount could be worked into the ships in spite of thelabour difficulty, and that probably another 90,000 men were requiredto carry out the estimated maximum shipbuilding programme.Cotton, Tobacco,and Fertilisers.Civil Requirements.10. The President of the Board of Trade informed the WarCabinet that there was enough cotton in the United Kingdom to last four months, and that our imports of this article amounted to approximately 1,000,000 tons per annum. As regards tobaccoand fertilisers, we imported annually 70,000 and 400,000 tons respectively. It was stated by Sir Leo Money that the importsrequired for the civilgpopulation monthly amounted to 553,000 tons.Mammoth&quot; Unsinkable &quot;Ships.11. The First Sea Lord of the Admiralty asked the WarCabinet to consider the question of building mammoth &quot; unsinkable &quot;ships (War Cabinet 117, Minute 16). He stated that he had haddesigns prepared for a vessel 800 feet long, with a draught of36 feet, that was practically unsinkable, and had a dead-weightcapacity of 40,000 tons. It was estimated by his technical advisersthat one or two such ships could be built in a year, and that four or five could be completed in from fifteen to eighteen months.The Shipping Controller added that one such ship was equivalent, as regards steel requirements, to eight or nine steamersof 8,000 tons capacity, and that that number of vessels should only take six months to build.Timber.Airship Sheds.Increase in shipbuilding.Naval shipbuilding programme.12. As a preliminary to the further restriction of imports,development of shipbuilding, &amp;c, the War Cabinet decided that (a.) After the discharge of timber cargoes now leaded or loading,no further timber should be shipped until the sanction ofthe War Cabinet had been obtained, and that suchsanction would not be given until the Departmentdesiring such timber had fully established the urgent necessity for its importation before the War Cabinet;(b.) On account of the shortage of steel, the First Lord of theAdmiralty should enquire into the strategic aspect ofdiscontinuing the building of airships, so as to save theerection of the sheds required for housing them.(c.) The Shipping Controller, after consultation with certainshipbuilders, should report to the Cabinet at an earlydate:  (1.) How many more standard merchant ships couldbe built with the present supply of labour andan increased supply of steel the extra amountof steel so required being stated.(2.) If the quantity of steel was unlimited, what werethe additional resources for shipbuilding, and what additional labour would be required totake full advantage of the extra material.(d.) The First Sea Lord should enquire and report as to whateffect, if any, the entry of the United States of Americainto the War would have on the Naval shipbuilding programme to 1918.
Reduction of army Horses.Civil Requirements.&quot; Unsinkable &quot;Ships.(e.) The War Office should submit a statement showing how a reduction of (a) 25 per cent, and, alternatively, (6)50 per cent, of the number of horses for which they areresponsible would, if ordered by the Cabinet, be spreadover the various Army services, specifying in each casewhat amount, if any, of light motor transport would benecessary in lieu.(/.) The War Office should ascertain and report as soon aspossible the number of horses used by the French forexample, on the Western Front in the units of each oftheir Army services, and at the same time furnish astatement comparing with these similar numbers in theBritish organisation.(g.) The President of the Board of Trade should furnish theWar Cabinet at an early date with the details of theimports (553,000 tons a month) said to be required forthe civil population.(h.) A Meeting should be held at 3t6 p.m. on the 24th April,to consider the proposal of the First Sea Lord withregard to the building of mammoth unsinkable merchant ships, and that Lord Pirrie, the First Lord, the First sea lord, the Director of  Naval  Construction,  and  theShipping Controller should be invited to attend.Men-of-war asWheat Carriers.13. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet, in reply totheir enquiries as to what old men-of-war were available forconversion into wheat carriers in case of the greatest emergency i.e.,our being face to face with starvation that only a few old battle-ships were available.The War Cabinet requested him further to consider the wholequestion of the possible utilisation of the old British and Alliedwarships for the transport of wheat or other commodities, or in therelief of merchant ships now employed for Naval or military purposes, and report on the subject in due course.14. The &quot;War Cabinet decided To resume consideration of this subject at an early date.(Initialled)d. li. a.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,April 24,. 1917.
APPENDIX I.ftThe Submarine Menace and Food Supply.(Memorandum by the First Sea Lord.)IT is necessary to call the very serious attention of the War Cabinet to the increasingly heavy losses of our merchant ships by mine and submarine attack. Itappears quite evident that the situation calls for immediate action and the adoption ofsuch measures as are possible, both to minimise further losses and to ensure suchrapidity of construction as will enable us to replace the ships lost with sufficienttonnage to allow of a continuance of the war.The serious nature of the position is best shown by the following figures : Losses between the 1st and the 18th April inclusive.1	Submarines.		Mines.		Total.		No. &apos;	Gross Tons.	No.	Gross Tons.	No.	Gross Tons.British Allied    ... Neutral  ...	65 47 57	218,094 90,399 98,404	5 1	11,269 1,095	70 47 58	229,363 90,399 99,499Total	169	406,897	6	12,364    1	175	419,261Comment is Unnecessary in the face of comparison with figures for former months.An even more serious feature of the case is the exceedingly heavy losses that havebeen reported during the last few days, ejg.For the twenty-four hours ending noon, the 20th April, nine British ships, ofa total of 27,074 tons, were reported sunk; and, in addition, three others were damaged, but are being towed into port.For the twenty-fours ending noon, the 21st April, nine British ships, of a totalof 29,705, tons, were reported sunk.It is true that some of the vessels mentioned in these two latter statements were sunk on the 18th April and are therefore included in the total for the period from the1st to the 18th April, but the point to which I wish particularly to direct attention isthat reports of so large a number of vessels being sunk have come to hand in twosuccessive periods of twenty-four hours. It is obvious that the continuance of such separately of loss for even a few days will produce the most serious results.The only immediate remedy that is possible is the provision of as many destroyers and other patrol vessels as can be provided by the United States of America, and admiral De Chair has been directed to represent to the United States authorities the urgency of the matter ; also Rear-Admiral Sims, of the United States Navy, has, at my request, sent a telegram couched in strong terms pointing out the gravity of thesituation.... Until means can be found and provided for a more extended attack on. submergedenemy submarines, the only palliative consists in the provision of a sufficient numberof small craft to keep them-submerged, and so cramp their activities.The various methods for attacking submerged submarines in the open sea are bybombs dropped from aircraft, by depth charges dropped from patrol vessels, by paravaneattack, and by heavy shell in the nature of depth charges fired by patrol vessels. Thethree former weapons are already in use to the full extent of our resources. every possible effort is being made to manufacture and supply howitzers throwing heavyshell to explode under water, but our efforts have been much interfered with by labourstrikes, with the result that the supply of these weapons so urgently needed is greatlydelayed.The measures which were &apos;to a certain extent successful against enemy submarines
when surface attacks were common, and which comprised defensive armament ofmerchant ships, the employment of decoy ships, and the provision of smoke-makingapparatus, have all diminished very much in value since the submerged attack by thesubmarine became common.The obvious remedy of endeavouring to prevent the egress of submarines fromtheir bases by the use of mines has been carried out to the fullest extent compatible with our supply of mines. Mines are laid in German waters as fast as they are produced by the manufacturers, but I have reasons to fear that our present pattern of mine is not satisfactory against submarines; otherwise it is hardly credible that, with the largenumber that have been laid in the last four months, the losses in submarines would nothave been very heavy. The new type of mine, which will undoubtedly be satisfactoryagainst submarines, is only in the early stages of manufacture, and no considerabledeliveries will take place before July.There is a period, therefore, until July, during which we are bound to face mostserious losses, and the proper course of action appears to me to be to build up whilstwe still possess the shipping necessary for the purpose such a reserve of food in thiscountry as will enable the population to be fed when the time arrives as it surelywill when our shipping will be at a very low ebb, and we shall not have benefited bythe use of the German ships now interned in America, or by new tonnage which maybe produced by America or by this country.There is one further and most important matter to be considered, and that is our supplies for next year. There are two separate and distinct policies in regard to ship-building which we might adopt. The first is to build a very large number of smallmerchant ships which would be more immune from submerged attack than largervessels owing to the small target they present, and to the dispersion due to their largemxmbers ; and, secondly, the provision of a few of the largest ships that can be designed. Ships of this latter type could be made practically unsinkable, and, beingfew in number, we could afford sufficient destroyers to escort them through dangerouswaters, and so render them safe against submarine or mine attack.The Admiralty have proposed both these alternatives. Neither has been adopted,but instead a type of vessel midway between the two alternatives a vessel which is,by her eize, vulnerable to attack, and is yet so small that large numbers are required,making the provision of escort impossible.I am certain that it is essential for the security of the country that some vessels ofthe largest type should be immediately constructed, and that they should be given priority over everything else; if this were done, I believe that they would be runningby the summer of 1918.All considerations as to whether they will be paying concerns commercially shouldbe swept aside ruthlessly, in view of the danger facing us that all the sacrifices whichthe country has made may be negatived by the menace of starvation.April 22, 1917.
