4. In continuation of the discussion on the 26th March (WarCabinet, 104, Minute 14), Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher ofKilverstone gave his views on the question of invasion. Afterrecalling that he had formerly been a strong disbeliever in the praticability of invasion, Lord Fisher gave the following reasonsfor believing that invasion was now feasible : (a.) His diminished confidence, owing to the withdrawal from,the command of the Grand Fleet of Admiral Sir JohnJellicoe, whom, without disparaging Admiral Sir DavidBeatty, he had always regarded as the best man andexceptionally qualified for the post, and whom he himself, when in office, had for many years designated as Admiralissimo in time of war.(6.) The increasing German submarine menace ; the numbersof enemy submarines, he pointed out, were now verylarge, and their sea-keeping qualities were increased.(c.) The demonstration at Gallipoli of the practicability, notonly of landing in the face of fire, but of maintaining the expedition on beaches which were under continuousfire.(d.) The fact that the German Fleet is under the higher command of a &quot;military officer, namely, Field-MarshalHindenburg. He pointed out that a military officermight order the Fleet to take risks which no naval officer would contemplate, and instanced the case ofVilleneuve being ordered to sea by Napoleon.(e.) The risks to the Grand Fleet from mines and submarines in its passage to the vicinity of the landing-places.(/.) The recent increase in the size of the German Army, whichrendered the requisite number of troops available.(g.) The fact that ample transport is available, 45 per cent, ofthe German mercantile marine being at Hamburg and bremen, as well as small craft at Emden, suitable fordisembarkation purposes.In view of the above circumstances, Lord Fisher stated thathe bad felt bound to lay before the Prime Minister his views,namely, that invasion was now feasible.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, while not denying the feasibility of an actual landing, stated that the Joint conference had been much influenced by the consideration that the enemy would not be able to maintain his communications, and that hewould like to hear Lord Fishers opinion on this point.Lord Fisher considered that the danger of invasion was under-stated by the following summary of the views of experts, containedin War Cabinet, 104, Minute 14: &quot; The general view of the exjjerts present at the War cabinet was that, whilst an attempt at invasion could not be ruled out as absolutely impossible, it was extremely unlikelythat the enemy would attempt it, or carry it to a successful conclusion.&quot;He pointed out that the impossibility of maintaining surface craft in particular localities for any length of time under modern conditions increased the difficulty of any permanent interruption ofthe lines of communications. Apart from the return of admiral sir John Jellicoe to the command of the Grand Fleet, Lord Fisherstated that without full information of the Admiralty&apos;s existingdispositions he could offer no suggestion for dealing with thismenace.The War Cabinet thanked Lord Fisher for the statement of his views, and undertook to give them careful consideration in their examination of the problem of Home Defence.
5. The War Cabinet pressed Lord Fisher more particularly inregard to a statement in his letter to the First Lord, dated the1st February, 1917, to the effect that he had given Admiral Jellicoe&quot; a plan for dealing effectively with the German submarinemenace.&quot; Lord Fisher stated that these words referred to hishaving offered to serve under Sir John Jellicoe as Controller of theNavy, in order to provide more effectually than at present all theapparatus requisite to subdue the German submarine menace.He referred to a very secret device, which the Admiralty havealready mentioned to the War Cabinet, and on which four separate and independent investigators are at work.Lord Fisher suggested that the number of these instrumentsordered was insufficient.The First Sea Lord stated that 750 sets of one type had been ordered, but Lord Fisher suggested that sufficient sets of the besttype had not been ordered.The representatives of the Admiralty stated that the Board ofInvention and Research had not recommended the adoption forgeneral use of the type referred to by Lord Fisher, but that 100 setshad been ordered for experimental purposes on the recommendationof the Board of Invention and Research.Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Peirse, the Vice-Chairman of theBoard of Invention and Research, stated, however, that the Board ofInvention and Research had not considered that recommendations for the adoption of any particular apparatus for general use came within their functions. This came rather within the province ofthe Admiralty Representatives on the Board of Invention and research.Rear-Admiral Duff, the Director of Anti-Submarine Warfare,gave a full resume of the orders given for anti-submarine devices ofthe nature referred to. It transpired that 750 sets of one type ofthe device had been ordered, and that 2,400 of a different typewere already in use afloat.Without making any observations on the attitude of theAdmiralty towards this particular device, the War Cabinet tookparticular note of the agreement among the experts that at presentthe particular device referred to by Lord Fisher, though promising,did not provide any immediate solution of the submarine problem,and could not be looked upon as other than a. part of -the systememployed for the destruction of submarines. Lord Fisher referredto a Memorandum by his scientific colleagues which, as they fely strongly on the subject, he stated he would forward to the PrimeMinister.6. With reference to War Cabinet, 91, Minute 7, the First sea lord informed the War Cabinet that he now had received furtherinformation in regard to Mr. Edison&apos;s reported submarine detector,and had ascertained that it was a signalling apparatus with thecapabilities of which the Admiralty were fully acquainted, andwhich had been in use in the Navy for some years.7. The First Sea Lord read a telegram from Russia in regardto the state of the Russian Baltic Fleet, containing particulars of very serious disorders, and indicating that, whilst the situation atHelsingfors was fairly normal, the state of affairs at Kronstad was unsatisfactory, though improving, and, generally speaking, the discipline in the Baltic Fleet had Aveakened considerably.
Russian Offensive, 8. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on the postponement of.      subject of a Memorandum by General Alexeieff, forwarded byGeneral Hanbury-Williams (Appendix I).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he had only just received this communication, and, before giving hisconsidered view in regard to it, he would like to communicate withField-Marshal Sir Douglas Hais: and General Niveile. In themeantime, as a preliminary expression of opinion, he consideredthat we should make no material alterations in our plans asregards the Western Front. He had, however, already com-municated with General Alexnieff in regard to the great importanceof avoiding any delay in the Russian operations in the Caucasus, assuch delay might react seriously on our position in Mesopotamia.While, therefore, deferring further consideration of thisquestion, the War Cabinet note that the decisions of the PetrogradConference are completely upset.The Labour 9. With  reference  to  War  Cabinet, 104,  Minute   5, Mr.Deputation. Henderson reported that Mr. Thomas would not be able to go toRussia, He believed that Mr. Thome and Mr. 0&apos;Grady would be willing to accompany the deputation, and he hoped that LieutenantSanders might also be available, which the Secretary of State forWar stated would be practicable.The general view of the War Cabinet was in favour of a reliableRussian Socialist being attached to the Mission as an interpreter,and of the addition of a more academic Socialist of the type of Mr.Hyndman.Prisoners of War. 10. The War Cabinet had under consideration the Report ofLord Derby&apos;s Committee (G.T.-266, Appendix II) on the Exchangeof Prisoners of War, prepared in accordance with War Cabinet, 95,Minute 1, and decided that (a.) A general exchange of interned civilians was impracticableand not in the interests of the State.(6.) The Secretary of State for War should take the necessary steps, in conjunction with the Foreign Office, to ascertain the views of the French Government on the proposal that officers and men who had been in captivity for twoyears or more should be interned in Switzerland or someother neutral State.(c.) The Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and the Admiralty should take the requisite action to give effect to the proposals of lord derby&apos;s Committee with regard to the question of effecting an exchange of British and Indian prisoners ofwar for Turkish.(d.) The question of the employment of prisoners of war andthe publication of the facts relating to the imprisonmentof two German Officers should be deferred for con-sideration at a later date.(Initialled) D.

APPENDIX I.From General Hanbury Williams to G.I G.S., March 26, 1917.0     (913.)FOLLOWING is complete translation of memorandum referred to in my 914 : &quot; Presenting my respects to the representative of British Military Mission atRussian G.H.Q., I regard it as my conscientious duty, in order to avoid the serious consequences which might arise from the omission to express frankly my opinion ofthe possibility of fulfilling decisions arrived at in the course of the PetrogradConference: &quot;First, letter just received from the Minister of War points out that the interior,political commotions have had a serious effect on the condition of ourreserve (dep6t) units throughout the entire country.   They are in a state of moral confusion, and cannot be employed as reinforcements for three or four months, that is, earlier June-July.&quot; Second, the same causes and effects hear equal relation to the cavalry of thewhole army.&quot;Above situation necessitates looking facts straight in the eyes, and stating with complete frankness that we cannot assume the offensive here at the commencement ofMay (old style), and can count upon participation on a large scale only in June-July.Position allows to the enemy the possibility of concentrating all his reserves on theFrench front, or with greatly increased [? group omitted], to fall upon us, profitingby our temporary period of weakness. Circumstances should, I think, entail certainalterations in consideration of operations in the near future, and influence decisionsarrived at at the Petrograd Conference.&quot; in particular must be considered General Nivelle&apos;s communication, dated the16th March, that he will employ the whole strength of the French Armies for an offensive on the West front, in order to obtain a definite result.&quot; Obligatory and unavoidable (for their preservation for the future) inactivity ofthe Russian Armies in the next few months, in my opinion, calls for French Army notto be exhausted, and for its reserves to be kept until compatible with the time when,with joint forces, we shall be in a position to attack enemy on all fronts.&quot;Sixth, I think also that it would be more expedient, under the circumstancesof our enforced inaction, that the British-French Armies at least should follow upenemy&apos;s retreat slowly and prudently, and should also occupy new and strong lines ofdefence. This does not refer to decisive attack by British-French Armies on enemy in retreat on strongly fortified lines, perhaps intending some large manoeuvre in openwarfare, where freedom of movement of reserves might give a favourable opportunityto one side or the other.&quot; But in such an operation, enemy, who is based on prepared, strongly fortifiedpositions, would possess an undoubted advantage.&quot;JO
G.T.-266.APPENDIX II.Prisoners of War Sub-Committee.Minutes of a Meeting held at the War Office on Friday, March 16, 1917,at 4*30 p.m.Present:The Right Hon. the Earl of Derby, K.G., G.O.V.O., C.B., Secretary of Statefor War (in the Ohair).The Right Hon. Lord Newton, Directorof Prisoners Department.Mr. J. E. Hope, M.P., Chairman of the prisoners of War employment committees.Lieutenant General Sir H. E. Belfield,E.C.B., D.S.O., Director of Prisoners ofWar, War Office.Brigadier-General C. K. Cockerill, C.B.,Sub-Director of Military Intelligence,War Office.Major C. L. Storr, Secretary.IN accordance with War Cabinet instructions (War Cabinet, 95, Minute 1), theCommittee assembled to consider the following questions :  (a.) The exchange of British and German interned civilians,(b.) The employment of prisoners of war.1. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by Lord Newton, dated the3rd March, 1917 (G.T.-92 (Annxeure A) ), in which it was pointed out that therewere interned in Germany approximately 4,500 British civilians, whereas therewere in the British Empire about 36,000 Germans, 30,000 of whom were of military age; that a formidable agitation was in progress in Great Britain to secure a generalexchange of these civilians; that the only justification for an exchange of sodisproportionate a nature rested upon humanitarian grounds; that there was reason tobelieve that statements regarding conditions at Ruhleben were greatly exaggerated, andthat, even if the dispaiity in numbers were reduced by the addition of Frenchcivilians, the difficulties of transporting the many thousands of Germans by sea would remain almost insuperable.The Committee were unanimously of the opinion that^-1. Any increase of the resources in man-power of the Central Powers must tendto prolong the War, and that as the War is to a great extent one ofattrition, the best and really most humane course to follow is to place and keep out of action as many of the enemy as possible.2. Taking all the circumstances into consideration, and more especially in viewof the disparity of the numbers involved, the. proposal of a generalexchange of interned civilians should not, in the interests of the State, be entertained, and they should report to the War Cabinet accordingly.2. The Committee further considered a suggestion that endeavours should bemade through diplomatic channels to effect an arrangement with the GermanGovernment whereby officers and men who have been in captivity for over two years,might he interned in Switzerland or in some other neutral country.The Committee took into consideration the following points : (a.) That under existing conditions the Swiss Government would not be preparedto accommodate more than a limited number of such prisoners of bothnationalities.(b.) That we have undertaken to waive any claim on Norway for such purposes in favour of Russia.
The Committee recommended that (1.) The War Office should designate what neutral countries were open to leastobjection for this purpose.(2.) If the War Cabinet approve the suggestion in principle, the views of theFrench Government should, in the first instance, be ascertained.3. The Committee considered the question of effecting an exchange of Britishand Indian Prisoners of War for Turkish.The Committee recommended that (1.) The Turkish Government be invited through the proper channels to cometo a mutual arrangement with His Majesty&apos;s Government for theexchange of 600 prisoners on each side as a preliminary to a widerexchange.(2.) The selection of the men to be exchanged should he left to the captorGovernment.(3.) Officers and men, both of British and Indian nationality, in strict proportion to their relative numbers, should be included under the terms of theexchange.(4.) The Admiralty be asked to report if, and when, shipping could be providedfor the conveyance of the prisoners.(5.) The  proposal  should  be  for  unconditional   repatriation,   and  not  for internment.(6.) If the War Cabinet approve the proposal, the Russian Government should beinformed of the action taken.4. The Committee examined the question of the employment of Prisoners of War.They had before them a letter (G.T.-81) (Annexure B) dated the 20th January, 1917,from the Secretary to the Prisoners of War Employment Committee to the Secretaryto the War Cabinet, which stated that the number of such prisoners applied for by government Departments alone already far exceeds the available supply, and whichsuggested that Prisoners of war, especially those skilled in agriculture and engineering, should,if possible, be released from France for work in the United Kingdom, theirplaces in France being taken by Turkish prisoners of war now in Egypt.After due consideration, the Committee decided that there were many difficultiesin the way of carrying into effect the above proposal, and that no material advantageswere likely to be gained by its adoption,5. The Committee considered the suggestion that Schleswig-Holstein desertersfrom the German Army, of whom there were about 7,000 in Denmark, might be conveyed to and employed in the United Kingdom. It was understood that the danish authorities favoured the proposal.The Committee decided that Mr. Hope, M.P., Chairman of the Prisoners of War Employment Committee,should take up the question in consultation with the Home Department andand Foreign Office.6. The Committee also considered a suggestion that the facts relating to theimprisonment of two German &quot;officers in retaliation for the imprisonment of two british officers Lieutenant Lamble and Lieutenant Bate should be published, andLord Derby undertook to bring the suggestion before the War Cabinet.(Initialled) D.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,March 16, 1917.)
