Eeprisals. 11. The Secretary of State for War brought to the notice ofthe War Cabinet a case in which a German prisoner had beenv,p    e -K-ameruns-        captured in the Kameruns with explosive bullets in his possession,and informed them that the man had been tried by court-martialand sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Since that date theGermans had taken reprisals by placing two of our officers, who hadbeen on a sporting expedition, had sOft-nosed bullets in their possession, and were taken from the &quot; Appam,&quot; in solitary coufine-ment.The question of further reprisals was touched upon, and theSecretary of State for War stated that he had received information from the Netherlands Government to the effect that the Germanswant us to reconsider the rinding of our court-martial on theGerman arrested in the Kameruns, and would be quite satisfied toabide by the conclusion arrived at by our Law Officers of the Crownif we were prepared to bring all the evidence in the case beforethem.

The War Cabinet had under consideration the PrimeMinisters report of his Conference at the Admiralty on the 30thApril, 1917 (G.T.-601). In regard to a recommendation that a business man should be appointed as a member of the Board ofAdmiralty to superintend the whole of the shipbuilding and thesupply of material for Naval purposes, the First Lord pointed outthat such functions were already provided for in the duties assig-nedby Mr. Churchill to the Additional Civil Lord, although in fact thoseduties appear to have remained dormant. He stated that the FirstSsea Lord and himself were in complete agreement with regard tothis recommendation, and were prepared to amplify, if necessary,the scope of the duties as assigned by Mr. Churchill to such an appointment. They laid stress, however, on the importance of theappointment of someone who had the complete confidence of theWar Cabinet.The War Cabinet considered that the best available man wouldhave to be appointed to this post, and that, in view of the paramount importance of the shipping situation, nothing should stand in theway of this appointment. There was a general agreement that,having regard to his record in this War, Major-General Sir eric geddes would be the most suitable person if he were willing toundertake the duties.   The War Cabinet saw Major-General Geddes
and invited him to accept the appointment. He undertook toconsider the matter and to reply as soon as possible.Charge of all 14. The War Cabinet&quot; also felt that, having regard to the shipbuilding. intimate connection between shipbuilding for the purposes of theBoyal Navy, the mercantile marine, and the War Office inland waterways, there should be a very close association between the holder of the new office and the shipbuilding side of the ShippingControllers Committee, and a proposal was made that the newAdmiralty Civil Lord should exercise a measure of control over all three Departments, as far as they were engaged in shippingconstruction, after the general policy had been laid down by theWar Cabinet.A decision as to this extension of duties was postponed untilthe reply of Sir E. Geddes was received.Reorganisation of 15. With regard to the proposals of the Prime Minister for thethe Admiralty reorganisation of the War Staff, the First Lord, whilst agreeing toWar Staff! these proposals, said that he was not entirely satisfied that the new arrangements would relieve the First Sea Lord of detail to theextent that he considered necessary for the production of the bestresults.The First Sea Lord insisted strongly that, in order to bringabout this result, a considerable alteration of method of dealingwith papers at the Admiralty was required, and that decentralisationwas necessary in the work of the Civil Branches of the Admiralty,which the War Cabinet were given to understand was the subjectof investigation by the First Lord.WirelessTelegraphyOperators.16. In connection with the proposal (Appendix, Section (/))for increasing the number of wireless telegraphy operators, the WarCabinet recommended the Admiralty to obtain assistance, if possible,from the United States of America and from the Dominions,Approved 17. The recommendations as finally approved by the WarRecommendations.    Cabinet are printed in the Appendix.Mammoth Ships. 18. In continuation of War Cabinet 126, Minute 6 (c) (iv),the War Cabinet had a further discussion with regard to thebuilding of additional mammoth ships, and accepted the report ofLord Curzon proposing that one such ship be taken in hand forth-with. The question of building additional ships of this nature upto the number of ten was deferred pending a decision as to theappointment or otherwise of Major-General Sir E. Geddes.Mines. 19. The First Sea Lord brought to the notice of the WarCabinet the question of the lack of mines, and stated that the WarStaff had recommended to his predecessor last spring that the pattern of a new mine should he manufactured, to be an exactcopy of the German mine, and that the then First Sea Lord had given orders for this to be done. Admiral Jellicoe regretted to say,however, that the orders of Sir Henry Jackson were not carried out,but that attempts were made to improve on the German type, with,the result that great delay was incurred in its introduction.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 2, 1917.
