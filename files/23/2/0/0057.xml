The War Cabinet discussed the terms of the letter to be sentto the Nationalist and Ulster parties in connection with the proposed settlement of the Irish Question.Proposed Nitro-cellulose PowderFactory atHenbury.2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinistry of Munitions on the subject of a proposed nitro-cellulosepowder factory at Henbury (Paper G.T.-728) (Appendix), inwhich Dr. Addison sets forth the pros and cons of the question, andinvites the decision of the War Cabinet.Dr. Addison summed up the arguments for and against theconstruction of the factory, having particularly in view the greatlyincreased gun programme which had been put forward by theArmy, and stated that, on balance, he was inclined to advise itsconstruction.
The War Cabinet decided that The factory should not be proceeded with, for the following reasons: (a) The entry of the United States of America on the sideof the Allies, which alters the whole basis on whichthe construction of this factory was sanctioned ;(b.) &apos;i he very large amount of timber required for its con-struction, viz., 33,000 tons;(c.) The amount of labour necessary for its building, viz.,j 5,000 men;(d.) The building could not be finished before March 1918;(e.) The great amount of shipping tonnage involved in theimportation of the requisite raw&apos; materials instead ofthe manufactured propellant, at the rate of 4 tons ofthe former for 1 ton of the latter.Palestine: 3. The First Sea Lord reported a seaplane attack on BeirutSeaplane Attack Harbour, and mentioned that it was thought a store had been on Beirut. demolished.    He stated that no enemy submarines  had been discovered there.Otranto Barrage. 4. The First Sea Lord reported a raid by Austrian naval forces on the Otranto barrage. The enemy had been chased to Cattaro,but the Allied forces had then had to retire on account of theappearance of Austrian battleships. The casualties were : fourteendrifters sunk, a French destroyer mined and sunk, the Britishlight cruiser &quot;&apos; Dartmouth&quot; torpedoed (but by the latest accountsproceeding into harbour), two Italian destroyers disabled. he stated that he had made enquiries as to the forces on each sidewhich had been engaged. As the First Sea Lord thought it probable that the Italians would ask for further assistance, he stated that he had, with the concurrence of Admiral Sims, suggested to the American authorities the question of sending three of theirlight cruisers of the &quot; Birmingham &quot; type to the Adriatic, and that whilst the &quot; Dartmouth &quot; was under repair he had detached the&quot; Newcastle &quot; from the East Indies Station to take her place.The Naval 5. The War Cabinet then proceeded to discuss the largerCommand in the question of the naval command in the Mediterranean, and decidedMediterranean. that The Board of Admiralty should prepare a frank and detailed critical report on the /stem of control in the Medi-terranean, on the basis of which the Prime Minister shouldmake a communication to the Italian Minister of the Interior,who was now in England, after which the appreciation shouldbe forwarded, through the usual channels, for the considerationof the French and Italian Governments.The United States 6.

o3The western front.Russia:Effects of possibleSecession.India.The Italian Front.Salonica.The paris conference,May 3-4, 1917.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that another German Division had been sent from the &quot;Western Front tothe Eastern Front, making three in all, two of these Divisions beingSaxons.8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that in his memorandum on the possible effects of Russia&apos;s secession from thewar (Paper G.T. 678) he had omitted to state that the russians had approximately l  millions of Austrian prisoners and 100,000German prisoners, but that many of them were not of a goodfighting type, though, of course, they could be employed in otherways if set free.9. With reference to War Cabinet 137, Minute 2&apos;, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that the telegrams relative to the trouble on the Indian frontier were of a rather conflicting nature, as some indicated the possibility of our having to take punitive measures, whilst others dealt with defensiveaction only, lie understood that the Secretary of State for india was enquiring into the matter.10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theItalian offensive had made a good start. Their forces hadprogressed considerably, had captured some commanding positions,and had taken 3,000 prisoners.The Prime Minister stated that he was informed by SignorOrlando that the British gunners had received a great ovation atMilan, and that a very good political effect had been produced.It was decided, however, that For the present no public communication should be madecn the subject.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook toascertain whether any reference had yet been made in theItalian press to the arrival of British artillery.11. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported some further progress by the Allied forces both on the Vardar andStruma fronts.12. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention tothe FVench reply to the- proposals made by the British representa-tives at the recent Paris Conference, which, he pointed out,was not of a satisfactory nature, as it contained no allusion to theagreement in regard to the Western Front, and entirely ignoredthe shipping considerations, which were stated at the Conference tobe of paramount importance in regard to the withdrawal of theAllied troops from Salonica.The War Cabinet decided that Although the British proposals in regard to the western front were definitely accepted in Paris, it was desirable thatthe Secretary of State for War, on the occasion of his forth-coming visit to France, should confer with the French Ministerof War on this subject after consultation with the Field-marshal commanding-in-Chief.As regards the shipping considerations in connection withthe withdrawal from Salonica, the War Cabinet noted thatthis matter was dealt with in Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s reply to theFrench note.
Russian LabourConference.EngineeringTrade Strikes.13. With reference to War Cabinet 136, Minute 15, Mr. arthur henderson informed the War Cabinet that at a meeting of the f*Labour Party held this morning it had been decided to take no action relative to British delegates attending the RussianConference until further information has been received from theRussian Socialist Party as to the nature of their proposals.14. With reference to War Cabinet 135, Minute 9, relative tothe strikes on the part of the engineering trade, the War cabinet decided that The Government should adhere to its policy of recognisingonly the constituted authorities of the Trades Unions, and thatno deputation from the shop stewards should be received except at the request of the executive of the Union.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 16, 1917.
APPENDIX.Proposed Nitro-Cellulose Powder Factory at Henbtjry.Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions.THE questions raised since the entry of America into the war as to the necessityof the provision of a nitro-cellulose factory at Henbury, on the Bristol Channel,involve considerations upon which, I think, I should seek the decision of the WarCabinet.The attached minute from Sir Keith Price sets out the case very clearly. Thereis, however, one important consideration which was not before him, and which is verymaterial to the issue. We have now received from the War Office a demand for gunsduring 1918, the magnitude of which will he seen when I place in parallel columnsthe number of guns now available and the number asked to he provided before theend of 1918 to make good wastages and to provide additional batteries.

It is evident also that, with an augmented number of guns, there willhave to be a further addition to the Shell and Ammunition Programme, thoughhappily the provision of ammunition is good for the guns at present in the field. Wemay therefore look during next year to a largely increased demand for nitro-ceilulosepowder, and we may find ourselves confronted with an increased demand for it at theexpense of cordite, if, as anticipations suggest, it is found to cause materially lesscorrosion of the guns. I am advised that it would be possible to forgo the construc-tion of the acid plant for the present, and to derive the acid from the neighbouringfactory at Avonmouth. Short of this, however, whilst fully recognising the demands which it makes upon labour and materials, my own view is that we should proceedwith the erection of the factory up to a 500-ton capacity per week.Another very important consideration which arises is that sometime ago it was arranged, through the Italian Government, that we should send officers to that countryin order to recruit Italian labour, particularly for building and for quarrying. these arrangements have now been completed. Steps have also been taken, with the consentof the French Government, to enlist Italian labourers who are now in France, and itis expected that some thousands will he enrolled, end the necessary arrangements have been made for their transhipment, &amp;c. It was proposed to use Italian labouren bloc at Henbury, and to move the British workmen there to other jobs. It inay bepossible to use these Italians for other purposes, but it must be remembered that theyhave been specially recruited for this kind of work, and it would make our positionvery difficult in future in seeking labour assistance if we were now to say that we didnot want them.C. ADDISON.May 14, 1917.
The Minister.This factory was authorised when the full Gun Ammunition Programme was inforce, was designed to manufacture 1,000 tons of nitro-cellulose powder a week, andwas estimated to cost between 6,000,00(U. and 7,5O0,OO0Z. Early in April, in view ofthe substantial reduction in the programme, it was decided to proceed with thefactory on a basis of producing 500 tons of powder per week, all arrangements beingmade, however, so that the original scheme could be carried out without delay, if required. Since this date, the programme has been further reduced, and the UnitedStates has joined the Allies. . The reduction in the programme represents 1,100 tonsof powder a week, or more than the capacity of the factory, in addition to which very substantial reserves will have accumulated, owing to the large purchases made inAmerica in anticipation of the maximum programme.These contracts with America will expire at the end of October.The question at issue now is whether the factory should be proceeded with or not;the arguments pro and con are roughly as follows: 1. The construction of the factory will employ about 15,000 men, who would beused for other essential work. When producing, the factory will require about 8,000hands, but of these 75 per cent, will be women.2. The abandonment of the work would create a very bad impression locally andprobably politically ; and it would certainly represent a capital loss of at least 750.OOOZ.,perhaps considerably more. In this connection it should be noted that it is probablethat the large new picric acid factory at Avonmouth, which adjoins Henbury, willnot actually be worked, but will he kept as a necessary stand-by. Its output willapparently not be required at present, in view of the reduction in the high explosiveprogramme. It is, therefore, difficult to see how it is possible to avoid very serious criticism if work at Hanbury also is stopped now.3. It is possible the existing ammunition programme may be increased.4. If the factory is completed, and it is found its output is not required, aconsiderable portion of the expenditure will have been wasted. But against this must be set that the power station, any sulphuric-acid plant erected, water supply,and general development of the district will represent good assets, as follows :-(a.) Power station, &amp;c. ; estimated cost, about 750,000/. The Bristol Corporationare alreadv under agreement with the Department as to this, and areprepared to take it over after the war.(b.) Water supply; estimated cost, about 600,000/. Water is scarce in thedistrict, and, with new industries starting up, it is believed this expendi-ture can ultimately be recouped. The Bristol Corporation would probablybe prepared to take this over also.(c.) The site is an excellent one and should be very valuable when developed.There will he excellent railway facilities, water power, and deep-waterdocks within a few miles.   Coal is cheap and labour is fairly abundant.5. The United States of America being now an Ally and exchange difficulties beingeasier, it can be argued that we had better purchase powder there rather than uselabour, material, and plant to erect a factory which will scarcely be producing thisyear. On the other hand, it is possible that the United States, being now a belligerent,may have no pow-der to spare when it is wanted, although, if really required, theycould erect factories, probably quicker than is possible here.6. There is no nitro-cellulose factory at present in the kingdom (Messrs. Nobelare erecting a small one 150 tons weekly at Irvine), and in view of the opinionheld in many quarters as to the advantage of this powder, especially from the point ofits small corrosion of guns, it would appear that a Government factory on a large scale would he a very useful asset to the country.7. There will he difficulty in obtaining sufficient alcohol to run the factory unless we trench on our whiskey resources : this would be very expensive.8. The main argument in favour of abandoning the construction of the factoryaltogether is the saving of tonnage involved by purchasing in the United States of Americainstead of importing raw materials and working them up here. One ton of nitro-cellulose powder represents 4i tons of raw material. The raw materials used are mainly cotton, sulphur or pyrites,.and nitrate of soda. Of these materials, cotton is,of course, produced in the United States of America. -Although at the present timeAmerica imports a certain quantity of pyrites, there is sulphur available, if necessary,
in the country, and any new sulphuric-acid plants required could be adapted to burnthis material.V v Nitrate of soda from Chile has to be imported into either country, but thepassage to United States ports, whether on the east or west coast, is shorter and, ofcourse, much safer than the passage to this country. Thus the saving in tonnage bypurchasing nitro-cellulose in the United States of America on a 500-ton per weekbasis would probably he between 800 and 1,200 tons per week.9. Tonnage difficulties may possibly cause a shortage of glycerine, which might affect the production of cordite. One ton of glycerine represents 30 tons of imported materials, and a ton of cordite contains between T33 and &quot;184 tons of glycerine.A shortage of cordite would mean an increased demand for nitro-cellulose powder. Original estimate, say     ,. .. .. .. .. .. ..    7,000,000Deduct for reduction in capacity to 500 tons with power and water for 1,000 tons,and elimination of Grillo sulphuric-acid units     .. .. ,-. ..    1,500,0005,500,000K. W. PRICE.Owing to the reduction of the Avonmouth factory for picric acid, there will besufficient surplus acid produced there to run Henbury on the 500-ton basis. It is not proposed, therefore, to erect any acid units at Henbury for the present.
