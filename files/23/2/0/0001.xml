-1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegramfrom the General Officer Commanding the MesopotamianExpeditionary Force reporting further captures of prisoners andbooty, and a general demoralisation of the enemy forces. The tele-gram further stated that some re-organisation would be required before a fresh advance could be made.He also read a letter of congratulation from General Nivelle.2. The First Sea Lord, reported much aerial activity in the adriatic.3. The First Sea Lord reported that two of the transports andthe destroyer reported ashore near Havre (War -Cabinet, 82,Minute C) were again afloat. He believed that three were stillashore.4. The Prime Minister stated that he had received informa-tion to the effect that at the time the &quot; Laconia &quot; was torpedoedshe was: only steaming; at- 9 knots.The First Sea Lord stated there would be a full inquiry, andthat,i if necessary, disciplinary action-would be taken.5. Signor Bissokti, a Member of the Italian Cabinet, accom-panied by Prince Teano, explained to the War Cabinet, on a map,the apprehensions of the Italian Government, which, he stated, were based on ..- information believed \ to be reliable.: that the, Austrians,supported by large German and perhaps Bulgarian forces, would.iattack from - the direction of the Trentino with the object, of cutting off, .:and severing the communications of, the bulk .of the ItalianArmies disposed on the Car so, Isonzo, and other fronts to the-east of the Trentino.   Signor Bissolati stated that, in the, opinion of the-Italian General Staff, such an-attack would hardly commence beforethe middle of May, owing to the severity of the winter and. theunusual snowfall in. the mountains.The Director of Military Intelligence reported that there .wasno information at present of any enemy concentration, but therewere indications of preparations for some such concentration in the!Trentino, though whether by Austrians or Germans he could not atpresent judge.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the questionof the Italian defence was part of the general strategical -problem which confronted the Allies ; roughly, the general plan was that each Ally should be able to defend his own front,.and be given such assistance as he might need by offensive action on other Alliedfronts. To move troops about from one front to another fordefensive purposes was unsound in many ways, and w-as to be strongly deprecated. He considered that a definite plan ought to bein existence to meet the contingency apprehended by Signor Bissolati,and he understood that some arrangements had already been con-certecl with General. Nivelle. . Sir William Robertson hoped to visitGeneral Cadorna in the near future, and the chief object of his visit was to ascertain if arrangements had been made and what morerem aiined to be don e.The War Cabinet impressed on the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Stall the importance of: providing against a repetition in italy of the Roumanian debacle, particularly in. view of the fact thatthe Italians1 are believed to rely on this country more than on France.In this connection they take note that support to the Italians doesnot depend upon shipping, and that, according to a statement madeby Signor Bissolati to the Prime Minister, the Italian reverses in theTrentino last year were due to an insufficiency of heavy.artillery.
The Chief of -the Imperial &quot;General Staff replied that &apos;thef &apos;responsibility for the safety of Italy could not Lbe accepted !bydrimalone, as the whole plan of campaign for&apos;the year was drawn up by representatives of the Allies in-Conference, and that British actionindependent of the French in particular was impossible, especially as we-now stood fully committed-to place the whole of our forces onff p ythe Western front under-the orders of-&apos;the Fivmch Oommander-in-Mj^naw^ *^^w^3hief.^FIe added that although the-movement of troops to support0 /      -Italy was. not affected by shipping it was affected by the amount of rolling-stock available,.and at present this-is very deficient.Offensive.iThe-Eeport of theDardanellesCommission.G-. Signor rBissolati -also raised the question of an offensive by, the Allies on the Italian , front, dwelling more particularly on thepolitical ^advantages of such an operation.    He also insisted onthe ! political importance* of British and Italian troops fighting side by side, in which theiPrime Minister concurred.The military aspects of this question were left for discussion between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff  and general cadorna, but it was recognised that no decision relating to action-would be taken without conference between the three Governmentsconcerned.7. (The Secretary reported that he had .just received a com-inunication from Colonel Swinton, stating that the President of theDardanelles Commission had informed him that the commission had. considered that * morning the question of amending their first report on principle, without studying the actual excisions suggestedby the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the War Office, and were agreed that, whatever amendments the Government&apos;might decide- to .-introduce for Diplomatic, Naval, or Military reasons before the; Report was published, they were not prepared themselves to admitany alteration into their Report.The War Cabinet were generally of opinion that, in certain cases where foreign countries were involved, it was not . in . thenational interest that particular passages in the Report should,.bemade public, e.g., the reference to our Intelligence Service in constantinople.The War Cabinet decided themselves to take the responsibility. for any excisions made in the national interest.They further decided that complete and unexpurgatedcopies of the Report should be furnished to the speaker of the House of Commons, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Redmond,and Mr. Wardle, and that a statement to this effect shouldbe made in Parliament at the, first convenient opportunity.Detention of&quot;Neutral shipping in the UnitedKingdom.8. With reference to the decision of the War Cabinet at theprevious Meeting (War Cabinet, 82, Minute 19), the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs reported that he had seen the UnitedStates Ambassador, who was of opinion that the American public would not take much interest in the requisitioning of Danish ships by the British Government.&apos; The Ambassador had suggested that ;he should send a private and unofficial telegram to , the President of the United Statesexplaining the whole situation. The War Cabinet agreed that thiswas a wise course, and decided that  Lord Robert Cecil should write an aide-memoire, which shouldbe furnished to Mr. Page, to enable him to lay all the factsbefore the President.
Salonica: 9. The War Cabinet had before them comnrunicatioiis whichPort Facilities. had passed between the Admiralty and Salonica (Appendix I),indicating that, in spite of the strong representations made to theFrench Government by direction of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet,48, Minute 13), General Sarrail cannot accede to the request of theBritish Government for the use of the desired sheds on the BritishQuay at Salonica. Mr. Palmer, who had lately returned from Salonica, stated that the special reason for the British demand wasto obtain not so much the actual covered space in the shed as access to certain lines of railway in rear of the shed, which could not bedone without rising the shed and depriving the Greeks of its use.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War, in concert with the Fourth sea lord, should draft a telegram on the subject to Lord Bertie,and that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should see M. Cambon and point out to him the urgent necessityof our obtaining the use of the Custom House sheds.Grain for Horses. 10. With reference to Minute 13 of War Cabinet, 77, the WarCabinet had before them a report by Sir Henry Babington Smith(Appendix II).The War Cabinet approved the suggestion contained inparagraph 5 of the Report in regard to an interdepartmental committee, and decided that The President of the Board of Trade should convene an Inter-departmental Committee composed of representatives ofthe War Office, the Local Government Board, the Boardof Trade, the Ministry of Food, and the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries, to consider economies in the use of grainfor horses and to direct the census of horses.restriction of 11. The War Cabinet authorised the President of the Board ofImports. Trade to proceed to Paris to discuss the question of the restriction of Imports with M. Clementel, and to negotiate and, if possible,come to an agreement within the limits allowed by the previousdecisions of the War Cabinet.   The War Cabinet decided that Any important questions arising out of the negotiations withour Allies, or with the Dominions or India, on the subjectof the Restriction of Imports, should, if they cannot bedealt with by the Committee which it was decided to setup on&apos; the previous clay (War Cabinet, 82, Minute 11), bediscussed in the first instance with Lord Curzon.Coal for France. 12. The   War   Cabinet take note  of the  Prime Minister&apos;aConference with representatives of the French Government held at10, Downing Street, on the 22nd February, 1917, in regard to thesupply of coal to France (Appendix III).(Initialled) D.

APPENDIX I.Use of the English Quay at Salonica.(M. 01926.)THE Secretary of the Admiralty presents his compliments to Colonel Hankey,.and begs to call attention to the enclosed copies of telegrams which have been exchanged between the Admiralty and the Transport Officer at Salonica, with referenceto the use of the English Quay at Salonica by the British Army. The telegram to theTransport Officer was sent in accordance with information communicated by His&apos;Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, in his telegram No. 113 of the 15th instant.It will be seen that the unrestricted facilities, which are considered necessary forthe British Army, have not been granted by General Sarrail, and in these circumstances it appears necessary for the matter to be again submitted to the War Cabinet in orderthat further representations may be made to the French Government, with a view tothe recommendations of the Transport Officer being carried out.The Quartermaster-General concurs with their Lordships in the matter being brought again before the War Cabinet as one of immediate and urgent importance.(Initialled) W. G. G.Admiralty, February 22, 1917.(Copy of Telegram)From Admiralty to Transports, Salonica, February 18, 1917.Urgent.   694.   Your 815. - Secret.General Sarrail has informed French Government that portion of quay reservedfor British Army is not so far encumbered with goods for civil population and thatEnglish base has therefore all facilities for discharging on quay. He further states:that if British authorities request refers to eventual occupation of central building of greek Custom House, which is specially fitted up and constitutes vital organ of GreekCustom House Administration, he caunot accede thereto, pointing out that two buildingson quay taken from Greek Custom House were ceded to British on the 30th December.Latter has therefore 3,000 square metres covered sheds as compared with 1,444 squaremetres at disposal of French Army, whose burdens are double. Request immediatereport on present position.(Decypher of Telegram.)From Transports, Salonica, to Admiralty, February 20, 1917.886.   Secret,   Your 69-1.It is increased transit facilities that are required on quays, Our landing facilities are hampered, clue to want of increased transit facilities, and these can only be obtained by taking over Custom House.Army Headquarters conferred with Minister of Finance to Provisional Governmentand he held out no objection if he could receive additional landing facilities on Greekquays, which could be arranged.Statements of areas of covered sheds are incorrect and should be : English 2,790square metres, French 4,000 square metres, not including old custom buildings of3,000 square metres situated close to their quays.With reference to increased transit facilities and their importance, please askSir Francis Dent.
gAPPENDIX II.Consumption of Gkain by Horses.Report by Sir H. Babington Smith (see War Cabinet, 77, Minute 13).1. THE number of horses and mules employed by the Army (31st January, 1917)and the amount of grain required for them are as follows : Oats (or other Grainper Month).United KingdomFranceSalonicaEgyptMesopotamia   ..TotalNumber.148,000419.000--  567,000106,00059,00077,000---   242,000809,000Tons.25,00081,000106,00018,00016,00012,000---    46,000152,000*Or 1,824,000 tons per annum.The weight of grain required for military horses in the United Kingdom andFrance alone would supply a population of 14,000,000 with wheat on Food Controller^scale. The horses in iSalonica, Egypt, and Mesopotamia are now being supplied withgrain from India ; barley, grain, &amp;c, being substituted for oats. The oats for Franceare imported direct from America. The horses in France require also 70,000 tons ofhay per month (840,000 tons per annum). This is bought in the United Kingdom andshipped to France.2. North America is the largest source of supply for horses and mules, themunbers imported in 1916 from North America and Australasia being as follows : From U.S.A. and Canada to United KingdomEgypt   ..,, ,,        Saloiiica . .From Austialia and New Zealand to Egypt75,66021,86628,141125,66796,000In addition, 3,000 horses per month were bought in the United Kingdom, this being, in the opinion of the Director of Remounts, the largest number that can beobtained by voluntary purchase.The cost of the American animals landed in England is 10-25 per cent, higherthan the maximum price paid in the United Kingdom.3. The number of horses in the United Kingdom is not known, even approximately.The horses on agricultural holdings in 1916 numbered about 2,100,000. Theother horses are probably more numerous. They were estimated in 1905 .to amountto 4,500,000 ; but the number has, no doubt, decreased since then.It is estimated that each horse cousumes on the average to I-J tons of grainper annum (7g- to 9 lb. per diem) the military ration being 13 lb. If the totalnumber of horses does not exceed 4,000,000, this would give a grain consumption of5-6,000,000 tons per annum.4. The questions which require special consideration appear to be : (a.) Reduction in the number of horses in civil use, by combined deliveries,reduction of pleasure horses, &amp;c.(b.) Increased purchases of military horses in the United Kingdom, by absorption of horses set free under (a), or in consequence of the reduction of industries such as brewing ; by raised price; or by requisition,(c.) Reduction in the number of military horses.   This question has recently been before the War Cabinet.   It can only be dealt with effectively by themilitary authorities, under instruction from the War Cabinet.
(d.) The possibility of rationing horses, and of prohibiting the use of grain forpleasure horses.(e.) The possibility, in the last resort, of extending the use of horse-meat, thuseconomising imports both of meat and of grain.(/.) A census of horses.A census is required in order to deal fully with several of the above questions.The census could probably best be taken, under the Registrar-General, by the police in country districts, and by the local authorities, with the assistance of the police in the boroughs. The methods to be adopted in Scotland and Ireland will require consideration.5. The Departments chiefly affected are : War Office.Ministry of Food.Ministry of Agriculture.Local Government Board.Board of Trade.A committee of representatives of these Departments appears to offer the most convenient means of dealing with these questions. The. committee should call inrepresentatives of the Departments concerned in Scotland and Ireland so far as necessary, and should confer with the Registrar-General as to the census.(Signed) H. BABINGTON SMITH.February 27, 1917.APPENDIX III.Note of the Conclusions of a Meeting between the Prime Minister and Representativesof the French Government, held at 10, Downing Street on Thursdaij, February 22,1917, at 3 p.m.*THE Prime Minister pointed out to the French representatives that no shipping-could be provided immediately to relieve the coal situation in France. He suggestedthat, in view of the great accxxmulations of munitions, some temporary restrictionsmight be imposed on their output in order to make coal available for the railways. Itwas indicated that, if Parliament approves the restriction of imports, some further assistance might be possible later, and that some alleviation of the situation might be gradually obtained as tonnage hitherto employed in distant seas was brought to home waters.The French representatives undertook to submit, for the favourable considerationof their Government, a proposal that greater facilities should be given to the british army for felling timber behind the lines of the British Army in France.Sir Maurice Hankey was directed to furnish them with a brief Memorandum onthis subject.   (Attached.)The French representatives stated that M. Guernier had been nominated as therepresentative of the French Government on the Inter-Ally Shipping Bureau.The French representatives stated that it was the intention of the FrenchGovernment to imitate the example of the British Government in farther restrictionsof imports, and they insisted on the importance of close co-operation between the twoGovernments in this matter. They stated that the services of M. Guernier would beavailable in this direction, and they indicated that further liaison arrangements mightbe desirable.The French representatives asked if miners could be supplied by the BritishGovernment for working some of the disused French mines, and, in reply, the PrimeMinister explained the difficulties of our own man-power situation, which prevented usirom complying with this request.* This is a summary of a full proces-verbal, copies of which can be furnished if required.
Timber.In order to release tonnage and relieve the congested condition of the French ports and railways it is proposed to meet the timber requirements of the British Armyin France by felling timber in that country. The requirements of the British Armyduring 1917 are estimated at 1,650,000 tons. In order to meet this demand it will benecessary to supply labour and plant. The newly appointed Director of timber supplies, War Office, has this matter in hand. Further, it will be necessary to obtain permission from the French Government for the clear felling of woods within the warzone.At present the French Government have given permission for felling the woodsround Rouen. This source of supply is obviously better than obtaining the timber from overseas, but there is still the difficulty of rail haulage from Rouen to the front.It is, therefore, suggested that the French Government should be asked to give instructions that every facility should be given to the British Army for clear fellingwoods in the immediate vicinity of the line, and, further, that the French forestry rules,with regards to removing stumps and generally clearing up, should be waived until after the war.Vessels carrying Timber to France.(a.) There are at present 46 vessels carrying timber to France for the BritishGovernment; of these 15 are neutral ships from Scandinavia. Their gross tonnage is115,039 tons, and they deliver between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of timber per month inFrance.(b.) In addition, there are 10 transports, total gross tonnage 44,553 tons,conveying timber to France for the French Government. They deliver about 23,000tons of timber per month.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 23, 1917.o
