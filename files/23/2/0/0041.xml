Palestine. 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that atelegram had been received from General Murray to the effect thatan attack had been commenced outside Gaza, that the fighting hadbeen heavy and continuous, and that a gain of from one to twothousand yards had been made.Mesopotamia.   , 2. The Chief of. the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that General Maude, who had divided the Turkish Forcesinto two parts, one on the Diala and the other on the Tigris, had attacked on the 18th April on the Tigris with the result that about1,250 prisoners, of whom 60 were wounded, had been taken, andthat more were coming in. The composite Cavalry Brigade had done good work.   Cur total casualties had amounted to only 73.Fron7eStern 3- The Chief of the ^Pe^1 General Staff reported that therewas no fresh news with regard to the French operations, but thatGeneral Nivelle&apos;s progress had been, on the whole, not unsatisfactory,so far as he could judge, but information was scanty. general maurice, Director of Military Operations, had gone to France inorder to obtain fuller details.Hospital Ships. 4 With reference to War Cabinet 122, Minute 9, the First sea lord made a further statement in regard to the loss of life in the sinking of the &quot; Arcadian,&quot; &quot; Donegal,&quot; and &quot; Lanfranc.&quot;The War Cabinet discussed the question of making the most effective statement possible in the Press in regard to the sinking ofthese ships, and decided That the Admiralty should prepare a statement which shouldbe submitted to Lord Curzon on Saturday and published on Monday, the 23rd April.&apos; off Earn?eatelaneS 5l The First Sea Lord rePorted tiiat two enemy seaplanes wereoff Ramsgate on the previous day. One of them fired a torpedo atone of our monitors. This was the first occasion on which theGermans had carried out this particular form of attack. No damagehad been done.Hostile seaplanes carrying torpedoes had also attacked theNorth Goodwin Drifter Division, but here again no damage hadbeen done.Mine-laying. 6. The First Sea Lord stated that our mines which had been laid in the North Sea were, to judge from results, not provingeffective, . The new order for 100,000 mines (War Cabinet 46,Minute 7) would not be ready for delivery before next June.The First Sea Lord urged the necessity of having a larger number of mine-layers, and it was suggested that possibly theUnited States Government might be able to render some assistancein this direction.   The War Cabinet therefore decided that The First Sea Lord should telegraph to Admiral de Chairasking him, in the first place, to find out how manysuitable vessels there were in the United States that couldbe utilised for this purpose.
Submarines.7. In view of the serious statements made by the First sea lord in regard to the ineffectiveness of - our attack upon the submarines, and the increasing number of vessels sunk, the WarCabinet discussed at some length the whole situation caused by thesubmarine menace, including the possibility of having to abandon the Salonica operations in order to release mercantile shipping.The War Cabinet felt that there should be a weekly review ofthe facts as to shipping, food, raw materials, &amp;c, and that thequestion of how best such an examination should be conductedshould be raised immediately after the Prime Ministers return.Questions in theHouses of Parlia-ment in regard toSubmarines.S. Lord Curzon stated that the question of the submarinemenace was to be raised by Lord Beresford in the House of Lordsnext week, and asked what reply should be given by the Govern-ment.   The War Cabinet decided that Lord Beresfords questions on this subject should be answeredby the representative of the Admiralty in the House ofLords in a brief, official reply.Hospital Ships: 9. With reference to War Cabinet 122, -Minute 16, the FirstReprisals. Sea Lord reported that the French Government had agreed to carryout future reprisals, when required, in retaliation for destruction of hospital ships.  &quot;The War Cabinet decided that  The French Government should now be asked by the admiralty to make another raid upon an unfortified German town, onaccount of the sinking of the &quot; Gloucester Castle &quot; ; andthat future reprisals of this nature should be carried outentirely by the French, having regard to the necessity of withdrawing the British Naval Air Pilots for other work,the British Governmentcase.being previously notified in eachTonnage for theRussian WhiteSea.10. The First Sea Lord asked the War Cabinet for a decision as to sending steamers to Archangel. It was pointed out that a paper on this subject was being circulated by the Shipping controller and would shortly be in the hands of members of the War Cabinet.In the meantime the War Cabinet decided that Tonnage for the Russian Programme should be postponed asmuch as possible without calling attention to the delay.Hospitals at salonica.11. With reference to War Cabinet 122, Minute 1.2, theSecretary of State for War reported that he had been informedthat it was not practicable to have a sanatorium at Mount Athos,having regard to the difficulty of getting the sick and woundedthere. &apos;In view of the danger to hospital ships in the Mediterranean,the probable increase of malaria, and the necessity for having a hospital on the mainland, the War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to telegraph to Salonicaexplaining to General Milne that it is essential thathospitals should be provided on the mainland, and asking him to send an expert medical officer to examine thepossibilities of such accommodation, and report.
Hospitals in.France.12. -With, reference to War Cabinet 122, Minute 11, in regard,to the lack of doctors, the War Cabinet had before them a memorandum-randum by Sir Alfred Keogh suggesting certain steps to be taken tocarry out the War Cabinet&apos;s instructions with regard to tbe provi-sion of more hospitals abroad (Paper G.T.-491, Appendix I).Representatives of the National Health Insurance Commissionand the Local Government Board pointed oat to the War Cabinetthat, if every civilian medical practitioner under 41 and fit for service abroad were called up,-certain areas would be dangerouslydenuded, and in shipbuilding, munition, and colliery districts there might be serious trouble.Sir Robert Morant stated that already there had been aconsiderable agitation as a result of the announcement&quot; that allpractitioners under 41 were to-be called up. There had been acertain amount of misunderstanding in the matter. Some doctorsthought that they would be called up as private soldiers, othersthat their privileges of appeal to the Tribunals had been abrogated.He also explained that it would be necessary to urge the practi-practitioners over 41 to go, as an act of patriotism, and do the work athome of the doctors under 41 who would be called up.The War Cabinet decided that The War Office, in consultation with the Local GovernmentBoard and the National Health Insurance Commission,should prepare a statement for the press, to be issued thefollowing morning, stating the facts as clearly and tactfullyas possible, in order to prevent misunderstanding amongthe doctors and trouble in Parliament.Trade UnionAmalgamation Bill.13. The War Cabinet had under consideration the draft of a Billto amend Section 12 of the Trade Union Act (Amendment Act), 1876,with respect to the amalgamation of trade unions (Paper G.T.-505,Appendix II).The War Cabinet decided To sanction the introduction of this Bill.Flying equipment of the Eoyal FlyingCorps in France.14. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the AirBoard on this subject (Paper G.T.-476, Appendix III).The War Cabinet decided that A copy of this letter should be sent by the Secretary of Statefor War to Sir Douglas Haig for his information.(Initialled)A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W,.21st April, 1917.
G.T.-491.APPENDIX IIncreased Provision of Hospital Accommodation Abroad.&apos;THE accompanying memorandum by Sir Alfred Keogh suggests the necessary steps to be taken to carry out the War Cabinets instruction with regard to theprovision of more hospitals abroad.DERBY.April ,18, 1917.Assuming that there can be no further evacuation of sick and wounded fromthe Mediterranean, or between the various Mediterranean stations Egypt, Salonica,and Malta it will be necessary to establish, close to Salonica, Hospitals andConvalescent Camps for 50,000 men. Of this accommodation, 30,000 should be for hospital patients. It is morally certain that this wiU have to be increased later on,and possibly doubled. Thirty General Hospitals of 1,040 beds each will require thefollowing personnel: 750 Officers, at 25 per General Hospital.3,000 Nursing Service, of which half V.A.D.&apos;s, i.e., 50 trained and 50 V.A.D.nurses.6,000 &quot; Other Ranks.&quot;If it is quite certain that there will be no evacuation from either Egypt or Salonicato Malta, then we could withdraw from Malta 10,000 beds. This is on the assumptionthat there are 18,000 hospital beds there, and ignores convalescent accommodation,which can be made self-supporting.This would release : 100 Officers.300 Nursing Service, of whom half V.A.D.&apos;s.1,000 &quot;Other Ranks.&quot;Assuming that the Admiralty can bring from Boulogne and Calais to Dover everyday 4,500 sick and wounded, and will continue to do this without any remission, thereneed be no accession to the strength of the Medical Service in France indeed, itmight be possible to reduce there. Reductions can be made if the Americans sendhospitals ; but for the moment this is left out of consideration.The remaining personnel to be provided for Salonica is therefore :  650 Officers.2,700 Nursing Service.15,000 &quot; Other Ranks.&quot;&quot;Egypt must similarly be provided for, and an addition of 10,000 beds there mustbe contemplated.This will require : 250 Medical Officers.1,000 Nurses.2,000    Other Ranks.&quot;Grand Total :900 Medical Officers.3,700 Nurses.7,000 &quot;Other hanks&quot;To this grand total must be added demands for other theatres, which might bereduced to 150 medical officers, having regard to (4) below.To do this it may be necessary : (1.) To order abroad forthwith every R.A.M.C. officer, permanent and temporary,fit for service.abroad.
(2.) To close certain military hospitals at home and abroad.(3.) To call up every civil medical practitioner under 41 and fit for service abroad.(4.) To retain in the service all temporary commissioned officers throughout theworld of military age.(5.) Shoidd it become necessary to provide more room in England for sick and wounded from France, when some military hospitals are closed, to requisition largecivil hospitals for sick and wounded irrespective of civil needs.(6.) To enable the personnel to be obtained from the civil profession, no oppositionmust be made by the National Health Insurance Commissioners, by the Local Govern-ment Board, or by the Board of Education, on account of any civil needs whatsoever.(7.) To obtain nurses it will be necessary to denude the hospitals, civil andmilitary, at home to the extent required regardless of consequences, closing up suchhospitals as may render this necessary without undue hardship upon patients.(8.) To provide such numbers of additional recruits for the R.A.MG. as may benecessary, after every possible man who can be replaced by a woman has been removed from military hospitals at home and in France.(9.) To recall from British hospitals abroad all nurses and V.A.D.&apos;s now workingwith our -Allies.(10.) To take power to transfer all medical men holding combatant commissions tothe R.A.M.C.(Signed) A. KEOGH, D.G.April 18, 1917.APPENDIX II.Draft of a Bill to Amend Section 12 of the Trade Union Act Amendment Act, 1876,with respect to the Amalgamation of Trade Unions.BE it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows : 1. Any two or more trades unions may by the consent of a majority of the membersof each or every such trade union voting on the question become amalgamated together as one trade union ; and, accordingly, section 12 of the Trades Unions Act Amend-ment Act, 1876, shall have effect as if for the words &quot; by the consent of not less than two-thirds of the members of each or every such trade union &quot; there were substituted the words &quot; by the consent of a majority of the members of each or every such tradeunion voting on the question.&quot;2. This Act may be cited as the Trade Union (Amalgamation) Act, 1917.APPENDIX III.G.T.-476. -Sir, Air Board, April 17, 1917.I AM directed by the President of the Air Board to acknowledge the receipt ofyour letter of the 16th instant, forwarding copy of a communication from Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig with reference to the Air Service. This has been laid before the AirBoard, and I am to offer the following observations with regard to it for the informationof the War Cabinet : Sir Douglas Haig states that &quot; the difficulties to be overcome were increased by thenumber of out-of-date machines, and new type machines came too late for pilots tobecome accustomed to them.&quot;The Board believe the above statement to be substantially correct, except that whilethe new type machines sent out to France to be substituted in the equipment of squadrons already there for machines of an older type, no doubt reached France at alater date than was desirable for the purposes of the Offensive now in progress, the&apos; new Squadrons which proceeded from this country had been adequately trained in therise of their machines before leaving for France.
The problem of the production of new types of aircraft is one of such complexitythat it can only be stated here in broad outline.The root difficulty to be overcome is that the production of engines of the increasedpower required by the constant developments of aviation. It cannot be too clearlyappreciated, for the purpose of understanding the present situation, that with theexception of the Rolls-Royce engine, and in a lesser degree of the Beardmore engine,it is only to-day that we are reaching the stage of the production in substantial quantities of an engine, suitable for fighter and fighter-reconnaissance aeroplanes, ofBritish design and manufacture. Apart from these two engines, of which more will besaid below, the Royal Flying Corps have hitherto been dependent for the class of aircraft in question upon French engines. As regards these, although the FrenchGovernment have given great assistance and large contracts have been placed inFrance, the supplies for this country have necessarily been subordinated to someextent to the req uirements of the French Government. As a result, the numbers -available for British aircraft have been far smaller than could be desired, while thetrials necessary for adapting new designs of aeroplanes to them have met with difficulties and delays which would not have occurred had the engines been of Britishorigin.Reference has been made above to the Rolls-Royce and Beardmore engines. Theformer is a very efficient engine. Technical considerations, however, and the peculiarcharacteristics of the proprietary firm, have hitherto presented insurmountabledifficulties to its production in the numbers required. Owing, moreover, to thesystem by which engines were, until recently, manufactured separately for naval andmilitary aircraft, only a proportion of these engines was, by the favour of theAdmiralty, allotted to the Royal Flying Corps. This proportion, though generouslyincreased by the Admiralty, was small in relation to the requirements of the R.F.C. inthe field.The Beardmore engine has only recently been developed to. a power (160 h.p.)which renders its performance adequate to the requirements of the present day. this development has been accompanied by difficulties of a technical character, which againhave hitherto limited its output.As a result of these causes, supplemented by the difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies of raw material and labour under the regime then in force, the development of aircraft during last summer and autumn, suited to meet the needs of the presentcampaign, was retarded, and the forecast given to General Trenchard last Septemberhas, as stated in the letter of the 24th February, 1917, from the Secretary to the WarOffice to the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief (of which a copy was enclosed in myletter to you of the 1st March), been delayed about one month. It should be borne inmind in this connection that an interval of many months must elapse between the timewhen the requirements which a new type of aeroplane has to fulfil are specified and themoment when that type reaches the manufacturing stage.The Air Board in its reorganised form was appointed at the beginning of this year,and has been gradually taking over the functions hitherto exercised by the AeronauticalSupply Departments of the Admiralty and War Office. I am to state that Mr. PercyMartin and Sir William Weir, the new Controllers of Petrol Engines and AeronauticalSupplies, report that, on taking over their new duties, they found that the directorate of Aircraft Equipment, which was previously charged with the duty of furnishingaircraft to the Royal Flying Corps, had,- in the face of great difficulties, worked withextreme energy, and that, having regard to the conditions prevailing, the results achieved are extremely good. It should be realised, however, how unfavourable those conditions have been. The President is informed by Sir David Henderson that he lost no opportunity of impressing upon the Government in the early part of last year that thesystem by which the Admiralty and the War Office were severally responsible for thesupply of the material to the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps wasdetrimental to the public interest, inasmuch as it provided no means of applying theresources of the country in the proportion of the real requirements of the two services.The Government recognised the force of his contentions by appointing the Joint WarAir Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Derby, but neither this nor the AirBoard under the Presidency of Lord Curzon, which succeeded it, had the powersnecessary to organise the supply of aircraft on a common basis, nor to secure thenecessary degree of priority for the Flying Service as regards raw material andlabour.These conditions prevailed during the crucial months of last summerl when thesituation of which complaint is now made had its genesis.
Although the considerations in regard to engine supply which have been set forth above could no doubt not have been altogether overcome by any change of organisation,yet the experience of the Air Board, since its reconstitution last January, tends to&apos;show that a substantial improvement might have been brought about had the problemof supply been dealt with earlier, and the requisite degree of priority secured foraeronautical supplies.The following figures showing the ratio of past deliveries of engines to presentand guaranteed future deliveries are eloquent in this respect : If the average monthly deliveries of engines for 1916 be taken as a standard figure of      ... ... ... ...       8Then the average actual deliveries for January and February1917 would be represented by ... ... ...     16The guaranteed deliveries for the period 1st March, to 30thJune, 1917, by    ... ... ... ... ...     .19And the guaranteed deliveries for the period  1st July to31st October, 1917, by the figure ... ...     29It is only light to add that the way for the improvement now in prospect was in alarge measures prepared by the untiring efforts of the Directorate of aircraft equipment, which has now ceased to exist.There can thus be no question but that the supply of aircraft to the ExpeditionaryForce will steadily and materially improve during the remaining months of the year.There have already been sent to the front since 1st January machines of new typeamounting to an addition of seven squadrons, each involving provision of someeighty engines, and, further, three and a half squadrons already at the front havebeen equipped with new aeroplanes and engines. This process will be continued as rapidly as the manufacturing and transport conditions now prevailing will permit.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) H. P. HARVEY.APPENDIX IIIa.(The following letter was not received until after the meeting of the War Cabinet, atwhich Appendix III was discussed.)Sir, Air Board Office, Strand, W.C., April 20, 1917.I AM directed by the President of the Air Board to refer to my letter of the17th instant relating to a communication from Sir D. Haig in regard to the supplyof aircraft to the British Expeditionary Force, and to state that, by error, reference ismade therein to the opinion and experience of the Air Board as a whole.The letter was written after the President had heard the views of the Board on sir D. Haig&apos;s telegram, but, in consequence of the desire expressed by you that the reply should, if possible, xeach the AVar Cabinet by the evening of the 17th instant,was not circulated and considered in draft by the Members of the Board.The letter should be taken accordingly as conveying the opinion of the Presidentof the Air Board.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) H.
