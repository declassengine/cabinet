What was required was an exchange of views as tothe nature of the co-operation of the United States of America.In this connection a telegram was read from Mr. PomeroyBurton to Lord Northcliffe, laying stress on the importance of theearly despatch of experts in war organisation of all kinds to confer with American experts.The War Cabinet considered that it was of great importance that, in order to initiate the expert negotiations, someone of thehighest status in this country, who was known to the american people, and who would have the entree to all circles, should proceedto Washington.Mr. Balfour undertook to inform Mr. Page in the afternoon.Subject to a favourable reply from the United States Govern-ment before the actual departure, the War Cabinet decided that .
