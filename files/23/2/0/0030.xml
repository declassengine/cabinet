The organisation ofthe medical pro-fession for war and civilian services.2. Tlie War Cabinet decided that The question of the Organisation of the Medical Professionfor War and Civilian Services, raised in the Ninth Reportof the Director-General of National Service to the WarCabinet, should be referred, in the first instance, to lord milner and Mr. Henderson, who should examine thequestion as part of their enquiry into the scheme ofNational Service (War Cabinet, 109, Minute 1), in con-sultation with : Lord Rliondda9Mr, Munro,Sir E. Cornwall,Representatives of the Admiralty and War Office,and should report as to the necessary legislation.Cotton.3. The War Cabinet had a short discussion with the Presidentof the Board of Trade on the subject of the cotton situation.The Paris EconomicConference.4. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on thesubject of the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference, and considerable doubts were expressed in regard to their expediency.It was pointed out that they provided the German Governmentwith a powerful lever for stiffening the resistance of the Germanpeople. Attention was drawn to their probable effect on the posthelium economic situation of those parts of the United Kingdomwhieh before the War were largely dependent on German markets(e.g., Yorkshire for wool, and the North-East of England and theEast Coast of Scotland for coal), and to their injurious effect onschemes of Imperial trade development.It was decided that-These resolutions should be discussed at the War Cabinet priorto their consideration at the Imperial War Cabinet.The United Statesof America and shipping.6. The War Cabinet authorised The Shipping Controller to communicate to Mr. Sparks, his representative in the United States of America, instructionsto- guide him in his negotiations with the Government ofthe United States. In these instructions Sir JosephMaclay was authorised to include a direction that heshould inform the Government of the United States that,owing to the shortage of shipping, we should have greatdifficulty in supplying shipping for the conveyance ofcotton to this country. He should therefore endeavour tosecure that the United States of America should assist by sending their own produce, and particularly cotton, intheir own ships.Milk prices.6, With reference to War Cabinet, 99, Minute 19 (v), the WarCabinet approved: The raising of the price of milk during the winter of 1917-18from the present price of Is. 4cL or Is. 5d. to a minimum of Is. Sd.
7. The War Cabinet continued the consideration of the corn production Bill, adjourned from the 26th March, 1917 (WarCabinet, 104, Minute 21). They had before them a Memorandumon Guaranteed Prices for Wheat and Oats (G.T.-234, Appendix I),and Notes on Part I of the Bill by Mr; J. R, Campbell (G.T.-341,Appendix II).Three main problems were discussed : (a.) Whether the prices guaranteed by the Bill should apply tothe quantities of wheat and oats produced or sold.(b.) Whether &quot;Wage Boards should be set up immediately orpostponed till after the War.(c.) Whether the powers to enforce proper cultivation, taken inPart IV of the Bill, should apply to Ireland.Under (a) it was argued that payment for quantity producedwould prove a greater stimulus to production, and was the only wayto help&apos; the small grower who feeds his grain to his own stock.This, it was pointed out, was the view which, had been taken byLord Selborne&apos;s Committee on Agricultural Policy. On the otherhand, it was argued that the machinery required to give etfect to payment according to produce would be very cumbersome and opento abuse. It would be impossible to examine and estimate the crops on each of the hundreds of thousands of farms ; the marketprovided an automatic check, and re-sale might be made a penaloffence. It was also undesirable to pay the good and the bad farmeralike. The House of Commons would want to know to whatexactly the Treasury was committing itself; it would be unwilling to guarantee payment according to the estimate of official valuers.Lastly, in view of the submarine menace, a time might come whenit would be essential to force every form of cereal into the market for use as human food, and to stop, or at least greatly discourage,the feeding of oats to stock.The Secretary for Scotland stated that his advisers favouredpayment on the basis of grain sold.The Chief Secretary for Ireland held that, if production werethe basis, the State would be paying twice in some cases ; that payment for produce sold was most in harcnony with the PrimeMinisters declaration in the House of Commons, and had been sointerpreted in Ireland, where also it had been assumed that the guaranteed price would be for the best quality, and not for inferiorstuff.   This, Mr. Duke urged, should be made clear in the Bill.Mr. Campbell added that there were about 450,000 corn-growing holdings in Ireland, and that the majority of them did infact market some corn.Under (b) the Bill was criticised as being defective in important respects; the term &quot; week&quot; was not defined, and would lead toconfusion as it stood ; the deductions for payments in kind avouMmeet with strong opposition in Parliament, as would also the use ofthe officers of the Department of National Service as assessors the reference to the setting up of Wage Boards was too indefinite.In reply to these criticisms, it was urged that the Bill as drafted was conceived as a temporary measure, and that many points were purposely left vague for the time being, pending a thorough recasting of the machinery after the war.The Chief Secretary for Ireland reminded the Cabinet that hewas proceeding successfully with the setting up of Wage Boards inIreland, and that temporary rates were being fixed.Under (c) the Chief Secretary for Ireland strongly opposed theextension of Part IV. of the Bill (Power to Enforce Proper Cultiva-tion) to Ireland: it would intensify the bitter agitation on the part
of the landless for the breaking up and distribution of the grazinglands.(a.) The War Cabinet confirmed its previous decision (WarCabinet, 76, Minute 10) that the prices guaranteed bythe Bill should apply to the quantities of wheat and oatsmarketed and sold. Subject to this alteration in theBill, Part I was approved.(6.) The War Cabinet requested the President of the Board of -Agriculture and Fisheries to consider, with the Parlia-mentary draughtsman, the advisability of providing inthe Bill for the setting up, after the war, of WageBoards by reference to the Trade Boards Act, 1909, andby taking power to deal with the defects above referred by Regulation.(c.) In view of the possible very serious food situation, and thenecessity of obtaining the fullest powers to enforcecultivation throughout the country, the War cabinet decided that the principles underlying Part IV. of theBill should apply to the whole of the United Kingdom.(Initialled) D, LI.

APPENDIX I.G.T.-334. --Memorandum on Guaranteed Trices for Wheat and Oats.THE proposals embodied in the Bill endeavour to insure the farmer against the low prices, the fear of which constitutes his chiefobjection to a return to arable cultivation.The question that was raised at the meeting of the War cabinet was whether the prices guaranteed by the Bill should apply to the quantities of wheat and oats produced or sold.To make the position clear, an example may be given. the guaranteed price for wheat of the 1917 harvest is fixed at 60s. per quarter. Let it be assumed that the &quot; Gazette &quot; price for the seven months, the 1st September, 1917, to the 31st March, 1918, is foundto be 57s. 6d. per quarter. The grower is entitled to receive thedifference, 2s. I5d. per quarter, for each quarter he has produced (orgrown and sold). The grower is free to sell at his convenience andwhen he pleases, and no account is taken of the price he obtains.Some farmers will obtain more than the &quot;Gazette &quot; price, which isan average. Thus, one farmer may grow seed wheat for which heobtains the special price of 60s.&apos; In that case his returns will be60s. per quarter plus the 2s. 6d. allowance, or 62s. 6d. in all.Another farmer may have harvested his wheat badly so that he canonly obtain for it 52s. 6d. per quarter. His returns will be 52s. 6d.plus 2s. 6d., or 55s. in all per quarter. A third farmer may speculation-late for a rise in price and hold his wheat in stack until May,when he may be able to sell it at 65s. per quarter, on which the allowance of 2s. 6d. will also be paid, making his return 67s. 6d. per quarter. As an offset to this extra price he will have lost weight,and will not earn the allowance on so many quarters as he wouldhave had if he sold in the previous October.On the question of whether the allowance should be paid onthe quantity of corn produced or on that grown and sold, thearguments may be summarised as follows (the question arises inpractice mainly over oats, as most of the wheat is sold) : 1. The object of the Bill is to encourage production of cereals.Therefore a small grower who does not usually sell his crop, or the farmer who normally thrashes his oats from day to day for his stock,may claim that as they have increased their production they areentitled to any advantages guarantees offer.2. If the quantities entitled to the allowance are determined onsales only, a large number of &quot;sales made solely for the purpose ofobtaining the allowance would result. Many men would needlesslyincur the expenses of preparation for market and sale.3. The necessity of selling in order to earn the allowance willforce a quantity of poor corn on to the market, thus lowering the&quot; Gazette &quot; average and increasing the payment to be made by theState.4. The statement by the Prime Minister on which farmers haveacted in arranging their cultivations was ambiguous on this point.It is capable of being construed as a guarantee of a minimum price for the individual^ crop, and if it is defined by the Bill as aguarantee of price for the country&apos;s crop, and, further, for only such part of it as is sold, the farmers will have a strong case for claiming that the promise is not being fulfilled.5. The report of the Selborne Committee, that it is &quot; essentialthat payment should be based on the number of quarters actuallyharvested,&quot; raises a Parliamentary difficulty if the payments are proposed on only such part of the crop as is sold.
At first sight the balance of convenience to the State wouldappear to be on the side of the grown and &quot; sold &quot; basis. In either case sales would become the main evidence determining the quantityon which the producer was entitled to an allowance. The ultimatecheck would, however, be that of the grower&apos;s power of production,whether the allowance was paid on the quantity grown and sold orproduced. As a grower can buy as well as sell, the only method of checking at the end of the season whether a grower has sold cornwhich had previously been sold by some other grower would be toexamine whether on his acreage he could have produced the corn onwhich he claims an allowance. Thus production must become theultimate test on which payments are to be made. In any year inwhich there was a large difference between the &quot; Gazette &quot; andthe average price, the financial result to the State obtained by thetwo methods would be much the same.If the basis of production is adopted, a clause should be inserted in the Bill enabling the Board of Agriculture to schedule areaswithin which payments would be made on estimates of yield.Per contra, it may be argued 1. That the administrative difficulties presented by payment on production are greater. In many cases, particularly among thesmaller growers in Ireland and Scotland, payment would haveto be made on an estimated yield based on acreage. This estimatewould involve some special arrangements, and then would be liableto errors tending to over-payments by the State, it could only with difficulty and imperfectly differentiate between good and badfarming.2. On the sales basis, the volume of administration and thenumber of payments would be less. In years when the differencebetween the &quot; Gazette &quot; price and the guarantee was small, manyfarmers would forgo the allowance in order to be unhampered indealing with their oats at their convenience.
APPENDIX IEG.T.-341. -Notes on Part 1 of Corn Production Bill.Plan in the Bill 1. Not a minimum &quot; price,&quot; as promised by the Prime Minister.2. Offers special advantages to the best corn-growing district.3. Does not offer the same inducement to farmers on second-class grass lands to plough. It therefore misses the second of thechief aims (the first being food production), viz., helping to plant agood agricultural population on the land.4. Administratively unworkable. Would require armies of officials, clerical and inspectorial; and would lead to uncontrollableconfusion.Alternative plan for consideration A minimum price for wdiat is sold.A market to be provided where farmer can get minimum price.Use for this purpose the stores of existing corn dealers, whosepremises and business would be controlled.The minimum price in the Bill being for first quality, prices ofother qualities to be regulated according to present custom of thetrade.Oats, if resold to farmer, to be converted.This plan 1. Provides the promised minimum price to all who claim it.2. Is fairer to the cultivator of second-class land.3. Best fits in with the custom of the trade.4. Makes best and most economical use of existing machineryof trade.5. Is administratively simple and controllable as well as theleast expensive.(Signed)      J. R, CAMPBELL.Irish Office,April 2, 1917.
