With reference to War Cabinet 136, Minute 17, the WarCabinet noted that Mr. Balfour had asked that the question of any alteration in British diplomatic representation in the United states might be postponed until his return to England.The War Cabinet decided, however, that this need not debar adecision with regard to a business man being appointed as the Headof all the Missions representing the different Departments concerned,such as the Admiralty, the War Office, the Ministry of Munitions,the Shipping Controller, and the Food Controller.It was pointed out that these Missions were at present withouta responsible Head, with the result that there was some conflict of interests, and that, by co-ordinating their action, thus preventingoverlapping and one Department bidding against another, far betterresults might be expected to ensue. Although the person selectedwould no doubt have a great deal to do with Americans, his primarydirty would be to control our own operations, including recruiting,production, purchase, manufactures, transport, and the priority ofthe various claims.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out the desirability of consulting-Mr. Balfour before any definite appointment was made, so thatwhoever was selected might be acceptable to the Americans ; other-wise harm might result.Those Heads of Departments concerned wdio were present, were of opinion that Lord Northeliffe might be a very suitable person forthis appointment, and the War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should draft a telegram,giving fully the whole situation and the desirability of suchan appointment, and forward the same to the Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who was requestedto transmit the telegram to the British Ambassador atWashington as well as to Mr. Balfour, and ask for an earlyexpression of their views on the proposed appointment.ForthcomingSocialist andDemocraticConference atLeeds.m11.

It would be undesirable to take any steps to suppress furtheradvertisements, or to prohibit the meeting itself, though itwas of such a revolutionary character. They requested the Secretary of State for War to take the necessary action to ensure that no soldiers in uniform attended theConference.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,May 25, 1917.
