The Western Front. 1. ON behalf of the Director of Military Operations, ColonelBartholomew explained that the fighting in the last two days had only resulted in local progress at a few points.   Some 000 prisoners 1had been reported so far.    The casualties were 11,000 for thetwo days.Mesopotamia. 2. Colonel Bartholomew read a telegram from General Maude,in which he stated that he now had room for manoeuvre for thedefence of Baghdad, and that, in the absence of any indications of aKussian offensive, he was redistributing his troops in order to fulfilhis mission of establishing British influence in the Baghdad vilayet.With the rolling-stock that he had captured, he hoped by the middleof May to be able to make use of the Baghdad-Samarra Railway.The United Statesof America:Bail wayConstructionTroops.3. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat the United States had offered the immediate services of 5,000railway construction troops. He proposed to accept the offer atonce, but considered that&apos; the troops would probably have, in thefirst instance, to be employed in helping the French with theirconstruction work on the St. Nazaire line.Timber: 4. The Secretary of State for War mentioned that he hadLabour Supply. received a private offer from Massachusetts of several companies oftimbermen, but considered it preferable to have an offer throughofficial channels, and had telegraphed to General Bridges to arrangeaccordingly.United- states troops :Volunteer force for Europe.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer read to the War Cabinet atelegram (No. 1199) from Mr. Balfour, addressed to the PrimeMinister, stating that the&apos; War Department were hesitating whether,in addition to a small regular force for the French, they should alsosend over a body of 100,000 volunteers to aid the British, and,raising the question, if this were done, whether they shoidd be trained in America or on this side of the Atlantic.The general view of the War Cabinet was that It was best to get the men over here as soon as possible, butthat the Secretary of State for War should go into thematter with the General Staff and prepare a message to besent on Saturday.-^Submarines.6. On behalf of the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the War Staffgave the usual statement of shipping losses for the previoustwenty-four hours.

Lord  Hardinge  read to the   War   Cabinet  a  telegramGermany.   . (No. 1058),, dated 3rd May, from The Hague,, reporting an interviewwhich had taken place there between Herr Guttmann, the editor ofthe &quot; Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; the organ of the German Chancellor,and Mr. Tower, a correspondent of the &quot;Daily Alail.&quot;   According
to Herr Guttmann, the Germans, while recognising the submarine campaign to be a failure, in that it would be impossible to reducethe Allies by hunger, were confident that the Western front couldnot be broken, and therefore complete exhaustion of all parties would result, unless peace was achieved at once. A telegram(No. 1076) reporting a further conversation between Herr Guttmannand Mr. Tower was also read to the Cabinet.8. With reference to M. Venizelos&apos;s desire that a Cretan division should be mobilised and brought into General Milne V force, theWar Cabinet decided that The matter must be postponed until a decision had been cometo on the question of the withdrawal of our forces from Salonica.9. The War Cabinet had before them   the Report of  the -Interdepartmental Committee  on Petroleum  Products, dated the26th April, 1917 (Paper G.T.-576).Mr. Pretyman, the Chairman of the Committee, explained themain recommendations of the Report, especially those contained inparagraph 10, which provided that any transfer of Messrs. Pearson&apos;interests should be made not to the Standard Oil Company itself,but to one of its subsidiary companies registered in the BritishEmpire, and that the British Government should be able, directly or indirectly, to exercise such a controlling interest in the purchasingcompany as to make a further transfer to non-British purchasersimpossible.The War Cabinet approved the conclusions as set forth&apos; in theReport.10. The War Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary ofState for War dealing with the diminished supply of beer to theNavy and Army consequent on the recent brewing restrictions (WarCabinet, 102, Minute 17, and War Cabinet, 106, Minute 1). Theminimum requirements of His Majesty&apos;s forces are estimated atI,000,0d0 barrels per annum. This allows considerably less than half a pint per man per day, which is regarded as an absoluteminimum. The total output for the current year has been fixed bythe War Cabinet at 10,000,000 standard birrels per annum. Theamormt of statutory beer due to the forces is 249,000 barrels perannum (forming part of the 10,000,000 barrels), leaving a deficiency of 751,000 barrels to complete the minimum requirements.The War Cabinet decided that The figure of 10,000,000 barrels fixed by the War Cabinet bereduced to 9,000,000 barrels, and that certificates for thebalance of 1,000,000 barrels be issued by the Eood Con-troller to the Army Canteen Committee for the use of HisMajesty&apos;s forces.11. The War Cabinet, at the instance of Lord Milner, brieflyconsidered the present position of the proposals to control the liquor traffic (War Cabinet 106, Minute 2). Lord Milner laid before theWar Cabinet a memorandum on the subject and a Draft Bill whichhe desired should be discussed at the earliest opportunity. It waspointed out that the promoters of prohibition were making use ofthe food situation- to further their objects, while there were signs insome quarters of that movement being regarded as one of Capitalversus Labour. If action Avere taken promptly by the Government,it would be possible to provide a fairly adequate supply of light
beer throughout the summer months, and thereby consume the stocks of malt now in the hands of the brewing trade.It was generally agreed that if State Purchase and Local Optionwere to be proceeded with the basis of purchase should be settledwithout delay. *The War Cabinet decided that The  whole  subject  should  be  brought  up for discussionimmediately after the return of the Prime Minister.(Initialled) A. 13.
