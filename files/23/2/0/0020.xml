Italy. 1. THE Prime Minister read a letter he had received from theBritish Ambassador at Rome, dated the 18th March, 1917, describing the very grave apprehensions of Baron Sonnino regarding the probability of a heavy attack by the Central Powers on the italian front, and expressing Baron Sonnino&apos;s regrets that the proposals made by the Prime Minister at Rome&quot; for Allied co-operation on theItalian Front (G-.-106) had not been carried out.The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that the ItalianGovernment had given no support to his proposals at the RomeConference.   The War Cabinet decided that The Director of Military Operations should send a telegram toGeneral Sir William Robertson, who is on a visit to theItalian Front, informing him of Sir Rennell Rodd&apos;s letter,and stating that the War Cabinet share Baron Sonnino&apos;sbelief in the probability of a heavy attack on the italian front, and that they are aware that the Chief of theImperial General Staff is of the same view, and warnedthem in this sense before his departure for Italy.It was further decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should transmit a personal telegram from the Prime Minister to the british ambassador at Rome (Appendix I) notifying him of theaction taken in regard to his letter, and authorising himto inform Baron Sonnino.Supply ofAeronauticalMaterial to Eussia.2. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the AirBoard on the subject of the Supply of Aeronautical Material toRussia (Paper G.T.-T53, Appendix II).Sir David Henderson stated we had 139 aeroplanes appropriatedfor Russia, but that owing to limitation of transport only seventyhad at present been shipped.Lord Milner stated chat no definite promise had been made toRussia in regard to the number of aeroplanes to be sent, beyond anundertaking that we would endeavour to ship up to a maximum of800 during 1917.Sir David Henderson laid great stress on the critical importanceof maintaining our aerial strength during the next few months inFrance, and pointed out that for this reason we could not spare anymachines before the end of June, but that this did not effect our undertaking to Russia, as no dates of supply in 1917 wereguaranteed.   The War Cabinet decided that A total of 800 aeroplances shoidd be ordered for shipment toRussia, but that no more than those dealt with under existing undertakings should be shipped until after the30th June, having regard to the importance of having anample supply of aeroplanes for the British ExpeditionaryForce in France during the next three months.The Supply ofBrock and PomeroyBullets to RussianGovernment.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a letter from theAir Board, dated the 13th March, 1917, raising the question whether an application for the supply of Brock and Pomeroy bullets to theRussian Government should be granted (Paper G.T.-157).The Director-General of Military Aeronautics opposed the grantof the application on the grounds that (a.) They had been supplied only for use at home against attack by airships ;(b.) They were used for no other purpose, as their use was notin accordance with The Hague Convention ;(c.) None had been sent to France or abroad ;
(d.j If sent to Russia, their identity would probably bediscovered by the enemy, and that this would lead not onlyto reprisals, but also to knowledge of the means by wdiichwe had been able to destroy Zeppelins, on which point the enemy was believed to be at present in ignorance., C: The War Cabinet decided that In these circumstances the Russian application should be refused, and that the President of the Air Board shouldacquaint the Russian NaA&apos;al Aviation Department of the strict limitations we had imposed on our own forces as tothe use of these types of bullets.4 The Secretary of State for War stated that he had consultedSir Eric Geddes.. and had arrived at the conclusion that, in view ofthe general shortage of. rolling-stock in Great Britain, France, andItaly it was quite impossible to carry out the scheme for an over-land route between Cherbourg and Taranto for at least anothertwelve months. The War Cabinet, while unable to make any finaldecision in the absence of the Shipping Controller and railwayexperts, decided that: The question should be brought forward for further discussion at an early date-Mesopotamia. 5. The Director of  Military Operations  read  to  the  WarCabinet a telegram dated the 21st March, 1917 (Appendix III),that he had just received from the General Officer Commanding theMesopotamian Expeditionary Force, relative to the respectivespheres of influence of the Russians and ourselves in Mesopotamia.The War Cabinet directed The Director of Military Intelligence to send the telegram asprinted in Appendix IV to General Sir S. Maude, and requested the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toinform His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Petrograd of the in-structions the British Government had issued in this matter.Body Armour. 6. The Master-General of the Ordnance reported that bodyshields were being sent to battalions on all fronts at the rate of400 per battalion. Both he and Dr. Addison indicated variousdirections in which  the subject was being developed, and showedseveral existing types of body armour, most of which, however, werenot proof against machine-gun fire at close range.The Master-General of the Ordnance undertook to obtain forthe War Cabinet a full report of the extent to which bodyarmour of various types had been used at the Front by theseveral battalions, and to what extent such armour had proved effective.Overland Eoute to salonica.Tanks.(1.) Supply.7. The Minister of Munitions reported that considerable delayshad occurred in the completion of the original estimate for the outputof Tanks. A serious miscalculation had been made in the original estimate. Tanks had been first used in September 1916. The finaldesign, however, had not been approved until the 23rd November,and the drawings had not been ready until the 7th January, 1917.According to the latest estimates, Dr. Addison hoped that theprogramme would only be a month or six weeks in arrear of theoriginal estimate. Having regard to the labour difficulties realised in the construction of Tanks, this would be a good engineeringperformance.Lieutenant-Colonel Stern gave the War Cabinet particulars ofthe various new types, including a small high-speed Tank and a heavy gun-carrier.
The Minister of Munitions further stated that he was not satisfied with the tank organisation and was taking steps to improve the same, and that everything was being done to speed up thesupply as much as possible.The Master-General of the Ordnance informed the War Cabinetthat only about sixty Tanks were in France, or in transit thereto, atthe present time fit for service, although Dr. Addison stated the totaldeliveries amounted to 250. This discrepancy was explained byLieutenant-Colonel Stern as due partly to losses on the Somme, partly to the difficulty of supplying sufficient spare parts, and partly to theheavy wastage, particularly among those retained in this countryfor instructional and experimental purposes. Lieutenant-ColonelStern stated also that some of those lost in France had already beensalved, and that further steps were being taken in this direction,The War Cabinet observed with concern that the number of tanks available in the immediate future for offensive operations on the Western Front is less than the number available last Septem-ber. They took note of Lieutenant-Colonel Stern&apos;s anticipationsthat when deliveries commenced they would take place in consider-able quantities, so that during the summer months, which were most favourable for the employment of these machines, largenumbers would be available.The Minister of Munitions, however, wished it to be clearly understood that if the rate of wastage and the requirements forspares in respect of the 1,000 Mark IV Tanks on order should prove to be on the same scale as for those already supplied, it would be quite impossible to keep anything like that number available for service.(2.) Tactics. 8. The War Cabinet directed The Director of Military Operations to forward the report ofthe Conference on Tanks, held on the 4th March,1917, to the Secretary, for circulation to the War Cabinet.(War Cabinet, 44, Minute 6.)Coal for Italy. 9. The War Cabinet had before them reports by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (G.T.-147-Appendix V) and (G.T.-211-Appendix VI), as well as a note by the Shipping Controller (G.T.-189 Appendix VII), on the subject of the very grave position inregard to the supply of coal to Italy, which country is at presentreceiving only about 42 per cent, of her minimum requirements.Sir Joseph Maclay pointed out that this situation was due notto any failure on our part, but on the part of Italy herself, aggravated,however, by neutral ships not being obtainable. He pointed&apos; outthat we had been passing through the worst period of the year from a shipping point of view ; the new arrangements for securingadditional tonnage from distant seas had not yet come into, opera-tion; and that in the event of the intervention in the War of theUnited States of America the shipping situation should be consider-ably relieved by the fact that American ships could be utilised, andthat wheat could then be obtained and financed in this nearermarket.Having regard more particularly to the apprehensions regardingan attack on Italy, referred to in Minute 1, and in view of the factthat France is receiving 61 per cent, of her minimum requirements,compared with Italy 42 per cent., the War Cabinet authorised The Shipping Controller to divert for a month or so to Italysome of the tonnage at present allotted to France, and to   Aacquaint the French and Italian Governments, through its proper channels, of the action taken.
Munitions of WarBill.10. The War Cabinet approved the presentation to Parliamentof the Munitions of War Bill.   (Paper G.T.-167.)Billeting of civilians Bill.11. The War Cabinet approved the presentation to Parliamentof the Billeting of Civilians Bill.   (Paper G.T.-166.)Transport Workers&apos;Battalions.Indian LabourCorps.Meat ImportsAfter the War.12. With reference to War Cabinet 95, Minute 4, and WarCabinet 96, Minute 6, the War Cabinet had before them a further report by the Board of Trade, dated the 22nd March, 1917 (paper g-.T.-242, Appendix VIII), on the subject of the Transport Workers&apos;Battalion, and decided To adhere to their ruling as communicated in War Cabinet 95,Minute 4, namely, that the raising of the TransportWorkers&apos; Battalions to a total strength of 10,000 men should be a prior charge on the men at the disposal of theSecretary of State for War.13. The Secretary explained the existing situation, and theWar Cabinet directed him to take the necessary steps to have thematter brought up for consideration at one of the Meetings ofthe Imperial War Cabinet.14. The President of the Board of Trade brought to the noticeof the War Cabinet his report, dated the 20th March, 1917 (paper g.T.-228, Appendix IX), relative to Meat Imports after the War.The War Cabinet decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The President of the Board of Trade, andThe Food Controller,should form a Committee, with Captain Clement Jones as secretary, to go into the general question and take such action as they deem necessary, rendering a report in due course forthe information of the War Cabinet. .Purchase ofShipping.15. The Shipping Controller reported to the War Cabinet thatthe price now being asked for shipping in the United States ofAmerica was exorbitant, and suggested, with a view to the possi-hility of obtaining lower quotations in the event of Americanintervention in the War, that any further purchases should be deferred for the present.   The War Cabinet decided that No further action should be taken in this matter until afterCongress had met on the 2nd April, 1917, when theShipping Controller should make a further report to theWar Cabinet on the subject.Summer Time. 16. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs reported to theWar Cabinet that opinions in Ireland varied with regard to theintroduction of Summer Time in Ireland (see G.T.-233, Appendix X);that a Bill was not required to bring the proposed procedure intoforce, and that an Order in Council was only necessary. The WarCabinet directed-&quot;-The Secretary of State for Home Affairs to take the necessary steps for the issue of an Order in Council institutingSummer Time in Great Britain and Ireland between the8th April, 1917, and the 17th September, 1917.
Liquor Restrictions. 17. The War Cabinet had before them the Report of the Com-mittee constituted by the Home Secretary at the request of the WarCabinet (War Cabinet 77, Minute 5) (Paper G.T.-241). Sir GeorgeCave explained the recommendations of the Committee, and statedthat in recent weeks there had been evidence that the policy of Statepurchase was increasing in favour, but in Ireland alone were the jj) flicensed victuallers willing to be bought out. Lord d&apos;Abernonpointed out that it would be difficult to arrive at a satisfactory basisof purchase, owing to the variation between the pre-War output of36,000,000 barrels and the restricted output of 10,000,000 about toCome into force, and it would be desirable to defer decision as topurchase until the Committees proposed to be set up had shownpurchase to be possible on satisfactory terms.Mr. Munro stated that the feeling in Scotland was strongly infavour of prohibition of spirits during the. War, and that the four ,chief Town Councils had passed resolutions to that effect. In viewof the special legislation affecting Scotland it would be difficult toarrive at a satisfactory basis for purchase, and Mr. Munro urged thePrime Minister to meet a deputation from the Town Councilsreferred to before arriving at any decision affecting Scotland in thematter.The War Cabinet decided-To approve the action recommended by the Committee in theirReport, paragraph 18, section (i), viz. : &quot; That action be taken for restricting the outputof beer and the release of wines and spirits from bondas described in paragraphs 5 to 8 of this Report.&quot;The War Cabinet deferred their decision on the question ofState purchase to a meeting when the Chancellor of theExchequer could attend.Railway Material .18- With reference to War Cabinet 47, Minute 21, the Primefor Russia. Minister -stated that he had received a telegram from Mr. Bury inregard to the deliveries of rolling-stock.Sir Robert Chalmers explained the position, and stated that thedelay in sending the wraggons and  locomotives to Russia was caused by (a.) Shortage of railway material ;(b.j Shortage of tonnage.He pointed out that, of the 9,000 waggons required for Russia,8,500 had been under order since last July. The War cabinet decided that-A reply should be addressed to Mr. Bury informing him that orders have already been placed for waggons nearly up tothe total mentioned in his telegram, and for half thelocomotives ; that enquiries have been made for sometime, but so far without success, to secure furtherlocomotives for early delivery ; and that all efforts will bemade to secure the desired result.Communication tothe Press in Regardto the Meetings ofthe Imperial WarCabinet and SpecialImperialConferences.19. The War Cabinet decided that The notices in the newspapers of the proceedings of theImperial War Cabinet should be confined to an announce-ment of the fact that a meeting had taken place, without giving the names of those present.They further decided that the same rule should apply to the Wsittings of the Special Imperial Conference at the ColonialOffice.
Proposed National 20. With reference  to War Cabinet  97,  Minute 23, LordWar Museum. Curzon reported that he had seen Sir A. Mond, and had suggested to him that the Museum Committee should be re-formed in such away as to enable Lord Harcourt to preside over it. Sir A. Mond was willing that his Committee should be converted, but only subject to conditions under which Lord Harcourt declined to serve. In thesecircumstances, Sir A. Mond will remain in charge of the collection,with Sir Martin Conway as his assistant.(Initialled.)      D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 23, 1917.
APPENDIX I.For Sir Rennell Rodd from Prime Minister.WITH reference to your letter of the 18th March, the War Cabinet fully share theapprehensions of Baron Sonnino as to the possibility of formidable German and austrian attacks on the Trentino and Isonzo fronts.Sir William Robertson arrives to-day at Italian Headquarters for the expresspurpose of going into the matter with General Gadorna and is fully alive to the dangers,and a telegram is being sent to him repeating the views of the War Cabinet.Please inform Baron Sonnino in the above sense.APPENDIX II.G.T. 153. --Supply of Aeronautical Materiel to Russia.I. Secretary Air Board to Secretary War Cabinet.Air Board Office, Strand, W.C.,Sir, &apos;       March 8, 1917.I AM directed by the President of the Air Board to request you to inform the WarCabinet that the Board have recently received from the Russian naval and militarydelegates in this country applications for the supply of large quantities of aeronauticalmateriel.The naval application comprises the the following :  120 Rolls-Royce 250 H.P. engines,250 Clerget 110 H.P. engines,50 Gnome engines,100 Nieuport machines,besides machine-guns, ammunition, cable, and instruments.The request of the military delegates is for 800 aeroplanes, and a furtherapplication is now, the Board understand, in course of preparation.As the War Cabinet are aware, the number of squadrons attached to the british expeditionary Force is undergoing large expansion, and the provision of the requisitemateriel will tax the manufacturing capacities of the country to the utmost. In fact,it is impossible for the Board at this moment to state with confidence that it will bepossible to complete in the near future the full programme put forward by Sir douglas haig.On the other hand, the measures in course of adoption by the Admiralty for thepurpose of meeting the submarine menace involve the construction of a large numberof additional seaplanes, which will entail a further drain upon the resources of the manufacturers of aircraft.In these circumstances,- the Board feel that, in the absence of special instructionsto the contrary, it is not open to them to do otherwise than inform the Russiandelegates of their inability to comply with their requests.The Board, however, understand that the general situation on the Russian fronthas recently been under the review of a Conference at Petrograd, and they think it right to draw attention to the above requests for assistance, in order that they may receive, if the War Cabinet think fit, special instructions on the subject,At the same time I am to request you to convey clearly to the War Cabinet thatany assistance given to the Russian Government in the matter of the supply of aircraft can only be furnished at the expense of our own forces, and in reduction of the considered programmes of the Admiralty and War Office.I am, &amp;c-    (Signed) H. P. HARVEY.
II. Note by Mr. Layton, Ministry of Munitions.All our cessions to Russia of British type material must of course diminisht -pro tanto the amount available for the British forces, and the allocation depends onk  relative need.^ The case for giving Russia aeroplanes is given in Section D, Chapter I, of our report, and the terms in which the offer was made are as follows : &quot;As many aeroplanes as possible, with machine guns and, for a certainproportion, with wireless apparatus, up to a maximum of 800 aeroplanes during1917.&quot;The 800 machines for the Army include those already promised, some of whichhave been delivered to Major Valentine.As regards motors, we were told in Petrograd that permission had already beengiven to place the necessary orders by the Anglo-French Committee in Paris, but wewere unable to verify this.I suggest that the Cabinet should be asked to rule at once as to the militarymachines, but that the naval ones should be considered later by the new Committee,with other naval and military demands not included in the Agreement.(Signed) W. T. LAYTON.Ministry of Munitions,March 12, 1917.APPENDIX III.Operations.From C.O.C., Force &quot; D,&quot; to G.I.G.S. (Repeated India).(X. 1368.) March 23, 1917.IN view of Russian troops impending arrival at Khanikin, it is advisable thatunits of our respective spheres of influence should be defined. I suggest that line of demarcation should run from Bedrah, through Mendali and Kizil Robat, along JebalHamrin Hills to Shoreimeh on Tigris. All above-mentioned places to be exclusive for ourselves, inclusive for Russia.APPENIDX IV.Telegram to Sir Stanley Maude.PROPOSALS made in your X. 1368 of the 21st March do not coincide withagreements arrived at between British, French, and Russian Governments. You will agree with the Russian commanders to observe spheres of action, the scope of whichwill be dictated only by military exigencies, and you will make it plain to the Russiancommanders that these spheres are only spheres of military action, and have no relationto spheres of political influence, which are defined by formal agreements already signed by the three Governments of Great Britain, Russia, and France. The political controland administration of the Ottoman territory occupied by either force to the south of alme drawn from a point on the Persian frontier north of the Wazna Pass along the lesser Zab and the line Kalajebaar on the Tigris to Abu Kemal on the Euphrates,0 should be placed in the hands of the C.P.O. in accordance with this agreement.
APPENDIX V.G-.T.-147.----Imports of Coal into France and Italy.(Note by the President of the Board of Trade.)I APPEND a table stowing the latest information available as regards the supplyof coal to France and Italy.I desire especially to direct the serious attention of the War Cabinet to the Italianfigures, which show that the imports of coal into Italy during the week ended the3rd March amounted only to 4,419 tons, showing a deficit of 195,581 tons, or 98 percent, of their weekly requirements. During the first nine weeks of the year theItalians have only received a total of 42 per cent, of their requirements.  -(Signed) A. H.

Stanley to Sir M. Hankey.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,IN reply to your letter of the 17th March on the subject of the supply of coal toItaly, I think that all I can do is to call the attention of the War Cabinet to the very grave position which has now been reached.I understand that the Italian Delegates on the Commission internationale deRavitaillement estimate the total quantity of coal that will be delivered in Italy duringthe period of the lst-31st March will amount to 385,041 tons, or 48\L3 per cent, oftheir requirements. In this connection it must be observed that this figure of 385,04includes a considerable quantity of the coal supplied by the Admiralty as an emergencymeasure, which is now beginning to arrive in Italy, but which, of course, will not continue.
60I am further informed that the quantity of coal which it is estimated will arrive in Italy during April next amounts to only 320,000 tons, or 40 per cent, of their requirements. The above quantities include coal from all sources including the parcelsof coal brought from the United States of America.There does not appear to he any possible action by the Board of Trade which willrelieve the situation, but having regard to the present, and prospective shortage, whichmay lead to most serious results, I think that the War Cabinet should have this matter under their consideration.Yours sincerely,(Signed) A.

APPENDIX VIII.G.T.-242.Transport Workers&apos; Battalions.THERE is no record of the actual words used by the Board of Trade representa-tive at the Conference at the Local Government Board on Tuesday, the 13th March, butthe statement attributed to him omits any reference to the conditions which the Boardof Trade regard as indispensable in the event of further transport workers being released for the Army.The views of the Board of Trade are clearly stated in the attached Memorandum,which was handed in at the Conference. It will be seen that the possibility of releasing men was distinctly stated to be contingent on the supply of substitutes (inthe proportion of 3 to 2) and on the taking of steps to bring the Transport Workers&apos;Battalions to the highest possible strength.   (See.paragraph 4 (d).)Board of Trade, March 22, 1917.Memorandum.Possibility of releasing 20 per cent, of total number of exempted Dock TransportWorkers.On the assumption that the War Cabinet imperatively demand such release, itcould, in my opinion, be effected in the following way : 1. The Board have already consented provisionally to the release of men under 20,as soon as substitutes are provided, with the possibility of a further release from month to month of men in the higher age groups up to 25. By definitely deciding on thisarrangement, and speeding it up, 5,600 men between .18 and 25 might be released inthe four months, April to July.2. The submarine difficulty in the North Sea has changed the conditions in theEast Coast ports during the last few weeks, and there is an admitted surplus, thoughit may only be temporary, at Hull and Leith, and I am inclined to think in Londonalso. At any rate, the London Committee, influenced by Major Rothschild, are, Ibelieve, prepared to carry out a drastic revision of existing exemptions. It might therefore be assumed that at Hull:        360 men between 25 and 30 could be released.Leith :        52   ,, ,,      ,,   ,,   ,,     ,,     ,,      ,,London: 4,522   ,, ,,      ,,   ,,   ,,     ,,     ,,       ,,The number for London being so high, I would suggest that only half be taken say, 2,300.It is possible, too, that Aberdeen, Dundee, Newcastle, Sunderland, Hartlepool, andMiddlesbrough are in a similar position to the other East Coast ports, and might therefore release men between 25 and 30, or a proportion, say half: AberdeenDundeeNewcastleMiddlesbroughHartlepoolSunderlandIpswich32 men61259308344223Total, 759Half, 379The total of all the above sources is 8,692.The number of exemptions outstanding is, in round numbers, 43,000 ; 20 percent, of this number is 8,600.4. It must be pointed out that (a.) The surplus at London and the East Coast ports generally may only prove tohe temporary.(6.) As there is a corresponding congestion at the West Coast ports, some of this surplus at the eastern side should be diverted to the west.
(c.) The taking away of all men up to 25, and of half the men between 25 and30, involves not merely the loss of these men, but a considerablediminution of the efficiency of the men who remain, younger, lusty men being necessary for the stiffening of the gangs.(d.) The difficulty mentioned in paragraph (c) above might be met to a certain extent by substitution and re-enforcement, the Director-General of NationalService providing three men for every two taken by a general pooling ofthe remaining surplus left after the withdrawal of men for the army.The additional requirements of the West Coast ports and emergencydemands from the East Coast ports might be met by a pooling scheme,and the Board have already under consideration such a scheme.Pooling must, however, be regarded as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, Mr. Chamberlains substitutes. The Transport Workers&apos;Battalion must also be brought up to the highest possible strength.5. The Board&apos;s position is therefore this: that they cannot assume the sole responsibility of taking the grave risks involved in the release of so substantial a proportion of the existing supply of dock labourers of military age, and that if thewithdrawal of certificates on so large a scale is insisted upon, the utmost must be done to safeguard the position of the dock transport industry, by facilitating a generalpooling of dock labour, provision of substitutes and re-enforcements, and the utilisation of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion. No single one of these devices can be relied upon to meet all emergencies ; all must be available.I should add that it is contemplated that the proposed general pool should, incertain cases, be available for the temporary supply of men for the canal wharves and railway yards in cases where a state of congestion in the ports is due to the holding upof railway waggons and barges, on traffic systems serving the ports. An extension ofthe Board &apos;s powers to deal with port labour might therefore be necessary, unless anarrangement could be made with the War Office.March 10, 1917.APPENDIX IX.G.T.-228. -Meat Imports after the War.THE late Cabinet, being apprehensive of the effect which the large Europeanshortage of meat after the war might have on the quantities and cost of our imports ofrefrigerated meat, appointed last summer a committee of their number to consider what steps, if any, should be taken to safeguard our supplies. The Committee, whichconsisted of Lord Harcourt, Mr. Runciman, Mr. Bonar Law, Mr. Balfour, Mr. McKenna,Mr. McKinnon Wood, and Lord Crawford, held three or four meetings, and came tothe conclusion that, as regards supplies from sources within the Empire, there need beno anxiety, as the co-operation of the Colonial Governments could be safely assumed.They approved certain measures for assisting British firms to extend our sources of supply, but as these would for a few years be of a small and tentative nature, it was thought important to ensure supplies from the River Plate by entering into a contract with the principal meat companies established in Argentine and Uruguay, includingthe American ones, which latter might otherwise be tempted by high prices to carrytheir meat to other markets.The Committee accordingly instructed Sir Thomas Robinson, who has throughoutthe war been assisting the Board of Trade, in the matter of meat purchases, to open negotiations with the British and foreign companies trading in the Plate with a view totheir entering into agreements with His Majesty&apos;s Government that would ensure forthis country for five years or so ample supplies of refrigerated meat at a reasonable price. This has been rather a difficult matter owing to the uncertainty of conditions for some time after the war, but fair progress has been made, and it is necessary forthe Government to decide whether the proposal should proceed. If this is approved, asI hope will be the case, I suggest that a small committee of Ministers should beappointed to deal with the outstanding points calling for decision, one of these beingthe question whether we should treat only on behalf of British consumers, or whether,as France is also exercised over this matter, we should also take into considerationtheir interests.(Initialled) A.

APPENDIX X.G.T.-233. -Summer Time Act.Memorandum.BY &quot; The Summer Time Act, 1916,&quot; it was provided as follows : &quot; 1. (1.) During the prescribed period in each year in which this Act is in force the time for general purposes in Great Britain shall be one hour in advance ofGreenwich mean time.&quot; (2.) This Act shall be in force in the year 1916, and in that year the prescribed period shall be from 2 o&apos;clock in the morning, Greenwich mean time, on Sunday the21st day of May until 2 o&apos;clock in the morning, Greenwich mean time, on Sunday the1st day of October, and His Majesty may in any subsequent year, by Order in council made during the continuance of the present war, declare this Act to be in force during that year, and in such case the prescribed period in that year shall be such period asmay be fixed by the Order in Council.&quot;&quot; (4.) This Act shall apply to Ireland in like manner as it applies to GreatBritain, with the substitution, however, of references to Dublin mean time for references to Greenwich mean time.&quot;&quot; The Time (Ireland) Act, 1916,&quot; repealed the words &quot; in Great Britain &quot; insection 1 (1) of the above Act and subsection (4) of the same section and provided asfollows : &quot;1. As from 2 o&apos;clock in the morning, Dublin mean time, on Sunday the 1st dayof October, 1916, the time for general purposes in Ireland shall be the same as thetime for general purposes in Great Britain, both during the periods when &apos; The SummerTime Act, 1916,&apos; is in force and at all other times.&quot;The late Home Secretary appointed a Committee (over which the Bight Hon. J. W.Wilson, M.P., presided) to inquire into the working of &apos; The Summer Time Act, 1916,&apos;and to consider whether, and on what conditions, summer time should be reintroduced.The Committee on the 22nd February, 1916, presented their Report, and therebyrecommended as follows :  (1.) That summer time should be renewed in 1917 and in subsequent years.(2.) That the period of the operation of summer time should be from the secondSunday in April to the third Sunday in September in each year.(3.) That the change from normal to summer time should be made on the night of saturday-Sunday and the reversion to normal time on the night of Sunday-Monday.(4.) That the variation from normal time should be one hour throughout the whole period.The Committee dealt specially with the case of Ireland, where they reported that opinion was divided, the very large majority of town dwellers being in favour ofsummer time, while the bulk of agricultural opinion was opposed to it. The followingextracts from the Report which refer to this question may be given here : &quot; It is not easy to see, at first sight, why so rmich more inconvenience should havebeen experienced by farmers in Ireland than in the rest of the United Kingdom,though it was pointed out to us that particularly heavy dews are experienced in thatcountry in the early mornings ; and some part of the explanation would also seem to lie in the circumstance which is mentioned in a number of replies, viz., difficulty in getting labourers to consent to changes in the working hours. In particular they seemto have objected to working after 6 o&apos;clock in the evening. So far as we are aware,this latter difficulty has not appeared to any appreciable extent outside Ireland, and we certainly do not think it should be regarded as insuperable......&quot; When the question is considered whether summer time is to be applied to ireland for the future it must of course be borne in mind that since October last the time inIreland has been permanently advanced by twenty-five minutes owing to the substitu-tion of Greenwich for Dublin time by &apos; The Time (Ireland^ Act, 1916,&apos; so that in theevent of  summer time being applied to Ireland in the same way as we  have
recommended above for the rest, of the United Kingdom, the advance would he twenty-five minutes in excess of what was experienced last year. This consideration is verymuch in the minds of those who are not favourably disposed towards the renewal ofsummer time in Ireland ; in fact, it would seem to be in many cases the principalground of opposition.&quot; We think, however, that its significance can easily be exaggerated. It may be noticed in the first place that, so far as summer time is concerned, Dublin and the east of Ireland are only a few minutes ahead of the west of England, Wales, and Scotland.Moreover, there would be more ground for apprehension if it were proposed to beginsummer time very early in the spring, or to continue it late into the autumn. In pointof fact, as has been seen, we have recommended, largely with Ireland in view, thatsummer time should end on the third Sunday in September, i.e., at the latest on the21st September instead of the 30th, as was the case last year; and that it should begin on the second Sunday in April, i.e., between the 8th and the 14th April inclusive,when the days are no shorter than at the beginning of September.&quot;The Committee included two Irish members, viz., Sir J. B. Lonsdale andSir W. Nugent.Since the publication of the report I have received representations from Irelandboth for and against summer time. The opinious of the local authorities in Ireland maybe summarised as follows : 	Favourable.	Against.	Neutral.bounties Rural districts Urban districts County boroughs	8, 31 60 3	17 137 18 1	1 11 4A deputation of forty-three members of Parliament, representing Irish agriculturalconstituencies, had an interview with the Chief Secretary for Ireland and myself, and asked that summer time should not be applied to Ireland.On the other hand, the railway authorities appear to be strongly opposed to any distinction being made between Great Britain and Ireland, the General Manager ofthe Great Northern Railway of Ireland stating that &quot; the immediate effect will be moreor less a complete dislocation of Irish train services, which are largely built ofmail steamer connections.&quot; The Postmaster-General states that from the Post Officepoint of view any differentiation between English and Irish time would entail a large amount of inconvenience and labour, as it would mean a complete recasting of the Irishpostal services every time there was a change in the English clock-time and Irishclock-time.I may add that there is considerable doubt, in view of the provision of &quot; TheTime (Ireland) Act, 1916,&quot; that the time in Ireland shall be the same as the time inGreat Britain &quot; both during the periods when &apos; The Summer Time Act, 1916/ is inforce and at all other times,&quot; whether any differentiation can he made without new legislation.I annex a Minute by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.Upon the whole I think that the balance of argument is in favour of uniformitythroughout the United Kingdom.The authorities of the Church of England have pointed out that if the change ismade on the morning of the 8th April (Easter Sunday) considerable inconveniencewill be caused to those who hold or attend the early morning services, and suggestthat the first or third Sunday in April might be substituted. On the other hand, the selection of an earlier Sunday would accentuate the Irish objection to any change, andthe postponement of summer time until a later Sunday would meet with objectionfrom the Board of Agriculture, who desire that the change shall be made as early aspossible. I think it will be better to adhere to the date selected by the Committee,which has already been made public.I submit a draft Order in Council for bringing summer time into operationbetween the dates and for the period recommended by the Committee.O. C.March 21, 1917.
Minute by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.Home Secretary.I find opinion in Ireland hopelessly divided with regard to the renewed applicationof summer time in this country under the Act passed last year.The whole practically of the agricultural population, i.e., an overwhelming majority numerically, desire that summer time should not be imposed. The urbanpopulation and the commercial classes generally wish that it should.The dislocation of transit arrangements by the introduction of a difference of onehour between English and Irish time would be disadvantageous.Advisers in whom I have confidence consider that the inconvenience to theagriculturalists will be overcome in practice.   I think this is probably a correct view.You need to consider, I think, whether there should be a short Bill this year to empower His Majesty in Council to suspend or modify the operation of the Act in casenecessity for such a course should appear, or whether some promise to take steps for avoiding inconvenience shall be taken if necessity appears.I can only say further that an Irish Parliament, if such a body were in existence,could not at present introduce summer time here.H. E. D.March 17,1917.Draft Order in Council.At the Court at Buckingham Palace,the      day of , 1917.Present :The King&apos;s Most Excellent Majesty in Council.Whereas by &quot; The Summer Time Act, 1916,&quot; as amended by &quot; The Time (Ireland)Act, 1916,&quot; it is provided that, during the prescribed period in each year in which theformer Act is in force, the time for general purposes is to be one hour in advance ofGreenwich mean time ; and it is further provided that His Majesty may in any yearsubsequent to the year 1916, by Order in Council made during the continuance of thepresent war, declare the former Act to be in force during that year, and in such casethe prescribed period for that year shall be such period as may be fixed by Order inCouncil.Now, therefore, His Majesty is pleased by and with the advice of his privy council to declare, and it is hereby declared, that &quot; The Summer Time Act, 1916,&quot; asso amended as aforesaid, shall be in force during the year 1917, and the prescribed period in that year shall be from 2 o&apos;clock in the morning Greenwich mean time on sunday, the 8th day of April, until 2 o&apos;clock in the morning Greenwich mean time on Monday, the 24th day of September.o
