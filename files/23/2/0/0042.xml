The Western Front.The Tanks.Heavy Artillery.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that inthe recent offensive on the Western Front the Tanks had done very well, and that none of them had been lost. The French, on theother hand, had, unfortunately, lost half the machines which took part in their offensive.The favourable reports that had recently been made about theBritish heavy artillery had been fully confirmed.Operations of theAllies.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet as to the dates of the next operation on the Western,Russian, and Italian Fronts. -Mesopotamia.East Africa.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that further attacks were in progress against the Turks on the righthank of the Tigris.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that forsome time he had not felt that the British operations in East Africawere being carried out as satisfactorily as could be desired. Hehad discussed the matter on more than one occasion with general smuts, who, while holding a high opinion of the Officer in command, Major-General A. R. Hoskins, had agreed that apparentlyhe had lost grip of the operations and perhaps had become tired.The War Cabinet authorised The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to relieve Major-General Hoskins of his command of the operations in EastAfrica, and to ask General Smuts to ascertain fromMajor-General van Deventer whether he would be willingto assume the Command of the British Forces in the placeof Major-General Hoskins.Palestine.The ChiefCommand.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read telegrams from the Commander-in-Chief, Egyptian Expeditionary Force,indicating that the attack on the Gaza position had not achievedsuccess, and that about a week must elapse before preparations wouldbe completed for a renewal of the offensive on a large scale.In reference to a previous Conference on the subject, held onthe 5th-6th April, 1917 (War Cabinet, 115a),* the War Cabinet,with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War and theChief of the Imperial General Staff, decided that A change should be made in the Chief Command of theEgyptian Expeditionary Force.General Smuts.6. It was pointed out that General Smuts had expressed verydecided views as to the strategical importance of Palestine to thefuture of the British Empire, and would therefore be likely to prosecute a campaign in that quarter with great determination, andthere was a strong feeling that he would be one of the mostsuitable selections for the Chief &apos; Command of the EgyptianExpeditionary Force.On the other hand, the War Cabinet were aware that there wasa growing opinion in favour of the retention of General Smuts in a central position in this country, with a view to the utilisation of his great qualities in the higher conduct of the War.* Not printed or circulated.
ImperialRepresentation onthe War Cabinet.7. This led to a short discussion on the general question ofImperial representation on the War Cabinet. The difficulties ofproviding permanent representation of the. Dominions were pointedout to be, firstly, that if all the Dominions were permanentlyrepresented in the Cabinet its numbers would become unwieldly ;and, secondly, that, if all the Dominions were not permanentlyrepresented, none of them would regard as satisfactory their repre-sentation by a Minister of another Dominion. An alternative solutionsuggested was that each Dominion should be represented in turn fora certain fixed period only.The Convoying of 8. In alluding to the recent, very serious shipping losses, theMerchant Vessels.    Prime Minister referred to the possibility of adopting the convoy system, which, he said, was favoured by Admiral Beatty and by admiral Sims.The First Sea Lord reported that the matter was under con-sideration, one of the chief obstacles to adopting such a schemebeing the shortage of torpedo-boat-destroyers. He stated that therewas some prospect of American destroyers being sent to assist us,and that six had already been ordered to leave for this country. Amuch larger number would, however, be necessary before any scheme of convoy could be introduced.The First Sea Lord mentioned that the trial of the convoy system by the Commander-in-Chief Grand Fleet had not beenaltogether successful, two vessels in separate convoys having alreadybeen torpedoed and sunk.The First Sea Lord undertook to make a further report on thematter to the War Cabinet.In regard to the above question, Lord Curzon pointed out that,though the matter came before the War Cabinet very frequently,they were never in a position to grasp the whole situation and place it under review. He suggested that a small but strong Committee,composed of a representative from the Admiralty, War Office, theShipping Controller, and the Minister of Munitions, with a memberof the War Cabinet in the Chair, should meet once a week to review the situation as regards food, shipping, and losses. He suggestedthat it would be convenient if this small Committee should sit everySaturday, so that it might present its report every week to the WarCabinet on the following Monday.The SubmarineMenace and food supply.9. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on the veryserious situation disclosed by the memorandum which had beensubmitted by the First Sea Lord, &quot; The Submarine Menace and food Supply&quot; (Paper G.T.-519).It was decided that Further information as to the Admiralty&apos;s estimate of futurelosses, the present and prospective situation in regard to food, and the absolute minimum of imports essential to theAllied armies and the existence of the Allies, was necessaryfor a full investigation of the subject to be made.In order to enable the above information to be collected, further consideration of the subject was deferred for a Special Meeting of the War Cabinet at 5 p.m. on thesame day.Submarines.10. The First Sea Lord gave his usual report of shipping-casualties due to enemy submarines, and stated that the Britishsubmarine &quot; E 50 &quot; had rammed and sunk an enemy submarine,and that it seemed probable that another- enemy submarine hadbeen sunk.[1365-124]B 2
Loss of an Airship.Prisoners of War:Stoppage ofParcels.Destroyer Action.11. The First Sea Lord also reported that a British coastalairship had been brought down and destroyed by the enemy.12. In reference to the reported stoppage by the Germans ofthe food sent to British prisoners in Germany (War Cabinet 122,Minute 14), the First Sea Lord reported that he had ascertained from an escaped British officer prisoner of war that the delivery offood packets sent out from England had been stopped in the caseof one camp for the week preceding the escape of the officer inquestion.The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet that hehad received similar information in regard to another camp, butthat he had discussed the matter with General Belfield and Sir StarrJameson, and had come to the conclusion that there was no evidencethat general instructions had been issued by the German Govern-ment to stop the food parcels to British prisoners of war.13. The First Sea Lord added a few details to the publishedcommunique on the subject of the recent destroyer action in theChannel, and mentioned several remarkable acts of individualgallantry.The War Cabinet instructed him To. arrange for the earliest possible, publication of a detailedaccount of the action before interest in the matter shoulddie down.Poland.Secession of bulgaria from theCentral Powers.14. Lord Robert Cecil read a draft of a statement which it was proposed to make in the House of Commons in regard to Poland.He explained that Mr. Balfour had promised that a statement shouldbe made in which there would be a reference to the RussianProclamation. The draft had been sent to the British ambassador in Petrograd, who had approved it, and explained that the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs had also approved it, especially if some reference were made to unity in the sense in which this had been done in the proclamation of the Russian Provisional Government. He suggestedthat the statement in the House of Commons should be made either by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House.The War Cabinet approved of the proposed statement beingmade.15. The Prime Minister, in reference to the report on the recentAnglo-French-Italian Conference (Paper I.C.-20), stated that theItalians entertained considerable hopes of Bulgaria seceding fromthe Central Powers, and possibly even coming in on the side of theAllies. Baron Sonnino had informed him that he had so far taken no steps to forward this matter for fear of arousing the jealousy ofthe French, though he was extremely anxious that every encourage-ment should be given to Bulgaria. The Prime Minister was ofopinion that if the Allies were to succeed in inflicting a defeat ofany magnitude on the Bulgarians at Salonica, the latter mightnot only break away from the Central Powers, but might turn onthe Turks.Lord Robert Cecil read a report to the effect that the Bulgariansmight very possibly be induced to turn against the Turks, that they wanted to retain Grecian Thrace, would not give up any territorysouth of the Danube, but would be willing to cede Monastir and part of Macedonia. Lord Robert Cecil suggested that a reply should be sent to the effect that the British Government would bevery glad to receive and consider any definite proposals put forward by the Bulgarian Government.The War Cabinet approved this action.
Salonica. 16. In continuation of the report on the recent Conference(Paper I.C.-20), the Prime Minister stated that, at his interviewin Paris with M. Ribot, M. Painleve, and General Nivelle, he had handed in the memorandum on the Protection of Shipping in theMediterranean (Paper G.T.-481, dated 17th April, 1917) preparedby the First Sea Lord, and also the comments of the Chief of theImperial General Staff thereon (Paper G.T.-481 A, dated 17th April,1917). He had informed the French representatives at the(**) Conference that the shipping situation might compel us to insist ona withdrawal to a shorter front at Salonica. In the conversation which followed M. Ribot and M. Painleve had shown less oppositionto this proposal than he had anticipated, provided that we would assist them to clear up the situation in Greece itself, including, ifnecessary, the removal of King Constantine from the throne. ThePrime Minister was inclined to the view that a bargain might he made on these lines for the reduction of the British forces in the balkans.It had eventually been agreed that the whole question shotddhe considered at a further Conference to be held in two weeks&apos; time,when the situation, on the Western front would be more clear andthe time more suitable for a comprehensive review of the wholemilitary and political situation.Italian Aspirations 17. In reference to the passage in the report of the Anglo-in Asia Minor. French-Italian Conference  dealing with the Italian  claims,  thePrime Minister said that he himself was inclined to accede to theItalian claims for Smyrna, but that if the War Cabinet shared thisview he thought it would be necessary to insist very strongly that italy could not hope to obtain such a great territorial acquisitionunless she was prepared to increase the effort she was making in thewar. He suggested, as an example of the way in which Italy might do this, that she might supply, either directly or by substitutingItalian troops for British forces withdrawn from elsewhere, there reinforcements for Egypt recently asked for by General Sir A.Murray.Lord Hardinge pointed out that there were important Britishinterests in Smyrna, and that it was highly desirable that these should not be injured by any transfer of territory to Italy. he urged that the condition should be made that Smyrna should be a free port.In this connection Lord Robert Cecil reminded the War Cabinetthat Lord Grey had undertaken that British interests in Smyrnashould not be an obstacle to Italian aspirations in that quarter.The War Cabinet agreed that if the Smyrna district wereallocated to Italy after the war it would be necessary to stipulate that Smyrna should remain a free port.   It was decided that. The Foreign Office should draft, for the consideration of theWar Cabinet, a telegram to the British Ambassador in rome, based on the following considerations: (a.) That the British Government would be prepared toinclude Konia within the prospective Italiansphere of influence.(6.) That they would not, however, undertake that thequestion of what each nation was to receive afterthe war could be entirely dissociated from theefforts they had made in the common cause ofthe Allies, and that they were not altogethersatisfied that Italy&apos;s exertions had been in proportion to her powers.
Man-Power:Secret Session.Increase ofPortugueseContingent.18.ToThe War Cabinet decided that requests made in the House of Commons for information about man-power, a reply should be given in the se^sethat the matter was to be dealt with in Secret Session, andthat a postponement should be asked for in regard to acorresponding question in the House of Lords.19. In reference to a further communication from the portuguese-guese Government urging an amendment of the decision of theBritish Government against any increase of the Portuguesecontingent already in France (War Cabinet 104, Minute 13), theWar Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for War to reply that shipping con-siderations compelled the British Government to adhere toits previous decision.(Initialled)      D.
