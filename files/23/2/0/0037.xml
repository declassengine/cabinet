Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary.Colonel E. D. Swinton, C.B., D.S.O., Assistant Secretary.The Western Front. 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff amplified the press communique in regard to the recent German counter-attack on our forces between Camhrai and St. Quentin. The attack had beenmade at 4-30 A.M., and had been delivered with great determination.Only at Lagnicourt had this effort of the Germans achieved anysuccess. At this point some bodies of the enemy had penetrated 2,500yards, but he had been counter-attacked in turn by us, and all theground lost had been regained. This event pointed to two con-elusions. Firstly, that the Germans had probably always intended,on reaching the Hindenburg line, to counter-attack our advancingforces when the latter were on unfavourable ground, and before theywere consolidated : secondly, that the Germans attached greatimportance to the southern end of the Drocourt-Queant line, andwould resist to the utmost any attempt to turn it.
Strength of Britishand german forces.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGermans had 60 Divisions opposed to the 63 British Divisions onour sector of the Western Front, and that 20 of the german divisions were on the Lens-St. Quentin Front. Of the 25 german divisions in reserve on the British section of the Western Front,9 had been drawn into action by our attack.The economic importance of theLens Operations.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained the favourable economic results which might be hoped for from a successful issue to the operations in the vicinity of Lens. The coalmines of Lens itself would probably be damaged by the enemy, andsome months might elapse before they could be placed in a workingcondition. The Grenay coal mines, however, were within our lines,although too close to the Front to be worked hitherto. Unless theywere connected by unknown galleries with the undergroundworkings of the Lens mines, work could be commenced on themvery shortly. Further, an advance of a few. miles forward in theneighbourhood of Lens would enable us to reopen the Lens-Arrasrailway. This would give direct communication between the Lenscoal-mining area via Arras, Amiens, and Paris, thus obviating thenecessity for taking the coal to Paris by a devious route via thecoast, as had been hitherto obligatory.The Secretary of State for War stated that, when in Paris, hehad been informed that the recovery of this section of the railway system would go far to restore the situation on the Frenchrailways.The FrenchOperations.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theFrench operations undertaken immediately south of St. Quentinappeared to have failed, owing, it was believed, to inadequateartillery preparation.   He communicated the date of the forth-coming main French operation.French military policy.5. In reference to Imperial War Cabinet 9, Minute 3, thePrime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he had heard fromM. Thomas some further details of the. attitude recently assumedbv the French Government towards General Nivelle. This wassupple mented by information furnished by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff. It appeared that General Nivelle had summoned ameeting of his Army Commanders, at which his plan of operations for the future had been criticised by General Petain, who, thoughhis senior in service, was now subordinate to him. As a result ofAvhat occurred, General Petain communicated directly with theFrench War Cabinet, and General Nivelle was summoned to aConference, at which he refused to explain or justify his plan beforeone of his own subordinates. After this certain French ministers had proceeded to the French Front to discuss the situation, and matters had since been put on a proper footing.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that, after having approved the plan adopted by the French Commander-in-chief in its initial stage, the French Government had proceeded to throw doubt on its soundness, though nothing had occurred inbetween to justify this change of attitude, and that such conductwas hardly fair on the man who had to execute the operations.The Prime Minister was of opinion that it must have been,difficult for the French Government to ignore any arguments put before them by an officer of such high position as General Petain.
The german counter Blow.a6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained that therewere no signs of any great German counter-stroke being in preparation against us on another part of the front, as had been assumed in some quarters was the case, nor were there any signsof the Austrians making an attack on the Italians as the latter had feared-;-----On-the -other hand, intelligence pointed to the factthat the enemy was massing in front of the French.Casualties in the arras Fighting.7. The Secretary of State for War reported that up to the night of the 15th April the British casualties had amounted to1,600 officers and 48,000 other ranks, and that of these 90 of the casulties among officers and 2,700 of those amongst other rankshad occurred in the previous twenty-four hours.Gun AmmunitionExpended in the arras Battle.S. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that sincethe 4th April, when the bombardment had started, a total of4,000,000 rounds of gun ammunition had been expended, and gave the details. He added that he considered, so far as artillerywas concerned, that we held the superiority over any army in thefield.Italy. 9. The  Chief of  the  Imperial   General  Staff stated  thatGeneral Foch was returning from Italy to France, for whatreason he did not know. He also read extracts from a letterreceived from the Head of the British Mission at Italian Head-quarters, conveying the thanks of General Cadorua for the artillerylent by the British, and stating that the Italian Commander-in-Chief had suspended from duty certain senior officers who were too old for their work, amongst whom were three Corps Commanders.The reception of the British detachment by the Italians had beenexcellent, and its arrival had had a most encouraging effect on our allies.Bussia. 10. The Chief of the Imperial  General Staff referred to atelegram received from General Hanbury-Williams, at Petrograd,describing the very bad state of the Russian Navy, and the dangerous situation at Kronstadt, Helsingfors, and Reval. he added that he was taking steps to recall General Hanbury-Williamsfrom Russia.Egypt. 11. In reference to a telegram received from General Murray,the Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, theSecretary of State for War stated that, the reason why 30 miles of rail, which had been promised to General Murray, had been diverted to France was, that it was urgently required on theWestern Front, and that an equivalent amount of permament-way,obtained partly from Salonica and partly from other sources, wouldbe sent out to reach Egypt by the time that it was actuallyrequired.The Air Sendee. U In reference to the discussion on the Air Servic   u-hichtook place at the Meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on the12th April, 1917 (Imperial War Cabinet 9, Minute 1), the WarCabinet had under consideration Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haio-&apos;telegram on the subject, therein quoted, which, it was a^ree^dpointed to a very serious position of affairs in regard to equipment.&apos;Ihe Secretary explained that he had already asked the Chairman
of ttie Air Board to consider the equipment position as animadvertedupon by Sir Douglas Haig, and to submit a report on the subjectto the War Cabinet as soon as possible.Palestine.13. In reference to War Cabinet, .116, Minute 13, and a*,\telegram received from&quot; General Murray on the subject ofGeneral Bailloud being sent out with the French detachment oftwo battalions joining the British Forces, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff enquired what instructions he should send to GeneralMurray.   The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should draft a telegram to the French Government for despatch by the ForeignOffice, and that the attitude to be taken up was one of protest against General Bailloud&apos;s appointment, whichwas objectionable on military grounds, since it would entail a very senior officer being in command of a force oftwo battalions.Conference withthe Italians.Submarines.Hospital ShipsReprisals.14. The Prime Minister stated that he had arranged to proceedto attend a Conference with M. Bibot and Baron Sonnino on theItalian frontier, on Saturday, the 21st April. The War Cabinet,at the Prime Ministers suggestion, decided that The Secretary should accompany the Prime Minister on his mission.15. The First Sea Lord made his usual statement of mercantilecasualties. He reported damage, caused by a torpedo, to the sloop&quot; Veronica,&quot; which had, however, returned to port.16. In reference to the Imperial War Cabinet 9, Minute 12,the First Sea Lord reported that a reprisal raid had been carriedout against the town of Freiburg on the night of the 14th April by23 British machines in co-operation with 15 French machines, andthat 3 of the British machines were missing.In regard to the communication to the Press of the fact thatthis raid had been made as a reprisal, and the reasons for so doing,it was decided that: The Admiralty should draw up a careful Communique, whichshould be submitted to the Department of Informationbefore issue to the Press.Air Raids.17. The First Sea Lord reported that air raids by seaplaneshad been carried out upon destroyers at Zeebrugge and Bruges,and also upon the blast furnaces at two places.The United Statesof America.that   he  had  received a naval Attache at Washington to18. The  First  Sea  Lord  statedcommunication from the Britishthe effect that the International Conference has been a great success, very largely owing to the efforts of Admiral Browning.He now anticipated that the naval co-operation of the United Statesof America would be wdiole-hearted and more effective than hadbeen hoped.
Mine-Laying by 19. The First Sea Lord stated that the mine-laying activitiesthe Germans. Qf ^]ie Germans had increased very much since -the beginning or&quot;the year, and produced a statement giving details to this effect(Appendix I). In regard to the provision of mine-sweepers wehad no more now than we had a year ago, and he had been pressingupon the American naval authorities the urgent necessity for theprovision of such vessels.The Transport 20. The First Sea Lord stated that a report had been received&quot; Cameronia.&quot; at Malta that the transport &quot; Cameronia &quot; had been torpedoed onits way to  Port Said with 2,100 troops on board, en route for egypt.Norway.21. Lord Robert Cecil stated that it seemed as if theNorwegian Government was likely to agree to the suggestedtransfer of shipping to the British flag. If this were done, it was feared that the Germans would undertake reprisals in reply. Heenquired, therefore, what assistance could, in this event, be givento Norway in the way of provisioncraft.    The  Norwegians had askedof anti-aircraft gunand air-for twenty aeroplanes andthirteen guns.The difficulty, owing to our own requirements, of supplying the latest type of machine, was pointed out by the Secretary ofState for War, but, in view of the paramount importance ofshipping to the Allies at the present juncture, the War cabinet decided that The question of the provision of aeroplanes and anti-aircraft guns should be referred to the Air Board, with a strongexpression of opinion that the War Office and theAdmiralty should make every effort to meet the demandsof the Norwegian Government.22. In reference to the decision of the War Cabinet at theMeeting held on the 22nd March, 1917 (War Cabinet 102, Minute 3),as to the employment of explosive and incendiary bullets for use against Zeppelins, and to the request from the Norwegian Govern-ment for the supply of such bullets, the First Lord stated that hehad been under the impression that the decision of the WarCabinet had been that they were not to be used except in theBritish Isles, and, for that reason, had refused to ask for them for employment in the Mediterranean.It was decided that The previous decision of the War Cabinet on this subject should not be departed from.Interview with the 23. The Eirst Sea Lord reported that, at the request of theFirst Sea Lord.        Foreign Office, he had granted  an interview to an Americanjournalist, Mr. Allen, one of whose objects was to convince theUnited States of the seriousness of the submarine campaign.   he himself, however, was strongly opposed to  the   publication of:. interviews with Naval and Military Officers, and, before publicationtook place, desired the sanction of the War Cabinet. The WarCabinet decided that: Lieutenant-Colonel John Buchan, the Director of theInformation Department, should advise them as towhether the publication of this particular interview was of such importance as to justify them in over-ruling thegeneral objections of the First Sea Lord.Incendiary andExplosive Bullets.[1365-119]C
24. The question of the reasons for the Ch&apos;der for the prohibitionof the export of &quot; The Nation,&quot; which bad been in force since the29th March, was considered by the War Cabinet.It was pointed out that practically since the beginning of theyear the tone of certain articles in this paper had been such as to cause depression amongst our own Forces, to have a bad effect onour Allies, and to encourage our enemies; in short, to prejudice theAllies&apos; chance of success in the war and also the cause for which ^they were fighting.The main directions in which these articles were objectionablewere: 1. That their tendency was to show that it was quite hopelessfor the Allies to expect success.2. That they continually praised German strategy and tactics,to the detriment of that of the Allies on the western front, more especially of our own.3. That they amounted to an encouragement of the variousAssociations organised in this country to promote peace,and   a  continual  suggestion   that   peace,   howeverinconclusive, would be better than a continuation ofthe struggle.In regard to the action as to prohibition taken in the matter bythe War Office, it was explained that this was not a new departure,but was the application to a special case of a long-established principle.In accordance with this principle the circulation abroad of the&quot; Labour Leader&quot; and the &quot; Tribunal&quot; had been stopped so farback as July 1916. It was also explained that there was a verygreat difference between the circulation of dangerous literature inthis country (where the character of the writers and that of the papers in which the literature appeared were known, and might,where necessary, he discounted) and circulation in foreign countries,where such writings would he accepted at their face value asauthoritative, and where no such counteraction of their detrimentalinfluence could be brought into play.The Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of the WarOffice, and the &quot;Director of Special Intelligence, stated that inthis case the prohibition had not been the action of the Militaryalone, but had been carried out with the knowledge andconcurrence of the Foreign Office and the Home Office, and afterthe British Commander-in-Chief in France had stated that thecontinued publication of such articles was particularly inadvisableat the present time.It was made clear, moreover, that, so far from being a hastyand ill-considered action, the prohibition of export of the paperconcerned, owing to the nature of its contents, had been contem-plated by the authorities for some months, but action had been deferred until definite proof had been obtained that harm was actually being done. This proof was furnished by the officialGerman Wireless Communique of the 26th March, which quotedlong extracts from &quot;The Nation&quot; of the 3rd March, in which british strategy was compared unfavourably with that of theGermans, and the strategic situation for the British painted in verygloomy colours. On the 29th March, after the receipt of thisproof of the propaganda use of the article in question being madeby the Germans, the War Office prohibited the export of &quot; TheNation.&quot;The Prime Minister pointed out that that paper claimed to speak for British Liberals, and would, no doubt, be accepted by our Allies as so doing; that just at the moment when the enemy was war-weary and feeling that the end might not be far off, theeffect of such articles would be to encourage him to continue thestruggle; and that prohibition of the export abroad of literaturehaving this tendency should be carried out in whatever periodical itProhibition of theExport of&quot; The Nation.&quot;
appeared. In regard to prohibition, once decided on, he was disintegration-clined to make any promises for the future as &quot;to relaxation, but ifthe nature of the articles in the prohibited journals&apos; underwent achange for the better which appeared likely to be permanent,relaxation of the embargo might be considered. He was quite satisfied that in the case under consideration the action taken hadnot been an arbitrary act of the Military alone, such as might causeprejudice. He considered that the matter was of such importance that he was prepared, if available, to deal with it himself in theHouse of Commons, and that, if he was not able to do so, it shouldbe dealt with by the Leader of the House.The War Cabinet approved the action taken in prohibiting theexport of &quot;The Nation,&quot; and decided to give it their full support.Mr. Seton Watson. 25. The War Cabinet had under consideration the case ofMr. Seton Watson, the authority on Serbian affairs, who was servingas a private in the -Royal Army Medical Corps, and whose service as an expert were required by the Information Department.The War Cabinet decided that Private Seton Watson should be attached for duty to theInformation Department.(Initialled) D.
