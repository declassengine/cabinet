THE War Cabinet decided that Lord Milner and Mr. Henderson should examine what progress has been made with the scheme of National Service, and what changes of method and organisation, if any, arenecessary in order to develop to the necessary extent the, national resources in man-power.EgyptianExpeditionaryForce :Instructions toGeneral OfficerCommanding.the2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theinstructions given to the Commander-in-Chief, Egyptian Expedi-tionary Force, in January last, were that his primary mission, afterthe occupation of Rafa, would be the defence of Egypt during the summer months and the preparation for an offensive campaign inPalestine during the autumn of 1917. Since then the situation had greatly changed, as a result of the successes in Mesopotamia and1365-109] B
Syria, and he therefore proposed to instruct General Sir A.. Murrayto develop his recent success to the fullest possible extent and toadopt a more offensive role in general.Home? 3. The War Cabinet were strongly of opinion that steps oughtto be taken to educate public opinion in this country in regard tothe history and potentialities of the countries, such as Mesopotamiaor Palestine, where victories have been or are likely to be achieved.Among suitable writers were mentioned Mr. A, E. Zimmern,Mr. Lovat Eraser, and Mr. Arnold Toynbee. The War cabinet decided that This work ought to come within the province of the Departmentof Information, which should, if necessary, organise aspecial branch for the purpose.The Prime Minister undertook to communicate with Mr. JohnBuchan on the subject.Prisoners of War:Their Employmentin the FightingZone.4. With reference to the decision of the Anglo-French Con-ference on the 13th March, 1917 (Paper I.C.-18a, p. 4), that wecould not accept the German proposal that prisoners of war shouldnot be employed within 30 kilom. of the firing line, the WarCabinet had under consideration telegram No. 287 from the british ambassador at Paris, dated the 29th March, 1917, which, though not quite clear, appeared to indicate an intention on the part of theFrench Government to reverse the above decision and accept theGerman proposal.In view of the fact that some 28,000 German prisoners of war are employed in rear of our lines and performing invaluable woi-kon the lines of communication, the War Cabinet were reluctant to concur in any concession to the German proposal.The Secretary of State for War undertook to look fully into thematter and to report to the War Cabinet.Italy :Visit of the Chiefof the ImperialGeneral Staff.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report by theChief of the Imperial General Staff, dated the 27th March, 1917(Paper G.T.-309), on the subject of his visit to Italian Headquarterson the 22nd-24th March, 1917. Special note was taken of general sir W. Robertson&apos;s remarks on the inadequacy of the higher command, due to the age of some of the Generals. The Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff considered that there was undoubtedly apossibility of a German attack on the Italian frontier, although therewere no immediate indications.The War Cabinet decided on the following action : (a.) A private and confidential telegram, replying to thevarious applications by the Italian Government, shouldbe sent to the British Ambassador in Rome, embodying the following Extracts from the criticisms in the Report of theChief of the Imperial General Staff.An offer to lend ten batteries of 6-inch howitzerswith their personnel.A suggestion that an application should be made tothe French for field guns.A draft of this despatch to be prepared by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and sent, in the first instance,for the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff.
83o(b.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to have a veryfrank discussion with the Italian Ambassador on thesubject.(c.) A letter to be sent to the Italian Government in reply totheir recent communication on the subject, to be drafted by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and sent to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs for despatch.Salonica.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a letter fromMr. Alfred Stead (Paper G.T.-249), who has for the last five monthsbeen A.D.C. to Vice-Admiral Troubridge, to the Prime Minister,dated the 12th March, 1917, which led to a discussion on the highermilitary command of the Salonica Force. There was some comment on the inactivity of the great Allied army based on Salonica and the bad effect which such continued inaction must exercise on the moral of the army.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested that the timemight not be far distant when shipping considerations might involvea reduction of the force.It was generally agreed that either the force should be diminished or much greater military activity should be displayed.The Prime Minister undertook to avail himself of theopportunity to discuss the question with M. Painleve.firstBelgium :Financial Positionof the BeliefCommission.The Shortage of paper.7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Blockade (Paper G-T.-238) on the FinancialPosition of the Commission for Relief in Belgium (Appendix I).Sir R. Chalmers stated that the Treasury view was in favour,firstly, of continuing to recognise the Belgian Government ratherthan the Relief Commission, the future of which was dubious ; and,secondly, and principally, that we should continue to divide theliability equally with the French Government. In regard to thefirst point, he stated that he had learned (semi-officially) that theBelgian Government were themselves anxious to avoid falling too much into the hands of the Belgian Relief Commission, especiallyafter the war.Attention was drawn to a statement attributed to Mr. Whitaker,who has been writing a series of articles in &quot; The Times &quot; recordinghis experiences in France and Germany, to the effect that there wereample supplies for the civil population in Belgium.Lord Robert Cecil stated, however, that this was not corroboratedby the information at his disposal. He undertook to see Mr.Whitaker.The War Cabinet, while recognising the impossibility of with-drawing from any obligations already entered into, were very reluctant to increase the contribution, particularly in view of the weakening of guarantees, due to the substitution of Dutch for american control.   They decided that The Minister of Blockade should consult the French Govern-ment as to the desirability of increasing the subsidy, andshould inform them that we could only agree to it on condition that the French Government paid half theincrease.The second point submitted, viz., the proposed arrangement with the Banque beige pour 1&apos;Etranger, was left for settlement between the Minister of Blockade and Sir Robert Chalmers.8. The War Minister had under consideration a Note by thePresident of the Board of Trade on the Shortage of Paper, togetherwith a return of stocks (Paper G.T.-271, Appendix II).
9. The War Cabinet authorised : The Board of Trade to prohibit the publication of new news-papers during the War, except under licence.(Initialled)      D. LI. &apos;G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 30, 1917.Prohibition of newNewspapers except under Licence.Sir Thomas Whittaker, the Chairman of the Royal Commissionon Paper, stated that, broadly speaking, the smaller newspapers ofthe country were very short of paper. The plan to which theCommission inclined was to insist that those papers which had verytlarge supplies should be refused their ration of paper until theywere reduced to three months&apos; supply, after which they would again be rationed. To this the papers with good supplies had replied thatthis was to penalise foresight, prudence, and economy. Against this itwas urged that it was a great hardship that the newspapers with theleast capital behind them should suffer because newspapers with supplies in stock for many months ahead were allowed to obtainstill further supplies in a seriously depleted market.The President of the Board of Trade stated thai the matter hadbeen brought before the War Cabinet for the reason that political considerations were involved.The War Cabinet decided that: For the present there should be no interference in the suppliesOf paper, bxit that a warning should be given to thosenewspapers that have large stocks to the effect that theGovernment may have to interfere, and that suchnewspapers should themselves take some action to preventthe extinction of old-established newspapers.
APPENDIX I.G-.T.-238. --Financial Position of the Commission for Relief in Belgium1. THE Commission for Relief in Belgium has, since April 1915, beenfinanced by a subsidy paid to them monthly, by the Belgian Government out of theAnglo-French Loan.   Russia bears, nominally, a third share in this loan.2. From April 1915 to October 1916 the subsidy was 1,000,000Z. a month. from november 1916, inclusive, it has been increased to .l,n00,000Z. a month.*3. At the time when this increase was approved, at the end of October last, theCommission had applied for authority to increase also the programme of imports intothe occupied territories owing to increased destitution, and to meet this increase theyhad asked for an increase of the subsidy up to 2,00O,O0OZ. a month. The increase ofthe programme was approved, but the subsidy was only increased to 1,500,000Z. amonth. As anticipated by the Commission, the pressure of the Belgian Governmenthas obliged it to carry out the whole of the increased programme, while the subsidygiven to it has been at least 50O,0O0Z. too little. The Commission has, in consequence,only been able to continue its work by making heavy drafts on its working capital.4. In view of this situation, the French Government proposed in December thata relief loan should be raised in the United States. This proposal was strongly supported by the Commission, but, for various reasons, the Treasury considered itnecessary to delay action until the end of January. The uncertainty of the Commission^position following the rupture between the United States and Germany then made itnecessary to suspend consideration of the scheme.5. The Commission has now supplied figures showing not only that the increaseof the subsidy granted at the end of October was at that time insufficient to meet theincreased programme of imports, but also that the subsequent rise in prices has made it impossible now to maintain that programme at less than a monthly expenditure of2,500,0001. The Commission has therefore asked for an increase of the subsidy tothis figure. The Belgian Government strongly support this request, but fromcommunications which have passed between the Commission and the FrenchGovernment, it would appear that the latter object to making themselves responsiblefor a share in this increase. The French Government are, of course, bearing the whole burden of the relief in Northern France, for which they give the Commission a subsidy of 36,000,000 fr. a month, and they also doubtless attribute the present financial difficulties to what they regard as our obstruction of the relief loan project. TheTreasury agrees in principle to some increase, but considers the increase asked for too large, and suggests an exchange of views with the French Government. The attitudeof that Government being as stated above, any such exchange of views would belengthy and possibly recriminatory. The Commission states that unless an increaseof approximately the amount asked for is granted soon they must cut down their programme. On the basis of the present subsidy, they estimate the necessaryreduction at 40 per cent.6. The Commission has recently proposed that, as a temporary modus vivendipending a consideration of the increase of the subsidy, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould guarantee a credit in its favour with the Banque beige pour 1&apos;Etranger inLondon of 1,370,000Z. the sum reqvrired to protect its European commitments for march. The Treasury objects to this idea on two grounds : first, because it wouldinvolve entering into direct financial relations with the Commission, whereas allprevious relations have been conducted through the Belgian Government; and secondly, because this guarantee would cover the expenses of the Commission in respectof imports, not only into Belgium, but also into Northern France, for which HisMajesty&apos;s Government have not yet assumed any liability. Against this, the Commissionpoint out that the Belgian Government subsidy, even on the present basis, would bring them in 1,500,000Z. in March, that therefore nothing beyond the mere guarantee ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government is required, and that this guarantee is only required tomeet the uncertainty felt by contractors at the present moment as to the Commission^future.7. Any reduction in the Commission^ programme would be disastrous to the moral of the French and Belgian Governments. There is no reason of policy againstentering into direct financial relations with the Commission, but rather the contrary.* The subsidy is really slightly less than this, half being paid in francs at Paris at the rate of 25 fr. to the /.
The only financial reason against it is that, whereas at present all grants to theCommission are made out of the joint loan to the Belgian Government, any directadvance made by us to the Commission would be a departure from the principle thatthe three Allied Governments should jointly bear the burden of all relief expenditureon Belgian account. It is submitted that the question is one of urgency and of highpolicy, not altogether to be settled by an appeal to such considerations.8. On the other hand, the United States should certainly contribute very largely to the work of the Commission from henceforward. With this object a, telegram hasbeen sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington instructing him to point outthat the Commission ought to find at least 500,000Z. a month in the United States.9. It is submitted that we should (a.) Inform the Belgian Government at once that they may increase the subsidy to the Relief Commission to the sum of 2,000,000Z. a month if and whenneeded. We should then inform the French Government of our action and ask them to bear half of this increase. If they refuse, we must make up our mind to bear it ourselves for the present.(6.) Guarantee a credit in the Commission^ favour with the Banque beige pour1&apos;Etranger of 1,370,000Z.R. C.APPENDIX II.G.T.-271.---Note by the President of the Board of Trade on Shortage of Paper, withReturn of Stocks.THE Royal Commission on Paper has taken a census of the stocks of paper heldon behalf of the newspapers in this country, and I attach figures summarising theresult of the census. They do not disclose any accumulation of stocks to the extent which has been suggested in certain quarters.Since these figures have been available I have met a representative deputation ofnewspaper proprietors, and I think it may be taken that they were unanimously of theopinion that, short of an actual famine in paper, they were opposed to any interferencewith stocks or with the machinery by which each firm obtains its supplies. It isnecessary, however, to face the fact that there may be great stringency as regardssupplies of paper in the near future, and 1 think that the War Cabinet should have aknowledge of the position. I have not given any reply to the deputation, and should like to discuss this matter with the War Cabinet before doing so.(Initialled) A. H.
