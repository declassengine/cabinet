The Western Front,Salonica.Shipping Losses.Submarines.Bombardment ofKavalla.1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he had nothing of special interest to report in regard to the situation in thevarious theatres of war. He proposed, however, to refer to theoperations on the Western front at the Meeting of the War Cabinetthe following morning, when the Secretary of State for War wouldbe present.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that duringthe previous week&apos;s fighting on the Salonica front the losses of theItalian forces had been 2,400 as compared with 1,700 casualtiessustained by the French, who had eight divisions in that theatre.3. The First Sea Lord made his usual report on mercantile shipping losses.In response to an enquiry as to how the latest figures of British,Ally, and Neutral losses compared with those of preceding weeks, he undertook to prepare for the War Cabinet a brief comparative state-ment giving the required information. The general position he regarded as being, for the moment, more reassuring.4. The First Sea Lord reported a number of engagementsbetween British destroyers and other ships with enemy submarines,which, in certain instances, had been attended, he was inclined tobelieve, with successful results.5. The First Sea Lord stated that British monitors had recentlybombarded the port of Kavalla, destroying various suspectedbuildings, but otherwise inflicting no damage on the town itself.Timber Supplies. 6- With reference to War Cabinet 133, Minute 7, the WarCabinet took note of the decision reached by Lord Curzon, in con-sultation with the Secretary of State for War and the President ofthe Board of Trade, that the control of timber supplies should betransferred from the War Office to the Board of Trade, and that theappointment of the Controller under the new arrangements shouldbe left to the President of the Board of Trade.Parcels for Troofls 7. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thein France. / Secretary of State for War, dated the 19th May, 1917 (paper g.T.-7; 0), stating that the Army Council recommended that it wasnot necessary to place any restrictions on the despatch of parcelscontaining breadstuffs to the troops in France, or on the sale ofbreadstuffs in canteens in France, as the amounts involved wereinconsiderable ; and that, further, such restrictions were inadvisable,as this course would be considered harsh, and would be unpopular athome.The War Cabinet approved this recommendation, and decidedthat-There should be no interference with the present arrangementsuntil the situation in regard to foodstuffs in this countryrendered such intervention absolutely necessary.[This cancels the previous decision of the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 3rd May, 1917 (War Cabinet, 131, Minute 6) wlilchwas taken on the recommendation of the Secretary of Statefor War (G.T.-581).]Parcels for prisoners of War,8. The War Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for War, dated the 19th May, 1917 (Paper G.T.-769),stating that, in the opinion of the Army Council, the number and
(j^l weight of parcels sent to officers should be limited, and that suchparcels should be subjected to the same censorship as that which is applied to parcels sent to other ranks.The War Cabinet arjproved the above recommendation of theArmy Council.Propaganda at 9. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum, dated theHome. 18th May, 1917, by the Director of the Department of Informationof the Foreign Office (Paper G.T.-774), stating that, in the present state of popular feeling, it was very important that a considerableamount of propaganda should be undertaken in Great Britain itself, and asking for the authority of the War Cabinet for the organisation ofvarious lines of direct propaganda in the United Kingdom, and, inparticular, of a series of lectures and addresses to be given in all theprincipal centres.The War Cabinet approved  the  proposal in principle, and decided that The Director of the Department of Information should beauthorised to make the necessary arrangements for theconduct of such propaganda, and that he should place himself in communication with the Treasury officials inregard to the allotment of the necessary funds.pe ro] 10. The War Cabinet took note of the serious situation in reference to the supply of petrol in this country, having regard tothe difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies and the increasing demands for petrol by the naval and military authorities (PapersG.T.-675 and G.T.-707).The War Cabinet decided that  The Secretary of State for the Colonies should be asked toexamine at once the whole question, and to decide betweenthe conflicting recpuirements of the various Departmentsconcerned, and that lie should report to the War Cabinetin due course the decision he reached.Salonica and 11. A discussion on the general situation at Salonica and in greece. Greece took place, arising out of two Memoranda (Appendix I),submitted by the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, raising the question of the arrangements for thefurther withdrawal of troops after the first infantry division and twocavalry brigades had been evacuated.The main points discussed were the extent to which thereduction of the force and the consequent withdrawal from the struma front would necessitate the abandonment of the Monastirfront as well, and the degree to which the whole policy in Greecewas now left in French hands. On the former point the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet- that he hadreceived unofficially a copy of a communication prepared by general petain in which the latter took the view that it was impossible towithdraw from Macedonia until the position in Greece had been secured by the occupation of Thessaly, and, if necessary, also by sending troops to Athens.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that thewithdrawal was a matter of imperative naval necessity, irrespective of any conditions. It would, however, take some time, and it wasconceivable that the Bulgarians would not attempt to follow up our withdrawal from the Struma actively, and that in that case theMonastir front might not inconceivably beheld. This would be moreparticularly the case if the Venizelist forces were increased.
On the latter question it was argued that we ought to make it jvclear to the French Government that, though we had agreed to theirtaking the leading role in Greece, the policy for the carrying out of   %which they would be responsible would be an Allied policy and nota purely French policy.The War Cabinet instructed *The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to take an early opportunity of discussing with General Foch the arrange-ments for the withdrawal of the next contingent of troops from Salonica, and to report the result to the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet further decided that The Italian Government should be informed of the decisionarrived at when it was settled as between the twoGovernments.The War Cabinet further decided that It was not necessary to furnish any explanation to the SerbianGovernment pending the arrival of xAdmiral Tioubridge(War Cabinet 141, Minute 14).The United States 12. The War  Cabinet   discussed a telegram  received from and Japan. Mr. Balfour  (Appendix II)  conveying a suggestion that if theUnited States were to build more destroyers in the place of some ofthe capital ships on their present programme, we should guarantee to replace those capital ships in the case of any attack upon theUnited States by a third party, and that this guarantee might eventually be developed into a general defensive Naval alliance between the two Powers. As the Power wdiich the United Statesfeared most was Japan, the proposed guarantee or the Alliance would,raise the whole question of our relations with Japan.Lord Robert Cecil explained that it might be possible to gainJapanese assent to our alliance with the United States either by adopting Lord Grey&apos;s policy of giving Japan a free hand over thewhole of China (wdiich he personally strongly deprecated as involvingserious dangers in future to India and to our position generally), orby giving her a free hand in a definite sphere in a portion of China,i.e., Manchuria and Shantting. It might also be possible to induce Japan to come into a Triple Alliance with ourselves and theUnited States, on the basis of American assent to the suggestedJapanese sphere of influence in China. Personally he was inclined,at the moment, not to go further than explaining to the Japanesethat we were giving this guarantee in order to secure the necessarydestroyers, and reassuring them that we would certainly not lendthem to the United States for the purpose of an attack upon Japan.But he was informed that the Japanese would not be content withsuch an explanation, and would regard the agreement as involvingin fact a general Anglo-American Alliance affecting the situation inthe Far East, and interfering with Japan&apos;s ambitions in China.In the course of a general discussion it was urged that it wouldbe very inadvisable to do anything at the present stage of the war that could give the Japanese any justifiable ground for alarm orsuspicion, and so upset the present position in the Pacific. This. view was endorsed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, whopointed out that Australia and New Zealand, which had originallyassented with some reluctance to the Japanese request for our support in the matter of the Pacific islands north of the Equator,were now satisfied both with the arrangement and with the general attitude of Japan, and would no doubt be seriously disturbed byanything that would endanger the safety of the Pacific.
It was also urged that it by no means followed, from thesuggestion confidentially made to Mr. Balfour, that the AmericanSenate would endorse anything in the nature of an Anglo-american naval Alliance, and that consequently there was a danger of ourupsetting existing relations with Japan without securing anythingtangible from the United States.The First Sea Lord further suggested that the proposed guarantee might, as a matter of fact, not really be necessary, as hewas by no means certain that, for the purposes of a war with Japan,the United States were not really more in need of additionaldestroyers than of further capital ships.The War Cabinet approved the telegram already sent in replyto that from Mr. Balfour, and directed a further telegram in the same sense to be sent.The First Sea Lord was also instructed to furnish a detailed examination of the probable requirements of the UnitedStates in the matter of capital ships or destroyers in the contingency of a war with Japan, for communication toMr. Balfour, in order to convince the United StatesGovernment that destroyers would be of more use to them than capital ships in any war with Japan.imperial WarCabinetDocuments :The Question of1!Sending toAustralia..13. The War Cabinet discussed the question of communicatingImperial War Cabinet documents to the Prime Minister of theAustralian Commonwealth (Paper G.T.-741) (Appendix III).The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that theother Prime Ministers had each taken away a set of the paperssupplied to them during the Session of the Imperial War Cabinet,taking special precautions for their destruction in case of emergency.Mr. Hughes was therefore in a position, relative to the other PrimeMinisters, of complete ignorance as to the Imperial situation,it had been before those Ministers. This might possibly beMassey visited Mr. Hughes on his return journeymatters with regard to which Mr. Hughes was leftMr. Huo-hes were coming over soon he couldasawkward if Mr.and spoke aboutuninformed. If ivir. nuo-nes were coming over soon ne couia seethe papers here, but his plans were uncertain, and if he were notcoming over he might be offended if he did not receive the papers.The Secretary of State for the Colonies had some doubts whether a prime Minister who was absent from the Cabinet Session shouldhave the papers circulated to him, and, in view of the fact that theImperial Cabinet was being established as a permanent institution,that point would have to be considered. After some hesitation, inview of the possible risks run, he had been prepared to suggestsending the documents out in charge of a special messenger.A general discussion followed, chiefly as to the extent of riskincurred in sending the documents oversea.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary of State for the Colonies to send a telegram tothe Prime Minister of the Australian Commonwealthexpressing the view of the War Cabinet that he ought tosee the documents in question, but laying stress on the considerable risk involved in sending them to Australia,and suggesting that, if he were thinking of coming overto this country in the near future, the documents might bekept here pending his arrival.^   Conscientious 14. The war Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum,Objectors. dated  the 9th May,  1917, by  Lord  Milner   (Paper G.T.-677)(Appendix IV), pointing out that the late Government had decidedthat provision should be made for the exemption from military service
of those whose convictions prevented them from taking a directpart in the war ; that the provisions of the Military Service Act,1916, were so framed that Tribunals were given the option of granting either absolute or conditional exemption as the circum-stances of each case might demand ; and that the objects of the saidGovernment were presumably (a.) To give relief to those who had genuine convictions, and thereby incidentally to prevent the possibility of anoutcry against religious persecution ;(b.) To prevent the shirker from obtaining a refuge under a&quot; conscience &quot; acquired since the outbreak of war.The Memorandum further suggested that, as the Act was atpresent administered, the intentions of those who framed it were not fully or equitably carried out, and that there were a number of caseswhere religious and moral convictions were patently genuine in whichexemption had not been granted. The Memorandum advocated agreater elasticity of administration.The Director of Personal Services stated that conscientious objectors might generally be classed in two categories : 1. The absolutists, who declined in any circumstances to performcompulsory work of any kind, whether of a Military or civil nature ;2. The alternativists, who were opposed to the shedding of blood, but were prepared to perform substituted service.The absolutists, again, presented two types: those who adoptedan attitude of resistance to every attempt to make them work,and those who not only refused to undertake any service forthe State, but were increasingly busy in their endeavours to inducetheir fellow-citizens to defy the Government. This latter class were working in close co-operation with the Union of Democratic Control,the No Conscription Fellowship, and other bodies whose activities,in time of war, were unpatriotic and dangerous. Such men,if they were released by the Military Authorities, would haveimmediately to be imprisoned under the Defence of the Realm Act.With reference to the suggestion that really genuine cases should be released on medical grounds, as otherwise, should anyobjector die in prison, he might be regarded as a martyr and publicopinion be stirred in a high degree against the Government, GeneralChilds said that in the existing &quot;low category&quot; of physical fitnessfor Military Service this would not be feasible ; while it was further suggested that, in the present admirable conditions of prison life,there was no reason to apprehend any such fatality.In the discussion which ensued it was pointed out (a.) That Lord Sandhurst had been incorrectly reported byHansard when he was said to have stated that certainmen would be discharged from the Army ; the wordsactually used by him were, &quot; to the Army&quot; ;(6.) That men imprisoned at Oartmoor are granted conditionalpardon, i.e., they are released provided they agree to dowork of a non-military character ;(c.) That in practice it was impossible to draw the line betweengenuine and fictitious cases;(d.) That it would be difficult for the War Office to dischargefrom, the Army men who had been placed there byParliament;(e.) That there was a growing body of public opinion which was becoming very impatient with the lenient treatmentaccorded to those particular objectors who were actuatedby no religious motives and whose lack of patriotism andcontempt of authority had estranged the sympathies oftheir fellow-countrymen.
The Home Secretary concurred in the view of General Childs,that whereas religious objectors were generally harmless, if abnormal,political objectors were often dangerous propagandists and their conduct in work centres constituted a grave scandal. He said thatthe regime of the Governor of Dartmoor Prison had beenunexpectedly lenient, and that the Home Office rules were beingrevised with a view to the adoption of stricter measures in cases which demanded them.In the course of the discussion a letter from the Lord chancellor to Lord Milner was read, in which Lord Finlay stated that the wording of the first Military Service Act of 1916 created in many quarters the impression that the only exemption on the ground of.conscientious objection was to be in respect of combatant service, butthe second Act of the same year made it clear that there was power in respect of conscientious objection to grant a certificate of absoluteexemption, i.e., of exemption from all kinds of military service. Inthe Lord Chancellors opinion the Acts, read together, made it clearthat the local Tribunal, if they consider the grounds of the applica-tion established, is bound to grant a certificate of absolute exemption.The latter further stated that it could never have been intended that genuine conscientious objectors who refused substituted service should continue to undergo sentences of hard labour as long as theMilitary Service Acts remained in force. In his opinion such acondition of things would have a very unhappy effect in supplyingmaterial for agitation against the Act. He suggested that it mightbe possible for the certificates of such men to be reviewed with aview to their being made absolute, or, alternatively, that the men should be transferred to the reserve, in some section in which, whilelegally liable to serve, they would not in practice be called upon todo so.It was suggested that no decision should be taken until afurther and fuller enquiry had been instituted.The War Cabinet, after careful consideration, decided, lord milner dissenting, that The case for further enquiry had not been established, and that,in the circumstances, no action on their part w^as necessary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W.,May 22,
APPENDIX I.G.T.-755. -The Secretary, War Cabinet,THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff and I would like the attached papers onthe reduction of forces at Salonica and other matter discussed at the recent Conferencein Paris brought to the notice of the War Cabinet at the earliest possible moment.(Signed) J. R. JELLICOE.May 18, 1917.I.Memorandum by the First Sea Lord.I desire to direct the attention of the War Cabinet to the urgent necessity of informing the French Government that we have no intention of abandoning our proposals for the immediate reduction of the force at Salonica. In the reply of theFrench Government, dated the 11th instant, to the memorandum left with the FrenchWar Cabinet at the Paris Conference, the difficulties of the shipping position, which arethe fundamental basis of our proposals for the reduction of the Salohica force, are entirelyignored, and the whole question is side-tracked by bringing into prominence the militaryand political difficulties that will follow reduction or withdrawal. The War Cabinet, in arriving at these conclusions, was of course fully aware of these difficulties, andnothing but absolute necessity would have forced the Cabinet into making the proposals.To start again at the beginning, and to discuss once more the results that would followreduction o\ withdrawal, is simply to work round in a circle ; and, seeing that therecent slight decrease in shipping losses, even if continued, will not make it possible tomaintain the line of communication to Salonica or to guard it efficiently, I urge theCabinet to inform the French Government that it is necessary that a decision should bereached, not later than the 1st June, as to whether the next group of troops to be withdrawn shall come from the British or the French army ; and that, if by that date the French Government has not signified its intention of withdrawing a division, assoon as the first withdrawal of British troops has been completed, an arrangement willat once be made to withdraw a second British division as soon as the shipping utilisedin the first withdrawal is available. Had I seen the reply of the British Governmentto the French Government before its despatch I would have suggested making an.answer in the above sense.(Signed) J. Pi. JELLICOE.May 18, 1917II.Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.I agree with the views and proposals of the Chief of the Naval Staff, and havealready told the War Cabinet that I consider the French communication to be most unsatisfactory.Paragraph 1 of the resolutions tabled by the Prime Minister distinctly embodiedthe &quot; principle&quot; of reducing the troops to a number sufficient to hold Salonica, whereas the French reply leaves the question still open, although the British and French naval authorities agreed at the Conference that the force may be starved if not withdrawn,while the British and French military authorities agreed that no military object is served by holding Salonica. The only question left open by the Prime Minister wasthe method of withdrawal.The difficulties of withdrawing, or even of reducing, the force are fully realised,and they are by no means solely political. There are also grave naval and militarydifficulties and dangers. But they must be faced, or we may incur a great disaster..We can only do our best to minimise the consequences of an enterprise which has been thoroughly unsound from the commencement.
APPENDIX II.Sir G. Spring-Rice to Lord Robert Cecil. (Received May 15.)(Paraphrase).(No.       .   Secret.)(Telegraphic.)   K. Washington, May 14, 1917.Mr. BALFOUR wishes the following to be shown to the Prime Minister : &quot; Large United States programme for capital ships makes construction of any considerable number of additional destroyers impossible. We have suggested abandon-ment for the present of capital ships, but fear of Japan is so great, both in the navy department and elsewhere, that we have made no progress. In discussion with colonel House yesterday latter suggested that programme might be modified indirection we desire if United States could receive a guarantee from us that if necessityarose they could call on us for assistance in capital ships to a not less extent thannumber which would have been completed under present programme. Danger towhich United Kingdom might be exposed in such conditions from German fleet waspointed out to him. He then developed the idea, and suggested arrangement might take a wider form and be mutual; in short, a defensive alliance on the sea between united States and ourselves. He was in favour of a secret agreement on these lines,but I doubt whether this is consistent with United States constitution, and, in anycase, it is a violent departure from United States practice.&quot; If, however, you agree to general principle, I would consult him as to best method of carrying it out. Personally I consider that, apart from all-important needfor more destroyers, there would be a great advantage in obtaining anything in thenature of a defensive alliance with United States. Of course Japan&apos;s susceptibilitieswill have to be spared, but this should not be difficult to manage.&quot;APPENDIX III.G.T.-741.-- .Imperial War Cabinet.The Question of Communicating Documents to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealthof Australia.(Note by the Secretary.)INSTRUCTIONS are requested from the War Cabinet as to what Imperial WarCabinet documents, if any, should be transmitted to the Prime Minister of theCommonwealth of AustraliaNo resolution was passed by the Imperial War Cabinet itself on this question, andthere is, therefore, no absolute obligation in the matter.It must be remembered, however, that the Prime Ministers of each of the self-governing Dominions represented at the Imperial War Cabinet have taken aAvay withthem the whole of the documents prepared in connection with the meetings. ThesePrime Ministers, therefore, will be at a considerable advantage compared withMr. Hughes if he is not also sent a complete set of the papers.[1365-142] DI wish to add that, had I seen our reply of the 12th instant before despatch, Iwould have proposed drawing attention also to the omission of any reference to thefinal resolution in regard to the Western front. I think the omission may not hewithout significance.(Signed) W. R. ROBERTSON. C.I.G.S.May 18, 1917.
* I discussed the whole question with the Secretary of State for the Colonies thismorning, and he rather inclined to the view that, on the whole, it would he best to sendMr. Hughes a complete set of the papers, although he pointed out that, in order toensure their safety, it would be necessary to send a special messenger with leadedboxes, &amp;c, such as were supplied to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions, and withspecial instructions as to how to act in the event of his ship being apprehended by theenemy.(Signed)      M. P. A. HANKEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 17, 1917.APPENDIX IV.G.T.-677. --Conscientious Objectors.(Memorandum by Lord Milner.)I AM not at all easy in my mind as to our attitude towards conscientious objectors. It is qirite clear that the late Government foresaw the difficulties whichwould arise in this connection, and it is equally clear that they decided that provision should be made for the exemption from military service of those whose convictionsprevented them from taking a direct part in the war. Moreover, it was obvious fromthe first that amongst the group of conscientious objectors there would be someextremists who would go to the length of refusing any substituted service in lieu ofservice in the ranks. The provisions of &quot;The Military Service Act, 1916,&quot; were therefore so framed that tribunals were given the option of granting either absoluteor conditional exemption as the circumstamces of each case might demand. Indeed,the importance which the Government attached to the power of granting absoluteexemption in certain cases is shown by the fact that a special explanatory clause was introduced into the second Military Service Act of 1916 in order to clear up amisapprehension which appeared to exist on this point in the minds of manj- of thosewho had to administer the Act.Whether this policy was wise .or unwise it is not my purpose to enquire. I ammerely concerned with the question as to whether the administration of the Acts hasin fact achieved the objects which the Government had in view. Those objects werepresumably twofold : 1. To give relief to those who had genuine convictions, and thereby incidentallyto prevent the possibility of an outcry against religious persecutions.2. To prevent the shirker from obtaining a refuge under a &quot; conscience&quot; acquiredsince the outbreak of war.I must confess that I have serious misgivings as to whether either of these objectshas in fact been achieved. As regards the first, we are allowing it to be said, withsome show of justice, that we are meting out unduly harsh treatment to those whosereligious feelings are so strong that they cannot even accept substituted service. Asregards the second, there is a growing outcry against the leniency with which we aretreating those whose consciences are sufficiently elastic to allow of the acceptance ofjueh service. And yet if shirkers are suspected it is surely in the ranks of the latterthat they are most likely to be found. It is they who have chosen to avail themselves of the amenities of Dartmoor in preference to the trenches; whereas in the case ofthose who have refused substituted service the choice has in many cases been in favourof hard labour, not as against the trenches, but as against a life of comparative ease onDartmoor or elsewhere. In a word, we appear to have succeeded in making the worst of both worlds. We have neither obtained credit for our endeavour to meet the caseof genuine religious conviction, nor have we escaped the charge that we are treatingtoo kindly those whose genuineness is more open to doubt.I will frankly admit that my attention was first drawn to this question by anecessity which lay upon me to enquire into the case of an individual who has been well known to me for many yenrs. The man in question became quite early in life adisciple of Tolstoi, and as the result of his views on the question of private property he
refused to inherit his father&apos;s estate. Several years before the war he became a Quakerand lived in a working-class tenement in order to carry on his work amongst the poor.But for the fact that the Quakers do not recognise any ministry he would quiteobviously have come within the category of ministers of religion recognised as suchunder the Military Service Acts. He is also, incidentally, quite unfit for active service,The history of this man&apos;s case is as follows : He appeared before the HoxtonTribunal and was refused absolute exemption. He stated that his religious beliefsprevented him from accepting any form of substituted service. He was arrested and taken under military escort to his unit. He was then court-martialled for refusing toput on uniform, and sentenced to six months&apos; hard labour. Here he contractedrheumatism, and the Home Office endeavoured to induce the War Office to dischargehim on the prison doctor&apos;s certificate. The War Office, however, insisted on their ownmedical examination, which the prisoner refused. On leaving prison after the com-pletion of his sentence, he was immediately re-arrested and again sent to his unit. Onagain refusing to wear uniform he was again court-martialled, and was sentenced to twoyears&apos; hard labour. On conrpletion of this second term he will, if the Military service acts are still in force, be re-arrested, and the process will continue ad infinitum.Whatever else may be said about this man&apos;s convictions, it is clear that they arepatently genuine. It is also clear that the provision allowing absolute exemption was intended to meet just such a case as this. I am informed on reliable authority thatthere are a large number of cases of the same kind. I submit that we are merelysowing the seeds of future trouble by allowing the Acts to be administered in a way which directly defeats the object of those who framed them. All that appears to berequired is a greater elasticity of administration. Many of these cases could be suitablydisposed of under the King&apos;s pardon, whereas in others discharge could probably begranted on medical grounds.(Initialled) M.May 9, 1917.
