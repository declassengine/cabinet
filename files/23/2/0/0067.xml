Naval and Military Advisers of the British and French Governments,who had held a Joint Conference on the previous evening to examine,from the Naval and Military points of view, the French and british proposals as regards Greece (War Cabinet 148) (the memorandum prepared by this Conference is shown in Appendix I), and to decideupon the proposals to be laid before the Anglo-French Conference,meeting later in the day, as representing the policy of the BritishGovernment.2. In regard to the measures to be adopted to obtain controlof the Thessalian crops, it appeared during the discussion thatM. Painleve had, in conversation with the Prime Minister and lord milner, acquiesced in the suggestion that these operations shouldbe carried out by the British force instead of by the French, ashad been previously arranged. The reason for the substitution of British for French troops for the execution of this duty, thenecessity for which was most strongly impressed on the WarCabinet by Lord Robert Cecil, was that it would give a verymuch better chance of avoiding friction, and possibly eventual[1365-149]
military operations against the Greeks.   The War Cabinet agreedthat the work of obtaining control of the crops, which wa? in reality tantamount to an act of war, though it was not intended to   r&apos;.\be carried out as a military operation, would probably be more   ^&apos;successfully executed, from the point of view of maintaining peace, *by British troops acting under British officers, their opinion in thismatter being, to a great extent, guided by the estimate of general sarrail&apos;s character gathered from his previous actions. It alsoseemed obvious that this operation, which was an endeavour toobtain a pacific solution of the Greek question, should be carried outby the troops of the nation who pressed for it and believed in it. Itwas pointed out, however, by the Secretary of State for War and theChief of the Imperial General Staff that there were serious militaryobjections to the work being undertaken by the British forces at salonica, the chief of these being that arrangements for doing socould not be made at a momeut&apos;s notice, and might, indeed, takeweeks, whilst the necessities of the case called for action within afew days, and that the necessary preparations would probably entail the disorganisation of the British forces.3. The validity of the military objections was accepted by theWar Cabinet, and it was realised that, in the circumstances, theprospects of a peaceful solution might be safeguarded by the issue to General Sarrail of strict injunctions on the line to be adopted.The War Cabinet decided that The operations of obtaining control of the Thessalian crops andof their distribution should, as had been previouslyarranged, be entrusted to General Sarrail, and that formaland categorical instructions should he issued to him by theFrench Government to carry out the matter as amicably aspossible and with the least possible provocation.4. The point was discussed whether, if the course outlinedshould lead to war with Greece, the British Government shoulddissociate themselves beforehand from taking part in the militaryoperations entailed, and should warn the French Government that,owing to the shipping factor, the British Government were not in aposition to co-operate with the French in war against Greece. Itwas pointed out, on the other hand, that such an avowal would havethe worst effect on the French, in spite of the fact that M. Ribot had,in reference to the operations in Egypt, informed the Prime minister that, in case of any serious military operations in that area, theFrench would dissociate themselves from British action ; and it was realised that definitely to lay down such a course of abstention withthe French, who, after all, were our Allies, would be inadvisable ifnot impossible.5. After discussion on various points, the War Cabinet decidedthat the following should be the British proposals to be laid beforethe Second Session of the Anglo-French Conference which was tobe held that day : (1.) That the establishment of the posts in Thessaly necessary toobtain control of the harvest should be undertaken bythe French under General Sarrail, who should receiveinstructions in. advance to use his utmost efforts tomaintain peace.(2.) That General Sarrail should, in case of necessity, have allpreparations made for military action, as had   been-   suggested by the French, on the Isthmus of Corinth.
(3.) That, so soon as the military posts in Thessaly had beenestablished, a demand for abdication should be presented to King Constantine.-  (4.) That, if the King declined to abdicate, Greece should beblockaded by sea, and the Royalist section cut off from being supplied from Thessaly.  -(5.) That, if the King should attempt to move troops out of theMorea, or otherwise to take military action against theAllies, General Sarrail should at once take steps to landa force on the Isthmus of Corinth.(6.) That all negotiations in the matter on the part of the allies should be entrusted to M.  Jonnart, who should   be invested with full powers.(7.) That, in regard to the decrease of the garrison of Salonica,no further reduction should be made for sis weeks afterthe 1st June,  1917, and that a further consultation between the French and British Governments on thissubject should be held on the 1st July.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 29, 1917.[t\t.o.
APPENDIX.Conference of Naval and Military Advisers of the British and French Governments,May 28, 1917.Present:General P. Focli,General Sir W. Robertson,Admiral Sir J. Jellicoe,Admiral Le Bon,General Weygand,Major-General Sir G. Macdonogh,Major-General F. Maurice,to consider the following questions : (a.) The object of the British Government is to avoid fighting with the Greeks.They wish the harvest in Thessaly to be controlled by peaceful means, andthey would like to be informed how far, from a military point of view, this could be done.(b.) It is clear that an occupation of the Isthmus of Corinth is at first sight a hostile operation, and they would like to know exactly what this wouldinvolve.1. The Conference is of opinion that for the control of the harvest in Thessaly by peaceful means it will be necessary to establish posts on the railways, roads, and otherroutes by which the harvest might be exported ; that the disposition and strength ofthfise posts can only be decided exactly by the Commander on the spot, but, as ageneral estimate, the Conference considers that a force of about 2,000 men should suffice to occupy the posts.General Foch considered it indispensable that these posts should have adequatesupports behind them, and he considers, therefore, that the whole force in Thessalyshould not be less than one division. He added that the stronger the force the lesschance there would be of a conflict. It will also be necessary in his opinion to preventthe Greek forces in the Morea from escaping, and therefore to occupy the Isthmus ofCorinth.2. Should these peaceful measures fail and the Governments decide to employforce in order to secure the harvest, it will be necessary, in the opinion of theConference, to be ready to support the division in Thessaly and that in the Isthmus ofCorinth by other troops immediately.In the event of military operations having to be undertaken the naval blockadeshould be increased to the utmost. How far this will be effective in overcoming oppositiondepends on the amount of foodstuffs which are now in Greece, and as to this theConference has no exact information.3. General Foch is of opinion that the landing of a force at the Isthmus of Corinthis not more an act of war than the entry of Allied troops into Thessaly, and that, in any event, one division should be landed at the Isthmus simultaneously with the despatchof the division to Thessaly. Further, it is necessary to be prepared to support theCorinth division, in the event of opposition, by a second division. The french authorities state that they have information that it is possible to land and maintainthe first troops required on this Isthmus. The landing of the remainder will bedecided according to circumstances, and they can be landed between the Isthmus andthe Piraeus inclusive. The British authorities are unable to express an opinion as tolanding on the coast without a reconnaissance of the locality. The British naval authorities state that they are unable to give any naval or shipping assistance of any sort in the transport of these two divisions.4. General Foch desires to add that the French Government state that theycannot consent to any reduction of the Allied forces at Salonica beyond the two Britishcavalry brigades and one division now under orders until the operations discussedabove have been completed and the Greek question settled.
