Swinton, C.B., D.S.O., Assistant Secretary.Sweden.1. THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a letterfrom Lord Robert Cecil (Appendix I), pointing out the dangerous and reactionary tendencies of i*ecent Swedish political changes.Mr. Balfour rather inclined to the view that the adverse featurementioned in Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s letter might be counterbalancedto a certain extent by the good effects of the announcement of aFinnish Constitution : The War Cabinet were unable to suggest any action at thepresent stage,^beyond keeping careful observation on thesituation in Sweden.
Mesopotamia. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, in therecent action on the Diala Eiver, our forces had sustained totalcasualties of 450, including 48 killed. &apos;.!he British troops were now about 40 miles from Khanikin, and the Russians, having capturedthe important Miantak Pass, were about 50 miles from that place.He anticipated, owing to the slow rate of advance of the Russians,that the Turkish force retiring in front of them would probablyescape ; they were, however, known to be short of supplies andwould probably be glad to&apos;escape northwards.Egypt. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave, the full detailsof the battle on the 26th-28th March between the British force andthe Turks near Gaza, the greater part of which were to bepublished. The objectives had been Gaza and Wadi-el-Ghuzze, inorder to prevent the Turks escaping without being brought to action ; and, if possible, to seize Gaza by a coup de main. our losses had amounted to 47 officers and 350 men killed, 2,900 of all ranks wounded, and about 200 missing.resolutions by the 5. The War Cabinet had before them certain resolutions onBoard of Trade.        the question of the control of export and import trade after the War(Appendix II), which the President of the Board of Trade proposed,on behalf of the British Government, to lay before the imperial war Conference that afternoon.Having regard to the very short time that they had had attheir disposal for the study of the questions involved, the WarCabinet decided that (a.) These, resolutions should not be presented to the imperial war Conference until the members of the War cabinet had had further time for their consideration, and thatthe action in the matter of the Imperial War Conferencesitting in the afternoon (2nd April) should be limited to discussion;(b.) The resolutions, subject to the omission of^t, paragraph (c),sub-paragraph ii, and to such amendments as might bedetermined on by the Secretary of State for the colonies and the President of the Board of Trade, should be presented to the Imperial War Conference at its sittingon Wednesday, the 4th April, if, in the meantime, no member of the War Cabinet raised any point in themfor discussion.Hospital Ships. 6. The First Sea Lord reported that another hospital ship, the&quot; Gloucester Castle,&quot; had been damaged and beached, and that itwas not known whether the injury was caused by mine orsubmarine.The further consideration of this matter, in reference to thequestion of reprisals, was adjourned for the meeting of the imperial war Cabinet on Tuesday, the 3rd April, when the Report of lord curzon&apos;s Committee upon the policy of reprisals would be available.Submarines.7. The First Sea Lord reported an action between a &quot; Q&quot; trawlerand an enemy submarine with results that seemed promising, aswell as three&apos;actions between &quot; Q, &quot; ships and enemy submarines,Arabia. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that a turkish Division was still at or iu the neighbourhood of Medina,and that, owing to the operations of the Arabs against the railways^it appeared doubtful whether it would be able to get away.
86which had involved some loss of life and damage to two british ships. Two of the British vessels, &quot; Q-7 &quot; and &quot; Q-36,&quot; had heenbrought in. He pointed out that the experience of some of ourown submarines which had been shelled pointed to the fact that unless these vessels were hit at very short range they had a very good chance of escaping being sunk. He also reported seriousmarine casualties inflicted by submarines and raiders.Russia: 8. The First Sea Lord read three telegrams from   russia the Baltic Fleet. indicating a continuance of the serious situation in regard to the discipline of the Russian Baltic Fleet and reporting the removal,for political reasons, of some of the most efficient Russian officers from ports in the White Sea.Shipping Losses. 9- The War Cabinet had some discussion on the question ofshipping losses, which were reaching most serious proportions.The First Sea Lord stated that he was in communication withthe Shipping Controller on the subject of the desirability of buildingmore and smaller merchant ships in those cases in which newvessels had not yet been actually laid down, in order &quot;to compel theenemy to expend as many torpedoes as possible in his submarine campaign. He further expressed some misgivings as to whetherthe crews obtained from the mercantile marine would continue to face the risks, which were increasing every day, owing to thegreater distances at which the submarines were able to operate.The view of the War Cabinet was that if such a situationarose (of which there was at the moment no indication), some formof compulsion for marine service might he necessary.The Barrow Strike. 10- The Minister of Labour reported that, all negotiations forthe settlement of the Barrow strike having failed, he had decided,as the result of a Conference held on the same morning, that thetime had come to take action for the arrest, under Regulation 42 ofthe Defence of the Realm Act, of the ringleaders concerned. he therefore proposed to issue at once a Proclamation. If this did not bring about a cessation of the strike within twenty-four hours, allthe members of the Shop Committee responsible for organising thestrike (numbering some twenty to thirty men) should be arrested and tried. The Law Officers of the Crown supported the decision that action should be taken under Regulation 42 of the Defence ofthe Realm Act.While recognising the risk of an extension of the movement,the War Cabinet saw no alternative to the action proposed, and decided that A Proclamation, calling ou the Barrow workmen to return towork within twenty-four hours, should be issued that afternoon (2nd April).If the men did not return, the Shop Stewards who brought themen out on strike should be arrested under Regulation 42of the Defence of the Realm Act for the impeding of theproduction of war material.When the men had returned, negotiations should at once be opened for settling their grievance as to piece-rates.It was noted that the Minister of Labour had offeredsettlement with retrospective payment, and that the amalgamated society of Engineers and the Employers&apos; Federation had also tried to bring about a settlement.(Initialled) D.

APPENDIX I.My dear Arthur, April 1, 1917.I AM rather disturbed about Sweden, though Howard takes it calmly after hismanner. The new Government seems to me almost as bad as it can be. ThePrime Minister is a pro-German banker a rival of the Wallenbergs who was oneof the promoters of the loan to Germany about a year ago. Lindman, the EoreignMinister, was one of the Swedish delegates in the Anglo-Swedish negotiations of 1915,and was then thought to be strongly anti-British. He inspires one of the rnostviolent Activist papers in Stockholm. Akerman, the Minister of War, is said to be adecided Activist. All this, taken in connection with the recent reports by Andersenand the King of Denmark of the pro-German utterances of the King of Sweden, andthe presence of the Queen in Berlin, seems to me to make an attempt at a coup d&apos;Etatnot wholly impossible. The King was said to believe that the U-boat campaign was bound to succeed, and no Swedish shipping has moved between here and Sweden forthe last two months. The alarmist speeches here have no doubt increased this impression. Against all this is the fact that we have kept the Swedes very short for months, and they are said to be now in want of cereals. Some people say, however,that they could just get on without imports.I do not know if the War Cabinet should be informed of all this, in case they canthink of any military or naval precautions which should be taken. Military action might take the form of pressure on Norway to send sulphur, copper, fish to Germany.Yours ever,ROBERT CECIL.APPENDIX II.Draft Resolutions on the subject of Import and Export proposed by the President ofthe Board of Trade.(Arising out of the Board of Trade Memorandum on the Control of Certain Articlesafter the War.)(A.) Wool.IT is desirable that there should be immediate consultation among such of theDominion Governments as are. concerned with wool production for the purpose of framing a scheme for the control, so far as possible, of wool produced in the BritishEmpire during the period immediately following the war, with a view to safeguardingImperial resources and meeting the industrial needs of the Empire and the Allies.(B.) Metals.1. That it is desirable that the exports to foreign countries of important ores andmetals (the produce of the British Empire) should be controlled for a period afterthe war.2. That the Conference welcomes the proposed establishment of a powerfulorganisation among the Allies for dealing with non-ferrous metals and ores, soas to free the Empire and the Allied countries from their previous dependence on german-controlled organisations for this purpose. That the proposed inter-Allyorganisation should preferably be based on national organisations, with machinery for joint action, and that the Non-Eerrous Metals Committee set up by the Board ofTrade, and now enlarged by the addition of Dominion representatives, be chargedwith working out a detailed scheme for discussion with the French and other Allies.3. That the Governments of the Empire should consider the desirability of imposing restrictions on the acquisition of mineral rights, or of certain classes of mineral rights, within the Empire by or on behalf of aliens, and particularly of subjects of present enemy States.
(C.) Meat.In view of the extent to which the United Kingdom and certain other parts of theEmpire are dependent on oversea supplies for meat and of the desirahility of freeingBritish markets from excessive dependence on foreign organisations which controlimportant sources of supply, this Conference is of opinion that there should become-operation between the Imperial Government and the Governments of the Overseas( ) Dominions to ensure (1.) That the Empire shordd become as far as possible self-sufficing in the matterof meat supplies.(2.) That the co-operation of Imperial credit -should be secured to the OverseasDominions in developing their meat resources by means of railways,irrigation works, &amp;c.(3.) That the United Kingdom and other portions of the Empire which do not produce enough meet for their own needs should have a first call at reasonable prices on meat produced in other parts of the Empire in excessof local requirements.(4.) That in so far as there is a surplus of meat supplies the Imperial Governmentshould assist the Governments of the Overseas Dominions in securing ashare of continental and American trade. 1(5.) That the Imperial Government should influence British instdated tonnage sothat it may be directed towards the aforesaid purposes.In order that the aims set forth herein may be attained, the Governments of the overseas Dominions should take steps to ensure that they should have full control over their meat resources, and should prepare detailed plans for discussion with theImperial Government for the development and distribution of their meet supply.o
