The First Sea Lord reported that he had received a communi-cation from the Russian Naval Staff at Petrograd through the RussianNaval Attache in London to the effect that discipline was beingrestored in the Baltic Fleet, and efficiency would be attained. TheRussians pointed out that they considered a German attack on the island of Oselby German Naval and Military Forces highly probableas soon as practicable after the ice broke up, and asked for british naval assistance.The War Cabinet, after discussing the question with the first sea Lord, decided that The Admiralty should render such assistance as they deemedpracticable, the nature of which was indicated by AdmiralJellicoe.The United Statesof America:The SubmarineMenace.9. The First Sea Lord reported a conversation with Admiral: Sims, the United States Naval Representative, who had stated thatthe impression in his country, as well as his own impression, whenhe left, was that we had the submarine-menace in hand.   So longas this view prevailed, Admiral Sims considered that the United
States of America would not do much, to? help us in anti-submarine warfare. Admiral Sims had been Convinced, in the &quot;course of the conversation, that the position was very serious, and proposed, after further consultation with Sir John Jellicoe, to send a telegram tothat effect to his Government, which he thought would result inevery effort being made by the Americans to assist us in every possible way to combat the submarine menace, more especially asthe Government of the United States of America held very strongviews relative to the &quot; Freedom of the Seas.&quot;The War Cabinet authorised Admiral Sir John Jellicoe to communicate freely and franklywith Admiral Sims in regard to the submarine menace.Hospital Ships: 10- &apos;^ae First- Sea Lord reported that he had made enquiriesEeprisals. as to whether, in the event of the War Cabinet desiring it, theFrench would be willing to continue to carry out the bombing of open towns as an act of reprisal for attack on hospital ships, providedthat the Royal Naval Air Service Unit now in the South of France leftall its materiel there. He stated that the Royal Naval Air service personnel were required for seaplane duties.Lord Milner reported that the question had arisen duringEaster, and, as the result of a consultation between the PrimeMinister and himself, it had been decided to commence at once the bombing of an open town in Germany, and that the French had agreed to co-operate in this case and had approved the objective.The First Sea Lord stated that leaflets would be dropped whenthe bombing took place, to indicate that this raid was carried out asa reprisal for the sinking of the hospital ship &quot; Asturias.&quot;The War Cabinet endorsed this decision, and requested theFirst Sea Lord to inform them as to the result of theenqruries referred to above.The War Cabinet further decided that The Prime Minister should be asked to inform the dominion ministers to-morrow as to the action that had generallybeen taken in this matter.The western front:Eeception ofWounded.Restrictions as to women andChildren leaving the Country.The Transport andEmployment in theUnited Kingdomof Desertersfrom the german armies.11.

The War Cabinet had under consideration an extract froma report by the Prisoners of War Sub-Committee, dated 16th March,191.7, on the subject of a proposal for the transport from denmark and the employment in the United Kingdom of deserters of Danishrace from the German armies. After discussion it was decided that By introducing these men we should be incurring risks and anamount of trouble out of all proportion to the results to be[1365-117] &apos; B 2
anticipated, which are very problematical. Moreover,shipping, food, and possibly labour difficulties alone made such a course very undesirable. In these circumstances no action should be taken in the matter.Proposals for improving theOutput of materials to Russia.14. The War Cabinet decided that Lord Milner&apos;s Committee, the duties of which were laid down on the 4th April, 1917 (War Cabinet 113, Minute 16),should decide on Brigadier-General Poole&apos;s proposal forthe establishment of a joint British and Russian Committeein Petrograd to deal, on behalf of Russia, with orders for materials from the British Isles (G.T.-380 a).Fitting AdditionalBulkheads to NewMerchant Ships.15.

They did not believe that they would save the ship ; onthe other hand, they interfered seriously with the working of the cargo.a contrary opinion as regards the that, in any case, she would takeafford more  opportunity for  theThe First Seasaving of the ship,Lord held and statedlonger  to sink, which wouldbeaching of the vessel or the saving of life.The War Cabinet decided that In the first instance, representatives of the Constructive Depart-ment of the Admiralty and the Shipbuilders&apos; Committeeshould confer, and the matter should only be again brought forward for the consideration of the War Cabinet if theyfailed to agree.Mammoth WheatShips.16.

The   War   Cabinet had  under  consideration  a  letter(Appendix) from the Shipping Controller to the Secretary, givingthe particulars in regard to the mercantile losses for the first ninedays of April and March respectively, but the First Sea Lord pointedout that, though the losses were extremely serious, the comparisonhad been made between periods of relatively heavy and lightlosses
