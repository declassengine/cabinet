It was decided, however, that separate Com-mittees should be set up for England and Wales, Scotland andL-eland, it being understood that the Chairman of the three Com-mittees would confer together from time to time. The object of[1365-153] B
this arrangement was to ensure ample latitude being allowed for the varying conditions in the several countries, while securing co-ordination on general principles.Subject to practicable Reports being received from the Com-mittees, the policy of the Government in regard to the liquorquestion should be based on the threefold ground of Control,Purchase, and Local Option.Lord Milner undertook, in consultation with the Home Secretary,the Chief Secretary for Ireland, and the Secretary forScotland, to submit names of suitable members for theproposed Committees.The following preliminary draft of the Terms of Reference wasagreed to : The Government, having decided to assume the control of the liquor traffic during the War and the period of demobilisa-tion, and being of opinion that such control would ultimately lead to State purchase after the War of theinterests concerned, appoint Committees to examine andreport on the suitable financial arrangements for taking over these interests.Proposed Amnesty 3.

APPENDIX I.G.T.-885. ---Liquor Restrictions and Control.Report by Lord Milner.   (See War Cabinet 138 (5)).AT the request of the Prime Minister, I have had two interviews with a number of representative brewers introduced by Sir George Younger. These meetings were heldat 2, Whitehall Gardens, on Thursday, the 17th May, and Friday, the 25th May. those present were: Mr. S. 0. Neville.Colonel Addison.Mr. Sykes.Mr. Percy Reid.Colonel Gretton.Colonel Gaskell.Mr. Watson Lovibond.Sir George Younger.Colonel Hall Walker.Sir Edward Holt.Mr. Watson Lovibond was present only at the second meeting.There was a very full and frank discussion. Some of those present were at firstevidently under the impression that the control which the Government proposed toexercise was rather a limited affair, and that they would be able to resume theirbusinesses at the end of it practically unaltered with a solatium for temporarydisturbance. But when the extent of the difficiilty with which we are confronted, came to be realised, and they understood that, in order to make the available stock of maltgo round, a general dilution of beer would have to be resorted to, that a number ofpublic-houses and even breweries would have to be closed, &amp;c, I think they aHrecognised that the interference with their business, the practical wreckage of good-will, pointed to such a big figure of compensation, that it could never be entertainedwithout the State getting some quid pro quo, and that purchase was therefore the onlyultimate possible solution. They did not pretend to like it, but they adopted a veryreasonable attitude, fully understanding that the Government was not taking up thequestion otherwise than from sheer necessity, and owing to the difficulties with whichit is confronted in consequence of the war. Reluctantly admitting that State control was forced upon us, and that it involved steps which would injure their businesses, ormany of them, beyond hope of repair, thej7 expressed themselves quite willing to givethe Government every assistance in their power in making the new system work whichcould only be done with the help of people conversant with the trade provided, ofcourse, that they were assured of getting a fair price for the business which the state was going to take away from them.The basis on which such a price could be fixed was the subject of a good deal ofdiscussion, and several useful suggestions were made. What it all came to, however,was that there must be a strong commission or committee appointed to lay down theprinciples on which the brewers&apos; interests could be ultimately taken over, before whichcommittee, sitting in private, the representatives of the trade should have anopportunity of stating their views. It was strongly urged that this committee shouldbe appointed without delay, as the trade could not be expected to acquiesce in the taking over of control by the Government without knowing what it had to expect in theway of ultimate payment. I want to make it quite clear that nobody suggested thatthe brewers should be bought out at once, though it was pointed out that some immediate payment would have to be made to dispossessed retailers. What wasinsisted on was that the terms on which purchase was ultimately to he effected shouldbe settled before steps were taken to disturb the trade. This was assuming that theGovernment would be very unlikely to take the alternative course of agreeing, in lieu of purchase, to pay compensation for disturbance, having regard to the enormousfigures to which such compensation might run. The brewers no doubt would prefer the latter course, but none of them expect that it will be adopted.The immediate question before the Cabinet is whether it should appoint the contemplated finance committee. It seems to me that this is an absolute necessityand that no time should be lost. We shall be pressed, when Parliament meets, tostate our policy, and once we announce it we shall be bombarded with inquiries by the
trade and the enemies of the trade as to how we propose to deal with the interests involved ; and we ought to he in a position to reply that the basis of the necessary financial provisions is being examined by a strong disinterested authority. no progress can be made until the brewers know what fate awaits them ; but if conditionsof ultimate purchase were laid down which they regarded as reasonable, I believe anyserious opposition on their part and on that of the Unionist party would disappear.On the other hand, a great number of the Liberal party would, I believe, be attracted by the prospect of the immediate closing of a great number of public-houses and thegeneral introduction of lighter beers, coupled with the promise of local option afterthe war.   The Nationalists are in favour of purchase any way.Under these circumstances, I am inclined to think that the opposition which our proposals would have to encounter, except from the extreme temperance men and perhaps a majority of the Scottish Liberals, has been rather over-estimated, and that ashort Bill, like that already before the Cabinet, with a schedule laying down the bases of ultimate purchase as determined by the proposed financial committee, would not beso difficult to pass as we have been led to think. But whether we ultimately determineto introduce a Bill or not, we can make no progress at all until these bases are determined, and for this reason I would again urge that the appointment of a committee which, if set up at once, might get through its business in a few weeks is of thegreatest importance.There is only one other point on which I should be glad of a decision. TheLicensed Victuallers are all in a great state of agitation, and are clamouring to see meor some representative of the Government. I think it would be a good thing to seethem, to let them know what is proposed, and to give them the assurance, already given to the brewers, that if the contemplated committee is set up they will have every opportunity of representing their case before it. But I think it would be better not to see them until I am, or any other member of the Government who may be deputedto do so is, in a position to say at least as much as that.(Initialled) M.May 30, 1917.&apos;
WC 153APPENDIX II.Terms of Reference for Lord Northcliffe on his Appointment as Head of british war Mission in the United States of America.(See War Cabinet 152, Minute 1.)1. SEVERAL Government Departments the Treasury, Admiralty, War Office,Ministry of Munitions, Ministry $f Shipping, and Ministry of Food have Missionsrepresenting their interests in the United States of America: These Missions areacting, more or less, independently, with the result that there is conflict of interests,and loss of effort.2. The War Cabinet have decided that a man of high business qualifications, wideknowledge, experience, and energy, shall be appointed with direct responsibility tothem as Head of a British War Mission, comprising the existing Departmental Missions,so that by generally supervising and co-ordinating their action he may prevent over-lapping and secure better results. He will have full authority over all the DepartmentalMissions, and will have the right to dispense with the services of any member whom he may consider unsuitable.3. His primary duty wiU be to control our own operations, e.g., the recruiting ofBritish citizens, and the manufacture, purchase, and transport over land and sea of all supplies. He will determine the priority of conflicting claims among different departments in these and kindred matters.4. As Great Britain is not the only purchaser of supplies in the United States ofAmerica, it will be necessary for the Head of the Mission to establish and maintain thefriendliest possible relations, not only with the United States authorities, but also withthe representatives of our Allies in the United States of America, to promoteco-operation between them, and to use his utmost endeavours to avoid competition between them, and the raising of prices.5. On questions of importance arising directly out of his Mission the Head of theMission will have the right to communicate direct with the Prime Minister ; on mattersof less importance, or of departmental detail, he will communicate to the Head of theDepartment concerned, either direct or through the Departments representative in theUnited States of America.6. The Head of the British War Mission will keep the British Ambassador atWashington generally informed of the main lines of his action, and will profit by theAmbassadoFs advice and assistance, whenever these may be required.7. The Head of the British War Mission will have full authority to establishcentral offices ; to engage such staff as his experience may show to be necessary; andto concentrate or group in one or more buildings such of the Departmental Missions as,after investigation, he considers desirable.8. The expenses of the Head of the British War Mission will be borne on theTreasury Vote. Arrangements will be made forthwith and communicated to the Headof the Mission by the Treasury for placing the necessary credits at his disposal.present state ofBritishMission inU.S.A.Head of mission.Duties ofHead of mission.Allied Co-operation.Communi-cating with,the HomeGovern-ment.Eelationswith, theBritishAmbassa-dor.Establish-nient of offices.FinancialAr range-men ts.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 31, 1917.
