THE Director of Military Operations reported that theGermans had withdrawn approximately to the Hindenburg Une,with which the advanced troops of both British and French armieswere at certain places in touch. In the region of Arras our troops had actually penetrated that line near its point of junction with theold German line, while the French had penetrated what was believed to be the Hindenburg line at a point south of St. Quentin ; but the exact location of that line south of that town was uncertain.The enemy had been burning St. Quentin, and, though thesituation was still obscure, there were indications that they, might take up a position in some localities in rear of the Hindenburg line.2. The Director of Military Operations informed the WarCabinet of the occupation by the British of Fallujah, on theEuphrates, and explained that the occupation of this point, togetherwith that of Nasiriyah, gave us control of a good supply area, andshould have a favourable effect on the neighbouring Arab tribes.On the Tigris the situation remained unchanged, and theremnant of the Turkish force was entrenching to the south ofSamara.On the Diala River, General Maude&apos;s force had reached a pointone march beyond Bakuba and 70 miles from Khanikin, from whichplace the Russians were 80 miles distant in the other direction.Though both forces were approximately equidistant from this place100] B
the Russians were farther off as regards time, because they wereseparated from it by a difficult and snowbound pass.General Maude had reported that his situation as regardsupplies was entirely satisfactory ; large quantities were obtainableat Bakuba, and more particularly at Baghdad itself, where theresources had been found to be much greater than had been ; *anticipated, the stores discovered including frozen meat, ice-machines, soda-water factories, and live-stock.Medina.Eoumania:Information as toEailway Service.3. The Director of Military Operations stated that the reportsof the Turkish withdrawal from Medina along the Hedjaz Railwaywere gradually being confirmed, and that the Arabs were growingcorrespondingly more active.4. The Director of Military Operations stated that he hadreceived information from the British military attache in Roumaniato the effect that the Roumanian railway communications had recently greatly improved, and that he hoped they would be normalin ten days&apos; time.Submarines.Mining of theHospital Ship&quot; Asturias.&quot;The shipping situation.Possible Develop-ment of scottish and Irish Ports forthe Purpose of receiving imported supplies.5. The First Sea Lord made his usual report regarding therecent mercantile losses from submarines. He also gave a detailedaccount of the sinking by torpedo, to the north of the Shetlands, ofa German submarine by His Majesty&apos;s submarine G.-13, on the10th March.6. The First Sea Lord reported that the hospital ship&quot; Asturias&quot; had been mined off the Start, and had subsequently been beached. The loss of life was small, no wounded being onboard.7. The^ War Cabinet had a short discussion on the seriousshipping situation. The discussion arose from a consideration of telegram No. 753 of the 20th March, 1917, from the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to the British Minister at The Hague,indicating the probable early necessity of requisitioning the Dutchshipping at present in our ports.8. In connection with the preceding Minute, the War cabinet considered the possibility of developing additional ports in Scotlandand Ireland with the object of providing alternative points to which supplies might be brought and landed without the necessity of thevessels carrying them passing through the narrow approaches to theChannel and North Sea.The War Cabinet decided that /   A Committee should be appointed, composed as follows :  A ChairmanA Representative of the Admiralty,,,     Shipping Controller,,, ,,     Railway Executive Committee,,,     Port and Transit Committee,- A dock expert [to be appointed by the Port of london authority^With Fleet-Paymaster P. H. Row and Captain ClementJones as Joint Secretaries^To examine and report upon the possibility of developingalternative ports  in Scotland and  Ireland  into which supplies could be brought.
Possible Secession 9. With, a view to possible investigation at a later date by of Allies. Committee of the War Cabinet, the War Cabinet invited lord curzon to confer with the various Departments concerned and toprepare a report on the probable effect on our own prospects in theWar of the secession of one or more of our Allies.ftaly. 10. The War Cabinet instructed  the  Director of  MilitaryOperations to telegraph to the Chief of the Imperial General Staffin the sense that the Italian Ambassador had communicated to thePrime Minister a message from the Italian Prime Minister requesting that Sir William Robertson might be instructed to use every endeavour to arrange to provide assistance to the Italian Army. should the necessity for it arise.Egyptian Expedi-tionary Force.French Co-opera-tion.11. In reference to the definite decision of the French to attachtwo battalions of Algerian Tirailleurs and one troop of Spahis tothe Egyptian Expeditionary Force, operating towards Palestine, theDirector of Military Operations raised the question as to the status of this contingent.   The War Cabinet decided that This small force ought to be definitely under the orders of theBritish Commander-in-Chief, and that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should communicate with theFrench Government to this effect-Italian Co-opera- 12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that the. Italian Government also desired to attach a nominal force to theBritish troops in order to show the Italian flag in the area to betraversed. In all probability this force would be of the minimumstrength possible and would possess no military value.Having regard to the fact that, in virtue of the 9th Article ofthe Treaty of the 26th April, 1915, by which the Italians undertook to enter the war, they already possessed the right to a voice in thedisposal of such Turkish Possessions (including Palestine) as mightfall into the hands of the Allies, the War Cabinet, while recognising the strength of the political objections to the admission of yet another Ally to participation in this Expedition, felt that it wouldbe difficult and impolitic, by a blunt refusal to their request, further to aggravate our diplomatic relations with the Italians, who were already somewhat put out by the negotiations in regard to asia minor.   The War Cabinet therefore decided that The proposal should be accepted on the distinct understandingthat there was .to be no political mission attached to theforce, and that Italian interests should not be looked upon as being concerned beyond the &quot; brown area &quot; shown onthe coloured map attached to the Anglo-Franco-RussianExchange of Notes respecting Asia Minor of April 1916(the Sykes-Picot Agreement).13. The Director of Military Operations stated that thePortuguese Government had expressed disappointment at the slowrate at which their troops were being transported to France, and, to remedy the situation, had put forward two alternative proposals : (1.) That the British Government should assume the respon-sibility for the supply of all transport animals; or(2.) That the Portuguese  troops  should be conveyed from&apos; i  &apos; i       - . Lisbon to Bordeaux instead of from Lisbon to Brest, inorder to shorten the passage.[1365-100] B 2
The Director of Military Operations explained that as regards(1) we were ourselves badly off for horses, and that, since the animalswe supplied to the Portuguese would have to be replaced from america, there would be no gain in time.The First Sea Lord explained that Bordeaux was a difficult port,which was often mined, and that, as the distance from Lisbon toBordeaux was practically the same as from Lisbon to Brest, therewould be no saving of time in adopting the second alternative. he also explained that, without jeopardising other transport, including that of pur food supplies, it would be impossible to furnish moredestroyers for convoying Portuguese transports, and therefore impos-sible to. do anything to expedite the conveyance of the troops.Having regard to the above statements, the War Cabinet decidedthat Neither of the alternatives suggested by the Portuguese couldbe acceded to, and that the Portuguese Government shouldbe so informed by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.Restrictions as to women andChildren leaving the Country.14. The First Sea Lord explained that, under the existing restrictions for leaving the British Isles, it was being found impds-sible to obtain licences to embark for a certain number of women and children who wished to leave and not to come back, and for whose presence in the country there was no necessity. The WarCabinet decided that The Secretary should ascertain the present regulations on thissubject.Russia.The Revolution.Telegram from thePrime Minister tothe President ofthe Council.15. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that theRussian Charge d&apos;Affaires had called upon him and pressed for thedespatch of a telegram from the Prime Minister to the RussianPresident of the Council.. i After discussion of a preliminary draft, prepared by theauthority of the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet left the precise terms of the telegram for the Prime Ministers further consideration.Proposed Resolu-tion to the Duma, &apos;16. In reference to War Cabinet, 99, Minute 10, the WarCabinet, after consideration of the comments of the british ambassador in Petrograd on the draft resolution prepared by thePrime Minister (Foreign Office telegram No. 514, dated the19th March, 1917, to the British Ambassador at Petrograd) andthe reply (telegram No. 514, dated the 20th March, 1917, from theBritish Ambassador at Petrograd to the Foreign Office), decided ona resolution to be passed by the House of Commons in the followingform : :&quot; That this House sends the Duma its fraternal greetings,and, tenders to the Russian people its heartfelt congratulationson the establishment, among them of free institutions, in full confidence that they will lead not only to the rapid and happyprogress of the Russian nation, but to the prosecution, in close alliance with the constitutional Governments of western europe, and with renewed steadfastness and vigour, of the war against the stronghold of autocratic militarism which threatensthe liberty of Europe.&quot;The Czar.-    17. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a telegram  Q)from the British Ambassador in Petrograd raising the question ofthe relations&apos; of the British Ambassador and the Head of the british military&quot; Mission with the members of the Russian Imperial Family
(telegram No. 359, dated the 20th March, 1917, from the british ambassador, Petrograd, to the Foreign Office). The War cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send a replyto the British Ambassador, Petrograd, based on thefollowing principles : (1.) That the Ambassador already had authority torecognise the Provisional Government; but thathe must obtain guarantees that that Governmentwould carry out the engagements of its predecessor.(2.) That General Hanbury-Williams should not go toTsarskoe Selo without definite instructions.That in his relations with friends who were members of the Grand Ducal Families, theBritish Ambassador should take great care toavoid giving cause for umbrage, as it was ofgreat importance that he should be able to retainhis authority with all parties, and particularly with the Provisional Government, with which theBritish Government desire to cultivate good relations.(3.) That no invitation had as yet been sent to theEmperor to come to Great Britain ; that in hisown interest the British Government would beglad if he could leave Russia ; but that they werein doubt as to whether Great Britain was theright place for him to go to.(Initialled) D.
