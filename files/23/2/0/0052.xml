May 1917.
Russia.3. With reference to War Cabinet 123, Minute 10, the WarCabinet further discussed the question of the extent to which it isjustifiable, in existing circumstances, to continue the shipment ofmunitions and other war material to Russia, having special regardto the disquieting situation in that country, the delay in completionof our own programme of heavy guns, and the position as regardsshipping.The War Cabinet were informed that ships were sailing toRussia half empty, that this fact was bound to create a badimpression, and that considerable pressure was being applied by theRussian Government and their representatives in this country tosend more material.The War Cabinet decided that So far as their present information went, there was no sufficient justification for a reversal of their previous decision to postpone as far as possible the provision of tonnagerequired to carry out the Russian programme withoutcalling attention to the delay; but they agreed that ships,if proceeding to Russia, should carry full cargoes.Possible Defection.4. In view of the fact that news from Russia continued to beof an unsatisfactory nature, the War Cabinet invited Lord curzon to complete and present his Report, so far as Russia was concerned,which he had been asked to prepare at the Meeting held on the21st March, 1917 (War Cabinet 100, Minute 9).Mesopotamia. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that GeneralMaude&apos;s recent operations against the Arab Tribes which had been giving trouble to the west of Baghdad had achieved successful results.   General Maude was now engaged in consolidating theoccupation of the Baghdad Vilayet.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary of State for War to convey their congratulations to General Maude on the practical completion of the taskhe had been instructed by them to carry out.Palestine:The higher command.6. In continuation of the discussion held at the Meeting on the5th April (War Cabinet 126, Minute 15), the War Cabinet con-sidered the question of the Higher Command of the PalestineExpedition. -It was understood that General Smuts was unwilling to accept the Command unless he was sure that he would have sufficient forces at his disposal to carry the Expedition to a successful conclusion. Some doubt was expressed, in the course of the dis-cussion, as to whether the conquest of Palestine still remained afeasible operation with the troops likely to be available, in view ofthe new situation created by the failure of the Russians to exertpressure on the Turks in the Caucasus.The War Cabinet instructed The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to discuss the whole situation in regard to the operations in Palestine withGeneral Smuts, and to ascertain definitely from himwhether he was prepared to take over the Command ofthe Expedition.Salonica. 7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that, on a review of the situation in France and in Palestine respectively, hehad come to the conclusion that the best use to be made of the
infantry of the British division to be withdrawn from Salonica wouldbe to transfer it to Franoe. The artillery of the division could with advantage be transported to Egypt to complete a new division inthat country, for which the infantry had already been supplied from india.The question was postponed for further consideration.Provision of WarMaterial and aircraft.Protection ofVulnerable Points.8. The Secretary of State for War undertook to report on thefollowing defects which had been brought to the notice of thePrime Minister during his visit the previous day to the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the British Expeditionary Force :  a.) The provision of caps on projectiles.b.) The provision of new howitzers,(c.) The supply of heavy guns.(d.) The provision of single-seater fighters.In this latter connection the Prime Minister reported thatGeneral Trenchard had stated to him that he was very short of fastsingle-seater scouts, and that he had urged that the Air board should concentrate on stimulating and expediting the supply ofthese aircraft, although General Trenchard did not believe that wecould hope to obtain a superiority over the enemy in this respectbefore 1918.9. Having regard to the reduction from 75,000 to 23,000 (ofwhom only 4,200 were hostile males of military age) in the numberof enemy aliens of all ages and sexes at large in this country ; to thearrangements for watching the few that remained at large ; to theorganisation for controlling the entry of aliens through the ports ;to the fact that no acts of sabotage had been committed in theUnited Kingdom during the war, and to the urgent need of releasing all possible man-power from non-essential purposes, theWar Cabinet decided, on the advice of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff- To accept the risk of reducing the troops to guard vulnerable points to the minimum necessary for the protection of afew places of vital national importance, such as importantdocks, magazines, filling factories, cable landing-places, andquays where aliens might land.The application of this decision in detail was left to the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff, in consultation with theAdmiralty, the Ministry of Munitions, the Field-marshal commanding-in-Chief the Home Forces, and departments concerned.anyotherSubmarines.10. The First Sea Lord made his usual report of merchantshipping losses. He also reported that bombing raids had beencarried out against hostile objectives with satisfactory results, inparticular at Dedeli and Bruges.He further described in detail several engagements betweenenemy submarines and our own destroyers, submarines, and hydro-planes, as the result of which there was sufficient evidence to justifythe belief that several hostile vessels had been sunk./Liquor Restriction 11. The  War Cabinet resumed - the consideration of Liquorand Control. Restriction and Control (War Cabinet 133, Minute 5).The subject was considered more, especially in the light of thediminishing supply of beer under the present brewing arrangements and
of the probable attitude of Parliament to State Purchase. It was clear-that unless some measure of central control was exercised immediately,the available stocks of malt and barley would be exhausted earlier.)&quot;^than was necessary, because of the demand for heavy beer and stout.&apos;A complete stoppage of the supply of beer would be certain to leads to strong protests, particularly on the part of some classes of munition workers. In the meantime, as the stocks were beingexhausted and as Prohibition was undoubtedly approaching, thetrade was being ruined. Such a policy of drift would satisfy no onebut those who advocated Prohibition without compensation.The Parliamentary position was also one of great difficulty. a memorial had been signed, at the instigation of Mr. J. M. Henderson,M.P., by a large number of Members of the House of Commons,including supporters of the present Government, protesting againstState Purchase. The Secretary for Scotland had ascertained thatout of sixty-three Liberal Members for Scotland, thirty were againstState Purchase, and these also included supporters of the present administration. Further, with the constant pressure and anxiety ofthe conduct of the war upon the War Cabinet, and with the Irishand Electoral Reform problems unsettled, it was not possible for the-Cabinet to give to a measure which threatened to be highly controversial the thought and attention it would inevitablydemand. Such a measure, once introduced, might even lead to a dissolution.The Cabinet examined the possibility of dealing separately withIreland and Scotland. The Chief Secretary for Ireland thought itwould be possible to deal with Ireland alone. The brewers therewere few, and only some half-dozen distilleries were of anymagnitude. Of the 17,000 licences perhaps a third could be closedat once at a cost of, say, 1,500,0001. Another third could bereduced gradually by one-half. In this way the trade could bereduced to about one-half of its present dimensions. compensation to the closed houses could not be levied on those remaining open, atany rate during the War.The Secretary for Scotland said that the idea of the &quot;Stateturned publican &quot; was extremely repugnant to the people of Scotland.What would most commend itself to public opinion there would be total prohibition of spirits during the War. In reply to the PrimeMinister Mr. Munro agreed that, if the operation of the TemperanceAct were advanced from 1920 to, say, October, 1917, it would makea difference, but less than might be imagined, because of the difficultyof satisfactorily working the Act in the absence of so many men atthe Front.The War Cabinet next considered whether the situation couldnot be met in two stages. In the first place, the. State might takeover immediate control of the Liquor Trade as an urgent Warmeasure. In the second place, it might, at the same time, appoint a strong Commission to consider what further steps would benecessary to carry out such control, what compensation would need to be paid for actual losses incurred in consequence, whether itwould not be preferable for the State to buy out the trade, and, if so, on what terms and under what conditions.The first step could be taken as an administrative act underthe Defence of the Realm A.cts. It was agreed, however, that compensation could not be dealt with on the lines followed by theDefence of the Realm Losses Commission, nor would it be satisfactory to grant temporary compensation, for it would probably have to beon so costly a scale that it migh b differ little from the amount required to buy out the trade altogether. It would be desirable,should a Commission be set up, to instruct it to be prepared to treat athe trade fairly. It should enquire whether a system of State &quot;Purchase of the Liquor Traffic can fairly and properly be set up at-the end of the war, and, if so, on what basis it can be framed, inEngland and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland respectively.
Four courses thus seemed open to the War Cabinet: (1.) To do nothing which, in the situation whieh had arisen,was impossible.(2.) To adopt Prohibition. This, it was agreed, would be strongly opposed by many soldiers and munition workers,and was therefore impossible.(3.) To adopt State Purchase. This the War Cabinet believed to be the right principle, but it would require to beexpounded and defended in Parliament; it would incurhostility in many sections of the House, consume thetime of the Cabinet, and possibly lead to a GeneralElection.(4.) To institute State Control at once under the Defence of the realm Acts; close a large number of selectedpublic-houses and breweries; and investigate, by meansof a Commission, the question of compensation and purchase.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To adjourn the discussion at this stage, in order to enablethe Prime Minister to consult some of his Liberal andLabour colleagues and to see some representativebrewers.(6.) To ask Lord Milner to prepare a Memorandum on thenature and extent of the State Control proposed.Purchase of Spirits 12. The Minister of Munitions stated that there was a shortagefrom Bond. of 100,000 gallons a week of spirits needed for industrial purposes.These supplies had  hitherto  been  imported,  but the ShippingController was now raising difficulties owing to scarcity of tonnage.The War Cabinet authorised The Minister of Munitions to requisition the necessary spiritsfrom bond, paying the owners&apos; cost of production plus areasonable profit, but not the present highly-inflatedprices.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 8, 1917.o
