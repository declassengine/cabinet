The Trade CardSystem and theSchedule of Pro-tected Occupations.1. THE War Cabinet considered the position which had arisenout&quot; &quot;of their decision to supersede the Trade Card Scheme by aoccupations  andlimits   (War  Cabinet  10;schedtde   of minute 2).The Secretary of State for War explained that, in accordancewith this decision and acting on schedides prepared by the Govern-ment Departments mainly concerned, orders had been issued by theWar Office calling up men under the new system. Yesterday,however, in a Conference with delegates from the amalgamated society of Engineers, an undertaking had been given on behalf ofthe Government that the members of the Amalgamated Society of engineers would not be called up until further negotiations hadtaken place. This undertaking could not be carried out because themen had in fact already been called up, some of them being due toreport on Monday next. Pledges had also been given previously toother Trade Unions that they would not receive less favourable treatment than the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. A position had thus arisen which threatened seriously to diminish the numberof recruits immediately forthcoming.Mr. Henderson stated that the tone of the Conference had beenvery menacing. The delegates had demanded that the Trade CardScheme should be continued, and threats of an immediate stoppagethroughout the country had been used. There was undoubtedlygrave unrest in the country, which had been deepened by theRussian Revolution, and as Labour Day (the 1st May) was approaching, the situation was one which would need careful handling. It had been made plain to the delegates that theGovernment would only negotiate on the basis of the schedules, andwould not countenance any return to the Trade Card Scheme. Atelegram had been received from the Amalgamated Society of engineers stating that the delegates would consult their constituentson Tuesday morning.Dr. z\ddison said he thought that the Executive of the society and the delegates were not at one on the subject, and he believedthat the men would yield if the Government took a firm line ; but itwould be absolutely necessary to stand by the pledge given at theConference, and allow the constituencies to be consulted. This view was shared by Mr. Sbackleton.General Geddes explained that the recruiting machine was bigand ponderous, and required considerable time and preparation toset it going properly. In response to the decision of the Cabinet onthe 22nd March, the machinery had been changed from a geo-graphical to an occupational basis, and would be in full working order by Tuesday next. There were over 200,000 unexpired notices,70,000 temporary exemptions, and 22,000 substitution cases ready tobe dealt with. To stop the machine in the interests of the Engineerswould involve other Unions also. The only way it could now bedone would be to grant a week&apos;s leave to all and have no recruitsnext week. It would be impossible for such a huge organisation to discriminate between one class of workmen and another, or oneworkshop and another. This proposal would throw back thetraining of approximately 120,000 men for a week.In the course of the discussion which followed it was generally recognised that any action which would stop the flow of recruits ata moment when the Army, already somewhat short of drafts, is engaged in a great offensive was to be deprecated. It was furtherrecognised that to postpone the taking in of recruits who hadrelinquished their employment would cause considerable hardshipand dissatisfaction, and that the men who were treated in this mannerwould provide a good field for the activities of agitators. Neverthe-less, it was agreed that to take any action during the coming week(which includes Labour Day) calculated to increase the resentfultemper now prevailing, or to cause a strike which would, delayshipbuilding and the output of munitions, would be a still greater
timber Supplies 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a suggestion thatthe bonus system should be applied to soldiers, in order to stimulate the production of timber (Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War, Paper G.-T. 524, last paragraph). While recog-recognising the possibility of a demand for the extension of the principle to cases other than those indicated by Lord Derby in his Memoran-dum, the War Cabinet, in view of the urgent need for timber,approved the payment of a bonus as proposed.Grain for Horses. 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Inter-departmental Committee appointed to consider economies in theuse of grain for horses, and to direct a census of horses (paper g.-T. 503) (War Cabinet S3, Minute 10), together with a Memorandumby Mr. R. H. Selbie, and covering Notes by the President of, theBoard of Trade (Papers G.-T. 551 and 559).The War Cabinet took note of the strong feeling which hasbeen shown in the House of Commons against the continuance of horse-racing. While recognising that the stoppage of horse-racingwould not produce any very appreciable reduction in the consump-tion of grainstuff for human use, they considered that to permithorse-racing to continue would tend to induce a belief in the public mind that the food situation was less serious than had been repre-sented, and to that extent would stultify Lord Devonport&apos;s efforts tosecure economy in its use.In view of the serious food situation prevailing in the country,as shown in the reports of the Food Controller and of the Committeeabove referred to, the War Cabinet requested Lord Devonport to communicate to the Jockey Club their decision that after next week horse-racing shall ceasethroughout the United Kingdom until further notice.Lord Devonport was also authorised to conclude arrangements with the Jockey Club for the rationing of thoroughbredanimals.Further action in the direction of economising grain for horsesas recommended by the Departmental Committee was approved, and the matter was referred to Lord Devonportand Sir A. H. Stanley with authority to take the necessary action to give effect to the recommendation.mbargo on the. 4. The Secretary read a communication he had received fromstuffs the FFst Se.a Lord/inviting the attention of the War Cabinet to a,&apos; v case in which a Norwegian ship had been granted permission to(aJiA&amp;u*.tCCiij  ) carry considerable quantities of foodstuffs, in excess of her own/ requirements, for the use of South Georgia Island.   Although,thanks to the representations of the Senior Naval Officer at Liverpool,the licence had subsequently been cancelled, the First Sea Lord[1365-127] &quot; B 2evil.   Moreover, it was considered that the postponement for a week would, in the long run, probably produce more recruits.The War Cabinet decided that A Circular should he prepared by a Committee consisting ofMr. Henderson, Dr. Aclclison, Mr. Shackleton, and GeneralGeddes, with Mr. G. M. Young as Secretary. The Circularshould indicate that the War Cabinet was not recedingfrom its decision, had confirmed the undertaking given atyesterday&apos;s Conference, and would postpone for ene week the recruitment of men who had been called to the Coloursso as to permit of the difficulties of inaugurating thescheme being surmounted (Appendix I).
asked that, as a matter of principle, the War Cabinet should give an instruction that do exportation of foodstuffs was to be permitted.The Food Controller reported that he had already taken action with the Board of Customs and Excise to ensure this.        *Prisoners of War:Their Employmentin the Firms; Zone.5. The discussion was resumed from the Meeting held on th30th March, 1917 (War Cabinet 109, Minute 4), when it was decidedthat the Secretary of State for War should look fully into the matter&apos; and report to the War Cabinet.Lord Derby stated that he had received information from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to the effect that it had been decided towithdraw all German prisoners, both in the French and Britishzones of operations in France, employed in the rear of the frontlines and in the lines of communication, to a distance of 30 kilometres from the firing line.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary of State for War to arrange, in concert with LordNewton, and through the proper diplomatic channels, thatthe German Government be notified accordingly.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,April 28, 1917.IsVct]0Pdifr
APPENDIX I.Schedule of Protected Occupations.(See Minute 1.)IN consequsnee of certain unavoidable delays which have arisen in setting up themachinery for the protection of men engaged in vital industries who come under the;new Schedule of Protected Occupations, the Government have decided to postpone forone week, with the exception set out below, the recruitment of men who have been called to the Colours and are under orders to report during the week beginning the30th April.The Schedule will come into operation on the 7th May (not on the 1st May as setout in the Schedule and explanatory handbills already circulated), and men called upfor military service on the 30th April will therefore be required to present themselves at the place specified in the notice On the 7th May, men called up for the 1st Maj^ onthe Sth May, and so forth.Instructions to this effect are being issued to all recruiting offices for communication to men affected.The exception referred to above is that the postponement does not apply to menwho have held an exemption granted by a tribunal.These men will be required to report at the place and on the date stated in theirealling-up notices.Notwithstanding this announcement, any man who so desires may report in theordinary course at the recruiting office.Until the 7th May the existing method of protection will continue in operation.APPENDIX II.Embargo on the Export of Foodstuffs.(See Minute 4.)(A.)Dear Hankey, April 27, 1017.THE First Sea Lord......is most anxious to point out that foodstuffs arestill being taken out of the country, in addition to the important objection mentionedin the telegram.He asks that the matter may be put before the War Cabinet, so that orders maybe given to stop tliis procedure at once. In the meantime, he has telegraphed to the senior Naval Officer at Liverpool to suspend embarkation of the foodstuffs.Yours sincerely,H. H. SHARE.Licence, dated the 25th April, granted to Burnyeat and Dalzell, of Liverpool, forprovisions consigned to the Tonsberg Whaling Company, South Georgia Island, onsteamship &quot; Orwell.&quot;The goods were required for stores for the crews of vessels engaged in thewhaling industry in South Georgia. The whale-oil so procured is brought to thiscountry for the use of the Ministry of Munitions, who consequently strongly supported the application. It was suggested, nevertheless, to the applicants that they should obtain these stores from abroad, but they replied that this was not practicable as itwas very importaut that the steamship &quot;Orwell&quot; should get supplies in England and proceed direct, in order to save time.Commander Longden, R.N., called here this morning and drew attention to thedanger involved in allowing this export, and a telegram was immediately despatchedfrom this Department to the Customs, asking them to refuse shipment.C. W. R. PRESCOTT, Private Secretary,Director, War Trade Department.April 27, 1917.
