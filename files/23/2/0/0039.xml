Conference withthe French and italians:Postponement ofthe Meetings of theImperial WarCabinet.1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 119,  Minute 14, thePrime Minister informed the War Cabinet that the date of bisConference  with   Representatives  of  tbe  Prencb  and   italian governments bad been advanced, and that he would have to leave *England at once.In these circumstances the War Cabinet decided that The next Meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet, the membersof which are very fully occupied with the work of theCommittees on Peace desiderata, should be postponed until the following week.The Secretary was instructed to communicate,this decision to members of the Imperial War Cabinet, explaining thereasons.f. &quot;\The western front.2. The Director of Military Operations reported that theErench attack had progressed satisfactorily north-east of Rheims,but not so well in the direction of X-aon, where the main advance was intended to be made. The most encouraging feature was thenumber of prisoners, reported to be 10,000 men out of a total of62,000 German infantry estimated to have been engaged.3. The War Cabinet instructed the Director of MilitaryOperations to impress on Lieut.-General Sir H. Wilson theimportance of communicating full information as soon as possible,for their use.Casualties.4. The Director of Military Operations reported that up to last night the casualties on the British Eront were 45,000. he further stated that the British operations were being delayed bybad weather.East Africa.5. The Director of Military Operations stated that GeneralHoskins had asked that five ships, one of 5,000 tons, and two of1,500 tons (for the transport of troops), and one of 7,000 tons (forthe conveyance of railway material) might be released in connectionwith the operations in East Africa. He pointed out that if general Hoskins&apos; request could be met now, the campaign mightbe wound up in the near future and large quantities of shipping,at present tied up for the purposes of this Expedition, madeavailable for utilisation in other ways.The Shipping Controller said that, in view of the very seriousshipping situation, it would be most difficult to find the requiredtonnage. He was at present engaged in trying to release shipping from the Eastern seas for the purpose.The War Cabinet authorised The Shipping Controller to provide this tonnage if this couldbe done consistently with the maintenance of our food supply and other essential services.The transport&quot; Cameronia.&quot;6. With reference to War Cabinet 119, Minute 20, the EirstSea Lord reported that the majority of the troops on the transport&quot; Cameronia &quot; had been saved.Loss of submarine&quot;C16.&quot; &quot;C7. The Eirst Sea Lord16&quot;   had  been  sunkstated that the British Submarineas  the result  of a collision, while
submerged, with a British destroyer. A salvage ship had beensent to the spot, but there was not much hope of saving the crewor the submarine. . ,Loss of Norwegiansteamers.8. The Fh&apos;st Sea Lord gave his usual list of losses fromsubmarine warfare, including four Norwegian steamers, all sunk inthe same vicinity, 30 miles out of the protected course which hadbeen prescribed by the Admiralty.Hospital ships:Reprisals.Austrian peace proposals.9. The First Sea Lord drew the attention of the War Cabinetto the comments circulated by the German wireless system(Appendix; I) in regard to the aerial attack on Freiburg, deliveredas an act of retaliation for the sinking by the Germans of hospital ships.10. The War Cabinet discussed briefly the question of therumoured offer by Austria to Russia of a separate peace, as reportedin the newspapers.The First Sea Lord gave reasons why, from a naval point ofview, it would be very advantageous if Austria withdrew from thewar.The Director of Military Operations was of opinion that ifAustria made an independent peace with Russia, and Germanystill remained at war, the results, from a military aspect, wouldprobably be beneficial.The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that he was onthe point of starting for Italy in order to take part in a Conference(see Minute 1 above) with the French and Italian Governments,and stated that, as Italy was more directly concerned in this matterthan either France or England, the Italian -Representative wouldbe certain to ask to be informed as to the views of the BritishGovernment. lie wished, therefore, to be acquainted with the expert opinions of the naval and military authorities on a possibleseparate peace, whether proposals had been put forward by Austriaacting independently, or in collusion with Germany.The Director of Military Operations undertook that either he or the Chief of the Imperial General Staff would immediately consider the question, and give the PrimeMinister the views of the General Staff personally before he left for France.The protection of n, The War Cabinet approved the scheme for the control of fishing vessels. steam trawlers, set forth in a Memorandum by the Admiralty,dated the 10th April, 1917 (Paper G.T.-414), which it is hoped wiUprovide not only for increased safety, but also for the supply of alarger quantity of fish.curing fish.n    ^ ^e ^ ar Cabinet approved in principle a proposal of thePresident of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for providingmeans for collecting, distributing, storing, curing, and otherwisehandling and marketing tish in order to avoid waste at the ports,and to secure the greatest possible benefit from existing machinery and man-power ; the Treasury to be informed as to the nature ofthe expenditure (Appendix II).[1365-121]
Nationalisation ofshipping:Limitation ofshipping profits.13. With reference to War Cabinet 62, Minute 4, the WarCabinet had before them three Papers on the subject of Limitationof Shipping Profits (Papers G.T.-393, G.T.-413, and G.T.-426).The   Shipping  Controller  stated   that  practically all  the^mercantile fleet of the country was now under requisition at BlueBook rates, and that therefore the situation was different from what it was when the question was discussed by the War Cabinet on the12th February. fWith regard to the average profits, it was pointed out that thewere as follows : estimated figures190919101911191219136   per cent.8-310-513-1165Jor an average of just over 10 per cent, for the five years preceding the war.Some discussion took place as to whether the profits should now be limited to the figures for 1913, viz., 16 per cent., or for thethree years preceding war, say, 13 per cent., or for the five years,say, 10 per cent.The War Cabinet decided that The question of limiting profits should be settled by theChancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Henderson, in con-sultation with the Shipping Controller, the decision to be reported to the War Cabinet at an early date.Delay at Swansea.Steamship&quot; Cranley.&quot;14. The War Cabinet took note of the case of the steamship&quot; Cranley,&quot; a Canadian store ship which arrived at Swansea on the26th March, but did not sail again until the 12th April, althoughshe had been sent to Swansea with the idea of getting good despatch.The reason for the delay had been that there was a good deal ofLabour trouble at Swansea.The Shipping Controller undertook to investigate the matter further, and to report the result in due course to the WarCabinet.(Initialled) A.

APPENDIX I.News from Berlin sent through the Wireless Stations of the German Government.ON the 14th April, at noon, a hostile squadron composed of twelveaeroplanes attacked the open town of Ereiburg. The attack was repeated at 5 p.m.by two more squadrons, with altogether twenty-three machines. Several human liveswere sacrificed to this iniquitous attack : seven women, three men, and one soldierwere killed ; seventeen women, eight men, and two children were wounded. Thehostile flyers also aimed at the new theatre, the University, and the clinics.The anatomy section was considerably damaged. The attack was not fully carriedout, thanks to our efficient counter-measures. During air-combats with our defensiveflyers, two hostile machines were shot down near Schletstadt and Markirch. A thirdfell down in air combat with the assistance of anti-aircraft guns. It is characteristicthat the three machines brought down wrere British with British crews. TheCommander of the attack, a British Lieutenant-Colonel, fell into our hands.According to his declaration and to the text of a pamphlet dropped the attack wasa reprisal for the torpedoing of the &quot; Gloucester Castle.&quot; The justification of such a formation is most categorically contested. Our Government communicated in time toEngland, that the plying of so-called hospital ships could not he further toleratedwithin the exactly delineated zone. If the British, nevertheless, do not heed ourwarning, and misuse the Red Cross and undertake transports in the barred zone, theymust bear the consequences of their proceeding. It is cheap glory to &quot;attack opentowns for vengeance. At Ereiburg, there are no objects of military importance whichcould justify this attack, which is thus a worthy successor of other attacks againstdefenceless villages in Southern Germany, which are not justified by anything, and area sad paragon [sic] to the assassination of children at Karlsruhe on the 22nd june last year.APPENDIX II.G.T.-455. -The Fishing Industry.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.BEFORE the war the average quantity of fish, as distinguished from sheU-fish,annually landed by fishing-vessels in the United Kingdom was 1,000,000 tons.   .Of this 1,000,000 tons, 40 per cent, was exported. The remaining 600,000 tons was consumed in the United Kingdom. Roughly speaking, this amount equals one-third of the annual meat consumption.In 1916 the landings of fish have fallen to 400,000 tons, thus reducing the quantityavailable for home consumption by one-third, and allowing nothing for export.With the reduced number of fishing-vessels and the diminished crews it becomesvery important to maintain, and if possible to increase, this output.The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries thinks that much greater quantities of fishcould be brought in if a market were assured. This is especially true of mackerel,pilchards, and herrings, of which, at certain seasons, in certain localities, there is oftena glut.Acting through the Fish Committee, and supplementing rather than supplantingthe existing channels of trade distribution, the Board wishes to be able to obtain thegreatest possible output of fish, and secure that the fish shall either reach the consumerimmediately or be preserved for future use. For these purposes the Board asks to beplaced in such a financial position as to be able to employ fish merchants to handle thefish for them; to employ or subsidise curers either for light curing or for more permanent forms of preservation ; to employ or subsidise canners to tin surplus* supplies and hold them at the Governments disposal; to rent cold storage, when theoccasion arises, in which to hold fish ; to hire motor carriers to coUect fish ; to purchaseboxes and other receptacles, ice, salt, &amp;c, in order to secure the supply of thesenecessaries wherever required ; to hire suitable empty buildings, sheds, &amp;c, where itappears to be desirable, in order to provide smoking accommodation; and generally totake such steps as the occasion demands to utilise our fish supply to the best possibleadvantage.In order to carry out these objects the Board asks that the Treasury shouldadvance money, 10,OOOL at a time, up to a limit of, say, 100,000LR.
