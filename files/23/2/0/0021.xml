Organisation of 1. THE War Cabinet received and approved&apos; Mr. Henderson&apos;national Service. Report containing proposals with regard to the relations between theDepartment of National Service, the Ministry of Labour, and otherDepartments concerned in the question of Man-Power. The Report(Q-.T. 245) is printed as Appendix I.Man-Power. 2. The War Cabinet began the consideration of the Report ofLord Rhondda&apos;s Committee (G.T. 244) (Appendix II). The WarCabinet decided, with regard to paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, that , (a.) Having regard to the strong feeling existing in the country on the subject of Industrial Compulsion, it was impos-sible to proceed with any scheme for the compulsorytransfer and allocation of civilian labour until it hadbeen demonstrated by experience that voluntary enrol-ment, reinforced by the restriction of less important industries in respect of labour, material, and transport,was incapable of yielding the necessary supplies.(o.) The Director-General of National Service should proceed at ionce with his proposal under which, in addition to theexisting scheme of National Service &quot;Volunteers, specialappeals are to be made for substitution volunteers totake the place of eligible men released from essential industries for military service.(c.) The Trade Card Scheme should be superseded by a schedule of occupations and age limits.&apos;*(d.) The schedule of occupations and age limits as printed and circulated to the Cabinet should be adopted.(e.) Before any announcement is made or action taken under(c) and (d\ Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee should meet again to consider, in consultation with Mr. Hendersonand the other Ministers concerned in the introduction ofthe Trade Card Scheme, what communication should bemade to the Trade Unions, the form in which it shouldbe made, and the machinery for protecting workmenengaged in the scheduled industries from wrongfulenlistment, with special reference to the case of men employed in shipbuilding and repairing, and marine engineering shops.3. The War Cabinet reserved for consideration at an earlydate : (a.) The question of the quota to be released from the severalprotected industries (Appendix &quot; A &quot; of the Report) ;(6.) The question of extending to resident aliens of allied countries the liability to serve with the Forces(paragraph 4) :(c.) The draft Bill to amend the Military Service Acts(paragraph 5);(d.) The question of economy in the use of man-power by theArmy (paragraph 6).* This decision was taken by the War Cabinet after the other Ministers and officials in attendance had withdrawn.
6s4Prosecution of 5. At the instance of &quot;the   Minister of Blockade, the War&quot;The Morning Cabinet authorised-Post.&quot;The prosecution of &quot; The Morning Post &quot; for an infringement ofthe Defence of the Realm Act in respect of the publicationof false information on the subject of the Blockade, pro-vided the Law Officer advised that there had been anundoubted breach of the law and that a conviction was certain.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 23, 1917.Exemption of 4. The War Cabinet decided that Inland Revenue The appeal by t e Treasury against the decision of the Directoru of National Service with regard to the release of certainofficials of the Board  of Inland  Revenue for MilitaryService  should be  determined by the Prime Ministerf; after hearing the views of the Chairman and Vice-Chairmanof the Board.
APPENDIX I.. G.T.-245.--- .Organisation of National Service.(Report by Mr. Henderson.)&quot; THE War Cabinet, having regard to the importance of securing completeco-ordination between the Departments of National Service and the Ministry of Labour,especially with regard to the part to be taken by the Employment Exchanges on theallocation of National Service Volunteers, decided that Mr. Henderson, on behalf ofthe Cabinet, should confer with the heads of the two Departments and of any otherDepartments which might be affected, with a view to securing thorough co-ordinationof their activities.&quot;   (War Cabinet 98, Minute 13.)In accordance with this instruction, I saw Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Hodge, withtheir officials, on Saturday, the 17th March, and discussed the relations between their departments.On Tuesday, the 20th March, I again met Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Hodge, withrepresentatives of the principal employing Departments, namely, the Ministry ofMunitions, Air Board, Admiralty, and Shipping Controller. At this meeting we considered the relations which should exist between these Departments on one side,and the Department of National Service and the Ministry of Labour on the other.It was clear that there were no important differences of principle or methodbetween St. Ermin&apos;s and the Ministry of Labour. Both Departments recognise thattheir relations are governed by the decision of the Cabinet that the EmploymentExchanges should remain under the control of the Minister of Labour, who undertook to place them at the disposal of the Director for the purposes of National Service.What is principally required is a more precise demarcation of jurisdictions andarrangements for adjusting incidental difficulties and for securing regular inter-communication across the dividing lines.After careful consideration, I believe that the following arrangements are bestadapted to secure efficient and harmonious administration, and I accordingly recommend them to the Cabinet.The Department of National Service.The primary function of this Department is to collect labour for national purposes.Mr. Chamberlain should therefore be responsible to the War Cabinet for all measuresleading up to the enrolment of the volunteers, including publicity and propaganda, thescheduling of industries according to their degree of national importance, andthe promulgation of orders or regulations which have for their object the diversion oflabour from the less to the more essential employments. After enrolment, he should determine all questions affecting the rights or status of a National Service volunteerunder his agreement, including appeals against removal, the settlement of disputes asto wages, and the determination of subsistence and travelling allowances. It shouldbe his duty to report periodically, to the Cabinet and to the Dej)departments affected, thenumber of volunteers enrolled, the. number pi^imd facie available for transfer, andthe occupations for which they can be regarded as available.Conversely, all prospective demands for labour should be communicated to theDirector by the Departments in order that he may be in a position to watch the movement of labour generally, and to frame his measures for the restriction ofindustries accordingly.The Ministry of Labour.The primary function of this Department is to place labour for national purposes.The Employment Department of the Ministry should therefore be responsible for ^meeting individual demands for labour, whether from among the number of NationalService Volunteers, War Munition Volunteers, or the general pool. It should alsocarry out the process of substitution as part of its ordinary business of placing labour,and all officials engaged on that work should be under the j urisdiction of the &quot;Ministryof Labour.
In this connection I should like to call attention to the proposal put&apos; forward bythe Director and supported by the majority of Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee, under which special appeals should be directed to particular trades which are likely to yield suitablemen as substitution volunteers to take the place of eligible men released from essential industries. On the whole, this proposal appears to me to be the most likely to provide asolution of the problem of industrial man-power. I agree, moreover, that the appeal would be most effective if made through local joint committees of employers andemployed, and I think that such committees should be invited to take an active share in the business of selecting and transferring the men. But the actual process ought tobe carried out by the Exchanges, which alone can provide the necessary machinery.Otherwise there would be two systems running side by side, one for ordinary volunteers and one for substitution volunteers, and the result would be confusion.Co-ordination of Tioo Departments.It has been suggested to me, and I entirely approve the proposal, that there shouldbe a Joint Executive Committee of the two Departments, meeting at regular intervalsto consider questions of policy, and to effect such adjustments of practice or procedurewithin the terms of the Cabinet decision as the development of National Service mayrender desirable. The Committee might consist of representatives of each Department,with Mr. Chamberlain as Chairman and Mr. Bridgeman as Vice-Chairman, and shouldhave as its Secretary an official of some standing, whose duty it would be to maintaincontact between the Departments.One of the first questions to which the Committee should direct its attention is thedistribution of duties among the&apos; staff of the two Departments. Hitherto there hasbeen a certain amount of duplication of work, and it appears probable that considerableeconomies might be effected by a more careful delimitation of function and the transferof part of the staff of St. Ermin&apos;s to the Employment Department.Other Departments.The Priority Committee of the Ministry of Munitions should continue to settle all questions of priority within the Departments represented on it, but a representative of ,the National Service Department should be added. In any case where the Director isnotified of a prospective demand for labour from any other Department, he should havethe right to summon the Priority Committee, which should then meet under his chairmanship with two representatives of the Department affected, and determine thequestion of the priority to be accorded to the demand.No arrangements for the withdrawal of men in bulk from one industry to another(apart from the ordinary removals of volunteers through the Employment Department)should be undertaken by the Director without the concurrence of the Departmentsaffected or by the Department without the concurrence of the Director.The Minister of Labour and Mr. Chamberlain have seen and concurred in thisreport.(Initialled) A. H.March 22, 1917.
APPENDIX II.Military Service : Exemptions.(Report of Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee.)I HAVE to report that, in accordance with, the directions of the War Cabinet,meetings have been held which have been attended by representatives of the Depart-ments particularly concerned with exemptions ; and that we have come to the following conclusions: 1. We are informed by the Army Council that 555,000 A and B i men will he required during the four months of April to July inclusive. We have not deemed itto be our function to enquire whether this number is justified or can safely be reduced.Most of the fit men of military age now left in civil life are in protected industries.We are informed that,, broadly speaking, the number of fit men in civil life amounts tosome 2,000,000, and that over 1,500,000 of this total are in protected industries. Ofthe fit men under 31 years of age, the number in civil life is estimated at about700,000, of whom well over 650,000 are in protected industries.After allowing for the men whom the Army Council expect to obtain from other sources (including youths who attain the age of 18 years and men who will be yieldedby Tribunals), 330,000 men fit for general service should be obtained from the protectedindustries if the requirements of the Army Council are to be met.We are not satisfied that to take this number would not gravely endanger thesupply of essential needs ; and we recommend that the Departments should not berequired to release more than about 250,000 men fit for general service during the four months in question from the groups of industries indicated in appendix A tq thisReport, the men to be surrendered from the various groups in the manner set out in theappendix. We do not suggest any fresh proposals as regards the release of men from agriculture or the mercantile marine ; but consider that the Army Council shouldbe allowed to continue recruiting from these classes under any interdepartmentalarrangements which may exist or may be made.2. The men to be obtained under our proposals from the protected industries canbe yielded only if an adequate supply of reasonably competent substitutes, of whom alarge proportion must be of good physique, is forthcoming.We suggest that the position be put clearly before^ Parliament, and that it be pointed out that there are only three possible courses now open to the country: (a.) To take no action and to allow the armies to dwindle, or else to instruct the commanders-in-Chief in the field to avoid casualties ;(6.) To raise the military age;(c.) To introduce some method of  redistributing available labour so  as  to concentrate it in essential industries.The Army Council have urged the adoption of the second course, not so muchwith the idea of placing the older men in the Army as of applying indirect pressure to induce them to enter employment in the essential industries in substitution foryounger men now protected who would then be withdrawn. They would therefore propose that this measure should be accompanied by a vigorous combing out of youngmen in essential industries, and by the granting of conditional exemption to men overthe present military age who are prepared to act as substitutes for young men in essential industries. We recognise that there is much to be said for this view, hut it is ineffect industrial compulsion disguised as military service. The general feeling of the .Conference was against the proposal. If industrial compulsion is necessary, thenecessity should be openly declared. We think that the opposition which must in anycase be anticipated would only be increased by this attempt to disguise its real nature.In these circumstances we favour the third course (e).It is of vital importance to expedite substitution by withdrawing, by degrees, themen required for military purposes from the protected industries in advance of theprovision and submission of substitutes, and thus to create and maintain a vacuum
6Sin the&apos; protected industries which would automatically draw in the substitutes whenavailable; provision to secure this end is contained in the scheme for releasing men(appendix A). As long as no labour vacuum is created in the protected trades, so longwill employers continue successfully to evade the acceptance of substitutes for themen who should be released for military service.The Conference generally had grave doubts whether suitable substitutes in\) adequate numbers would be forthcoming without the adoption of compulsion for restricting unessential industries and for transferring men from unessential to essential work. Having regard, however, to recent pledges and to what transpired during thepast week or two in the discussions on the National Service Bill in the House ofCommons, the majority of the members felt that any measure of compulsion of thiskind was at present impracticable; and therefore they supported a proposal putforward by the Director-General of National Service under which, in addition to theexisting scheme of National Service Volunteers, special appeals are to be made forSubstitution Volunteers to take the place of eligible men released from essential industries for military service. It is proposed that these appeals should be directed to particular trades likely to yield suitable men of the kind required; that they shouldbe made through local committees representative of employers and employed in eachof the trades ; and that the selection and transfer of the men to be placed as SubstitutionVolunteers should be carried out by these committees. If after a limited period themethod could be shown to have failed, the case for compulsion would then beoverwhelming and should command general assent.3. The Trade Card scheme should be superseded by the schedule of occupations,with age limits, submitted with this report (appendix B).tThe Trade Unions concerned must be informed before the new arrangements are brought into force. We understand that the Government have under consideration anumber of other important proposals affecting Trade Unions. We suggest that all theproposals should be put before the Unions at the same time.4. Liability to serve with the forces should be extended to friendly aliens ofAllied countries who are resident in this country. It may be necessary to have reciprocal arrangements with Allied countries. We think that the best plan would be to take. power to apply compulsion by Order to British subjects in any particular foreign country. The position of Irishmen and colonials resident in foreign countries wouldhave to be considered in this connection.5. A draft Bill is annexed (appendix C)t for some minor amendments in theMilitary Service Acts ; among the proposals are (a) the reduction of the period of graceallowed after the expiration of an exemption from two weeks or, in certain classes ofcases, two months to seven days ; and (b) the giving of power to the Army Council torequire a rejected man to be re-examined after not less than six months, and adischarged man after not less than twelve months, from his rejection or discharge.6. We think that we should be authorised to review the position at the end of amonth in the light of the further information which should then be available as to military and industrial requirements.In conclusion, we would venture to press very strongly on the War Cabinet thatthe strain on the man-power of the country is becoming acute, especially in view of theheavy industrial and financial responsibilities which have to be borne by this country ;and that, therefore, it is imperative that more men should not be taken for militaryservice than are really needed, and that there should be the fullest economy in theuse of man-power, not only in industry, but also in the Army.R.*March 21, 1917.* I have signed the Report as Chairman of the Conference; but I dissent from section 2 of the Reportin that I consider the adoption of compulsion necessary for the provision of suitable substitutes in adequatenumbers.   Mr. Sliackleton wishes to state that this is also his view.f Not reproduced.
Minority Report Submitted on Behalf of the Admiralty;, the Army Council,and the Ministry of Munitions.1. THE Admiralty, the War Office, and the Ministry of Munitions are unable fully to concur in the report submitted by the Conference.The three Departments concur in paragraphs 1, 4, 5, and 6 of the report.They disagree with paragraph 2 as from the end of sub-section (c) and provisionallydisagree with paragraph 3.2. In the opinion of the three Departments, the one fact clearly established by theConference was If the Armies in the field are not to dwindle, if the necessary ships are to be built, if munitions, aeroplanes, &amp;c, are to be provided, young fit men now engaged inessential industries must be recruited and their places must be taken by older men orby young unfit men.The problem, therefore, is to organise effective and certain substitution.3. Effective and certain substitution cannot be secured on a voluntary basis tomeet the requirements.The substitutes must be secured on a scientific plan. The non-essential occupationsmust be carefully scrutinised and scheduled to indicate those in which working conditions are as nearly similar as may be to those in occupations under the admiralty and Ministry of Munitions for which substitutes are required.In this way and in no other way can substitutes be obtained who, from the nature and environment of their ordinary work, are suitable for introduction into theoccupations from which men are being released for military service.4. It is wholly impossible to effect substitution by creating a vacuum, e.g., in steel production, aeroplane and gun shops, without reducing deliveries to His Majesty&apos;forces.It is undoubted that to create a vacuum will facilitate substitution, but output willbe temporarily affected.It is impossible for the Departments concerned to risk a diminution in the outputof war machines of all sorts. Further, the equipment of the Allies is only second in importance to the equipment of the British forces by sea and land.5. The War Office believes that the simplest and most direct way of solving thepresent problems is to raise the military age immediately to 45, with powers to raisethe age to 50 by Order in Council.This measure would demand no new administrative machinery to make it effective.It would yield both recruits and a mass of men who in exchange for conditionalexemption would be prepared to act as substitutes. The report states that this is anattempt to introduce industrial compulsion.If this contention be correct, industrial compulsion has been in force for approxi-mately twelve months. Tens of thousands of men are at present engaged in civiloccupations holding exemptions conditional on their remaining in that occupation.The indirect effect of the Military Service Acts has in this manner provided handsfor shipyards, munition works, coal mines, and other work of national importance, andwill continue to do so as long as the grant of conditional exemption is legal .The&quot; War Office urge that the advantage of adopting the course proposed by them is, as above stated, that no new administrative machinery is required, and that there forfeit may reasonably be expected to yield almost immediate results. It is fully recognisedthat if sueh a proposal were to be adopted the whole situation would require to be fully explained to Parliament.It is a matter of record that Parliament never seriously objected to the War OfficeSubstitution Scheme, which was based upon the grant of conditional exemption to menof military age acting as substitutes.6. As the suggestion to raise the Military age was not approved by the Conference,the three Departments would urge upon the Cabinet the immediate adoption of some measure to obtain&apos;with certainty the substitutes required. If the provision of suchsubstitutes be certain, the Admiralty, War Office, and Ministry of Munitions havemutually agreed that they can adopt a procedure on the basis of the memorandum ofagreement and schedule forming appendix B of the general report, which, in their view, will obtain men for the Army from the e essential industries in which the three departments arejjointly or severally concerned.7. The inter-departmental agreement is based wholly upon the certain provision of effective substitutes which was understood by the Departments to have been accepted
as fundamental by the Conference at its first meeting. From this the Conferencedeparted at its last meeting by a narrow majority composed of the Department ofNational Service, the India Office, the Board of Trade, and the Scottish Office. TheHome Office did not vote, and the Ministry of Shipping was against immediate&apos;compulsion on political grounds.The Ministry of Fabour and the Board of Agriculture were not represented at the) meeting at which the change of plan was adopted.The Focal Government Board was in favour of compulsion.8. The Admiralty, War Office, and Ministry of Munitions desire to place it clearlyon record that, in their considered opinion, the certain provision of effective substitutesin adequate numbers to replace the young fit men now employed in essential, industries is an urgent matter of the first importance, on which the successful,termination of thewar directly depends.Appendix A to Ford Rhondda&apos;s Report.Method of Releasing Men from Protected Industries.MEN are to be released from the several groups of protected industries duringthe four months April to July, as shown in the table below. A quarter of the men areto be released from each group each month.Group.Number ofMen ofMilitary Age.To be Eeleasedfor MilitaryService.Bad^ed men, including men badged by the Ministryof Munitions for other departments, but excludingmen in shipbuilding and marine engineering&apos;works and men badged directly by the AdmiraltyOoal minesRailwaysDock labourPoliceCivil ServiceOther certified occupations, excluding agriculture,mercantile marine, shipbuilding and marineengineeringTotal700,000450,000210,00043,00025,00050,000400,000124,00055,000*21.0007,000l,000t2,00040,0001,878,000250,000* In fixing this quota account has been taken of the fact that, under existing- agreements, arrange-ments have been made to provide from coal mines 20,000 men for the Army, 6,000 for timber cutting,and 4,000 for iron stone mining.f Subject to the provision that the military authorities shall be entitled to claim additional men fromthe police force for military service to the number of members of the Metropolitan Police Force who arereleased from guarding naval and military establishments (2,700 members of the Metropolitan Police force are now so employed).The release of the men is not to be dependent on the prior provision of a substi-tute for any man, and the quota for each month is to be released as a matter ofcourse, subject to the following provision if by the end of a month&apos;it has been foundthat sufficient substitutes have not.been available during the month, the number ofmen to be released for the next month shall be reconsidered.*It will be seen that some groups of industries are being required to surrender alarger proportion of men than others. The numbers were fixed after considerationof the representations received from the several Departments. A copy of these representations is annexed (appendix D).tThe several Departments should agree with the Army Council within one week asto schedules of occupations, with age limits, for releasing their quota of the men nowprotected by them.It will be well that employers&apos; organisations and trade unions affected by the new arrangements should be informed before any public announcement is made.* For the men to be released by the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty, this matter is regulated-by the memorandum of agreement which prefaces the schedule of occupations (appendix B). -] Not reproduced.
Reservation by the Home Office as regards Coal Mines.The Home Office is unable to concur in the report, so far as the coal-miningindustry is concerned.The industry has recruited heavily, and the following further demands havealready been made this year : (i) 20,000 men for the army ; (ii) 6,000 to 10,000 to cut timber for pit-props; (iii) 4,000 for the iron-stone mines. The release of 55,000 men would mean a further reduction in the output of coal of 16,500,000 tons.The coal industry differs from the other protected industries in that substitutionis possible only to a very limited extent. It is estimated by the inspectors of minesthat only 25,000 out of the 750,000 men at present employed below ground could bereplaced by substitutes if they were available.Further, the experience in connection with the existing schemes for substitutionamong the surface workers has been very discouraging, and the Home Office is ofopinion that it would be impossible to obtain substitutes for underground work except under a measure of compulsion. On this point the Home Office is in agreement withthe report presented by the War Office, Admiralty, and Ministry of Munitions,Assuming, however, that substitution could be carried out to the full extentindicated (25,000), the loss of output would still be about 9 million tons.This loss would have to be shared between all or some of the following interests : 1. The domestic consumer and the less essential industries.2. Munition works and other essential industries.3. The Navy.4. The Allies.(The reduction of export to neutrals resulting from the submarine campaign hasalready been allowed for in the release of the men indicated in the second paragraphabove.)Substantial reductions in domestic consumption have already been brought about by high prices and shortage of supplies, but further economies could no doubt still beeffected if drastic restrictions were put in force by the Government both as regardsdomestic consumption and as regards the unessential industries. The extent of theseit is impossible to estimate, but it is probable that they would fall considerably short of 9 million tons, and the balance wordd in that case have to be met by reducing thesupplies to the essential trades, the Navy, or the Allies.It must be pointed out that no scheme for economies has yet been decided on.The conclusion would appear to be that, assuming adoption of measures for compulsory provision of substitutes and economies in use of coal, not more &quot;than45,000 men can safely he taken, or, if compulsory provision of substitutes is not adopted and economies only are relied on, not more than 20,000.March 22, 1917.o
