THE Secretary of State for Home Affairs reported that hehad settled with the Eood Controller the terms of the Order for therestriction of the output of liquor, in accordance with the decisionof the Cabinet (War Cabinet 102, Minute 17).The War Cabinet authorised the issue of the Order.Liquor Restriction:State Purchase ofthe Liquor Trade.2. In continuation of the discussion on the 22nd March (WarCabinet 102, Minute 17), the War Cabinet further considered thereport of the Home Office Committee appointed to enquire into theposition created by the approved restrictions on the output of beer,spirits, and wines, with special reference to the question of StatePurchase.   (Paper G.T.-241).It was pointed out that the special reasons for adopting apolicy of State Purchase at the present time were : (a.) The urgent need, as a war measure, of exercising control,preventing waste of effort, and saving waste of labour,transport, and food.(b.) The liquor trade is being killed by inches and the goodwill of the licensees is being gradually extinguished, so thatthe owners may he glad to assent to this step.Sir George Cave adduced some evidence in support of this view.[1365-10.6] B
The War Cabinet gave particular attention to the effect on thenational credit, already so heavily strained, of the addition of theestimated sum of 300,000,000Z. It was stated that, in the view of sir george Younger and other experts, State Purchase should constitute a profitable transaction, particularly when the large amount ofwaste involved in competition and in the general conditions of thetrade is taken into account. It was pointed out, however, that thevery fact that State Purchase might be a profitable enterprisewould arouse hostilities in many sections of the TemperanceParty.The evidence before the War Cabinet pointed to the conclusionthat, on the whole, opinion in England (including some of the leadingTemperance organisations) and Ireland would be in favour of StatePurchase, hut the Secretary for Scotland gave a warning that inScotland the opposition would be very strong and general, moreespecially having regard to existing Scottish Temperancelegislation. The War Cabinet recognised, however, the difficultyof differentia ting between the treatment of Scotland and england in regard to beer, owing to the fact that the produce of the Scottishbreweries is sold to a great extent South of the Border.The War Cabinet were imposed*essed with the importance ofmaintaining effective control over the liquor traffic during theperiod of demobilisation, when a natural reaction and the pressure of public opinion : timulated by the Trade to withdraw the presenttemporary restrictions might prove irresistible.Very careful consideration was given to the prospects of passing through Parliament a measure of State Purchase in existing conditions. While recognising that the prospects of its successfulpassage were difficult to calculate, that some attempt might bemade to represent the measure as introducing contentious domesticlegislation in defiance of the understanding to the contrary, andthat the cumulative effect of this, with other controversial measures,might have the result of focussing Parliamentary opposition againstthe Government, the War Cabinet decided that: The case for State Purchase as a war measure when the food,labour, and transport situation is taken into account is so strong, that the Government ought to be prepared, ifthey introduced such a proposal, to face all consequencesand to stand or fall by this policy.There was some discussion on the administrative and financial arrangements. The financial scheme contemplated by the WarCabinet involved the payment of interest to the proprietors duringthe war and the consideration of further financial post bellumarrangements.   Two alternative proposals were made, viz.:  (a.) To exercise control, during the war, under the Defence ofthe llealm Act, with a guaranteed annual payment toshareholders and proprietors, publicans only beingbought out by a cash payment; simultaneously to setup a Committee to consider the basis of compensation ;legislation to be passed on the basis of the Committee&apos;sReport;or, alternatively \(b.) To set up the Committees at once to consider the basis ofcompensation, and to postpone all action until these reports are available.Before taking a final decision either on the principle or onthe administrative machinery, the War Cabinet decided that 
75The Prime Minister should consult his Liberal and Labourcolleagues ou the prospect of passing a measure based onthe three following principles : (a.) State Purchase.J0 (6.) State Management.(c.) Local Option.Company 3  jn connection; with ii question raised by Lord Strachey inTenure by Ministers ^e House of Lords, the War Cabinet considered the question of theof the Crown. tenure of company directorships by Ministers of the Crbwn, and inthis connection they had Before them a siimmary of the policy adopted by previous Governments (Paper G.T.-273, Appendix I).Having carefully Considered a list of the directorships held by-existing Ministers of the Crown, the War Cabinet decided -On the maintenance of: the rule and practice which have solong obtained, namely, that Ministers (including Under-Secretaries) should not hold directorships except in casesof private or philanthropic organisations j and that those ministers who hold Directorships not coming under One orother of these categories should be asked to comply withthe rule.The question whether the reply should be given to-morrow wasreserved.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 2S\ 1917.
APPENDIX T.G.T.-273. -Tenure of Company Directorships by Ministers of the Crown.Memorandum by Mr. Philip Kerr.THIS question has been before Parliament on many occasions in the last twenty years. The last occasion on which there was a public debate was the 19th February,1903, when Mr. Swift MacNeill moved an amendment against the tenure of companydirectorships by Ministers of the Crown. The principle which he maintained wasthat Ministers of the Crown, when they held directorships, could not liberatethemselves from the suspicion that arose &quot;from the conflict of the administration oftheir Departments and their interests as company directors.&quot; &quot; He compared theposition of Ministers with that of civil servants, who were not allowed to be companydirectors.Mr. Balfour, in reply, spoke as follows : &quot; There are only two possible objectionsthat I am able to see to a Minister holding a directorship ; one, that it is likely totake up too much of the time which ought to be devoted to the public service; andthe other, that the mere fact that he is a director may bring him, in that capacity, intocollision with some public interest which he ought to safeguard, or, being connectedwith a company, he may, if that company and its directors become involved in difficulties, through those difficulties bring, I will not say discredit, but may embarrasshis position in the Government and the position of the Government as a whole.&quot; he agreed that no man had the right to join the Government unless he was prepared togive all the time wrhich the duties of his office required. Did that, however, mean that a member of the Government was never to transact any kind of business of hisown ? Was a man on taking public office to abandon all his private responsibilities ?If not, why distinguish between public and private business ? Might no privatebusinesses take up as much time as work for public companies, and did not privatebusinesses get into difficulties as often as public companies ? He thought that the sound plan was to leave the matter to the discretion of the individual Minister. Thiswas a commercial country. Was no man in business to take a part in the Governmentof the country ? Ministries came and went. You could not expect practical mento enter public life if it meant severing all connection with their old method of earning their livelihood. Futher, if the principle were adopted, it would have to beextended to all the members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Itwould certainly have to be extended to the front Opposition bench, who were analternative Ministry. Mr. Balfour admitted, of course, that no Minister ought tohold a directorship in the affairs of any company with which he might have to dealadministratively. He concluded by again reaffirming his opinion that the right course was to leave the matter to the judgment of the individual Minister, and that &quot;it isconfidence in the honour and discrection of the public men who are called to office inthis country, and not in any hard and fast illogical rule laid down by this House, thatthe credit and honour of public life in this country will for all time depend.&quot;The opposite case was urged by Mr. Sydney Buxton and Sir William Harcourt.Mr. Buxton thought there was great objection to Cabinet Ministers&apos; names appearing in large type prospectuses or advertisements. Such a Minister was either giving timeto private interests which he had better spend on public business, or was a mereguinea-pig. The distinction between the public company and the private business was that in the first the Minister was a trustee for shareholders, and in the secondonly for himself. In the first case, his duty as a trustee for the shareholders mightconflict with his duty as trustee for the public. There was only one sound rule, andthat was that directorships should not be held by members of the Government at all.If civil servants had to give their whole time, so ought Ministers. They were alsopublic servants and their emoluments were high. y\Sir William Harcourt thought that &quot; men who occupy official positions of greatresponsibility should devote themselves exclusively to that work and to no other.&quot;Was the holding of ministerial office to he held out as an inducement to investors ?The appearance of ministerial names on a prospectus either meant the diversion of
the Ministers time from public to private work, or the giving to the company of abogus credit through lending it the name of a man who, in fact, gave it no time.Further, there were cases where companies with which Ministers had had no morethan a formal connection, had got into trouble, and where the Minister had had to resign without being in any way to blame, but with great discredit to public life.On the 6th March, 1905, Mr. Swift MacNeill returned to the charge with aquestion. Mr. Balfour&apos;s reply was as follows : &quot; The only condition that ought toregulate a Minister of the Crown in regard to company directorship is thecommon-sense one that no Minister of the Crown ought to hold any office whichinterferes with the proper discharge of his duties as a Minister of the Crown.&quot;Throughout, the Government refused to publish any list of directorships held by ministers. Enquirers were referred to books of commercial reference, or to SomersetHouse, where the names could be ascertained on payment of a small fee.When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman came into office, he followed the principle which appears to have been laid down by Mr. Gladstone, and which was afterwardsadopted by the Liberal Party, requiring members of his Ministry to resign theirdirectorships. Sir Henry stated this principle, in reply to a question on the20th March, 1906, as follows : &quot; The condition which was laid down on the formationof the Government was that all directorships held by Ministers must be resigned,except in the case of honorary directorships, directorships in connection withphilanthropic undertakings, and directorships in private companies. Every member ofthe Government has either complied with this undertaking or is in process ofcomplying with it.&quot;On the 2nd April, 1906, in reply to a question from Mr. Bottomley asking uponwhat principles a member of the Government was precluded from being a director ofa public company, but was allowed to act as managing partner of a large private business, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman replied as follows: &quot; It has been found inpractice that it is inconvenient for members of the Government to hold directorshipsunless in exceptional circumstances, and no inconvenience has arisen from members ofthe Government being also concerned in the management of private businesses inwhich they are interested.&quot;On the 26th March, 1913, Mr. Swift MacNiel asked whether the Governmentwould introduce legislation making the practice inaugurated by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman obligatory on future Governments. Mr. Asquith replied: &quot;I think the rule is a good one, but I do not see my way to introduce legislation to make it binding on future Administrations.&quot;P H KMarch 24, 1917.o
