Mesopotamia :Possible Reductionof Shipping for.Italy.Invasion.Roumania.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thequestion was being considered of the possibility of reducing theamount of shipping required by the Mesopotamian ExpeditionaryForce, now that the force had reached an area from which supplies could be obtained and produced.2. With reference to War Cabinet 83, Minute 5, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff undertook to ascertain definitely, during his forthcoming visit to Italy, whether adequate arrangements hadbeen come to between General Xivelle and General Cadorna for the reinforcement of the Italian Army in the event of an enemy attackon that Front in such strength that the Italian Army could notwithstand it. He reported that at present his information on thesubject of these arrangements was contradictory.3. The Prime Minister read a letter which he had received from admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher of Kilverstone, expressing hisconsidered opinion, in view of the development by the enemy of submarines of great size and power, that the Germans were likelyto undertake an invasion of this countay, and urging that admiral sir John Jellicoe should again resume the command of the GrandFleet.The War Cabinet referred the question, in the first instance,for examination, in concert, by the Admiralty and GeneralStaff, who should press Lord Fisher to explain fully thegrounds on which his apprehensions were based.4. The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for War to instruct Mr. de Candolleand the other railway experts to proceed immediately to roumania (as a ship was sailing at once) without waiting for a definite decision by the Roumanian Government.Canada.5. With reference to War Cabinet 41, Minute 5, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that the Canadian Governmenthad decided that, owing to shortage of drafts, a fifth canadian division could not be sent to France unless we undertook not to usein front line more than four Canadian Divisions at the same time,and this we clearly could not do.The War Cabinet decided that The question of Canada providing more men should be raisedby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff at the forth-coming Imperial War Cabinets.Western Front.Beinforcements forthe British.6. In view of the above decision of the Canadian Government,the War Cabinet authorised The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to get another british division ready to go to the Western Front instead of theCanadian Division, its actual despatch to be settled later,after the investigation into the possibility of mvasion.&quot;GermanReinforcements.The german withdrawal.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the arrival of an additional German Division in Belgium.8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatdocuments had been captured on the Western Front indicating that
the Germans had decided on a gradual retreat to the Hindenburgline, to commence on the J 2th March, the actual date on which ithad commenced. *Salonica.9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatM. Venizelos had asked that the Cretan Division might be attachedto the British Expeditionary Force at Salonica, on the ground thatthe French had failed to supply sufficient hospital accommodation.The question had been examined in the War Office, and it had beenfound equally impossible for the British to provide the necessaryhospital accommodation unless a British division coxdd be withdrawn.On the one hand the War Cabinet recognise the objection toany increase in the size of the force at Salonica in the. existingtransport situation, and the difficulty of supplying the necessarymedical equipment, more particularly the doctors, of whom there isan existing shortage, of 800 on the requirements of the War Office..On the other hand they appreciate the political importance of taking the forces of the Greek Provisional Government under theBritish command, and generally of meeting the wishes ofM. Venizelos. Further, they appreciate the military importance ofthis access to the strength of the Allied Army at Salonica.The War Cabinet authorised-The Secretary of State for War to ascertain whether Greekdoctors could not be obtained, either from Greece itselfor from Egypt, Malta, Cyprus, and other places in theMediterranean, and to investigate the question whether, inthe event of doctors being obtainable, the War Office couldsupply the other medical requirements. They alsocommended to Lord Derby&apos;s consideration the possibility ofobtaining the services of these men for Labour Battalionsinstead of for military service.Russia.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read furthertelegrams in regard to the situation in Russia.China : Seizure ofGerman Shipping.11. The First Sea Lord reported the receipt of a telegram fromthe naval Commander-in--Chief, China, to the effect that the german merchant-ships at Shanghai had been seized by the Chineseauthorities without resistance. The Austrian merchant-ships hadnot yet been seized.Submarines.Torpedoing ofTransport&quot; Orsova.&quot;12. The First Sea Lord reported a number of engagements with enemy submai-ines, including one that indicated a successfulresult. He also reported the loss of British Submarine E..49, andthat the sunk British Submarine K. 13 (War Cabinet 52, Minute 2),had been raised.13. The First Sea Lord reported that the transport &quot; Orsova &quot;had been torpedoed and beached near Plymouth. It was hoped tobring her into port to-day.Mercantile losses in February and march Compared.14. The First Sea Lord gave a comparison of mercantile losses in the first thirteen days of February and March, respectively(Appendix I).Publication ofShipping Losses.15. With reference to War Cabinet 81, Minute 4, the First Lordconsulted the War Cabinet as to whether the aggregate tonnage ofthe ships sunk should be published with the weekly list, and stated
that a question had been asked in Parliament on the subject. Thearguments are balanced somewhat equally as follows:  .On the one hand, in favour of publishing the tonnage figures,first, there are the obvious advantages of candour as opposed toconcealment ; and, second, there is reason to believe that the british public have not yet realised the seriousness of the situation ; althoughagainst this it is represented that the public have shown themselvesquite prepared to accept any sacrifices imposed on them by theGovernment.On the other hand, the principal objections to publication are,first, that this information is a distinct encouragement to the enemy(against which, however, it is argued that the enemy alreadypublishes figures in exaggeration of the truth), and, second, that thepossibility that the losses might become so serious that we could not publish them without risk of panic.   The War Cabinet invited The First Lord to weigh these and other considerations, and toraise the question again on Monday next. In the mean-while, he should ask for the postponement of a parliamentary question which had been put on the subject.IDDardannelles 16. In view of the forthcoming debate in Parliament on theCommission. Report of the Dardanelles Commission, the War Cabinet decidedthat -Representatives of the Admiralty, War Office, and ForeignOffice, with the Secretary to the War Cabinet, should meet in the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ room at the House ofCommons, with a view to the preparation of sentencesreproducing the sense of the excised passages in theoriginal Report, without giving valuable information tothe enemy.Food.Meat.17. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby Professor Adams (Paper G.T.-155, Appendix II). It was pointedout that the amount of livestock at the present time in this countryis larger than at any other period in our history. The figures forthe weekly imports, as compared with the corresponding periods inrecent previous years, show that the position as regards meat stocksis also a strong one, though it was not clear whether the supplies for the Army were included in the figures submitted.Having regard to the connection between the maintenance of livestock and the tonnage required for feeding-stuffs, the WarCabinet were of opinion that there might be a case for a further reduction in the importations of meat. They therefore decidedthat The Food Controller should ascertain whether the stocks inthis country justify further restriction of the importationof meat, and whether the Army supplies were included inthe figures submitted.IncreasedCultivations.18. With reference to the Weekly Report of the FoodProduction Department of the Board of Agriculture for the weekending Tuesday, the 6th March, in regard to the work of the war agricultural Executive Committees, the Prime Minister drew attention to the great difference in the figures given for increasedcultivation in the different counties.Sir &quot;&quot;Arthur Lee explained that these differences were due to thefact that the figures were in the main estimates of an increased production that may vary according to the weather or the supply ofagricultural machinery.    The returns do not represent an actual
accomplishment. Some Committees are- prepared&apos; to record;optimistic estimates, while others do not like to commit themselvesto figures. Sir Arthur Lee pointed out that, while every pressure is brought to bear on these Executive Committees, e.g., by appeals from Headquarters and by visits from the Board&apos;s local Com-Qi missioners, there was no means of compelling them to increaseI the area under cultivation.Potatoes. 19. The War Cabinet had&apos; under consideration a report of aConference on the subject of Potato Supplies (Paper G-.T.-154:,Appendix III).Lord Devonport announced that he was about to inaugurate asystem of Potato Rations, which, while it could not be scientific inapplication, would do something towards making the present supplyof potatoes last until the time when the Jersey potatoes will beready, i.e., about the middle of May. The system of rations willbe carried out as regards eating-houses, clubs, hotels, &amp;c, by anOrder, and, as regards domestic consumption generally, by appeal.The War Cabinet decided that -The amount of the ration should be 6 oz. per head per day,with one potato-less day a week, or, in other words, 36 oz. aweek, and that this ration should apply to the Army athome as well as to the civilian population in this country,such adjustment being made in other items of the militaryration as may be necessary to replace the potatoes.20. The War Cabinet approved the recommendation of theConference on Potato Supplies, that the amount to be released by instalments for the benefit of Scotland should be 10,000 tons out ofa total of 29,000 tons at present under requisition by the Army inthe United Kingdom, the reason justifying such special treatmentbeing that Scotland has been denuded of seed potatoes for thebenefit of other parts of the country.21. The War Cabinet decided that : The present discussion should be resumed on Monday, the19th March, and, in the meantime, the Food Controllershould submit full proposals for circulation to members ofthe War Cabinet in regard to outstanding questions,including Meat, Milk, and Prices.22. The Chief Secretary for Ireland reported that there was apossibility of trouble in Ireland in connection with processions onSt. Patrick&apos;s Fay. On the other hand, the Police had no definite evidence of any intended seditious disturbance. The lord lieutenant was inclined to favour the prohibition of the pro-cessions. The Chief Secretary, however, and the Chief commissioner in Dublin thought on the whole that there should be no Proclama-tion forbidding the processions.The War Cabinet agreed with the Chief Secretary that theprocessions should not generally be prevented from takingplace, but that processions might be prohibited by thePolice locally in cases where they had evidence of seditiousintentions.Potatoes forScotland.Further discussion on Food Supplies.Ireland.

Figures are available which show the estimated number of weeks&apos;consumption in stock since the outbreak of the war. The average number of weeks&apos;stocks held in January, February, and March 1915, 1916, and 1917 are as follows:  ,Average Number of Weeks&apos; Supply of Wheat.--	- 1915.	1916.	1917.January February March  ..           . .	15 131 112	131 12 10f	131 10f 11These estimates allow for an increased milling percentage of wheat in accordance with the Food Controller^ orders.Oats. The stock of oats is low, having fallen from 9,023,000 quarters on the1st February to 5,742,000 on the 12th March.
Barley. The supplies available for food have , been greatly increased by theaddition of the supplies in the hands of the maltsters. The maltsters&apos; stocks were estimated, on the 10th February, at 1,890.000 quarters. It is calculated that about1,000,000 quarters might be held for a period of three months without deterioration,and the Food Controller has asked the Wheat Commission to consider a scheme withthe object of keeping this as a reserve, which will be available for breadmaking untilJune next.Maize. The supplies of maize havejsteadily improved during the past three weeks.(b.) Meat.The main source of meat supply is in the home herds and flocks.

The returns from over forty of the largest marketsshow that in the last six months of 1916 (i.e., after the annual census of livestock inJune) 289,135 fat stock were exposed for sale as against 297,917 the average1913-1915 and in the first ten weeks of 1917 the number of fat stock exposed forsale has been 118,522 as compared with 127,166 the average 1913-1915. There istherefore direct evidence that despite the fact that the herds of cattle are the higheston record, the slaughter of cattle has been under normal.As regards imports of meat, the following statement shows the imports of meat inthe first ten weeks of 1915, 1916, and 1917 and for the first quarter of 1913 : Weekly Imports in 1,000 cwt.Period.

Other Produce.Potatoes. The estimates as regards the stocks of potatoes available for food, after deducting seed, vary widely. Mr. Middleton, of the Food Production Department,estimates that the supply on the 1st March was from 280 to 300,000 tons. Mr. Dennis,the Potato Controller, considers, on the other hand, that the supply is not more than150,000 tons (120,000 tons, 30,000 for army canteens).Mr. Dennis puts the supply at equal to about three weeks of what he considers tobe the average consumption. The actual consumption per week is, however, verymuch less- owing to the present scarcity and price.Rice. The imports of rice in 1915 and 1916 have been large, viz., 9,993,039 cwt.in 1915, 8,659,722 cwt, in 1916, as compared with 5,417,619 cwt. in 1914.Stocks of rice in port granaries and millers&apos; hands in the United Kingdom on the1st January, 1st February, and 1st March, 1917, were as follows :-Owr.January  1    .. .. .. .. .. .. ..       1,820,000February 1   .. ....... . . .. . . &quot;       . . ..       2,240,000March     1   .. .. .. .. .. .. ..       1,880,00uSugar1.

At present theconfectionery, jam, biscuit, and mineral water trades are taking 6,200 tons per week being approximately 60 per cent, of their pre-war consumption.Dairy Produce.- Normally (1910-1914), the United Kingdom produces -25&quot;1 percent, of the supplies of butter and margarine, 19&apos;5 per cent, of its cheese, and 95*4 percent, of its milk supply. The only basis of evidence as to supplies is the number ofmilch cows. The number of milch cows show a small reduction in 1916, being4,034,382, as compared with 4,068,957 in 1915, and 4,144,937 in 1914.

Prices.The Board of Trade estimate that from July 1914 to March 1917 the increase inthe cost of all the items ordinarily entering into working-class family expendi tureincluding food, rent, clothing, fuel, and light, may be estimated at 65 per cent- Inother words, 20s. has only a purchasing power equal to 12s. in 1914. The rise in theprices of food has been considerably greater than the rise in the general cost of living.Up to the 1st February, 1917, the rise in the level of prices of food was returned bythe Board of Trade at 92 per cent. The price of the 4-lb. loaf has risen from b^d. inJuly 1914 to 8d. in July .1915, 9d. in July 1916, and lid. in March 1917. Thus in themost important article of consumption the rise has been exactly 100 per cent.ttAs regard imports, the following statement shows the imports 1913-1916Imports of Butter and Cheese in 1,000 cwt.

The Irish Department report that farmers are generallyendeavouring to carry out the scheme, but weather conditions have been bad, and thereis lack of machinery. A very considerable increase, however, in the tillage area isanticipated. In 1915, the first tillage year after the outbreak of war, the tillage areaincreased by 76,000 acres, largely as a result of the campaign, for increased foodproduction in 19.15. This increased area was substantially maintained in 1916, there being a slight falling off of 4,000 acres.An increase exceeding that of 1915 is now confidently expected.(Initialled) W. G. S.

APPENDIX ILLPotato Supply Conference.Held in the Chief Secretary&apos;s Room at the House of Commons, Monday, March 12, 1917.Present :The Chief Secretary.The Minister for Agriculture,The Secretary for Scotland.The Food Controller.In attendance :Mr. Middleton, Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. *Mr. Strutt, Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.Sir J. M. Dodds, Scottish Board of Agriculture.Captain Greig, Scottish Board of Agriculture.Mr. Grill, Department of Agriculture, Ireland.Mr. Campbell, Department of Agriculture, Ireland.Sir Henry Rew, Ministry of Food.Mr. Dennis, Ministry of Food.Mr. Adams, Prime Ministers Secretariat.Brigadier-General A. R. Crofton Atkins, C.B., Director of Supplies andTransport, War Office.Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon-Leith, Army Canteen Committee.Colonel H. G. Morgan, War Office.The Chief Secretary invited statements as to the potatoes available.The Secretary for Scotland stated that Scotland was destitute of potatoes, exceptfor a limited quantity of seed.Mr. Dennis estimated the potatoes at present available in England as about20 per cent, of a normal supply at this date, or about 120,000 tons, excluding thoseearmarked for the Army,Mr. Middleton stated that the normal supply for Great Britain on 1 st March was from 500,000 to 600,000 tons, and estimated that the available supply on 1st March ofthis year was 280,000 to 300,000 tons.Mr. Campbell stated that the only available supply in Ireland was that -in thenorth-eastern counties, where potatoes were grown for the market. About 50,000 tonsbeyond the requirements for local necessities could probably be obtained. Of these10,000 tons would be essential for the necessary food supply of the southern citiescustomarily provided from the north-eastern counties ; 30,000 tons would berequisitioned for the Army; 15,000 tons were heeded for the supplies which theDepartment of Agriculture had undertaken to provide for allotment tillage in Ireland.The Department had provisionally undertaken to secure 5,000 for the seed supplyrequirements of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, but that supply could only beobtained by means of diminutions in other demands.Colonel Morgan stated that the Army requirements to the end of June amountedto 36,000 tons for canteen consumption, of which 29,000 tons have been alreadyrequisitioned by the Canteen Committee ; and for Army rations for forces in the field33,000; tons, of which 30,000 tons would be requisitioned in the north-eastern counties of Ireland.The Chief Secretary invited discussion upon the question whether the difficulties caused by the undoubted shortage could be met by the vesting of all potatoes in a[1365-9/] E
Governmental authority and the control of the supply so as to secure*such economies inall directions as would safeguard tillage requirements- and Army requirements uponthe minimum essential scale and provide for distribution to the best public advantageof the residue of consumable potatoes.Mr. Dennis was of opinion that while requisitioning would be the ideal method ofsecuring and regulating the available supply, it would probably break down in practice -when the various questions of distribution which are involved would come to be faced.He also pointed out that it was now too late for any effective steps to be taken forrequisitioning the 1916 crop.Colonel Morgan was of opinion that the existing means of requisition under Armycontrol would be effective to secure the possession and subsequent regulateddistribution of all available potatoes.The Representatives of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries expressed greatconfidence that the necessary interferences with the movements of pototoes whichwould be involved in a general requisition of potatoes would be highly detrimental totillage, having regard to the stage which the agricultural operations of the year had reached. They thought the delay of even two or three weeks in potato planting wouldhave a very serious consequence upon the prospects of the potato&apos; crop.The balance of opinion in the Conference was on the whole definitely against thegeneral requisition of potatoes.The Chief Secretary next invited discussion upon the question whether a presentincrease of potato prices would probably be effective as a means.of bringing to marktsupplies of potatoes which at present are withheld.The Agricultural Experts were of opinion that the market shortage of potatoes isby no means entirely due to the holding up of supplies for increased prices ; and colonel Gordon Leith pointed out that the object ox a progressive scale of prices hadbeen to ensure diminished consumption at this time with a view to the necessities of later months.Mr. Middleton expressed the view that it would not be advantageous in thecommon interest to bring forward the general supply of ware potatoes at a rate whichwould lead to their very speedy consumption, but pointed out that the urgent presentnecessity was that of bringing forward the requisite supplies of seed potatoes.The general opinion of the Conference was adverse to a present increase in theprice of ware potatoes (i.e., potatoes for food).With regard to seed potatoes further discussion followed, and the opinion of theConference proved to be in favour of an increase of 21. per ton forthwith in the priceof seed potatoes as governed by the orders of the Food Controller. The effect of this increase would be that, until the 1st April, seed potatoes would be attracted by anincreased price to the full amount of 21. per ton, and from the 1st April to the15th April the present increase of 21. would have the effect of giving an increase of1Z. per ton beyond the price as now fixed by the Food Controller.The Conference agreed to recommend the increase of 21. per ton forthwith in the authorised price for seed potatoes.Mr. Middleton dissented.Mr. Campbell doubted.The Conference was of opinion that means should be found to accelerate purchaseof seed potatoes in Ireland.On behalf of the Irish Department of Agriculture it was stated that an increase of11. per ton for seed potatoes in Ulster, to be approved by the Food Controller, would nodoubt have the effect of bringing to market the necessary supplies. This course would,however, have some financial disadvantages, inasmuch as the Department has under-taken with local authorities to provide their seed potatoes for the Irish tillage schemeupon the footing of the present prices. It was estimated that the fulfilment of this undertaking upon the footing of a present increase in the price of seed potatoes in ulster would involve the Department in a pecuniary loss to the amount of,perhaps, 4,000?. ,The Representatives of the British Departments urgently advised that, if need be,this loss should be incurred in the common interest and with a view to. accelerate the
production of seed potatoes for tillage in the United Kingdom, and that the consequential loss should be, subject to the sanction of the Treasury, treated as an expense of the Irish tillage scheme for war purposes.The Food Controller agreed in the opinion that the proposed increase is necessaryin the public interest and that it should be made without delay, and notwithstanding*the apprehended and incidental loss.The proposed increase of 11. per ton for seed potatoes in Ulster was agreed to be advisable.(The attendance of the Chief Secretary in /the House of Commons was required atthis stage, and the Conference proceeded to discuss the question of whetherpotato supplies could he by any of the available agencies diverted to scotland in order to meet the shortage of potatoes for food in that country.)The Secretary for Scotland informs me that As regards the position in Scotland, the Conference was of opinion that theonly alternative to the fixing of a special higher price for the Scottish consumer (asolution which was understood to be ruled out, at least, for the moment) would heto restrict the potato ration on the basis of which supplies have been requisitionedfor the Army Canteen Committee for the use of the Army in the United Kingdom.The present rate of consumption for that purpose was stated as amounting to2,300 tons per week. Colonel Gordon Leith objected to any such restriction.He also stated that Lord Derby was advised that his powers do not extend torequisitioning for the Army and releasing part of the requisitioned stock for civilian use. On behalf of the Food Controller, on the other hand, it wassuggested that, if such stocks were released and then requisitioned for scotland by the Food Controller, any legal difficulty might be got over.It was considered reasonable that any shortage of potatoes affecting the civilian population should he shared by the Army in the United Kingdom, whose requisitioninghas been on the basis of a normal general supply, and it was recommended that theamount to he released by instalments for the benefit of Scotland should he 10,000 tons,out of a total of 29,000 tons at present under requisition, the reason justifying suchspecial treatment being that Scotland has been denuded of seed potatoes (which inpresent circumstances means practically all potatoes grown in Scotland) for the benefitof other parts of the country.The Army representatives intimated their dissent, and requested that the matter should be referred for the decision of the War Cabinet?i(Initialled) H.
