Swinton, C.B., D.S.O., Assistant Secretary.The Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military  Operations reported   that theBritish troops had captured about 2,000 yards of the HindenburgLine, and that their casualties in the previous twenty-four hours hadbeen only 1,700. Since .the 9th April, the total British casualties had been considerably less than the total reached during the SommeBattle. He undertook to obtain the exact figures of the losses sincethe 9th April.Ammunition. 2. The Director of Military Operations gave the comparativefigures for the artillery, ammunition, in preparing for their attacks,expended by the British and French respectively. Of field gun ammunition the British had fired about the same number of rounds.as the French ; from medium guns the British had fired twice theamount of ammunition as the French ; and from the heavy guns theBritish had fired five times as much as the French, the exact figures in the latter case being 63 rounds per gun as compared with11 &quot;7 rounds per gun. In General Maurice&apos;s opinion, these figuresshowed that the French had not made sufficient use of their heavy artillery, which might have been one of the causes for the fact thatthey had not succeeded better.^ Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1917.SECRET.
The Italian Front.Coal for Italy.3. The Director of Military Operations stated that the news from Italy was good, the Italians having captured over 7,000prisoners. Though they had once or twice reached the summit ofMonte Santo, they had not got complete possession of that summit,which they required to complete the capture of the Monte Kukposition. Once that was done their operations would be further developed. He stated that the question^ of the heavy artilleryammunition for &quot;the Italian Army was -causing great anxiety toGeneral Cadorna, who was sending General Porro to Pome to go into the subject at a Conference of Ministers.It was pointed out that the supply of shells for the Italianheavy artillery depended entirely on the supply of coal and steel,and some discussion took place as to the possibility of sending coal to Italy overland through France,.instead of by sea, owing to theshortage of shipping.Admiral Jellicoe stated that the French were also makingurg-ent demands for coal, of which there seemed to be a chance thattheir Fleet might go short. He pointed out that the ShippingController had recently transferred ten ships from Archangel forthe purpose of carrying coal to Italy.The War Cabinet decided that Lord Robert Cecil should confer with the Departments con-cerned, in order to devise some arrangement by which more coal could be sent to Italy.The CretanDivision.4. In reference to the previous decision of the War Cabinet onthe subject of the Cretan Division (War Cabinet 132, Minute 8),the Director of Military Operations said that Lord Granville had telegraphed to the effect that M. Yenizelos was still very anxious that the Cretan Division, which had been disembarked at Salonica,should be incorporated with the British force and be under theorders of General Milne. He explained that the Chief of. theImperial General Staff had no objection to this course, but consideredthat the French should first be consulted.The War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should tele-graph to the French Government to the effect thatM. Venizelos had requested that the Cretan Division shouldbe placed under the orders of the British Commander at salonica, and that the British Government were willing tomeet his views if the French Government concurred in thiscourse.Shipping Losses:British and Allied.5. The First Sea Lord gave a summary of losses owing to theaction of enemy submarines during the previous five days. he reported that, out of twenty-three vessels which had been damaged by torpedoes and beached since the 1st January, nineteen had beensalved or were salvable, and four were total losses.Naval Action in 6. The First Sea Lord read out the Italian official account ofthe Adriatic. the recent naval action in the Adriatic, and stated that he hadreceived the congratulations of the Italian Minister of Marine and naval Commander-in-Chief on the part played by H.M.S. &quot;Dart-mouth.&quot;T.B.D. &quot; Setter.&quot; 7. The First Sea Lord reported that on the night of the 17/18th %)May whilst on convoy duty with Dutch ships the destroyer &quot; Sylph &quot;had collided with the destroyer &quot; Setter &quot; in thick weather and had sunk her.   All hands had been saved.
Submarine S. The First Sea Lord reported a number of actions with enemy submarines, in three of which it seemed probable that the submarineshad been sunk. He also reported an attack by the British seaplaneNo.^ 8663 on a German submarine off Lowestoft, in which it was probable that the submarine had been destroyed.&quot;Nugent&quot; 9. The First Sea Lord reported that the destroyers &quot; Nugent &quot;au&quot; . and &quot; Myngs&quot; had been in collision, and had both been damaged.Enemy Destroyer 10. The First Sea Lord reported that British aircraft fromBombed. Dunkirk had dropped several bombs on a German destroyer offZeebrugge.Mine-Laying. 11. The First Sea Lord also reported that during the previousthree days three mine-laying expeditions into the Heligoland Bighthad been successfully carried out.Bombardment of turkish coast defences.- 12. The First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Raglan &quot; andsome small monitors had bombarded the land defences on CapeHelles, and had destroyed some 8-inch gun emplacements.Norway. 13. The First Lord of the  Admiralty drew attention to atelegram from the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, reporting thesuspicious movements of a German merchant vessel, the &quot; HeinrichBlum berg,&quot; inside the Holmengraa Fjord, indicating a probability that the vessel was attempting to obtain information about thesailing of convoys. He stated that the Commander-in-Chief, GrandFleet, had pointed out before the great difficulty of stopping Germanraiders, caused by the fact that the Germans were in the habit of entering- Norwegian territorial waters.During&apos; the discussion it was stated that the Norwegians wouldbe much upset if the British navy took action against hostile vesselswithin territorial waters; but that, on the other hand, there now seemed a possibility of getting Norway in on our side. To thiscourse the Admiralty were now, on the whole, favourable; while theobjections to it, which had been put forward by the War Office, hadbeen due mainly to the possibility of hostile action by Swedenagainst Norway, of which the risk, however, had decreased verymuch.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should keep undercareful observation the possibility of bringing in Norway onthe side of the Allies.Serbia. 14. The First Lord of the Admiralty read a telegram receivedfrom Rear-Admiral Troubridge, in which the latter stated that the prince Regent of Serbia had expressed a desire that AdmiralTroubridge should proceed to England to give a verbal explanationto the British Government as to the position of the Serbian Army,the Prince Regent being of opinion that, unless matters could be improved, there would probably be a collapse on the part of Serbia.The War Cabinet authorised The Admiralty to recall Admiral Troubridge so that he mightreport on the state of affairs in Serbia.
15. The War Cabinet again considered the question of - sendingBritish representatives to attend the Socialist Conference at stockholm.Lord Robert Cecil reported that Messrs. Thome, 0&apos;Grady, andSanders, the delegates who had been sent to represent the LabourParty at Petrograd, had been asked by the Foreign Office to suspend -their return journey at Bergen, in order that they might beavailable, if desired, to proceed to the Socialist Conference at stockholm. He asked for immediate instructions from the WarCabinet as to whether they should remain in Scandinavia for thepresent or not. Lord Robert Cecil pointed out the danger of allowing the Conference at Stockholm to take place without thepresence of any British representatives, either to watch theproceedings, or to combat the influence of the German Socialists,and in this connection he quoted the British Minister at Stockholm(telegram No. 1551, dated the 20th May). He urged that astrong deputation of the British Labour Party, headed perhaps byMr. Arthur Henderson himself, should be sent to Stockholm. he also suggested that Mr. Henderson might with advantage be sent ona Special Mission to Petrograd, corresponding to that of M. AlbertThomas.Mr. Henderson pointed out the difficulty of now sending british representatives to attend the Stockholm Conference. In accordancewith the views of the War Cabinet, he had used his influence withthe Executive Committee of the Labour Party not to take part inthe Stockholm Conference, and a decision in this sense had beenreached on the 11th May. Instead, he had suggested that aConference of Allies should be held in London. This idea, however,was at present in abeyance pending the receipt of definite informationas to a proposal by the Russian Socialists to hold a Conference insome neutral country. Only this morning, however, he had receivedenquiries from M. Thomas as to the proposed London. Conference.In the course of the discussion it transpired that the Conferencenow taking place at Stockholm consists merely of separate andsuccessive conversations between the Dutch-Scandinavian SocialistCommittee and representatives of the Socialist parties of the variousbelligerent nations. M. Vandervelde, the Belgian Socialist, hasalready taken part in such a conversation (Stockholm telegramNo. 1492, dated the 15th May), and the arrival of Russian andGerman delegations at Stockholm is expected in the near future.The War Cabinet were also informed that Messrs. Macdonaldand Jowett, of the Independent Labour party, and Mr. Inkpin, ofthe British Socialist party, have applied for passports for Petrograd,presumably with the intention of stopping at Stockholm en route.Whether these separate Conferences are eventually to befollowed by a formal Conference to be attended by the socialist parties of the various nations is not at present clear, and willprobably depend on the results of these preliminary conversations.It was generally agreed that if a Conference should take place,British representatives should attend. Otherwise the Russian andGerman Socialists would fraternise without any counteractinginfluence, probably with the worst results to the cause of the Allies,and a wholly false impression as to war-weariness among the Alliesmight be given to the enemy by the French Minority Socialists, andby written communications smuggled out of this country. It was.realised, also, that a British refusal to participate would have a veryserious effect in Russia and would strengthen the German anti-British propaganda in that country.It was also agreed that Mr. Henderson, even though proceeding to- the Conference as a representative of the British Labour party,might, as a member of the British War Cabinet, be placed in a verydifficult position.There was some discussion as to whether Mr. ramsay macdonald should be encouraged to attend the Conference.    On
the one hand, it was urged that he could probably be counted on totake up a sound line in regard to annexations and. indemnities, andthat, owing to his well-known views in regard to the war, hisopinions would carry weight, and might strengthen the democraticmovement in enemy countries. On the other hand, it was realised that Mr. Macdonalcl&apos;s inclusion among the representatives of BritishSocialist parties would involve the presence of other members of theIndependent Labour Party who could not be trusted to maintain a correct attitude. Although no decision wras taken on this point, itwras generally agreed that Mr. Ramsay Macdonald should not beallowed to go unless accompanied by a strong delegation of theBritish Labour Paiiw.The &quot;War Cabinet decided that (a.) The three British representatives from Petrograd now atBergen should no longer be detained there.(6.) With a view to a decision on the larger question, the acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should draft a telegram to M. Thomas, in Petrograd, explaining that the War Cabinet considered it dangerous for theRussian and German Socialists to meet without british representatives being present to put forward the Britishcase, and asking him for his views on the subject : thedraft to be submitted to the Prime Minister for hisconcurrence.Ireland.Statements inParliament.16. The War Cabinet had before them replies from Mr. Redmond(Paper G.T.-743), Sir John Lonsdale (Paper G.T.-743a), Mr. William0&apos;Brien (Paper G.T.-743b), and Lord Midleton (Paper G.T.-772),to the Prime Ministers letter of the 16th May on the subject of theGovernments proposals in regard to Ireland (War Cabinet 140,Appendix). The general character of the statements to be made inthe afternoon by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, andby Lord Curzon in the House of Lords, was considered by the WarCabinet. After discussion, the Prime Ministers draft was generally &apos;approved, subject to some amendments. This led to a preliminary discussion on various questions connected with the proposed IrishConvention.The Composition ofthe Convention.17. The War Cabinet had before them a rough proposal for the composition of the Irish Convention, which had been handed to thePrime Minister by Mr. Redmond (Appendix). It was generally agreed that the size of the Convention proposed by Mr. Redmond,namely, 171 members, was too large for the effective transaction ofbusiness. In this connection, attention was called to the followingprecedents of national Conventions summons for the formation ofConstitutions : United States of America Convention, composed of 55 members.Canadian Convention, composed of 33 members.Australian Convention, composed of 60 members.South African Convention, composed of 34 members.It was pointed out, however, that a large Convention, such as was proposed by Mr. Redmond, would be able to delegate the actualdrafting of the Irish Constitution to a committee elected from itsown members, and that this would avoid the difficulty of obtaining a representative Convention composed of a smaller number ofmembers. It wras generally felt that, as the object of the proposed convention is to invite Irishmen to try and settle their constitutional difficulties for themselves, its procedure should, as far as possible,be left for the decision of its members.[1365-141] C
The War Cabinet decided that- j$)The Chief Secretary for Ireland should sound the Leaders ofthe various Irish Parties on their views as to the numbers and composition of the Convention.The Chairman of - 18. There was a short preliminary discussion as to who shouldthe Convention. . be the Chairman of the Convention. It was generally agreed thatthe Chairman should be nominated by the Government, and not leftto election by the Convention, but no decision &quot;was taken pendingthe result of Mr. Duke&apos;s enquiries.Secrecy of the 19. It was generally agreed that the Convention should sit withProceedings. closed doors, and that its proceedings should be entirely secret.There was some discussion as to whether even the publication in thepress of rumours relating to the Convention should not be prohibited,but no decision was taken on this point.Proposed Nitro-Cellulose PowderFactory atHenbury.20. The War Cabinet authorised The Minister of Munitions to publish a statement that thedecision not to proceed with the proposed nitro-cellulosepowder factory at Henbury was taken by the War cabinet after full examination of all the circumstances.
