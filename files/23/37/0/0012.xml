MOTOR OARS (l)   The attention of the Conference was drawn, as AIN IRELAHDquestion of urgency, to objections raised &quot;by the labour Partyto an Order issued by the IrishGovernment for restricting the use of motor oars     in Ireland. The object of this order was to prevent the use of by Sinn Feiners oi motor cars forraids.The Conference agreed  That tho Order could not be revoked, but thePrime Minister stated that if tho Labour Partyagreed to take the responsibility for raising the question, ho would not refuse to receive a Deputation.MEAT (2) With reference to War Cabinet 635, Minute 6, the Con-SUPPLIES.ference had before thorn a Memorandum by the Pood Controller(Paper CP. -.146)  on the financial effects of the trans-actions of the Ministry of Pood.The Conference proceeded to consider the acute conges-tion of meat supplies owing to the heavy-importation of fro-sen meat from Australiai It was estimated that up to June of next year there would be 75,000 tons a month of imported meat for disposal,  of which tho Army and Havy wouldconsume 10,000tons, leaving 65,000 tons for distribution. All cold storagewas occupied.    It was suggested,  on the one hand, that thoonly way of clearing the accumulation was to restore complete freedom of sale by putting an end to control, including there-in the system of compelling purchasers.to buy only at the par-ticular butcher with whom they were registered. It was pointedout, on the other hand, that the Ministry of Pood were com-mitted to the farmers to take home-grown meat at a guaranteed price, and that if large quantities of imported meat ?;ere re-leased the Government would incur a liability to the farmersamounting to several millions in fulfilment of the guarantee.On the other hand, it was suggested that the Government had only committed themselves to take from farmers at a (guaranteed price as much meat as was required for consumption.   against this it was urged that it would be impossible to ask the-1-
 farmers to submit to de-control at the present time after they had made their arrangements for season, if at the same time the market was to be broken by a flood of imported meat. It was pointed out, however, that the present consumption of meat was down to 25,000 tone a week as compared with a normal pre-war consumption of 30,000, and that if consumption were increased by 5,000 tons a week it would help to relieve the congestion. Objection was raised to the complete removal of restrictions and the stimulation of consumption to the pre-war rate, on the ground, that if the present accumulations were disposed of there would be a very serious world shortage in the following autumn, and it was considered that the crux of the problem was in fact a deficiency of cold storage, which it was impossible to build in time to prevent the meat from going bad.

It was stated that the Board of Agriculture should be able to approach the farmers with a suggestion, by ray? of compromise, that they should agree to de-control subject to the total amount of imported meat released not being more than the pre-war normal consumption of 16,000 tons a week. It was suggested that farmers would not be likely to entertain this figure. Some discussion took place as to the applicability of this figure to current conditions of diminished consumption, but it was generally felt that if the farmers could agree to the release of 16,000 tons a week, or roughly 65,000 tons a calendar month, the problem of the accumulations would be solved.

The Conference decided -

That the President of the Board of Trade should confer, at 3 p.m. on the following day, with the President of the Board of Agriculture and representatives of the Ministry of Food, and endeavour to arrive at a solution on the lines of the above discussion.



PARLIAMENTARY GRANTS TO OFFICERS.

(3) The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the opinion of the Treasury Solicitor had been received on a question which had been referred to him by the Finance
Committee.-,-., whether the officers in the navy and Army towhom sums of money had been granted by Parliament for theirdistinguished services in the :&apos;.&apos;ar were entitled to object tothe mone.3r being tied up- in&apos;strict settlement for the benefitof their children,-.and were able to : demand payment of a capital sum free from restrictions.    The.Treasury Solicitor^as. of opinion that the recipients of the money granted byParliament had no legal right to enforce payment either-against the Crown or: against the Treasury, and it was there-fore open to the Crown to aslc that the sums an cpiestionshould be made the subject of strict settlement on the ohild-ren of the beneficiaries.    It was- explained that the operative part of the Resolution in the House of Commons wasthe grant of a lump sum to the King,   and that while- the termsof the Resolution named officers individually, it was merelyan empowering Resolution and did not&apos; confer any rights.The Conference agreecThat His Majesty&apos;s Government must insist&apos;onthe sums granted,being tied up in strictsettlement for the benefit of- the recipients&apos;children.Whitehall Gardens, S.Y/.1,Hovember 28, 1919..     -..
