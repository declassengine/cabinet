I     (1) With reference to War Cabinet 209, Minute 1 (f)theConferz-ence had under consideration a Memorandum by aho Mln-istor of Munitions (Paper C.P.-138) regarding the agreement which had been entered into with tho Applgby Iron Company InSeptember, 1917,It was generally agreed that, while on,the face of it theGovernment could not legally refuse to pay the. claims of the Com-pany, they had every moral right to evade fulfilling the contractif possible, as such fulfilment would amount to the payment of 2,500,000 to the Company in return of nothing.   Doubts were expressed as to whether the legal position had been sufficientlyexplored, and it was suggested that further examination of the contract by the Law Officers was desirable.The Conference decideds-That the Law Officers should be asked to considerafresh the whole question of the contract with theAppleby Iron Company, and to advise whether, in theiropinion, it was so drawn that nothing short of the terms proposed by the Minister of Munitions was possible.    Inparticular the Law Officers should be Invited to eon-eider whether the Minister of Munitions was bound to award anything under the terms of paragraph 3 of theletter of September 21st, 1917, from the Ministry ofMunitions to the Appleby Iron Company, if he thoughtthat the Company was otherwise sufficiently rewardedor compensated.(2) The Conference had under consideration a Joint Memoran-dum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Financial Secre-tary to the Treasury (Paper F.C.-25) regarding Financial Reso-resolutions to Bills.It was explained that it was difficult, now that manyBills were discussed In a Standing Committee of the House ofCommons and not, as formerly, in a Committee of the whole House,for the Government of the day to.provide against the insertion ir.a Bill of -amendments involving increased expenditure if theFinancial Resolution under consideration was wide enough to permisuch amendments.The Conference decided:-(i)  That in future all Financial Resolutions, like allEstimates, should be placed on the Paper in the name ofthe Financial Secrc i.: &quot; - to- trie Treasury, and that forthis purpose Dep;...- should be required to submit&quot;i- the
IcrrRIBUTIONI WAR MEDALS.[ISCHARGEf CIVILIANSUBORDINATESf THE ROYALIR FORCE.the terms of their Resolutions to the Treasury forthe approval of the Financial Secretary before they are placed on the Papert(ii) That the Secretary to the Cabinet should communicate the above decision to all government Departments.(3) With reference to War Cabinet 593, Minute- 1, regardingthe distribution of the British War Medal, the Lord privy seal stated that he had received a letter from Sir FrederickPonsonby referring to the divergence in procedure betweenthe Navy and the Army in the grant of the Medal.Some discussion ensued on the difficulties of uniform-ity of practice in the case of the Navy and the Army, and itappeared that, so far as the Army were consumed, dlstribu-tion of the British War Medal to soldiers isho had servedabroad would not be completed before the expiration of fouryears.    So far as the War Office was concerned, therefore,the question of extending distribution to those men who hadnot served abroad did not arise as an immediate issue.The Conference decided:-(i) That the question of the distribution ofthe British War Medal to the Army shouldbe kept distinct from that of its distri-bution to the Royal Navy:(li) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should go into the matter and see if it were notpossible to restrict the distribution ofthe Medalj(iii) That the practise of the Royal Air force should folio?/ that of the Army, exceptfor minor differences in such cases asthose of airmen who had ascended to attackenemy aircraft raiding this country, but who had not actually gone abroad for service.(4) The Conference had under consideration the following documents on the question of the discharge of civiliansubordinates of the Royal Air force (a) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air- (Paper CP.-141) ,A Minute from the Chancellor of the exchequer to the Secretary of State for Air(Paper CP.-169) .The Secretary of State for Air stated that he had
suggested the action outlined in his Memorandum of November 17th, because he was under the impression that the cabinet had decided that, when the Out-of-work Donation ceased,there would be a slowing down  of discharges from Government employment. At the moment, the civilian subordinates em? 1? Air Force Depots were giving a great deal ? were appealing to the Prime Minister, who had ? it Woolwich on Friday next. He thought that ? ?an employees were discharged, the result would? of agitation and trouble. As a set-off to?  at Royal Air Force Depots, a scheme had been ? release  of unfit ex-service men. This ? ?ted, would result in a reduction of at least ?  ?ra cost incurred by the modification of the ? ?ted in his Memorandum. (paper C.P -141). ?tention of these men was desirable in itself ?dite the disposal of stores.

?ointed out that the scheme for slowing down the Dockyards (Cabinet 4 (19), Conclusion 1: ?ent from the proposals of the Secretary of ? that it was a very special remedy for an ? applied only to places such as the great ? ?here were large and simultaneous ?he Navy, the Army and from other Government ? here no alternative employment existed. ?o conditional on men in Naval Dockyards ?  short? time and take less pay. As a matter ? had been-rejected by a majority of the ?ion would have to come before the Cabinet

?rence decided :-

? discharges of civilian subordinates ?re due to be carried out at Royal ?e Depots should be suspended for ?nt: 

? question of continuing such dis? ? in accordance with the standing pro? ?ould be settled by discussion between


&quot;the Chancellor of tho exchequer and thevf -Secretary of State for Air, after thequestion of the Dockyard discharges- hadBeen&quot;decided by the Cabinet and the PrimeMinister had paid his visit to Y/oolwich;.(iii) That the, Secretary of - State for Air should as far. as possible^ expedite? the dischargeof military employees at Royal * Ir ForceDepots/ with a.vi&apos;*w to .substitutung as--permanent employees the civilians subordin-ates- referred to in his Memorandums :[ROUTE      (5)      With reference to War Cabinet 629 Minute S the Confer--I EGYPTINDIA       ence had before re them a Memorandum! by the- Secretary of Statefor Air (Paper CP.

On the other hand, it    fas pointed oiat that all theSecretsy of State for Air desired was authority to make- a survey *The Conference agreedTdhat it was desirable: that the matter should-be settled, is possible, and requested theSecretary of State for Air to confer with- theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and take such actiom as might be agreed on between)them.OSED       i&amp;)     The Conference had under-consideration! a Memorandum by&apos; OFJRAFT TO the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper CP* -1.7-9)iMDregarding the gift of aircraft to Poland.   It appeared thatthe offer which had been- made to the Polish Government ofcertain aeroplanes was contrary to the decisions of the Y/war cabinet  taken on October 16 and October 20, 1919 (War Cab-r nett 631, Minute 4\ and War Cabinet 633, Minute 6:),  which stated that the stores to be given to Poland should be limited to
non-marketable Munitions, and tbat any -assistan.ee-from theWar Office    should form a contribution &apos;to an allied effort and not be an independent contribution.    -$Moreover;, negotiations were how on the point of conclusion between the Llnistry of Munitions and a group of buyers for the sale of allaeroplanes and their engines which had been or would be declared surplus^The Conference decided -fi) That it would be undesirable; to withdraw theoffer made, to the Palish Government-offer(ii) That the Minister of Munitions should ascer-talr whether he could complete th** negotiationsraierrred to above, with the omission of theaeroplanes mentioned in the foreign office memorandum (Paper C.pa179)8 andthat. ifthis were not possible, he should refer thematter to the Cabinet.2, white hall Gardens, S.W.1.November 25, 1919*
