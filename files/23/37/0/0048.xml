Storr, C.B., Assistant Secretary.The Prime Minister said that he had hurriedly-summoneda Conference of his colleagues as he had just received a communication from M. Karaeneff which contained the terms of theArmistice and the preliminaries for peace which would be sub-mitted at Minsk by the Russian Delegates.    In making this communication M. Kameneff made the reservation that these termsmight be supplemented by details of secondary moment.    (ThePrime Minister then read oxxt to the Conference the communication from M. Earaeneff, Appendix In)
The Prime Ministor,  confirming * said that &quot;the-&apos;&quot;terms.-&quot;were not nearly so severe as had been imposed by theAllies upon -Germany and Austria, and he did not think thatGreat Britain could make war in order to secure betterconditions than these,      There were two things which required decision.      First,, was this communication to he submitted to France, with or wi tho tit an expression ofopinion by His Majesty&apos;s Governments    If it was decidedto transmit it,what comment should the British Governmentmake?     Second, should! it be sent to Poland, and,if so,- should the Government state their opinion of the terms?The Leader of the House had another difficulty to put to the Conference; hut this might be discussed laterj itwas that MrAsquith and Mr-Clynes had both pressed (a) thatthe League of Nations should be asked to decide the termsof Peace between Soviet Russia and Poland,and (b) that theCabinet should come to no final decision without consultingParliament again.If the terms were communicated to Paris there wasthe danger   that they would he negatived by the FrenchGovernment-:    The French almost invariably adopted the negative attitude in the first instance.    Their Representa-. tives had come to the Lynpne Conference with the idea, afasking the British Delegates to agree t-s the publicationof a proclamation of a most violent and impossible character.France was passionately anti-holshevist, as the French^had had experience of communism,    The present case had, however,nothing to do   -ith communism.It was generally agreed, however,,that it was impossible tocommunicate the terms to Poland without submitting themfirst or simultaneously to the French Government     The french were apprehensive that the terms might Include the establish-ment of a Soviet Government In Poland with Marshal Pilsudskiat the head of it, and they would undoubtedly be.relieved
to find that the present corrrronic-ation contained, no suchconditions,As regards tho terms themselves it was generally agreed that they were as reasonable as could he expected,but that certain items, viz, the future strength of the.Polish Army and the final frontiers might require further examination.    A great cause of satisfaction was that theconditions secured the independence of Poland and - assuming the bona-fides of the Soviet Governmentand its delegatesit was feltjin London - the British Government could not,/without aserious breach of faith, now proceed with the hostile measurescontemplated at the Lympne Conference, in the event of affairetaking a sinister turn.On the other hand it was strongly urged that it was essential for the Allies to contemplate the possibility of bad faith on the part of tho Soviets,and attention was drawn to the condition which laid down that all arms over and above such as may be required for  the needs of the reducedArmy, as well as of the Civic !IIlitiaA shall be handed overto Soviet Russia and the Ukraine,and it was suggested thatthis might mean that the arms     were required for a Red Armyin Poland,After a further short discussion, it was decidodt-(o)    That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should, draft a telegram to tho British Ministerat Warsaw, giving him the text of the Soviet terms and instructing him to communicate them immediately to the Polish Government, with the comment that&apos; His &quot;ajosty&apos;s Government are of opinion that pro-vided thjS.se terns are bans-fide offered at Minskand that/substantial addition Is made to them, theywould appear to leave the independence of Poland.:within her ethnographic frontiers unimpaired&quot;,    theBritish Government could not aseutaws responsibilityof taking hostile action agai..t.t itussia if theconditions now offeree in their general substancewere refused; although the Poles were, of course,at liberty to secure by negotiation better termsif they could.
(V)     The Secretary 6? State for Foreign affairs should similarly communicate the terms to theFrench Government through the British ambassador in Paris, stating that the document had been.telegraphed to Warsaw and that  the british minister at that capital had boon instructedin the sense of (c) above;  that the Cabinet,after the Debate in the House of Commons that day, were unanimous in thinking that publicopinion in Parliament and in the country wouldnot justify the British Government in undertakinghostilities against Russia in order to securebetter terms;  and expressing the hope that theFrench Government would bo disposed to givesimilar instructions to their Minister atY/warsaw.
The.  ?rime- M.i..n,i,si^e. &quot;said that the&quot;hiaxt-mert1^jr.-wn flhieb&apos; -he desired to consult his oollaagues was this.    Two ques-tions had been raised by the leader of th6 Liberal party and by Mr. clynes, on behalf of the Labour party, in the debate in the House of Commons that afternoon.The first of these questions requirou an immediateanswer.   Mr. Asquith had urged that, from the point ofma still mere so from th-.t ef tho H -use -.f C.mm-ns,viow of the Government / when the present negotiationsterminated, Parliament should have sn opportunity of re-viewing the situation before any warlike stops were taken.The other suggestion of Mr. Asquith was that the wholequestion ought to bo referred to an impartial and repre-sentative Tribunal and that if the pre..ant negotiationsbroke down, the machinery of the League of Nations ohoullbe brought in to deal with the Situation.     The firstsuggestion required an answer that evening. . The secondcould be deferred until the following day.   Mr. Lloyd Georgesaid that he himself was afraid of the very serious effectif, owing to the strength of labour opposition as supportedby Mr. Asquith, he had to summon Parliament again. -   TheBolsheviks would be certain to make capital out of it andhe himself was opposed to giving any such undertaking, atany rate that night. .It was pointed out, on the other hand, that Labourwas in a very irritable farame of mind at- present, and that pressure outside Parliament might compel the Governmentto give some such undertaking as Mr. Asquith had suggested.The suggestion, indeed, had been made in such a way as toplace the Jover.jr.ent in a false position.    It made it appear as if the Government asked to be the sole judv.esof the question, and to bo empowered to act arbitrarily...and
and thus to impair -the -a-irthorlty of Pariiat^nt.   ThiA^v%vttwould-^oertainly be shared by a eensiderabla numberof the Government supporters t and a new ory would be r&amp;^edthat the House of Commons was not only tame, but-that itwas flouted and ignored.       The Government would probablybe in a stronger position if a reply were given in the sense that while they hoped that there would be no break-down in the negotiations, yet If this unfortunately shouldoccur, the House would at once be summoned.Phe view was expressed that it might be as well to challenge a division and take advantage of a favourablevote in the House that evening - although that vote couldnot be unanimous - in order to secure general approvalof the Government policy.    There was no doubt that the atmosphere in and outside Parliament was dead against a newwar, and people were greatly afraid of being dragged intofresh hostilities of any kind.     It was most Important thatthe Government should, carry Parliament with them, and thatthey should not play into the hands of agitators.    It was difficult for the Government to ask for a blank cheque, andto refuse to give the undertaking sought by Mr. Asquithmight create a bad impression;    such a refusal mightstimulate opposition in the country and increase thedifficulties that were to be anticipated at Minsk.    Itwas suggested that while the Government might be perfectlyjustified in retaining their right to persevere in theirwarlike preparations in anticipation of the worst,they were not justified in going beyond those preparationswithout consulting Parliament.It was generally felt that the reply to Mr. Asquithmight be somewhat on the following lines   -,TThe Debate to-day in the House shows that if the contingency arises that Polish independence is... threatened
threatened; the GonrernEierrt have the support of theHouse.    The Government could not undertake totake no action, whatever emergency might arise.It was quite     possible, that, in the event of abutcrisis, immediate action might be necessary,/inat rnce summoned andthat    jase the House would be/asked later to accord its approval.&quot;It was decidedThat the Prime Minister or the leader of theHouse should that evening reply to the effectthat he hoped that the Government would notbe pressed that night to give the undertakingasked for by the leaders of the Opposition.If the Opposition were still of the same opinion on Thursday, they might put the same question again.2 Whitehall Gardens, S..W.1.11th August, 1920,

Kameneff presents his compliments to the night Hon.Mr. Lloyd ^eorge,  and begs to communicate to him the terms ofthe armistice and preliminaries for peace which will be submittedat Minsk by the Russian delegates,    M.
