i C H B %ITIOU 1*     The Confe rence- haisunder- cdnsid.sra-tion a^MemotrandnmS, hy^the &quot;&quot;Minister of Transport (G.P&amp;1595) relative to theposition of controlled canals not owned hy RailwayCompanies, from which it appeared that during- the Warpossession had been taken ef these canals under the- &quot;provisions of the Defence of the Realm Acts.    Thisemergency power of possession and the existing financiatlguarantee by the State lapses on the 31st August next,and it is proposed that the Defence of the Realm JtegulatlitosTOrder respeoting them should he re voice     and the present arrangements terminated as from that date.    In order toprovide against the- possibility of these canals becomingdereliot during the period that must elapse before theGovernment policy in regard to their future is formulated,it was proposed that the Minister of Transport should takepossession of canals under the Ministry of Transport Act,-with a view to authorising an Increase of tolls and charges^.and also that.the State should be: prepared to render finan--cial assistance to the canals until a definite policyrespecting them is adopted,The Conference also had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C^P.,1648) in which it waspcinted out that it was by no means certain that continuedsubsidisation by the State was necessary in order to keepcanals in being.    Moreover, the experience of operation without the support of a subsidy would afford a good -test of relative usefulness, while the absence of Statesupport and the necessity for working canals on a stricteconomic
 economic basis would have a steadying influence on labour. In the event of the Minister of Transport&apos;s proposals being adopted, it was suggested that tolls and charges should be increased at the earliest possible moment; that the State should assume the smallest possible obligation consistent with the continued work of the canals; that certain canals should be allowed to become derelict; and that the agreement should not extend in any case beyond the 31st March, 192?.

On behalf of the proposals it was urged that this was a step in the direction of getting rid of a subsidy, that before an advance was made to help any particular canal the consent of the Treasury would be obtained, that there was no question of an increaded charge on the Vote for 1920/21, though it would be necessary to modify the wording of the Estimate which had not yet been passed and that advances would be restricted to a limited period.

The Conference decided -

To approve the proposals set out in the memorandum of the Minister of Transport (C.P.1596).

TREATMENT STRIKE OF MEMBERS OF THE ELECTRICAL TRADES UNION IN THE EVENT OF NON-RECOGNITION OF THEIR UNION BY THE POSTMASTER GENERAL.

2. The Conference had under consideration Memoranda by the Minister of Labour (C.P.1598), the First Commissioner of Works (C.P.1626), and the Postmaster General (C.P.1633), relative to the situation which had arisen in consequence of the refusal of the Postmaster General to recognise the Electrical Trades Union.

On the one hand it was pointed out that other Government Departments had recognised and negotiated with the E.T.U. and that the continued refusal of the Postmaster General to have any dealings with the Union might result in the withdrawal of members of the E.T.U. from Government work all over the country, causing serious dislocation and inconvenience to all Departments, particularly



    
particularly the Office works.

0n behalf of the Post Office it was ?ted that the Post Office Engineering Union has for many years been recognised as the Association representing the rank and file of the Engineering Department of the Post Office. This Union has 20,000 members - roughly 4/5 of the total number of employees. The E.T.U.? on the other hand, only claims 1,500 Post Office members, and there is reason to believe that this ? is grossly exaggerated. There is great friction between the two Unions, and the Post Office Engineering Union has recently passed a resolution threatening in the event of the Post Office granting recognition to the E.T.U., to bring about a general cessation of work in the Engineering Department. In the view of the Postmaster General, it was most inadvisable to have any dealings with the. E.T.U. and if a communication refusing recognition was to be made to that Union, this should, be done through the medium of the Ministry of Labour, and not through the Post Office.

It was. agreed:-

(1) to approve the proposal, of the Postmaster General to refuse to accord recognition to the E.T.U. in any form.

(2) that this decision should be communicated to the Union by a letter signed by the Postmaster General.

POST OFFICE AND TELEGRAPH BILL.

3. The Conference had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (C .P.L1642) appealing against the decision of the Home affairs Committee (Meeting 67), Conclusion 5, to approve Clause 4 of the Post Office and Telegraph Bill which repealed Section 6 of post Office Act(1908) exempting letters of seamen and soldiers from the ordinary rates of postage in certain circumstances. The repeal of this privilege had been urged by the Post Office, both on the ground of administrative convenience and because the present high rates of Army
and Ifcrv? pay rejo&amp;exed. il^s-^^On behalf of the oerviee Departments,: it was pointedout that this concession was one of long standing, and thatgreat importance was attached tc the privilege, especiallyin the case of troops serving abroad who should not be givenoanse for discontent by the unnecessary withdrawal of aprivilege which had been so long secured to them by statute.while it was.true that the privilege had fallen intodesuetude during the war when free postage was in eperationit was felt that at the present time when many men wereserving abroad under conditions approximating to war conditions that any attempt to impose the full postage rate would be bitterly resented.In the course of the discussion it transpired thsA-vdien-the privilege was first given the - Id.    ratepaid by the soldier and sailer was substantially l^werthan either the domestic or the foreign ratesj thereduction of the domestic rate to -    14*    meant that the privilege only applied to men on foreign servico and the fixing prior to the war of the Imperial postage at Id.caused the privilege to fall into desuetude -   While theConference thought that there was a strong case for givingthe man serving abroad the privilege of postage at the domestic rate,  it was also felt that present elreumsitanoesjustified continuing the war privilege of free postage inthe case of men serving abroad under war conditions,,vIt was agreed -(1) that men on foreign service under normal peace conditions should pay postage at the domestic rate (new Sd. ).(2). that in any particular/ the . quest!?n whetherthe men en foreign service, we re serving under war conditions (and so eligible for freepostage] er peace conditions (and so eligiblefor the domestic rate) should be settled bythe lighting Department concerned and. thePostmaster deneral;. in the different of dis---. agreement the case to.be referred to theChancellor of the-Exchequer, whose decision should be final.
Mr MING OF (4)     The Conference had tender- eonsi deration a MemorandumRlforcesTHE COLON-   &quot;by the Overseas Subcommittee of the Committee of ImperialSAND PRQ- \; &apos;$$ORATES.       Defence  (Paper C ,1 .D.-125-C) calling attention to the greatimportance of doing everything possible under existing conditions to encourage the Colonies and Protectorates tomaintain efficient local military f oroetj, and suggesting -(I) That the rifles and ms.ohi2i&apos;e&apos;*-vjt&quot;aj2? &apos;3^c^s-saryto, re-arm the locfel rzl^btfy ana s-emi-military police fio^C       together with an initial issue of ammunition at 500- roundsper riflo and lO^OOO rounds per madbin^-^a^should, be grv&quot;en-jx3 the local Governmentsfree of charge:(iij That this should be done on th^^urrifiJ*ei^rnrTzLr^that the Locaal Go^s^tiaerulas&quot; wjCLl pay for allpacking and transit chargea^ and for The-wfuinre-maintrenance of all arms and &quot; ammmiivLon.-The Memorandum stated that it was estimated that the totalnumber of rifled required would not exceed 50,000, and thetotal number of machine-guns would not exceed 150.It was agreed  To approve the recommendations of the OverseasSub-Committee, on thy understanding that itshould be made clear to tho Colonies and Pro-protectorates concerned, that vhe present issue was an act of grace and that the future maintenance of the arms and ammunition was a matter solely for thelocal Governments.pPbSED STATE      (5)     The Conference had before them a Memorandum by thefan in aidI VOLUNTARY   Minister of Health (Paper CP,-1578) drawing attention to thellpTALS 9grave position of the voluntary hospitals throughout thecountry and the necessity of some assistance from public funds if the entire breakdown of the voluntary system was tobe averted.     The situation was aggravated by the reduc-tion-JLnthe number of military patients and a reduction of the income from subscriptions, attributable to the effects of increased taxation and the rise in the cost of living, as well as bythe augmentation of wages and expenses generally.     The pro-poeal of the Ministry of Health was that a grant of  100,000should be sanctioned on condition that the aggregate of the
yo-lurifceocy -srfoSKrrip^ions. and- 3crnMrLo*i0- r^vLsod .*ot hcsrpd tale-xdxcring 1920 -amounted to no less than the total raised fromvoluntary sources during 1919, and a further grant not-exce*3dlng  400,6)00 on the following terms :-(I)     50,000 for the first  100,000 by whichthe income from voluntary subscriptionsfor 1920 exceeds that for 1919:(ii)     75,000 for the second  100,000 by whichthe income of 1919 is exceeded:(iii)    1 for  1 for any increase in voluntary contributions beyond the first  200,000,At the sane time, the Memorandum laid great stress on theimportance of maintaining the hospitals on a voluntary basis as the voluntary system was more economical than the alterna-tive of State hospitals; while, if that system were allowedto collapse, there wotild be an irrestible demand forhospitals to be taken over by the S1*ate or the localAuthorities.   There was also a growing agitation in&apos;favourof hospitals being maintained from public funds, and this wathe avowed policy of tho Labour Party,    The view of theTreasury, on the other hand, was that hospitals were essen-tially local institutions and must look to local support,whether public or private, for their maintenance.In respect of a suggestion that the Prince of Wales&apos;Fund might he  asked to make a large contribution to meet theexisting drficit, it was stated-that the Trustees of the already been approached on the subject and that they hadFund hacyno legal &apos; powe1 to make such contribution, as theadministration of the Fund was strictly confined to personswho had been injured during the T&apos;ar*Some discussion followed., In the course of which theCabinet were reminded of the great increase of expenditure which had to be provided for In the Supplementary Estimates..It was generally agreed that it was essential tomaintain the voluntary system., if possible,, and. it wasdecided -
SS-STTtlATIOW! MESOPOTAJTIA,ji&amp;ithah.(a). That the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Health should ascertain the exact legal position of the Prince ofWales1 Fund, and whether it would not bepossible, under the terras of the Trust,for a large contribution to be made with .a view to wiping out the present deficits:.(b)  If this were found to he not legally possible,or otherwise impracticable, to sanction an ad hoc grant of an amount hot exceedingEl?00,(TOO, to be distributed on a basisagreed upon&apos; by the Chancellor of theExchequer and.the Minister ,of health in consultation.(6)   The Cabinet took note of a telegram received by the secretary of State for War dealing with the situation inMesopotamia..     On Monday,. July 19th, the leading columnhad reached a point four miles north-west of Ruraaithah,where strong opposition was encountered,. a strong force,of the enemy holding three lines of embankments and using bombs and machine-guns,   A prolonged engagementtook place.    The fighting was severe, but our attack was- successful,  and a counter-attack by the enemy afterdark was beaten off.    The enemy were bombed and machine-gunned with effect by aeroplanes which co-operated, withthe troops.NTS FOR (7)    The Conference had under consideration a MemorandumTREATMENTTUBERCULOSIS, by the Minister of Health (Paper C.P^-1588) pointing outthat the National Health&apos; Insurance Act, 1990, provided,inter alia, for the discontinuance of Sanatorium Benefit.It became essential, therefore, In order to secureefficient provision in every area, to introduce legislationimposing Upon the County and County Borough Councils thestatutory duty of providing adequate institutional treat-ment.   The question therefore arose of what assistance should be given from the Exchequer to the County and CountyBorough Councils in view of the insurance money they would now lose through the passing of the recent Insurance Act.The Memorandum/
recommended that the Government should sanction, whonSanatorium Benefit ceased, that Councils Should receive an exchequer grant equivalent to the amounts thoy now receive from the Insurance Committees, in addition to the presentgrant of 50 por cent of their net expenditure after thededuct ion of the former grant,     -The Treasury, on the otherhand, proposed an arrangement under which the annual grant to each Council in respect of tho treatment of /tuberculosisshould be fixed at the total amount actually received bythe Council in tho financial year ending March 31, 1920,either from the Insurance Coiimiittoe or the Government grant,until such time as the expenditure of the Council justified ahigher grant on the 50 per cent basis.     The Memorandumpointed out that the effect of this proposal would be thatall additional expenditure incurred, by the Councils in excessof the expenditure during 1919-30 would be thrown on the ratesuntil the additional expenditure exceeded their- presentIncome from insurance funds.It was agreed  -To adjourn the further consicleration ofthe question until..tha.prime 1 rnn tti rti s-hmv snuldbe presents(8)   The Conference were informed that the Boaru of customs and Excise had recently been asked to extend theirpresent arrangements for the examination of baggage and cargoentering Ireland with a view to preventing the irregularimportation of arms and ammunition, and they had accordinglydespatched a large number of additional officials to thatcountry.    These officials had now expressed their desire tobe allowed to return to England, as they were really in fearof their lives owing to threats received from ainn Feinersas to what would happen to them should they stop theimportation of anas.After some discussion,  it was agreed  
2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1;July 21st, 1920.- 9(a) To withdraw the additional Customs&apos; \ officials from Ireland:(h) That the Chairman of the Board of customs and Excise should,  in con-saltation with the Hobbe Offioe,... arrange for the examination at ports inGroat Britain of cargo and.passengers&apos;effeets de-st ine d for Irelan d. &amp;&quot;PROPOSED (95   After a short disucssion on the. question of theINCREASED1 PASSENGER propesed increase of. passenger rates on the railways of the fate OH &apos; &apos; &apos;   vi the FAILWAYS^   United Kingdom, in the course of which Sir George Beharrailbriefly explained the present situation,  The Minister ef Transport undertook tooiroulate &quot;to the Cabinet the Reportof the Rates Advisory Committee on a.   date which would allow Ministers ampletime to consider the Committee&apos;srecommendations.
