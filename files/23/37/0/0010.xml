llj! PRICE In accordance with a decision of the Cabinet,  reachedI&quot;COAL.at a Meeting on the previous day (cabinet 8 (19),  Con-clusion 7),  the Conference met to consider the question ofthe price of Coal.The president of the Board of Trade gave a brief reviewof the events which led   up to the 6/- increase in theprice of coal,  and reminded the Conference that during the debate on the subject in the House of Commons the Govern-ment undertook to reduce the price of coal if the outputexceeded the estimated figure of 217,000,000 tons for 1919.The present position was that the output for the whole period since the 6/* increase had been under the rate of217,000,000 tons,  so that if the Government regarded merely the letter of their undertaking they were n**t bound in anyway to reduce the price of real.    It was his opinion, how-ever,  that if the undertaking were interpreted in the spirit and not in the letter,   some reduction would have to be made.The reason was that larger quantities of coal had been ex-ported at far greater prices than had ever been expected.These coal exports had provided a big profit,  taking theindustry as a whole,  although the ooal used for householdpurposes and industry in this country was being sold on anaverage at less than cost price.    In effect,  industrial and household coal was being subsidised out of the large profits made by export coal.The objection to an all-round reduction in the priceof coal was that the inland collieries who were not ex-porting would cease to pay their way,  and Would claimfinancial support from the Government.    He was of opinionthat industry as a whole,  with the possible exception ofthe iron and steel industries,  could very well afford to pay/- a ton more for coal than they were doing at present.The profits being made by industries were enormous,  and he-thought it was unsound to increase those profits out of temporary profits of certain coal-mines when the reoult
would &quot;be that many inland coal-min^s would cease to pay.He desired to suggest that the profits made on export  coal should he employed to effect a reduction in the pric--&apos; o^domestic coal and coal used by public Utility companies forthe X &apos;*duction of household gas and electric light, but thatth-r-* should b^ no reduction in the price of industrial coal.It would be far easier to administer this limited reductionthan a reduction over the output of th- whole industry.As regards bunker coal, this was Sold at -world-prices,except in th&quot; case of the United Kingdom coastwise trade.This trade was allowed, to purchase coal at pric-s . which,although less than world-prices, were still wry high.    Hethought that it would be advisable to reduce the price ofcoastwise bunk-rs, as such a reduction would diminish theamount of the subsidy at present being paid to coa.sbv.aseshipping by the Ministry of Transport under the scheme fordiverting traffic from the railways to the coasting traderAs regards foreign-going ships, h?^ understood that in theprevious w*-ek bunkers cost from 105&quot;/* to 107/- p^r ton, sscompared &quot;&apos;ith 10/-* p; r ton pre-war rates.    This enormousincrease in price naturally raised the cost of goods, and made it v--ry difficult for a large number of liners to pay.their way.    The Shipping Controller feared that he &apos;-would have to call on the Treasury to make good the differencebetween the Blue^Book Rates (which were bas d on an assumedrate of 35/** per ton for cost of coal) and the actual costOf running to shipowners.    On the whole, he thought thatthe House of Commons might be informed that the output ofcoal is rising so much that action would be taken on thefollowing lines(i) The price of domestic coal ^&apos;0uld be reducedby 10/- a ton, and a similar reduction wouldbe made in the price of coal us^d for theproduction of household gas and electricity:(ii) The price of coastwise bunkers would bereduced:
( iii) Th^ price&apos;0f &quot;bunkers for foreirr-going ships-would he reduced in cas^s-where the shipahad been chartered or requisitioned by theBrat i sh Government,A general discussion followed;  during the course ofwhich- -it was agreed that, while :the letter of the Government&apos;undertaking in July did not call for any reduction in theprice of coal,  the spirit of that-undertaking did require areduction^. - It wa - also pointed out that the miner0 would undoubtedly point to that undertaking and accure the Govern-ment of making huge profits out of the 6/-  increase, &apos; Theincrease had been required to make coal pay its way, and inthe face of the profit on export coal it could not b&quot; nain-tained.The Conf^r^nce decided. :-(a) That a statement should be made in the Houseof Commons to the effect that the positionin the co attaining, industry had so improvedthat a reduction could now be made in theprioo of the following varieties of coal(i) Demist i c coal and coal used for theproduction of household gas an&amp;electricity - a reduction of &amp;0/**a ton:&apos;-&apos;-.(Coastwise bunkers       a cufficient reduction to neutralise the subsidy now being paidto the coasting trade. :(iii) -Foreign--going bunkers   a reductionin tho case of bunkers supplied to ships chartered or requisitioned bythe British&apos; GovernmentcThe statement should make it clear that theGovernment had thought it well&apos; to reduce theprice of coal in cases where the reduction would have the most direct effect on the costof living, but t&quot;-at in   the Governments opinionit was not possible&apos;to reduce the price of allcoal consumed in the United Kingdom.(b) Tliat the export cf coal should be limited,in order to prevent foreign countries ffomdenuding this- country of coal supplies:id) That coalowners&apos; profits should be&apos; limited;(d) That there should be a strict limitation onthe domestic use of coal:(o) That a scheme should be prepared to makeeach coal-producing district self-supporting,so a.s to eliminate the present discrepancybetween profits in diff-.&quot;r^nt areas:
(f) That the preference which is at pre&quot;being, given to Allies importing. Britishcoa.1 should not Toe abolished..(;g) That,   g.o far as possible,  Italy ehouldbe given favourable treatment in regardto imports of British coal,- and that ifthe Government -&quot;ere attacked on thoground that excessive profits on coal exports rore bcihg made at the expenseof the Allies,, the reply should be thata preference over other countries is givento Allied&apos;countries importing British coal.&apos;4: * V.2 Whitehall Gardens, .
