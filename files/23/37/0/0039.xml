M, Millerand was particularly anxiousto keep this meeting as secret as possible, though, some hinthad already leaked out in the ^French Press of a meeting totake place at some quiet spot on the coast of Normandy.IISH EMPIRE     (3) It was generally agreed that a meeting of the British1BGAT18N   POSED MEET- Empire Delegation should take place before the Prime Minis-OP.ter&apos;s meeting with M. Millerand.    In view of Mr Watts1 resig-nation from the pest of Treasurer of the Australian Common-wealth, it would be necessary to communicate with Mr Hughes,the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, in regard to australian -lian representation.    Sir George Perley, the Canadian HighCommissioner, had been nominated to represent the Dominion.The Secretary of State for the Colonies had been nominated by&apos;the New Zealand Government to represent them pending the arrival of Sir James Allen, and General Smuts had given an indication of the views of the Union Government, withoutasking for special representation (Paper C.P.-1S47).  *It was agreed  (a) That a Meeting of the British empire delegation should be held on Friday,June 18, 1930:(b) That the Secretary should notify this to the Cabinet and to Sir George Perley:(0) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should telegraph to tho PrimeMinister of Australia in regard toAustralian representation at the meetingof the British Empire Delegation,

He had been inform-Of EUROPE.ed that before the War the principal news services on theContinent of Europe had been in German and Austrian hands,and the principal news centres had been Berlin, Vienna and constantinople.    Since the War the news services from thesecentres had passed almost entirely into French hands.    TheFrench news service was conducted mainly as French propaganda,, ,      . . sometime?)and French policy was belaudedyat the expense of British.Reuters had now offered to establish news centres in Berlin,Vienna and Constantinople, for which purpose they would require a subsidy of  15,000 a year.   The subject could net be decided in the absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but thePrime Minister wished the Departments concerned to study thequestion, with a view to its discussion at a very early date.It was pointed out that an arrangement already existedwhereby Reuters undertook to send abroad suoh British news asthe Government desire.   The difficulty was, however, to getthe news published.   The question, therefore, had to be con-sldered whether this could best be achieved by the means nowproposed or by some other method. ,It was agreed --
WSSM WASIOI! (6) The Conference were Informed that, with K.Krassln&apos;s0]? Ph.-t0J.A4consent, the important and reassuring statement hp had madeas to the Russian attitude in Persia, at the meeting held onMonday,  June 7 (I.C.P.-109 E,, pages 14 and 15), had been communicated to the Secretary-General of the League of nations for the information of the Council.    It would seem probable,therefore, that the Council would advise Persia to get intocommunication with the Soviet Government, and that further action by the Council would be postponed until after these negotiations and until it was known whether the Soviet Govern-ment were in fact carrying out the intention,announced by M.Kraasin, to leave Enzeli.It was pointed out, however, that the Persian Foreign-Minister would, in all probability,  consult the Council ofthe League as to what would happen if the Soviet government did not carry out their undertakings, and also a3 to theattitude which Persia should take up in regard to the probabledemand of the Soviet Government for direct representation atTeheran.mm OFlIIONS -EITISHTOtTDEGUARDS.Nhen.ftimania.(7) Reference was made to the Debate to take place in theHouse of Commons on Thursday, June 17, 1920.    The question was raised as to whether the best possible use was in factbeing made of the machinery of the League of Nations.In this connection it was pointed out that the Czecho-Slovak Government had invited the Council of the League ofNations to consider the Teschen question.It was suggested that the following questions might with advantage be referred to the Council of the League ofNations under Article 11:-(a) THE TERRITORIAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN LITHUANIAAND POLAND.It waa pointed out that Lithuania was in a very diffi-oult position in the matter.   The Lithuanians prefer theRussian people to the Poles, and believe that their future economic interests lie in Russia. On the other hand, they-4-
is.biA,IsOPOTAMIA,Ilestine,KPT, andlEKBY.prefer Polish to Bolshevist theories of government, andbelieve that the maintenance of Poland with reasonablefrontiers is in the interests of Lithuania.. But all parties agree in demanding from the Poles full recognition of lithuania-anian independence and the cession of Vilna. (For further details see telegram from Mr Tallents, Kovno, No.7%, ofJune 8. 1920.)(b) THE QUESTION CF THE AALAND ISLANDS,which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has repeated-ly urged on the Swedish Government ought to be referred bythem to the Council of the League of Nations.

(d) The slow arrival of the/Italian Division-in the Constantinople area,- and the attitudeof: the Italian Government, which tended tobe, geiier ally favour ah le to the turkish nationalist forces..... After some discussion, on the Cabinet business of thefollowing week,, it was agreedThat the whole of - these questions should bediscussed by a Conference of Ministers not later than Thursday, June 1*7th 1920,It was further agreedThat Lord Curzon should endeavour to arrangefor a postponement of the question, to beraised in the House of Lords on Tuesday,June 15th, on the subject of mesopotamia and Persia..    .    .    .    *    *&apos;Thritehall Gardens, S,^,l,June 11th 1920...6-
