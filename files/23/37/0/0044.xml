? SETTLEMENT POLICY.

1. With reference to Cabinet 37(20), Conclusion 7, the Conference had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture (C.P.?), covering draft Paragraphs intended to serve as the basis of a Circular to be issued to Local Authorities for guidance in administering the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act. These paragraphs incorporated the previsiona1 decisions reached at Cabinet 37(20) and provided, inter alia. (1) that names of new applicants should be entered on a separate list, such applicants being informed that they cannot be dealt with under the present scheme, or until the needs of the approved applicants have been met. (2) That owing to building difficulties the authorities should concentrate on the acquisition of such land as will require a minimum expenditure upon buildings, or can be let without equipments. (3) That to the utmost extent possible, land should be leased or should be purchased by means of County annuities under the facilities contained in the Act of 1919, and that care should be taken to see that the applicants are not provided with unnecessarily large holdings, and that special preference is given to men who served overseas during the war as against men who only served at home.

It was pointed out that the publication of a Circular on these lines would create grave dissatisfaction throughout the country, and would provoke charges of breach of faith.

In the absence of the Secretary for Scotland, Sir Robert Greig stated that the position in Scotland was very similar to that in England, though the difficulty of providing buildings was not so acute. The


The feeling in Scotland had- already led to land beingraided, and the Secretary for Scotland was in favourof the question of policy being re-opened,   Ont theother hand it was pointed out that the provision ofadditional money.to meet all claims in Scotland wouldinvolve an increase of 10 millions for that countryand possibly an increase of 60 &quot;millions for England, .and that it was quite clear that Scotland and Englandmust be treated exactly alike, -Ultimately the Conference decided:-To re-affirm the decision on the questionof policy reached at Cabinet 37 (20) and terequest&apos; the&apos;Departments concerned to &apos;agree the terms of a draft circular:to -be issued simultaneously to Local Authoritiesin&apos;the United kiiigdom, this draft circular to be submitted to the Cabinet by theMinister of Agriculture as soon as possible after the return from Scotland of Mr.Munro*-BONUS ON dear      2m -   The Conference had under consideration a joint&apos;PENSIONS. -Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and the Ministerof Labour (C.PB1464) recommending that iti view of theincrease ih the cost of living since the rates ofpensions and allowances were fixed in Septemberi 1919,weekly bonuses should be granted of -(a)    5/- a week In the cdse of d&amp;abled mendrawing total disablement pension, orIh receipt of allowances in respect of either medical treatment or training,at the minimum pension ratesCb)   2/6 a week to all widows over 4ft&apos; or havingchildren tinder their cares(c)   2/6 a week to all dependents In receiptof a pension based on need.The rates of bonuses to be payable for seven months from the 1st September, 1920 at an estimated cost of 2,250,000.   Also a Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C.P.1464A0covering a- Treasury letter dated22nd June 1920 setting forth the Treasury objections
to the grant of any tenperary bonuses to ^ar pensioners,end criticising the basis of the -amounts of bohU3proposed.The attention of the Conference was also directed to the answer given by Hr., Bonar Law on the l^th june to a Question in the House of Commons by lit.- Charles&quot;Thite (CP. 1464.B.)On behalf of the proposals it was stated that sincethe agreement of September 1919 ,7&amp;s reached, the -cost ofliving figures shewed an increase of 30 per cent.    The&apos;totally disabled new felt very strongly that they oughtto be.accorded similar treatment to the ordinary employees in industry.whose wages were subject to adjustment whenever the cost of living index figures materially altered.These men, unlike the partially disabled men, got no benefit from the increase in wages.      It was also pointedout that since th* scale was fixe a men outside industry had received advances1 ranging&apos; from 8/- to 16/- a week(15% to 2%) which compared favourably with the I2j$increase now proposed for the pensioners.On the hand it was pointed out that thedecision to fix the rates for three years was taken bythe House of Commons in tho supposed interests of the pensioners, that- it was extremely improbable thata concession once made could be confined to the totally-disabled men and that if the settlement was oncere-opened.in favour of the latter,  on. the1 ground of -the inetreased ,cost of living, it would be impossiblelogically to refuse similar concessions to all pensioners.Moreover, it would be particularly difficult to withholda concession to the partially disabled man out ofemployment since his posit ion would&apos; be then practically
idorrti-cal -with &quot;that of &quot;^the R.T.^ -It...was also pointed out that the settlement in questiongave the pensioners increases at a cost Of  2.2,000,000per annum and in the result placed then in   a far better position than war pensioners in Prance or any other country.In Connection with the suggestion that it wasimprobable that priecs would fall before next spring,it was pointed out that the wholesale prices showed a tendency to fall and that freight-rates -&quot;ere . falling.At the same time, it was felt that the question ofthe abolition of the Bread Subsidy which,  if decided upon, would mean a substantial rise in the cost ofliving index number had ah important bearing on thepresent question.It was ultimately decided:*-To postpone further consideration of thequestion of a bonus on pensions until adecision had been reached on the questionof the continuance of the Bread Subsidy.LLOfANCES FOR   3.      The Conference had under consideration (l) AKGrLE MEN UNTJER-JUSfG TRAINING   Memorandum by the Minister of. Labour (CP. Z*yD8) askingbo haveIpikdentIlatives.as from the 1st July, 1920 that a single man in trainingliving at home, and with a widowed mother dependentupon him, should be granted an allowance of .10/- aweek, at an estimated cost of  240,000 per annum, and(2) A Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. 1508.A.)covering a Treasury letter dated 22nd June, 1920,particularising the Treasury objections to the proposals.In the unavoidable absence of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer the Conference decided:-To defer consideration of this question. to a future meeting when the Chancellorcould be present.
(!)      With reference to the 54th Minutes&apos;of theHome Affairs Committee, Conclusion 5, theConference had under consideration a memorandumtoy the Minister of&apos; Health (CP.1543) on theaction t-^ken toy certain local authorities to compel those employed by them to join tradeunions.    It was. - explained in the memorandum that certain Borough Councils were steadily pur-suing a policy of coercion in regard to non-unionists and that in one&apos;instability ce the followingresolution had been Issued as a poster -&quot;That all employees of this Council be membersof their respective trade unions&quot;-.    It was ex-plained to the Conference that the Ministry ofHealth had caused the matter to be examined care-fully, and it was clear that they had no legal,powers to prevent such action being taken, althoughit was felt that an intolerable position was beingcreated in some places for persons who had beenmany years in the employment of local authorities,and at the risk of losing their places, w ere beingbullied&apos;into taking a course of which they did not approve.   -Dt was suggested that the law officers should be asked to explore the question and toadvise whet legislation could be framed to preventundue pressure being exercised on those employedby local authorities.    On the other hand, it waspointed out that the trade unions were, at themoment, very sensitive to criticism of any kind&apos;,and that it would be a bad time to raise contro-versy on such a question&apos;.After some discussion the Conference agreed,
without coming to any decision as to thegeneral question of policy to request the Committee of Home affairs with the assistance of the Law officers to examine the matter from every point:  of view and. to report thereon to theCabinet.(5)   V/ith. reference to Conclusion 3 of aConference of Ministers of December .9th, 1919,ihe. Meeting had under consideration a memeran-dum by the Secretary of State for War (CP. 1344)with reference to the way in which the BelgianGovernment proposed to deal with the ruins of ypres.  .It appeared that opinion in Belgium was divided, and that while It had been decided bythe Belgian Government to preserve the ruinsof the Clotii   Hall and the Cathedral as, a mem-orial of the War the Burgomaster of Ypres- had succeeded in changing the decision in orderto meet his proposal for rebuilding the townincluding the houses fronting on the Clclh   Halland the Cathedral.   In consequence of this de*clsion, it would shortly become neoessary toremove the ruins.    It was    *he1-A&apos;      that theruins of Ypres^ stood, to the British nation assymbols of the Great War and of the sacrificewhich the British Army had made in the field of Flanders, and, that a protest should be madeto the Bel-gj^ua--Govfei*nment against the proposalto remove them.    It was. suggested to the Meeting,however, that it would toe most Improper to dictateto the Government of a foreign country on a matter which.they might justifiably hold was one in which

Warbe authorised to ask the Foreign Pfflee-to inform the Belgian Government that before they allowed anything to be; donethat would imperil the pornament pre-servation of the ruins., the BritishGovernment would like to have an oppor-tuhity of expressing their view.&apos;(6)       The Minister of Health drew the attentionof the Conference to a number of requests hehad received from the Royal College of Physicians,the Royal Medical Society, and cher scientificbodies, that steps should be taken to hold ain memorymemorial service/of the late Surgeon Generalof the United States ArmyGorgas/at St...Paul&apos;s Cathedral, or        other suitable place of worship, in recognition of thegreat service he had rendered to humanity in hisstudy of the,oauses and prevention of tropicaldiseases.The Conference agreed that the BritishGovernment should approve the proposalto hold a memorial s ervice in memory. of the late Surgeon General Gorgas .stsome suitable place of worship.
