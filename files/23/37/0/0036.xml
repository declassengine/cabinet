Oj)T?.Q$i ?*f - (D With reference to Cabinet. 25 (20), Cone-conclusion 1,SAiS and &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;     &apos; &quot;        -     ia ;: Ri&amp;J^^ them a,Memorandum toy the Pre&amp;xaentof tho Board, of Trade- (Paper G,Po 3-336). proposing that thecontrol of the wholesale&apos; price.; and. the re tail price of coal-Should be stool is-herd., -with the object of making the consumer. pay a1 proper economic; - price for coal, and of allowing dis-:-    tribution .to flow, back, as far as possible., into its. pre--&quot;-&apos; war c hann els.-It was - explained to tho-Conference that the- initiative-tive of the coal trado had been.very largely destroyed toythe control imposed during the war..   Neither coal-owners,merchants nor retailers wore interested in the quality ofthe coal produced, and laid tho tolame for the inferiorquality on the Goal Controller-     The proposal to. de-roontrolwholesale and retail prices flowed naturally from thedecision which had already been taken by tho Cabinet to de-control distribution.    If this proposal were adopted, therewould only remain the control over exports and the controlover the pitTs mouth price.      The regulation of home prices;   --  would then be left (apart from the control over the pifsmouth price)  to the operation, of the. Profiteering Act.    Thestandard of prof it. allowed, under .the Acts which at presentaffected the coal trade would ..give an adequate guide to; :&apos;       Profiteering Committees,, -Whilensanj merchants would be in aposition to supply at,a lower price than those Acts allowed.-    It &quot;-was-, true that, owing-, to. the shortage of coal, it mightbe feared that Certain, purchasers, for instance, prosperousmanufacturers, would offer a premium for coal if the presentcontrol over prices,.were , relaxed.-,, but it was confidently-expected that- the- coal trade themselves would co-operate to prevent any such action.      At the present time the-atmosphere in the coal trade was one of co-operation with&quot;the Government     For the first.time since the imposition ofcontrol, both -owners ana merchants were working with theGovernment in the policy of de-control..  The-Coal Supply-1-
 Committee would still operate, and would be able to control coal merchants whom they supplied. The merchants had voluntarily undertaken to impose control on their own dealings, and a recent meeting of 2,000 coal merchants had given enthusiastic support to the policy of the Government. The merchants realised that any suspicion of profiteering or of  favouritism in the allocation of supplies would be fatal to de-control and would lead to a demand for municipal trading in coal and eventually to the extinction of their own business.

Some discussion took place as the effect on the trade or the country and more particularly on the foreign exchanges, of the continued restrictions on the export of coal. It was pointed out that in 1913 British exports amounted to 73,000,000 tons, where? in the present year they were expected to amount to some 20,000,000 tons, of which 9,000,000 would be allocated to France, 4,000,000 to Italy, and only 7,000,000 to other countries. The result would be that ships would leave this country empty, and imports -- particularly imports of food -- would have to bear the cost of a double freight. It was therefore suggested that it would be better now to check the present feverish industrial activity by relaxing the restrictions on the export of coal than to subsidise industry generally at the expense of the coal trade and, incidentally, of importers in this country. A decrease in industrial activity was inevitable, and the sooner it came the better. At present wages were being forced up from day to day, and manufacturers were willing to pay any price for labour, since they know that they could well afford it. When business became more slack the country would be left with a huge liability in wages. This liability could, at any rate, be decreased by allowing a freer export of coal.

In reply, it was pointed out that the slackening of industrial activity had already begun. while manufacturers  
had&apos;sufficient otaors to carry then over the next fewmonths,.- the business: community were agreed that the poakof industrial activity- had - teen &quot;reached in April,, and that.such, activity was-now&apos;on . the downward grade..  It -was not desirable to accelerate this tendency by increasing exports.of coal, particularly as it was economically more paying to export finished and semi-finished goods than goods such ascoalwhich underwent ho&apos; manufacturing processes.The Conference accordingly agreed --5?o accept the proposals sat forth in theMemorandum by the President -of the Boardof Trade (Paper 0,P.-1336), viz., that -the present control of wholesale and. re-&apos;tail prices of coal should be abolished,-but that the pit&apos;s mouth price should remain under-control.
ipfll of fB) Wit^i reference to Qablnet 25(29^ Conclusion 1 *f MajBis-&quot;tion       6th 1920, the Conference had before then a Joint memorandumal&apos;by the President cf tho Board of Trade and the Minister ofTransport (0.P.1362) regarding tho decontrol of inland dis-tribution of coal.     The memorandum pointed out that in orderto ensure supplies of coal for home requirements exports had recently been anrtailed..     In oonooquenoe coal from SouthWales and the north-east coast of England had beon divertedinland instead of being exported.    The diverted coal had beentaken by the Railways and it was suggested that this proce-dure, which would release some 60,000 tons of coal per week from midland collieries for industrial, public utility, and household purposes inland, should be continued.    This would,however, throw upon the Railway Companies a heavy financial burden since they would bo compelled to purchase coal at ahigher price and haul it for longer distances..    The increasedburden, whioh was estimated at  2,000,000 per annum shouldnot, it was suggested, be accepted by the Railways or trans-ferred by them to the public, but should be not out of the pool resulting from the financial arrangements between theCoal Mines Department and the Coal Owners.The Conference were informed that at the present timesufficient coal was not being raised in those areas whichordinarily meet inland requirements to supply both the Rail-ways and ether inland consumers.     The restriction on theexport of South Wales and Northumberland and Durham coal hadrelieved the scarcity due to the diminished output of coalas oompared with the pre-war output, but this restriction in itself was not sufficient since it was necessary to con-trol the buying operations of the Railways and inland con-sumers,   For instance purchasers in the north of Englandcould not be allowed to buy coal from South -Vales since thetransport of coal from South Wales to the north would resultin hopeless confusion- on the railways.     It was therefore proposed to deal with the matter by making a comerehensivearrangement with the railway companies whereby these companies/companies would, purchase the coal from South Wales andNorthumberland and Durham.
Attention was drawn to the fact that, whereas therevenue on .profits from the-export of coal was not receiveduntil a considerable time after the exports took place., theproposed expenditure of  2;000,000 would take place at once;so that in effect the Treasury would be called on to finance the- present transaction for something like a year,     Thefinancial position of the coal industry was that some 1.2,000,000 to  15,000,000 had been written off as a deadloss, and that some  15,000,000 would be required to meet&apos;the advance in wages to the miners c      The Treasury could, not,therefore, finance the present proposals for a year.  -  Theproposed expenditure of  2,000,000 was, in effect.., a. subsidy to manuf ac.tur.ers f since the arrangement would enable manufact-manufacturers to buy coal at a cheaper rate than would be possible if. the. srailway companies were allowed to compete in a freomarket-,On the other hand, emphasis was laid on the hopelessconfusion on the railways which would result- from sllowin/rboth railway companies and other- purchasers to buy coal inan unrestricted market-      The proposed subsidy of  2,000,000was only, a necessary corollary of the restriction on theexport of coal,.After some discussion as to the effect of- removing all restrictions, both on the sale abroad and the&apos;sale in thiscountry of British coal, the Conference agreed  (a) To approve the proposals set forth in theJoint Memorandum by the President of the.Board of Trade and the Minister of Trans--    port. (Paper C ..P.C-1562),  to the effect that,the increased cost of ensuring to the publiccoal -supplies in.the Midland area should he met out of the pool resulting from the  financialarrangements1 between the.&apos;Coal Mines department and the coal-owners:(b) That the President of the Board of Trade -should use every endeavour to accelerate   ,the payment. of sums due to- the Exchequerfrom the sale of export ooalg in order thatthe Exchequer might, so far as possible, be relieved from Athe. burden of financing the-proposed expenditure of  2 ,000&apos;,000 *gaga&apos;a.:aa:;..&quot;&apos;-&apos;:,        g;f:aggagggg\gg/&apos;gg-K: &apos;gg: ggg- &apos;. gaggggggggggg?ggg aggigggiggglgfi
ASTAL- - (-3)    with reference to Cabinet 29 -(550) , Conclusion 7, and cabinet 22 (20), Conclusion 2  (at  mich it was- decided thatthe subsidy to coastal, shipping should terminate -in .the. middle &apos;of May and that the Shipping1 Controller, should call a Ccn-ference of the shipowners concerned and communicate -thisdecision to them), the Conference had before them a. Joint-Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and theShipping Controller (Paper 0.-.?-.-1199) reporting the result cf.a Conference which they had held with the shipping ownersconcerned in the coasting trade-.      The shipowners had statedthat if -the coastal subsidy scheme were withdrawn withoutany steps being taken to deal with competitive, railway rates,it would be impossible for shipowners to continue -the presentcoastal services;    but that if the exceptional railway ratesreferred&apos;to in the Report of the Ministry of Transport RatesAdvisory Committee (C .M.D,52.5, 1919^ page 7,(C) Rates affect-ed by competition by Water) were withdrawn., the coastingservices could be continued without the subsidy..It  was explained that the coastal -subsidy had been started At a time when the railways were greatly -congested and railway rates were at pre-war figures, in order to bring backshipping to the coasting trade and so relieve congestion, the deficit being paid by the Exchequer.   Since then, railway rateshad been put up, and the congestion, also had been relieved.The Cabinet, at their meeting on April.29th, had decided that the coastal subsidy should cease, and hadsuo-rrested that coastal shipowners might be reminded of thet^t^) *     - - pV*powers of control which the Shipping Ministry still possessed.The. Conference were infarmed that, In view of the im-proved position on the railways, the Ministry of transport was now prepared to carry the traffic if - the coastal ship-owners&apos; failed to do so.   , There was general agreement in.theConference that the shipping subsidy should cease-^      Onbehalf of - the - Ministry of Shipping, however, the view was-/v.-. -        -J - ...........................................
expressed that the cessation must ho accompanied by a revision of the exceptional railway rates which had been deliberately fixed before the War to compote with coastal shipping.      It was represented that otherwise tHe coastal shipping trade would be ruined.      On tho other hand, it was stated that the revision proposed would require a prolongedenquiry into many thousands of rates, and could, not becompleted, for some considerable time,  and that tho profits made in the coastal shipping trade during the last two years were such that it was not correct to state that tho businesscould not be carried on without a subsidy.      It Was pointedout, however, that if tho competitive railway rates woreunrcmunorative to the railways, the traffic would bocarried at tho expense of the community, and it would be unfair to withdraw the coastal subsicly while indirectlysubsidising the railway companies In this way.     Doubts were expressed whether the railway traffic in question wasremunerative or not.The Conference agreed -(a) That the decision of the Cabinet that the coastal subsicly should cease should boconfirmed.(b) To request the Sinister of Transport to enquire whether tho special rates on traffic which  -was- in competition withcoastal shipping were in fact reimuiera-tivo,  and. to report there:on to theCabinet(c) To request the Minister of Transport to-   hold a meeting with coasting shipowners1representatives in order to confer onthe position..
