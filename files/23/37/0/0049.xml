(2)    Lir B aifour-xgarr^^ an account ofJae..-M^rmmnic^inx)ris which, had passed, he-tween him andthe Prime    itii st er with reference to the relations of Russia with&apos;Poland and with this country.The attention of the Conference was then called to the  telegrams exchanged between Moscow and LLJIameneffwhich, had been intercepted and deciphered.      these telegrams showed that whereas H.Gcverament wasgenuinely endeavouring to re-establish trading relationswith the- Soviet Government, the Bussian Trade delgation had in fact been actively engaged during their visitin propaganda aimed at undermining the present economic organisation, of society.Tho President of the Board of Trade stated that the damage which was being done by the Russia^ agitatorswas of so grave a nature that it .was most important   .to get there out of the country immediately.        In orderto justify this  step to the Labour movement it would be essential to make a complete exposure of their trickery-by the publication of the deciphered telegrams.11 was a gr e e d; -(1) That the time had now come to request.the Russian Trade Delegation to leave thiscountry and a complete exposure of their conduct be made in the press :-(2) That a dossier of the documents from aboutthe time of tho arrival in this country ofILkamoneff should be -prepared immediately by Sir Basil Thompson, together with thedraft ef a covering note for publication in the newspapers:(3) That hr Bonar Law should communicate these documents to the Prime Hinister with a viewto obtaining his concurrence in theirpublication.
I3H (3)    Sir James^&quot;cmd.^pea&apos;d to the Conxeren.ce a detailedI OHappreciation of the situatior^.in&quot;&apos;TJl3ter which he had prepared, from which it appeared that the position was developing unfavourably with great rapidity:    thatthe Loyalists were losing faith in the Governmentrsdetermination to protect them, and were threateningan -immediate recourse to arms, ?,rhich would precipitateCivil ./ar.Sir James Oral a proceeded to ask the Government to approve the following proposals:(a) The immediate appointment of a government authority, eig., an Under-Seoretary, in Belfast,to represent the Government in the six counties:fb) This Authority should have directaccess to the Chief Secretary, and should bethe civil Authority responsible for the mainten-ance of lav/ and order in the six Counties:(c) Moreover, in order to arrange for the transferlater of tho Administration oi the six Countiesunder the Government of Ireland Bill, he shouldhave a staff whose duty it would be to make allthe necessary preparations in conjunction withCommittees to be appointed locally:(d) A Commissioner of the Boyal Irish Constabularyshould bo appointed for the control of theConstabulary in the six Counties, and for thecomplete control md organisation, -of&quot; a&apos; special constabulary Force in&apos;that&quot;area, and to make arrangements for tne fUture&quot;&quot;*0onstabulary Force.(e) The Commander in Chief in Ireland should devolvesuch oi his powers to tho Local Military. authority in Belfast as would enable the latter to deal withany local developments, and to act in co-operationwith tho Ulster Civil Authority and with the Oommiss-practitioner without reference to Dublin Castle.(f) A Force of Special Constables should bo raised to assist the Government Forces in the maintenanceof law and order, and should bo sufficiently numerousto ensure that adequate police posts arc re-ostablish-ed throughout the six Counties, and that any new measures ordered by the Government are properlyenacted.      This force must be armed, and.detailed forgeneral duty within the six Counties only.     As faras possible the&apos; organiso,tion should be on Militarylines.      Probably a strength of 2,00C would suffice for the six Counties unless any of the troops now in ulster arc withdrawn, or unless a general risingtakes place.
(g) jb. reseorre force of Spe-o-ial - Ckmsiiabulary should heraised from tho loyal., p^ulation, which would only he called out for duty In case of emergency.     Arms should.ho issued to certain members of this force who,, when called -cut for duty, would be properly paid and indemnified by theState,      Possibly,  it would be well to swear in a verymuch larger number of persons than would be required for duty at one time.     This would enable reliefs to be formed,and would also ensure that a large proportion of thepopulation is brought, under discipline.      A special constabulary Reserve should be organised by.the Royal irish constabulary Commissioner mentioned in para-. 4. , but shouldbe commanded by their own local Loaders, and they should-obtain authority to drill and. to do musketry.-   They shouldalso be required to perform duty within the vicinity oftheir homes. -(h) The organisation of the Ulster Volunteer Force shouldbe used for this&quot; purpose, as was done for raising the36th (Ulster) Division when the War broke out.(i) The Government should announce forthwith that, in thoevent of a general rising by the rebels, with which the-existing forces might be unable to cope,  or if there shouldbe any withdrawal of tho Military Forces by the Government ,then the ulster Volunteer Force should be armed with theirown weapons, which are now under Military Control, theMembers of that Force who have -already joined the Special. Constabulary Force being armed first, if the Arms providedby the State are insufficient for. the whole Force;     Mean-while , these Arms should bo more distributed among thedifferent Military centres in tho six counties,  so as to b oavailable for local isauo,  end the U..V.P. should be permitted tc drill.(j) Government regulations dealing with Motor-Traffic,restriction of movements by night, and reprisals fordestruction of Government property, should be put Into &amp;force as soon as it can bo done effectively, but it shouldnot be applied tc tho loyal portions of Ulster until theycan also be made effective in the more disaffected part ofthe six Counties,.(k) Stops should be taken to remove all Government officials from their appointments if they refuse to take the Oath efAllegiance, and local Authorities should be instructed tcgive notice to all their Employees who decline- to pass thistest,Mr Balfour (who had- to leave before the close of the Confer-once) stated that while ho could offer be opinion on details he considered that in face of the terms of the Homo Rule Bill theGovernment would be justified in separating Ulster administrotive-ly at once from the rest of Ireland.      He was, however-,  doubtfuls-uout tho proposal to place tho Belfast Military Command directly under the Jar Office.
Sir Robert Home considered it tc be desirable toenrol a bod;/ of 8pe.oiaJ^-C-onst.ab.^ at once.rh.e disxmssion was adjourned until the chief secretary could bo present.- 5 -
(4)   Mr Balfour informed the Conference that in view of the^strong--representations which had been made for the releaseof the lord Mayor of Cork from Brixton Gaol, he had conferred with the Homo secretary and the Secretary of State for - War.In the view of the Home Office the detention of a prisoner during a proti&quot;acted hunger strike until his death was subversive of-orison discipline and administration.      It could also be urgedon behalf of the Lord Mayor that h* was a political prisonerand that it was Impossible in his case to food him forcibly ashad been done with success with othor hunger strikers.       On theother &quot;hand to release him would in effect be oquifr&amp;lent to giving up tho coercion Act -recently passed.2he Conference were reminded that tho Cabinet had decided against tho release of hunger strikers and that this decisionhad boon announced and defended by ths prime Minister in hispublished letter to tho Lord Mayor&apos;s sister.It was agreed to recommend no. change in theCabinet decision. -pritel:ali Gardens,  S.A.September 2nd 15 2G.
