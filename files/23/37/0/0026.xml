AGRICULTT7HE.       memorandum &quot;by the Ministry of .Agriculture andFisheries (CP.683) covering certain letters from theChairman of the Eoyal Commission on Agriculture, andrequesting the authority of the Cabinet to a sugges-tedreply (See Appendix J- in, which - it was stated that,in view *f the resignation of the Chairman and sixother Members of the Commission      on the ground thatthe majority of the Commission had resolved to embark upon the examination of a long list of subjects not.. Included in the terms of reference   it would be theduty of the Minister of Agriculture to represent tothe Prime Minister that the Commission.should bebrought to an   end.The Conference agreed to approve the proposeddraft reply, with slight verbal amendments.OOUTROI OF 2.      The Conference had under consideration the1 interim report of the Committee on the Da-Control of food (CP.655) together with a supplementary memo-rauauui by the Chairman of the Committee (C.P.655A).The authority of the Cabinet was required to therecommendations of the Committee relating to certainfoodstuffs :-(i)    Bread Subsidy.      It was explained that the. recommendations of the-Committee-, that the price of the4 lb. loaf should be raised to 1/- would effect a saving to the Exchequer on the Bread Subsidy of over  lOCOOOa day.      It was also.proposed to raise the extraction\of flour from 77$ to 80$ both .on the ground of economy and
and in order to effeci: -* sJJ^jhir&quot;ljirpxo-vei^^jratritive- quality of bread.The Conference agreed, subject to thfc consentof the Prime Minister -(a) ti approve the recommendation of the Committee:-that the price of the 4-lb*,loaf shouldbe raised to l/-, and that^ the extractionof flour should be raisedt-tb 80$ simul-taneously with the rise in prioe, on theground that a higher extraction wouldprovide better bread, that it would effect a saving on the wheat subsidy, and thatthe prevention of the deterioration,, andadulteration of flour is urged In a memorial to the Minister of Health froma large number of Members of ParliamentIncluding the most influential membersof the labour Party and of the medical profession.(b) that the announcement of the two decisions^referred to in (a) above should be made&apos; simultaneously in the House of&apos;Commons so soon as the Chairman of the Wheat,commission had reported to the lord Privy Seal that theannouncement might be made;(o) that the Wheat Commission should have discretion, if they thought fit, to carry/-out the increase in the extraction of flourby stages.(ii) Wheat Prioes.    The Conference had unddr consideration.the following recommendation of the Committee in regardto the ppioe of wheat:-That an announcement should be made to the&apos;farmers on behalf of the Government in thefollowing termsIt Is hoped that before the-Autumn pf 1921the importation and control of the prioeof wheat by the Government will have ceased,and that farmers will secure the benefit ofa free market at world&apos;s prices.So long as whaat is still controlled, and thereby deprived of a free market, the con-,trolled price of homo-grown wheat of soundVmilling quality, harvested in 1921, will bothe average (c.i.f.) price, for the.twelvemonths ending August 31st, 1921, of imported wheat of similar or comparable quality, pro-vided that the price, so paid to the home-grower shall not exceed 100/- per quarterof 504-lbs.
It was stated that farmers would he guaranteeda minimum price for wheat in the Bill promised bythePrime Minister and now under consideration by the ministry of Agriculture.      The present proposals didnot give a minimum but guaranteed that the Governmentwould not so exercise their control of wheat as togive to the farmers less than 100/- per quarter whenthe.^varaKa.marjiet urice of imported wheat, o.i.f.was at or above that figure.    Some such announcement was necessary in order to carry out the policy of theMinistry of Agriculture to increase the arable area in this country, and to prevent a widespread laying down of land to grass, which was already imminent.Some discussion took place as to whether theproposals of the Committee went far enough.    It wassuggested that, Inasmuch as the increased price wouldnot take effect until the harvest of.1921, it would beunjust to those farmers who at considerable sacrificehad grown wheat on their land for the harvest 19 20and who would not receive the benefit of the higher price, while those farmers who did not sow wheat until next winter &quot;rould reap the full benefit.    Emphasis was laid on the fact that farmers who complied with therequirements of the law are now compelled to sell the whole of their wheat at the Government price and topay a higher&apos;price themselves for food-stuffs for theircattle.In reply to the suggestion that farmers ought not to be- robbed of the benefit of a free market, andshould be ia a position to obtain as much for wheatas the farmers in foreign countries, it was pointed outthat a large part of the high prioe paid for foreignwheat was caused by exchange, insurance, and freight,
and that, in many cases, the foreign farmer had received,or was actually receiving, leys per quarter than Britishfarmers.      The justification for -limiting the maximum price to 100/- was that our farmers ought not to been abled to make an advantage out of the world shortage-of wheat, and must expect tc have their profitsrestricted in the same wsy as coal &amp;rid shipping profits.Some discussion took place as to whether itwould not be possible to extend the increased price to the 1920 harvest, but it was pointed out that, on theone hand, 85fo of the wheat was already sown so that noincreased acreage would be obtained.s while, on the otherhand,  if the new price   were to come into operation as early as the Autumn of this year, the result would be to cause the immediate holding up of all grain from the 1919harvest that had not already been threshed.The Conference agreed:-to approve an immediate announcement by the Minister of Agriculture in theterms of the formula recommended bythe Committee.The Conference agreedto approve the following furtherrecommendations of the Committeeon Food Control:(iii) Butter.    That the price of imported butter shouldbe put up at once to not less assistant 3/- per lb.the ration to remain unaltered.(iv) Cheese.    That cheese should be de-controlled.(v) Bigs and Pig Products.   That home-grown pigs and pigproducts should be de-controlled on March 31st.(vi) Meat.    That owing to the administrative difficultiesof d.e-controlling meat in England and. retaining con-troi in.Scotland and Ireland, English home-grown meatshould not be de-controlled.(vii) Ireland. That the Irish Office be requested to carryout the instructions of the Cabinet in respect of de-control.-(a) In relation to tho de-control of pigs andpig products referred to in paragraph (v) above(b) By making effective the de-control of Irishbutter, by March 31st.v . -4- &apos;  .    ,

SUTION- 4e     Tho Ccnf^rencfl had he fore it the following&apos;UBOUB11IPBBBWGB .   documents sWASHINGTON.Report by the British Official Delegateson the First Ihtarnatriojaal labour Conference-held at Washington, D.G. , Ootober-November1919, with, i covering note by Mr. G.N.Barnes.(O.P. 377),Supplementary Report by Mr. G,N,Barnes.(C*?* 595).-Mr. Barnes in his Supplementary Report called attentionto the six Draft Conventions and the six&apos; recommendations adopted at Washington dealing respectively witft:-(.1) Bight Hours Day and 48 Hours Week in industry.8) Unemployment.(3) Employment of Women.4) Employment of Children.5) Certain dangerous prooesses.The Conference agreed!To refer the Report to the Ministry ofLabour, the Home Office and otherDepartments concerned for the preparationof the necessary Draft Bills to giveeffeot to the recommendations of theLabour Conference;   such Draft Bills tobe submitted later to the Cabinet forapproval together with any proposalsfor administrative aotion to giveeffeot to the findings of the LabourConference.\
189CRIMINALS,   (5) With reference to the question of ?-:arcriminals  -raised as a matter of urgency, it was stated that the French were prepared, to delete the names of Hind*nburg, Ludendorff and Bethman-fiollwegfrom their list provided that the British would remove &apos;Tirpitz from theirs.     This placed us in rather a difficult position inasmuch as although the exclusion*f Tirpitz would not mean that we considered unre-restricted U Boat war-fare justifiable, yet it preventedus from pressing for the trial of officers who hadobeyed Tirpitzfs orders.     We should still insist how-ever on the trial of officers who had exceeded their orders by firing on drowning persons etc.     The conference was also informed that the French and the Belgians were making considerable reductions In their lists and wewere making a proportionate reduction in ours - thisstill left us with a substantial number of names.    Itwas the view of the Lord Chanellor that we should not insist on the inclusion of Tirpitz&apos;s name in ourlist.Attention was drawn to the fact that theAdmiralty felt very deeply on this subject and took theview that unrestricted submarine warfare was started byTirpitz In the hspe of brin0ing the war to&apos; an   end.Such warfare was a heinous crime and ought to be punished.      Our own officers would not have carried out such orders had they been issued by the Admiralty.On the other hand it was stated that on thebasis of Tirpitz&apos;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; a good case could be made out that he was not finally responsible for the unrestric-ted U Bi*at warfare inasmuch as the policy was actuallyII
approved by the. German JBmperor before being carried into effect.      In any case the final decision must havebeen taken by the Government of the day.It was suggested that we might inform germany that we considered unrestricted U boat warfare anoutrage against humanity and someone ought to be punished;    a prima facie case had been made out againstTirpitz but If the Germans thought anyone else was more responsible than he was they should inform Us.To this it was objected that the germans would probably reply that the U baat warfare was a legitimate answer to our blockade, and It was significant that the Committee in Berlin which had recently been examining the conduct of the War bad concentratedattention solely on the ineffectiveness of the U boatwarfare and not on its moralityEmphasis was laid on the point of view that by giving up our case against Tirpitz the security efthese Islands might be surrendered as It would mean wehad tacitly accepted that there could be no control &apos;yverU boat warfare in future a suggestion was made that we might cbtain fromthe German Government an admission that they consideredunrestricted U boat warfare and the Lille- transportati onsI1legal*The Conference decidedthat subject to the approval of thePrime Minister the Lord Chancellor wasauthorized., if pressed^ to delete thename of Admiral Tirpitz from the Britishlist of War Criminals.
illmtjB PRESENT 6. The &amp;on en?&amp;nce had. before it a memorandumSITUATION INKI4ANY. by the -General Staff on the present   situation inGermany (CP.652), together with a note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP.671) in regard toone of the suggestions put forward by the GeneralStaff, viz :- that the Allies,   and Great britain in the first instance,  should raise a loan for thesupply of raw material zc Germany.It was points .&apos;:at that no loan couldbe raised for such a purpose ^o/ but that steps must betaken to revlv&amp; German industrial? Iftha present GermanGovernment was to be kept in existence, and it wassuggested that the British representative on -theReparation Commission should be Instructed formally to propose ta the Commission that it should authoriseGermany to seek a credit from neutrals of a limited amount., say  50-^000^000, which would have to be given priority over Reparation claims and Army of occupation costs.While there was general agreement that s*meaction on these lines was necessary,  considerableobjection was felt to anything which would give theappearance&apos; that the British Government wad takingthe initiative in the matter and it was agreed thatany Instructions sent to the British representative should be in the nature of a private letter, not tobe communicated to the Commission.It was suggested that the question could most conveniently be apprsached by pointing out thatthe progpects f*f obtaining reparations from Germany were dependent on immediate steps being taken to restoreGerman industry by the supply *f ravr material and the    tproposal could then be put forward as a means towardssecuring the reparations.
ICUATION OPRUSSIANIGEES.The. Oonjfarenoe^oaonlingly -agreed z -Shat the Chancellor of the Exchequer should send Sir John Bradbury a copy of the Memor-andum by the General Staff and Inform him -that His Majesty&apos;a Government were desirousthat generous use should be made of theprovision for German reconstruction containedin Article 235 of the Peace Treaty.  (See Appen-dix II),7e With reference to Cabinet ii (20), Minute \2),, -^e^Ckxnfer^nce- had before It the Report of the Committee,,convened by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.714)to consider the question of evacuating refugees fromrioutn Russia   and &amp; memorandvun by the Secretary of Statefor War on the shipping required in the Near East (CP.674It was &quot;explained that the proposal to transport the wives and families of Denikin&apos;s officers to the crimea would not afford them adequate security and could not be regarded as a fulfilment of Sir H.Mackinde^s pledge.    The Admiralty Committee recommendedthat a number - estimated at 10,000 - should be transported to Salonika, Cyprus and Egypt and thiswould be a literal fulfilment of the undertaking given.Shipping was available, but the cost would have to beir^^Jbj^h^^Bv^Lt^ ssistancewhich could be secured from the other -Allies.It was pointed out that such assistance wasnot likely to materialise and that whii*. we Couldtransport these unfortunate people out of the dangerzone, we could not-un&amp;ertaJce to mainta^and this should be made clear to them at the outset.The Conference agreed : -To approve the recommendations madeby the Admiralty Committee, subjectto instructions being sent by the FirstLord of the Admiralty to the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean to make clear to the refugees that they could notbe maintained indeflr&amp;kely by the BritishGovernment
NAVY ESTIMATES. 8. vvith reference- to Finance-Committee 20,Minute 1, the Conference had before it a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty on -Navy estimates and. Naval Policy (CP.645).The Conference agreed to the estimatessubmitted by tir. First Lord, on the, understanding that the number of capital ships to he kept in commission would, be reviewed early in the next financial year.2, Whitehall Gardens,.

Draft Reply te Chairman, Royal Commissionon Agriculture^Ministry..^ AgricuJ-turo-&amp;Pi sherleS^4, Whitehall,Place, .S.W. 1.February, 1920.Sir,I beg to acknowledge -receipt of your two letters,of January 29th and 30th, informing me of the resignationsfrom the Royal Commission on Agriculture of yourself (aspllidta Ashley .Chariman) and of the six other members whose names are in,Bi Cautl^y,K.C * * M..P.       the margin, on the general grounds that a majority of theA. Rea.J.H.. Parker.     Commission had resolved to-embark upon the examination of,inker Simmons.[wry overman,   a long list of further subjects -which are not includedin the terms of Reference, and for the consideration ofWhich the composition ef the Commission could not be con-Sidered sufficiently representative or otherwise appropriate-ate.&quot;The first of these subjects, upon the consideration*f which the Commission proposesto embark, is that of&quot;Security of Tenure,&quot; and with regard to this it has announced its intention &quot;to go fully into the matter andto consider it in all its bearings as it affects theAgricultural Industry&quot;.This decision is in effect a refusal to accept theofficial definition of the scope of the Reference which &apos;*as communicated to you,  on the authority of the PrimeMinister, by Sir Arthur Bos caw en in his letter of July27th last.   He therein stated :-&quot;The Government purposely limited the reference in the first instance so as to exclude wider questions, by which I understand ia meant such questions as security of tenure and the nationalisa-&quot;tion of the land, because they wish to have an early
report on the economic question, and for this reasonthey piaced on the Commission no direct repxe-s-enta-tives of land-owners but an equal number of repre-sentatlves of agriculturists and labourers..   It wouldbe manifestly unfair that these question, which pro-foundly affect the interest of land-owners, should beconsidered in the absence of any representation of them.The Government realise that evidence on these subjectscannot be excluded altogether, in so far at least as it may bear bn the economic position of the industry,but they are of opinion that if there is to be the full examination and consideration of these questions itshould be undertaken by a separate Royal Commissionespecially constituted for the purpose.&quot;With regard to the remaining subjects which the Commissiondesires to add to the terms of its Reference, i do not under-estimate their importance but a3 they have nearly all been ex-haustively examined and fully reported upon, very recently, by theAgricultural Reconstruction Committee presided over by LordSelborne, and are already being dealt with under the administrative and legislative programme of the Government,  it does not seem necessary or desirable to trouble the Commission to consider themafresh.In these circumstances,  and in view of the other reasons which,you advance, I have come to the conclusion,  after the most carefuland anxious consideration,  that it will be my duty to r-epres^nt- tothe prime Minister that he should advise His Majesty to release the Commission from its duties, and to bring Its proceedings toa close.At the same time, I desire to express the cordial thanks ofthe Government for the zeal,  care and ability which you, as Chair-man,  and all your fellow commission-era,., have devoted to the con-sideration of the questions dealt with in the Interim Report sub-tmitted on December loth, and to assure you that your joint labourshave contributed most usefully to the solution of a very important and urgent problem.Bali eve me,yours very faithfully,- William peat.
(APPENDIX II)LETTER PROM THE CHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer to SIR J.  BRADBURY.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall,S.W.1.February 26th, 1920.My dear Bradbury,I enclose for your confidential information amemorandum?of the General Staff circulated to the Cabinetby Mr. Churchill and a note x upon it by myself.-    these papers were yesterday considered by the Cabinet.    they thought it undesirable that I should give you any formalinstructions on the subject or that you should raise it with your colleagues on express instructions from your government,.     At the same time they agreed with the view expressed by the General Staff as to the desirability inthe interests of the Allied Governments of maintaining theauthority of the present German Government in preference to the only possible alternatives, and they agreed further in viewing with considerable anxiety the present economic position of Germany and,the stagnation of her industrial life.The provision of article 235 of the Treaty whichcontemplates that Germany shall be allowed out of her firstpayment such supplies of food and raw materials as may beconsidered necessary to enable her to meet her obligationsfqr reparation was inserted in order to provide a remedy for this state of things,,   and they wished me to inform youpersonally that they are quite prepared for and will readilyapprove any arrangements which you and your colleagues onthe Reparation Commission may make for the restorationcf-German industry in pursuance of this article.     they attach great importance to the- resumption of german economic life and production not only on-political groundsbut as being essential to. the ability of Germany to meetthe just claims of the Allies upon her.Yours sincerely,(Sdo) AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.I CP.63$.X    CP.671.John Bradbury, G C B .
