(1)    It was agreed that a Conference of the following ministers should be held on Wednesday, November 19th, 1919,at 12 Hern, to consider certain questions which had arisen in connection with the Electricity Bill:-I The Prime minister the Lord Privy seal the Home secretary the President of the Board of trade the Minister of transport the Attorney General,together withIhe Go&quot;vexniiiOnt whips.(2)    The attention, of the Conference was called to aMemorandum by the Chairman of the Supply and transport committee on the subject of a suggested permanent organisation for meeting strikes  (Paper CP--97),.. The Minister of Trs^ssport said that he desired the guidance of the Cabinet as to whether a nucleus organisation should be kept in being, together with certain equipment and records of volunteers,  for future emergencies,,It was agreed that no final decision could be taken on any question involving expenditure without a preliminary examination of. the measures proposed, and particularly inthe abscame of the Chancellor of tho Exchequer,It was pointed out that there was an essential difference between a Railway or a Miners1 Strike, whichthreatened to paralyse the life of the nation, and an ordinary industrial and sectional strike, as, for example,in the cotton trade,    There wa3 no intention of interfering with the; latter, but only of ooming to the rescue of thecommunity .when confronted with the disasters which would arise under the former.It was generally agreed that some nucleusshould be kept in being, and the&apos;Supplyand Transport Committee was authorised to ,continue, its investigations into thecharacter and extent of&quot; a nualeua organ-isation which it was thought desirable to.preserve, but approval.  of any such organ-isatioa was withheld until the conference had a oonorete scheme before it,&apos; &apos; :\&apos;.:y[v.;.:    - V^v::&apos;--&apos;.v&apos;:&quot; 2he
The Committee was requested to consider:-(a).   How far it was feasible in this countryto follow the example of the UnitedStates of America and proceed byinjunction:fb)    Whether legislation should be proceeded with which would authorise the&apos;Government &apos;in a national emergency to proceed by proclamation-or Order in Council when astrike threatened the life of the community.The aspects of CP. 9V involvingexpenditure were reserved until theChancellor of the Exchequer could be present.(3)    With reference to War Cabinet 635, Minute 8, the-Conference had before them the following documents a Hote by the Secretary of the Cabinet,covering a resolution of the Supply andTransport Committee (Paper CP.-7G):A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forWar,  on the Employment of Troops in IndustrialDisturbances  (Paper CP--111).The Conference approved the proposals for encouraging the formation Of Special Constablesinstead of Citizen Guards, on the lines setforth by the Home Secretary and approved bythe Supply and Transport Committee.Subject.to the qualification that the WarOffice should be responsible for the care of all.armsj explosiveSj  and lethal weaponsgenerally,  the Conference also approved thefollowing measures which the Chief of theImperial General Staff recommended should betaken (Paper G.P.-111):-(a)    That existing military - guards on all warlike stores and factories under the control ofthe Ministry of Munitions and other Govern-,ment Departments be withdrawn and relieved by civil watchmen or similar personnel,(b.) - That, in case of industrial-trouble, all&quot;protection- duties and assistance to thecivil powor be found by the police, as-sisted-where necessary by.such organisa-tions as Special Constables-or Citizen Guards.(c)    That,  in&quot; case of the Army being required as a last.      resource, when the situation may&apos;be getting beyond the control of the civil power, the Ministry of Transport be pre-parod&apos; to provide the mechanical and othertransport necessary for the movement -of thetroops.    An estimate of what would berequired in such a contingency i.s being prepared by the War Office. -With
With reference to recommendation (c) theSecretary of State for Ear undertook-tocommunicate with bhe Mini6try of munitions and other Departments concerned with ,regard to the control of arras&quot; and explosives. P *(4) With reference to War Cabinet 630, Minute 3, theConference had before thorn a telegram which had been receivedfrom-Mr. Barnos on the question of the number of hours in^he working day and working week,  and a reply thereto whichhad been drafted by the Minister of Labour, suggesting thatthere was no objection to&apos;an 8-hours day if six days a weekwore worked;    but if, in order to secure a short Saturday,more hours than 6vwero worked on the other days, the extrahours should not count as overtime.    It was also suggestedthat, the British Government should accept in principle thelimitation of overtime to not noro than 300 hours per annum for the next five years-.    This was intended to meet condi-tlons on the Continent and in the United States, and, in theview of the Minister of Labour, would not seriously handicapthis country, particularly as Shipping and Agriculture were excluded from the Convention,The Conference felt considerable hesitation in approving the proposed limitation of overtime, as thiscountry might suffer therefrom in certain critical industries_-3-   .    .....    - ..... - : ,   inFTBT^fneConclusions &quot;in their *)raft fora recorded the    &apos; &apos;following decision of tho&apos;Conference:-&quot; (a) That the Army be relieved by the General Post Officeof all responsibility for the maintenance of tele-graphs, telephones and other means of communication.It will be impossl-bl-o. for tho War Office to carry out this important duty in any future emergency, owing:to the reduction1of trained personnel in. the technicalunits eoncerned, and to their being composed of alargo proportion of recruits.&quot;This Drafts- decision was challenged by the Minister oiTransport,Whose viow that this recommendation of the 0.1.G-S- had not been accepted by the Conforeirjd met with support Inother quarters..   This part of tho Draft decision, therefore,has been eliminated as well as the following words in the note bolow (&amp;) ^Tho Postmaster General with regard toresponsibility for telegraphs and telephones, and&quot;.   TheMinister of Transport proposes to bring the question of thotransference of responsibility for telegraphs, etc., from the.Fa?-. Of flee to the--General Post Office before an early meetingof the Supply and Transport Committee of the Cabinet whichtho Secretary of State for War- and the Postmaster-general will be invited .to attend. ------
in a time of emergency, and eases were quoted where at thepresent time, in order to aid production, overtime at therate of 500 hours per annum wa? being worked by agreementwith the Trade Unions concerned.The Con erende referred the matter for decision to a Committee composed of:-&apos;$he Minister of Labour,the President of the Board of Trade.TBo Minister of Transport.The Homo Secretary.to be convened by the Ministry of Labour:th&amp; question to be brought again to theCabinet only in the case of disagreement.In thrj meantime, Sir David Shackletonundertook to consult leading employerson tha proposal.plAIIONS        (5)   The Conference had under consideration telegramPi AND No. 411 from Sir Horace ftumbold at Warsaw, reporting that   ; &apos;the Prench Minister at Warsaw, with his concurrence;intended to enter a caveat regarding direct discussions between tha Polos and Sermans- of details of the evacuation by the Germans oi territories to be ceded by thorn to Poland,.The Conference considered that it was undesirablothat the negotiations between the Poles and Germans shouldbe interrupted if they were inclined to be on friendlyterras frith one another, particularly as the Peace Conferenceat Paris had sa&amp;reaay too much to do.It was pointed out that in the event of any arrange^meltt being oomc to which vraa contrary to the Peace Treaty,if would be jpso facto null and void.The Conference agreed;-That the Secretary of State for foreignAffaies should instruct Sir Syre Crowethat, in the opinion of His Majesty^Government, there was no objection tolocal discussions such as those now taking place between the Germans andthe Poles, provided that any agreementarrived at were referred to^thoPeace Conference for approval.rr&amp;r
ffiURE OFgpRBHEGbPOMIGWHO II.-THE     .   (6) The Conference had under&apos; consideration the following documents:- -A llote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.,covering a Memorandum by Sir John Bradbury(Pp.per CP.110 and CP.-110A), proposing that the Supreme Economic Council shouldbe brought to an end-:A Memorandum, by Mr, Wise, the British Repre-sentative on the Permanent Committee ofthe Supreme Economic Council (Paper CP.-1.35);A Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (paper cp.-40)  covering a Memorandum by Mr. Wise,suggesting the formation of a Cabinet Com-mitteeon Economic Questions arising .$ut ofthe discussions of the Supreme EconomicCounciloThe Conference felt great difficulty&apos;in discussing the question in the absence of the Chancellor of the exchequer-uer through indisposition, &apos; &quot; The-matter,, hiwever, was repre-sented as one i-f great Urgency,&quot; A meeting of the supreme economic Council was to take place in Rtme in three daysTtime., and it was known that the&apos; French Government would, thenraise a number of resolutions as to the form of international co--operation in economic matters both now and after theLeague of Rations had started.    The prench had not formulatedtheir proposals with precision, but the Conference were giventc understand that the suggestions made at the end of Mr.Wis&amp;&apos;ks Memorandum (Paper CPs-lSS) were in accordance withtheir views.    They desired to keep some kind of machinery inexistence until the League of Nations were able to assumecontrol.    The Supreme Economic Council was a purely inter-allied body, and under the.League of Nations it would benecessary to provide representation&quot; for various neutral StatesMr, Wise.Ts proposal was- th;;1 - the - -permanent officials of theSupreme Economic Council should&apos;work out a scheme in con-junction, with the Secretariat of the League of Nations, theSupreme Economic Council continuing in the meanwhile.    It was essential that the British-delegates, who were leaving london on the following morning, should receive instructions as tothe attitude they were to adopt on these questions.
Very strong views were expressed in favour of the.suppression of the Supreme Economic Council,.     While it.was recognised that the Council was. if advantage to Continentalnations,, it was pointed out that Experience had proved that:.,it was of little advantage, and frequently a matter of em-barscassment, to the British Government.     The American andBritish Governments were the only ones that had anything togive, and they had constantly been exposed to pressure, ff&amp;m.Continental Governments to give more.     Sometimes, as, forexamples at the recent Brussels Conference, the criticismdirected against the British Government had been positivelyoffensive.   The representatives of the American Governmenthad actually, ceased to attend the j&amp;&amp;^t&amp;jigr$. of. the. Council,although there had been no formal Butice cf withdrawal.     The3ritish representatives were placed in an awkward positionowing to the difficulty of reconciling the divergent functions between, on the one hand, doing all that was possible toassist British trade, and, on the other hand, placing Britishresources, through the Supreme Economic Council, at the.disposal of our Allies.   An illustration of this wa3 given,in the case of coal.   The coal trade was a most important item in our balance of trade, and high prices could be obtainedfrom Neutrals,    France and Italy had, by arrangement, beengiven the benefit of lower rates, but the drench objectedeven to pay this reduced price, although they themselves wereselling coal to Italy at far higher prices.   Moreover, they refused to limit the price to the consumer, as was done inthis country.   The result of the high prices we had been gettingfor expert, coal was that British industry had been subsidised tothe amount of 3s.4d. per ton.On the other hand, it was pointed out, that, even if theSupreme Economic Council itself wa3 abolished, some *f the subordinate executive bodies would have to be retained.This applied more particularly to the great purchasing organ-isations that had been.formed all ever the world for the
purpose of &quot;buying meat, wheat, sugar and other commodities,and which were, of great assistance in preventing the rise of prices by international competition.      It was difficult,however,  t? isolate these bodies,  since the purchase of foodwas inseparably connected with its transportation.     Sir john bradbury&quot;s proposal, which involved dividing up the functionsof these subordinate executive bodies, was criticised onthe ground that it would-not be practicable to place purchase in the hands of one body and shipment and,distribution inthe hands cf another.      It was pointed out that Lord robert cecil, and other persons who were interested In the Leagueof Nations, would be very disturbed if any step were taken,without consulting them, to abolish the Supreme economic council before the League Of Nations had taken over its work.It was suggested that if the Supreme Economic Council disappointment -appeared there would be no-one to survey the econom.1.0 needs ofthe starving parts of Europe, and it was stated that theSeparations Commission would have neither the experience northe staff to do this.    It was represented that the moment was peculiarly unfavourable for separating the BritishGovernment from the Supreme Economic Council, since thiswould be interpreted as an indication of British policy inthe event of the United States - dropping out of the League.In this latter connection, however,  the Conference felt thatit might not be altogether a disadvantage to let it be knownto some of the Continental nations that they could not take our attitude jtott granted in the matter of assistance.On a review of the above considerations, the Conferencedecided  (a) (That the Minister of Pood, as the principalBritish Representative at the forthcoming meeting of the Supreme Economic Council,without announcing the withdrawal of theBritish Government from the Council, shouldbe careful not to commit us to its prolongation-ticn.    He should state that he had discussed the matter with his colleagues, and had found
that a very strong feeling existedagainst the continuance of the Council,and he should indicate that.the attitudeof the British Government would probablybe largely influenced by that of the &apos;United&apos;States of America.(b)That in the meantime no object would.be gained by discussing the future machineryfor dealing with economic questions either(.1) for the interim period or(ii) when the League of Nations is formed.PJM.        (7) The - Conference had under consideration a Paper by- the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding thecontinuance by Great Britain of a guarantee of the independ-ence and integrity of Belgium (Paper CP--117).The. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that...  negotiations had been proceeding for some time between theBelgian and Dutch Governments for the conclusion cf a Treaty--A of Revision of. the Treaties of 1839, which declared perpetualthe neutrality of Belgium and guaranteed that neutrality against attack.   He thought that those negotiations were now likely to result-in an Agreement, although no Agreement had been reachedso far because Holland was reluctant to enter into an engagementfor giving military protection to Belgium while Belgium was not- satisfied unless she received substantial guarantees.     he believed that the acceptance of the proposals put forward in his memorandum of November loth.  (Paper CP.,-117) would assist theconclusion of an Agreement between Holland and Belgium.     Twokinds of guarantee had been suggested.     The first was larger in scope, and involved the conclusion by the French and british governments of a Treaty&quot;with the Belgian Government guaranteeingBelgium against.-unprovoked attack by-Germany,     This proposal had recently been -put forward by Baron Moncheur, but no encouragementhad
had been given to him.   Baron Moneheur had merely been informedthat Hie Majesty&apos;s Government would be reluctant to enter&apos; ^neemore into engagements similar to those of 1339.     Since thennothing more had been heard of the proposal.     A second pro-rosal, of narrower scope, had now been made by the French Ambas-ambassador.    It was that the United kingdom should enter into an engagement with Prance to guarantee the territorial integrity of Belgium pending the provision of suitable guarantees by theLeague of Nations.   The French Government were of opinion thatit would be advisable to give this temporary guarantee as itwould encourage the Dutch and Belgian Governments to come to terms.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was disposed to &apos;think that it would be well to give this guarantee pendingthe establishment of the League of Nations, provided that theperiod were limited to 3 or 5 years.     The French were willing togive the guarantee without limit of time.     V/hile the Belgianswere anxious to dissolve the arrangements of 1839., they were very anxious about what would happen in the interval before theestablishment of the League of Nations.The Conference considered that, before deciding on anyguarantee&apos;to Belgium,  it would be desirable to. ascertain what&apos;the position was in regard to the Treaty guaranteeing the integrity of France, which had been made dependent on the co-operation of the United States.      It now seemed quite probablethat the United States would not enter into such an engagement,in which case our guarantee of the territorial integrity of Prancemight have to be re-considered.The Conference inclined to the view that we might give aguarantee of&apos; Belgian neutrality with a 5-years&apos; time limit ifthe United States would.join with us in guaranteeing the integrity
of French, territory.     If the United States wou2id not co-operate with us in this, the whole question of our relationswith France and Belgium would have to be re-considered.     some doubt was felt as to whether, if we entered into a guarantee of belgian neutrality for 6 years, we should be able to obtainrelease from it at the end of that period.The Conference decided -Thet the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should instruct Lord Grey by telegram&quot;to ascer-tain the probable attitude of the&quot;united Statestowards the proposed Treaty guaranteeing theterritorial integrity of France,  and that thematter should be brought up again on receiptof Lord Grey&apos;s reply.&quot;&quot;Whit.hall Gardens, S.W.I.November 18th. 1919.
