They heard the views of the Chief of theImperial General Staff and, more briefly, of the Chief ofthe Air Staff.    These are summarised in-Appendices &apos; I. and IIrespectively.Ihe Military        .(8) The Conference at first turned their attention toSituati on atConstantino- the present situation in the area of Constantinople and the%le and theStraits. Straits, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff gaveAction eon-oerted withthe CreekGovernment.the Conference the verbal appreciation of the situation inthis area, which is referred to above.During the meeting, a telegram sent spontaneouslyby General llilne was received, which independently gave thesame estimate as had been given by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff of the immediate reinforcements required inithis area., viz., about one Division.It was clear that the menacing situation in this area could only be adequately and immediately met by the. form cf Greek co-operationemployment of Gree-K- troops, and the^ which the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff preferred was the immediate despatch of one Division to be at General Milne&apos;s disposal for use as he might think best in securing the IsmidPeninsula and the eastern side of the Dardanelles.The Conference had the advantage of discussing thisquestion with M. Venizelos, the Greek President of theCouncil, whose views are summarised in Appendix III.As a result of this discussion the following action.was concerted.-(a) M. Venizelos undertook to send instruc-tions for all preliminary arrangements to be made for the concentration, onthe receipt of further orders froiwhiw, atDedeagatch, of one of the Greek Divi-sions in Western Thrace, with a viewto its being placed at the disposal ofGeneral Milnet-1-

Ru^uerLa^(7) The Conference then passed to the- di^oue-sion ofirr^rHJah noXioy in other parts of the Middle East, and theChief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of theAir Staff gave an expression of their views, which, areincluded in Annandix II.The Seoretary of State for War and the Chief of theImperial General Staff placed on record their view that themilitary forces at the disposal of Great Britain were insufficient to meet the requirements of the policies nowbeing pursued in the various theatres.   An immediatecurtailment of British responsibilities was indispensableif grave risk of disaster was not to be incur re 1. Shouldthe Cabinet decide to continue the attempt to maintainsimultaneously our existing commitments at Constantinople,Palestine, Mesopotamia and Persia, the possibility ofdisaster occurring in any or all of these theatres must be faced, and the likelihood of this will increase every day.After an exhaustive discussion of the military andpolitical situations in Mesopotamia and Persia, the Confer-ence, without reaching final conclusions, agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State for india should ask Sir Percy Cox to return homeas soon as possible:(b) That the Secretary of State for india should be empowered to authorise theannouncement already suggested ,(Paper- CP.-1475, p.2) (See Appendix IV).subject to the agreement of Sir percy cox;    all reference to the League ofTTations being omitted:(o) That further decisions in regard to persia and Mesopotamia, and in regard to the related financial, military and airquestions, should be postponed.The Secretary of State for War obtained the Prime Minister&apos;o authority to forward to the Secretary a list of the decisionsurgently required from a military pointof view.

APPENDIX I.STATEMENT BY THE CHIEF (F   THE IMPERIALGENERAL STAFF.   .The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that.from the telegrams which had been received it would appearthat the Turkish Nationalist Army was attacking the british position&apos;   on the Ismid-  Peninsula-     This position *  was35of an extent of /  miles and the- &quot;battalions which wereavailable there were very weak in numbers.   It was true thatthe Nationalist Army was composed of irregular troops who -were not formidable as compared with the British and german troops who had been fighting 4fi.tthe late war, but there was great difficulty in preventing the emissaries from the opposing  -forces slipping through our lines and upsetting .the population in the rear.   Unless it was possible to re-inforce the British troops holding this line he thought it quite possible they would have to fall back.   If this had to &quot;beGesnUfcilne would probably takn up a line some ten to 15 milesBosphorous the enefrom the     /    which would be shorter than/he was nowholding.   In order to onsure the troops at General Milne&apos;disposal being able te hold on in their present positionhe thought it would be ndcessary to jxdTnforce them with atleast one Division to start with and further reinforce-nents - Woul4*: be necessary later on.   He was very doubtful whether warships could, assist in the operations asthe ground was very broken.   The Turklsh Nationalist army was in occupation of the southern coastline of the Sea ofMarnura and on the southern side of the Dardanelles therewere two British battalions and there was really no reason why these should not be driven into the sea if the forces under Mustapha Kemal chose to attack them.   He felt,, there-fore, very uneasy about this isolated force and would very
much, like to see-it treinf oreed. . On the Galllpoll Peninsulathe Prench had one battalion.   He thought the position ofthis French battalion was fairly secure, as the warshipscould prevent any of the Turkish Nationalist troops fromcrossing the Dardanelles or Sea -of M&amp;rrtpv&amp;.   He was alittle uneasy as to the possible situation which might arise as to the feeding of the population of Constantinople,as he thought it was quite probable t^iat the nationalist forces might stop any supplies from reaching the tpwn bythe Anatc Han Railway,, and, Uais..,might result in s erlousinternal trouble.   General Milne was of opinion thatfor the moment xh- could/deal with the situation^n-in,-,C^^..- .* with the troops at his disposal--bo^th^---wi3^Q^assistance of the Fleet hut ne,-*as decidedly of the opixdsQ-that he    could not with the troops at his disposal o^arryout this work and at the same time ensure the security^ of- the Insmid, Peninsula.;, and the southern side of theDardanelles,and that was why he was asking to be allowedat once to have the battalions from Batoum.    If the Brtitishforces lost the coast of the Ismid&apos;  Peninsula- it was hard to say what the position of Constantinople might be as itwould be possible for the Nationalist forces to shell thetown night and day. - Moreover, the Bosphor       would be closedand it would be more than likely that the population would get out of hand.    If the Turkish Nationalist Army   ere byany chance to seize the Chasiak side of the Dardanelles thesituation would be even still more difficult.   He saw noreason why   Mustapha Kemal should not in a bout six W-geks1time have some 40,000 troops at his disposal.    If he (theCI.G.S.) were in the position of Mustapha Kemal he wouldadvance against Chanak at once.    The whole situation de-pended on what the Commander of the Turkish NationalistArmy decided to do now and he would like to call serious
attention -to the fact that ujxLe-ss&quot; the-t^h^troops In the constantinople -ar-eas at Chanak9ahd on the Ismid5 Peninsula!^)were -strongly reinforced it was quite possible that we might have a disaster.   One battalion had already been or-,dered from Malta to General Milne1s command and one oavalryregiment from Palestine.    There were also two battalionswhioh could be brought from Batoum and possibly two additionalnative battalions could be withdrawn from Palestine.   He wasnot at all sure, however, that these reinforcements wouldbe sufficient and he would not feel easy in his mind unlessreinforcements of one Division could be sent to constantinople and Ismid&apos;  and one or two brigades to reinforce the troops on the southern side of the Dardanelles.   If the Prench and italians, or both, could be got to h-AJg so much the better.He did not think, however^ there was any chance of gettingBrench troops proper as they would not leave Prance.The Greeks had 6 Divisions in the Smyrna area and three *h the maritza.   He was a little doubtful, however, as to whether the greeks were not a little optimistic as to what it was in their power to do.   He had discussed the situation on the previous evening with M. Venizelos and he had asked him if the Greek forces in the Smyrna area were strong enough to advance toPanderma, as such a move would at any rate cover the forcesholding the southern shore of the Dardanelles.   M.&apos; Venlseloshad replied that he could not say, but that he would consult the Greek General Staff .ityAs regards the possibii/of a move from Smyrna tothe Anatolian Railway this would entail a big operation and he doubted if they could carry it out at all and in any case itwould take three to four months as the transport facilities in the country in question were most primitive, an^ it would be
necessary-to form dumps. of ^mmuni tion, foa-d etc. all along the line pf advance.   It had to be borne in mind that 40 or 50 French battalions had just suffered a seriousreverse.    The Turkish troops might not be regarded as formidable-able if compared with the English and German troops fighting in the recent war, but operating in their own rough countryhe would like to say that they were 1$. his opinion difficultopponents to deal with.    If the Greeks contemplated an operation against ^anderma it might he possible to landsome of them there by sea,   He doubted, howver, if theywould be able to withdraw very many troops either from the smyrna area or from those on the Maritza and ansr rei nf orce-ments which they would require to carry out such an opera-tion would, he thought, have to come from Greece.    TheTurkish Nationalist Army were not in possession of any artillerythat could be regarded as really s serious and most of theirguneao&amp;kiars were, he thought, of a light type.   Still, they couldshel*    small steamers passing up the Straits, if they werein possession of the southern approach.He did not thinkthatthere was any/doubt the Greeks could advance to the Chataljastarting from the Maritzaline/; this would take, no doubt, a little time but if it wascarried out it would certdnly be a great help.   He would liketo raise the question of further reinforcements since if a division was moved to Constantinople it would practically mean in his opinion starting another war with Turkey and possiblyRussia later on.   Moreover, It might lead to further fighting in Mesopotamia.    The result of doing this might therefore bevfcc* commit ourselves to a heavy cnarge in the way of sol-diers both for occupying the demilitarized zone In Turkey andslso operations in Mesopotamia and Persia, and might eventuallyrequire a great number of Divisions.   Whether eventually the
the situation which he had   ,n mind would lead or not to a war with Afghanistan he could not say,hut if this did happen at least another 3 to 5 divisions would be required.   What he wanted to explain was that them&amp;re reinforcements we: were to send into the theatre of operations the more the fighting was likely to extend,  andto give a small illustration   he would, like to point outthat 12 months ago one Italian battalion had remained withnowno difficulty at Konia whereas xxxikss 6 British battalionsw re being hard pressed on the Ismid   Peninsula .   His own opinion was that the operations would continue for several years and although it would be a^great help to get the Greeksto come to our assistance now he did not think that such a move would really solve the problem.   He thought palestine was undoubtedly the best place from which to draw on forBritish r einf ore ements at the moment.   He thought that it wouldbe safe to use the Indian troops who were serving in Palestine.As regards Mesopotamia he did not think that it wouldbe possible to continue holding the area which we at present occupied with the number of troops at our disposali    It wasnot that he. expected ana ctual attack but he foresawthe country r   - getting very unsettled,, the railways would be cut and everyone would have to move about under escorts, andfor these reasons he did not think that with the troops atpresent available it would be possible .to continue to holdMozu and if it was intended to do this reinforcements would benecessary.As regards withdrawing, it was very difficult to .&quot; say what effect any retirement would have as everyone knew what a retirement meant when carried out inf rent of a nativeenemy.   The whole problem really ought to be treated as one.thatHe did not think ^ith the forces at present in Mesopotamia- It would be possible to carry out an offensive operation with
a view to gaining .a success as all the different ttjsa&amp;tion therewere very weak and immobile.     He thought that in order tosecure the territory now held in Mesopotamia at least anotherC&apos;   division would be necessary and this division would have to be a mobile one     If such forces were available it would be possibleroughly ;to handle/the Arabs and Kurds.     There was, however, no-place from which such a division could be obtained except from persia and there &apos;m &amp;roughly a division and a largenumber of motyor w&amp; whi^ft $ould be made  available.     If these forces were transferred to Mesopotamia he thought there would befor the present no difficulty in dealing with the situation/, but that wouldmean leaving^rsia entirelyw     Again, as regards the latter country if we were to remain on there in our present position it would the.be necessary to reinforce/troops already there..    Broadly thesituation was, our forces were too weak in the Constantinoplearea and also too weak in Mesopotamia, and there was roally noplace from which reinforcements could be drawn for Mesopotamiaexcept Persia,,     He did not think that.with the troops at present available it would be possible to hold on in either Mesopotamiaor Persia for another 6 months, even if the situation were onlyviewed from the point of view of the soldiers themselves, ..and from a military point of view his own personal opinion was that all the troops should be withdrawn from Persia and sent to Mesopotamiaa
APPENDIX   II.VIEWS EXPRESSED BY AIR MARSHAL SIR H.M.TRENCHARD,Bart. K.G.B.,D.S.O., Chief of Air staff.AIR MARSHAL SIR H.M.TR3NCHARD said that he viewed with nolittle uneasiness the situation from an Air point of view.   JForexample, if the i-quadron asked for by General Milne was to beprovided, this could only be done by taking more than one Squadronaway from Egypt.   The situation in Egypt appeared rather more quietthan a few months.ago, but he thought that nevetheless the WarOffice would be unwilling to release any Air units from the%yptiangarrison, as these were the minimum considered necessary until thesituation became more defined.    Out of the two Squadrons in mesopotamia and Persia one could only regard about one third of the aeroplanesas being available for operations.   This is due to the fact thatthe oquadroas are split up into small detachments and in keeping aFlight at Basvin, 300 miles from its base, out of the 6 machinesprobably only twe would be available.   The allotment of aeroplanesunder the new organisation was now being carried out, and those for mesopotamia were en their way there now.    Ireland was. asking for moreaeroplane8 at the moment, and it was not possible to find them.Again, there waa the possibility of trouble in India,   The ostab-lishment of the Air i&quot;orce in that place at the present time was onlythe absolute minimum for normal purposes, and in the event of anytrouble arising aerial reinforcements up to five Squadrons might be demanded.   These eould not be found from Egypt, and there were noother Reservea which could be drawn upon.    In order to provide aReserve of Squadrons during the next 12 to 18 months it would benecessary to know at once what additional number of Squadrons was going 1;o be authorised, and it was for this reason that the authori-sation of a minimum Jctoyal Air Force Reserve of five Squadrons hadalready been suggested.   He was of. opinion that the two Plights: now available in Persia should be transferred to Mesopotamia^, as thebest use of them could be made in the latter place, and verylittle use could be made of them in Persfia.
APPENDIX.Ill.VIEI7S EXPRESSED BY I-i. VENIZELOS.11. Venizelos said that a Greek Division could at once be put at the disposal of General Ililne if H*h. Government so desired .     It could be taken from tho troops who were in western Thrace.      In addition to these troops his Governmenthad six divisions in Asia Hinor.     As regards the questionwhich had been asked him by the Secretary of State for war on the previous evening about a possible advance towardsPanderma, he had telegraphed to the Greek General Staff inorder to find out their views.      In doing so he had suggestedstopping the proposed operations in Eastern Thrace and re-infcroing the troops in the Smyrna area from those now inThraoe.     Of course if one Greek Division were now       sentto Constantinople and Chanak this division would not beavailable.       There appeared to him to be two alternatives,the first of which was to send one Greek Division tc reinforceGeneral Milne1s troops in Constantinople and at Ghanak, and atthe same time to consider the possibility of carrying; out asmall operation in the Smyrna area in order to relievepressure elsewhere? and the other was to reinforce the troopsin the Smyrna area with a view to carrying out a big operationtowards Panderma.       Be did not think there was any use in asking his General Staff whether it was possible to send a division to Constantinople and at the same time carry outthe big operation.       He was quite ready to arrange for the division which it was proposed to send to Constantinoplebeing handed over to General Eilne to do what he liked with.If it was agreed that this division should go, orders should
be issued at once in order that they niglrt- -start &quot;their- prey^ar^rtixvrurand that transport should be obtained.      If they could haveBritish aid in o-btaahoing transports it would, mean that thetroops oould get quicker to their destination.     The Greekshad altogether, in organised, units,  gone 130,000 men and of these90,000 were In the Smyrna area and 40,000 in Thrace.     Inaddition there were sone 50,000 or 40,000 in depots.     Anyproposal to mobilise additional troops raised, a big question and in order to take .-\ny measures of this description he wouldxiks have to consult   his country.    He did. not anticipate,however, any difficulty in getting the support of the Greekpeople if it was put to them that it was a question of enforcing the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and especially if it were known that the british Government were behind thorn.      He thoughiin such, circumstances it would he possible to revise an additional4 divisions who would number about 50,000 men, making the totalnumber of men available 330,000He had no information aa towhat guns and. ammunition were in the possession of&quot; the turkish nationalist Army.     He was quite sure that the Greek troops wouldbe able to opera e with succees against the Turks hut in sayingthis he did not contemplate following the enemy up into the mountain regions, and the only danger to Greece was the pro-prolongation of the existing state of affairs with its economicresults.     He thought that in the event of trouble with the bulgarians the Serbians would, adhere to &quot;their&apos; Treaty with greece and give them their moral support, but he doubted if they oouldexpect any support from Serbia in the way of actual men.
