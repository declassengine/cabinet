$-KEEPING       1.     v-&apos;ith reference to the Conclusions of theLETHALPONS. Conference held on February 2nd, 1920, regardingthe safe-keeping of lethal weapons, and the questionof making) such weapons available to loyalists inthe event of an emergency (Conference of February2nd, 1920^ Conclusion 1(2)j, the Conference had underconsideration the Report of General Sir NevilMacready&apos;s Committee which had been appointed togo into the matter (CP. 796).The opinion of the Committee was that should it be necessary to issue arms to persons unconnected with the forces of the Crown, two alternatives were open, viz:-(1)      That power should be taken to enlistloyalists into the regular Forces for a short termto tide over the  crisis,  in which&apos;case they would be drafted into existing units, or(2)      That the Special Constabulary organisation should be used,  the local Police Authorities with theassistance of the Admiralty and War Office making a&apos;selection from volunteers of those who have been accustomed to the k use of arms.The Committee recommended the second alternativeaIt was explained to the Conference that theorganisation proposed in this.second alternative was founded on the organisation of the Special Constabulary,but that it would be impossible to use the men now serving in that Constabulary.    The underlying intention was, that If it:was impossible to enlist men for ashort period in the army, men who had been used to carrying firms should be sworn in as. Special Constablesand when sworn in should be armed.    It was also stated the existing organisation of tho Special  .
IIJ212..   f.    ::a-mai^bulaa*y^Tm^ the aount2*y^an&amp;efforts were being made to enlist ex-service-men as far-as-possible.   Lists of these men could be made and kept ready for reference in case it became necessary to arm the men.Attention was also drawn to the fact that the War office were taking steps to give effect to the recommendations madein the concluding paragraph of the Report by General SirNevil IIacready&apos;s Committee (CP,796), that 1,000 stand ofarms should be held, at each regimental depot, together withan adequate amount of small arm ammunition.The Conference accordingly agreed:-(1)     To approve the second recommendation madeby General Sir Nevil Macready&apos;s Committee,viz. that should it be necessary   to issuearms to persons unconnected with the Forces ofthe Crown, the organisation of the SpeoialConstabulary should be made use of&apos; for this-purpose;(2)&apos;      (3)&apos;It -iras- -explained--to- &quot;the^on^rvrence- tha-g^he Bil Ygave powers to the Minister of Transport to make an Order(on the recommendation of an Advisory Committee) revising the powers of charging authorised by Orders under the StatutoryUndertakings (Temporary Increase of Charges)Act, 1918, in thecase of certain Tramway Undertakings, if at any time it appeared that owing to changes in the cost of labour, or material, orother
other oireurnstance-s, the- - exi^f;i.ng^-ch^ir-ge^.^er^or were excessive.     The Advisory Committee in making theirreoo.mrnendat.ions to the minister of Transport would have toconsider the cost of Labour,  and the danger was that if theStatutory maximum were removed, the only restriction on thedeaands put up jointly by masters and men would be abolished,,as the masters and men would agree    to high wages, knowingvery well that the Ministry of Transport could be forced, toraise the charges of Tramways Undertakings in order to pay for those wages.     The particular point at issue was whethera clause should be inserted in the Bill under discussion,stating that in determining the costs of labour for thepurposes of the Bill, a certificate from the Ministry oflabour as to the rates of wages payable, should be conclu-sive evidence.     It was Important that some such clause,should be inserted in the present Bill- in order to make itclear that the Ministry of Labour and not the xiinistry ofTransport were responsible for fixing the rates of wages.It. was explained to the Conference that the Ministryof Labour were unwilling to be placed in a position whichwould make them responsible for the rates of wages, since they had no control in the fixing of the rates, but couldonly certify what were the amounts fixed by the industrial councils as appropriate rates.Some discussion ensued as to the -danger arising fromthe absence of any incentive to masters and. men to keepwages down,  and fears were expressed, that the masters and.men would more and more tend to unite at the expense of thapublic,  although it was realised that in the case of manyundertakings, the eoonoiiio limit had already been reached.The/&apos;
The Conference agreed:-(1)    That it should he made clear that theMinistry of Transport were not responsi-ble for the actual rates of wages which necessitated increased charges In thecase of any particular Undertaking, andthat with this object a clause should beInserted in the Bill stating that theevidence which the Advisory Committeewould consider as to actual rates of.wages should be furnished by the Ministryof Labour;(2)    That the actual wording of the clauseshould be settled by agreement betweenthe Minister of Transport and the Ministerof Labour.OBSERV- 3,      The Conference had under consideration a memorandumICE DAY. by the Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies(C.P.857)regarding a suggestion made by the New Zealand Government,that an Imperial holiday should be set aside annuallyin celebration of Victory and the conclusion of Peace.The Conference were reminded that when this question had been discussed before (Conference of February 3rd,1920, Minute 2) the general feeling had been that theclaim of Empire Day was less strong than that ofthe Anniversary of the Armistice..The Conference accordingly agreed:-That the Acting Secretary of.State for the Colonies should beauthorised to inform the NewZealand Government that in theopinion of His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentNovember 11th would be the mostsuitable date for the commemorationof Victory and Peace, and that theother Dominion Governments werebeing consulted in the matter.It should, however, be ma.de clear in any communication to the DominionGovernments that this opinion didnot bind His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto the institution of an annualstatutory holiday on Armistice day,
i IMPORTED       the Conference had under consideration the following documents:-Memo: by the -President, Board of Trade,(CP. 893)Memo: by Mr. McCurdy,&apos;   (CP. 838)MemO: by the Shipping Controller,-   (CP. 881)Memo: by the Minister ,of Transport,.   (CP. 935). Memo: by the Minister of Agriculture- and &quot;Fisheries,(CP. 936),from which it appeared that the Minister of Shippingdesired to press the proposal that in order to remove the congestion of meat stocks In the docks, the killingof home-grown meat should he stopped for a fortnightto a month, or some other definite action taken toremove the congestion.The Ministry of Agriculture strongly demurred tothe former proposal.It was explained to the Conference that the HomeAffairs Committee had decided.on March 9th that &quot;theDepartments concerned should take all possible stepsto divert cargoes of imported meat, especially fromthe Plate, should consider the possibility of disposing of surplus supplies of imported Mutton to central europe, and should consult the Butchers1 association on the best means of disposing of accumulated stocks.These matters were still under consideration.The Home Affairs Commit toe had not&apos;been in aposition to deal finally with, the matter in the absenceof further information, but it had appeared to themthat no real effort had been made to see .whether themutton- could be disposed of in Central Europe.On the other hand it was stated that suppliesof mutton had been sent to Germany on private account,;0flGESTION OP.    4*      with reference to Home Affairs Committee 51 (1),illMEATS.
&apos; ..... 218wHAeh were still lying in Hamburg asmitlng sale, andthe German Government appeared unwilling to take them up.    It was, moreover, impossible, owing to the dis-locatlon of transport conditions in Germany, to conveyany considerable quantity of meat through Germany toAustria4 and it would be in any event impossible to dispose of meat to the Continent except on liberalcredit terms.Evidence was adduced to show that the GermanGovernment were aware that there was a serious congestion of meat stocks in this country, and were deliberatelywaiting in the hope that ultimately we should be compelledto give the meat away.On the other hand,  it was stated that 20,000tons of bacon was at present occupying cold storage,and should be put Into consumption at once so as tomake room for frozen meat.On .behalf of the Ministry of Food, &quot;it. was statedthat a large part of this was of inferior quality.,    Itwas proposed to dispose of it to Germany if the sanction of the Cabinet could be obtained for sale on credit,.    Theamount of good bacon In storage was decreasing, and bythe end of April there would be only two or three weeks1supply available *The Conference agreed:- \ ..,(1)    that it could not authorise a temporarystoppage of the killing of home-grown meatj(2)    that tho Minister,of Pensions be requestedto-examine&apos;the question in consultationwith the Departments concerned, andto recommend to the Cabinet vdiat steps should be taken to dispose&apos; of the siirplusof bacon and mutton.     -   -The Conference had under consideration a memorandumby the Ministry of Transport (CP.904) in which it was stated that the Storage Committee(composed of representa-&quot;tives of the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Board of Trade,Ministry of Food, Ministry of Munitions, Office of vrorka,Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Transport and War Office),recommended that transit or warehouse accommodation
belonging to railway,, dock or canal.undertakings at&apos;present held by Government Departments,  should be surrendered not later than the end of June unlessfurther occupation is agreed to by the owners of theundertaking, or, failing such agreement unless the storage Committee are satisfied after consideringall the circumstances of the case, that the extension ofthe period of poasessiozi is necessary or desirable in the national interest, and that no alternativeGovernment accommodation is available,      In reply tothe suggestion that it would be necessary to hearrepresentatives of the War Office and the Admiralty,who were not present, it was pointed out that as all government Departments were represented on the StorageCommittee, the interests of those Departments would be safeguarded.It was stated that although eleven months had elapsed since the signing of the Armistice, the Govern-ment were still occupying one and a half million square feet of covered, commercial storage accommodationbelonging to transport undertakings,  and approximatelythree and a half millions of uncovered storage.     the congestion of warehouses and docks arose directly outof the vis,x, and some decision was urgently neoessaryto put an end to it.7The Conference agreed:-That Transit or Warehouse accommodationbelonging to Railway, Dock or Canal under-takings, which is held by Government Depart-ments under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisi-tion of Land) Act,&apos;1916, -must be surrendered-not later than the end of June, unless furtheroccupation is agreed to by the Owners of theundertaking, or, failing such agreement, the storage Committee are satisfied, after con-sidering all the circumstances of the oase,that an extension of the period of possessionis necessary or desirable in the national interest and that no alternative Governmentaoooiamodation is available.
