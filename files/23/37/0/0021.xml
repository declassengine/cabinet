COAL INDUSTRY.

(1) The Conference met in order to continue the discussion of the Coal Industry which took place at their meeting at 11-30 in the morning.

The Prime Minister stated that since that meeting he and the Lord Privy Seal had had an interview with three of the leading mine-owners, namely, Lord Gainford, Sir Adam Nimme and Mr. Evan Williams. As a result of the discussion it transpired that the mine-owners would consent to the following proposals, viz:-

(1) As long as abnormal conditions continue the Government shall be equipped with the necessary statutory powers --

(a) to equalise profits in the coal industry:

(b) to restrict prices of coal for the home market.

(2) That, in the arrangements for the computation of profit, adequate inducements should be afforded to economical production and development:

(3) In order to secure co-operation between owners and workmen in the working of the mines, same machinery should be set up for joint consultation, and it is desirable that a special Department of Mines should be created.

The mine-owners emphasized very strongly their desire that action by the Government should not be exercised directly, but by means of an organisation representatives of owners, miners and the general public, save in two special contingencies: (1) during the purely provisional period until the organisation is set up; and (ii) in the event of failure of the parties concerned to come to an agreement.

The adoption of the above proposals would involve a clear statement by the Government that the goal to be attained was de-control. That condition was regarded as one of complete health, and the Government powers should only be exercised in abnormal conditions. The Bill, therefore, to be introduced by the Government should, in the opinion of the


mine-owners, not be a temporary measure designed to meet aparticular set *f abnormal conditions, but should be apermanent measure operating when abnormal conditions arose,and in normal times should remain dormant.   The decision asto when the measure should operate should jsenain with theGovernment.General agreement was expressed that the proposals ofthe mine-owsuars famed a good starting-point for discussion and were a real alternative to the pelicy suggested at theearlier Conference, which involved a confession that theGovernment had no definite policy in regard to the coalIndustry.    It should be maintained that the Government werenot interfering with individual enterprise, but that theywere entitled to intervene if conditions were abnormal.The Conference agreedThat the proposals of the mine-owners, as outlined by the prime Minister, formed areasonable basis for further negotiation with the raine-awners and mlners*^he* $tteetion whether the proposed department &amp;f mines should: remain with the Board of Trade *r not was reservedfor .further consideration.(&amp;)   ThS&apos;*p&apos;rime Mini a tor again referred to the Deputationwhich he was receiving the following day from the Miners^Federation, and to the points &quot;which the Deputation proposedto raise (Appendix)....As regards paragraph lti the conference agreedThat a sufficient reply to this point wouldbe to say that the *Nvernment are introducing a Bill to deal with the situation the momentparliament re-aeeembles.As regards paragraph 2   the Conference agreed thatthe reply should be :-That at present industrial coal is being sold at a price which involves a less of8d, a ton, without taking into coneidera-tion the profits to be paid to the owners.As regards paragraph 3, the Conference agreed : -(a) That the Prime Minister should take the line that there is no failure to provide suppliesef domestic coal.
(b) That the President of the Board of Trade shouldfur :i is a a detailed - case to the Prime 2 inister.As regards paragraph 4 the Conference agreed that the reply should be :- -Tnat the Government were fully alive to thepffeCt of the high price of coel on the costof living,   and were deeply concerned by it.Considerable discussion took place in regard to paragraph5,    viz., the demand that there should be an immediatereduction in the price -of industrial coal,  followed by Govern-ment action to reduce the cost of commodities produced in factories.    It was pointed out that the discussion that morning had shown that, in the period from April 1 to August31, 192o, there Would probably he a profit ef some  11,000,000resulting from the werking of the coal industry.   The alterna-tives were      te transfer this profit te the Exchequer; togive it to&apos; the miners in the form of increased wages; tegive it to the foreigner by reducing the price of exportedcoal; or, finally, to reduce the coat of household andindustrial ceal.   In favour of the first alternative it waspointed out that if the cost of living rose five pointsthere would be a rise in railway wages and4n the wages ofother industries.   This   arise would result in an irresistibledemand from the colliers for a rise in their wages.   Thebeat course would be, therefore,  to accept the profits andto use them for the- purpose of reducing the cost of livingi.e., by using them .to maintain the subsidies for wheat andether foodstuffa.   The objections to using the anticipatedprofits of  11,000.000 to increase the wages of miners were that the miners had already set the pace in the increaseof wages, and other trades had net reached their level.&apos; Afurther rise in miners&apos; wages would initiate a new cycle of wage   increases,    it was quite pe-impossible, moreover, that, long before the profits in question were realised, the miners&apos;case for an increase in wages would have become unanswerable,owing to an increase in the cost of living, ana the profitswould,  therefore, never actually materialise.- 3 -
It was aXsjs efi$sider$d undeeireble tw b&amp;rtite anyprofit which might accrue from the coalHtnijcijcg,jjrio^tJ?y tothe reduction of the price of exported coal.   Th.e posi-tJon&quot;&quot;-was that the prioe of home coal was at an artificial ly low level and the price of exported coal was the economic- price,The resulting high prioes for exported eoal-were due to theinteraction of supply and demand.   France,, Italy, and other foreign countries, had no right to claim that British coal should he sold abroad at a price below the market prioe.Xt would also be undesirable to earmark the anticipatedprofit for the purpose of reducing the home price of ooalstill further, and it should be maintained that the contentionin paragraph 5 of the memorandum by the Miners&apos; Federation(see Appendix) had already been met by th^aotion of theGovernment in dropylng the jrloe *  household coal t o an uneconomic level.It was pointed out that the French were selling coal to the Italians at far higher prices than were obtained ^yBritish coal exported to Italy, and it was very important,moreover, that as much British ooal as possible should be sold abroad at a high     prioe for the purpose of maintainingExchanges.     The present policy did not involve a-iy hardship to British manufacturers, as exports were only allowed whenindustries had been fully supplied.The Confer ehc e       : c 3 &apos;&quot; - -(1)   That the reply to the question raised in paragraph 5 ef the memorandum by theMiners&apos; Federation (see appendix) should-      be: -That the question does not arise inany oaae until April 1, that it isi impossible to forecast with any accuracywhat the profits (if any) on the coalindustry will be, and that the Govern-ment have already adopted the principleoutlined in the paragraph by sellingindustrial and household coal at an uneconomic price.
r0posedinistryf lines.(ii)    That it was undesirable to allocate inadvance the possible profit of  11,000,000on the working of the coal industry between april 1 and August 31, 1320&apos;(3)     2he Conference had under further consideration a Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade (paper c.P. 307) suggesting the establishment of a Ministry of mines.The Conference decidedThat the matter waS one which should beleft for. further consideration.stocks. (4)     The President of the Board of Traie informed the Conference that stocks of coal were dangerously low atthe present time and that any cessation of output would create a crisis.    In order to bring reserve stocks of coalup to four weeks&apos; supply by March 31, it would be necessaryfor 600,000 tons of extra tonnage, to be provided.   Thiswould involve the allocation of 2$ vessels to the carriage of coastwise coal, and the provision of 4C0 Coal trains aweek extra.    It was very important, therefore, that in discussions with the coal-miners any question of a strikeshould be avoided.   Efforts were being made, with the co-operation of the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry ofTransport, to provide the necessary tonnage for increasingstocks.The Conference took note of the above statement made.by the President of the Board of Trade, and agreed that the matter should be gone into furtherby the Board of Trade, the Ministry cf shipping and the Ministry of Transport.The attention of the Conference was drawn toetura of ( 5)al Wagonsoa Praribe. the fact that the coal problem arose very largely from the.inadequacy of transport,. which, it was contended, could belessened to some extent by a speedier return of railway wagons and engines from Prance..The Conference decided:-That the Secretary of State for War should boasked to go into the question of the return ofrailway wagons and engines from Prance, and tocommunicate the result of his investigations tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Transport.ht^11 Gardens,S.Wary 27,1920.
