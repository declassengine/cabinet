(1);   With reference   to Minfcte 3 of a previous Conferenceheld cn January 27, at 11.30 a.m., the Conference had beforethem the following documents relating to food control andthe estimates of the Ministry of Pood (1920-21)j-A Memorandum by the Pood controller(paper C.P. 457).A Report of the &quot;Bread subsidy Committee(paper CP.- 480),. A Memorandum on the &quot;Financial-Effect of the&quot;Transactions of the Miniwtry of Pood - .-:(paper   0.P 146). - --.After a preliminary discussion on all aspects of thede-control of bacon-, cheese,.&apos;butter and-other foodstuffs, aswell as on the wheat subsidythe Conference agreedThat a cabinet Committee, composed as followsThe President of the Board of Education(in the Chair).The Chancellor of the Exchequer,       -   -The-Minister of pood, &apos;:The president of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour,the S&apos;eeretar.yr-.f o.r, Shetland,-,,,      , .  ,The Minister of Agriculture,-The Minister of Shipping,&quot;The Chancellor ef the Duchy of Lancaster,- - Mr. P, tricks (Secretary).should meet to examine the whole question of.   the future of Pood Control and of the Bread, Subsidy,.and with de-control as the ultimate-&quot;aim, to make recommendations to the Cabinet.(2) The Conference had under consideration a resolution passed by the Empire Movement Committee advocating the annualreligious observance of Empire Day, May 24th, and eugges-ting that the day should be recognised as a Day of Thanka-giving, when people in all parts of the pmpire should holdpublic religious services in- accordance with their respeo-tive faiths (paper CP, 293).It was generally agreed       &apos;&quot;That such religious observance of a nationalImperial character should only be adoptedwith the greatest caution, and that, even ifany such extension were durable, the claim of Empire pay was less strong than, forexample, the anniversary of the Armistice,November 11th.
$TANTINOPLE. (3)   The Conference had before them a copy of a telegram- ****Position from General Milne, Constantinople, to the War Office, datedgeneralIne. January 29th, 1920 (Paper CP.-538).It was explained that the present situation was the culmination of a line cf conduct which had been consistentlyadopted t$ Franchet d&apos;Esperey, designed to place thelatter in control of Constantinople *   The French General^latest move was to withdrew two or three more French B&quot;ttal-Ions from General Milne&apos;s Commands his object being to dimln-ish the forces under the British Commander, so ttwt, in theevent of a serious outbreak, General Milne would not be ableto act direct and he would have to appeal to General franchet d&apos;Esperey to save the situation.It was suggested that a simple way to counteract themanoeuvre was for General Milne to Inform the French Commanderthat he had no objection to these Battalions being token awayso long as due notice v?--*s given, in order that British orIndian Battalions might be brought in to replace them.    Inthe meantime, our Foreign Office might make the strongestrepresentations to the French Government regarding the atti-ffete;It was subsequently reported that the actual numberof rifles stolen.was 8,600 with 30 machine guns ana800**S0 rbunds.

It was suggest-ed that this occurrence afforded an admirable basis for the representations of our Foreign Office to the Clual d*0rsay.It was agreedThat whoever was responsible for thesecurity of the above arms was guilty of culpable negligence and ought to be moved from his Command; but that itws-s essential, before our Foreign Officemoved in the matter, that the War office should fix definitely the responsibility;and that, if it were found that the reepon-slbillty attached to General franchet d&apos;Esperey, the French Government shouldbe pressed strongly for his immediateremoval.It was further agreed
jjjjjTANTINOPLE. (3)   The Conference had before them a copy of a telegram-Position from General Milne, Constantinople, to the War Office, datedp general line. January 29th, 1920 (Paper CP.-538).It eras explained that the present situation was the culmination ef a line cf conduet which had been consistentlyadopted ftgt ^jUMN&amp;i Franchet dfEsperey, designed to place thelatter in control of Constantinople.   The Prench Generalfslatest move was to withdrew tvo or three more Prench Brttal-Ions from General Milne&apos;s Command,, his object being to diminish-ish the forces under the British Commander, so thnt, in theevent of a serious outbreak, General Milne would not be ableto act direct and he t/ould have to appeal to General Pranchetd&apos;Esperey to save the situation.It was suggested that a simple nay to counteract themanoeuvre was for General Milne to inform the Prench Commanderthat he had no objection to these Battalions being taken awayso long as due notice v?-is given, in order that British orIndian Battalions might be brought in to replace them.   Inthe meantime, our Foreign Office might make the strongestrepresentations to the French Government regarding the atti-tude of the French Commander.Attention was drawn to the fact that quite recentlysome 80,000 rifles, with a number of madhine-guns, had beenraided frcm Gallipoli, where they had been under Frenchguards, and smuggled across to the mainland.    It vms suggest-&quot;ed that this occurrence afforded an admirable basis for the representations of our Foreign Office to the 0,ual d&apos;0rsay.It was agreedThat whoever was responsible for thesecurity of the above arms was guilty of culpable negligence and ought to be moved from his Command; but that ItWfrs essential, before our Foreign Officemoved In the matter, that the War office should fix definitely the responsibility;and that, if it were found that the reepon-slblllty attached to General FranchetdfEsperey, the French Government shouldbe pressed strongly for his immediateremoval.It was further agreed
That, in. order tc ore vent similar raids inthe future, the War Office should consult with the Admiralty with a view to thelatter&apos;s co-operation.Ip, In 11 connect ion vri%*i the above discussion it was pointedout that if the Prench Battalions were removed from Constanti-nople they could only be replaced by British or IndianBattalions from Batoura; and that this raised the whole ques-tlon of our evacuation of this port.   The desirability was strongly urged of our withdrawing from Baloum before we were driven out, which might mean a repetition of the French deba^lat Odessa.It was agreed -That the Yt&amp;r Office should be authorisedto take steps to evacuate Batoum whenever they should consider this desirable andopportune.istantinople. It was further agreed  That Constantinople was vital to us, andthat every endeavour must be made to ensurethat we should continue in control of thecity and its environments.I ARCHIBALD     (4)   With reference to War Cabinet 217, Minute 18, the&apos;3PATCH.       Conference had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (Paper CP.-463) regarding the further appllca-tion of General Sir A.J. Murray, formerly Chief OfficerCommander-in-Chief, Egyptian Expeditionary Force, for per-mission to publish in extenso his original despatch from egypt,  dated June 28, 1917,It was explained that when the War Cabinet decided in1917 that the first part of the despatch, dealing with policy,could not be published their decision rested on two grounds : -(a) the one political, viz., that the first portion of thedespatch reflected upon the War Cabinet, and (b) the other military, viz., that other portions of the despatch might give valuable information to the enemy,   xt was represented,that the latter ground no longer exist ed%
It mm pointed out that the Conference had to weighthe disadvantage, en the one hand, of allowing a publicationwith its reflections upon the War Cabinet, with a possibilityof General Murray accusing the Government of deliberatesuppression ef unpalatable facts.     The question also aroseas to whether it was desirable to allow reflections on StatePolicy to be published leng aftor the event without explana-tions;   and that tfas Government wore placed in the dilemmaeither of sitting down under an ex parts (though possibly notvery damaging) statement, or of entering   upon a not verydignified oo&amp;twwerey.It was agreed  $o leave the matter in the hands of thePrime Minister, who undertook, afterreviewing the documents, to communioatehis decision to the Secretary of Statefor War.In order to assist the Prime Minister,the Secretary was instructed to place the relevant War Cabinet decisions laparallel oolumns with the statements InGeneral Murray1s despatch.OP (5)   With reference to War Cabinet 5219 Minute 18, theLS IKI0A1UB*- Conference had under consideration a Note by the SecretaryBE-OH.    of State for War (Paper CP*-427) covering a Memorandum bythe Master-General of the Ordnance asking for a cabinet decision on the use of animals in chemical warfare research the Home Secretary stated thet his Department would consult the Law Officers of the Crown as to whether the useof animals for tha purposes of such experiments was coveredby the Vivisection Act.She general trend of opinion was to support the previous decision of the War Cabinet, that, as no other Power gaveany indication of ceasing the employment of asphyxiatinggases in warfare, the War Office should continue its gasorganisation, without denouncing the Land War Convention andthe Declaration of 1907, so far as this tied our hands inthe matter of gas.
It&apos; was agreedThat no decision should be ta&amp;en untiltho Government ware in possession ofthe considered opinion of the lawOfficers of the Crown on the point raised by the Home Office.2J?hiiehalI Gardens, S.W.I.3rd February, 1920.
