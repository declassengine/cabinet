NEGOTIATIONS WITH M. KRASSIN.

With reference to Cabinet 33(?), Conclusion (?) (?) the Conference met to consider the reply of M. Krassin to the questions which had been put to him at the Conference held on May 31, 1920 (C.P.1421) and to advise the Prime Minister as to the line which should be taken with M. Krassin at a further meeting which was to be held that afternoon.

(a) Release of British subjects in Russia.

The attention of the Conference was drawn to the statement made in para. 1 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply (C.P.1421)Russia that there were a number of Russians in England who, in spite of the agreement made between M. Litvinoff and Mr. 0&apos;Grady, were prevented by the British Government from leaving England.

The Conference were informed that the British Government had decided that every Russian who desired to do so should be allowed to return to Russia. The Soviet Government, however, had refused to take all the Russians in question, but desired to select only a limited number (125 persons). To this the Foreign Office had objected, and had insisted that all Russians who wished to return to Russia should be allowed to do so.

The Conference agreed:-

That the policy hitherto adopted by the British Government should be confirmed, and that M. Krassin should be informed that the British Government had no objection whatever to all Russians who wished to do so returning to Russia.

(b) Anti-British Propaganda.

The Conference took note of the statement made in para. 2 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply (C.P. 1421) regarding Anti-British propaganda, and agreed --

That the guarantee proposed by M. Krassin was sufficiently wide in its terms.

(c) Position of General ? Wrangel.

With reference to para. 6 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply (C.P.1421), some discussion ensued as to the line which should


 should be taken in regard to General Wrangel&apos;s army.

The Conference were informed that General Wrangel&apos;s army in the Crimea was now in good condition, and an important military factor. If General Wrangel were to make an attack it would be because he could not live on the Crimea, and was obliged to advance in order to obtain food for his Forces. It was therefore suggested that the British Government should state that they could not support General Wrangel in a policy of aggression outside the Crimea and that such a policy would have to be undertaken by him on his own responsibility. If, however, General Wrangel would remain quiescent, the British Government would endeavour to come to an arrangement with the Soviet Governments and would in the meanwhile use their best endeavours to furnish foodstuffs to his Forces.

The Conference agreed that in regard to General Wrangel a statement should be made to M. Krassin in the following sense:-

The British Government is willing to mediate between the army of General Wrangel and the Soviet Government with a view to securing effective guarantees for the security of these forces and of the refugees they are protecting. His Majesty&apos;s Government will not support offensive action by the army of General Wrangel outside the limits of the Crimea, and in the event of General Wrangel refusing mediation or refusing to accept what in the opinion of H.M. Government are effective guarantees for their security, H.M. Government will feel freed from all further responsibility on their account. If, on the other hand, the Soviet Government refuse to give what H.M. Government regard as effective guarantees for security in regard to General Wrangel&apos;s forces, and endeavour to attack their place of refuge in the Crimea, H.M. Government will consider themselves free to take any course they think fit.


(d) British Naval Forces in the Baltic, and Black Sea.

The Conference took note of the suggestion in para. 7 of M. Krassin&apos;s note (C.P.1421), that all warships  belonging to Powers not possessing territory bordering the Baltic and the Black Sea, should be withdrawn from those Seas.

It was generally agreed:-

That this request was impossible.

(e) Attitude of the Polish Government.

The opinion was expressed that the Polish Government was desirous of entering upon peace negotiations with the Soviet Government, but were waiting for a remarkable success before doing so. The military position was distinctly favourable at the moment to the Poles, who were also stated to be arranging for the transport of corn supplies from the Ukraine to Central Europe.

The Conference wars generally agreed:-

That it would be impossible for the British Government to make the first suggestion to the Polish Government of peace negotiations with the Soviet Government, since the British Government would in that case be held to have incurred a certain responsibility in the event of any failure of those negotiations.

(f) Minefields in the Baltic.

With reference to Conclusion 1 of the Conference of Ministers held on June 3rd at 5.30 p.m., the Conference were informed that in the opinion of the Admiralty the duty of sweeping-up minefields in the Baltic was one which should be undertaken by Russian and German minesweepers, and in no circumstances by British sailors or vessels. Few of the mines, in the Baltic were British mines.
