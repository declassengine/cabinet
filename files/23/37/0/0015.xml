ERUANT ANDHE RATXFICA-jON OP PEACE,The Conference, which had been-called as a raattejg^rf-urgency to consider the situation in regard t&amp; the r^ttlflca--tion of peacj with Germany, had the followijig^documentsbefore it:-Lord Derby&apos;s very urgent telegram No.1211,dated December 5:Sir Eyre Croweis private telegram ofDecember 5 (11-30 p.m.):A despatch from M.Clemenceau to Baron vonLersner, Chairman of the German Dele-gat ion, Parisp dated November 22, 1919(W.

As soon as the attitude of the UnitedStates of America towards the Peace Treaty had become clear, and It was known that the UnitedStates Plenipotentiaries were about to leaveParis, the German expertsj who had been sentto Paris;to conclude the final arrangements forgiving effect to the Treaty of Peace, had with-drawn to [Berlin.-   Remonstrances had then been addressed to the German Government by the supreme council (W.CP.-1416).On December 1st Baron Von Lersner had.replied by a verbal communication to theSecretary-General of the Peace Confererence,in the course of which he had drawn attentionto the fact that the participation of america had been an Important element in the stipula-tions of the Peace Treaty, and was regarded inthe whole of Germany as an Important guarantee.He had agreed, nevertheless, to give assent to theTreaty, but, as a compensation for this sacrificeon Germany&apos;s part, had asked for a relaxation of the Treaty iniegard to the extradition ofthose accused of breaches of the laws of war,and for certain concessions in regard to the return of prisoners of war.   He had refused to signunconditionally a protocol dated November 1st,which had been sent by the Supreme Council tothe German Delegation, and which contained alist of unfulfilled conditions of the Armistice,which Germany was asked to undertake to carryout as a preliminary to the final exchange ofratifications.   The Items in this protocolwhich Germany declined to agree to were :-(1) The demands presented in consequenceof the sinking of the ships at ScapaPlow:(2)    The reservation of the right by theAllied and Associated Powers to have recourse to all measures of military or other coercion which they mightjudge appropriate in the event ofGermany not fulfilling her obliga-tions within the period mentionedin the protocol0Although Baron von Lersner Js verbalcommunication had been followed by a despatch from the German Government, the latter was reported to be weaker9   Further it was evidentthat.the German Government had not altogethersupported Baron von Lersner and their experts in their action, for they had offered toM. Clemenceau to replace Baron von Lersner,if he was persona ingrata, to which M.Clemenceauhad replied that he was persona Ingratisima.Further, M. Clemenceau had stated that&apos; he hadsecret evidence that the Germans intended to sign if the Allies maintained a firm attitude,and, although the precise nature of thisinforma-tlonms not. disclosed, the American Delegation,who had seen some of the Germans remaining inParis in order to tell them that America was solldlin this question with Great Britain, France, Italyand
and Japan, had formed the same impression,theThese were/circumstances in whichthe Supreme Council had prepared the draft note(Appendix I) which constituted an ultimatum,tnreatenlrig a rupture of the Armistice as a penalty for any further delay by Germany Insigning the Protocol.The Supreme Council was reported to be unanimous, and the urgency of the matter lay inthe fact that the American plenipotentiaries are due to leave Paris on Tuesday and the UnitedStates Government have declined to consent totheir remaining any longer.   Mr, Polk was pre-parrard to sign the. note, but if they did not signbefore Tuesday no American with authority to signwould be left in Paris.The actual question for decision was as toWhether Sir Eyre Crowe should be given authorityto sign this ultimatum*While recognising the urgency of the question andthe Importance of obtaining the signature of the UnitedStated plenipotentiary, and while impressed with the factthat the Supreme Council was unanimous on the subject, theConference felt that the circumstances were not such as tojustify or necessitate an ultimatum involving actual hofiliil*ltles in the event of non-compliance by the Germans.   It waspointed out that the Germans had not made the cancellation of the Article of, the Treaty of Peace in regard to breachesthe laws of war a condition, but had merely suggested thatthis concession shou^u be m?de in order to ease their position^The same applied      their deiAAad in regard to the return of tfcvoir   ffmtnortsvs of war detained in France      a matter inwhich uue Fren.cn had adopted a somewhat harsh attitude.    Inregard to the German refusal to make compensation for theScapa Flow Incident, or to assent to eventual measures ofmilitary coercion, the Conference took note that the supreme council had agreed &quot;to take^ them &quot;into consideration&quot;.   Asregards the former point it/was generally felt that on merits
s7Mr.Polk*s plan, communicated through the American ambassador in London, would have been preferable, namely, to insist on the principle of compensation, and to refer the amount tobe decided on by tho Reparations Commission.    It was further pointed out that the present German Government was a moderateGovernment, believed to have the intention of honesiy giving effect to tho Treaty..    If an ultimatum was presented in theterms riow proposed, the effect might be to bring about itsfall.    If this should occur, its successor would probably be either a Spartac 1st or a military Government, both equallyundesirable.    In any event, if the Germans declined to yield,military action of some kind would be necessary and wouldhave to take the form cither of an advance into Germany orof a blockade    The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had reported from Paris to tho Secretary of State for War thatthe Allied Forces were not.adequate to enforce a strong mlli-tary policy.    Considerable forces would, the Conferencethought, be required, as the Germans, though probably incapa-ble at present of serious offensive operations, -still had more than a million armed and trained men in one formor another available, and might be able to oppose an obstin-ate resistance.    It was felt that re-mobilisation in orderto enforce our policy would be highly unpopular and couldbe %only/justified for very valid reasons.    The re-establishmentof the blockade would be o nly slightly less unpopular.On a review of all the circumstances, the conference agreed on the following action:-(a)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telegraph to Sir Eyre Crowein the sense that gra^e misgivings werefelt as to the form of the final paragraphwhich threatens Germany with a definiterupture of the Armistice.    The British Govern-ment are undertain as to the wisdom ofsuch a threat, and as to the effect thatmay be produced upon the German Government.They suggest the following amended version,which they earnestly trust that all SirEyre Crowe1s colleagues will.be able toacceptj-The Allies must insist, therefore,that thore should be no further delay In the signature of the protocol and the conclusion ofPeace.&quot;

APPENDIX I *DRAFT NOTE TO GERMAN DELEGATION.Proposed by the Supreme CouncilDee&amp;iuber 6,1919.(1) The Supreme. Council has csonside&apos;Qd verbal communication which,you made on behalf of the German Government on December 1,(2)    Notes of November 1 and November.22 have defined responsibilities -ty of Gorman Government for delay of ratification of Treaty and conclusion stated therein holds good.(3)    The suggestion concerning the.alleged right of Germany to demand ( as compensation for the absence of the American delegates from the Goinmissions until the ratification of the Treaty by theUnited States) a modification of the clauses^ of the Treaty dealingwith the surrender of guilty persons and the return of prisonersof war, is not well founded.     According to the final clauses ofthe Treaty, the Treaty is to enter into force as soon as Germany&amp;nd three of the principal Allied and .,s so oi ate 4 Powers shall have ratified itj    it is useless for Germany to attempt to sraake-itsputting into force dependent on a now condition, the presence of american Delegates in the COiamissiona.i\)    It is not oo&quot;&apos; rect to say that the German point of view was accepted in this respoct on October 14.(b)   It is no less incorrect, to state that Eerren von Simson andvon Lersner were: invited ;m the 20th November to oral and writtennegotiations on the subject of the.- Protocol of November 1st:    theywere simply Informed that, haying received a note in, writing, tteGerman Government must&apos; reply in writing to those demands, andthose alone, -which were, formulated, in it. &apos;(6)    The Supreme Council considers that Article  81 of tfce Treatyof Peace (regarding the return, of prisoners of war) iss perfectlyexplicit and. is in no need, of -amplification,&apos; France has.already declared on several occasions that she would liberate the prison-ere as soon as the Treaty was put into force;    there is no rtasosafor her-to repeat it.-again. -(7) The Council can only :;take into consideration the objections. raised to the:demand for. compensation:..for -.tha destruction of the/German fleet at Soap a rlow, and. to&apos; the &apos; fore shadowing of&apos; eviaaim&amp;lmeasures of military coercion described in the Allied note ofNovember 1st.(8),   Before making their demand,  the; Allied ar)d Associated Powersexamined this question.   &apos; They do not :share the fears of fcho GermanGovernment as to the economic effectb which might result therefromfor tha German., porte.They adhere to the Protocol in the form in which it ie drawn- *up*After having received a compiote.ilst of all the floatingdocks, floating cranes, tugs, and dredgers, demanded by the Proto-E.L, the Allied and .;.ssoc iated Powers will make known, their choice,taking into aocount the general economic situations of the german ports.If the German Government then considers it can show that one -of the said demands is of such a nature &amp;p to affect seriouslythe capacity of Germany to satisfy its legitimate needs in respectof the maintenance of its river navigation or other vital economic
1(10interests of the same class, the Germe&apos;-: Government can presentits claims to .the Principal Allied and  Associated Powers, who,on their parts, will he prepared to examine them in a spirit of equity after hearing the views of the.-Reparations, Commission.(y)    As regards the last paragraph of the Protocol of November 1,the Supreme Council hold that the signature of the said Protocol,and the deposit of the ratification, decide the coming intooperation of the Treaty and consequently the. state of Peace. it follows that execxrfcion of the provisions of the Protocol, onwhich the coming into operation df the Treaty of Peaoe is depend-ent, will be guaranteed by the general stipulations of that treaty as well as by application Cf the ordinary rules reoog-nised by the law of nations.Draft proposed by theSuprerne Couno 13!.  &apos; ;(10)    Until the Treaty of Peaoe comes into operation the denunciation-tion of the Armistice suffioes to leave the Allied Armies everylatitude as regards such military measures as they might consider necessary.     If the German Government continues to defer signature of the   Protocol and thereby definitely, to ratify the Treaty, theSupreme Council are determined without further delay to -Germany in face of a rupture of the Armistice with all. the con-sequences which would jb How therefrom.Draft pro po sod by theconference^ .(10)    The Allies must insist, therefore-, that there should be nofurther delay in the signature of the Protocol and the coho usionof Peaoe.
