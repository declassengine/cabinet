Uji cruTrTTVA-       (1) The Oonfwerrxc^. had&apos;und^[ON IN \ ,lng-document s :-Correspondence between the President ofthe Board, of Trade and the Chairman of.  the Home Affairs Committee (Pacer G.T.-8363),A Memorandum by the President of the Boardof Trade (Paper G.T.-7812),A Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Board of Agriculture and Fisheries(Paper G.T.-7926),A Memorandum by the Cr   .f Secretary for ireland (Paper G.T.-7940),Home Affairs Committee 39, Minute 1 and appendix:from which It appeared that the Home Affairs Committee had approved a Government guarantee for five years in respectof a scheme put forward by the Empire Flax-growing Committeefor the encouragement of flax-growing In the South ofIreland, uncler which two Companies might borrow  100,000and  .60,000 respectively.    Of the profits, the Governmentwould in each case, take two-thirds and the Company one-third, and at the end of five years the Companies wouldhave the right to purchase the bv..; lojng^ -v*wi machinery atone half the cost price.    The Treasury had been represented at the meeting, by it subsequently, at th, instance of theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Trea^-wy refused to sanction the proposal, on the ground of principle.It was pointed out by the Chancellor of the exchequer that he had statedin the House of Commons that It was thepolicy of the Government to create no hew subsidies, and he therefore felt it impossible to embark on a scheme of thiskind without direct Cabinet decision.-Some discussion took place as to the operation ofthe guarantee given during the Yvrar to the flax-growers inP.W. the North of Ireland,  in which it was pointed out that theL.B.L.S.
substantial profit to which the Government were entitled under the terms of the guarantee had had to be given upowing to the refusal of the farmers to release their cropsunless the Government relinquished their share of the prfits *   It was suggested that the linen industry and the farmers, in consequence, had made enormous profits, andthat the former could well afford to advance the money for making a new experiment in the South of Ireland.   On theother hand, it was pointed out that Government help had beengiven to trade in v arioue forms since the Armistice; thatit was highly probable that political considerations would interfere to prevent the North from coming to the help ofthe South; that, as It would be impossible for any supplyof flax&apos;      come from Russia for a very long time, any increase in the Irish flax crop would be of benefit to thewhole trade of this country; end that we had for a longtime be en accustomed to give, to the South of Ireland help-in matters of this kind to a far greater extent than to anyother part of the Kingdom.   It was suggested, however, thatthe private promoters of the scheme ought to bear a greatershare of the risk by advancing a much more substantial amount of the money required than was proposed/in thepresent scheme, and that the proposal that they should beable to buy back the machinery and buildings at the end offive years at half-price was inequitable.The Conference decided :-To approve in principle the proposals ofthe President of the Board of Trade fora scheme for the encouragement of flax-growing in the South of Ireland (paper g.T.-7812): the details of the scheme
351 1to be settled, in consultation with *^eTreasury, on the understanding that theprivate promoters concerned should hear amuch more substantial proportion of therisk than had been contemplated. &apos;(2)    The Conference had under consideration a Memorandum&apos;&quot;by the Chief Secretary for Ireland (Paper G.T.-7823) inwhich it was proposed that a Bill should be introduced into parliament in order to carry into effect the provisions ofan unwitnessed codicil to the will of the late Sir hugh lane with regard to certain pictures of the ContinentalSchool which had belonged to him and which were now in theNational Gallery in-London, namely, that these picturesshould be vested in the Dublin Corporation! together witha Memorandum from the Trustees&apos; of the National Gallery(Paper G,T,r8283) which opposed this proposal.In support of the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal, it wascontended - -(a)   &quot;That it was the original intention of Sir hugh lane to leave his Collection to the DublinCorporation, but that, owing to his irritationwith that body.regarding their refusal to conform to his wishes for the erection of a   -Venetian Gallery in Dublin for the housing ofthe pictures, he bequeathed them in 1913 tothe National Gallery in London.    But, hisirritation with the Dublin Corporation beingovercome, he wrote in his own hand, in 1915,-the unwitnessed codicil bequeathing the Col-lection to the City of Dublin, on the under-standing that a suitable building was pro-vided for them within five years of his death:(b).  That there was written evidence of individuals who had seen Sir Hugh Lane just before his death, to whom he made It quite clear thathis intention ?;as to leave the pictures tothe City of Dublin?.(c) That the introduction of -the suggested bill would not create a bad precedent as regardsprivate wills. Inasmuch as this was a publicbenefaction made to the Irish nation:(d) That as the codicil was written in thetestator&apos;s own hand and put in an envelope,sealed and addressed to his sister, who hadcha.rge of the main will, this showed that sir Hugh Lane obviously&quot;thought that thecodici.! f&apos;as valid in law.It was not contended that legally the national gallery of London was not entitled to these pictures, but it
^was pointed cut that, had the codicil been made in Scotlandinstead of in England, it would have been valid in the eyes; of the law.It was stated on the other hand - -(a) That, apart from the uncontested legal claim of the Trustees of the National Gallery tothe pictures, there was very great doubt as toSir Hugh Lane&apos;s intention regarding the future      *of his Collection,.inasmuch as up to the datehe sailed to America he v&amp;s in constant conriuni--cation with the Trustees, of the national gallery regarding the exhibition of his Collecttion at the Tate Gallery*   .Also, that on the24th March, 1915  (six weeks after the codicilwas made) Sir Hugh Lane -lid not mention hischanged intention to .Mr c.McColl,- the Keeperof the Wallace Collection.-   In addition, atthe end of March, 1915, Sir Hugh Lane had a conversation with Mr.Aitken at which the subjectof the destination of the French pictures was definitely raised, and Sir Hugh Lane was told that the prospects for the provision of aGallery In London for the permanent exhibitionof his pictures were good; after which Sir hugh lane stated that he would wait for a result ofthe negotiations and finally decide accordingto the treatment he received from the authorities of London and Dublin respectively.   It wasalso suggested that as Sir Hugh Lane was a man who constantly changed his mind, it was impossibleto ascertain what his real intentions were, andin view of this the only safe ground on which to proceed was the one laid down by law,,(b) That Inasmuch as It was proposed to take away from the Trustees of the National Gallery, byAct of Parliament, what was theirs by law, theNational Gallery was beihg placed in a worse position^that a private individual against whomno-one tw&quot; a moment would propose to proceed ina case of this kind.(o)   Great stress was laid On&apos;the bad effect whichwould be produced If the State set the example of overriding the intentions set forth in alegally attested will in favour of an instrumentnot legally attested.(d)    That outside evidence regarding the testator&apos;intention was acutely divided.One point of view was that this was not a question to be decided on from the purely legal standpoint, and itwas denied that the law represented the real substantialfacts of the case.    In this connection it, was contended thatthe whole of English and   Irish public opinion would be Infavour of carrying out the testator&apos;s desire expressed inthe codicil.
It was suggested that the following might be used asa preamble to the Bill proposed by the Chief Secretary:-&quot;Whereas certain pictures belonging to the lateSir Hugh Lane have been left to the national gallery and now belong to the Trustees of that body who represent the Nation and whereas there seems to be some doubt as to what were the finalviews of Sir Hugh Lane on the destination ofthe Pictures Parliament hereby decides to trans-fer from the Trustees of the National Galleryin London to the Trustees of the MunicipalGallery Jin Dublin the future custody and legalpossession of the said pictures&quot;.It was pointed out, however, that the Trustees ofthe National Gallery, after carefully considering all theevidence both for and against the question whether thecodicil represented the last wishes of Sir Hugh Lane, had come to the conclusion that it was not borne out by thefacts, and that to give effect to such a condicil would, inthe circumstances, defeat and not carry out Sir High Lane&apos;slast wishes:    also, that the Trustees felt it incumbent on them to oppose any steps that^ere taken to make it legal,by Act of Parliament, to transfer        Collection to Dublin.The Conference deccded by a majority  That it was undesirable to take any stepsby Act of Parliament to depart from theintention expressed in the will of Sir hugh lane to leave his Collection of ContinentalPictures to the National Gallery in London.(3) The Conference had under consideration a letter fromMr. Balfour to Lord Curzon, covering a draft of a bl-lateralTreaty between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Greece (PaperP.-136), asking that the Treaty^should be formally approvedby His Majesty1s Government and submitted to the GreekMinister in London for the approval of the Greek Government:and a Note by the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairto the Secretary of the Cabinet (Paper CP.-50) asking whether the Cabinet had any observations to make in regardto the draft Agreement, and reporting that the Board ofTrade had requested that the remaining negotiations inregard to this bi-lateral Treaty and those to be concluded.
