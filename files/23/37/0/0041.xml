Adi-inis- commenced by an examination of the question of Mesopotamia,ion.&quot;where recent telegrams had shown that a difficult situationexists-.    There was general agreement,  in the view reached by the Ministers concerned as the result of a discussion atthe Inter-Departmental Committee on Eastern Affairs,  that sir Percy Cox-, who has left Tehf-ran with a view to taking up a post at the head of the Administration in Mesopotamia,should be instructed, before returning home to consult withthe British Government,  to remain at Baghdad sufficiently long to place himself in possession of all the facts of thesituation bearing on the question of how the policy of developing an Arab Government is to be applied-.    It wasalso agreed that sir Arnold Wilson, notwithstanding his great services,  should be Withdrawn from Mesopotamia.    Itwas suggested that he should be available for consultationwith the British Government at the same time as sir percy cox.nmLITARY It was clear at an early&apos; stage of the discussion that-CTs OF vQUESTION.        the military question must be considered as a whole,.

In tha.  timid&apos; /j^iajja^uli . -andin--the^.region of Constantinople, the situation was serious and,  in order to carry out our existing policy,  reinforce-&apos;resents were either required immediately or likely to berequired in the near future.    It was possible,  also, that circumstances might arise necessitating reinforcements forPalestine and Egypt.    In the present stage &apos; of our militarydevelopment, however, when the V.a.r ^rmy has been completelydemobilised and the poet-war Army is in its infancy, no general reserve exists,  and reinforcements for one theatrecould only be obtained by withdrawing troops from another,It was recognised that our military situation was such thatit would hardly be&apos;possible to avoid asxing Parliament forfurther appropriations, and it was suggested that a warning of this ought to be given&apos; at an early date.The present situation in each of the disturbed theatresin the Middle East,  as set forth in the Papers before theConference, was carefully examined,  and it *&apos;as generally agreed to confer on the subject on the following day withthe Chief of the Imperial General staff and the Chief of theAir  staff.    The most immediately menacing situation was inthe Ismid Peninsula, where some minor fighting has already taken place.In this connection attention was called to the pes si-biiities of co-operation by Greece, and it was stated thatK.Venizelos was prepare! to take such action as might be desired of him without ashing for military or financial support. The Greeks were now in occupation of Western Thraceand were prepared to advance into Eastern Thrace.   -They also had a large force in the Smyrna area.,  and were prepare&quot;!to act against Mustapha-kemal*The question of Greek co-operation gave rise to a dis-.cussion as to the fundamental interests of British policy&apos;in the hear East, and it was suggested that it was to our interest definitely to support the Greeks.
It was generally agreed that, having regard to thevery strong and even dramatic&quot; lino of policy taken by theBritish plenipotentiaries in regard to the Treaty of Peacewith Turkey, to retire from Constantinople before a bandit]*ke MuStapha Eternal would deal a shattering blow to our prestige in the iuast, and that this oould not possibly becontemplated.After some further discussion it was agreed  (a) That the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff and the Chief of the Air staff should be invited to attend a further meeting of the Conference at 11 a.m.on the following day:lb) That the Seoretary of State for War should,before the meeting, ask them to be preparedto express their opinions on the military aspects of a policy under the following heads;-1. Authorise Greeks to advande intoEastern Thrace at onoe.2* Give them manoeuvriiig liberty in the smyrna area, but wahi them againstgetting involved deeply.3. Bring a Greek Divieien to reinforceConstantinople area.4, Evacuate Ba$um and transfer garrisonto Ismid.5. Relnforoe Ismid Peninsula as far as our resources allow, and hold it and constantinople as a British Commandwhile jl) is being carried out.6, Withdraw from Persia forthwith.7e Contract to railheads in Mesopotamia,and develop Air JPorce there, andgradually re-occupy as our strengthgrows and circumstances allow in thenext few years.(e) That on the following day the conference should consider the desirability of sending the following telegram to dir Percy Cox:,rDRAFT OF TELEGRAM PROM SECRETARY OP STATEFOR INDIA,  TO CIVIL COMMISSIONER, MESOPOT-AMIAvA1MIS*   My telegram of 16th June.    Pleaseconvey follov/ing message to Sir P. Cox.Bej^nsu   His Majesty&apos;s Government are moetanxious to have your advice on presentsituation in Mesopotamia^     They do not
accept Wilson&apos;s view that true alternativelies.between extension of control as defined in his telegram 1^0.6948 and withdrawal toBasra.    They are irrevocably committed to policy ot creating an effective .irab Statehot a cRmouflaged British protectorate andthey regard practical alternatives as beingeither to set to work at once on lines theyhave already indicated or completely to evacuate Mesopotamia.   Preliminary stepsproposed for carrying out policy of HisMajesty rs Government were indicated in mythree telegrams to Wilson of 9th June which you have doubtless seen.    She suggestedannouncement can be made as soon as you$hink fit. But if you do not regard it asuelpful please refer to me again.    Subsequentsteps will not be elaborated until His Iviajesty&apos;sGovernment have had opportunity of peiscnalconsultation with yourself.    But they are anxious that before proceeding to england for such consultation you should have oppor-tunity of studying situation on spot and. of satisfying yourself as to (1) Measure of acceptance which proposals of His   Majesty&apos;sGovernment are likely to obtain and (2)further steps best calculated to give effectto them,    I^or this purpose you will doubtlesswish to make yourself acquainted without delaywith Mesogotamian opinion of every shadeincluding if you think fit that of Baghdadiesoutside Mesopotamia, for whose inclusion in thescheme provision will have to be made,   asregards latter you may at your discretionaddress Cairo direct, repeating to London.His Majesty?s Government realise that yourenquiries must take some time and they hopeyou will stay on at Baghdad as long as youdeem desirable.    Your investigations may perhaps remove all necessity for Mesopotamiandeputation to England as recommended by Wilsonwhich we are anxious to avoid if possible- vi thoutprejudice to situation, but your advice on thispoint would be welcome, ends.
