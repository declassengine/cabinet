The Minister of Transport stated that a Whit leyIS.Industrial Council representing the Tramways,  including boththe tramways owned by Municipal Authorities and by companies, had recently been held at which it was agreedthat.an increase in wages was necessary,  of.not more than10/- claimed by the men,     At the same time, both sided,agreed that the undertakings could not afford an increasedwage so long as the charges to the Public were kept within;the existing statutory, maximum.      The Ministry of Transport &quot;V .had power to take over undertakings owned by Companies andto authorise on increase in tho charges above the statutorymaximum, but.they had no such power&quot; in respect of Tramwaysowned by Municipal Authorities,      The accounts hod been examined and it was quite clear that,  with the existing charges the Companies could not afford higher wages at present.,    Hehad therefore undertaken to recommend to the Cabinet at theearliest possible moment that a Bill should be introduced-  permitting the charges to be increased above the statutorymaximum.      The workmen refused to be satisfied, without apublic announcement that the Government were&apos; taking stepsto have the charges raised,  3nd had been told by their leaders to hand in notices for a strike to take effect asfrom April 3rd.It was proposed to introduce a Bill extending thepowers of the Ministry of Transport so as to enable them toauthorise an increase,  above the statutory maximum,  of charges to the Public for tram-fares in the case of tramsowne d1.

This it was thou.glrt,would be a sufficient essuran.ee to thcmen-wbto-^iyere nowthreatening to strike.The Conference agreed       -That a Bill to this effect should beintroduced forthwith in the House of Commons,by the Minister of Transport.(3)      Some discussion took place as to the recentpublication in the Daily Herald (25th March 1920) of ansccouiit of a plot alleged to have been prepared by theWar Office to place a cordon of troops round mining areas to starve the miners out.      It was stated that it wouldbe possible to prosecute the Daily Herald under D.CR.A..-,and that probably a conviction could be. obtained, but itquestioned whether it would be wise to give the DoilyHerald the wide advertisement which such a course would ensure.The Conference decidedTo defer the further discussion of thismatter until the present negotiations onthe cool situation were conluded.2, Whitehall Car dens,  S.W.1.29th March,  1920.
