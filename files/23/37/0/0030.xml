The Conference had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health calling attention to the seriousstate of the financial position of the --Government :s housing programme * (CcP. 1183).The Conference were informed that whereas tenders for100,000 houses had boon received by tho Local Authorities,submitted to the Ministry of Health, and finally approvedby thorn,.work on these houses in a largo number of caseswas suspended,or ,had. not begun,for lack of moneys   . This was particularly the case in the Metropolitan Area and in the.immediately surrounding counties.    .   The London CountyCouncil had proposed to issue  7,000,000 in- stock at 6;i-&apos;; but onthe first day of the issue Treasury Bills were put up to6-Jf  - with the immediate result, it was alleged, that 90$of tho whole London County Council issue was legt with theunderwriters *     The further effect was to hold up the issueof stock by the County Councils of Middlesex, Essex, and Kent -and to delay ac tual building operations for six or sevenweeks. It was also suggested that the now Government Bonds,the issue of which had boon announced by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer this week,with- a guaranteed minimum rate of bfo -per annum, would have a pro judicial effect on the Housing; Bondscampaign.-It was. argued from tho Treasury standpoint that the new government Bonds would probably appeal to a quite - different clasof investor, and that it was doubtful whether that class wouldnot prefer a certain 1% to a guaranteed 5/o with-, a fluctuatingrate above that figure.   . There was the further consideration,to be borne, in mind that,if the present effort to deal with-the floating - Debt met with-substantial success., it would have .-an important effect in checking further rises in prices, and inthe rate of Interest.
The attention of the Conference was called&apos; to the .dt fleul-ites connected-with certain Local Authorities-..--whoserateable, value was over  200,000 and who could not for that reason ----&quot;borrow from the fsiblio Works Loans Commissioners.-It was generally, agreed that special measures were requiredto meet the needs of such cases.It was also agreed that some machinery: was necessaryto prevent undue competition and overlapping between-theGovernment and Municipal Loans and between one Local&apos; authority and another in their effort to raise money,- and that for thispurpose A small committee of City&apos;experts might be useful asadvisors to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofHealtho     This- suggestion met.with the general approval ofthe Conference aThe C onforence dec idod:-That the following Committee -Sir - L*&apos; TTorthington Evans ,Dr Addis on,Mr - Stanley Baldwin,-Mr Blackstt,Mr RsBs Howes th,- Secret ary,should meet that afternoon to consider:&apos;(1) The appointment cf a small Committee of Cityoxperto to advise the Chancellor of the Exoaeq-uer and the Minister of Health on the raising of money&apos;for the Government-1-a Housing programme.(2) The special cases of towns witha rateable value over  200,000 which were finding Itdifficult to raise money, for housing.(3) The question of-departing from the &amp;% rateof interest- in special circumstances, and generally,(4) The basis for the statement to be made bya the Prime Minister at the Guildhall meetingon Monday... next *The Representatives, of the Treasury explained thatthey had. not been able to consult the Chancellor&apos;of the Exchequer on the questions raised at the meet-ingo, but they would - at once lay them before mr chamberlain for his consideration.-2 Whitehall Gardens,..April 30th, 1920
