iM* POLICY With reference to Conclusion 1 6f a Conference3LAND, .of Ministers, hold on May 28tht at 4v&amp;&amp;&apos;&apos; p.m. 9 the chief secretary for Ireland was requested&apos; to make a statoment tothe Conference outlining the position of affairs- in Ireland&apos;and the policy which the&apos; Irish Executive proposed to adopt, &apos;The Chief Secretary, in the course&apos; of his statement,said that he considered that the most important task of theIrish Executive was to stamp out the campaign of murder and&apos;arson which prevailed more&apos;particularly in Dublin and in thoCounties of Limerick;, Cork and &quot;Kerry.    All their other difficulties were subsid.iai\y to - this.      After giving details&apos;&apos;regarding the methods employed by the organisers of theseoutrages, the Chief Secretary passed oh to the means by    &apos;which they should be&apos;combated.    He expressed himself againstthe introduction of martial law at the present moment,&quot; but would prefer to await the result of the hew method&apos;of puttingdown outrages by the use cf mobile troops.&quot;    He had great confidence in this plan, which has been1suggested by Sir HevilMacready and which was being developed energetically by him.Some discussion then followed regarding the effective-ness of introducing martial law. but doubt was expressed as tthe desirability of placing supremo power&apos; in the iiands&apos;of&apos;aCourt Martial.Attention was then drawn to the assistance . which, wouldbe rendered to the Irish E-eoutive in dealing with,their,difficulties if only moderate public opxnion in Ireland weredefinitely on t^ftir side and incensed against the perpotra-tors and instigators of&apos; outrage.     &quot;It was/ suggested&apos; that &quot;thebest means of ensuring this lay in&apos; some pj.an whereby&quot;Irish-men were made to feel the /effect of the campaign of murder&apos;&apos;and arson along economic channels.    It would, no doubt, beimpossible to do tins by iaeans of increasing the local \taxation, but it might be possible to increase the pecuniaryburdens of the Irish people by intercepting for the paymentof compensation etc., equivalent    and other grants in aiddue from the Treasury to the Irish Local&apos; &apos; -   . -&quot;.-1-..V .
Authorities.   Mention vas ms.de ox the fact that the irish executive already had a Bill drafted which carried out thissuggestion, and it was generally agreed that such a Billshould he introduced in -Parliament without.delay,Reference was also made to the affect which would he  .created by a curtailment of the.every-day facilities of any area which was disaffected: e.er, , postal and.railway facilit-ies together, perhaps, with an embargo-on the marketable products of such an area.It was generally agreed that the introduction&quot; of martial law at this moment was undesirable, but that it might be possible to obtain all the advantages and none of the -dis-advantages of such a course by rev-.i\ lag some of the powers given by Acts of Parliament ( e*gc, the Spencer and ZarcourtActs) which had been passed to deal with difficulties somewhat similar to those, which existed at the present time.The Conference decidedThat the Irish Executive, after consulta-tlon with .the ...iorcl Chancellor and the attorney-General for Great Britain,  should consider and make recommendations to theCabinet as to  (a) Lapsed powers contained in Acts ofParliament, which might, be revived atthe present time by the Irish executive:(b) The best method of imposing fines and penalties on Irishmen in an affectedarea;(c) The best method of interfering with theevery-day facilities of .an affected area.PWATIOH The Conference further decided        -A SPECIALpOE*   , That the decision .of the Cabinet&apos; regarding.the recruitment of a special force (see cabinet 30 (20) s Oonoiuaion 4) should&quot;&apos;&quot;b&quot;erer o/onSiTore a Tn./aT week &quot;&quot;or ten days.1 time:in the meantime,; the Secretary of State for&apos;.7ar to take no action. &apos;        . .o u o 4 ooWhitehall Gardens, 3.W.I.May 31st, 1920,
