AT SUPPLIES.       (l) With reference to Cabinet 11 (19),  Conclusion 3,  theConference continued the consideration of the Meat Situation,with special reference to the effect which the decontrol of imported meat might have on its price and on the price ofhome-produced meat, and on the Government&apos;s undertaking to the farmers.It was explained that the Ministry of Pood, by removin-all registration of customers, could automatically removeall restrictions on consumption.    Further, some administra-tive charges would be saved by withdrawing the- Ministry of food from the position of intermediary between the Boardof Trade and the Associated Importers.    Emphasis was laid on the importance of the Board of Trade maintaining for the imported meat a price which,  on the average, would not involve any loss to the Government.      There would be reasonable complaint if the Government were found to bedumping imported meat below cost price.    It was recognisedthat this policy might be found difficult, owing to thelong period during which some of the meat had been in store,and the Government might be forced to incur some lossultimately in getting rid of inferior qualities.   On theother hand,  the policy now proposed did not involve therepudiation of the bargain which had been entered intowith the farmers, who would continue to receive theschsduled prices.    Purther,  tho freeing of imported meatmight very well lead to the national consumption of meatreaching the pre-war level,  from which it had fallen duringthe war.    The apprehension of a probable stringency ofsupply next year might,  it was suggested, prove to be un-founded so far as it was based on the anticipation of sub-stantial purchases of meat by the Central European countries the Conference agreed to recommend the Cabinet  -(a) To decontrol imported meat:(b) To instruct the Board of Trade to dispose of the stocks of imported meat at a price which,  on the average, would avoid financial loss to the Government:-1-
(c) To continue tho control of hone-producedneat, in the inter vis t of tho farmers!&apos;(d) To withdraw the machinery for the registration of customersi(e) To terminate the present system by whichthe Ministry of Pood acts as. intermediary between the Board of Trade pad the wholesalers.The Conference authorised - -Tho President of the Boord of Agricultureand Fisheries, end the Food Controller tointimate tho above conclusions to theConference of Farmers to be held that afternoon, and to offer the ferrors the option of continuing or abolishing thecontrol of home-produced meat, tho detailsof the announcement to the farmers to beagreed, before the Conference net, by theDepartments concerned (the Treasury, theBoard of Trade, the Ministry of Food, theBoard of Agriculture r.nd Fisheries, andthe Scottish Office).(2)    The Conference had. before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (P?.per CP.-251) in whichhe proposed that, as the Mercantile Mrrine was during thoWar a fighting forco in a very real sense of the  -nrd, themembers of it who had been given the British Empire order should bo placed In the Military Division of the Order,instead of In the Civil Division.Tho Conference decidedThat the awards, of the British Empire Orderto the Mercantile Marine should hot bel:r;: ted by the scale applied In the Navy&apos;ana Army, hut should be considered ontheir own merits.$3)     The Conference had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (Paper cp.--123) on tho questionof erecting memorials to the British Army on the variousbattlefields.    The Conference was asked to consider thequestion from the point of view of principle, as to whether public money sho\ild be spent on the erection of wrr memorialson the principal battlefields where the British Army had fought during the late war.It -ms suggested that one monument was sufficient ineach theatre of war, including Mesopotamia; that this might

T. -7193);A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forIndia (Paper G.T.7250),A Memorandum by.the Minister of Munitions,covering draft Bill (Paper G,T.-7o07),A Memorandum* by tho Minister of Munitions(Papor G.T.-7007 A.)Committee of Hone Affairs 28, Minute 3:Note by the Acting Secretary (Paper G.T.-7284)It was pointed out that as so many members of thepresent. Government had at one time or another been incharge of the Ministry of Munitions,Ministers had themselves:a far more extensive knowledge of- the subject under consider?tion than could possibly be acquired by any Committee theHouse
of commons might&apos;appoint.    It was certain, moreover,  thatsuch a Committee would discover serious differences.of opinion among Ministers.;-$n the br&amp;ad merits cf the question whether thereshould he a aeparate Ministry of Supply,  opinicte which had-heen held during the War had,  in seme cases, &quot;been changed,owing to the fact that during the next five years the Armyand the Royal Air Force would be living on their surplusattres, and the number ef purchases to he made would he too small to justify a separate purchasing organisation, particu-larly in view of the fact that any separate organisation would involve considerable duplication of staffs.    TheiRighting departments,  on the c-ne hand, would require staffstc focus their demands, while the Ministry of Supply wouldalso, require staffs to examine and carry out the requisitionoade.   Moreover, under the present system the Fighting Depart-ments were faced with the great difficulty of not being ableto knew exactly what figures to put in their Estimates,  owingto the fact that the estimates of cost made by the Ministryof Munitions were continually changing.   It was essential,moreover,  for the Air Ministry to control the technicaldepartments for the production of aircraft,    it. was impossibleto separate design from supply,  and design must be in thehands of the Air experts.    Were it a case for bulk production&apos;on a large scale, design might be separated from supply;but during the next few years there would be no bulk produc-the. . If the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force were to obtain their supplies through a separate Department, it would putthpm in a very difficult position and make it impossible ,forthem to accept responsibility for their Estimates,, besidesinvolving an immense Departmental correspondence and greatfriction at every step in the proceedings.It wa3 also suggested that there would be the greatest difficulty in inducing the House of Commons to pass theproposed Bill involving the retention of the immense organisa-tion of the Ministry of Munitions.:  -  4 -
1       *&apos; 1120n the other hand,  it was pointed out tb,a-t &quot;d;h.e...j3xp er i enciVf the &quot;War had shown that the great Departments of theState were continuously---o^mpeting&quot;with one another for labourand materials, with the result that ccntraotors were able toplay off cne Department against another,  and a general enhancement of prices was inevitable.    It had also been found thatthe Departments were in the practice cf making such heavy demands that in seme cases they continued buying a Commodityalthough there were altogether ten years&apos;  stocks at the dis-pasal of the Government.    In the result, many millions   ofmoney had been wasted, and this would continue unless there-were a central buying agency.    Moreover, it was impossible,under the. present system,  for the Chancellor cf the exchequer to determine at the end of any year the assets in the handstjf the Government.Further,  it was suggested that the Contract departments of the Admiralty and Y/ar office were not sufficiently aoquain-ted with trade conditions to know how economy could be se-endeavoured by slight alterations in the patterns of articles,  whichwould be matters&apos; of tommon knowledge to any trade expert,particularly,  for example,  in articles of every-day. use,  suchas cutlery and domestic utensils.It was pointed out that it was obvious that wherecertain stores were common to several Departments the amount required for stock,  if there were a central pool,  would beless than if each Department had its cwn reserves.On the other hand,  it was held that if - a Ministry ofSupply were established and other Departments simultaneouslymaintained their supply staffs,  the last state would be worse than the first, and it was therefore suggested that theproposal for a Ministry of Supply should only be countenanceden the assumption that Departments would eease their ownsupply organisations.
The opinion was expressed that the perscnJ.ja.-l of theService Departments were not sufficiently trained or suffi-cinetly expert in technical matters to exnand under war condi-tions,.and that for that reason the supply arrangements of the -Navy and Army had been had.    The design, the supervision ofmanufacture, and testing, had all bt yn under the control ofamateurs.   At the  same time, if technical matters were to be handed over to the Ministry of Munitions, the result would be tokill keanness in the Services.    It was suggested, therefore,that the remedy was not to set up a large and cumbersome Ministry,but to overhaul and staff properly the technical, designing and producing Departments of the Admiralty and the War Office, and.to insist upon technical matters being controlled by experts.The aim should be to organise the officials of the service departments on such a basis as to make it possible to expandthem into a Ministry of Supply on a large scale should anothergreat war break out.    Had that boon done in the past, six months would have been saved in the- late war.It was generally agreed that for the purchase of ordinary trade articles, such as boots, clothing and. consumablestores, there would, be a great -advantage in a system of centralbuying, hut that for that purpose a Department of a much lessambitious character than that contemplated would be sufficient.Emphasis was laid on the fact that, while there mightbe a  system of common production for small arms, ammunition,rifles and machine guns, the requirements of the various services for the higher classes of ordnance were so different in character, owing to the necessity for extreme accuracy in naval ordnance, that It would be a fatal error to attempt totakeaway control in such matters from the Departments respect-ively concerned.   It was also pointed out thai the late Boardof Admiralty had exhaustively.examined the problem, and were ofopinion that they could not be responsible for the efficiency
of the Fleet if the higher forms of equipment were removed fromtheir control, and that the new Board of Admiralty appointed afew months ago were of the some opinion.   The view was expres-sedthat, Inasmuch as this view was generally known outside the Service-s-,-it would he extremely difficult to carry a Bill through the Houseof Commons on the lines proposed.Reference was made to the effect In time of war of thedemands made on the man-power of the country owing to competition &apos;between the Supply Departments of the various Services.    It was urged that, in the case of a future war, the control of the manu-facturlng processes of the country must be centralised, In order toavoid the overlapping demands for the e^eaption of men, otherwiseavailable for the Admy, made by the Admiralty, the Air Ministry andthe Ministry of Munitions.It was suggested, after further discussion, that theFighting Departments should prepare a list of the articles whichthey were ready to take from a common Supply Department and thata Committee should be appointed to consider whether the Office ofWorks, the Stationery Office and the nucleus of a new buying organ!-sation might not be combined into one Supply Department.The Conference agreed :-(a) To reject the proposal to refer the matter toa select Committee of the House of Commons:(b) That the Fighting Departments should draw up lists of stock commodities and standardisedarticles which might with advantage be thesubject of common purchase and manufacture,and should forward the same to the Ministerof Munitions, who undertook to make further-proposals after consultation with the first commissioner of Works, f-o-r--tho-eot-t ing-ttp-of&amp;-..41n1 stry o -Supply, whichy-whilst learvteg-n^^a4^da3 djrfred :&apos;Tochnical&quot;&quot;Supp-Iy-^-re-sptmsiri^ie-3 ^ie-e-j--4rhe-
