MINUTES of a Conference held at 10,  Downing Street,at IS Noon,  on 6th February, 1920, regarding demands to be made by Deputations of tho National Federationof Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers,the Comrades of the Great &quot;Jar and the national association which the Prime Minister was receivingthat afternoon.The Conference had before it.a summary of the questions to be raised by the Deputation from the Federation.JIITG     (1)    It was explained that the Federation of Discharged andDemobilised Soldiers, and Sailors and the Comrades of theGreat Jar were very Jealous of each other.   The former Bodyprofessed to have one million members but it was believed thatin reality they had nothing like that number.    The Comradesof the Great War Association had between 500,000 and 600,000and this was the more moderate Body of the two.    although these Deputations would raise a number of points that afternoonthe question in which they were interested most was that ofthe training.    These Bodies complained that there were not enough facilities for training disabled men and thoughtthat all the national factories should have been used fortraining&apos;purposes. &apos;    At the present moment, under the Ministryof Labour-Scheme,- 7,000 men had been trained, (Including broken-time apprentices, 42,000,^ 20,000 were awaiting training, and17,000 were in training at the present moment.The Ministry of Labour was endeavouring to obtain further Factories for those awaiting training but thistook time as before a building could be used for training purposes various Departments had to be approached andtheir consent obtained, &apos; iThe Treasury had to be approached regarding Finance,the Office of Works regarding the acquisition of the
3Ta-jt.ori-.es and the Disposal Board for plans,  it t^oksome time &quot;before a National Factory could he equipped for training purposes.    It was suggested that what waswanted waas a hi3 organiser who could give his servicesand work in conjunction with the Minister of Labour,    ^hisman should take over the whole Question of training the disabled soldi era- and have money placed at his disposalcn a war emergency basis.    When the first grant wasexhausted he should be allowed to co??e tc the Treasuryftr a further grant.     6,000,000 had been allotted inthis way to the Board of Education for the training ofwasofficers and it/thought something similar should bedone for the men.private employers had been approached and. were,  infact,  training a number cf men, but the obj ecticn tothis plan was that in many oases the men got no&apos;training at all as the employer put them tc work cn cheap repetitive-tion processes,    where, however,, the Ministry ofLabour could ensure that a man would get proper supervisionprivate employers baa been used.Figures were then given regarding the number of officers who had received a course of training either in Agricultureir at the Universities or other training, -institutions, andit appeared that&apos;41,000 officers had 30 far been trained.0eminent was made on the fact that the figure of men trainedcompared very unfavourably with that of the officers.Mr. currie of the Ministry of Labour was then askedto make ,suggestions for speeding up the machinery, fortraining disabled men.-Mr. currie said&apos; there were two great difficulties -(1) the delays in obtaining factories and adapting: themfor training purposes and (2) the difficulty in obtainingpermission of the skilled men in trade unions for the admission into the trade of disabled men when trained.For example,   the./
Ministry of Labour had agreed upon a scheme with the executive ofthe AAS .E&apos;. regarding the admission of Disabled Men into the Engineer-ing trade&apos;, but this scheme had been rejected by a ballot of the men,:It was essential to get the skilled men to modify their attitude Inthis respect&apos;..As regards the money required for, these schemes&apos;, he had nothing to complain of in the gross total which tho Treasury had sanctioned&apos;,hut he thought that the Ministry,of Labour/might be allowed to do morethan at present In the way of going ahead with schemes without their being exposed to meticulous financial examination.     What the Ministrywonted was more liberty, especially as regards engaging personnel and salary^ - v .He was certain that if progress &amp;rt war speed was desired cohdl*tlons resembling those which, obtained In the Ministry of Munitionswould have to be introduced, and subject to general Treasury Gontrol,the officer in charge of Training be made responsible for his ownf inane e,The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was quite ready tomeet the Ministry of Labour on the point of engaging personnel.If,for example, they desired to engage a number of temporary men withina specified range of salaries and the Treasury agreed to the number required, the Ministry of Labour &quot;could then appoint the men withoutreferring each individual case for approval.    If the Ministry ofLabour would bring to the Treasury a schedule of the number of menthey required to engage and their salaries^ he was willing to agreethat the Ministry should fill up the posts.   The Treasury had repeated^agreed to this procedure in the case Of temporary appointments *(2)     Sir Robert Borne said that the two bodies which the PrimeMinister was going to meet that afternoon, complained that the allow-ances of m^n undergoing tralnin.g were not sufficient.    The allowances were as followsfamily receivedA single man away fromA single man received .A married man- without ahome received
INEDIn addition 5/- a week efficiency bonus was paid, on completionof training*   To Increase these pates would mean putting up pen-slons for maximum disablement and this would lead to a great in-crease in cost.It was agreed that the above allowances were most generous and no increase couldbe madea(3)     Regarding the question of training men in agriculture LordLee said that the number of applications received to date was 30,000of which 5,000 had been refused.    The number of men.on the land at the present moment was 4,500 and the amount of land alreadyrequired for small holdings was 180,OOt, acres or 300 square miles.This should be sufficient to settle 15,000 men, and more land wasbeing acquired every day.-   The difficulty was after training aman for agriculture to    provide him with a small holding,    A further difficulty was with the partially disabled men.-   The work on asmall holding was very strenuous and It.was very much to be doubted whether a disabled man could work sufficiently hard to make a living?    Ij was not, however, the acquisition of land which was holding up the scheme, but the delay in the erection of buildings.So far not a single cottage had been completed by the Office ofWorks, but the Ministry of Agriculture was convinced that if theMinistry were allowed to build cottages on their own they could erectthe number required without the addition of a single man to their technical staff.    Many places, where the Ministry of Agriculturewished to erect cottages, were far from a village and the Officeof Works found great difficulty in obtaining the necessary labour,&apos;The Ministry of Agriculture felt that with itii own &apos;staff and withthe assistance of the settlers themselves and materials on the spotthey could build the cottages more quickly*   &quot;Perhaps they would notbe as elaborate as would be the case if the Office of Works under-took the work, but there would be less delay?Sir Prank Balnes said that six complete schemes for this work had been approved by the Office of Works and the work was
gnln^ on as quickly as possible.    Tke&apos; iolay\cwKuirr^ ..awjL^to it not being possible&apos; to get bulk labour on to jobs outin the wilds.    Whan it was possible, ths Office of Worksendeavoured to uso local contractors, but for various reasons the local contractors did not care to tender for&quot;   -      . . ..      - - ;.. &apos;the work. -  &apos; - -:&quot;- - . - -     &apos; &apos;.&apos; &apos;  &apos;      &apos;To the suggestion that the Ministry:of Agriculture:should build their own&apos;cottages, it was objected that the.Office of Works was the Building Department of the Govern-ment and that it was undosirable to set up another, and ;contrary tc provious Cabinet decisions. ;.Tho Prime Minister said that&apos;as only a few hundredoottagos were affected in this case and as no additional staff would be required the principle might be waived-,especially as the Ministry of Agriculture said&apos; they could&apos; -    &apos;  *.&apos; - --- &apos;   -    ... -. .-, . ,   .   . .        .,, &apos;.erect cottages in a short time.It was decided  ! &apos;That the Ministry of Agriculture should :furnish - the. Office of Works with a schedule of the cottages they wore pre--,pared to erect.and como to an arrangement whereby the Ministry would be responsiblefor their; erection..MEN&apos;(4-)     The Conference were informed that the Postmastor-POSTGeneral had instructed all Postmasters to employ as manydisabled men as was possible.   A Committee containingreprussenxativos of the Pootmaster-General and the TradeUnions examined the matter and recommended that where aman&apos;s capacity was below the usual standard, his wages should similarly fall below the ordinary rates - suchrates of wages to be- agreed upon by tho local Post-master and the local representative of the Trade Union.This recommendation was. turned down by the Executive ofthe Trade Union.-5-  4
ggHAL (5) &apos; With reference to the demand that a general amnesty&apos; sty. , .&apos;. &quot;&apos;./-:&apos;      .should he granted it wae stated that when the War ended564- persons were undergoing penal servitude and the totalsentences of these persons amounted to 2173 years 102sentences had been remitted and all. others reduced by1581 years-.      The number of men undergoing penal servitudeqow was 260.     - Of this number 174 were serving sentencesfor- desertion-;    49 were sevvi ng sentences for mut i ny-,striking,   etc.;    40 were&apos; serving sentences for murder,manslaughter and burglary..    The total number of men released from detention barracks was 1450.      An indiscriminaterelease of these prisoners oould.not. be&apos;racamaended,  buta continual review of the caaea would go on,.      The cages ofdesertion were bad ones  in whi ch .the men had left their units for a considerable time and hidden away in the villages behind the firing line.      If soldiers were not. punished for   d esertlon&apos;.  it would greatly effect&apos; the dis-decipline of the present Army. -..AP- (6)      On the question of war gratuities i t. was - explainedthat temporary officers received as a gratuity. :4 months.&apos;pay for the first year&apos;a service and.2 months1  pay forevery subsequent year,  but it must be remembered that theofficer received no leave on demobilization and was not qualified for the out-of-work donation.. . .       &apos; ,.   -As regards the men&apos;s gratuity,  the Cabinet had decided that the same principle should be adopted towards them as had been applied to the Regular Officers;    The menthought that they should be treated on the same, basis - asthe temporary officeri    To do so would cost nearly 100.millions.
The total benefit for officers and men ondemobilization reckoned in terms of day&apos;s paywas as follows:-&apos;   &apos; ; -        . Al;&apos;Officers.1st Year2nd     &quot;3rd4th &quot;5 th     &quot;124186243310372Men.255329386437485In addition men were free to draw unemployment benefit.LASS &quot;Z&quot;    (7)     With reference to the demand that Class MZ&quot; reserveiESERVSoshould be abolished it was pointed o\it that this was instituted in order to facilitate rapid demobilizationand at present it was possible to call all the men up for service.     This precaution was considered necessary,having in view the state of Europe at that time, butthe &quot;z&quot; Reserve would cease to exist on the statutoryend of the war.     A pledge had been given in the House ofCommons that all conscripts would be demobilised by the 30thApril this year,XR GRAVES.(8)     With regard to the demand of the two Associationsthat facilities should be given to relatives to visit thegraves of the fallen, there were 500,000 in Prance and flanders, which would mean that 1 million relativesmight want to visit them.      It would take some time toorganise visits as most of the graves were in devastatedareas where there were no habitations.    It was generally agreed that the present time was premature for arrangingvisits, but that it might be possible to grant facilitieslater,(9)      With regard to this q\*estlon, attention was drawn,to the fact that the Cabinet had already decided thatPre-war Pensions could not be increased (W.C.591, Minute3)N-WARRSIONS.
Attention was also drawn to the fact that if tho Pre-warPensions of ox-Sailors and soldiers were increased it would necessitate a similar increase to the police, teachers   andes-servants of the State, generally.The Chancellor of tho Exchequer was requested toascertain what the cost of increasing such pensions,would amount to.2 &quot;hitehall Gardens, S..&apos;.l,6th February, 19 2.?.
