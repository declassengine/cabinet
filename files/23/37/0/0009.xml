-\TESv    &apos; &quot; &apos;&apos; &apos;    The Confer e-ti&amp;i had under;consideration a Memorandum&quot;by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, (Appendix)regarding the issue of mandates under the League of nations for territories captured and occupied by the Allied Pcwers,and suggesting that in,every case ^here (1) A particularex-German Colony has been assigned t*   X as mandatary by a unanimous resolution of the Supreme Council and (2) Xis prepared to accept the mandate under the conditions unanimous-imously agreed to by the Council, the Powers should new beasked to issue mandates to   X., without delay and without waiting for the deposit of ratifications.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES explained thatalmost every day he was receiving telegrams from the Domln-ions clamouring for the issue of mandated, and raising veryawkward questions.   He had not so far circulated Papers onthe subject, but he desired that the Cabinet should becognisant of the nature of possible trouble in this connection.Months had passed since decisions were taken in Paris as tomandatory powers,  m&amp; the terms of the mandates were considered at length and agreed uponj yet the actual mandates were not forthcoming.    It was very difficult to explain the situation to the Dominions especially Australia, whose representations were of a most pressing character.   TJnd^r the Treaty of PeaceGermany ceded her colonies to the Five Principal Powers,whose representatives in Paris had agreed to whom these territories were to be assigned but the mandates could notbe Issued until peace had been ratified.    In   his view it was urgently necessary that iscmsdel ite action should be taken beforethe Paris Conference broke up.   The decision of the Council inParis did not by itself transfer the territories in question to whomto the parties,/the  .mandates.were to be assigned
On the ratification of the Treaty, these territories would, all pass to the Five Powers.   A practical way ofdealing with the situation Would be that the Five powers should formerly transfer them to the several mandatories.The actual machinery would consist in a series of Conventionsbetween the Five Powers on the one part and the particularmandctcry on the other. Forms of such Conventions had actually been drawn up.    The real point was, should the BritishEmpire take Its own line, based upon the decisions takensome months before in Paris, or should it await suchdefinite authority from the Allied Powers?Some discussion follcwad in which it was stiggested thatthe best thing to do might be to assume that the decisions which had been taken by the Plenipotentiaries, and had beenpromulgated, was validj if this validity was to be calledinto question, it would be for the League of Nations to do so.It was pointed out that without a formal assignment of the mandated territories legal difficulties might arise for in-*stance. In the case of German- East Africa.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS read out anote which had &quot;been prepared by Mr. Hurst of the ForeignOffice, which enquired whether he should proceed .with thepreparation of drafts of Conventions with the various powers concerned, whereby the said Powers would formally recognise the mandate of the British Empire for certain territories.Lord Curzon said he had been deputed by his colleagues toattend the first meeting of the League of Nations, which T-as o be held In a fortnight &apos;s time, and   asked whether theCabinet desired that he should prepare the drafts and submitthem to the Allied aid Associated representatives at themeeting.
The Conforenoe agreed :That the Foreign Secretary shouldfa)    Prepare draft Conventions, hut thatthese: should not he submitted air-present to the Allied Powers, as suchaotion might be construed as indioat-ing that we did not consider that wewere entitled to take over the oon-. trol of ufte territories mandated to.-us, unless and until the Conventionshad bejn signed:Government(b)    In the meantime sound the Ameriaan/through .7uiAmbassador in Washington, and find out whether the United States were likely to sign the pr*aoo:(q)    Obtain the opinion of his departmentalexperts in international law as towhether, in the event of only three-   of the Allied Powers ratifying thePeace Treaties the assignment by these three Powers to various mandatorieswould be valid:fd)    In the event of America signing,take the opportunity of the firstmeeting of the League of Nations,Subject to the Cabinet approving thisqourse, to get the Conventions signed.In the 5*urse of the above disoussion attention was drawn to a telegram from Sir. Eyre Crowe, dated 17th November1919, stating that,--regarding the contemplated cessions toItaly Sn the Western frontier of Egypt and in Jubaland,it had always beon understood by the British Delegatesin Paris that no definite oessions would be made except aspart ef the general arrangement; which v/ould include thequestisn of Asia Minor and. the Adriatic, and expressing thehope that there would be no departure from this understand-ing, as otherwise Great Britain would be deprived of hermost powerful and valuable lever in future bargaining with italy.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said, thatif we made certain concessions to Italy now, we couldalmost certainly obtain Italian recognition of our posirbionin Sgppt which, as the High Commissioner had recentlyurged, would be very valuable to us at the present moment.Other
other considerations3 however, wight outweigh this;: and itwas certainly the fact that re ranted&apos; something to bargainwith,In the case,, for instance, of   Adalia..   On the cholehe ras disposed to think that re should press for a general settlement later on-.    The Italians -were continually extending the venue.    In the case of the Adriatic, for example, theywere now opening their mouths much rider..    Jt was not nowmerely a question of Flume and a small strip of the coast;&apos;-they wanted the -whole of Yugo-Slav Istria behind, its . he himself thought the only solution of this question was for theItalians themselves to come to some agreement with Yugo-postponingSlavs i Hliaere were several good reasons^ for/a settlementnoi&quot;;Italy wanted to re-open the question of the Egyptianfrontiershe wanted a further extension of territory in east Africa, and she wanted more In Abyssinia.    He tos to seethe Italian Ambassador that evening,, and the Interview wor-ldgive Iilm the opportunity of taking whatever line hiscolleagues might decide upon.THE SECRETARY OF ST1.TE FOR THE COLONIES reminded theConference that a special clause of the Treaty of london of 1915 laid down that in the event of Franc e and Englandobtaining substantial conquests In Africa, Italy would beentitled to equitable consideration; and in Paris certainprovisional agreements had been reached&apos;as to ^hat was equivalent.-   None of our arrangements In Paris, however/,in his view, had any international validity until they wereformally embodied in some legal instrument.-The Conference agreed%That cessions to Italy, all of which arose out&apos;of a single instruments namely, the Treaty ofLondon should form, part of a general arrangement with that country, which would incitede Africa,the Adriatic and Asia Miner,and
and requested the foreign Suore^tary. 1b inform theItalian Ambassador and-Sdr Eyra-Srowein the above sense.2. Whitehall Gardens.S* W, I21st november 1919,
A ?P1H MI,Memprandum by tho Secretary of State for the PoloniesMy life is rendered a harden to me by telegrams&apos; from theDominions (generally addressed to the Prime Minister2 butreferred to me to suggest a reply) clamouring for the issueof &quot;Mandates&quot; for the Pacific Islands, German South WestAfrica, etc., etc.I fully realise the awkward position in which,&apos;Australia,Mew Zealand and South Africa are all placed through having no formal authority to legislate for or otherwise deal with-the territories assigned to them by resolutions of the&quot;Supreme Council&quot; in Paris.     For my own part I am in quitethe same kind.of difficulty over Bast Africa.    Almost everyday,some problefti arises,which requires for its solution,,that we should know whether we have or have not the authorityof a Mandatory Power over that cettntry.All the 3pade-work necessary for the,issue of Mandateshas been laboriously done.     The conditions to be imposed onMandatories of the B and C classes have been approved by the&quot;Supreme Council&quot;, and, except in the case of Togo andCameroons, with respect to which there is a hitch * Francebeing unwilling to accept her share of these Colonies underthe normal &quot;B&quot; Mandate - there is n6 substantial reason WhyMandates for all the territories, whose destiny has beendecided by the &quot;Supreme Council&quot;, should not issue any day.But there is a difficulty of form.    The Treaty withGermany vests the Colonies given up by her in the principal allied and Associated Powers.     It may be urged that, untilthe Treaty is brought into force by the deposit of the neeess-ary number of ratifications, this vesting is hot complete andtherefore these Powers have as yet ho right to dispose of theColonies.     But this argument opens up a long vista offurther uncertainty.    The coming into force of the Treaty isbeing delayed from week to week and from month to month. . Theaction of America may lead to a great deal more delay. . He -would be a bold man, who ventured to assert that the treaty will come into force this year or that the settlement,, whichit is intended to effect, will not have begun to crumble -away before the coping stone has been put upon the edifice.And again, oven If the Treaty; does come into force thisyear, but America stands aside, it may be argued that, whileAmerica oannot concur in the issue of Mandates under theTreaty because sho is not a party to-&apos;it,-., the- four other powers, cannot dispose of the ceded Colonies without Americanconcurrence.I can see no way out of all this tangle, in which wehave now been living for months, except to get away fromtechnicalities and take immediate action based on the substant-ial merits, of the case.      I therefore suggest that in every-case where (l) a particular - ex-German Colony has been assig-ned to Z as mandatory by a unanimous resolution of the&quot;Supreme
&quot;Supreme Council&quot; and (Z) 2 is prepared to accept the Mandateunder the conditions unanimously agreed to &quot;by tho Council, thoPowers should now &quot;be asked to issue a Mandate to X with-out delay and without waiting for the deposit ofratifications.      Germany has &quot;by ratifying tho Treaty given up all claim to those Colonies,,      The Principal Allied powers have already pledged thornselves to deal with them in aparticular way.      Why not give effect to that pledge atonce,  instead of leaving the Administration of these territories, whose ultimate destination is certain,  in a prolonged welter of indofinitoness and of temporary and provisional arrangements ?The invitation to do this should he, addressed to theGreat Powers represented at Paris before the present conference breaks up.     Even if America, in view of the uncertainty of her adhesion to tho Peace Treaty,  did notoare to join in tho issue of Mandates at the present time,I see no reason why the other Principal Allied and associated powers should not execute the necessary documents, leaving it to America to become a party to them if or when shewas so minded.(Initialled) M.November, 1919.
