(1) &quot;ITith&apos;reference to their meeting held On Saturday.,December&apos;&quot;firth..., at-$--3$ pym.., the Conference had before thema telegram dated December 7th. (No. 167*5) from. Sir Eyre Crowe,-reporting the results *of, an interview which he and Mr PhilipKerr had had with Li. Gleiaenceau (Appendix)..L.. Glcaenceau had not been able to agree to the draftef the final paragraph of the despatch to Germany proposedby the Conference., but had agreed to accept a  r-tfh   draft,which was translated in the telegram as follows:-*Until the Treaty comes into force we remindGermany once mere (une derfliere fois) thata denunciation of the Armistice, suffices toleave the Allied Armies every latitude as: regards -such military measures ?.s they may consider necessary.    This being the situation(literal: ..-dans oet esprit) we await the signature of the Protocol and the depositef ratifications without farther delay&quot;.The Conference, taok nete that M. Clemenoeau hadreiterated his firm conviction that even in this revised formthe note would undoubtedly lead to Germany&apos;s immediate accept-ance Of the demands of the Allies.   Their -attention was drawn,however, te an interyiew,repQrted in wThe Daily Mail&quot;,with herr Noske9 the -Ge-man ^ar Mini star 9 in which the latter had stated, categorically that he would recommend the GermanGovernment&apos; mat to sign the Protocol.The Chief of the Imperial General Stafr also reportedthat Marshal Poch was very doubtful if the Germans would sign.while the Conference :.felt that the draft now proposed was less satisfactory than the draft they had themselvessuggested, and that the evidence of its probable acceptance by the Germans- was by no means.satisfactory, nevertheless,having regard to the fact- that the American plenipotentiarieswould be leaving Paris on the following day, the^ felt thatno other course was -open to them than to accept the new draft, which ^s*wat--.any rate, a substantial improvement, onthe original draft.      It was therefore agreed.-That the Secretary-of State for ForeignAffairs should immediately infom Sir EyreCrowe that the new draft was accepted by-.- the British Government,, . and. that he had/authority to sign /the ;,des patch.
? OF THE ? CONFERENCE.

(2) It was generally agreed that the present constitution of the Supreme Council in Paris was not altogether satisfactory, and that sufficient safeguards were not provided against crises such as that now under consideration. Owing to the exigencies of the political business at home, it is impossible to spare a Cabinet Minister, and Great Britain is only represented by an official of the Foreign Office. Great Britain is therefore at a disadvantage compared with France, which is represented by one of the greatest statesmen of the day. The withdrawal of the American representative was, therefore, held to provide a good opportunity for reconsidering the future of the Peace Conference, and with this object in view it was considered desirable that Sir Eyre Crowe should accompany M. Clemenceau on his forthcoming visit to London.

It was agreed -

That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct Sir Eyre Crowe to accompany M. Clemenceau on his forthcoming visit to London.                                                   

ITALY AND THE ADRIATIC.

(3) The attention of the Conference was invited to the latest development in the attitude of the Allied and Associated Powers towards Italy&apos;s claims in the Adriatic.

The British, French and American representatives on the Supreme Council had recently drawn up a statement of the present attitude of their respective Governments towards the Italian claims. They had proposed to communicate this statement to Signor Sciale ja, the new Italian Foreign Minister, before his departure for London. At the request, however, of the British Government, who had felt that it would embarrass them, in their conservations with Signor Scialo ja if this memorandum had been presented, the matter had been postponed. Sir Eyre Crowe had now telegraphed pointing out that if there were any further delay in signing the memorandum it would be impossible to obtain the signature of an American plenipotentiary, since the American Delegation


was leaving Paris oft&apos;Dec^gmber 6th.   He therefore asked for authority to sign, with a view to the memorandum beingpresented to Signor scialcja on his return from London.The Seoretary of state for Foreign Affairs wished tohave the views of the conference both as to sir.Byre Crowe&apos;request and as to the attitude he himself should adopt towardsSignor Scialoja, whom he was expecting to meet at. luncheon.Would he, for example, be justified in showing signor ScialoAVi.the memorandum ?    Should he give any indication that thememorandum might be altered after his conversation withSignor Scialoja ?   In this latter connection he drew atten--tion to the danger that signor scialoja might make anattempt to divide the British, French and American Gavern-ments on the subject.The general opinion nf the Conference was in thefoilswing sense :-(a)&apos; That the Secretary &quot;ef State far psreignAffairs would be justified in givingSignor scialeja the gist of the memerandum,explaining to him that this was what theAllies proposed to present to the ItalianGovernment,  and that he thought that asSigner Soialoja. was in Dendon it would be-only right to talk to him about it;(b) That the Secretary ef State.f^r ForeignAffairs should reserve hi3 decision inregard to Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;s request for- authority to sign the memorandum until,after he had seen Signor Scialoja:(o) In any case,.anything in the nature ofan ultimatum&apos;to Italy must be avoided.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1..8th December, 1919.
APPENDIX.&amp;e-cypher.Sir E.D. 7thR,  8thCrswe (Astoria, Paris),December,  1919&apos;No-  1670.SUB- COMMITTEE.Draft note to Germany.Mr. Kerr and I saw M. Clemenceau to-night on his return from country.     He agrees to omission 6f secondsencenee of concluding paragraph of note.     The first sentence of that paragraph really f^rms part Of argument in preceding paragraph 9* which contains withdrawal from position we had taken up in protocol.     The protocolhad explicitly reserved right of Allies in -oase of non-fulfilment of its conditions to resort to such military measures as might -be required to enforce their demands.     To this Germans objected, that as signature(694-H) ef Protocol is to coincide with coming ints forcewe should at once. come- under conditions of peace whichwould net admit of one party proceeding to reopenhostilities without a fresh declaratien of war.     We have recognised force of this argument and conceded German,point by saying that once peace is re-established bycoming into force of treaty or deposit tf ratifications,-the treaty itself will afford necessary guarantees forenforcement of stipulations of Protocol and that ordinaryrules ef law ef nations i.e.   - Ho hoek&amp;facilities prior todeclaration of war, will apply.     But we add (group unde-oypherable)  in first sentence of concluding paragraph,until treaty of peace dr.es become operative, the Allies-retain power to resort tc military measures by simplytermJujCkting armistice.This is a statement cf fact!      It is moreover merelya restatement of what was already said to Germans in note in which we invited them to sign Protocol.     To withdrawthis warning altogether in face of Germany having re-called her delegates in answer to request tc signProtocol seemo to M. Clemenceau to go too far9     fie is however willing to attenuate sentence by making it quite clear that, whilst conceding German view of true position,as regards resort to military measures, we recallwarning already given that such resort though notcompatible with a state 6f peace would always remain open to Allies under regime of a prolonged armisticO.M. Cl-emenoeau would-accordingly&apos; accept followingwording for concluding ;pai*egraph   -    I translate literallyfrom Prench:
Until treaty cones into force we remind Germany once more (une derniere fois) that a denunciation of the;armistice suffices to leave Allied armies every latitudeas regards such military measures as they may consider .:necessary.   . This being the situation (literally:    dana cetesprit) we-await, signature of the Protocol and deposit ofratifications without further delay.M. ,&apos;Clemeneeau reiterates hi3 firm conviction that even in :this revised-form the note would undoubtedly leadto Germany&apos;s prompt acceptance of our demands.We said that of course we had no. authority to accept this wording but we agreed to refer it to-His Majesty&apos;eGovernment.     He was emphatic as to hie inability to goany further in his concessions to British view he hadearnestly requested our acceptance.     He repeated what hehad already declared at Supreme Council that French government-ment did not in any case contemplate military operations at present juncture.M.. Clemenceau cordially agreed to come over to london on W&amp;ineaday or Thursday provided that this question wasdecided and out of the way.As regards Scapa Flow reparation Mr. Polkas messageas,described in my telegrams No. 165? to which Prime Minister&apos;message to Mr. Kerr refers was modified subsequently as reported in my telegram No. 1662 when he agreed to formula which I had altered to meet his objection.     The sole differ-ence between Mr. Polk&apos;s last proposal and that now adoptedis that whilst he left ultimate decision entirely to reparations Commission the version adopted retains authorityOf Allies and Associated Governments to decide after hearingReparations Commission.     In pressing more effectual provision which I got adopted I have throughout acted on (group undecypherable) representations of my Naval advisers who had their instructions from Admiralty.     if in light of theseobservations you still think that we should revert to originalAmerican proposal I will raise question at tomorrow^meeting of Supreme Council on receiving your instructionsto this effect.. .May I remind you that Mr. Polk*s departure on TuesdayDecember 9th makes it imperative to get note to Germanssigned and despatched tomorrow.      Could you therefore let me have decision as early as possible tomorrow?
