Conference had under consideration an Admiralty Memorandum(Paper G.T.-8409) asking for directions as to the policy to be pursued in the Baltic during the coming winter./ discussion took place regarding the action vrtiichhad been taken up to date by the British ships in theBaltic, during which the Prime Minister expressed theopinion that the bombardment at long range of forts onshore- was doing more harm than good to British interests,The Seoretary of&quot;State for War deprecated any pro-j.osal to issue instructions for the immediate cessation ofthese bombardments until such time as it was practicableAA -to&apos;ascertain the exact situation at the moment.The Conference decided that -(ft) The Admiralty should instruct the senior naval Officer, Baltic, when forced byclimatic reasons to evacuate the gulf of Finland, to withdraw to England theS.W. whf-le of the British H&amp;val forces, with.W. the exception of a small force to showIcS.&apos; the Flag in the Baltic:(&quot;&amp;) The force to be retained in the Balticto show the Flag should be as small as
possible... and the- Admiralty should sub-mit for consideration details as to the size of the force which it is proposedto maintain for this purpose:(c). The Secretary of State for 7,&apos;ar should ascertain, and report to the prime MiB-ister,. the exact situation at the momenton the left flank of the forces operating against Petrograd, and the extent to which any order for the immediate cessation ofthe co-operation of the British Fleetmight affect this situation.EBX FUTURE      (3) With reference to War Cabinet 619, Minute 1, a shortH TURKEY.discussion took place regarding the desirability.of consider-ing the Turkish situation, during which the Prime MinisterAl pointed out that it was becoming clear that the UnitedStates of America would not be prepared to&apos; accept a mandate,and that it was very desirable that the whole question &apos;should be considered by the Cabinet at an early dateiThe Conference decided that -/ discussion on the general TurkishSituation should take place at anearly date. .In the meantime, the Secretary of State^or Foreign-Affairs undertook toexamine the. whole situation from thepoint of view of the latest information available, and to submit a Mcmoran-dum for consider;.-.tion.[ir/ji-jtri/l (4) The Conference had under consideration a MemorandumHurts bill,by the Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-6) covering a draftof the Industrial Courts Bill.  -It was explained that while, on the one hand, workmen--were agitated at the prospect of wages being reduced, andwere claiming, that war ndvances should continue in spite ofa possible fall in the price of food,  employers&apos;were anxious for a definite period of stable- wages,  -nd did not thinkthat food.could fall by the autumn of 192c.   -Provisionhad therefore been mrde to continue wages at the level atI
which they stood at the time of the Armistice -until September30,  1-920, unlejs altered by agreement or voluntary arbitra-tion:    &apos;-ind, at the same time, by abolishing :00mp.ul30ryarbitration, to remove the anomaly by which employers could,be compelled to go to arbitration when no such compulsioncould be exercised upon the workmen.    Provision .was made fora permanent Court of Arbitration.The opinion was expressed that a big fight would be caused by tho clause in the draft Bill providing that, wherevoluntary arbitration had been agreed upon,  a strike within,four months against tho award made at such arbitration, shouldbe illegal, and that the Trades. Disputes Act should-not apply.It was pointed out,  on the other hand, that, as the reference to arbitration would be purely voluntary, it wouldbe only fair that the parties should be held bound to honourthoir agreement to abide by the result of tho arbitration.Reference was also made to tho fact, that in some parts ofthe country there had recently been frequent&apos;strikes of school teachers, and it was pointed out that it might be a relief to the Local Authorities and to the:Board of Educationif teachers could havo recourse to tho arbitration procedureprovided by the Bill.The Conference decided -fa)    To approve the Draft Bill.(b) That it should be left to the Minister ofLabour, after conferring with the Labourleaders, to settle the point with regardto the clause in *he Bill making it illegalto strike against an award in an arbitrationwhich had been voluntarily entered into:(c) That tho Minister of Labour should confer with tho  resident of the Board of Educationwith regard to the insertion of a clause toinclude teachers in the Bill,iija, (5)    With reference to War Cabinet 635, Minute 5,  these OFGAR. Conference had under consideration a Memorandum by the FoodController (Paper G,T. - 8382) and a Eoto by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-8391).
The Chancellor of tho Sxchoquer atatod&apos;that,  accordingto tho Minutes, the War Cabinet had referred to the finance committee the question of an increase in the retail priceof sugar.    At the Finance Commit toe, which mot on tho follow-ing day, there had been no time to discuss- the question of sugar, and consoquontly.no decision had yot been come to asto whether the price-should be raised.Some discussion took place,  during which it was pointedout that a rise in price would be inevitable- after March 31of next year,  and that sugar was at present being subsidisedout of past profits.    It&apos;was also suggested that an immediate increase of Ed per pound should be made in place of the Id.as recommended by the Food Controller.Attention was drawn to the Table of Distribution of sugar, at the end of the Memorandum by the Food Controller(Paper G. t.-8382) ,  in .which, while jam manufacturers wouldroceivo only 130,000 tons ifci  1920,  other manufacturers would receive an much as 250,000 tons..    It was suggested that therewas no justification for cutting down augar supplies and;raising the price of sugar for jam and domestic purposes ifmanufacturers.of sweets were allowed so large a proportion.On tho other hand^ it was pointed out that tho allocation to &quot;other manufacturers&quot; included not only sweet-makers butbakers and mineral-water manufacturers, and all other usor3of sugar except condensed milk manufacturers and brewers; thatthe industries in question employed a largo amount of laboxzr;and that the effect of drastic-reduction would be&apos;severelyfelt amongst tho small retailers, as had boon the case in 1915The Conference decided -(a) To.approve the increase in the retail pricoof sugar by Id per pound:(b) To request tho Minister of Food and thoChairman of the Sugar Commission to re-consider the allocation of sugar supplies,in the light Of the criticisms at theConference,  and for this purpose to confer with the Minister of Health.-   -

Brunner, Mond &amp; Co.,acting on behalf of a syndicate.After a discussion, the Conference decided -(a) To accept the principle that the futured development of the Government&apos;s schemefor the. fixation of nitrogen .from the atmosphere and for combining nitrogen so obtained and hydrogen for the productionof ammonia and obtaining therefore nitricacid and ammonium nitrato should be leftto a commercial undertaking, subject tothe Government interests in the praductionof nitric acid and ammonium nitrato for service explosives being safeguarded.(b) That the fact that the Billingham Factorysite i3 available for disposal, for theproduction of synthetic ammonia by privateenterprise, should be publicly announcedforthwith.(o)    That the Report of the Mtrogon ProductsCommittee should be published at once.(d)    To authori3o tho Minister of munitions to disclose to the British chemicalmanufacturers such secret processes,patented by the Department during thewar, as may be considered of value tothe chemical industry of the country.(&amp;i    That negotiations with the Brunner MondSyndicate should, in the meantime, hopursued on the lines indicated in LordInverforth^ Memorandum of the 27th October,1919, with the object of obtaining an in-creasedmonetary payment, subject to theapproval of the Treasury as to the precise terms, and to a satisfactory arrangementbeing reached as regards the J&quot;,lectricalPower agreement.(f)    That the terms of the agreement with theSyndicate or other British purchaser should secure that a definite output of nitric acidwill bo available as soon as possible, andalso that tho Government should have a lionon the Lyndieate&apos;s, or other purchaser^manufacturing capacity in tho&apos;event of anational emergency.shall Gardens, S.W.1-October 31,  If19,
