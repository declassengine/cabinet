*.mi^        (1)    with. r^f^renoe-lxr^binet^S^the Conference had before them a Memorandum by the LordChancellor (Paper CP.-53) proposing that two additional judges should be appointed under the Supreme Court efJudicature Act, 1910, which had authorised the appointmentof two additional Judges in the King&apos;s Bench Division,subject to the limitation that, if the whole number ofPuisne Judges amounted to 15 or more, any future vacanciesshould not be filled unless an Address were presented from&apos;both Houses of Parliament,The Lord Chancellor asked the sanction-of the Confer-ence to the moving of an Address for this purpose in theHouse of Lords and the House of Commons.   He explained thatthere was great congestion of work in the King&apos;s bench division and the Divorce Court, owing to the demands forJudges for extra-judicial work, and to the revival ofbusiness in the Courts, which had shrunk considerablyduring the War.   A pressing request was being made by theChief Secretary for Ireland for a Judge to preside over theSpecial Tribunal to be set up under Oabinet 27 (30), Conolu-sion 8, and a Judge would also be required permanently toact as President of the Commission being set up under the indemnity Bill, in place of the Duke- Commission.   The LordChancellor also proposed to discontinue sending an AssizeJudge to some of the smaller County Towns,, there being nopossible justification for the continuance of Assizes atwhich there was no business to be done.Some doubt was expressed, however, as to the expediency, on public grounds, of curtailing the towns on the AssizeCircuit a .The Conference agreed  To approve the Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposal that Parliament should be asked to approve the presentation &apos;of an Address by bothHouses of Parliament under the SupremeCourt of Judicature Act, 1910,  represent-ing that the state of business in the King bench Division requires that the vacancies for .two additional Judges should be filled.
iiJOW^FREMn^        (2) Some diuJuni&amp;sjUn^l^ooJr^ had       ,      been roade unofficially by the French Government fo&quot; the--^^e^Tie^tra-tion- of&quot;-certain gold in the Bank of France, whichhad been surrendered.by the Germans under, the Brest-LitcvskTreaty, for the benefit of the Allies.    It was now proposedinformally that   this gold should be taken by the FrenchGovernment and used in part-payment of their share of theAnglo-French Loan,There was general agreement that the British. Govern-raent must insist that the French Government had no title tothe gold in question.Some discussion also took place on the French attitudetowards the fixing of a definite sum to be paid by germany in reparation.    It was explained that M. Millerand was infavour of fixing a definite sum, and was convinced that the120 milliards of francs previously proposed was not reason-ably to be expected.    It was now suggested that the BritishGovernment should guarantee German bonds up to the amountwe receive in payment for the Army of Occupation.It was explained that a representative of the Belgian-Government had asked to meet the Prime Minister that day.,ostensibly to discuss the Russian question, but it seemed probable that his real object was in connection with. reparation.It was agreed that.the Chancellor of the exchequer should be present at- the interview.
loVE^prRT OP (3) With reference to Cabinet 35 (20), Conclusion 1. th*;pSJAW BILL..- Conference had before them the Report of Mr Loner/s Committeeluspensorypause, of Ministers on the Government of Ireland Bill, relating toIthe Suspensory Clause (Paper CP.-1453).The Committee recommended  (i) That provision should be made in theBill- for an Oath of Allegiance to betaken by candidates for parliament before they could be allowed to standas such, and that such an Oath shouldbe administered&quot; by the returning officer,(ii) That a nominated assembly, perhaps of smaller size but sufficient to form a quorum, should be substituted for the elected assembly, with the same powers as are provided in the Bill, in theevent of the Parliament of southern ireland either refusing to functionor endeavouring to act unconstltu-tionally.Attached to.the Committee&apos;s Report, as an Appendix,was the draft of a Suspensory Clause which they recommended for adoption.It was suggested that the qiiorum necessary forcarrying on the Parliament of Southern Ireland might bereduced from one-half to one-third, - and that it would be worth while for the Imperial Government to support a Parlia-ment of forty loyal men who were prepared to carry on theadministration.The Conference agreed  -To accept the recommendations, togetherwith the draft Suspensory Clause, made inthe Report of Mr LoagVs Committee (paper cp.-1453), but that, if it was foundnecessary in Committee, the quorum forthe Southern Parliament should bereduced from one-half to one-third.
S (4) Withvr^J^HT^rtr-OOv J5owning Street,  on Friday,  June 11, 1920, at 5-30 p.ai.,the Conference considered a proposal that Reuters should establish news centres in Berlin, Vienna and Constantinople,in return for a subsidy of  15,000 a year.It was explained that before the War the principalnews services on the Continent had been in German and Austrianhands, and had been centred at Berlin, Vienna and Constanti-nople.    Since the War these services had passed into Frenchhands and were being conducted as channels of French propa-ganda, to the detriment of British policy, the impressionbeing created throughout the Continent that Prance was reallythe country which mattered.On behalf of the Foreign Office it was explained that,during the War, Reuters had received  5,000 a month for continental propaganda work.    On the conclusion of Peaceit was decided to bring this arrangement to an end and to substitute for it the system of wireless news now in opera-tion.The Conference was reminded that,if Reuters&apos; proposals were accepted, it would be necessary to get some control of news in Capitals like Brussels and Paris.The Conference ultimately agreed  That Mr Philip Kerr, on behalf of thePrime Minister, should request Reutersto submit a definite scheme showing,inter alia, for the period of one week,the kind of news which they propose tosupply to the foreign Press:    the scheme,when&apos; received, to be circulated to theCabinet, with a view to further consid-era t I on of the matter, J
2LTt5- (5) Wlth referenaeto-Cabinet S7 (SO),. Appendix II (5),liff OOMMTTTT^V tne--Conre.rence had under consideration the following Papersrelating to the future of the Supply and Transport CommitteeA Memorandum by Sir - Laming Worthing evans (Paper 0.P.-125J5) *A Memorandum by the Home Secretary-(Paper CP.-1394).,A Memorandum by the Pood Controller(Paper 0.-P.-1345) ,The opinion was expressed that the obvious course wouldbe to place the Supply-and - Transport. Committee and its-Sub-Committees once more under the control of the Minister ofTransport.    In favour of this course it was urged that, ofthe three possible strikes which could affect deeply the life of the community (Railways, Mines, and Docks) theMinistry of Transport were intimately concerned with two;while, in the event of a miners&apos; strike-, they would also be concerned with the distribution of coal, which would be a vital question.    It was true that the present organisation was much smaller than that which had been created during thestrike in September to October, 1919, but without it theGovernment of the country would be defenceless in the eventof a large strike-.    The greater proportion of its work waswork in which the Ministry of Transport would have to advise,and it was only reasonable that that Department should havethe general control of the preparatory arrangements.    Itwould be equally extravagant, Impracticable, and politicallyunwise to create a new Department for the purpose of performsing work very similar to work already performed by theMinistry of Transport in the ordinary course, especially as such work would have to be performed by the Ministry ofTransport during a strike.    It would fee equally difficult toallow the Heads of Departments in the Ministry of transport to be responsible to another Minister as well as to theMinister of Transport. - -
2 fi 3In favour of the creation of-a -separate department for the purpose of -carrying on the work of the Supply andTransport Committee, it was urged that the offioials of theMinistry of Transport could not be -expected to carry out the extra work involved in addition to their ordinary duties;that it wotxld prejudice the Minister of Transpoz^t in the eyes of Labour if he were made responsible for work which was generally regarded as &quot;atrike-brecking&quot; work;    and that if itwere decided that the Minister of Transport should continue as Chairman of the Supply and Transport Committee and beresponsible for the Committee&apos;s work if would be necessaryfor him to be provided with additional staff.The attention of the Conference was also directed tothe Emergency Bill, which had been drafted in order to give tieGovernment the necessary powers in the event of a grave emer-gency.After considerable disciission of the questions ofprinciple involved, the Conference agreed as follows:-(a) That the Minister of Transport shouldresume the Chairmanship of the Supplyand Transport Committee, and that theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministerof Transport should     1 onoe more becomeChairman of the Supply and TransportSub-Committee:(b) That if the Minister of Transport should find extra staff to be necessary in orderto enable him to carry out efficiently theduties devolving irpon him in accordancewith decision (a) above, he should submithis p-proposals to the Chancellor of theExchequer;(c) That the Emersencv Bill should be referred&quot;for examination bp the Horne Affairs Com-?mittee. more particularly from a political point of view.(The Minijs ter of Trajnaj^prdy^oWesired that.^i&quot;^&quot;;-iToa:^^, f-nvn&apos; this dec! si on. should.
PI       11 . 2f4aK^3liOP (6) With reference 00 3ablnet 14 (20); Conclusion 1, &apos; theT^RIuES-vS^r^V^once had before the in a Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture (Paper CP.-1441) stating.that serious criticismhad.been levelled in the House of Commons against the allegedinadequacy of the inducements in the Agriculture Pill to growwheat at. home.    The Minister of Agriculture was unwilling torecommend that the basio minimum prices specified in Clause 2(1)  of the Bill should be increased, but, in view of the .serious and progressive shrinkage of acreage under wheat, he recommonded that the suggestion.favoured by the Royal Commis-sipn, that farmers should be allowed the free play of themarket above the minimum guarantee, should be conceded, andthat the maximum prices already announced for home-grown wheat, vi3., 95/- for tho crop of 1920 and 100/- for the crop of 1921,. should be&apos; cancelled.&quot;&apos;: - .    ranch of the balance ofsat harvest- It was pointed out that/the home-grown wheat harvestedin 1919,   .  in     j   was now .    in the hands of dealers and speculators,and that the removal of the maximum price would simply putmoney into the pockets of those persons and would create a grievance in the mind of the farmer.In these circumstances the Minister of Agriculturesaid that he did not press his proposal so far as the wheatharvested in 1930 was concerned,[eat harvest- It was generally agreed that,  in the event of a world-shortage of wheat next&apos; year, the English farmer will eitherexpec4&quot; to get the average market price of imported wheat orwill still further reduce his acreage under that crop. If,as seems probable, there is a substantial increase of pricenext autumn, the loaf can only be kept at 1/- by increasing-the Breads Subsidy to  87,000,000 .per annum.With regard to the anticipated shortage,it was pointedout that -Sir Auckland. Geddes had recently reported that theUnited States would have little surplus to export, and thatthe Argentine was taking steps to prevent the export of wheat.On the other hand, it was stated that, the price of wheat in-7-in 3931 x
--&quot;&quot;^e-UraJ^^ .....s-$ that India,   ,   -. and Argentinehad a large exportable surplus, and that the Australian/cropswere onlv now being sown.   Any sudden announcement that theBritish, farmer was to receive the market price after this cerealyear would certainly have the effect of raising prices, andwould make it most difficult for the Pood Controller to carryout his policy of reducing food prices.    It was suggested thata possible&apos; solution might be to make a firm offer of,&apos;say,120/-S for next year&apos;s crop; such an offer would en-courage the farmer far more than the proposed removal of themaximum price.    On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthis policy might mean that the Government were paying more for home-grown wheat than for foreign wheat, and the public would, certainly regard any such proposal as a subsidy ,to the farmer.On behalf of the Treasury it was&quot; pointed out that homepurchases of wheat benefited the Exchange, while, on the otherhand, any proposal which, might have the effect of raising theprice of British wheat by 30/- or 40/- must either fall onthe consumer or must increase the subsidy paid out of theExchequer.   The Conference was reminded of the decision to limit the Bread. Subsidy to  45,000,000 per annum&apos;, on the. whole, the Treasury view was that the present difficulties were likely to continue -until every impediment to higherproduction on the part of the farmer was removed.The Conference ultimately agreed  That no maximum should be imposed by the-Government upon the price of home-grown- wheat - harvested, in 1931.3* Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 14, 1920.
