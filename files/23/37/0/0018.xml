IrIATICo 1.      With reference &quot;to Cabinet 18(19) Minute 5. in viewof the expected arrival the same evening of SignorIHitti and Signor Scialoja, the Italian President tothe Council and Foreign. Minister, the Conference hada short diecussidn on the subject if Fiume and the adriatic,, which was adjourned until the Prime minister had seen Signor Nitti.MS TURKISH     2.     The Conference had before them the followingPACE TREATY.documents relating to the Treety of Peace with Turkey:-Memoranda by the Secretary of State for India,-.(CP. 326&apos; and CP.. 382)..Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,.(CP.. 342).-Memorandum by the Seoretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP. 375).-General agreement was expressed with the followingfour principles sot forth in M. Berthslot&apos;s note of the12th December, 1919 (Page 5 of CP. 375):-(l)    Turkish militarism^ like Prussian militarism,must be crushed,.(2)    The custody of the Straits, fom the black sea to the Mediterranean, to be entrusted toan international organisation.which shalleffectively secure their neutrality and free passage.(3)    The Armenians to be freed from Turkishdomination,(4)    The Arab and Syrian populations not to be handed back to the domination of tho Turk.The general line of negotiations between the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affaire- and M.Berthflot was criticised on the&quot; following grounds:    although it had been understoodthat Lord Curzon and M. Berthelot were to prepare alterna-tive plans, the report of their conference revealed onlyone plan which was to turn the Turk out of Constantinople..Further,, the Khalif was not even to be granted a residenceat Roum.   Again,, the sug,. es tion which had been put forward-1-
 by the Secretary of State for India and concurred in by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, that the Turk should remain in nominal severeignty over all the country which the Prime Minister in January 1918 declared should be his, but that we should compel him to leave the administration of Turkey in Europe to an International Commission governing on his behalf, had apparently been dismissed without any consideration. Greast stress was laid upon the effect which the expulsion of the Turk would have in India. It was asserted that secret information had been received to the effect that, from the moment this Treaty was signed, we should have for the first time a movement, comparable to the Sinn Fein movement, breaking out in India, in favour of complete separation from England. The stigma and onus of such a Peace would be upon the British Empire, a fact of which the French would take the fullest advantage; the French papers were already saying that it was now up to the French to protect the interests of Mohammedans. Attention was drawn to the following extract from one of the discussions between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. Berthelot (Page 19 of C.P. 375), "Lord Curzon said that on the assumption that something like the present proposals of the Peace Terms with Turkey were accepted by the other Allies, he hoped that the military difficulties of imposing them on Turkey would not be ignored; it would be disastrous to dictate a peace that the Allies had not the military strength to enforce:"  and the Conference was urged to consider the importance of looking at the military aspect of the question and to consider what forces and what length of time would be required to impose such a Peace. Again, the proposed Peace would not be fait accompli as it would inevitably involve further

 fighting. From the point of view of India and of the position of the British Empire as a great Mohammedan power the present proposals were the worst that had yet been suggested as they leave no free Turkey at all, the "Garten" disappears, and Santa Sofia is for the first time touched and was to become an international monument. The view was expressed that at a previous Conference it had been agreed that the Turk should be left at Constantinople with titular sovereignty, and with the Straits under an International Commission; this was precisely the kind of settlement mutatis mutandis which was put forward by the Conference itself for the administration of Adrianopole and Smyrna; why then could it not be also adopted for Constantinople? Again, nothing was said in the Foreign Office document as to what would happen in Syria. There were rumours that the French had put certain propositions to Feisal which he had either rejected or opposed. It was not clear whether the French intended virtually to annex Syria, which would be contrary to our agreement with them of November, 1918; if so, Feisal might make common cause with the Turk and eventually with the Bolsheviks. This would mean that we should have trouble in Persia, then with Feisal, then with the Bolsheviks, and finally with the Turks, if we turned them out of their Capital. It was urged that our course should be to achieve the four points cited above, with as little disturbance of the map as possible. We had destroyed Austria which would cause endless trouble, and it was disastrous to destroy Turkey also. We should tell the Turks that we intended to keep them in order but we also intended to help them. If we raze every fort along the Straits, limit the Turkish army, control Constantinople with the Sultan there under our eye, set up an International Commission and an International Police Force, the Turk must be helpless. The Sultan and/
and his Government could be much more effectively controlled if he remained at Constantinople than if he was ejected. It was stated that Sir George Lloyd, the Governor of Bombay, who had before his departure for India favoured turning the Turk out, was now of the opinion that it would be the greatest possible mistake to do this. With the exception of Colonel Wilson and Miss Bell, all Indian and Mesopotamian exports including Sir George Roos-Keppel, Sir M. O&apos;Dwyer and Lord Willingdon, shared Sir George Lloyd&apos;s view. The progressive boycott of British goods and a general refusal of all Government measures had been organnised in India to meet the contingency of this Treaty being signed.

Attention was drawn to the larger aspect of the case. The Bolsheviks had now a very powerful army, consisting of all their best troops, which had been withdrawn from the Koltchak front in order to crush Denikin, down in South Russia, and they would shortly be in touch with Turkish Nationalists. They were probably already in possession of Krasnovodsk. Every day they were making great strides towards the East, the direction of Bokhara and Afghanistan. They were carrying out a regular, scientific, and comprehensive scheme of propaganda in Central Asia against the British. We ourselves had no military forces wherewith to oppose them; in fact, at the moment, our troops were at their lowest ebb and we shortly should not have a single friend from Constantinople to China. We could not, of course stem all this by keeping the Sultan at Constantinople, but to turn him out would be to add one more spark to the spreading conflagration.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressed the view that if we wished to retain power over the Turk we should leave the Sultan in Constantinople. If we blew up the forts in the Dardanelles there would be no further 
dangerh and a single policeman on shore with a Guard-ship in the harbour would suffice to secure the Straits.   Inreply to a question, General Wilson said that&apos;there were atpresent in Constantinop ite about 13,000 or 14,000 Britishtroops and one French Division.     With the collapse of Denikin the Caspian would fall into the hands of the &apos;Bolsheviks who could then land at Snzeli and createdisturbance in North Persia.    The unrest would spread to   Afghanistan, which was already very unsettled, andalso to India which was reported to be in a more dangerousstate to-day than it had been for the last thirty years*-We had enough   troops on the spot to hold Mesopotamia and &apos;Constantinople but only just enough, and if the Kurdsjoined the Bolsheviks our position would be precarious.It was very difficult to decide where best to defendIndia., , One line of defence&apos;- might be Ba to urn-Baku, butthis would only be possible if the Turks were friendly tous.     111 military opinion was opposed to ejecting:the Turkfrom Constantinople-.It .was suggested that the Naval and Military Authoritiesshould be asxed to consider how we could make the Dardanellesand the entrance to the Black Sea secure, and whether the turk could, or could not Improvise &quot;fortifications&quot; oh the islands to prevent this..r  , It was stated, that,, in respect of the Naval- and&quot;- military measures to be taken to secure the Dardanelles, in theopinion of the Naval Authorities it would not make much,difference whether the Sultan were or were not atConstantinople.
In reply to these criticisms it was &quot;pointed out ;-(a) That it was not our fault that a 11ernaiiiinasjpiAnawere not submitted.     Mi Clemeneeau had thought it best thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. isftlt&amp;2ctshould meet and state the views of their -respective Govern-ments.     Before they mot M. Berthelot had handed to Bord Cureona paper which, to the latter&apos;s surprise, was. not a basis ofdiscussion but a complete surrender to our view;(b) That, as regards the Vatican solution, this hadbeen put forward for discussion at the recent Anglo-french conference, but it had been absolutely ruled out by M.Clemenceauwho declared that one &quot;Pope&quot; was enough;(c) In regard to Santa Sofia,  there was no greatobjection td leaving this as a Mosque, although the 470 years it had been a Mosque were more than balanced by the 920 yearsof Christian occupation;(d) lord Curzon and M. Berthelot had not been authorisedto discuss Syria.     Officially we had not been informed of what had passed in.Paris;    but we had received unofficialreports that the French proposed a virtually French protector-ate, which was strongly opposed by Feisal, who had consultedLord Curzon as to the line he should take and had been advised by him to consult the Peace Conference.     Feisal had giveninnumerable assurances to us that in no oase would he intriguewith the Turk, but that he would accept whatever solution we suggested that was consistent with hia honour.(e) It was not correct to say that we propose to abolish a free. Turkey in Asia Minor and place the Turksin manacles.    The proposal of the Conference was to givethe Turk Anatolia as far as Cilicia in the South, and up tothe boundaries of Armenia to the Horth-Bast.   Moreover it v^ashoped to get the Creeks out of Smyrna by giving them oompensa-tion in Thrace.     The Turkish exasperation was mainly due tothis Creek occupation of Smyrna, and the desire of Lord Curzonand M. Ssrthelot was that Anatolia, free from any mandate and   *free//-6- &quot;   &apos;
free   from Greeks and Italians,  should be in Turkish hands.    Itwas pointed out that there were good reasons for the&apos;much,criticised financial control;    there were the interests to beconsidered of the bond-holders of the pr&apos;e-^war---Ot&quot;t^^man^^-d^b^ti&apos;^^rvenafter allowing for the portion of the interest tc be paid bythe occupied territories,  3 . million, sterling would have to bereceived annually from Turkey.-   Unless we took control of theTurkish finances, how would we possibly maintain the cost ofthe armies of occupation ?   Moreover the trade of the BritishEmpire would be lost if Turkey fell into chaos.    cur tradebefore the war with Turkey was 26% as against Germany&apos;s 14^ andFrancetelS^:    in other words, British commercial interestshad been nearly twice those of any other Power.   Loss of tradein Anatolia meant thousands out of work in Manchester.    It wassuggested that although there might be considerable agitation in India over the Turkish Treaty, this agitation was a&apos; fic-*titious one, was organised by familiar methods and would be short-lived.   As regards the various experts quoted it waspointed out that,  besides Col. Wilson, and Miss Bell,  two ex-Viceroys, Lord curzo.n and Lord Hardinge .with the combined experi-ence of twelve years of India,were of the opposite view; and theywere supported by Admirals calthorpe and de Robeck, who had represented this country at Constantinople, and had repeatedlyexpressedfoeir considered opinion.that the Turk should go.    Thiswas also the view of the two Foreign Office officials, now atConstantinople, Mr. Hohler and Mr. Ryan (dragom m-f&amp;r 30 years in Turkey and suspected of pro-Turk sympathy)&apos; and an extractfrom a dispatch from Mr. Hohler was read to the Conference inwhich the following words occurred;    &quot;a errtain lesson to be derived from history is that the Turk is incapable of governinghimself much less other nations ..... There is a great risk ofover estimating Moslem feeling,&quot;   The Turk is a born hereditaryintriguer,  and for centuries had been a blight and curse to europe; and it was urged that a unique opportunity now presenteditself for removing a festering sore.    Egyptian expert     opinion was also stated to be divided. .
(Col. w&quot;ilson&apos;s telegram No. .941 of the 23rd-January, 1919was read to the Conference, emphasising the importance *fej-ecting the Ottoman Government from Constantinaple..Jt was pointed out that the then Commander-in-Chief,General Marshall had concurred in this view, and it was stated that Col. Wilson adhered to-day to the opinion hethen expressed.)In respect of the military arguments,  it was pointed outthat the Military problem might be reduced in proportion, butit would not be. solved by leaving the Turk in Constantinople.The problem was Mustapha Kemal, who was a nationalist and snappedhis fingers at the Sultan.    What had to be faped in the futurewas a nationalist movement,   was that menace made greater $r &apos;less by leaving the T.urk in Constantinople ?   This was a dis-putable point.   If he were left there, the whole Moslem world would say that he had triumphed after all.   Twice had the Alliescome to a decision to eject the Turk.   -First early in the war when Russia was to go there.   This, when published by Kerenskydid not i:aise a flutter.   The second occasion was in 1917 atan internaticnal Conference when Mr. Balfour wrste a dispatchtft the United states restating the whole position, and urging the ejection of the Turk.(In regard to the reference which had been made te theprime Ministers statement on war aims,  the fallowingextract was read out from the &quot;Minutes bf the Meeting yf the .,  War oabinet held on Fanuary 3rd 1918, War Cabinet 313,Minute 3.&quot;The prime Minister urged that the War Cabinet shouldnet neglect to consider the drafts from the point ofview of their value as a counter offensive to theGerman peace move .....   It was essential that.this,statement should be regarded rather as a war movethan as a peace move.....    Yftiat kept the Turks fighting was the fear of dismemberment and of losing Constantinople.If they knew, they would retain the Turkish part oftheir empire,  they might be much less inclined to fight
It .was suggested that if the Turks were left at Constantinople there would be s potential head of the Pan-Turanianmovement in the old sacred city, that tha^t movement would bethereby invested with a high significance and the dangersenvisaged by the t!. I ,&apos;G.S . would be accentuated.On the other hand, the Importance of having Turkey under control was again strongly urged.    It was pointed out that theForeign Office document would leave no Turkey at all.    Howeverif we deccided to  accept it we should be in a much better position to enforce it if we had the Turk under supervisionat Constantinople.    It was suggested thatM.Clemenceau hadin mind, if there were International,control of the Straits,the other Powers would gradually get tired of it and theFrench would take the opportunity to pose as the friends of Islam while we should appear -as the enemies off Turkey,The control of the Straits was absolutely necessary and thiswould&apos;be&quot; easier if we had.. Constantinople...    The. present.Government of India..was unanimous that it would be disastrous to remove the Sultan.    The-.same- view was.held in Egypt and field   Marshal Allenby had stated that his position would be rendered most difficult if the Turk were&apos;ejected from hisCapital.    Similarly in Mesopotamia if we alienated the Turkour work would, become impossible.It was suggested that it Was &quot;not correct to ensure that&apos;off icial opinion was unanimous oh this question, as., manyEgyptian&apos; officials were known to advocate turning the Turkout.- rt -&apos;&apos;&quot;-&apos;-&apos; .It was recalled that-&apos;*fr.;Balfour.- had &quot;never swervedfrom the view that the Turk ought to go.    Supposing the Turkwere left in Constantinople &quot;with, a Guard-ship, permanentlystationed- there, it was possible that some&apos; power &apos;would
start intriguing.    The contingency of a hostile Russia could not be ignored, particularly in view, of the probable victory of the bolshevists, and we had certainly done air b? st to&apos; estrange the bolshevists who had -greater reason to. hate us than any othorPower; but a victorious Bolshevist Russia would be infinitely,more powerful with the Turk at Constantinople.    In the event of warwith Russia and an attack on India and Persia the first effort would be to block.the Bosphorus.    Surely a Russia in alliance-with turkey and perhaps Germany would, find some means to achieve this.By sending Marshal von Bieberstein, a clever diplomatist, to turkey Germany had before the v*ar entirely superseded British Influ-ence at Constantinople.    This did not support the view that any permanent and reliable friendship could be made with the Turks.-Who were the Turks?     Often indifferent and unreliable people likeTallat and Enver who had somehow forced their way to the top.The Allies would be regarded as rather &quot;soft&quot; for after being soseverely let d^wn by the Turks we said &quot;We will trust you now and allow you to remain,&quot;      If the Sultan were removed from Constant!-nople it was pointed out that there would be an InternationalArmy which would command&apos;the Straits.&quot;   It was suggested, however,that if the Turk.were turned out of Constantinople he should begiven a greater measure of independence than wes contemplated atpresent; and that the  &quot;roper no1Icy was to leave the Turk the samemeasure of freedom and - independence as Persia now enjoyed.As regards the suggestion, that the Turks might&apos;refuse to sign the Treaty,  it was pointed out that the Allies, in order to enforce the Treaty, had no necessity to advance into Turkey, since they were already In occupation of all the districts to bo wrested from the turk, a..g, Constantinople, Smyrna&apos;, Cilicla, Syria, etc. they could&apos;even, moreover, occupy Brusa or refuse to evacuate Konia.    It.was suggested that the Moslems were not likely to p lay the Bolshe-vist game as their mentality was entirely different,    In any event,ho&apos; was not more likely to unite with the Bolshevists because the turk remained in Constantinople,
On the contrary, with the Turk in Constantinople, the bolshevist would have an overwhelming inducement to conquerthat city.     If the Turks were r ele gated to Anatolia, the bolshevists would get little by attempting to co-operate, withthem, owing to the Indifferent communications&apos;. &apos;  A suggestion was made that whether the Sultan was at Constantinople or not,there would he an inter&apos;national force&apos; guarding the Straita,and it would be better that the Sultan should be allowed.to stay in Constantinople where he would be more immediately underthe control of that force.The Conference was reminded that the policy of the british delegates in Paris had always been to get the United states to undertake the policing and control&quot;of the Straits and constantinople.     If the United States now joined the proposed international Commission, it would mean that Bussia would not attack unless she lib ended to&apos; wage&apos; recklese war upon the whole -world.The view was put forward that at the time when lord curzon was Viceroy of India, and in the early days of lord hardinge&apos;s tenure it would   have been most unlikely that toeject the Turk from Constantinople would have raised anyreally formidable agitation.     Since those days, however, anominous change of feeling had come over the inhabitants ofIndia largely owing to the reversal of Lord Curzon.1 s policy.We could no longer rely   upon Indians public opinion and support.     The &quot;weak policy of the Indian Government in theearly days of the war had had a bad effect.     The feeling ofunreatvand hostility to Great Britain in India could, however,be mitigated by letting the Sultan remain in Constantinoplewith an international force controlling the Straita....&quot;    &apos;-M^,-11- ,
It was agreed that it was desirable that theMilitary and laval 3..perts should examine ,without delay what military and naval forces would be required to keep, the Straits opbn.After some discussion as to the terms ofreference to the Experts it was deoidea:-. .(a) That the C.I.G.S. in conjunction with-  the First Sea Lord assuming that the:Turk remains, in Oohstantinoplc should consider and report with.the least possible delay what force, naval and.military is necessary to guarantee the freedom of the  traits, and wherethat force should be placed, thealternative suppositions being thatthe enemy consisted of(i) Russians,(ii) Russiahd and Germans combined.(The First Lord undertook tc notify the First Sea Lord of the above decision)(b) That; the Secretary should circulate tothe Cabiact, copies of the memorandum which Mr. Balfour prepared for theUnited States on the subject of theTurkish Peace..2 Whitonall.
