^mSFTrrm^ (\) &quot;Tho- Tburu&amp;i^Lar of the Ex^ihe*rue* -said that-, in the^russia. &amp;ourae &apos;of the converted-ew-^vtAon with K. Krassin at 10, Downingtssian Gold; Street, the previous Monday,. M. Kras3in had made a proposal that Russian gold should form the basis of the resumption oftrade with his country.   This proposal, however, raisedsomewhat complicated questions, the chief difficulty in the,   matter lying in the fact that M..Krassin and his colleagues&quot;could not show an absolutely secure, title to this gold.Mr Chamberlain said he had. accordingly circulated to hiscolleagues that afternoon a Paper prepared;in the Treasury(0..P.-1594. (See Appendix I)  on the subject.   The view held,   .   .  by his Department was that g^ld held by. the Bolsheviks couldnot be made the basis of credits in the same way ae  old towhich an absolutely good title could be shown, and the Bankof England would almost certainly refuse to accept and pay for such gold.    It was, however, an essential part of the goldpolicy which we had adopted that all gold should, for thepresent, be sold to the Bank of England, and the surplus goldof the Joint Stock Banks had /been handed over to the Bankmanian        in accordance with this policy.   Mr Chamberlain said he wishedd. ,   -   ,to raise another paint, which had not been touched upon inthe Treasury Paper.    There was a certain amount ef goldbelonging, to Roumania, &apos;now lying in Moscow., When Roumaniacame into the War we guaranteed this gold to her, but when,she made Peace we withdrew this guarantee, but we substitutedfor it a promise that-we would use our good offices to have it returned to her in the course of time.   This suppliedanother reason why we should not touch the Russian gfld.-Some of. the aaost important people in the City were convincedthat,if Russian gold were shipped to this country, a large ;number of claims would at once be taken to the Law. Courtsby private creditors of Russia,The Opinion of the Law Officers-, on the other handi&apos;Refl Appendix IIh which was based upon the. hypothesis thatthis gold was the property of the Russian Government, wasthat no foreign Government, past or present, is amenable to
2d? *%0 3any form of process in the English Courts, and there did notappear to he any legal method by which creditors of the vformer Russian Government could either establish their -claims^or enforce them against property alleged to belong to thatGovernment,A general discussion followed, in the course of whichthe view was expressed that a common-sense policy would be toget some firm or firms to act on behalf of the British Govern-ment, in which case the difficulties apprehended by theTreasury -would not arise.      It was suggested that Russian goldshould not bo shipped to England, but might bo deposited witha neutral Government, and that that Government should givetho Bank of England credit for it.     If it was deposited, say,in Copenhagen, and held ...&quot;or the benefit of British tra&amp;o withRussia, it could not be attached.    In regard to this suggest-ion it was pointed out that it was hardly becoming for HisMajestyxs Government to base trado transactions upon golddeposited in a neutral county.Reference was then made to a statement which had ap-appeared in several newspapers to the effect that commodities from England were not to bo paid for in gold, but by barterin goods.    This statement, it z&amp;a explained, ;.was almost certainly inspired from 2aris.    The Prench claimed preferen-tial rights in any assets which might be in the hands of theBolsheviks, and the;/ were considerably disturbed at thecourse they understood the negotiations with H. Krassin to beHeHtiLag^     They..did not wish themselves to have any commercewith the Bolsheviks, and &amp;t tho enaa time they resented theidea that we should be rc-starting our trade and reaping theprincipal benefits by being the first in the field.There was general agreement that it was highly import-ant to got trade with Russia re-started as soon as possibleThe Cabinet had been informed that morning by the Presidentof the Board of $*$de that British trade was inclined to sagand it was essential to open up new channels of business.
On .the other hand,  it would he very damaging to Great Britainpolitically if she alone were to resume commercial relationswith the Bolsheviks.    There was no doubt that Italy wasvery anxious indeed to reopen her trade with Russia.   &quot;In this connection the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs stated that he had sounded informally the japanese and Italian Charges d&apos;Affaires on. the subject of their Govern-ments being represented in the negotiations now proceeding with M. Krassin.    Both these officials had replied that theymust refer the question to thei.- Governments.    Lord Curzonsuggested that perhaps it might be advisable for him to sound the American Ambassador as to the views of the WashingtonGovernment.It was explained that the &quot;Barter Association&quot; of theUnited States had been negotiating with M, Kraasin in respectof railway material and rollingstoek for Esthonia, for which russia had been prepared to deposit  1-, 000,000 in England andanother  1,000,000 in the United States.    The idea had beenthat the United States should supply the material through us.The Americans, .however, would not touch the transaction.It was agreed that the moral advantage of the presenceof Allied representatives at the conversations with M. Krassinwould be very considerable.As regards the suggestion that trade with Russia shouldbe carried on not by the British government but throughprivate traders, it was stated that such traders would oertain-ly-not be prepared to do any business unless they were assured that the gold to pay for the commodities supplied by them would be shipped to this country and would not he attached on arrival here..    If an assurance oould be given that the goldon reaching England could not. be attached either by theBritish Government or by ether British creditors, there wouldcertainly be keen competition among business men to reopentrade.    As an alternative, to shipping gold to England, it-was suggested that traders should have letters of credit on
&apos;-neutral banks in- which the gold might )?e deposited; -their interests would thus be safeguarded,  as those banks &quot;would make no payment untilthe goods were actually shipped;The Attorney-Genera,!: then re-stated . the view of-the Law Officers,that gold which was the property of a--de facto foreign Governmentwere, not- officially rcc-ognised. - The Russian&apos;Governmtnt &apos;        A.   .could&quot;.hot be attached,  even if that Government/had undoubtedly requisi-tioned or acquired in some -way this gold, but even if&quot; they had not a secure title to it he did not see how litigation could be initiatedto lay hands upon it.Some-doubt was expressed as to whether the Bolshevist Governmentwould be disposed to acknowledge their indebtedness to certain Britishsubjects.who had invested in railway shares and various bonds issuedor guaranteed by the old Russian government or whose property had beenseized or nationalised by the Bolsheviks.    It was stated that Mr.peters, of the Overseas Trade Department, was of opinion that m.Krassin.could be induced to make some acknowledgment of this indebted-ness,  and that it was the unanimous view of business men in the Citythat an essential preliminary to&apos; the resumption of trade was that theSoviet Government should recognise their obligations.   It was suggestedthat, in the next conversation with m. Kras3in, he sfcould be asked toobtain from his Government some assurance in respect of this.    In thisconnection it was-pointed out that it was desirable that the BritishGovernment should make it clear that we also recognised the obliga-tions of Russia to the Prench.    It was agreed that it was most unfortunate-nate that there should be any difference of opinion with.our Alliesrespecting the renewal of trade relations.    It was explained that theattitude of the French Government Was that all that had been decided at san Remo was that trade -relations should he resumed with the Soviets;but the prench felt that we were going beyond this, as our meetings with m. Krass-in were not confined to experts but were attended bydiplomatists, and that questions of policy,  as apart from trade, were discussed,    It was desirable to remove with the least possible delayany source of friction.
oaatlcLiege s.and misunderstanding with the Prench, and it was suggestedthat, as. it wag impossible for the two Prime Ministers tomeet and have a frank discussion, it might be advisable thatMr Lloyd George should send a personal communication to M.Millerand, explaining exactly our position, and once moreinviting French co-operation.    The object of the conversa-tions with M. Krassin w&amp;sb:  to disocver what impedimentsexisted in the resumption of trade, and the host way of removing those impediments.    The difference between ourselves and the Prench was partly due to this,- that they envisagedcommercial obstacles only, whereas we perceived politicalobstacles.   Directly, however, the French took part in these conversations, whether by a diplomatic representative er bypurely technical experts, they wese bound to be confrontedsooner o- later with identical  difficulties with ourselves.The French resentment at the line we were taking was partly due to their belief that the British Ministers had met M.Krassin without waiting for the reply of the French Governmentto the communication we had made to them on the subject.This, of course, was not true.Reference was then made to the following stipulationswhich had been made by U. Krassin at the conversation on theprevious Monday&quot;Commercial  representatives must have the right and the practical facilities freely to coitsrauni-oate with their own and other countries by post,telegraph and wireless, by means of cypher, with - .preferential rights over the correspondence of -private persons.  ...... The work of commercialrepresentatives absolutely required that docu-ments, passports, powers-of-attorney, agreement-s,etc., signed or confirmed by the official authori-ties of one country should be recognised as legallyvalid in the other country, since no transactionsare possible without the fulfilment of this con-dition.    It was equally necessary to have theright to vindicate one&apos;s interests in the Courts.&quot;It was pointed out that M. Krassin and his colleaguescould hardly be expe-voted to be accorded complete aipbassadorialprivileges^ and it was suggested that these stipulations^should be carefully examined by the Foreign Office and the
Board of Trade in consultation, and that the Prime minister should&apos;&quot;&quot;be-aocuajLrrted- with their views before he next met M.^Zrassinu.Some further discussion followed,  in the course of whichit was explained that the country principally interested inthe resumption of trade with Russia was Great Britain, becauseof her enormous Imperial and commercial interests there.    Italycame next, chiefly because of her shortage of food.    France, onthe other hand, was not so closely concerned, and the Frenchdoubted whether they stood to gain muah by such resumption, andwere inclined to think that they even stood to lose a good deal.It was generally agreed  (a) That it was highly important for the BritishEmpire that trade with Russia should be resumed withas little delay as possible;(b) That Russian gold would at the outset have to formthe basis of this trade, and that the Board of trade should take up this question in consultation with theTreasury, with special reference to the questioncf permitting gold tu be shipped to this country:(c) That it was desirable that business should boresumed by private traders, and that the BritishGovernment should not be directly concerned in thematter;(d) That it would be preferable that Great britain should not stand alone in re-scarting trade with the soviets, and that endeavours mast be made to inducecur Allies to participate.    In view of this, theSecretary of i/tate for Foreign Affairs shouldervieavowr to secure the attecpaaee of the italian ambassador, or other representative of the ItalianGovernment at any rate, and of the Japanese Ambassador,if possible, when the Conversation with M. Erassinwas resumed:(e) As regards the various stipulations submitted by M.immunities to the representatives, the Board cf Trade&apos;and Foreign Office should, consider jointly what reply should be made to M. Zrassin&apos;s proposals;(f) That the next Conversation with M. Zrassin shouldtake place at 10,Downing street, on Monday next,June 7, 192.0, at 5,30 p.m. ;
(g) That at the next nee &quot;ting with M.  ra^sijx &quot;thai lafrfcer.--.should      asked, t*o ascertain whe*fch,er or not the.Soviet:. GxrTBTixsBB-ia.il were prepared to recognise, anyobligations on their part in respect of such foreign,debts as. might have been incurred under the oldregime, and. alse in respect of claims arising fromnationalisation of property of foreigners under thepresent regime.The Board of Trade should prepare, a statement which the  Prime Minister could., make to M. Krassin on thissubject.(h) That. Mr.. E,..F,Wise should be responsible for collectingthe materials from, the Departments concerned, for a.comprehensive statement to he made by the PrimeMinister&apos; at:the meeting with M. Xrasein on thefollowing Monday afternoon..efields. It was stated that the Soviet Delagaii&amp;n in england had raised the question of sweeping the minefields outsidePetrogfad, and had enquired whether ihife should be, done by theBritish or Russian minesweepers^It was agreed that the workr if carried out by the russia Soviet Government, would probably be most inefficientlydone, and it was decided - ..To refer the matter to the Admiralty, who shouldbe asked to communicate their views to thePrime Minister before the meeting an Monday afternoon.
OF (S).     The .,.Con e-renrp, lad- -before- them -a- Memorandum, by$ST (R33TRIC- the Minister of Health (C.P,1374) relative to theOSSP EXTENSION question of the extension to shops and business premisess--:cps andESS PREMISES, of the principles contained in tho Rent (Restriction)Bill,    It was explained that the Home Affairs Committeehad decided to confine the Bill to dwelling housesfollowing the recommendation of Lord Salisbury^Committees    It was, however, certain that an effort would be made in tho House of Commons to extend theprinciples of the Bill to shops and business premises,since the tenants of such premises were sufferingfrom similar grievances to those of the small house-holders     While it was true that the business man canas a rule recoup himself from his customers for any additional charges imposed by his landlord there was atthe present time a wide spread feeling that the tenants&quot;of business promises had legitimate grievances forwhich seme solution should be found and that theGovernment policy on the matter should be announced.The Minister of Health proposed that the veryintricate and controversial question involved should - .,,be rcforrod for examination to a Select Committee ofthe House of Commons and that the Landlord an6^Tenant Bill drafted for the Ministry of reconstruction in 1918 should be read a second time and referred tothat Committee or to a Joint Committee of the twoHouseso    To aeet the immediate difficulty it was proposed that pending the report of the Select Committeethe tenancy of all business premises --(and perhaps of/all dwelling houses not covered in the Bill) expiring  -on and after (say) 25th March last   should be extended or 24th June nextupon tho same ^terms and conditions as the expiringtenancy for a /*&quot;period
period ending or T)december 25th, 1921, subject -(a) to an increase of rent not exceeding 50$ nt the rent reserved by the expiring tenancy, and(b) to an appeal to the Court (defined as in    -8.30(3) of the Housing Act 1919) v?ho mightdetermine the tenancy &quot;on th? ground that&apos;   the landlord requires possession of theproperty in order to carry out seme schemeof reconstruction or improvement,desirable in the public interest&quot; subject possibly to the payment of compensation for. loss of goodwill, etc.It was generally agreed that while the necessities ef the case had forced the Governmentto pass legislation protecting the small householderthe whole principle of the Rent Restriction legislation was vioicus, economically unsound and was responsible to a substantial degree for the present housingdifficulties.    To extend the principles of this legislation to shops and business premises would bring the dead hand of the State ?n to the commerciallife of the community and would tend to paralyse tradeand business.    The general feeling was that if theposition was carefully ertj^ined to the House ofCommons there was very little risk of the House,carrying amendments extending the principle of theBill.      &quot;.ith regard to the proposed temporary expedientIt was pointed out if machinery was onoe set up for fixing rents It - ould be most difficult to go back onthat procedure.Tha attention of the Confereaoo was drawn to thevery real permanent grievance suffered by the tenants of business premises.   j?or example, a tenant may be forced to take a 14 years1 lease.    He then proceedsto oreate a vrlu*le goodwill and at the expiration of the tenancy the landlord takes advantage of theposition to exact a ..sucessive terms for the renewal
leas-ehold shop keeper is apt to make very exorl^tajal^e^aims in respect&apos; of int. or   orence with his frontage.Ultimately, the Conferonoe agroed(l)    That the Government should oppose anyoxtension of the principles of the rent (Restriction) Bill to shops or business premises:(2)    that a Select Committee of the Houseof Commons should he set up to considerthe grievance referred to in the last paragraph and that the terns of reference of that Committae should &quot;be drafted bythe Minister of Health and submitted in due course to the nome Affairs Committee for.consideration.-Whitehall Gardens..

APPENDIX IRESUHPTIOE OE TRADE *7ITH RUSSIA.RUSSIAN GOLD.ITo t e by . t h o Cha no nl 1 cxm f the Exchequer covering: Mono ran dun&quot;&quot;&quot;by7Mr,&quot;&apos;B.  P. Blackott. &apos; &apos;I circulate a Koto by the Controller of Finance on thissubject.      It seems to no both wrong and impracticable to make this geld the basis of trade with Russia.(Initialled)    A. C.Treasury,  S.T.1,2nd June, 1920.Mono ran dura b&quot;P:r.--3. P. Blackett..With reference to CP. 1349, 1342 and 1369 on tho resump-tion of trade with Russia-/: the proposal that Russian gold should be .imported into this country direct or from Esthonia or should beused as the basis of credits in this country, raises somewhatcomplicated questions, and I wish to sot forth briefly the main considerations regarding the natter from the point of view of thefinancial situation in this country.The chief difficulty in the matter lies in tho fact thatM* Erassin and his colleagues cannot show an absolutely secure title to this gold.      There can bo no doubt that looking at the matterbroadly it represents stolen property so long as the Bolshevik GoTern-no nt is unrecognised.      It is .not certain whether or not the creditors of Russia in this country could effectively onbargo suchSold cr obtain an injunction from the Courts to prevent it being dealt with.     But it is -known that many of the most Important&quot;people in the City have been advised that such proceedings might be successful, and that the moment any Russian gold arrives, they willattempt to establish their claim to it.   The Bank of England is alarge holder of frozen Russian Bills (as agent for the British
Government) and it would&apos; be oound to protect itc interests (andours) by folio-wing suit as soon as other -creditors tried toembargo the gold.     It follows that such, gold cannot properly bemade the basis of .-credits in tho same way as gold to which an absolutely good title can be shown;    and what is of more immediat-e,importance,  it follows that the Bank of England will refuse toaccept and pay for such gold.     It is however an essential part ofthe gold policy which we hare adopted, that all gold should for thepresent at any rate be sold to the Bank of England.     The surnlustogold of the Joint Stock Banks has now been handed over/theBank of England in accordance with this policy.    In short, we feel bound to discourage M.. Krassin from making payment or obtaining -credit with this gold, until he can show an absolutely safe title to it and until it  can safely be token by tho Bank of England?It should be explained that the proposal in paragraph1 cf CP. 134-9 that the gold might be located in a neutral stateand credits opened in respect of it in this country,  is open to just as strong financial objections as the inport of gold intothis country.     Under this scheme &quot;banks would open credits againstgold abroad, which we deprecate in any case, and in particularwhen it is gold which, could not safely be brought to this country.As regards the machinery by means of. which we candiscourage the use of this gold, although the import of gold is notin any way restricted, we have two effective weapons-:-1. few prudent bankers will accept Russian goldwithout some form of indemnity or promise of support from us.2.     t-bvo. gold cannot- be re-exported without licence sothat its price is the home price of 8^s, a fineounce instead of the world price of 106s,
&quot;Alf. tblsrmaln ^h^crtlsra. cannot&apos; xr rv^ercrome (-and. theenly obvious way to overcome it is to grant de facto recog-nition to the Bolshevik Government in seme form or other)there remains the&apos;further difficulty that the Treasury and--the Bank rf England are strongly opposed to. granting re-export licences to casual imports *f gold.    Contracts havebeen made with seuth and West Africa and the Congo for the shipment tc this country of the whole af their rutput,  and any decision to grant re-export licences for casual imports of goldwould go far to influence the producers to terminate these contracts,    in addition,  it would be almost impossible toexercise effective control over &quot;casual&quot; gold exported under1 i c en c e.Geld anywhere in sorthem iiurope finds extraordinaryphysical difficulty in getting away except to or through London,sc that the refusal of an export licence is a very effectiveweapon.    The Governor if the Bank holds that if we continue torefuse casual licences for export   the gold must - ultimatelycome here at the Mint price (85s. per fine sz.).    If other difficulties are disposed of some arrangement must doubtless be made to meet the difficulty as to export licences,    proba-bly the most advantageous would be to insist on the gold being sold to the British Government at a price somewhere betweenthe Mint price and the market price, and if we so choose weare probably in a position to dictate the price.But it is obvious that until the legal title of theBolshevik Government is established beyond doubt, no one is safe in dealing-with the gold at all.(intld.)

AEPBTSMX II.The Prime Minister desires&apos; to ho advu-s-odLwhethercreditors of the former Russian Gbwrrrnmont would he ont-iirlecL^to attach gold which might ho sent to&apos;this country aither hythe Soviet Government or hy its agents.(a)    if the gold were placed on deposit withhanks in this country against which credits would he opened hy the Russian Cc-operative societies,  or some agents of the SovietGovernment, for payment of purchases to he made,(h)    if the gold were handed over to a vendor in payment of goods still to he delivered or sohanded over in payment of an existing debt,It is said that some of the gold is in the form ofbar gold marked in such a way as to bo identifiable as theproperty of the former Russian Government.Advice is   also sought whether,  if tho gold weredeposited in a foreign bank and that bank opened credits inLondon, the credits so opened could be attached by cieditorsof the former Russian Government.In *ur opinion all these questions are to be anwered inamenable to any form of process in the English Courts, and we donot think that there is any legal method by which creditors ofthe former Russian Government  could either establish their claimror enforce them against property alleged to belong to thatGovernment.29th May. 1920.Opinion.tho negative.o foreign Government, past or present,  islet J&apos;(Initialled)     G.
