gpA (1)        The Conference was informed that Signor Nitti hadINFERENCE.&apos; . . -   ttmade a request for a postponement of the f or the omi rig C oh-fererice at Spa until July 15th.    This request was based onthe ground of the Parliamentary difficulties which SignorNitti was  experiencing.    A similar request had also beenmade to M. &quot;Miller and, who was, however,  opposed to anypostponement, his opposition being attributable, no doubt,to the criticism which would arise in France if the SpaConference were postponed.The opinion.was,expressed that representation of boththe Prench and the Italians at the Spa Conference&apos; &quot;was essen-tial-.    So far, &apos;Signor&apos; Nitti had played a very useful part - ..&apos;and had placed this country in,the position of being amoderator between tv:6 extreme views, represented by theItalians,  on the one hand,  and the French&apos;on the. other.&apos;&apos;. If the. Conference; were hold without the Italians, we shouldface France alone,  and.&apos;any difference of&apos;. opinion with the, French would be accentuated.    It was essential, therefore,that Signor Nitti should be present at Spa..    On the other side,  it must, he remembered that since, the San Remo Con-ference M. Millerand had behaved very well and had. loyallygiven his support to the. carrying, out of..the decisions ofthat Conference.    It would,  therefore, be difficult topress M. Millerand,  in spite of his objections, to yield to signor Nitti&apos;s request for a postponement.The Conference accordingly agreed  (a)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should communicate with the french ambassador and request him to&quot;inform his-   . Government that the vie^s of Kis Majesty.&apos;s...   . Government were; as follows. - .   . ... (i)  That His Majesty&apos;s- Government entirelyagreed&apos;that it was&apos;most undesirable to postpone the Spa Conference:(ii)  That His Majesty&apos;s Government were,however, of opinion that Signor Nitti&apos;.s
presence at the Conference was indis-pensable: and( iii&apos;)  That HIS Maj.esty&apos; s Government were putting pressure on Signer-&apos;;Nlttlto be present at&apos; the Conference atSpa,- which should be held oh the date at present ft/ ed for it,- viz .    June21st. next.&quot;.. Hi s Ma j e s ty1 s Governmentwould suggest;- that&apos; M. - Miller and shouldalso put pressure onSignor Nitti.(b)    That.a personal telegram to Signor Pittishould be despatched by the Prime Minister,stating that M. Millerand was understood to bevery opposed to any postponement of the SpaConference,, for political reasonsandthat,.. In- view of the&apos; loyalty which M - Mille-rand had displayed in supporting the deci-sicns of the  an Rerno Conference, it wouldbe very difficult&apos;for His Majesty1s Govern-ment to press him to agree to a postponement of the Spa Conference.-  The telegram shouldalso make a strong appeal to Signor Nittito be present at the Spa Conference on thedate at present arranged,  viz.,  June 21st, nest.ELI.        (2).      With reference to-Cabinet 30 (20), Conclusion S,and tc the decision that the War Office should carry outthe military, dispositions they proposed for a concentrationat Kasvin of the military forces in North Persia,  theConference were informed that the question had been raised whether, if the Eolsi.eviks evacuated Enzeli,  the british forces should re-occupy.that place..The Conference agreed --That it would not be ir/ac cor dance withthe decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet 30 -(20), Conclusion 3)  taken on May 21st,for British forces to re-occupy.Enzeliiri the event of evacuation by. theBolsheviks.
/ -. -&apos; -       &apos;   . -&apos;-\&apos;iqTIATIOES 3o  (i ) The Conference- were&apos;- informed that M.JCr&amp;ssln, a1      s &apos; -     member of the Soviet Executive, had arrived in this ^presentation -of His Majesty*s country in order to conduct negotiations regarding theGovernment at . : &quot;meetings with      reopening of trado with Russia,   M,Krassin had ..stipUrrI,Erassin. ; -&apos;--...   -latod that ho should see the Prime Ministor and the &apos;- - .- &apos;Secretary of State for Foreign.Affairs, hut the quest!arose as&apos; to who should he.nominated to conduct.the de-tailed negotiations with M. Erassin,The Conferenoe agreed --. ; -That, the detailed negotiations regarding the - -reopening of trade with Russia, should heconducted on behalf of His Majesty&quot;s Covern-ment by the following :- \The President of the Board of Trade,        &apos;&apos;-Sir Laming -Worthington Evans, and representatives - of the Treasury and.the Ministry of Food,General Policy.    (ii) The Conference had before them the following Papregarding -the Russian situation and the proposed neg-negotiations with Ma Erassins-A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs  (Paper G.P.-1350):A Note summarising the Conclusions of theInter-Departmental Russian Trade Committeeon the Chief Obstacles to the Resumption of.. Trade with Russia (Paper. CP,-1349):- A Note by the Board-of Trade  (Paper CP.-1342):A. Memorandum fr.om:the Political IntelligenceDepartment, Foreign Office, entitled &quot;Recent-   Tendencies in Soviet ,-Russia,T  (paper CP.-1326).The attention of the. Conference was particularlydrawn to the Note by. Lord Curzon (Paper CP.-1350),suggesting that the opportunity of M. Er.assinrs visitshould be seized&apos; in order to come to an understandingconcerning the many points on which the.British Govern-ment wore at issue with the Soviet Government in diff-different parts of Europe and the East&quot;.    These points were,- in particular,, the question of&apos;British prisoners andBritish subjects who.had been detained in Russia;    thequestion of Bolshevist interference in Afghanistan, in persia and the Caucasus;, and,  finally, the question-3- - &quot; &quot; .of/
 of General Wrangel&apos;s force in the Crimea.

It was suggested that any agreement in regard to trade would be impossible unless a general agreement on the political questions at issue with the Soviet Government were arrived at. It was most desirable that a comprehensive arrangement should be reached. The Conference was asked to remember that the present political situation gave His Majesty&apos;s Government an opportunity for driving a good bargain. In Poland, while there were indications that at the moment the Bolsheviks were enjoying some success against the Polish Armies and that the Poles would be unable to maintain hostilities later than July, the Polish Army was a strong military force. In the Crimea, General Wrangel had succeeded in re-organising his Army and instilling discipline into it. He had also conciliated the other political parties opposed to the Bolsheviks, and his force was one which new had to be reckoned with. It seemed very likely that he would be able to hold the Crimea against all attacks. In the Ukraine there was strong anti-Bolshevik feeling, and the peasantry were well-armed and capable of offering a strong resistance of the Bolsheviks. All these facts must be borne in mind in negotiating with M. Krassin. It was accordingly suggested that the British Government should offer to the Soviet Government their whole-hearted co-operation in concerting a Peace between the Soviet Government, on the one hand, and General Wrangel and the Polish Government on the other. The agreement in regard to General Wrangel should provide that the Crimea should form an asylum for the remnants of the classes opposed to the Bolsheviks, and that immunity from Bolshevist advances should be granted to the Crimea for at least a year. If such an arrangement was come to it was thought that the situation in Russia would be greatly improved and would permit of the Russian refugees now in the Crimea returning under amnesty to Russia. In return, the British Government should insist on a comprehensive agreement 

which/


which should cover the various points at issue.between the SovietGovernment and this country, namely,....tho return of prisoners fromRussia, and Bolshevist interference in Afghanistan&apos;;. Persia andthe Caucasus...     Tho agreement should also cover Bolshevist pro pa-&apos;ganda in the United Kingdom, Allied countries and Central Europe.If either tho Polish Government or General&apos;&quot;rangel&apos;.: refused&apos; toaccept the intervention of the British Government,&apos; the only course open to us would be to leave them to their fate.The suggestion was also made,, to. the Conference&quot; that itViould&apos; bo. desirable to obtain guarantees from the Soviet government as to the action of the Bolshevik Fleet in tho BalticThe Conference- accordingly agreed --(a ) That before opening negotiations in regard ,to trade with Russia,. the British GovernmentShould insist on the negotiation of a com--prehensivo political agreement with thoSoviet Government, on ,the lines suggestedin the Memorandum dated May 27, by the  :.&quot;Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Paper CP.-136.0):     :- :(b) That-the Admiralty and the .7ar Office should prepare, for circulation to the Cabinet,. astatement of the particular points on whichthey wished a...settlement to be reached with the Soviet - G: /eminent, such as, for - instance,the Naval situation in the Baltic. &apos;(iii) Re- (iii ) The Conference next considered the representation of present-ation of   Allied Governments at the meetings -dth M. - Eras sin.allied countries It was pointed out.that&apos;the Sum-erne - Council had ap-at meet-hags with proved.a telegram - to M,..Erassin on &quot;April 26,. 1920 (I.0.P.-109,LKrasslnAppendix I), which stated that the Supremo Council had decidedto authorise representatives of- the Allied Governments to meet m,- Eras sin and the Russian Trade Delegation with a view tothe immediate re-starting of trade relations between Russiaand other countries through-the intermediaryof tho
Co-operative organisations, and otherwise.     The telegramalso stated that the Allied representatives would be pre-pared to discuss with the Russian delegates the best methodof removing the obstacles and difficulties in the way of the resumption of peaceful trade relations, with a desire of finj&amp;-ing solutions in the general interests of   Europe,This telegram clearly mads it&apos;essential that theFrench and Italian Governments should, be represented at thenegotiations1 with M. Krsssin, and in any case the presenceof representatives of the allied Governments was desirable in order to preclude any appearance of separate negotiationon the part of His Majesty:s Government.     This was parti-   -cularly necessary in view of the fact that, in accordancewith the immediately preceding Minute, it was now proposednot merely to negotiate on the. subject of reopening trade relations with Russia but to attempt,to reach a comprehensivepolitical agreement with the Soviet Government, -The Conference accordingly agreed.That.the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should communicate at once withthe French Ambassador, and inform him ofthe policy wliich His Kajesty1 s Goverjjmentnow proposed to adopt in the negotiationswith M..Krassin.&apos;   A&apos;copy of the telegrameent to M. Erassin on the approval or theSupreme Council (1.0.F.-109, Appendix I)should be communicated to M. Caiaboji,&apos; andhe shoixld be. invited to attend the firstmeeting with M.. Krassin.     If- M. Cambonrefused to do so. without authority fromhis Government.,, the question could be con-sidered whether the Italian Charge d&apos;1 Affairesshoxild be approached. The Japanese Governmentshould also be given an opportunity of being    .   ...represented,..Conduct of (tv) The Conference were informed that, although one of thet5* Krassin&apos;sColleagues   conditions on. which M., Eras sin- and his party were admitted into this country was that they should not indulge in propaganda,. M.IQishko was- already making arrangements tosecure the admission into. Russia of certain British ex-tremists*     ,.&apos;as this action sufficient to warrant repre-sentationabeing made to M. Krassin, with, possibly an intimation/
activities did not cease?The Conference agreed  That so far the   action taken toy M. Klishkgdid not afford sufficient ground for making anywritten communication to M. Krassin, hut the PrimeMinister should use his discretion to raise itat his1 forthcoming interview. .POLICY (4)  On the assumptdou that it was desirable to resume&quot;RUSSIA . .&apos;-tsmH&amp;jpejAtions--^rith Russia, the Conference proceeded toExchangefor gold--, -consider the question whether it would not bo better tonegotiate on ths basis of payment by Russia &quot;in raw riaterialsrather than in gold.It was agrood that it was important that we should get into as close touch as possible with, the peasants andothers who were actually producing in Russia, and that-it&quot;would bo better from a political point of view to receivepayment in materials rather than gold.It was pointed out that the. answer to this questiondepended (1) on whether raw materials existed in Russia toany substantial extent, and (2) if they existed, whether theycould be got out5 and it was felt that if our aim was toencourage the actual Russian producer, better headway wouldbe made if we proceeded in the initial stages to exchangeBritish goods for gold in the hands of the Bolshevist Govem-rnent, and thereby stimulating the improvement of transport facilities.     It would be Impossible for rat&apos; materials to begot out of Russia until much greater transport facilities were available than was., the case at present...     By exchangingrailway material (locomotives and wagons) for gold., a startwould, be made which might result In the Russians being ableto export raw materials.      It was., however, generally agreedthat an operation which went no further than the exchange ofrailway material for gold would serve no useful purpose--.lGhts A discussion then took place as to the possible rights? BritishEditors,of British creditors of the former Russian Government to attach any gold which might be sent to this country in
I Export -Liepnodi-les frcmissia.payment    for goods to be now supplied to the BolshevistGovernment, and it was stated that the representatives of the farmer Russian Government contended that the bar gold now inthe possession of the Bolshevist Government was identifiable,and that accordingly, it would bs open to the successors of title of the old Government or the creditors thereof to attach the gold on its arrival here.It was generally agreed that the legal position inregard to this matter was obscure, and that while it mightbe open to the actual owner of identifiable gold to recoversuch gold, the same consideration did net at all ap-oly to. acreditor of that owner, who would., merely have a right tosue for a debt.      If, however, gold payments were made by. theCo-operative Societies,  acting on behalf of the Russian Govern-mont, those Societies could be regarded as being in theposition to give a title to the gold.In answer to an enquiry by the Prime Minister, Mr.Wise stated that the  commodities which Russia-had to exportwere flax, timber, grain and platinum.      It was improbable that any of the exportable commodities would form a part oftho previous purchases of the British Government.      It was estimated that there were about 20,000 tons of tlax available,but this Was thought an excessive figure by th,v Board of.Trade.      It should bo possible to rret a substantial quantityof grain out of. thfi Kuban and the Caucsysus, bartering it for.agricultural machinery, tools,  clothing, hup ts,  etc.., all of.which&apos; ware urgently needed by the peasants.    The negotiations,might proceed on the lines of. those adopted, last, year., whencommodities were exported from Great.. Britain to the Sea ofAzov and there bartered for grain,  eto. &quot;, M, Krassin was willing to allow the export, of. grain provided that, he could,first feed the inhabitants of the towns.- a -     &apos; .
Russian pre-Revolution debt.

The Conference thought it would be desirable, if possible, to get from M. Krassin some general undertaking on the subject of the Russian pre-Revolution debt. It might be possible to get the Bolshevist Government to recognise that debt, even if they were not prepared at this stage to discuss proposals for liquidating it. This would apply to sums borrowed by former Russian Governments from the Allies, etc., as well as debts owing to private individuals.

Supply of locomotives.

It was pointed out that, in any negotiations, care would have to be taken not to emphasize the benefits accruing to British trade. It might be said that, in promoting the exchange of railway material for raw materials and gold, the British Government were actuated by purely selfish interests. It was pointed out, however, that it would be quite open to the French or Italian Governments to say what commodities they could supply in exchange for Russian materials.

Some doubts were expressed as to the possibility of the Ministry of Munitions being in a position to supply locomotives at the present time, but it was understood that a substantial number of railway wagons was available for export to Russia.

Ultimately it was decided:-

That a Committee, consisting of -

Sir Laming Worthington Evans (Chairman)

Sir H. Llewellyn Smith,

Mr. Cecil Harmsworth,

Mr. C. E. Niemeyer,

Mr. E. F. Wise,

Mr. R. B. Howorth (Secretary),

should meet to consider the situation as a whole, and set out the points to be put to M. Krassin at his forthcoming meeting with the Prime Minister.
