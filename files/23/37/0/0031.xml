9 9 Qhf hi O(1)     With-reference, to Home Affairs Committee 50, Minute 7,the Conference had before them the following documents :-. A Memorandum by the Irirst - Lord of theAdmiralty,  (paper CP.-644)..A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (paper CP.-688)..A Memorandum- by the -Postmaster-General(Paper CP.-719 ).. A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP.-II63).. The position of established dockyard workmen had previously been before the Home Affairs Committee in rela-tion to two established men who had strack work, and, inconsequence of certain negotiations which were proceeding with the Trade Unions in respect of men who had refused to strike, the Home Affairs Committee had agreed to the action taken by the Admiralty in reinstating those men, withoutprejudice, and on the understanding that their cases were still sub judice.    It was explained that informal negotiateions were still proceeding with the Trade Unions, and itwas believed that the Trade Unions would agree to rescindthe expulsion of the men who had refused to strike, but would insist on imposing a penalty on them in order to upholdTrade Union.principles.In the Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper .0.2.-1162), it was. pointed out that the whole question had been re-opened by the participation of Iri3h PostalWorkers in the recent general strike in Ireland, and thatthe matter would shortly be brought to a head by the decisionof a forthcoming conference of the Union of Postal workers, .to be held in a ,few,daysr time, at which, the Executive    ,Council would propose the institution of a strike policy.It was therefore, suggested that Ministers must be prepared with a definite policy, and that the Home Affairs Committeeshould be asked to re-consider     the whole matter and make recommendations to the Cabinet.
2It was stated that the. Home&apos; affairs Committee had&apos;he en largely influenced in their decision to allow the caseof the Admiralty workers to stand&quot;over by the desire notto complicate the negotiations the admiralty had already undertaken for the reinstatement,in.:&apos;&apos;Trade Unions of estab-lished workmen who had refused to strike, and a decisionon the question of general principle was desirable,,Continuity.of .service .was an essential element inthe pension system, in return for; which Civil Servantsobtained security of tenure-fo   their working lives.    Ifthey were tobe allowed, to strike with impunity, the tax-payer would get nothing in return for the.heavy burden ofthe pension system.- .It was pointed out, on&quot; the other hand, that the . .position of established Civil Servants was. closely analogous to that of workmen qualifying for pensions in the railway services, who had frequently struck..   It had been impossibleto penalise these men.    In the same way, the Governmentwould be unable to prevent a Civil Service strike where alarge mass of men were involved, as in the Postal or Tele-graph Service, or where a widespread strike was threatened,on account of action taken in respect of one individual &amp;ual*The opinion was expressed that the only way to,dealwith the matter was by legislation   ...&quot;   &apos; forbidding a strikeby Civil Servants without adequate notice, as in the case of workmen employed in gas and water undertakings.The Conference were generally agreeo that CivilServants should not be permitted to go on strike withimpunity, but also recognised the practical difficultiesin enforcing any penalty in the case of strikes wherelarge numbers were.involved.The Conference agreed  (a) That ,tlie Home, Affairs Committee ,&apos; in oon-sultation with Ministers in charge of&quot;-Departments by which large numbers, of established workman were employes., be. requested, forthwith to consider thematter In all its bearings, and make recommendations to the Cabinet:&apos;   - 2 -
(b) . That th e H ome . Affair s C ommi 11 e e he re - -quested to consider whether a decision should he takr-ih on the- position of thetwo establishments shed. Admiralty workmen whohad taken part in the ironfounders*strike,  on the understanding that inno circumstances would the Government    -agree to a penalty being imposed by trade Unions on the established menwho had refused to strike.(2) The conference had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (paper CP. 1177)  covering adraft Bill to make provision for the temporary modificationof the charges- which may be made in respect of ports, harbour.dock and -pier Undertakings.    It was proposed, &quot;in view of theincreased wages payable to dockers in consequence of theaward given by Lord shaw&apos; s Committee, under the InoustrialCourts Act,  to empower the Ministry of Transport to raise&apos; the statutory ma:cLmum charges of these undertakings,  after taking the advice of the Rates Advisory Committee upon theproposed increase .   it was also proposed to. give the Ministryof Transport power to issue Interim Orders,  valid for notmore than six months,  to be made pending the receipt of thereport from the Rates Advisory&quot; Committee.The Conference agreed :-(a). To approve in principle the proposals contained in the.Bill.(b) That the details of the. Bill should.bereferred to a meeting of the Home AffairsCommittee to be held the same afternoon:(c) That,   subject to (b)  the Bill should beintroduced-by the. Minister of Transport.(3) With reference to Cabinet 5 (2o),  Conclusion 3,Cabinet 1.4 (20).  Conclusion 2,  and Finance Committee 18,Conclusion 1,  the Conference had under consideration the interim and Main Reports on Disability pensions submittedby the Disability pensions Committee (papers C .? , 847) and(CP. 1154) .It appeared that, with the exception of one or two points of detail,, the Committees recommendations were unanimous,- and the Conference deciced  :-;      3.

Thedraft Bill applied the principles of the Convention not onlyto cases of International flying, but also to internal flying in the British Islands,  and it repealed the existing Statutesgoverning air navigation, which -ill in future &amp;e regulatedentirely by the principles adopted in the Convention and applied by the Bill.On behalf of the Treasury a question was raised as tothe position of crown exemption under the Bill,  and the.Conference decided :-To approve the introduction of the. Bill inthe House of Lords,  subject to agreement being reached between the Treasury and the&apos;-. war office on the question of Crown exemp-tion.OP (5) With reference to a conference of Ministers held onANDiRT        February 2, 1920, Conclusion 3 (1),  the Conference had underBEE.     .consideration a note by the Acting secretary,  Cabinet,covering a letter from the Minister of Transport (paper c,p. 1167), in which the Minister requested that the questionof the continued-existence --of the Supply and transport committee should be again1 considered by the Cabinet.
