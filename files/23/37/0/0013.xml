Conclusion 5, theConference had before them a draft of Instructions to Mr.Macklnder (Paper CP.225), who is being appointed as british high. Commissioner and-Political Representative at the headquarters, of: General Deniicin.-
Stress was laid on the f^aort&quot;that-l^. -Jtfa^kinderT s .activities TTer^-^olJllyT^lit^eQ.1^ and that, although he       ITO3 to keep in the closest possible touch with the milageand economic Missions, these would operate independently?It was suggested that Mr. Mackinder&apos; is task would he Ia particularly difficult and. uncongenial one in view oftho fact that,  after a few months, no further supplierwould he cent to General T-enikin from this country,  anilMr. Machinder would therefore have nothing substantial&apos;wherewith to support his advice.After some discussion, the Conference expressed cor-currence in the Draft Instructions.      In view of the im-portance of further information to assist the Government in.f*39mle,ting their Russian policy, the Conference invited:-The Secretary&apos;6f State for Foreign affairs to add a paragraph to the Instructionsdirecting Mr. Mackinder to send a full report on the situation in South Russia.IIt     s also agreed :.-On page 4, line 20, to omit the word&quot;British&quot; from the phrase &quot;for theestablishment of British trade andIndustry&quot;.(The Se6retary of State for Far asked thatit might be placed on record that, in hisopinion, the&apos; Value of the Mission was seriously impaired by the omission of any iprovision for placing the British political representative in the Caucasus under mr. Mackinder.    This, he pointed out, hadbeen an essential object of the Mission,and it was doubtful if it would now serveany useful purpose.)DESPATCH OF (4)    Tith reference to Tar Cabinet 633, Minute o, theFOOD to murmansk, . Secretary of State for Tar informed the Conference thatGeneral Denilcin would be prepared to send 6,000 tons of flour to Egypt for feeding the troops in the Mediterranean 1area.      It. was proposed that an equivalent amount of flour should be despatched by the British Government to murmansk.    Such an arrangement would economise tonnage.The Conference agreed to the proposal of Ithe Seoret ary of St at e for Far,\j. -.&apos;.--.&apos;..---&apos;.&apos;-.&apos; I- 3 -
(5) With, reference to Conclusion 7 of a Conference ofMinisters held on November 18th, 1919, the Conference had before them two Memoranda   by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs  (Papers CP.-117 and C P.-228) regardingthe proposed provisional guarantee of the independence andintegrity of Belgium.It was explained that the Belgian Government desiredto abolish the old  iyit-em which had been established by theTreaty of i839 and to complete a new Treaty with the Dutchregarding Limburg, but, pending the establishment of theLeague of Nations, they were anxious to obtain from France andGreat. Britain a guarantee of Belgian Integrity and independ-ehce.    Holland showed the greatest reluctance to complete the negotiations with Belgium, and it was considered thata guarantee of Belgian integrity and independence by Franceand Great Britain would facilitate the conclusion of theTreaty between Holland and Belgium.It was pointed out that the Belgian Government had clearly changed their attitude.   During the earlier stages of the &apos;-&apos;ar they had always maintained that, If the 1839Treaty could be.abolished, Belgium would be able to make better arrangements for her own protection.    Their presentclaim was that Belgium should be relieved of her responsibility-ities under the 1839 Treaty to maintain her own neutrality,while at the same time her integrity and independence shouldcontinue to be guaranteed by France and Great Britain.    Shedesired to be a Sovereign State protected by France andGreat Britain without giving anything in return.     The limit of time In such a guarantee meant little&apos;, as, when the periodOf three or five years expired, it would probably be found impossible for France or Great Britain to withdraw the .guarantee;On the other hand, stress was laid On the fact thatthe integrity of Belgium had been a secular interest to
this country; that we should have to intervene if suchintegrity were menaced, even if we had not guaranteed it;and&apos; that popular   $pinion, as in 1914, would he solid insupport of a Government which -intervened in Jfurope in orderto fulfil its written pledges.&apos;    The existence of the TreatyOf 1839 might he said to have saved Europe, for the considera-tion that she had to fulfil her obligations under theTreaty had teen an important If not a decisive factor inInducing Belgium to defend herself against Germany.A suggestion was made that,&apos; In return for guaranteeingthe neutrality of Belgium, pending the establishment of theLeague of Nations, the British Government should demand from the Belgian Government a guarantee of 3elgian neutrality.The Obnferenoe Invited :-.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in the light of the above discussion, toconsider the possibility of making arrange-,ments with the Belgian Government wherebyBelgian Integrity and independence wouldbe guaranteed for a limited period by france and Great Britain, provided that belgium undertook to maintain her neutrality.2, Whitehall Gardens,- 6.W./12nd Pec ember,, 1919.
