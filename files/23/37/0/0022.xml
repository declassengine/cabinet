face, and as to the method by -which it^should be met,the Conference reached the following conclusions i-,(l)    That the situation was not sufficiently graveto warrant the Government adopting ascheme such as that proposed In the appendix to the Memorandum by the Minister of Transport(CP. 49o),  especially having regard to thefact that some eight or ten Battalions more were available than when the Home Officesuggestion was put forward.(2)   That a Committee should be appointed togo into the question of the safe keepingof weapons and in particular (l) toascertain the distribution of lethal weaponsthroughout the country, (2) to make recommendations as ta the measures forguarding them, and (3) to make recommenda-tions as to the best method for making them available to loyalists in the event ofany emergency.    The Committee to be coin-posed of the following :-Sir JTevil Macready (Chairman) and representatives ofAdmi ralty,Air Ministry,Ministry of Munitions, and war Office.(3)   That the Home Secretary should consider thesuggestion that a system of licensing shouldbe introduced to enable the loyal citizensto carry fire-arms and should report hisopinion to the Cabinet.(4)    That the Secretary for Scotland should beauthorised to summon a Meeting of the chief constables of Scotland to discuss with them the means that should be taken beforehandfor meeting industrial or revolutionarydisturbances by way of the preparation oflists and the formation of a skeletonand secret organisation by chief Constables.(5)    The Committee took note of the statement made by the Home Secretary that so far as england and Wales were concerned,   theHome Office had already explained to theChief Constables the urgency for the recruiting of an emergency force and thenature of the steps to be taken.
(JSOF^TED00ISATICmiK MEETINGSTRIKES.JIRE OF THEELY ANDKPORTpITTEE.2.    The Conference had under consideration thefollowing   papers :-Memo: by the &quot;Chairman of the Supply and Transport.   Committee   (CP, 501)Memo: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer v(CP.  006) .Memo: by the Minister of Munitions,    (CP.517)regarding a suggested permanent organisation for meetingstrikes.The Conference came to the following conclusions  :-(l)    To approve the schemes outlined inAppendices A* and B. of the Memorandumdated 26th january&apos;, by the Minister ofTransport.  (CP.  501)(?)To approve the expenditure involved inthe emergency schemes viz:-initialAnnualSurplus Stores(value of storesretained from.disposal) 25,388 105,240 461,296.(3)    That the expenditure in question shouldbe charged on the Home Office Vote.3.    The Conference had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (CP.503) asking that theSupply and Transport committee and its Sub-Committeeshould&apos;be dissolved,  that consideration of outstanding questions should be left to the Ministers concerned,and that responsibility for giving effect to cabinet decisions already taken should be placed on theDepartments concerned.The Minister of Transport stated that owing to pressure of work it had been very difficult to summonMeetings of the Committee;  that in his opinion theMinistry of Transport was less generally concerned *
with the propos ed emergency organisation than some- etherDepartments, and that his connection with the committee as Chairman seriously prejudiced his departmental work as Minister of Transport.    Ke also urged that ministers should share the responsibility for the emergency organisation, and that at the present he felt the tendencywas to leave to him, as Chairman, too great&apos; a share of theresponsibility..Some discussion then ansued during which it waspointed out that the experience of the Minister of Transport,as Chairman of the Strike Committee and of its successor theSupply and Transport Committee, was invaluable;&apos; that the strugglewould begin probably with transport questions and that itwould very largely centre round the problem of maintaining the transport services of the country.    It was considered essential that the Committee should not dissolve and that theChairman should, noreo-er, have the personal support of other ministers concerned.    It was impossible to say whether theindustrial trouble would come to a head, hut the Governmentshould be prepared in any case and Ministers should give their personal attention to the details of the organisation for meeting it.   A great impression had been.made on the public the last time by the perfection of the Governments organisation,and it would be very serious if in the next strike theGovernment did not live up to that high standard.
The Conference accordingly agreed -(1)    That the Supply and transport committee and its Sub-Committeeshould not be dissolx^ed but shouldcontinue in existence for anothertwo months, at the end of whichthe question would be reconsidered.(2) That the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Secretary of State for War and theSecretary for Scotland should bO addedto the Committee.(3) That the members of the Committee should use every endeavour to be presentpersonally at the Meetings, and to give their personal attention to theworking, out of departmental schemes,.   and that they should share with theChairman responsibility for theGovernments arrangements for meeting industrial disturbances.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.2nd February 192;,
