RUSSIAN POLICY

(1) With reference to the Conference on November 11th. the discussion on the question of British policy in Russia was continued.

A telegram was read from the British Mission at Vladivostok (No.6089), dated November 7th. 1919, containing the views held by General Gaida, the late Chief of Staff to Admiral Koltchak, on the situation.

It was reported that the only fresh news in connection with Russia was that General Denikin&apos;s negotations with the Ruthonians had reached a satisfactory conclusion, which meant the securing of General Denikin&apos;s left flank; and further, that the navigation of the Volga was closed by ice, which if true, would secure the position in the Caspian.

In view of the fact that the Poles were antagonistic to th Ruthenians, it was felt that enquiry should be made as to what would be the effect on General Denikin&apos;s relations with Poland of his agreement with the Ruthenians.

During the discussion which ensured the C.I.G.S. expressed the opinions that the Finns could, if they wished, take Petrograd, but they were apparontly only willing to make the attempt on conditions with which he understood we could not comply. He did not think it would be possible to expel the German forces from the Baltic without using force, and there was no force to use. In his opinion the Germans had no intention of leaving the Baltic provinces. He was a little anxious about the seven British battalions
which were being sent into East Prussia/   He agreed with whathid been said by the S/S for War as regards the Bolshevist forcesbeing concentrated against General Denikin if the Baltic States and poland stopped fighting.      It seemed probable that Admiral Kolt-ohak would lose Omsk:&quot;  and in-&apos;&quot;tiosc circumstances the Bolsheviks-would be able to withdraw forces&apos;not only from North but alsoEast Russia, and concentrate them against General Denikin, whowould probably be driven back.      This would inevitably have reflexactions upon the British positions in Persia and Afghanistan.It. would no doubt however take some time for the Bolsheviks to con-concentrate&apos; their forces against General Denikin.     personally he. was afraid, of the Germans and Bolsheviks coming to terms.    It was verydifficult to say what was the strength of the German forces in theBaltic; they might be anything from 20,000 to 40-000 men.The trend of the discussion at the Conference may besummarised as follows:-1(a) Finland.Although the Chief of the.. Imperial GeneralStaff expressed the opinion that the Pinna,from a military point&apos;of view.,- could,  if they wished, occupy Petrograd,&apos;it was agreed that itwould be useless to put pressure on the finnish government to undertake the operation, since they had made it clear,that they would net doso without support from the Allies on a scale which the Allies were not in a&apos; position to give.(b) Bill tic Provinces.(i) That as regards influencing the Baltic Statesall that could be done was &quot;to encourage them toact together, and that as already decided in thedespatch to the Baltic States approved by the WarCabinet (War Cabinet 624(1) and&apos;Appendix III) -they must be their own arbiters as to whethernegotiations with the Bolsheviks were entered intoor not.(ii) That the situation was very difficult in sofar as General Denikin&apos;rs aspirations were not thesame - as those of the smaller States, and that itwas doubtful if we ought to encourage the &quot;Bs-i ticStates to &apos; continue operations against the Uc&quot;1 sheviksin/
in order to relieve the pressure on general denikin; in view of the fact that the latter was not prepared to recognise the independenceclaimed by the States.( c) Siberia.It was recognised that President Wilson hadbeen very reluctant to interfere in Siheria, andthat the interests of the United States were mainly centred on keeping the Japanese in check andit was,generally agreed that the British policy had already been decided, namely, to endeavour toget the Americans and Japanese to be responsiblefor supporting the anti-Bolshevist forces in this theatre!(d)    South Russia.It was pointed out thst South Russia couldnot be completely pacified by military meansalone, and that its economic development was o v;vital importance, and with this object in viewMr. Mackinder had been appointed as British HighCommissioner to General denikin.   As regardssupport to General Denikin, it was agreed thatthe policy had already been decided.(e) Persia and Central Asia.It wss generally agreed that the Bolshevistactivity in Persia and Central Asia was one ofthe most troublesome problems which the BritishEmpire had to face.it) General.It was agreed that the German forces in theBaltio were In some ways oni? greatest source of trouble, and that, although, it was not possibleto prevent a certain amount of German penetrat-ion into Russia, if any re-modelling of a unitedRussic were to take place in the future it was most essential that it should not be done by theGermans; and again it was pointed out that to turn the Germans out of the Baltic provinces atthe present stage would to a certain extent assistthe Bolshevists.
With, a view to further discussion on, tho subject, theConference agreed that the following action should be taken:-fi)    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and-one Secretary of State for War should each.bea;sii&apos;ed to prepare a neper showing their conception-of tho a-ms of the feeir.an force in tho baltic provinces, and giving, if possible, the size ofthe force, its apparent motives, and any available information about the attitude of the GermanGovernment towards the force and the powers ofthat Government to oontrol it,(ii) The Secretary of State for War 3hould be askedto submit a memorandum for the consideration ofthe Cabinet, giving his proposals and explainingin what way, if any, he suggests that the Russianpolicy already approved by the Cabinet should be modified.fill) The Socretary of State for War should be askedto obtain particulars of the Agreement between general Dauikin and&apos;&quot;the Kuthenians and got :any information, available as to the likely effectof this Agreement on General Denikinrs relations.with Poland.IV ) The Eastern Committee, which should be attended by the Secretary of State for War.,  should be askedto consider the general situation in Central Asia,both from a political and military point of view and report to the Cabinet..2,       with reference to the Prime minister  Conference onOctober 31st, the Conference had before then a memorandum prepared in the Admiralty on the question of maintaining a naval Force in the Baltic during ths Winter 1919-20.Tho En-fst Sea Lord explained that if a small force woroto be loft in tho Baltic, there was. a possibility, in fact astrong probability, of calls being made on this force by thevarious Baltic. States for assistance:    and that the refusal of such request3 would without doubt lesson British prestigewhereas acquiescence would inevitably lead to operations onan increasing scale, possibly culminating in the necessityof. providing a forco similar to that now there,    Further, .the expense of keeping even a small force tin the Baltic wouldbo considerable and it would bo necessary to keep a similarnunber of ships in Homo waters In Order to arrange for itsrelief,, as the conditions of service in the Baltic- duringthe winter months would be severe and unpopular with the men.The. Admiralty could,- however&apos;, provide&apos; a- small forco, if desired.   .4$. During
. During tie diocus.0ion. which ensued, it wag &quot;pointed-out.that with a German fordo in the Baltic Stated&quot; and theproposed despatch at ah early date of seven British battalionsto East Prussia, it was not a very opportune moment at which to order a complete withdrawal of all British ships from thoBaltio and- the Conference decided:-That a small:force of ships, consisting of twoLight Cruisers and five. Destroyers should bemaintained: during, the winter non 3?.a in the Baltic,and that thi3 forco should not bo increased- without reference:to the Cabinet.21 Whit ehall Gar dens, S , -,7,1,12th November, 1919.
