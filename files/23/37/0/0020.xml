(1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised as a question of urgency the grant of credits for the relief of Austria and Poland and he stated that the United States were disposed to limit their assistance to the purchase of American Wheat for which it was proposed the British Government should provide tonnage at blue book rates. In addition the British Government were to provide a credit for the purchase of goods in any part of the world although the United States credit was to be devoted to the purchase of United States produce only. Such an arrangement would be grossly one-sided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had asked the Foreign Office to inform the United States Government that H.M. Government would be ready to give a credit not exceeding one half of the United States credit and not exceeding Â£10,000,000 in any case; the grant of this credit to be subject to the same conditions mutatis mutandis as in the case of the United States credit, and that each country should find tonnage for the goods which it supplied.

The Conference decided to approve the action taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.


(2)   The Conference had under consideration the following documents: *A memorandum, by, the President of the. Board* ; Trade on h-proposed Ministry of Mines(Paper C, P&apos;, -307):A memorandum by the. Secretary of State, forForeign Affairs on Expert Prices,of BritishC&apos;6al to France and Italy (Paper C,P,-414):A memorandum, by the President of. the Board. of Trade on Export Prices of - British coal to France&apos;and Italy (Paper&apos;C,P.-406):A memorandum by M,*Nit&apos;ti., on Ceal for Italy,handed to the Prime Minister ali Claridge&apos;sHotel, Paris, on January IS, 1020 (paper cp.-502)&apos;.A memorandum by the President pi the Boardof Trade on Goal Policy* together with &amp;JJraft Sill (Paper 0.

Goal Mines Department on thePirianW^ef ;the (3oal Industry, Miners*Wages, pixports;, and Supplies    (Paper&amp;*&quot; 514)*Tine Prime Minister stated, that he was receiving aiDeputation on the following day from the Miners&apos; Federation ofGroat Britain, and road a note of the ooints which would beraised by the Federation at that, meeting (Appendix)..The President of the Board of Trade, at the request ofthe Prime Minister, made a statement on the general position ofthe coal mining&apos;Industry, the gist of which is as follows.It appeared to be essential that the control of the-Indust^ should be rctaihed*  . The abolition of control wouldresult In a rise of the home price to .w.ox*3id-prices, and coalmight possibly/roach a price ef  -10 per ton in London.     Controlinvolved the ievsliing of profits over the whole Industry, sothat there should be equality between those firms which suppliedthe export trade and those ishich supplied the home trade.   . Thefermer were making huge profits and the latter were working ata loss, in some cases * .   A scheme was, therefore, required forlevelling up profits^     The present financial year should resultIn a balance without Idss er gain.     The political position wasthat a Bill, based&apos; on; the recommendations of the Sankey
Commission, had boon brought in by the GWornment, butthat Bill had not pleased either the miners or the coal-owners, and the Government, therefore considered themselvesre leased from, their undertaking to carry out the recommenda-tlons^of the Commissions     The President of the Board ofTrade now proposed a Bill ba30d on the following principlesfr(I)   Tho control of finance to continue to tho,,endof August 1920j W:-&apos;:&apos;(ii)   During that period the Government to guarantee to.-,   -the Industry nine-tenths of its pre-war standard..-profiti .   - .&apos;  (lii)   If the earnings of the .Industry permit, the pre -war standard profit to be made up. and one-tenth of the. net. aggregate . earnings lefi over to be shared out among the coal-owners in proportion to output,   ; This would be an incentive to development, .At the.request of the Prime Minister, the present and estimated, financial position of the coal industry was explain-ed by the Coal Controller, who stated that.the gross profits of the&apos; present financial year were estimated at  26,,000,0.00,This sum would however be, absorbed by the allowances to theowners for.s^andard^pr^fits and by capital allowances which also amounted..to  26,0C;Q-,000.     Industrial coal was now being sold at 8d, a ton less than tho cost of production,-and domestic ccai.at.10s,8d, a,ton less than the cost of produc-tion without allowing anything for owners profits *     The loss on these, two. transactions^ amounted approximately to. 25,000,000during the,present;financial year-    . As to the future, the calculations of. the Coal.Minos Department, had not been carried,further than August 31,, 1920, as.their powers under Defenceof the.

It was esti-mated--that, the profit on the industry between April 1, 1920;.and August..31.,. ,.19,20,. would be approximately  23,000,000,      Outof this-prof It, the, coal-oymers would have to be remunerated,so:that.tho surplus for the five, months would amount to somethinbetween  11,000,000 and  12.000,0000     The question was, what should be done with this surplus?   , , - ... .: The President of tho Board of Trade stated that ho was disposed to think
Commission, hact boon brought in by the aVrwhrnent, butthat Bill had not pleased either the miners or the coal-owners, and the Government therefore considered themselvesreleased from...their undertaking to carry out the recommenda-tions^of the Commission.     The President of the Board ofTrade now proposed a Bill based on the following principles??&apos;(I)   The control of finance to continue to tho,-e^d. of August 1920 j \(ii)   During that period the Government to guarantee to.-,the industry nine-tenths of its pre-war standard.profit;     . .   , .-  (Hi)    If the. earnings of . the industry permit, the pre-war standard profit to be made up. and one-tenth of the net. aggregate . earnings left- over to be shared out among the coal-owners hjhi proportion to output,  ; This would be an incentive to development, .At the,request of the Prime Minister, the present and estimated financial position of the coal industry was explain-ed by the Coal Controller, who stated that the gross profits of the- present financial year were estimated at  26,000,000.This sum would however be,.absorbed by the allowances to theowners for. standard;,profits and by capital allowances which also amounted to  26,0^9,000.     Industrial coal was now being sold at 3d. a ton less than the cost of production, and domestic cg.a.1..at 10s ,8d. a. ton less than the cost of produc-tion without allowing anything for owners profits *     The loss on these two transactions amounted approximately to  25,000,000during the.present-financial year.     As to the, future, the calculations of. the Coal-Mines Department, had not been carried further, than August 31,., 1920, as.their powers under Defenceof the Realm Regulation..9.G. ended on that date..     It was esti-mated--that-1; the profit on the industry between April 1, 1920,and August. 31,. ,1920, would be approximately  23,000,000.      Outof this, profit the. coal-owners would have to be remunerated,so that the surplus for the five months would amount to somethinbetween  11,000,000 and  12.,00.0.,000,     The question was, what should be done with this surplus? .: The President of the Board of Trade stated that he was disposed to think
that the miners had a ease f or jan ino-r*asa, at an early* , *&apos; &quot;        ;&quot; &apos;    .&apos;,date, in wages of l/- a shift.    This would amount to 11/-Increase in every two weeks, and would oo.at-u.s.^OOOrOOO forthe whole year.    If this increase in wages were granted, only 4,000,000 of the estimated profit during the period April 1to August 31 would remain.    As against this, however, thecoal-owners urged the Government very strongly not to cutaway profits &quot;by giving rises in wages.   The proposed Billpromised that one-tenth of the net aggregate earnings leftover from the guarantee, to the industry should &quot;be shared outsa&amp;ang the coal-owners, a&amp;d the owners ^maintained that theGovernment should not, by increase of wages, destroy this surplus of one-tenth.    This one-tenth was considered to bean incentive to development.   Unless further development tookplace the coal pnblem would become Oven more acute in fivayeersf time than it was now.    It was considered that the one-tenth would be a sufficient&quot; incentive to developm^t if theowners could at the same time be given a decision as to thefuture of the industry.The President of the Board of Trade, continuing,&apos;statedthat there were the following five possible courses before-the Government:-(a) Unrestricted competition.As regards this possible course, the result of de-control.&apos;would be that all mine-owners would enter the export traderand would neglect, the home trade;    home prices&apos;&apos;would probablyrise 15/- a ton on the first day of de-control, and would subsequently reach the world level;    export prices would,tend to drop;    the miners in&apos; all coalfields would at once&apos;demand an increase in wages and there would probably be ageneral  -strike, with the result that the whole- industry and export trade of the country would be upset and there wouldbe complete ohacs-. * .(b) The establishment of&apos; a Ministry of mines, w-ith D imited powers, &quot;to be associated, with a Council ,,of theindustry.B*- rwgard^d,  he-* adoption, hi ihJ,^- alternative-as the, most
hopeful course.    It was true that It would be a temporary measure, but he considered that the Government could not, at?resentmoment, make a definite announcement in regard to thefuture of the coal industry, the circumstances of which werechanging from week to week.   A Ministry of Mines would, hethought, provide neutral ground on vrfhich coal-owners and coal-miners oould meet, and it would at the same time continue thepresent oontrols over Export and home prices, which were essen-tial, and would see that profits were equalised.    The miners atthe present moment did not appreciate how far tho coal-owners were prepared to go in the direction of sharing profits.   Theemployers wished to have a common meeting-ground with the men.The three remaining alternatives were:-(c) Enforced district amalgamation, con-trolled by a Government Department,on the lines of Sir Arthur Duckham&apos;3proposals in his Minority Report asa member of the Sankey Commission; ;(d) The creation of district publio trusts    *to work the mines, on the model of thePort of London Authority:(e) Thoroughgoing nationalisation, witha Government Department as the iltimate authority.The last throe alternatives were modifications of nationali-sation.Considerable discussion ensued in regard to proposal(b) above.    It was urged that tho proposal really left mattersmuch as they wero, and aid not settle the question of natlonali-sation, on whioh the country was oxpecting a pronouncement.It wouia be very difficult to introduce tho proposed bill into the House of Commons with a statement merely that theGovernment had decided to appoint a Committee to prepare aschema for the rest of the reconstruction period and that aMinistry of Mines would be act up.    The Government wouldimmadiataly be asked to state what their general policy wasin regard to the coal industry.     On the one hand, it wasnrgied that the assentlal objeot at whioh the Governmentahould aim was de-control of the industry.   The ooal-ownors
-awished to be free, and the Government themselvec would never be 1&apos;ree until they resigned their control over the industry.It was suggested that the coal-owners should he asked,  inreturn for de-control of the industry,  to guarantee that theywould keep the prices of coal for internal consumption in theUnited Kingdom below fixed maxima.    The trade,  in fact,  shouldeentrol itself.    On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthe coal-owners had already stated their inability to controlall the members of their Association.   During the earlierperiod of the War many Coal-Owners had not kept the agreement made with the Coal Owners Association,  and had resisted theagreement whea   the Bill to confirm it was before the Houseof Commons.    It was hardly likely that they would regard amoral obligation as mere binding in times of peace.   It wouldbe impossible to control the industry effectively except bymeans of compulsion.   The more moderate coal-owners wanted aDep&amp;rta&amp;sttt*     The Department might be a separate Ministry ornot, acting with an Advisory Council, subject to(i) Restriction of exports by the Department;the(ii) Restriction ef home price by/Department;and(iii) equalisation ef profits amongnt coal-owners.The last was essential, as miners in districts where low wages were&quot;prevalent before the War would not consent to revert tothose wages.It was pointed out that the scheme proposed by thepresident of the Board ef Trade might result in driving theowners into nationalisation.   The owners might very well ln-sist upon beibg bpught out of the industry, in order that theymight invest their capital more remuneratively elsewhere.There was a real danger that the owners and the miners wouldcombine in the demand for nationalisation.   It was urged that proposal (&quot;b) above, as an alternative to nationalisation,should h* made mare explicit.   There was obviously a via mediabetween complete de-control and complete nationalistic^ and before any announcement could be made to the Uiners1 Federation- 6 -
the next day, or to tho House of Commons the next Session,fuller details would have to be provided.It was generally agreed that it would ba useful to havea draft, by the President of the Board of Trade, of theannouncement which, In his opinion, the Prime Minister shouldmake in the House of Commons,,   This draft should meet thequestion, which would undoubtedly be raised, of the generalcoal policy which the Government would adopt.     It should alsotabulate the dangers which would result from. compXe4iav--6je-^^^ni^^o-l,of the industry, on the one hand, and the objections to com-plete nationalisation, on the other.     If possible, it shouldmake definite proposals in regard to the Governments policy,The present disuussion would be regarded merely as a preliminar-ary discussion to clear the ground, and ultimately the PrimeMinister would have to ask the Cabinet for a decision on two alternatives, viz s-(1)&apos;Whether he should make a declaration ofpolicy to the Miners * Federation oil thefollowing day,or(11) Whether he should say that he was merelywilling to listen to the miners, and thatany statement of policy to be made by theGovernment would naturaxly be made in theHouse of Commons and could not be made toa deputation outside Parliament.The Conference accordingly decided j-That the President of the Board of Tradeand the Coal Controller should, in thelight of the above discussion, draft a- statement elaborating the proposal forthe establishment of a Ministry of Mines,with Mmited powers and in association with. a Council of the industry, and that this1 statement should be considered at a further meeting of the Conference to be held onthe same -day at 5 p.m*
* &apos; JhffROL OP S* The Chancellor of the Exchequer saidless.-that he wished to draw attention to the general question of the control of prices of foodstuffs &apos;-and other commodities *     Tho position was that hiss-Department had ,been counting on a great reductionof the bread subsidy;   but they were now informed by the Pood Controller and the -Wheat commission that the subsidy so far from being reduced nighteven have to be increased to 65 millions sterlingsFurther, it was understood that the profit onbutter would make good the loss on cheese, butit now appeared that we were to lose on butteralso.     He did not wish to raise the *.ole questionfit that meeting, but he desired to inform hiscolleagues that the matter was urgent, and tha*t hehad asked the Food&apos; Controller to bring the question before the Cabinet&apos; at a very early date*Reference was made to the present controlof beer, under which the Irish brewer was permitted to brew beers of a higher gravity than was allowed in the case of the English brewer, whowas consequently severely handicapped and beingdeprived of his market.     Comment was also made onthe unprecedented profits which were at present being reaped upon practically every uncontrolledarticle of sale, and the Conference was reminded that the view had been held by many competentadvisors that the various controls should havebeen maintained for a much longer period.     On theother hand, it was pointed out that letting go the controls had meant an increase of employment,whereas their retention would have accentuated analready difficult problem..
4.     With reference to Cabinet 2 (SO), Conclusion 2,when it had been decided that the matter shoulxi^be--referred to an inter-departmental Committee, theConference had under further consideration the ,question of the future organisation of the        &apos; .Territorial ForcedThe Secretary of State for tfar said that thiswas a very important topic* which in former years would have engrossed the attention of the Cabinet,for some days, but circumstances rendered itnecessary that a decision should be reached that morning.     The last time he had brought thequestion before the cabinet he had himself beenundecided in mind as to what was the best policy.He had since discussed the subject with a great number of men^ who from their experience werecompetent to form and express an opinion ^ and hewas satisfied that it was not possible to enlistTerritorials for Home Defence only.     The merefact that we proposed to raise 14 Divisions was bound to as*ouse suspicion, &apos;   He had, therefore,oome to the conclusion that it would he bestfrankly and plainly to ask would-be recruits to *accept Imperial and Oversea obligations and tell them that if, for Instance,, Germany appeared again on the Rhine, or Russia was advancing on India, thjsywould have to proceed overseas.     At the same time it was desirable to re-assure those we hoped toencournge to come forward, by stating that theywould not have to cross the sea until an Act ofParliament had been passed stating that a nationalcrisis existed-    Accordingly, he suggested thefollowing steps, (a) recruits should he told thatthey were? wanted for Imperial defence in certaincontingencies;   (b) that they might be embodied when
an emergency arose;    (c) that they would not be sent out of the country until an Act had been passedclearly showing that a national emergency had arisen*At the same time - and all who had any knowledge and experience of Territorial sentiment attached the greatest importance to this - they should beinformed that they would only be sent overseas asunitsIt might further be statedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government only contemplated awar of self-defence, and they would therefore await ;iwith confidence any emergency.     To attempt toraise.a large force of 14 Divisions for any other purpose than to undertake Imperial obligations,would be regarded as humbug by the general public &apos;who would think that they were being invited tocome forward and enlist in large numbers for strike-breaking purposes, and so on;    while they would be convinced In their own minds that the government intended to send them abroad in any case when itsuited them.     He had only arrived at this conclu-sion after much anxious thought, but It representedhis deliberate and considered opinion; he&apos; therefore in s&quot;tinp*urged complete frankness that officers and men ofthe Territorial Force should be asked to accept a liability for General Service..,   He had recentlydiscussed the question at a meeting of representa-tives of the Territorial Organisations p. who were pratically unanimous in agreeing that this liabilityshould be imposed though their views perhaps werebysomewhat vitiated/the fact that their wish wasfather to the thought...
&apos; v    Some discussion followed in the course ofwhich it was stated.that the present British ambassador in Paris who, both before and during the war, had been closely associated with recruiting for the territorial force and for the Kitchener Army; was very doubtfulas to the advisability of adopting- the policy suggestedby the Secretary of State for War-     Oh the oiherhand, there was general agreement among the ministers present as to the desirability of taking the linourecommended by Mr. Churchill.The Secretary of State for War said that hehad re-cast to some extent the scheme (CP,571) whichhe had recently submitted to the Cabinet, but he waskeeping it well within the former financial limit.He decided to have one Class only In the territorial force, but he was keeping alive 74 Battalions ofthe old Special Reserve, which he proposed to re-christenthe Militia *     This Militia was liable to be oalled outin aid of the Civil Power, whenever necessary.     his idea was that oifer Army of the future should consist oftww lines.- (a) the Regular Army and tbe Militia, and(b) the Serrisotlal force was also assemblingshortly a Conference tc decide the future organisationof the Yeomanry,.     In repay to a question by thePrime Minister, Mr. Churchill said, that volunteers for the Air Force were at present being recruited bythe Air Ministry and he thought that this procedure was best at the present stage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated thathe understood that the scheme, as re-oast by Mr.Churchill, would work within the present estimates.He wished to point out, however, that for the nextyear or two the&apos; estimates of the Service departments would be a matter of great difficulty and he doubted whether the Departments would be able to keep within their limits.     He suggested, therefore,.thai the War
Office should, for the next two or three years, &quot;reduce the expensed of the Territorial, force below normal, if possible, by limiting the number &amp;foamps, drillsj and so ftn,The Secretary of state for War stronglydeprecated lowering the efficiency of the hew Forcewe proposed to raise, in order to save what would bea comparatively small sum.The conference decidedTo approve in principle(a) That the pre-war Territorial force should be reconstituted and organisedas 14 Divisions, composed similarlyto the regular Divisions of the Army.(b) That officers and men of theTerritorial Force should acceptliability for General Service,with the undertaking by HisMajesty*s Government that no member of the Force should begj&amp;nt overseas until parliament had decided that a national emergency had arisen of so seriousa character as to Justify this step,(c) That it is the intention of theGovernment that the Territorial *Faroe, as re-organised should not. be used for draft-finding purposesat, the Regular Army, but that units. alone .should in the first instancebe sent averseas; e.g. battalions,brigades of artillery, or regimentsof cavalry.
OUR POLICY IN RUSSIA - EVACUATION FROM SOUTH RUSSIA OF NON-BOLSHEVIK ELEMENTS.

 

5. The Chief of the Imperial Staff asked permission to draw the attention of the Conference to the situation in South Russia. A telegram had recently been received asking for British assistance in evacuating not only the sick and wounded men of non-Bolshevik elements, but also women and children from South Russia. The "Panama" with 650 cases of sick on board, including many typhus cases, had arrived at agreed to take in 1,000 such cases at Constantinople. Our Commissioner at Constantinople had wired for nurses and doctors to attend to these cases, but it was quite impossible for the War Office to supply them. While the Conference was sitting, he had received a further telegram from our Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean saying that he had ordered every transport available to proceed to Sevastopol to evacuate 25,000 invalids and refugees from Sevastopol; these numbers were apart from the 30,000 cases that were awaiting evacuation at or near Odessa. The Field-Marshal said that he would like instructions as to what should be done. He himself thought that it was impossible for us to shoulder this burden alone, and that it should be shared by France and Italy.

Some discussion followed, in the course of which it was pointed out that, while no humans person could possibly be deaf to such an appeal, it was impossible for Great Britain to undertake a responsibility of this kind which she was quite unable to discharge. Reference was made to the suggestion which had been put forward that these cases might be landed on some of the islands in the Eastern Mediterranean where a certain number of huts existed for their accommodation; but there were at present no means of supplying the patients with food.

It was/


It was urged that as it was absurd for us to pretend that we could feed, doctor, nurse, house, and provide for all these thousands of wounded, invalids and children, the only practical alternative was that the non-Bolshevik elements in South Russia should capitulate to their opponents; that our policy in the future should be not to encourage small nations on the borders of Russia to fight the Bolsheviks, but to advise them to make peace with the Soviet Government, and that in any case we must do nothing which would stand in the way of their coming to terms with that Government. In support of this policy it was pointed out that the Bolsheviks had, after all, practically nothing to gain by over-running Poland, Germany, Hungary, Persia or Roumania,, or even the Caucasus, except that they might gain control of the oil fields in the latter region. These countries could offer nothing to the Bolshevik armies but famine and typhus, and history showed that hordes of barbarians only over-ran foreign territories for purposes loot. The argument was pressed, on the other hand, with great force that it was obviously the policy of the Soviet Government to make peace for the present with the Entente Powers, and in particular with Great Britain, as this would leave the directors of the Soviet regime complete freedom to persue their designs against the smaller nations on their borders. Russia was now dominated by the two very able, unscrupulous, and dangerous men, who had well disciplined armies and enormous resources at their disposal.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Patek, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs who was at present in London had been to see him the previous day in order to discuss the situation with him. M. Patek had pointed out that both Kolchak and Denikin had now been completely defeated, and were probably incaple of any 

further/


&apos; iTurther resistance9     In the circumstances were theEntente Powers prepared to support Poland with armed forces, munitions etc.     The Prime.Minister said that hehad felt strongly that he ought to be quite frank withMs Patok&apos;, and he had accordingly told him that it wasImpossible for ourselves and our Allies, to give him sup-port of the nature Indicated by him.     He further informedMo Patek that if Poland, embarked o,n a war. with theSoviet Government wo must wash our hands of all renoon-slbiliiy.The general trend of the discussion was in the-sense that, in the circumstances, no good would be. gained by the proposed action of the Commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean to send out all available shipping,which was urgently needed elsewhere, to Odessa,It was agreed that the Conference,-before reaching any decision should await and consider the report of sir H.J,Mackinder,- who had arrived in England, and he hoped to submit his report to the Prime minister in the course of the next day or so02, Whitehall Gardens, S/7.127th January, 1920.
