.IViThe two  forces of the Irish Police, viz., the.I.O. and the D.M.P., have reached a state where itis absolutely necessary that a thoroughly competentofficial should be appointed to supervise the entireorganisation, and to recommend to the Irish Governmentsuch changes as are essential.      It has bee,] suggestedthat Lieutenant-General Sir Edward. Bulfin, KACiBi,  OiV;0.,who is an Irishman, would be well Qualified for this duty.      He would require but a small staff,  but itis essential th&amp;t he should have a first-rate intelligenceofficer at his disposal to collate information and form by. degrees a secret service or detective branchfor the police forces in Ireland, which is now non-existent.     A selected inspector or chief inspectorfrom Scotland x&amp;rd would be invaluable to him. for somemonths, to advise on purely police matters.A secret scheme has been put forward to the D.M.I.,War Office,  to cope with the present state of siegein Lublin.10th May,  1S20.
