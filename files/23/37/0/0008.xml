Downing Street,, on the previous day, onthe subject of a proposed permanent organisation to deal -with national emergencies, the Chaneeller. of the Kg&amp;hequer,&apos;who had bsen unable to be present when this questi&amp;n.was discussed, explained that he had been informed that certainstores which were essential to the scheme were now beingseld to the general public.    The question was now being con-sidered by his Department in regard to its financial aspeotbut in the meantime he suggested that the Disposal board might be instructed temporarily te suspend action in respectof those articles which, might be essential to the scheme *The Conference concurred in the view taken by the Chancellor of the Exohe-quer, and instructed the Secretary  /&apos; ii)   To ask the Minister of Munitions to postpone for a month the disposal Ofsuoh stores as were i-nvolved in thwscheme of the Supply and transport committee.(ii)    To request the Ministry ef Transport   ;./to..-communicate a list cf the stores&quot;   concerned to the Ministry ef Munitionsfor the Information of the DisposalBoard.(S) Having regard to the great importance, both fromthe point of view of our future relations with India andfor political reasons generally, of pressing on thisquestion, it was agreed that Thursday and Friday state next week, November 27 and 20, 1919, should be devoted to theDiscussion of the Indian Reforms Bill in the House of Commons.It wasv felt that, in view *f the large amountof time occupied with the Indian Reforms/Bill in Committeeup3taira, and the harmonious arrangements, that had been,arrived at, it should be sufficient if two days only ofParliamentary time were reserved for it in the House of-Commons.PREMIUM. BONDS
^oXf te*&apos;l?ithreference,to Cabinet i (19), Minute 6, when itwas decided that if the House of Commons desired, the adcp-tion of a system of Premium Bonds, the Government, should netoppose it,.;, attention was drawn to the growing strength ofthe movement against Premium Bonds..- The Memorandum- ofthe Chance liar Of the Exchequer, covering a letter fro-m theGovernor of. the Bank --Of-England (Paper C.P.-95) and ether.....       indications were cited as evidence that opposition toPremium &quot;Bonds was growing; both inside and outside, the   ^r--Government,   It was&quot;consequently felt that, when receiving the Deputation of the National Pree Church Council en thesubjeatI the PrimeMinister should be aocompanied by ministers who&quot;were in favour;if,1 as well as these Who werespposed&apos;^ to V&apos;the1 issue of these &quot;Bonds,  &apos;   &apos;This&apos; led to a general discussion c%. the question of-Premium Bonds, in the course of which the following reasonswere urged against the proposal;-fa)   That it was a-highly, disputable quest ion- v,       whether they would raise any large amountof money:(D,)   That Sir Robert Klndersley, who had been .mainly responsible for the success of theNational War Bonds, strongly condemned the project:(o)   That it was repugnant to the moral sense of the. public, as indicated by pro testswhich had been received from representa-tiTirss of every religious body.It was recognised that the Government would beplaced in an embarrassing position if the Chancellor ofthe Exohequer, who would be bound to speak and would pro-bably have.to open the discussion on the subject, made a speech against Premium Bonds and the House subsequentlydeoided in favour of them, in which case the Chancellor.would, nevertheless have to introduce the necessary legisla-&apos; tion,.   It was generally agreed, however, that, in spite ofthis objection, if the scheme was .found on examination tobe detrimental to the national interests,  it would bedesirable for the Chancellor to give the House the reasonsagainst its adoption..
The Conference agreed    That the Secretary should notify Mr. Montaguand Sir 1. T/orthington-Evans that the PrimeMinister would be glad if they, as well as mr, Bonar lav/ and Mr. Chamberlain, ?/ouldaccompany him when he received the Deputa-tion from the Free Churches.(4) From the above discussions the Conference turned toconsider tho question of the Business of the House ofCommons,    A general desire was expressed that Parliament  .should not re-assemble immediately after Christmas.    Inaddition to the Indian Reforms Bill,  the question ofPremium Bonds, and the Electrical Supply Bill, thefollowing were mentioned as matters of great urgency:-IRISH BILL    (which was still before the Cabinetwithout any decision as to a Bill).THE LAbD SETTLEMENT (SCOTLAND) BILL (Report Stage),THE COaL (LIMITATION OF PROFITS) BILL,THE IMPORTS AND EXPORTS BILL (which was to be laiion the Table of theHouse, that afternoon).No decision was taken-, but the trend of opinion wasin favour of carrying over outstanding Bills until the next session.It was suggested that the precedent set by SirT7illiam Harcourt in 1393-4, should be looked into, witha view to ascertaining whether a new Session would haveto commence before March 31, 1920.As regards immediate Parliamentary Business, thefollowing arrangements were agreed toj-Thursday^ November 20:    The Electricity Bill, as arranged (see Minute 5belowKFriday, November 21:       The Housing Bill - as arranged.Monday and Tuesday,November 24 and 25:       The Electrical Supply Bill.Wednesday, November 26: either rremium Bonds or thoLand Settlement (Scotland)Bill (Report Stage), to be-   .. ananged between the PrimeMinister,- . tho Leader of theHouse of Commons and LordEdmund Talbo&apos;0 ).Thursday and Friday,November 27 and 28: Tho Indian Reforms Bill.
$AECTHXOITYUPPLY BILL.(5)   With reference to War Cabinet-minute^-^the- -Minister of Transport- raised a point of urgency inconnection with the Electricity Supply Bill.   Ho statedthat tho Bill had received somewhat drastic handling in committee upstairs in the House of Commons:    in particular,Clause 44 had boon cut out of the original draft, whichproposed to transfer tho general control of electrical power from the Board of Trade to the Ministry of Transport.The effect of this would be two fold;-fa)    It would render impracticable a schome,which had been devised after the most careful consideration, of unifying andco-oraLinating electrical power throughoutthe country on an identical gauge andunder a single control,with a view both to economy and also to tho rapid andwidesproad, development of many of ourindust ries , incluiling.-AgricuXture:- and(b)    It would place electrical power undor theBoard of Trade, which.had no. technical staff accustomed to direct practical ser-vices, and which was surcharged withwork of its own/If tho Committee^ views were accepted by the House,throe grave mistakes would, in his opinion, be mado:-(1)    Tho powers would be taken  com thh-Ministryof Transport:fii)   They would be placed under the Board ofTrade, which was undesirable for the abovereasons:(iii)    Electrical supply would bo divided up into&apos; ;two parts, and be under two; directing agencies,involving the separation of the industrialfrom thetransport user^The President of the Board of Trade said that he agreed generally with the above view:    his Department was anxious to see railways included in tho general scheme oftrade development by more extensive use of electrical power.   His advisers were not, however, unanimous as tothe Department which should be responsible for thedireotdon of electrical supply, but failing the settingUp of a General Fuel Department, which was advocatedin certain quarters, he agreed that the control shouldbe under the Kirjisirry of Transport,
The Home Secretary, who was in charge of the Bill,explained that the opposition in Committee upstairs was dueto the fact that the Committee was largely composed ofrepresentatives of municipal^ power-house, and other inter-ests, who met on the common ground of jealously of andantagonism to Government intervention In electrical manage-ment.The Conference agreed t-(a) That the control of electrical supply anddistribution under one Department was essen-tial to the proper development of industryand transport in this country.-(b) That this control should be vested in theMinistry of Transport as the most appropriated departments(c) That if the House would not accept the ministerial view, it would be advisablenot to proceed with the Bill....(d) That the more reasonable critics of the bill might be reconciled to its adoption if theywere told that, unless the Government viewprevailed, the Bill would be dropped:(e):That the procedure followed in the case ofthe Aliens Restriction Bill, when Ministersmet the principal critics in the House, mightbe adopted with advantage in the present instance:(f) That it was desirable that the Prime Minister,if possible, accompanied by Mr, Bonar Law, Mr.Shortt and Sir Eric Geddes, should meet thesaid critics with a view to reinforcing the powerful arguments urged by the Ministry ofTransport.The Home Secretary and the Whips undertook to arrapge *.hat Mr. Neville&apos; Chamberlain and .Mr. A Neai with others if necessary, should meet the Prime Minister, the Lord privy seal, the Home Secretary and the Minister ofTransport, in the Leader of the House&apos;room that afternoon at 4 p.m.jand also to lay upon the Table of the House the following morning a new Clause re-embodying the pro-posals contained in Clause 44 of the original draft.
petroleum executive,57  [(6) The Conference had under consIderratJLon-^&quot;&quot;Memorandimby the President of the Board of Trade (Paper CP.-91) and jja Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP.115) regarding the future of the Petroleum Executive.The feeling of the Conference was in favour of theproposal made by the First Lord, and it was decided:-] ANGLO-FRENCH;j AGREEMENTf REGARDING[OIL SUPPLIES *I EXTORT OF OILI FROM SOUTHI RUSSIA.RETENTION OFRATIONALFACTORIES BYSHE GOVERN-.1ENT.(a) That the Petroleum Executive should be con-stituted on a permanent basis and be placed under the charge of the Under Secretary of Stateresponsible for the Department of Overseas Trade(Sir Hamar Greenwood);    the necessary arrangements;for the transfer being made between Sir hamar greenwood and Mr. Walter Long.(b) That the Petroleum Executive should exercise a general control over oil questions:(c) That all Departmental oil purchases shouldbe made In consultation with, the petroleum executive.(7)    With reference to War Cabinet 619, Minute 1, theConference also considered the proposals in the Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP.-115) relatingto the Anglo-French Agreement on oil supplies and the exportof oil from South Russia.The Conference.decided:-That these questions should be referred toSir Hamar Greenwood, as head of the petroleum executive, and that Sir Hamar Greenwoodshould place himself in communication withthe First Lord of the Admiralty in regardto them e(8)    The Conference had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Munitions (Paper CP.-106) in which authority was requested for the disposal of the following factories:-RAM. Factory, Irvine,Avonmouth,SwindohjR.G.P.F. Waltham Abbey (except Southern portion),*      Ellesmere Pert.Gloucester,National Machine Gun Factory; Burton-on-Trent,National Small Arms Ammunition Factory,Blackpole, Worcester.It was also proposed in the Memorandum that In thecase of the last two factories the terms of sale or-leaseshould include provisions for the retention of plant and
the re-conversion of the factories within a specified time to the manufacture of munitions in the event of anational emergencycSome discussion ensued as to the rate of disposalof munitions factories^ and it was suggested that   theGretna Green factory should now be used for the manufactureof , cordite for the Wavy as well as for the Army.   During thenotWar this had/been practicable, as the cordite used bythe Army was not suitable for Naval use, but it was consid-ered likely that new specifications for Naval corditecould be agreed between the Admiralty and the War Office,and that the manufacture of cordite for both Services couldbe carried out at one factory.The Conference decided(1) To approve the proposals set forth inthe Memorandum by the Minister ofMunitions (Paper CP.-106)(ii) To call attention to the decision given on May 1, 1919 (War Cabinet 561, Minute 2)to the effect:-&quot;That the provision of training facilitiesfor disabled soldiers should be regardedas having the first claim on national factories which were suitable for thepurpose, provided that, when a factorywas saleable, and another, for which no purchaser could be found, could be rendered reasonably suitable, theTraining Department.should accommodateitself to the latter&quot;...........-....*2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W.-1.November 19, 1919,
