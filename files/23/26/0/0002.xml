V       (1) With reference to Cabinet 46 (Si) 5 Conclusion i,&apos;th^^ablna^-^e*rjTne^ ^in regard to the agriculture Act.    In addition bo the Report of the CabinetCommittee (Paper 0oPo^995) they had before them a Memoran-dum by Mr Hugh Paul, a member of the Wheat Commission, whichhad been circulated by the First ComnrLsaloner of Works, theChairman of the Wheat Commies ion (Paper 0,P0-5001-).While the extreme difficulty of forecasting prices was fully recognised^ the Cabinet were impressed by the pos-sibility that the New York Price of Wheat might fall to 120cents per bushel (49/- per 504 lbs,), which would involvethe Government in an approximate liability of  12,400,C0C;while oats might fall to 50/- per statutory quarter of BISlbs,, involving a liability of  17,; 350, 000.    If prices fell to this extent the Government liability miplxt,  therefore,exceed  30,000,000.The Cabinet-were informed that,, although, ever- a prc-liminary- summary of the statistical returns could not be mad-available &quot;before the middle of July, th^re was no reason tobelieve that the operation of the Act had resulted in any appreciable increase in arable land, or in a substantial increase in the production of wheat or oats.The Cabinet were reminded that the present Act wentfar short of the original measure proposed by the Governmentwhich had been drastically altered in the House of Lords.The Cabinet felt that it would be out of the question to continue to pay the heavy subsidies involved in the Actwithout adequate return in the form of an increase In corn production.After some further discussion, during which allusion,was made to the importance of agriculture in the ultimate-oalutiorL of-&apos;the- unemployment problem, the Cabinet agreed  
That. parliament sr^nt should be ashed tr rereadPart I &amp;f the Agriculture Act0.As regards the present year, the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and the Sec-re-tary for Scotland, acting i:\ close concert.,should he authorised to enter into a neg; -negotiation with the fo.iir.ers with a view to thepayment of a smaller sum than the presentcontingent liability.    This might beachieved by offering the farmer   the in-ducement of a certain cash payment duringthe present year, based r.n the acreageunder cultivation,  in lieu cf the paymentTinder the Act, which would net be made before March SI,  102S, and-would be based*in prices which always contained an element of uncertainty:The cuesticn of the price to be paid was left&quot;for arrangement between the Chancellorftf the Exchequer, the Minister of Agricul-ture and Fisheries, and the Secretary forScot land.
(2) With-referene-e&apos;&apos; to- Cabinet iX. (21), Conclusion       the&quot;Cabinet&quot;had &quot;before them a Report by the iihisb Situation Com-mittep  (Pap^r Ct?.-i&quot;a(:3) end a Memorandum by Dr, -Addiscn(Paper P.&quot;p.-295iQ) in regard to the Sittiati on in Ireland,After a full discussion the Cabinet agreed__(a) TVat Martial law should be proclaimed inthe 26 Counties, if the Southern Pailia-op-cnrieioricv fmm^6^M srwm^-(b) That reinforcements should be sent toIreland in as large numbers as possible and as early as the industrial situationin Britain admits,The Secretary of State for Warundertook to begin by sending2 Battalions a week:(e) &quot;^hat Sir Nevil Mac ready should take anearly opportunity of discussing with theNaval Commander-in-Chief the nature, ofthe Naval co-operation required, so thatthe Admiral may submit his plat..-5 to theAdmiralty:(d) That the Admiralty should place, so faras practicable, at disposal of theNaval Gomri.order-in-Ch.ief the force neces-sary to enable him to co-operate effect-ively with the Military Authorities incombined operations(e) That the Admiralty should be ask^d to -akeavomlable,,  if possible,  1 or more battalions of Marine  bo be placed at the disposal ofthe war Office for use in Ireland:(f) that   in all matters of policy in theadministration of Martial Law, the rilitaryGeneral Officer commanding-in-Ohihf should act under th* general directions of theOM^f Secretary for Ireland, who.   as the&quot;iire + ^r o^ the Crown responsible forde-ppndlnp the policy of tire Governmentin Parliament, must approve all Proelama-tions and Regulations on which the actionof the military forces is based,  and generally all questions that may be raised in the House of Commons.The precise terms of an understand-ihg to be based on this decision will be arranged between the chief secretary for Ireland and theSecretary of State for War.(g) That, in accordance with the above d-cision,the Chief Secretary should be authorised to notify the General Officer Com.&quot; auding-in-Chief that reprisals, which have already
practically ceased ...out side tie Martial&quot;-Law area, mast also cease within that area, and that aggressive action mustin every case he based on strictly-military grounds, defined by mil it.miorders.aryND.nter-ofs.(3) With reference to Cabinet 44 (SO), C conclusion 2.the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War on the subject of the internment of Irisrebels (Paper C..P.-2996)., in which he asked that, owing tothe fact that there is no more accommodation in Ireland,arrangements should be made for the reception of 2,000internees in this country.The Cabinet agreed  That, as a matter of policy, the Irishinternees should continue to be intern-ed in Ireland.INDUSTRIAL      (4) With reference to Cabinet 42 .(21), Conclusion 3.,ATION.the Cabinet took note that the Prime Minister, in accordancebilisa-of Re-es of royal, Army .RoyalForce.with the decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet 41 (21),  conclusion  (a), had approved the demob11iaation of the Reserves ofthe Royal JSavy, Army, and Royal Air Force.The Cabinet were asked for authority to pay the reserves the same gratuity of  5 per man as it had beendecided to pay to the Defence Force.   It was pointed out,however, that they were cnl;/ entitled to a much smaller sum,and the question was considered whether,  in the present financial position, it was justified to incur an expendi-tuxe nsjt far short of  500*000.    The objection to the coot,combined with the fact that it constituted a precedent thatmight prove inconvenient5 had to be balanced against the risktof disgruntling men on whom the security of the country hadrested, and, before long, might rest again.On a review of the question the Cabinet agreed -That a bonus of  5 should be paid tothe Reservists on demobilisation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,,W.-l,P__     June 2, 1921,
