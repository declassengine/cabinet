The time is not yet ripe for any definite offer or message to theAngora Government, but it would he most use-ful to get Information as to the exact pos-ition of the Angora Government vis-a-vis theentente and the Bolsheviks, and to warn it that the Angora Turks will have to choose&quot;between the dangerous influences of the Bol-shevlks and continued warfare on. the one hand,and peace and restored good-fellowship withthe ontento on the other.    In any caseHenry7s conversations are most useful.     TheSecretary of State for foreign Affairs iscommunicating your intentions to the frenohGovernment.The above suggestion was supported on the ground that,to establish contact through an informal and unofficial lineof ooxamunioatioia might be very valuable as a preliminary to,and for the purpose of preparing a suitable atmosphere for eventual official negotiations.It was strongly urged, however, that the assent of. Franceand Italy was an essential preliminary to any actien of thekind proposed,, that in dealing with orientals It was always a mistake to respond to overtures with too much alaerity; that itwould be essential to insist on Mustapha Kemal coming himself to Constantinople;: and that, if conversations took place, theyexperiencedshould be conducted by a^diplomatist, who should he of rankcorresponding to that of the Angora emissary. - .The Prime Minister proposed that In any conversations which might take place General Harington should he accompanied,by a diplomatist, such as Mr. Sattigan at Constantinople,The......
The Cabinet were very reluctant to miss an opperiranltyfor a conversation with Mustapha Kemal himself wbJJoh, it was generally felt^might prove useful, though they were notfavourably Inclined to conversations with secondary persons.They agreed that -As an essential preliminary to any action InTurkey in response to Mustapha KcmalK s over-turea&apos;   the Secretary of State for foreignAffairs should communicate tho facts to theFrench and Italian Governments and ascertaintheir attitude towards the suggestion.
(3) With reference to Cabinet 48 (21), Conc^TiBiotuJU^th^Cabinet were Informed-of^tlw-in^fl^ntTKWttton -of the coaldispute, and their attention was directed to the state ofthe coal stocks and the steps which were being taken toincrease them by imports from abroad.   The latter, it was stated, would provide supplies for vital services to theend of July,Tn regard to the negotiations, it was reported thatthe adverse result of the ballot had been a surprise to the moderate leaders, who now regretted their failure to give a lead to their supporters, the more so as someof the extremeleaders        had done so to their followers, despite anundertaking to remain neutral.    There were signs that at themeeting o** the Federation which was being summoned for Fridaynext the leaders would seek plenary powers to reopen negotia-tions with the owners, who would be presets   to extend their offer of a guarantee of minimum wages beyond June 30, 1922to December 31, 1922.    The owners had bewn informed that theGovernment was not prepared to renew its offer of  10,000,000,and the men had been told that the first essential was adefinite and agreed settlement with the owners.It was pointed out in the course of the discussion that a renewal of the Government&apos;s offer of  10,000,000 onthe o2Ld terms would be interpreted in many quarters as a sign of weakness and would be severely criticised,mh.^ Cabinet agreed -(a) To leave the negotiations to be conductedas hitherto by the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer, with thefullest latitude to take such measue aas would end the stoppage:(b) To approve the purchases of coal fromabroad made by the President of theBoard of Trade.

The Force numbered70,000 men and had been originally Intended, in conjunctionwith the Reserves, to meet dangers threatened by a general strike.    Such a strike was now improbableB and a Defence^erce of from ?0,000 to 40,000 should suffice to deal with,any troubles which might arise out of the Coal Strike.   Hecould secure the reduced numbers now required by re-engagingthe more essential units for a freah period.In view of the announcement which had just been made public of a meeting of the Miners&apos; Federation on Friday next,the Cabinet agreed  DEFENCE FORCE.      (4) Arising out of the foregoing discussion, the at ten-Terms of En-   tion of the Cabinet was called to the view of the Law officers that the men in the Defence Force had been enlisted yltra viresinasmuch as the Government had not power under the Army Actto be re-enacted for a fresh period.
