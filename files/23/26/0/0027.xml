While there was a divisionof opinion as to the real meaning of the letter, which bysome Ministers was thought to amount to a definite refusal to discuss any terms involving allegiance to the crown and by others to be in the main merely at attempt to save the face o^ the Sinn Fein leaders but not to preclude the wayto ultimate acceptance of the authority of the Crown, there-v?as complete unanimity as to its obscurity and its lack ofhistorical truth.    It was generally agreed that in framing their reply His Majesty&apos;s Government should be guided by the following considerations:-(i) The necessity of avoiding being drawn into afurther exchange of notes involving a series, of interminable arguments:111) The desirability, whilst giving both partiesa breathing space, of bringing matters to an issue at a definite date, in order to preventSinn Fein using the truce as a means of usurp-ing political power and further consolidatingtheir authority:       in this connection theCabinet were informed of the intentioh of SinnFein to Inaugurate an intensive campaign duringthe truce for the establishment of Sinn FeinClubs throughout Ireland:......Ciii) The desirability of retaining on the side ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government the opinion of this^country, of the world in general, and moderate opinion in Ireland.As regards the reply to be returned, there was general*agreementr-that it should be on the following lines:-/        (a ) It should begin by expressing regret at the* unhelpful character of Mr de Valera&apos;s letter:lb) It should then re-state the proposals of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and dilate upon the
magnitude of the concessions to Ireland and theactual power placed in the hands of the irish people:(c) Tt should make perfectly, clear that as regardsallegiance to the Crown and inclusion in theEmpire, His Majesty * s .-Government can admit no concession, and in this connection it shouldhe made clear that unconditional negotiationscannot be re-openedi!    to do so would be to ignore the negotiations; which hod occxirredand the letters which had been exchanged;His Majesty&apos;s Government would, however, beprepared, if the allegior.ee of Ireland to theCrown were admitted, to continue the negotia-tions for a final settlement:Kd) It should rebut the Untrue statement that Ire-land has never rendered allegiance to theBritish Crown, and 3hculd quote statements tothe contrary made by Irish leaders.The Cabinet agreed -To reassemble at 12.0 Noon on the following day to consider, in the light of previouscorrespondence with Mr de Valera and of theabove discussion, a draft reply on the&amp;bovelines which the Prime Minister undertook toprepare.

These telegrams0bowed that a very serious-situation had aris-en.,^ecpecially-in Malabar, where there were 700 native-casualties.   Pears&quot;w^re^xpreaeeu-^a^ uprisings must be anticipated in India and that there would be farther-demands on theavailable troops.The Cabinet took note of the statorrentmade by the Secretary of State for India.(3) In connection with the above discussions on Irishand Indian matters, the Cabinet-considered the question ofthe despatch of drafts to India.   Reference was made to thedecision of the Cabinet Committeeon Ireland to authorisethe Secretary of State for War &quot;in the event of the contem-plated contingency arising (i.e., the end of the truce) to suspend the despatch of drafts to India and to consider the prolongation by one year of the service of troops now inIndia&quot;.    The Secretary of State for India had informed theViceroy that at present drafts could not be allowed toleave for India in view of the Irish situation, and theViceroy had replied that he could not acquiesce in thispolicy unless the return of time-expired men were stopped.The Cabinet were informed that the decision of the- committee I on Ireland affected 10,000 troops, of whom 4-,200were due to sail for India on October 1, 1921, and would begiven embarkation leave on September 20, 1921,- whilst theremainder would sail in January.   Retention of these troops would dislocate the shipping programme of the War Officeand result in an increased expenditure of  640,000, sinceextra ship3 would be required.Incidental reference was made to the high cost of sending troops to India, Secretary of State for War
G announced that he was in consultation with the Board of trade as to the possibility of reducing this excessive cost.In view of the present deficiency cf troops in India(estimated at 4,000 men$ and of the proposed retention ofdrafts, it. would be necessary to retain tinierexpired men inIndia, and It was thought that this might be done by givingthe men so retained a special bonus of  50 each if they re-engagedin India and remained there, or by allowing them to re-engage forseveral years and granting them at the same time two monthsfurlough at home.Considerable objection was expressed to the suggestionthat a bonus should be given tc troops in. order to induce them to re-engage, since it was thought that the system ofbonuses would spread and involve great e xpense in the endr.It -was urged that the important thing was to treat the occurrencesin India seriously, since the disturbances might at any moment;spread to the whole of Southern India and cause a rebellion ofthe first magnitude *     In these . circumstances it would be improperto grant bonuses to men who were merely doing their duty.During the discussion reference was made,;to the possibilityof refraining from despatching further white troops to MesopotamiaThe Cabinet agreed(a) That the drafts for India due to leave thiscountry on October 1st, should not be despatchedwithout further instructions from the cabinet(b; That in the meantime the Commander-in-chief in &apos;India should have authority to retain there .all time-expired men?(e* That the Secretary of State for War shouldenquire into the high cost of transportingtroops to India, with a view ho redvicticn,if possible:(d) That the Secretaries of State fcr the colonies and for- War should consider the possibility&apos;sfsending no more drafts to Mesopotamia and constantinople respectivelya2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W\1.,August 25th, 1921,   (

REPLY RECEIVED FROM MR. de VALERA - 25th August, 1921.

Sir:-

The anticipatory judgment j: I gave in my reply of August 10th has been confirmed. I laid the proposals of your Government before DAIL EIRBEANN, and, by an unanimous vote, it has rejected them.

From your letter of August 13th it was clear that the principle we were asked to accept was that the geographical propin?ity" of Ireland to Britain imposed the condition of the subordination of Ireland&apos;s right to Britain&apos;s strategic interests as she conceives them, and that the very length and persistence of the efforts made in the past to compel Ireland&apos;s acquiescence in a foreign domination imposed the condition of acceptance of that domination now.

We cannot believe that your Government Intended to commit Itself to a principle of sheer militarism destructive of international morality and fatal to the world&apos;s peace. If a small nation&apos;s right to independence is forfeit when a more powerful neighbour covets its territory for the military or other advantages it is supposed to confer, there is an end to liberty. No longer can any small nation claim a right to a separate sovereign 

existence.
