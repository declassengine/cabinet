S,?c2 ?iL W cabinet had be-fore them a Memorandum by theSeore-tary of State for Foreign Affairs on the subject of thePanama Canal Tolls (Paper CP. &quot;VThe history of this question may be summarised verybri^^ly as follows:-Article 5 (1) of the Hay-Pauncafoto Treaty of 3fcy*wateer18th., 1901,    provided that the Canal should be free and opento the vessels of commerce and of war of all nations on termsof entire equality, and without discrimination.In 1912 an Act was passed in the United States ofAmerica containing a clause exempting American coastwise shipping from the tolls, though strong protests were made bythe British Government, with the support of the Canadian and australian Governments.After the passing of this law, further protests weremade by Sir Edward Grey, in which arbitration was suggested,but President Taffs Administration maintained the legality of their Act and evaded arbitration.President Wilson&apos;s Administration in 1914, however,took the opposite view, and passed an Act in June, 1914, re-pealing the provision for the exemption of United Statescoas-twis-e shipping.The present Administration has now returned to thepolicy of th* Taft Government, and ha^s   introduced a Billexempting American shipping from the tolls.    This Bill hasalready passed the House of Representatives and has beenreported to the Senate.The latest phase of the question was that the AmericaAmbassador had proposed that we should accept the introductiinto the Bill of a clause extending the same immunity asAmerican vessels were to enjoy to Canadian coastwise traffic the Cabinet were informed that this proposal was pre: j-dicial to British interests in so much as the exemption of canadian shipping, if added to that of American coastwiseshinning, which already included.places so distant as Cuba,&apos;U Hawaii and the Philippine Islands, would tend to increase t
Illtrlis for oeeaav-going shipping.    For the same reason therewas likely to be strong opposition from Australia and NewZealand.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question should be raised at anearly date at the Imperial Meetings:(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should confer at an earlydate with Mr Meighen on the subject:(c) That (unless Mr Churchill&apos;e interview with Mr Meighen gheu3d affect thedecision) at the imperial Meetings therepresentatives of the British Govern-ment should urge that the question shouldbe referred to arbitration.
1 j. 2STATUS OF THE       (2) With reference to Cabinet 22 (21), Appendix 111(10)SECRETARY FOR V      *iSCOTLAMD. the--cabinet.net were reminded that during the impending debate on the Scottish Estimates it was probable that the questionof the status and salary of the Secretary for Scotland wouldbe raised and attention called to the repeated declarationsof the Government on the matter.    The proposal to raise thestatus and salary of the Secretary would probably deceive the unanimous s\ipport of the Scottish Members, but might be oppos-ed by &quot;anti-waste&quot; Members, who would take advantage of theproposal, if made, to create prejudice against the Governmentquite independently of the merits of the question.    It was fully recognised that very specific declarations of theGovernment&apos;s intentions had been made by the Lord Chancollorin the House of Lords on behalf of the Government, but thatthe atmosphere at present was particularly unfavourable to proposals to increase ministerial salaries.The Cabinet agreed  That the Government Whips should ascertain,through the usual channels, whether or notthe proposal to raise the salary of theSecretary for Scotland would meet with opposition in the House of Commons.MESOPOTAMIA.      (3)    With reference to Cabinet 49 (21), Conclusion 1,the Secretary of Stato   for tho Colonies stated that, ac-cording to information&apos; just to hand, the Emir&apos; Feisal had been well received in Mesopotamia, and If the situationcontinued to develop favourably during tho next few weekshe would consult the -Secretary of State for War with a viewto accelerating the -withdratTal of troops.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,,1..4th July 1921..
