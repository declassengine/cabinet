,   - t &apos;3U43 SAFEGUARDING (1) With reference to Cabinet 61(21), Conclusion t?J industries^ the Lord Privy Seal consulted the Cabinet in regard tothe procedure to be adopted in the House of Commons inView of the action Of the House of Lords In amending the safeguarding of Industries Bill, notwithstanding thatthe Speaker had decided that it was a Money Bill, and,Under the Parliament Act, the Lords had no right to reject or amend it.The Lord Privy Seal had consulted the Speaker, whostated that the chair had no power to rule the amendments out of order.     One, course would be to movea Motion that the. House do not consider the Lords1Amendments, and the Speaker said this was permissible.The effect of this would be that the Bill would not go back to the House of Lords, but would become law if Par-liament were kept in being for a month.     The best course of all, however, appeared to be, first, to movethat the amendments be now considered, and, later,that they be not adapted.     *f a conciliatory attitude were adopted in moving the rejection ^f the amendments, the Lord Privy Seal hoped that the Lordsmight be willing to give way, thus avoiding theapplication of the Parliament ActiThe Cabinet agreed -To adopt the course proposed by the lord privy Seal, who was authorised to moveAmendments be now considered, snd,second, to move to disagree with them.
J u ^(2) With reference to Cabinet 69 (21), Conclusion 2Pthe &quot;Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet that the CabinetCommittee, which had met on the previous evening on thesubject of Irish Policy, had come to the conclusion that If,as seemed probable, the Government1s offer to Sinn Feinwas rejected and the truce came to an end^, a new policy would have to be adopted involving a series of militaryand civil measures of the greatest importance for which thesanction of Parliament would be required*      In thesecircumstances it appeared desirable net to prorogue Parlia-ment but to adjourn it to some date, a month or two hence,,on the understanding that Parliament might be summoned at short notice if affairs in Ireland should necessitate it.The Cabinet agreed -*(a) That his Majesty should be advised that parliament should not be prorogued for the present^, and thateonsequently no King8s Speech would be necessary.(b) Thatfoil owing; the precedent adapted in August,1920, at the time of the negotiations with Bol-shevist Russia, when a similar resolution wasadopted., the following resolution should be moved in.both Houses of Parliament.r&quot;That this House., at its rising this day, do adjourn -until Tuesday- October 18th, provided always thatif it appears to the satisfaction of Mr., Speaker(in the case of the House of Lords,, the LordChancellor), after consultation with His majesty&apos;s government^ that the public interest requires thatthe House should meet at any earlier time duringthe adjournment^ Mr. Speaker (in the case of theHouse of lord,&apos;the Lord Chancellor) may give notice that he is so satisfied., and thereuponthe House shall meet at the time stated in such notice, and shall transact Its business as ifit had been duly adjourned to that time&quot;0On re-assembly; the only business should be theemergency business for which Parliament was sum&quot;monedj and Prorogation,,(c) That the Lord Privy Seal and the Leader of theHouse of Lords should today announce in the two&apos;   Houses cf Parliament that a motion would be movedon the following day which wo-old give an opportunity -for a Debate on Ireland.fa) That, in order if possible to avoid two debates on Ireland, the Lord Privy Seal and the Leader ofthe House of Lords should notify the Leaders ofthe Various Parties privately cf the nature ofthe resolution to be mo ve d o(e) That the Clerk cf the Council should take His Maj-estyls pleasure with regard to arrangements for ameeting of the Privy Council for the cancellation of the Order-In-Council already passed in regardto Prorogation.
I     ft .I[IRELAND.

feE IMPERIAL,(4) With reference to Cabinet 68 ^21) , Conclusion 3,*the**CeWjriet -were infortaed that the ouee-tdon of the confer-ence onlYl^OTtrmswTnt and the abortive Pacific Conferencewaa likely to &quot;be raised in a Debate on a Motion   for the adjournment the same evening $ and that the Prime minister proposed to take the opportunity to make a statement inregard to the-recent  ---Imperial Conference.-4-
30POTAMIA. (5) With reference to Cabinet 45 (21), Conclusion 3, the[icy and Cabinet had before them the following Papers in regard toiance in32-28. Policy and Finance in MesopotamiaA Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies9 covering a Memorandum by the Chief ofthe Air Staff on the Air Force Scheme of control in Mesopotamia (Paper CP.-3197),A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(Paper CP,-3240) *The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretaryof State ^or War fully developed the conflicting arguments con-tained in their respective Memoranda.   The latter in particularstrongly criticised the plan of relying on the Royal Air Force forthe maintenance of order in Mesopotamia, which was regarded by his military advisors as unsound.While the cost of maintaining white troops in sufficient orce to ensure the defence of and the maintenance of order inMesopotamia against all contingencies was recognised to involve an expenditure beyond what Mesopotamia could afford^ and in excessof any grant-in-aid which Parliament would be prepared to sanction,the immediate withdrawal of the whole of the British troops and thesubstitution for them of Indian troops was agreed to be impraeticabl-.The question was raised as to whether, in existing financial conditions, the maintenance of our present position in Mesopotamiawas Justifiable.   Emphasis was laid on its unpopularity in the-country.    On the other hand, the view was expressed that if thematter were fully explained to Parliament and a free vote were taken, the Government*s policy would probably be supported.The suggestion was made that, with a view to reducing our commitments in Mesopotamia, the question should be oon-sidered of substituting a Treaty with the King-Rlect, the EmirFeisal, for the Mandate which had hitherto been contemplated,the draft of which was now before the League of Nations, andjunder which we should become responsible, inter aO-ia,, for thedefence of Mesopotamia.
While recognising that some risks might be involvedin their conclusion, the Cabinet,      appreciating, that itwas Impossible to insure completely against every risk,agreed --(&amp;) To take the following general decisionsasked for by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies:-(a) Full financial control of all expenditurein Mesopotamia to be vested in the ColonialOffice aa frora 1st October, 1981.lb)General Ironside to succeed General Haldaneon that data on a one year&apos;s commission, withthe definite task of inaugurating the AirForce scheme within IS months.(c) The garrison to be reduced to approximately8 or 9 battalions with, eyepry^hing..jsj3e,,reduced in due proportion by the end ofthe present financial year.(d) The Air Force scheme as outlined by air marshal Trenchard to be Inaugurated asfrom 1st October, 1983, all air and mili-tary forces in the country being responsiblethrough the Governor to the Colonial Office.(e) Any Indian troops required by the ColonialOffice from the 1st October, 1921, onward tobe paid for by direct arrangement between theColonial Office and the India Office.(f) The Estimates for 1922-25 should be framedupon the above basis, i,e., the 8 or 9battalion scheme with reduced administrative,staffs ruling for the first half of thefinancial year, and being succeeded for thesecond half by the 4-battalion Royal AirForce scheme.(g) All arrears of expense and other capitalcharges already incurred to be settledwithout fail within the present financialyear, thus enabling a fair start to bemade in 1922-25.i (The Secretary of State for War, while statingI hie intention loyally to carry cut the decisions(I of the Cabinet, asked that his dissent from&apos; this policy might be recorded.)ill)That the above decisions should, as contem-plated by the Secretary of State for the Col-colonies (Para.8 of I.C.P.-S197) be &quot;withoutprejudice to the over-riding and persistentright and duty of the General Staff to preventtheir troops from being placed in positionswhich they consider&apos;unduly dangerous, or under conditions   detrimental to their health orefficiency&quot;.The Secretary of State ftsr War undertook thatthe War Office should interpret this provisionreasonably.
viii) l&apos;mt the Secretary ox&quot; State xor War-, xnoonmi.lt at ion with the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, should examine the pos-sihility of releasing British troops,whether Infantry or Cavalry, from Mesopo-tamia, for service In Ii*eland.(iv) That the Secretary of State -^or Foreign Affairs,the Secretary of State for India,the Minister of Education,should consult withthe Secretary of State for the colonies in regard to the proposed Treaty with theKing-Fleet, the Emir Feisal, and its effecton the Mandate.    They were asked to refer to the Cabinet if they deemed it necessary.
With reference to Cabinet 45 (21)( Conclusion 2 (a)the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies dealing with the situation in Palestine(Paper CP.-321S) .The Cabinet were informed that recent reports from palestine were of a disturbing character.   Arabs and Jewswere armed, or were arming, and a conf11 ft might shortlyensue, particularly if the Moslem Christian Delegation, nowin London, returned without having secured the withdrawalof Mr Balfour&apos;s pledge to the Zionists.    The latter werenaturally anxious as to their position, and wished to bereassured as to the Government&apos;e support.   Two courses were open to the Cabinet.    They could withdraw from their Declara-tion, re^er the Mandate back to the League of Nations^ setup an Arab National Government, and slow down or stop the imni-gration of Jews:    or they could carry out the present policy with greater vigour and emeourage the arming of the Jewswith a view later on of reducing the numbers of the british garrison and cutting down expenses.   A draft pronouncement,prepared by Dr Weizmann was read, for which he desiredofficial approval, but objection was taken to its terms, and,in particular, to placing the control of immigration in thehands of the Jews and limiting it by the funds available.In the course of the discussion which followed, stresswas laid on the following considerations:-The honoTir of the Government was involvedin the Declaration made by Mr Balfour, andto go back on our pledge would seriously ra-duce the prestige of this country in the eyes of Jews throughout the.world.(ii) The Prime Ministers of Canada and SotithAfrica had recently stated that our Zionistpolicy had proved helpful in those Dominions:(iii) It was not expected that the problem couldbe easily or quickly solved, especially inview of the growing power of the Arabs inthe territories bordering on Palestine:(iv) On the other hand, it was urged that peacewas impossible on the lines of the balfour declaration, which involved setting up aNational Home for the Jews and respecting
the rights of the Arab population.   Theresult of this inconsistency must be toestrange both Arabs and Jews,, while ln-volving us in futile military expenditure.Against this position it was argued thatthe Arabs hadno prescriptive right to a country which they had failed to developto the best advantage.The&quot;&quot;Cabinet agreed  In view Of the absence of Mr Balfour,to adjourn the discussion.-9-
(7)   With reference to Cabinet 38 (2l), conclusion (b), the Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chairman^Sir Eri6 Geddes, covering the Interim Report of theCommittee appointed to consider the decentralisation ofthe Housing of Government Staffs  Paper CtPo3G51)aThe Cabinet agreed(a) To take note of the Reports(b) To approve the appointment by theTreasury of the following committee sir Charles M, de Bartolome (Chairman)(Ministry of Transporte))A Representative of the Office of WorkseMr0 Meiklejohn,(Treasury..)nTo investigates on behalf of the Treasury,the work of all Government departments in the London area, and to recommend whatDepartments or sections of Departments, ..oould be moved to an area beyond a two-mileradius from Whitehall&quot;.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.18th August, 1921.
