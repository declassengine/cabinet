UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.



(1) With reference to Appendix I (3), the Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Unemployment Insurance:-



A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-?),

The Report of the Cabinet Committee (Paper C.P.-2663?).

In the course of a somewhat prolonged discussion the Cabinet were reminded that the present unemployment, which had ?set the financial equilibrium of the Unemployment Fund, was abnormal, due to exceptional circumstances, and greatly aggravated by the Chal Strike, which had tended to postpone the recovery of trade. The Suggestion was made that the proper way to meet these special conditions was by the imposition of a special levy.

The Cabinet agreed -

(a) That a Cabinet Committee, com? of

Dr. Addi? (in the Chair), The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The Secretary of State for War, The Minister of Health, The Minister of Labour, The Secretary for Scotland,

Mr Pembroke Wicks (Secretary), should re-examine the question of super-imposing on the existing Scheme of Unemployment Insurance a temporary emergency scheme to meet the abnormal unemployment situation created by the Coal Strike, and based on such provisional increase of contribution by employers and employed as the ? calculations may prove necessary:

(b) T?, in view of the very strong pressure which is certain to be brought to bear, the Committee should include a consideration of the means for providing for an extension of the 16 week&apos;s benefit, which will, towards the end of July, expire for ? workpeople:

(c) That the Committee should proceed with utmost expedition, and that for the moment the printing of the additional insurance stamps required to provide for the contingency of an additional contribution should be suspended:

(d) That the consideration of provision for a possible permanent unemployment problem on an increased scale, owing to the prolonged lack of purchasing power in foreign markets, should be postponed for the present.
