ALBANIA.        (1) Arising out of a Parliamentary questionaddressed to the Prime Minister by Lord Robert Cecil,the Cabinet were informed that the Council of theLeague of Nations had recently considered the differences between Albania and her neighboursIn regard to frontiers,  sand that, inasmuch asthe boundaries of Albania were a legacy of theLondon Conference and the Peace Conference, theCouncil had decided that the question was one for the Allied Powers^     It was about to beconsidered by the Conference of AmbassadorsIn Paris.The Cabinet agreedThat the reply to theQuestion should be given bythe Lord President of theCouncil, who deals with questions relating to theLeague of Nations*1
RENEWAL of the AMQLO-japanese alliance.(2) With reference to Cabinet 43 (21), Conclusion 2, theCabinet met to consider the attitude to be taken up by thePrime Minister and his colleagues of the Eritish government at the Imperial meetings at which the question of the renew-al of the Anglos-Japanese Alliance was being discussed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave tothe Cabinet a summary of the changes which had taken placein the situation since the-...question was last discussed some three weeks previously, and also explained the attitude whichhad been taken up by the Prime Ministers of the variousDominions (See Stenographic Notes of the 6th, 9th and 10thMeetings..which have been circulated to the Cabinet). Briefly,Mr Meighen,  the Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada,   .had opposed the renewal of the Treaty even more stronglythan had been anticipated.    He had emphasized the very strong opposition in America to the renewal of the Alliance,and had given the impression that the Canadian Government would be unable to agree to any form of exclusive Agreement with Japan,and that Canada would have to dissociate herself from adecision to enter into any such Agreement.    Mr Hughes andMr Massey% on the other hand, had rebutted Mr Meighen&apos;3arguments and had supported the renewal of the Alliance.They had pointed out that by throwing over a friend who hadstood by them in the late War the British Empire would earnthe contempt of the world at large, and that such actioninstead of raising would probably lower the British people in the estimation of the American public. . GeneralSnrats had made a thoughtful speech^ but had adopted a some--what. balancing attitude which was half helpful and halfembarrassing.    The general points made by General Smuts hadbeen that we must do nothing to antagonise Japan, the Prussiaof the East, while maintaining good relations with the UniteoStates of America.    General Smuts seemed, on the whole,inclined to favour a discussion with Japan and the UnitedStates o-f America, leading to an exchange of identic notes.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thencalled attention to a new factor which had arisen since theCabinet last considered the question, and that was that theBritish Ambassador   in Washington (Sir Auckland Geddes), whohad originally advised a renewal of the Alliance, had, on the6th of June of this year, advised the substitution of a tripartite arrangement, and, again, on June 24th. had reported a conversation with the American Secretary of State, when ithad been made clear that the renewal of the Alliance wouldhave very serious effects on American opinion;   further, thatit was unlikely that the American Senate would ratify a treaty between the United States, Japan aiid Great Britain.    At the conversation in question a proposal had emerged for the sub-stitution for the Treaty of a declaration of policy embodied in identic notes to be exchanged by the American, British and japanese Governments (Telegram Mo..486 D, , dated June 24,.. 1921,from the British, Ambassador at Jjyashingtpr.).    In addition, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinetthat he had had an important conversation with the american ambassador in London, which had shown that the United StatesGovernment wei&amp;e quite willing to discuss the matter Histook the initiative, -        ,  .Majesty&apos;s Government/   Lora Curzon then referred to thevarious alternative proposals which had been made as asolution of the question, during which he expressed some doubt as to whether the Japanese Government would be likely to agreeto the proposal for the issue of identic notes by tho three powers, and he called attention to the fact that the greatest difficulty at the moment was that His Majesty&apos;s government did not know exactly what views were held by the American and japanese Governments.    In the circumstances, Lord Curzonsuggested-that he should he allowed to approach the japanese and United States Ambassadors, and, while explaining to themfrankly the difficulties with which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere faced, ash them to ascertain the views of their respect-ive Governments.    If this were done, he (Lord Curzon) wouldlike to suspend for a short time the-discussion of the question-3-
with, &quot;the Dominion. Prime Ministers.During the discussion which followed, it was pointedout that, looking at the question from a strategic point ofview, there could &quot;be no war between America and Japan in thenext few years, as, for want of naval bases, neither power could operate against the shores of the other, so thatGreat Britain was reallyJaoanthe only Power which/      could attach.    It was true that shecotild occupy the Philippines, but this would be almost more to the disadvantage of Great Britain than to that of theUnited States.    Looking at the diplomatic aspect of the ques-tion, it was suggested that the matter might be regarded from two points of view;    firstly, from that of Australia and NewZealand and the other islands in that part of the   Pacific,and, secondly, the Par Past, including China.    As regardsthe latter it might be possible to enter into a defensiveAlliance with Japan against any European Power or combination of European Powers.    Regarding the other/part of the question, .there might be a tripartite arrangement which would includethe whole of the Pacific, following the British point of viewregarding the &quot;open door&quot;.After some further discussion, during which attention was called to the importance 0? bearing in mind that Japanmight resent being thrown over, the Prime Minister summed upthe question, pointing out that there were certain fundamentalpoints which had to be adhered to, viz:-(i)  Great Britain could not quarrel with theUnited States of America:(ii) It was essential not to insult Japan bydoinp anything which would be tantamount to casting her aside after the loyal way in which she had observed the Treaty inthe past:(iii) China must be carried with us and be a party to any conversation.The Prime Minister then called attention to the remarks madeby Sir ^dward Grey at the Imperial Conference in 1911, when
the latter had pointed out the effect the termination of the alliance would have upon Anglo-Japanese relations;    andemphasized the faot that since then Japan had rendered,enormous services to the British Empire during the War,when, without her assistance, the Allies would have been deprived of the use of something,   like 1,600,000 men inthe main theatres of operation.    Further, the Prime Minis to-emphasized the fact that Japan had come into the War not because she was an enemy of Germany, nor because of herfriendship with France, tut because she was Britain&apos;s Ally;and even in this capacity it was very doubtful if she wasunder any obligation to do what she had done.    To cast off,in the manner suggested, a Power which had stood by us likeJapan was to his mind an Inconceivable action, and he regard-ftd &amp;t as fundamental that Japan should not be insulted.Again, as regards America, in his opinion they were evenmore concerned about the future of Yap than about the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and if the British Government could do anything in assisting to find a solution to that problemit certainly ought to be done.    Referring to China, thePrime Minister called attention to the fact that this countywas just awaking, and that whereas the amount of trade inChina was only  1 per head of the population, in Japan it was something like  10 per head, and there were possibilitiesthat trade in China might eventually total  4,000,000,000.It was essential, therefore, that we should not leave Chinato be walked over by America and for the latter country toget the whole benefit of China&apos;s trade. Regarding the ques-tion of the renewal of the Alliance, although it had been assumed that the communication which had been sent to theLeague of Nations was tantamount to denouncing that Alliance,he wondered whether it would not be possible now to get outof the difficulty by saying to Japan either that we would withdraw that notification or treat it as not being a
1   \ jdenunciation tJf &quot;&quot;the^JLLliance^^JXMdiie^-were tLone-J.t&apos;Wouldmodify the situation considerably/ and Mr, Meighen, insteadof pleading for the non-renewal of the Alliance, would haveto plead for the issue of a notice denouncing it.     Hispoint was that if the British Government and Japan agreedthat the Treaty still held goad, it would then be a question as to whether we should give notice of its determinationor not, and this would depend en the result of theConference     hich it was suggested   should be held betweenthe Powers concerned.After some further discussion with the LordChancellor as to-the legal position in connection withthe natice given tr* the League of Nations, the cabinet agreed----(a) That the representatives of the UnitedKingdom at the Imperial Meetings shouldhave authority to propose or assent tothe initiation of full and frankconversations with the Governments ofboth the United States of America and japan with a view to some arrangementsatisfactory to all parties;(b) That, in *^rder, if possible, to gain timefor those conversations witheut thenecessity of taking the overt step cf atemporary renewal of tho Treaty, to whichthe Canadian Government objected, theLord Chancellor should be asked to give an opinion as tn whether the noticegiven to the League ef Nations in regardto the Anglo-Japanese Alliance must inevitably be held as equivalent to a denunciation of the Treaty of 1911;(c) That the Foreign Office should be askedto transmit all the necessary papers,with the least possible delay to theLord Chancellor, whs should, if possible,attend the Meeting of the Representativesof the United Kingdom, the Dominions and :yIndia, that afternoon, and be ready togive his opinion.
prNAl-IAL (3) With reference to Cabinet 80 (SO), Conclusion 6, theIjNDITION)P AUSTRIA^   Cabinet were informed - by the Lord President of the council that he had seen the Governor of the Bank of England relative to the arrangements for the rehabilitation of Austria,Although the funds raised for the purpose had been mainlycontributed by Great Britain and tho United States ofAmerica (Prance&apos;s.contribution- being negligible), Prancehad managed to give the impression that the money came from her.    It was eminently desirable that the funds should infuture be under the control of some international body, or,s oroefailing that, of saph neutral,  such as a Dutchman.    If theneutral countries like Holland and Sweden were- approachedthere was reason to believe that substantial financialassistance for Austria might be forthcoming.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat the question had been under consideration by the Expertswho had hitherto failed to reach any conclusions.    It waspossible that a meeting of Inter-Allied Experts would beheld shortly, when this and other matters could be discussed.He would take an early opportunity of speaking to theGovernor on the subject.
I       , i p*BADE B6ABD (4) The Cabinet &quot;had under consideration the ConclusionsOLIO   t-- reach-d by the Home Affairs Committee (H.A.C. 90 (2) ) at theates Fro-Dsed by meeting on June 29th, 1921, on the question of the rates pro-rocerycade Board,   posed by the Grocery Trade Board, which was to the effect that,having regard to the wording of Section 4 (2) of the trade board Act, 1918, the Minister of Labour had no discretionand was legally obliged to confirm the order made by theBoard in the circumstances stated by the Minister of Labour.The Cabinet were informed of the facts of the case as stated in the Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (paper cp.-3078), and it was pointed out that if the rates were now confirmed great difficulties would arise, particularlyin the rural areas and in colliery districts especially,inasmuch as the rates were admittedly fixed when the costof living was very much higher than at present.    On the otherhand, it was pointed out that the Trade Board in question was ready to consider revised rates, though such rates could notbe brought into force for some months:    that the Minister ofLabour was in no sense a Court of Appeal from the Trade Boardand could only affirm the rate or send it bach to the board for reconsideration;    that the Board would probably resignif the rate was not confirmed, and that the employees would represent failure to confirm as evidence of a plan to depresswages.There was general agreement with the view that theTrade board procedure was inappropriate to the DistributionTrades, and it was suggested that the Minister of Labourmight confirm the findings of the Trade Board so far asrelated to areas of over 10,000 inhabitants, but should at;; the same time ask the Board to reconsider their findingsas regards areas of under 5,000 inhabitants, inasmuch asthey were in fact reconsidering the position as regards theareas of 5,000 - 10,000 inhabitants.    On the other hand itwas pointed out that there was considerable opposition fromthe smaller employers in the highly populated areas.
0 The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Labour should refer the whole matter back again to the trade board for further consideration, andshould at the same time inform the Boardof all the circumstances, such as badtrade, unemployment, fall in the costof living, etc., which, in his opinion,rendered necessary reconsideration ofthe rates.(21)IRELAND. (5)   With reference to Cabinet 53/Conclusion 1,the Cabinet rare informed that the Dublin newspapersof Sinn Fein sympathies, like the&quot;Freeman&apos;s Journal&quot;,while commenting adversely on Sir James Craig&apos;refusal to meet Mr. de Valora, had refrained frommentioning the latter&apos;s telegraphic reply indicating that Sinn Fein could not accept the Prime Minister&apos;proposal in its present form,     The importance offurnishing the Cabinet with as early informationas possible of the developments in Ireland was emphasised.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 30th, 1921.
