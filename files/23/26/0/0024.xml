During the meeting a message wasreceived to the effect that the Labour Party was unable todo this .In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed  That it would be wiser to avoid a debate in either House in present circumstances.P &apos;NOTE.     A copy of Mr de Valer&apos;s speech, as given in the&quot;Daily News1&apos;, is attached in the Appendix.-1-

APP??TDIX TO CABIESVT 69(?l).REPORT 0? BY MR.. DS! VALSRA AT A 1 e?.TI1TG OjT TK5BAIL StRSilTIv QI-T TUMoAf, AUGUST ISth,  1921.(Extracted from the &quot;Daily ggwgj [ August 17th, 1921.) ...&quot;It is not my purpose to deal with the main part o&apos;f our&apos;work to-day.    I think it is only necessary at this stage that vre should understand the programme for this session.In the morning I intend to give an account of my department,and in a general way of the negotiations that have takenplace between your Ministry, the Ministry of the Ite.il, -andthe British Government.REPLY TO BRITAIN.tt*hen we have finished that the ministers will all giveaccounts of their own departments and you will be able to.judge from their accounts how far they have been able not-withstanding the&apos;presence of an enemy in.our midst to carryon the nation&apos;s work.&quot;The reply which we propose sending from this na-tion to.the British Prime Minister and his Government will be dis-cussed in a private session.   You. all understand the seriousness of that reply.&quot; You all understand that it is intended by theBritish Government &quot;to make that an&apos; issue of peace or war&quot;with this&apos; nation.nHence it is that we have to discuss that matter firstin private.   Later on, when the reply is sanctioned and ready for dispatch, you will have here another publicsession, at which you will have certain elections such as you-had today.    Then, following on that, we shall havethe propositions of the new Ministry.&quot;That is our programme and. I have said I do not intend to go fully into oUr work here this morning.   At the sametime -I&apos;- think it is only right at the first session of thenew Dail that we should look back upon the work of theBail that has just ended.-&quot;Two and, a half years ago, you know the old Bail waselected as an expression of the will of the Irish nation.In a General Election which was in effect a plebiscite thequestion was put to the Irish people what form of government they wanted, how they wished to live so that they mighthave an opportunity of working out for themselves their ownnational life in their own way.BSSgyCB OP PRggDOM.&quot; And the answer that the people gave was unmistakable.    I;&amp;p not say that answer was for a form of Government so much-&quot;^because we are not Republican doctrinaires    - but it was foIrisX. freedom-and Irish lnd.epend.ence, and. it was obvious to everyone who considered the question that Irish independence:could not. b-e realised at the present time^in any other wayso suitably; as. through a Republic,
-Hence it was that the Irish Republic as ouch was sanction-40      ed by the representatives of the people, and that you, therepresentatives of the people, came here and in public sessionsolemnly declared your determination that you would give yourlives and everything you had in the endeavour to make thatexpression of the people effective, so that you world havenot merely in your own hearts a recognition of it, but thatyou might secure the recognition of it from every nationthroughout the earth.HISSIOF TO THl TORLD.&quot; The first duty, therefore,  of the Ministry was to setabout making that de jure republic a de facto republic.   you had to set about that by getting control of all the national and public affairs of the nation and by sending your repre-sentatives abroad that they might tell the peoples of theworld what your rights were, what you had done, and what youexpected of them.&quot;They went forthm every one of them,  on a mi 3 si on whichwas a mission not merely fbr this country, but for tho whole world.    They went out,  everyone of them,  feeling that thoywere apostles to see that the work and. the ideals for whichsacrifices were made through five or six years of war werenot lost.&quot;Everyone of them as they spoke in foreign lands feltthat they were speaking not alone for the freedom of thiscountry, but that they were speaking for the freedom of mankind, for human progress, and for the -progress of eivilisa-tti on everywhere.&quot;Certainly in America, speaking of my own knowledge, I felt that when I spoke for Ireland&quot;there I was speaking tothe youth of America,  to the soldiers of America who had.gone out across the water to fight in Prance and elsewherefor the ideals which were enshrined in the American De-claration of Independence.WHAT TI-TTV &quot;BOUGHT &quot;FOR.&quot;These same ideals were the ideals we stand for.    It isscarcely necessary - I have quotations here by the score -to show you that the world was deceived in the great war, atleast that those who went to fight in it were deceived by those who sent thorn to fight.&quot;They were told, these men.who went to give up their lives,that they were not going to fight for empires, but for thefreedom of peoples.    They were told to go to France and toFlanders, and that they might fight for the rights of nations,great and small, to live their own lives according to theirown will.&quot;They gave up their lives, millions of homes have beenruined throughout the world, and millions of money have been lost in order, as those who made the sacrifice thought, toestablish.a reign of government by the consent of thegoverned.THE PARIS COKFERBHCJB.,&quot;You know what happened at Paris when the last Dail came into session.    The Peace. Conference was still on, and you had hopes that those who expressed sentiments such as were expressed not by President Wilson alone&apos;, but by English
Ministers, who seemed to.have had the most to say at that conference, would not lose sight of the principles whichthey had proclaimed, and for which they had called forsacrifices from the peoples 4&quot;And it was in preparation for that right of self-determination which you had exercised that you proclaimed,here that Ireland wished to live its own life as anindependent country,&apos;when the Ministry proclaimed its policy here after therelease df a number of us who were in prison they pro-claimed it in words which were an adaptation of CardinalMercier&apos;s words in reference to Belgium,&quot;It is no harm to read those words again here to-day,because it was those words which governed our policy as aMinistry.then and govern our policy as a Ministry still.He said and we say now:&quot;The authority of that power is no lawful authority.Therefore in soul   and conscienceThe irish people owethat authority neither respect nor attachment nor   4obedience.    The sole authority in this country is theauthority, of our own Government - the&quot; authority of elected representatives&apos;of the&quot; Irish nation;    this authority alone has the right to our affection and tootfr submission.&quot; The acts of the usuper have in themselves no authority^, and such of those Acts as affect thefeneral interests and to which we may give ratifica-ion will have__authority only in virtue of suchratification which alOne gives them juridic value.that was our policy.    It is the policy we have actedon, and please God it is the policy that we intend acting,up to.   That has reference to our action at home*   I statedthat our representatives went abroad as apostles of liberty.Their success with the peoples has. been what one would expect-.,of the peoples.    They wished to hear those sentiments once more expressed because in their hearts they feared that&apos; theywere about to be forgotten for ev*r.&quot;They feared that a callous cynicism was about to replace them and that it was only in the stress of war that peoples,and governments Ih particular, were likely to pay any atten-tion to them.nit was because of that - because of Ireland&apos;s inherentright - that our people were listened to and the peoplesrecognised that the only lawful authority here in ireland was the Government of the Republic of Ireland.SliLF-RSOOGaHTION,&quot;In the hearts of the people of these countries there-fore, the Republic is recognised.   We.recognise it, and itis only on the basis of our self-recognition of that that wedeal with any foreign Power whatever.&quot;Mr, de Valera proceeded to quote at soma length fromthe speeches of President TLlson on the aims of Americaand the Allies in the European war, pointing out that if the justice/
justice of those airs was accepted - as. it had been by 3*:r.Lloyd George     there would be no need whatever for negotia-tions between Britain and Ireland,&quot;We stand for principle, and we mean to die for it ifnecessary.I am more or les3 trespassing on what I wanted tospeale&quot; about&quot;To^raorrQw]]T^hl&apos;\ say that it is irapo s s i blepractically for I re land to nego tiatei with the British,Government. &quot;I pointed out before, when we were asked why we did, not negotiate, why that, was, and I said therecan be no negotiation with a man or with a Govern-merit or with a Power, when^the po^ition^is that ofone who is an unarmed manpracticaliy^ facing a man with a pistol -pointed at his&apos;head.i&quot;BAYING PACES&quot; .&quot;When you have no principle to fall back upon, a principle by which you can regulate and adjust your differences, you have nothing to fall back upon but force, and in the end ifthe British.Government does not state definitely someprinciple that it stands by, then when Irishmen come tonegotiate with Britain they find that at every step theyare confronted with that principle and that force, and there--fore negotiation with Britain, for the most part, meansnothing.iiAll they mean is an opportunity of saving frees.    Wedo not negotiate to save faces.    We negotiate to save blood-shed if we can, but we can only negotiate on right and on principle.&quot;We are asked, when we said we would negotiate on theprinciple, on the basis of Justied, we are asked what isjustice?    It may be difficult to give an abstract definition of justice that would be applicable in every case-.SMALL NATIONS.&quot;But it does not require much for the average- man+,0, see what is just and what is not just - and it is not just?a smallnation beside a big one.should be giving guarantees for the safety of the big one instead of the big one giving guaran-tees for the safety of the little one.&quot;Uor is it difficult to see that if you admit the princi-ple that because a big nation thinks that a small nationbeside it i3 necessary for its advantage and for its safetyor security, and that if that makes it possible to claim that that small nation should be annexed, it is not diffi-cult to see that it would not be long before we would haveno small nations in Europe.&quot;If big Empires can claim to grab- xvp those small nationsbeside them for their interest then undoubtedly it would bethat the small nations which did so much for the world andwhich the British Prime Minister talked so much, about would cease to exist.&quot;It is not fair to say., therefore,  that there is anyjustice in that.    There is no right in that.    If I were totake in detail the British proposals I could prove also thatthey are not just, and it is because they are not just that/e sent the reply that we have sent.&quot;
