(6 ) With reference to Cabinet 56 (21) Conclusion 5,*fchue&quot;pn.Tnfi-Mirtifrter.i.nfjormea&quot; the-Cabinet that, after three interviews with Mr de Valera, aggregatingseveral hours, he found it difficult to say exactlywhere the Irish, leader- stood.   His general impression was: that both Mr de Valera and Sir James Craig wouldlike a settlement but they were afraid of their supporters.Mr de Valera, who had an agreeable personality,had reached the stage of asking questions in regard tosuch matters as the entry of South Ireland into theEmpire, swearing allegiance, the form of the oath, thename of the new State, and so forth.     What he wantedwas a republic, but this the Prime Minister had saidwas impossible being inconsistent with the monarchy.Mr de Valera however had not admitted this inconsist-ency.The prime Minister had kept carefully within theterms laid down by the Cabinet on Hay 25th (Cabinet42 (21) Conclusion 2\, except in one respect, namely,in regard to the army.    In this matter Sir James Cralghad insisted that, for the maintenance of order inNorthern Ireland, he must have a territorial force,and the Prime Minister had felt that, subject to a limitation of numbers, this should be conceded.As the conversation progressed it became increasingly clear that Ulster was the real difficulty.Was there to be fiscal autonomy for Ireland?   Was thereto be a Parliament for the whole of Ireland, and, if so, was it to be composed ox an equal number ofrepresentatives of northern and Southern Ireland on thelines of the Council of Ireland under the Government oforIreland Act/of numbers proportional to the respective
&quot;populations?     Sir James had made it clear that in no circumstances would northern Ireland agree to a singleParliament for all Ireland on this latter basis.     This, hehad said, would enable Southern Ireland to impose taxation,to collect it, and to pack the fiscal administration withSinn leiners and Roman Catholics.The Prime Linistor had pointed out to Lr de Valera thatinsistence on this would result in Southern Ireland being placed, in the same relation to Northern Ireland as GreatBritain now occupied towards Southern Ireland.    It might result in civil war, each part of Ireland drawing supportersfrom its kindred in the Dominions, 30 that eventually thewhole &quot;Jmpire would be implicated.     Lr de Valera had statedthat Southern Ireland would never allow itself to be implieat-ed in civil war.     It would rather let Northern Ireland alone,on which the Prime llinister had commented by asking why theywould not now leave bister alone.Lr de Valera had criticised the Prime i:inister&apos;s proposals on the ground that, while conceding something, they took muchsway, e.g., in regard to the liavy and Air Porce.     Mr de valera had eventually intimated that lie must consult his&quot;Cabinet&quot; only two members of which were with him in London.It appeared desirable therefore that a statement of theproposals of the British Government should now be communication-ed to for de Valera.     This had been drawn up by the PrimeMinister, in collaboration with tho 3Jord Privy Seal (forChamberlain) and the Lord President of the Council (Lr Balfour)*In order to avoid almost continual meetings of the Cabinet atthe shortest notice he had ventured to confer with PrChamberlain and lir Balfour during these conversations, whichLr de Valera had insisted on conducting with himself alone inspite of his&apos;own request for a larger conference.     Sir james craig had seen an early draft, but had intimated that it would
be better that he should not be asked to take any respcnsib-ility in this matter.The Lord Privy Seal then read to the Cabinet the first draft of the statement, which was shortly afterwardscommunicated to every member of the Cabinet.     The PrimeMinister explained that he had undertaken to shew the document to the Ling immediately after the meeting and tocommunicate a statement to 13? de Valera to-night.   It was ofthe first importance to carry out this latter undertaking.(At this point there was an adjournment for a quarter of an hour to enable members of theCabinet to read the draft.)In the subsequent discussion various verbal alterationswere agreed to.Referring to the passage at the bottom of page 2 that ireland &quot;shall maintain her own military forces for HomeDefence, her own Constabulary and her own Police&quot; the cabinet agreed that this would $ot exempt the British Government fromtheir obligation, provided for in the Government of Irelandofficers and men of theAct, to provide for the future of the/existing Royal irish constabulary and Police.Some discussion took place in regard to the expediency of using the word &quot;Treaty&quot; on page 5.     It was suggested thatthe word &quot;Pact&quot; would be preferable, on the ground that the useof the word &quot;Treaty&quot; would furnish a precedent fraught withdanger, involving recognition of an existing Irish Republic andwhich it might prove impossible to resist in the case of India.On the other hand reference was made to the Treaty of LimerickThe Cabinet having been assured by the prime kinister thatthis was regarded by the Sinn Peiners as an essential element in the negotiations, and by the Attorney General that therewas no essential difference between a treaty and a pact from
0tho point of view of the position which would arise shouldthe negotiations &quot;break down     1 agreed -to substitute tho words -?Tin the form of aTreaty&quot; in lines &apos;6 and 4, page 5, and&quot;instrument-&quot; on line 5, page 5.;kLioy in     (2)     On the clear understanding that, in the event of asegard toPublicationJbreakdown in the Irish negotiations, the British Governmentof theStatement,   were at liberty to publish the statement of their proposals,tho Cabinet gave the prime Minister full discretion todecide, after his next conversation with Mr de Valera,on the question of immediate publication.ositiontheBruce ifjegotiat-bnstokenf.lilitaryjfolioy infie eventI aleakingIf ofIgotiat-oas.(3)     The Cabinet were informed that a large number of thegarrison and police of Ireland were at present on leave.In the event of a sudden rupture of the truce therefore these forces would be at a disadvantage.     Should the contingency of an interruption of negotiations appear probable, thePrime liinister was asked to try and avoid any sudden ruptureof the truce.(4)     In the course of the discussion on the statement of theGovernments policy, the Prime Minister had mentioned that hehad given Mr de Valera a very serious warning that, if dis-order broke out again, the struggle would bear an entirely different character.     British military commitments indifferent parts of the world were gradually being reduced,which had enabled the Government to concentrate their forcesat horne.   as it was immaterial whether they were tniartered inGreat Britain or Ireland they would be sent to the latter
country, where a great military concentration wouldtake place with a view to the suppression of the rebellion and the restoration of order.!Pho Secretary of State for &quot;..ar later warned the Cabinetthat he would require a number of military decisions ofgreat urgency to provide for tha contingency of a breakingoff of the negotiations with Sinn I?oin.
(5) The C&amp;blrmOx&amp;dT^a-f^^ to thefuture business of the House of Commons during the present-&apos;Session of Parliament.They were informed that, in order to carry throughthe rxe-oeaaary inrograrame wf &quot;business without resort to an^Autumn Session, it would be necessary for the Government on tuesday next to ask the House of Commons to suspend the11 o&apos;clock Rule until the end of the Sessian,   The leadersof the Parliamentary Op-position, when shown the programme,had expressed their Intention of opposing it with all themeans at their disposal, in order to force an Autumn Session.The Lord Privy Seal emphasized the importance of avoiding another Government defeat, such as had occurred onthe previous evening, and the Prime Minister drew attentionto t^e large number of Cabinet Ministers absent from the division List.The Lord Privy Seal made an appeal to his colleagues to do their utmost to avoid the introduction of new legisla-tion, and said he had intended to make a special appeal tothe Minis ter^Tr^o^ Intro-it&apos;duct!on -of an Irish Transport Bill.It wasy&quot;&quot;agTreed^Hbcrcrever, that the passage of the licensing Bill was essential. . ....There was general agreement that, in - ord^jr^tr-madd^jaiithe Government majority in the Rouse of Commons, the attend-ance of Ministers, as an example to Private Members, was important, and that arrangements-should be made,, if any minister should require a holiday, for some other Ministerto undertake to be present regularly at the House of Oommonrduring his absence.The further consideration&apos;of the subject was adjourned until Monday next.-6-

It was painted out, however, that these ships would/be required in any event if our Wavy was not to fallcompletely behindhand, as the foreign ships for which theywere intended to compensate were already under construction and &quot;would certainly be completed irrespective of what might,-4^JLpeur at the Washington Conference.&quot;V- Cabinet agreed  That the Admiralty should have authority. to proceed with the construction of thefour capital ships provided for in thisear&apos;s Naval Programme:That the Prime Minister should reply to4hat effect to a Question to be addressedto him in Parliament on the following day.-7-

1/ ul&amp;tfj. SET,&quot;reAPPENDIX,PROPOSALS OP THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT POPI iAN IRISH SETTLEMENT,  20TH. JULY, 1921.The British Government are actuated by an. earnest desireto end the unhappy divisions between Great Britain andIreland which have produced so many conflicts in the past andwhich have once more shattered the peace and well-being ofIreland at the present time.   They long with His Majesty, theKings in the words of Eis Gracious Speech in Ireland last month,for a satisfactory solution o:  &quot;those age-long Irish . problems which for generations embarrassed our forefathers, as they nowweigh heavily upon us&quot;; and they.wish to do their utmost tosecure that &quot;every man of Irish birth, whatever be his creedand wherever bo his home, should work in loyal co-operationwith the free communities on which the British Empire isbased&quot;,   They are convinced that the Irish people may findas worthy and as complete an expression of their politicaland spiritual ideals within the Empire as any of the numerousand varied nations united in allegiance to His Majesty1 sThrone; and they desire such a consummation, not    only forthe welfare of Great Britain, Ireland and the Empire as awhole, but also for the cause of peace and harmony through-out the world.   There is no part of the world where Irishmenhave made their home   but suffers from our ancient feuds;no part of it but looks to this meeting betwesn the BritishGovernment and the Irish leaders to resolve these feuds ina new understanding honourable and satisfactory to all thopeoples involved.The free nations which compose, the British Empire are drawn from many races, with different histories, traditionsand ideals.    In the Dominion of Canada, British and french have long forgotten the bitter conflicts which divided theirancestors *    In South Africa the Transvaal Republic and the orange Free at ate have Joined with two British colonies tomaize.....
^jiiafc^ .a-greats His Majesty :s isway.The British people cannot believe tha&amp; where Canada ana SouthAfrica, with equal or even greater diffioulties,have so signallysucceeded,Ireland will fail; and they are determined that, sofar as they themselves can soeuro its nothing shall hinder Irishstatesmen from joining together to &quot;build up an Irish state infree and willing^co-operation-with the other peoples of theEmpire *Moved by theco considerations, the British Govs?iT3nent inviteIreland to take her placo in the great association of free nationsover whioh His Majesty reigns.   As earnest of their desire toobliterate old quarrels and to enable Ireland to face the futurewith her own strength and hope, they propose that Ireland shallas eon e forthwith the status of a Dominion with all the powersand   privileges set forth in this documento   By the adoptionof Dominion status it is understood that Ireland shall enjoycomplete autcmony In taxation and finance; that she shall maintainher own Courts of Law end Judges; that she shall maintain her cwnmilitary foroes for Home Defence, her own Constabulary and her ownPolice; that she shall take over the Irish postal services and all matters relating thereto, education, land, agriculture, mines andminerals, forestry, housing, labour, unemployment, transport, trade,healthpublic health,/insurance and the liquor traffic; and, in sum that sheshall exercise all those powers and privileges upon which theautonomy of the self-governing Dominions is based, subject onlyto the considerations set out in the ensuing paragraphs.   Guaranteedin these liberties, which no foreign. people can challenge withoutchallenging the ifcapire as   a whole.the.....
ifthe Dominions hold each and severally by virtue of theirBritish fellowship a standing .amongst the nations equivalent...not merely to their - individual strength, hut to the combinedpovrer and influence of all; the nations of the Commonwealth.      Thatguarantee, that fellowship,&apos;that freedom- the whole Empire looks toIreland to accept&quot;To-this&apos; settlement the British Government&apos;are prepared togive immediate effect&apos; upon the following conditions which are, Intheir opinion, vital to the welfare and safety of both GreatBritain and Ireland forming - as they do the heart of theC commonwealth:-1.    The Common concern of Great Britain, and Ireland in the:  defence of their interests by land and sea shall beitiutualiy recognised.       Great Britain lives by sea-bornefood;   her.communications depend upon the freedom of thegreat sea routes. Ireland lies at Britain&apos;s sideacross the seaways north and south that link her withthe sister nations of the Empire, the markets of theworld and the vital sources of her food supply.       in recognition of this fact, which nature has imposed andno statesmanship can change, it is essential that theRoyal -Navy alone should control the seas around Irelandand Great Britain, and that such rights and libertiesshould he accorded to it by the Irish State as are essential for naval purposes in the Irish harbours and onthe Irish coasts.&apos;11. In order that the movement towards the limitation ofarmaments which Is now making progress in the worldshould in no way bae hampered, it &quot;is stipulated that theIrish Territorial Force shall within reasonable limitsconform in respect of numbers to the militaryestablishments of the other parts of these Islands.
The position of Ireland-is also of great import-ance for the air services both military and civileThe Royal Air Force will need facilities for all purposes that it serves; and Ireland will form anessential link, in the development of air routes betweenthe British Isles and the North American Continent.It is therefore .stipulated that Grea$ Britain shall have all necessary facilities for the development of defenseand of ccfflEiumi eat ions by air.Great Britain hopes that Ireland, will in.due-course and of her own free will contribute In proportion to her wealth to the Regular Naval, Military and AirForces of the Empire *   It is further assumed that volutetary recruitment for these forces will be permittedthroughout Ireland, particularly for those famous Irish&quot;Regiments which have so lenj? and so gallantly served H.iaMajesty in all parts of the worldsWhile tho. Irish people shall enjoy completeautonomy in taxation and finance, it is essential toprevent a&apos;recurrence of ancient differences botw-senthe two -islands, and in particular to avert the p^ssi-*bility of ruinous trade wars.   With this object in uiew,the British and Irish Governments shall agree to imposeno protective duties .,or other restrictions /upon the flow of transport, trade and commerce between alj.parts of these islands.m     Tho Irish people shall agree to assume rospohsi^bility for a share of the present debt uf tho UnitedKingdom and of the liability for pensions arising outof the-&quot;Great War, the share, in frerfault of agreementbetween the Governments- concerned,, to be determinedby an independent arbitrator appointed from wit^i^-nHis Majesty5 s Dominions,,
4 f&apos; oIn accordance with these principles, the BritishGovernment propose that the conditions of settlement between Great Britain and Ireland shall.he embodied In theform of a Treaty, to which effoet shall in. due course be given by the British and Irish Parliamentsa   They look tosuch an Instrument to obliterate old conflicts forthwith,to clear the way for a detailed settlement in fullaccordance with Irish conditions and needs, and thfts toestablish a new and happier relation between Irishpatriotism and that wider community of aims and interests by which the unity of the whole Empire is freelysustained^The form in which the settlement is to take effect\will depend upon Ireland- h-ors-elf v   It must allow for full recognition of the existing powers and privileges of the parliament and Government of Northern Ireland, which cannotbe^ abrogated except by their own consent,   For their part,the British Government entertain an earnest hope that thenecessity of harmonious co-operation amongst Irishmen of allclasses and creeds will be recognised throughout Ireland,and they will welcome the day when by these means unityis achieved.   But no such common action can be secured by force.   Union came in Canada by the free consent of theProvinces,    So in Australia; so in South Afrioa0It will come in Ireland by no other way than consent.   -Therecso, in fact, be no settlement on terns involving, on thoone side or the other, that bitter appeal to bloodshedand violence which all men -o* good will are longing to terminate.   The British Government will undertake to giveeffect, so far as that depends on them, to any terms in thisrespect on which all Ireland unites,.-5-
tBut iii no conditions can they obnaent - to anybi*eposeJj -which would kia&amp;le civil *rttt* in Ireland.Such a war would not touch Ireland alone, for partisans?:ould flock to either side front Great Britain,, theEmpire,, and elsewhere with&apos; consequences more devastatingto the welfare both of Ireland and the Empire than, the conflict fce which a truce has been eel led this monthsThroughout the Empire there is a deep desire thatthe day of vieleuce should pass and that a solutionshould be found, consonant with the highest idealsand interests of all parts of Ireland, which will enable her to co-operate es a willing partn^ in the British Common^wealth.The British Government will therefore leave irish^men themselves to determine by negotiations between them whether the new powers, which the Pact defines shall be over by Ireland as a whole and administered by a singleIrish body, or taken ever separately by Southern andNorthern Ireland, with or without a joint authority toharmonise their common interests.   They will willinglyassist in the negotiation of such a settlement, if Irish-men should so desiree&apos; By these proposals the British Government sincerelybelieve that khey will have shattered the foundations ofthat ancient hatred and distrust which have disfiguredour common history for centuries past*.    The future ofIreland within the Commonwealth is for the Irish people to shape.In the foregoing proposals the British Governmenthave attempted no more than the broad: outline of a settle-ment.    The details they leave for discussion when the irish people have signified their acceptance of the principleof this pact.Downing Street, S.W.July 20th.,1921,

I 0U&apos;CE OF TIB     (1)     The Chancellor eiatfid that Jhe had received aJftaey FOBIWlD. strong protest from the Secretary for Scotland against the holding of a Conference of Ministers on the subject of housing at a time when he was engaged in the House OfCommons in connection with the Hallway Bill and thereforeunable to attend.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that he had arranged that the statement which had been prepared bythe Minister of Health for announcement in the House ofCommons would be shewn to the Secretary for scotland in draft.ioPOSED STATE-   ( )   The Conference met in accordance with Cabinet 3-B (SI)jjHT BY THEpiSTEE OF Conclusion 14, and had before them a draft which haabeen prepared by the-Minister of Health on the statement,which he proposed to make in the House of Commons (SeeAppendix).     The Conference agreed to the f oil owing; -(1) To approve the first paragraph of theDraft without alteration;(2) To insert the words &quot;for the time being at any rate&quot; after the first sentence inthe second paragraph.(3) To leave for further consideration thequestion whether the time for completion Ofwork by local Authorities should be extendedbeyond July 1923, as suggested in paragraph3 of the Draft\(4) To approve July 1st as the date by whichhouses will have to be begun in order to qualify for the subsidy, and to alter the wording of the draft to the following:-rand additional houses will be subsidised .only if begun before 1st July11.(5) To approve the insertion of the following words     in line 3 of paragraph 5 of theDraft after the word &quot;year&quot;; - &quot;includingthe absorption Of considerable- numbers ofox-service, men&quot;.(6 ) To
f6) To insert the word &quot;contemplated&quot;after the phrase &quot;larger clearanceschemes&quot; in line 4 of paragraph of the Draft.HOUSING (3)   During the consideration of the Draft Statement byPOLICY.the Minister of Health the change of policy decided on by the Government was the subject of discussion.    It was &apos;pointed out that the present Conference had been convened,not to consider questions of policy which had alreadybeen settled by previous minutes of the Cabinet tiift thefinance Committee, but to decide the exact form of thegeneral statement to be made by the Minister of Health.At the same time the Minister without portfolio stated.that he still desired to challenge the decision of the for the reasons set out inFinance Committee/ his Memorandum of July 4th(CP.3108) ConsidcrahL-discussion ensued as to the wisdom of the policy laiddown by the Finance&apos;Committee,    It was urged in supportof reconsideration of that policy that by the cancellation of contracts and by the abrupt termination of building^the Government would in effect be dishonouring its obligations.      It was true that the statement preparedby the Minister of Health expressly said that all expenditure in connection with Housing Schemes which hadbeen incurred by Local Authorities with the approvalof the Ministry of Health would rank: for financialassistance under the present scheme (which limited the liability of Local Authorities to the produce ofa Id, ;rate), but if this meant that the Government- would suspend all building operations at once and soleave derelict     sites on which houses were not actually being erected but which had been preparedby the laying of roads-and sewers, etc? the result &apos;Wb^Ldjbe

It should not he forgotten that since theArmistice the Government had exercised continual-pressure on local Authorities to support new schemes and float loans and generally concentrate their energiesoh large housebuilding operations.:by DrT.&apos; Addis on it was Urged/that it would be wrong now for theGovernment&apos; to suspend immediately all building operationsexcept-those for which it had incurred, a local obligationby reason of the approval of contracts.   The right policy was not to suspend the building operations permanently,but to delay those operations and spread them over a longer period of time, say three or four years.    This latter,policy would&apos;not have any different result from thatadvocated by the Minister of Health, at least during thenext&quot; year,  since the whole building trade would be fully occupied in completing schemes for which the government accepted responsibility.     The result of publicly witfa-drawing Government support to Housing Schemes in contemplation would be a complete cessation of housebuilding in this country since contractors could not-build to let at an economic rent.     Moreover, there wouldbe no confidence in any future pledge given by theGovernment if it were at any time decided to renew theGovernment&apos;s support to house building.     Politically,moreover, an abrupt suspension of Government support to house building would be disastrous.It was pointed out, on the other side, that theFinance Committee had decided and the Cabinet had approved the decision, that Government support should not begiven to the building of more thanl?6,000 houses..,-latitude was allowed, however, in cases where there wasa scheme which was not so far completed, but which could  ,be rounded off, and the Minister of Health had discretion(subject to the general limit of it 000 houses) to allow the

The estimated margin for this purpose was about12/OOOhouses.    Reference was made to the difficulty ofother than approved tendersfinding a universal test/by which it could be decided whether the Government wore committed to the erection ofhouses in any particular place and it was urged that under the proposal to Gpread out building operations forthree or four years the Government liability would beunascertainable and in any case very much greater than thatcontemplated by the Cabinet.      The Government would finditself in the morass of continuing comtni allotments.The Conference agreed:(1) That the concluding sentence of thesecond paragraph of the -Draft Statement. .should be altered to read as follows:-&quot;it is of/course olavioxxs that all ex-penditure in connection with theHousing Scheme which has a1 readybeen incurred by Local authorities with the approval of the Minister ofHealth will rank, etc&quot;(2) That at the end of paragraph 2 of the Draft .statement the following sentence should be&apos; inserted&quot;except with the prior consent of theMinister of Health no further assistance will be given by the State in respectof any houses for which        contractshavo not boen roade.&quot;
HOUSINGSUBSIDYSLUMAR3A8(4)     The Conference were Informed that this subsidyhad been In some measure misused for the erection of dwellings other than working class dwellings and thatsome reference might well be made to the fact in the minister of Health1s statement.It was pointed out, however., that no greatabuse could exist because of the restriction of thecubic capacity.of the houses to a maximum of 1,400 ft.The Conference agreed -That the Minister of Health should notin his statement refer to the allegedmisuse of the subsidy to private builders.(5) The Conference were informed that the annual contribution of   00,000 was necessary in view ofthe length of time which must- elapse between the floating of loans by Local Authorities to improveslum areas and the actual execution of work on thoseateas.     Unless the Government mo.de a contributionto the interest on the loans, Local Authorities wouldbe unwilling to operate.The Conference agreed - and the Chancellor ofthe Lxchequer concurred -That the Treasury should provide a maximumannual contribution of  200.000 towardsthe deficiency of capital charges on slumareas during the currency of loans raised enapproved schemes.CONCLUDING   (6) The Conference agreed -PARAGRAPHThat the announcement by the Ministerof Health should conclude with a brief statement of what had actually been effected under the housing schemessince the Armistice.OPANN 013 H C SivIEHTIt was stated that the announcement of the changeM2TH0D OP     (7)AHNOUHCEMENTin housing policy would be made in answer to a question in the House of Commons.

A 3? P E on.)In view of the very grnve financial difficultiesconfronting the nation and the Government at present andin the next financial year owing to the unparallelledand world-wide depression in trade and the unfortunateindustrial troubles which htvo so seriously affectedboth expenditure and revenue, the Government after themost careful consideration have come to the decision,with great regret, that the Housing programme must be subjected to a general review.The Government, thereforSi finds Itself compelled tecome to the decision of limiting the present expenditureon housing schemes.   With this object it has been decidedto limit the number of houses to be constructed by localauthorities and public utility societies under the present scheme to 176000.     This is the number of Jxouses for whichtenders have been approved.     It is, of course, obviousthat all expenditure in connection with the housingschemes which has been incurred by local authorities with the approval of the Ministry of Health will rank for financial assistance under tho present scheme, which limits the liability of local authorities to the produce of a penny rate.In cases where work undertaken by local authorities with the approval of the Ministry of Health oannot for reasons outside the control of the authorities be completed by July 1922, the time for completion will be extended bythe Ministry as may be necessary.As&apos; regards the scheme of Subsidy to private builders,the powers taken under the recent Act will be exercised tothe extent of making payment in full for houses completeswithir , c.
within the four months after the expiration of theprevious Act, i.e., by April 23rd last, and additional&apos;houses will be subsidised if begun before, the 1stJuly.     There will be cases in which commitments havebeen entered into, although the construction has not actually been begun, in anticipation of the continuanceof the Subsidy.      In order to meet these cases discretionwill be vested in.the Ministry of Health, to allowSubsidy to be paid and if building is started within one month of the present date, where commitments havebeen entered into before the present announcement of theGovernment policy.There is sufficient building in hand and in prospect to occupy the building industry for at least ayear and during that time it is the intentisn of theGovernment to re-examine the whole situation and to review the policy so as to bring it into closer relationto the financial capacity of the country.The Government recognise the urgent necessity ofmaking what improvements are possible under present financial circumstances in slum areas.    While itjmaynot be possible to carry out larger clearance schemes the Government are of opinion that much c*an be doneby measures of improvement and amelioration.    In srderto assist local authorities in such work they are preparedto provide an annual contribution not exceeding 200,000 towards the deficiency of capital charges -on slum areas.   This contribution will continue&apos;forthe whole term of the loans to be raised, by localauthorities to defray the necessary expenditure.    Bymeans of this contribution it is estimated that about 4,000,000 could be expended in the improvement&apos;-ofsuch areas.

ignhiT^M BY (1)   With reference to their discussion on the preceding&quot; VaDISOH.day, the Conference met to consider a memorandum &quot;by Dr.Addison (13/B/9 (1)  ) on Housing Policy, arid a draft of theannouncement to be made by the Minister of Health, revised in accordance with the decisions of the Conference (13/B/9).Ori Addison explained that the formula proposed &quot;by him was given in the first paragraph on page 2 of his memorandum,Ee had examinedj in consultation with the officials of theMinistry of Health, those Cases in which it could fairlyhe said the Government were committed.    The number of housesaffected was at least 35,000, the annual loss to the state in respect of these would depend on the course of prices for building - taking a figure of ;.i40 per house as against 60 the present figure of annual loss, the annual charge wouldbe  1,400,000.     The figures given in his memorandum were supplied by the Ministry of Health.The Conference were informed that the Prime minister had this morning approved the revised draft answerprepared by the   Inister of Health (13/B/9), andhad expressed the view that no alteration should be madein the number of houses allowed by the finance Committee.It was therefore impossible for the Conference to go beyond the Prime Ministers view and the decision both ofthe Pinanee Committee and the Cabinet.Dr. Addison stated that although his view disagreedwith that of the Pinanee Committee, he wished itto be put forward.     The particular point on which he saw difficulty was, what would be done with thoseundertakings which were in excess of the figure of176,000 houses, but to the carrying out of which theGovernment were, in his opinion, pledged ?     To dealwith this&apos;point he had drafted the following paragraphwhich should, in his opinion, be included in the Ministerof realties announcement :-
&quot; The ^Government recc^ni^ing the rftal need--&apos; for reduction of public expenditure in their reviewof departmental Estimates have given carefulconsideration to those relating to housing, and tothe difficulty which attaches J o adjusting asufficient effort to satisfy &quot;the vital need of thecommunity in this matter to. the equally vital need&quot;of economy.It appears that in most distridts, contracts for house building have been entered into., which..   will keep the industry fully employed for at least a year.       Further, in this time of falling pricesit is evident that great caution should be exercised in entering into additional commitaients, so that- whilst all obligations to which the Government mayfairly be regarded as committed with LocalAuthorities must be honoured, it is proposed thatthe work, save in special cases in connection withsuch. obligations^, should be spread over a longer period, and unless other arrangements can be made inthe meantime, it is proposed that an additional twoyears should be allowed for this work.       During&quot;Ghis time every effort will be made in concert with,those concerned, to limit the cost to the utmost possible extent, and to foster such&apos;conditions aswill encourage the resumption of house building by private enterprise,&quot;Objection was.raised to the terms of the aboveparagraph as it was not considered to give a sufficiently clear indication of the Government&apos;s policy in regard to future buildjng. Local Authorities, it was maintaine-r1wished to know definitely whether they should continuebuilding.       They did not wish to be left in suspensewith large staffs and plans for housing;operations.
They-did not care whether- -they huilij. Joouaes--or-not, hut&apos;if they were ultimately not -allowed to ^bu^ld houses * they&apos;.wished to he told-nowregards the word-^^mmxiiaB^^It was represented that the Government- were&apos;&quot; net -committe-j.to anything.     Local Authorities were.merely Government*        y , e&apos;r:--in effectagents.     The land they had bought helonged/io. the&apos;&quot; - . i&quot; t&apos;&quot;.^-!.    .&apos;-**Government, and the loss arising-from resale^w^uld fallon the Government. *     All -&quot;that Local Authorities were responsible- for was the penny rate.It was pointed out that the -question was principle&quot;?,-ally one of form and not of substance, since the decisionof the Finance Committee would take no practical effect until the middle of 1922.       It was therefore important &apos;that the proposed announcement should not indicate acomplete change of policy and give the impression that  *the Government were suddenly dropping the Housing policywhich they had so strongly supported up-till- now.     Itwas therefore urged that the form of the statement &quot;^shouldbe recast, and that a new Introduction should be draftedon the following lines:-(1)   A statement of the number of houses built andof the work effected under the Housing Schemes.(2)   A statement that at the present time houses under contract were sufficient, to afford work forall available labour and a considerable number of ex-service men for a period of at least one year.(3)   A statement that the Government had thereforeperformed at great cost, a work of national importance, which the private contractor was whollyunable to perform.
1/5(4)    A statement that prices were now falling, andpossibly before a year had elapsed the privatecontractor might be able to resume normal work.The Government had therefore decided that for thetime being, at any rate, expenditure must belimited.       The rest of the statement would thenfollow on the lines suggested by the Minister ofHealth. VIt was pointed out that to omit allreferences, to Pinancio^Sonsiderations would be to concealthe real reason for the change of policy.      This reasonwas well known to the public and to the local Authorities.The policy would never have been changed but for thedecision to reduce Estimates by twenty per cent.     The pro-for 1982-33Visional Estimates of the Ministry of Health/had allowed for an increase of  3,000,000 or  4,000,000 in tho housing expenditure o it would be insincere and politically impossible to pretend that the announcement was causedby anything other than financial stringency.      Moreover,if a particular Authority claimed that it desired, to erect additional houses and that it could provide thelabour and materials, there would be no adequateexplanation of a refusal of permission except on financial grounds.      It would be impossible to hide the true facts from important local Authorities.        It wasalso urged, that there was no breach of faith insuspending operations beyond, the 176,000 houses, sincethe loss fell on the Government, and compensation wouldbe paid&apos; for commitments entered into by LocalAuthorities with Government approval.      It would be a breach of faith to keep the Local Authorities insuspense., and instead of telling them to stop further operations at once, to advise them merely to proceedcautiously.
17SThe Conference agreed:-(l)   That the announcement to he nade by theMinister of Health should introduce in itspreamble the four points referred toica&apos;- page 3    above, of this minute.(2)    That the announcement should not give any indication of a possibility of government assistance being afforded towards thecompletion of the 35,000 houses&quot;to which,  in -the opinion of Dr, Addison, the Governmentwere committed over and above the 176,000authorised by the Finance Committee.(3)    That the announcement should not attempt to conceal the fact that the country could notface financially large schemes of.expenditure,and.that it was impossible to go on with any expenditure which could be avoided.(4)    That the Conference would reassemble at.30 pan. the same day in the room of theMinister of Health at the House of Commons,to consider the draft announcement after ithad been revised in accordance with theirpresent discussion,(2c)       Some discussion took place in regard to the final paragraph of Dr. Addison&apos;s Memorandum of July 12th(13/3/9 .(l)  ).      It was urged that theproposal to allocate  200,000 for the redemption of slumareas was entirely inadequate, and that a contribution should be made starting with  200,000 a year in tho first two years and rising to a maximum of  1.000,000 at the endof 10 years.The opinion of the Conference was that it would beimpossible to allocate more than  200,000 per annum forthis purpose at the present time.     It was,however,suggested that in the announcement to the House of commons the Minister cf Health should refer to the government contribution as being  4,000,000, which is the capitalisedvalue of an annual contribution of  200,000.     In favour
- 6 rof tliis view it was urged that a contribution of 4,000,000 would appear to be much more substantialthan one of  200*000 per annum and would thereforebe much more acceptable to labour.     On the otherhand the reference to a lai-ge sum such as  4,000,000would, it was thought, give rise to accusations ofwaste on the part of the Government,     It would,therefore, be preferable from a political point ofview to refer to this contribution towards slumclearances as a grant of  200*000 per annum, -The Conference agreed: **   -That in tha announcement to theHouse of Commons,-the Minister ofHealth .sh^uld- describe the contribution**bution towards slum clearances asan annual grant of  2^0,000and should make no reference to-iUie&quot;capitalised&apos;value of this sum.2 Whitehall .Gar dens, S.w),l.13th July, 1921.

APPENDIX.CABINET.&quot;Housing Policy. .3135 a      AMENDED DRAFT STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER. OF HEALTH.(As agreed at Conference of Ministers heldJuly 13th 1921 at 5,30 p.m.)The number of houses built, building, and contained in approvedaders under the housing scheme for local authorities and public utilitypieties Is now about 176,000.     Under the scheme of subsidy to privatelders the number of houses built or to be built is estimated at rtout,00Oe    The annual cost to the State under the local authorities andjblic utility societies schemes is ftout    10,000,000 per annum and thebunt required for payment of subsidies to private builders is about000,000.In view of the immense difficulties confronting the nation during a after the war the Government think that they have no reason to bessatisfied with the scale cf their contribution to the housing prob-ra- a contribution, notwithstanding the grave embarrassments of the warthout precedent in our history.    The Government is under f-ts housingtiemes performing at great cost a work of supreme national importanceich private enterprise could not carry out.   At the present time theuses which are being built or are to be built under the Governmentluaing scheme will utilise all available labotir for at least twelvemths including a considerable number of ex-service men to be absorbedthe Industry *   By the end of twelve months conditions may haveanged very greatly, prices may be stabilised and the considerationson which Government action should be based may be fundamentally*ered.   Reconsideration is moreover imperative when regard is paid the present financial condition of the country.   Very grave finan-*1 difficulties will confront the nation for the remainder of theesent and throughout the next financial year owing to the unparalleled$ world-wide depression in trade; and the unfortunate IndustrialRubles which have so seriously affected both expenditure and revenue,
toeing at any rate^ the following .lJLm.la^a^i.o?a^/trus.t..be placed on housing expenditure..    The naracer - of houses trO^h^-Kxmiitruckedby local authorities and public utility societies with government assistance under the present scheme will be limited to 175,000,that being the number built, building, or for which tenders havebeen approved, and assistance will not be given under the scheme in respect of any houses in excess of that number.    It wouldappear that on a final examination of the present approved tenderssome adjustments will be possible to meet -cases of hardship with-out exceeding this totalsAll expenditure in connection with the housing schemes whichhas already been incurred toy locals authorities with the approvalOf the Ministry of Health will rank for financial assistance underthe present scheme^ which limits the liability of local authoritiesto the produce of a penny rate,., and where work undertaken by localauthorities with the approval of the Ministry of Healtht cannot for reasons outside the control of the authorities be completed by july 1922, the time for completion will he extended   by theMinistry as may toe necessary.As regards the scheme of subsidy to private touilders, thepowers taken under the recent Act will be e xercised to the e xtentof making payment in full for houses completed within the four months after the expiration of the previous Act, i.e., by April23rd last, and additional houses will be subsidised only if begunbefore the 1st July under a certificate or the promise by a localauthority of a certificate.     There will be cases in whichcommitments have been entered into, although construction has not actually been begun, in anticipation of the continuance of thesubsidy.    In order to meet these cases I shall, In the exerciseof my di scretion, pay subsidy where commitments have beer, enteredInto if workkis started within six weeks of the present date.
2, Whitehall Gardens. S.WJuly 14th. 1921.0   The Government recognise the urgent necessity of making whatImprovements ftrs possible under present financial circumstances in slum areas.     To this end they are prepared to provide anannual contribution not exceeding  200,000 towards the deficiencyon local authorities1 accounts for the improvement of slum areas.This annual contribution will contimxe for the whole term ofsuch loans as may have to be raised by local authorities to defraythe necessary expenditure.It is the intention of the Government to keep the housing,problem closely under review.    They fully recognise the importanceof that problem from the point of view of the health and social conditions of the people but it is Impossible to incur greatercommitments than our finances will allow.
