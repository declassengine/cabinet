^HF IMPERIALMPETI01S.(1) The Lord Privy Seal, on &quot;behalf of the Prime Minister,Informed his colleagues that at the first of the forthcomingpresentation. Imperial Meetings the Prime Minister proposed that theBritish Government should be represented &quot;by the followingMinistersThe Lord Privy Seal^The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for India would be present asa representative of India,Other Ministers would be invited to attend meetingsaccording to  the nature of the business.the Cabinet postponed the discussion of the following ques-tions which had appeared on the Agenda Paper:-REPORT OF IMPERIAL SHCTINiJ COMMITTEE,INTT5R*-ALLIED COLONIAL EXHIBITION.British Re-QJJESTIONSPOSTPONED.
OT^I^lE&quot; (SJ^heKlBboj a Note by the Secretary,D^velopmeM^^o^rlng a Conclusion of the Stand3^j3etfenoe Sub-Committeeof, as a naval Base.     of the Committee of Imperial Defence, on the question of thedevelopment of Singapore as a naval base (Paper cp.-S0S9),together with a detailed Memorandum by the Oversea DefenceCommittee on the same subject (C.XcDo Paper No.143-0).The Lord President of the Council (Mr Balfour), as chairman of the Standing Defence Subcommittee, explained tothe Cabinet the reasons which had led up to his Sub-Committeearriving at the Conclusion which was under consideration(See. y4nutej^ f,^&amp; M^ .6t   \te $fUmJf  $2t&amp;P&amp;BBCommjtteeJ .   Mr Balfour outlined broadly how the naval situa-tion had changed, and bow the renewal of the Anglo-japanese alliance, although reducing&apos;the probability of danger arising in the Pacific in the immediate future, would net remove theneed for developing a naval ba3e at Singapore, which, standingas it did at the entrance to the Pacific, not only covered the main entrance to the Indian Ocean from the eastward butflanked the route from Eastern Asia to Australasia, and was of very great importance to the Dominions.    He further pointedout that, now that oil fuel had been introduced into the royal navy, although the fleet might get to Singapore, it would behelpless when it arrived there if it did not find at least theImportant elements of a naval base.   He also called attentionto the fact that, even if the work of developing the port werebegun now, it would probably not be completed before the expix*-ation of the next term of renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alli-ance, say, four to five years.   Mr Balfour added that it was because the interests of the British Empire In the Pacificwer* so Immense that the Standing Defence Sub-Committee had,after a long discussion, arrived at the Conclusion which was before the Cabinet,    as, whatever fleet we might maintain, itwas almost impossible to continue a situation which meant thatwe could not use it in those waters where it was most likelyto be required.
During -the dieo^^ia^^ it w3a pointedout that the de-velo^ent of Singapore as a naval ba3e wouldIncldeni^lly&apos;: protect the West Coast of Canada from attack by Japan, insofar that, so long as the British fleet couldbe concentrated and use the port as a repair and supply base,Japan could not afford to send her fleet to the Western Coasto-f Canada,The great importance of being in a position to tell the Dominion Governments that we had a Naval Policy was alsostrongly emphasized,, attention being called to the fact thatthe United States were oontl^TtiaitSy^suggeoting that theAmerioan-Narry jwus -avtidJLable for the protection of clvilisa-.tion and the white races of the world.    But the main point was that we must be in a position to say that we had a prac--tical plan.   This was even more important than actuallycommencing the work of developing Singapore at the moment.The Cabinet were also informed that the OverseaDefence Committee had been instructed to prepare in detaila programme of expenditure to be spiroad over a series ofyears, and that tho necessity for this expenditure would besubject to careful investigation,noOn the understanding tirac/considerable expenditureneed be, expected for the next two years, the Cabinet agreed--To approve the following conclusion-of theStanding Defence Sul^-Oommittee of the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence, for submission to the foxddicoming Meeting of Prime Minis-ters and Representatives of India:-&quot;The Committee recognise that the questionof incurring expenditure under existing conditions on the development of singapore as a naval base is one v/hich involves pol-political and financial considerations outside their purview:    and that accordingly a finaldecision in the matter must rest with theGabinet,In view, however, of the vital importance from a strategical and Imperial point ofview of developing the port of Singaporeon such lines as will make it possiblefor the British fleet to operate in the pacific, if called upon to do so, theCommittee are of opinion that at the
forthcoming meeting of Prime Ministers and representatives of India, the policy favour-ed by His Majesty&apos;s Government should be stated as follows:-(a) Hie Majesty&apos;s Government fully recognisethat the basis of any system of Imperialdefenoe against attack from oversea,whether upon the United Kingdom, Auatra-lasia or elsewhere, must be, as it hasalways been, the maintenance of our seapower:(b) The most pressing question in this con-nection at the present time is that ofthe measures to be taken for the pro-tec tion of Imperial interests in thePacifie:(c) His Majesty&apos;s Government are advised thatfor this purpose it is essential thatSingapore should be available as a base of concentration, repair, and supply for the British fleet and auxiliary services;   and they are accordinglyprepared to take the lead in develop-ing that port as a naval base:(d) Owing to existing financial conditions it will not he practicable to incur alarge expenditure for this pxirpose inthe immediate future;   but it is theintention of His Majesty&apos;s&apos;Governmentto develop the base as funds become available, and the greater the assist-ance that can he rendered, by the OverseaGovernments in this connection the soonerwill the necessary programme be completed&quot;
STATB-AXDEDEMPIfSF S^T-ADEN.*4-&quot;I(4) With reference to Cabinet 66 (20), Conclusion 4, theGabinet, had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, covering a letter from Lieut,-ColonelI..S, Amery, together with a summary of the results of aConference between representatives of certain of the Doruln-ions and of the Colonial Office on the subject of State-aidedEmpire settlement (Paper CP.-2243).The Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty (Lt,-Col.Amery), who, as former Under-Secretary for the Colonies, wasclosely concerned in this matter, gave the Cabinet an explain-nation of the proposals of the Conference.,In the course of th^ discussion, stress was laid onthe great importance, on the- broadest Imperial grounds, of continuing to send a stream of settlers from the mother country to the Dominions,   The War had provided the beste^a^-ple of the high returns obtainable from such a policy.The importance was also emphasized of overseas settlementfrom the point of view of unemployment, not only in its immediate results but also owing to the increasing difficultyof providing continuous and regular employment within theBritish Isles for the whole population of this country.On the understanding that caotion should be exercised in regard to any immediate expenditure, and that there shouldbe no Supplementary Estimate or fresh Vote during the present financial year, the Secretary of State for the Colonies was authorised to enter into negotiations with the Prime ministers of the Dominions on the lines of the proposals of the Confer-ences which are s^t -forth in Paper CP.-2943,(5) In tha course       tlv preceding discussion, the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies reported to the Cabinet that a message, accompanied by gifts, had been received from theArab Chieffman, who had for the last year or two caused agood deal of trouble in the Aden region.    He was not withouthope that this approach might lead to more friendly relations and a consequent reduction of expenditure on the garrison of aden.
 l/?^00^ With ref^ne9 to Cabinet 47 (21), Conclusion 1, thepKSs ACT. *&amp;ir5iiSter-*o^^^ the-- cabinet of the present position of the negotiations with the agricxil-tural interests In regard to the repeal of Part I of the agriculture Act.   Meetings had been held with the national farmers&apos; Union j at which-an offer1 had been made to them bi4 a cash payment of  2 per acre4 which would Cost the State about 11,000,000.    They had asked for  5 per acre, which would havecost nearly  ^5yXXX)r000.    It had been pointed out to thorn that negotiations on such a basis would n.*)t succeed, and afv.er a prolonged discussion they had agreed to recommend their mem-bers to accept, if offered, payment at the rate of  4 per acrefor oats and  5 per acre for wheat.    On this basis the costto the State would be in the neighbourhood of  19,000^000 or 2 0^000,000.In the course of the discussion, reference was made tothe great importance of securing, before the Second Reading ofthe amended Bill, the assent of the farmers to the formationof local Wage Conciliation Boards m place of the existing machinery.A suggestion was made that, in defence of the Govern-menfs policy, reference should be made to the gain which would,accrue to the public from falling food prices as a set-off tothe cost of the Government subsidy.It was explained that the Secretary for Scotland was.&apos; unable to be present at the Cabinet as he was meeting adeputation of Scottish agriculturists.The Cabinet took note of the statement by the Minister of Agriculture and Fish-eries, and the Chancellor of the Rxchequerundertook to prepare a&apos; Memorandum dealingwith the compensate ry advantages of cheapfood over the cost of the subsidy to the farmers.* *  *  *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 16, 1921.
