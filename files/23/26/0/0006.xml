In the course of this discussionM, Briand had absolutely declined to consider the snbstjtu-tion of a Civil Commissioner for General le Pond, on theground that it would be regarded in Prence as a humiliatingsur^psnder4 &amp;,nu had indicated his willingness to send 30,COOadditional troops to Upper Silesia.The result of the conversation had. been the despatchof an identic telegram to the British, French and Italianrepresentatives on the Upper Silesia Commission, asking thefollowing questions  (Telegram from Lord Cturzon, Paris, No. 390,dated June 20, 1921):-&quot;(a) Does the Commission consider that, under present conditions, and if given more time than was the case, when ashed for its first report, it could agree on a single jointproposal regarding the frontier to be drawn between Poland and Germany?    If the answer is in the affirmative, how soon could thi3report be brought up and submitted to thePowers?(b) If the. Commission does not think itself ina position to arrive at. a joint proposal,do^-s it consider that the addition of technical Advisers  (jurists and engineers),to be chosen by Governments and sr-.nt toUpper Silesia, would help it in its task and enable it to reach a joint solution?&quot;It was understood that in the event of negative replies being received, the matter would have to be settled by the supreme council, ard M. Briand had agreed to a meeting being heldafter July 10th    the date of the rising of the French Parlia-ment.i
ABROGATIONOF RH IN ELANDSANCTIONS.(3) With reference to Cabinet 56 (21), Conclusion 1(a)(3), the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that at the close of the conversations withM. Briand he had drawn attention to the desirabilityof abolishing the Rhineland Sanctions0     M. Briand had replied that such action must depend on the progress made by Germany in carrying out the disarmamentconditions.     He (Lord Curzon) had thereupon intimated thatthe matter would be raised at the next Meeting of theSupreme Council.CABINETTHANKS TOTHE SEC RE-TARY OFSTATE FORFOREIGNAFFAIRS.(4) The Prime Minister, with the unanimousapprobation of his colleagues^ expressed the thanksand congratulations of the Cabinet to the Secretary ofState fcr Foreign Affairs upon a successful mission to Paris which had not only achieved substantial and satisfactory results but had dons much to defineand improve the relations between the two countries..statements in PARLIA-M3NT on lord CUR-ZON&apos;visit to paris.(5) The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to furnish the Prime Minister with notes toserve as the basis for as f-iSll a statement a3 possibleconsistent with the public Interest, in both houses of Parliament, of the results of Lord CurzorJsconversations in Paris.
AI.LFOFP (6) The attention of the Cabinet was invited to tele gransOVERTURESpnOM MUSTAPHA from General Sir John Harington to the war Office, No.454,KEYiAL.dated June 20, 1921, and from Mr Rattigan, at Constantinople,No. 443, dated Jane 20, 1921, reporting the receipt of a message from Mustapha Kemal, communicated through Major Henryindicating a desire to meet General Harington.Xn the course of the discussion a suggestion was strongly pressed that, with a view to countering the influencof the Bolsheviks at Angora and to preparing a favourable at-mosphere at Angora for later negotiations, advantage shouldbe taken of this overture to enter into relations with Musta-pha Kemal.    Stress was laid on the importance of this g&amp;esti&apos;^from the point of view of the negotiations on the verge of completion at Kabul with the Amir of Afghanistan.    It waspointed out that, at the moment when the Allies were awaiting the reply of the Greek Government to their offer of mediationit might be premature to enter into any communication with mustapha Kemal, anS^that^^^1 the French and italian governments would have to be informed In advance should we decide to proceed in the matter. - rThe Cabinet agreed  -To adjourn the discussion until the meetingof the Cabinet on the following day at 6 p.m.&apos;r&apos; - 2, Whit ehall Gardens, S. W. 1,June 21, 1921./
APPENDIX.stji^iahy^of-^^        by LOBD-cusaoir on. his visit TO rAiaS,     JUNE 18th - 19th 19SImm mm --* -* ******* ** mmmm *MM ****** WMtJLord Curzon stated that, accompanied by Lord Hardinge andSir Horace Basabold, he had spent two days at the French ForeignOffice holding conversations with !i.Briand and ILBerthelot.The first day had teen devoted to the Eastern question and thesecond to Bpper Silesia and to some other minor questions.     on each occasion the Italian Ambassador had been brought in to beinformed of the conclusions reached and had been asked to inviteby telegram the assent of his Government to them.     The conversat-ions were Informal and.friendly in character and his visit appearedto give very great satisfaction to the French Government.He had begun by explaining the situation in tho East as weunderstood it.    The position had become worse in regard to ourrelations with the Turks who had failed to deliver the british prisoners;  in regard to the French whose agreement with MustaphaLemal had broken down; and in regard to the Italians whose agree-ment had also broken down and who had withdrawn from ^.dalia.Further, the relations of the Bolsheviks and the hemalists had become MJloser.      It was in these circumstancos that the ling of greece had gone to Smyrna where he might shew himself to thetroops and proceed to the front at their head,  or he might soonterminate his visit and return to Athens.     He had furnishedM.Briand with the information in our possession as to the conditionof the Greek forces which we had derived from General Harington-anflCoLliairne.     The information of the French Government was that thematerial condition of the Greek arms had improved but there vmsmuch lassitude and no local elan and they would probably seek an excuse for not fighting.       He had laid it down that we shouldnot put pressure on them not to fight if they were themselvesdetermined to fight and he had indicated that in his view a Greeksuccess in the near future could hardly be maintained permanently.
6 0A Turkish, success -would have disastrous consequences far beyondGreece *     The moment was therefore a suitable one for negotiation,,Proceeding to the discussion of terms, he had put forward the conclusions reached by the Cabinet Committee at Chequerson 9th June*SMYRNA.He had indicated our xvillingness to make Smyrna an autonomousprovince - on the analogy of Lebanon - under a Christian Governorwith a gendarmerie officered by Europeans, the province to be under Turkish suzerainty and the Greek Garrison not to be withdrawnuntil the new authority had been set upu     He had also called attention to the large number of Greek refugees in Smyrna.     MrBriandhad accepted our proposed solution and had referred to the analogy of Macedonia as an e xaraple of the successful institution of aninternational gendarmerie.THRACE.Having been told that M. Briand was likely to press for thesubstitution of the Enos-Media line for the Chatalja line, whishwould seriously modify the Treaty of Sevres, he (Lord Curzon) haddefended the Chatalja line and indicated the modifications of theLondon terms embodied in Mr, Montagu&apos;s letter of April 29th to theIndian Mohammedan delegates, and in particular the special arrange-ments In which we should Insist for the administration ofAdrianople and for the guarantee of Moslem rights in Thrace.To meet M. Briand&apos;s objection that the Greeks were almost in thesuburbs of Constantinople he had proposed the adoption of ademilitarised zone which might cover a considerable strip of territory extending possibly even so far as the Enos-Media line,but this did not satisfy .1. Briand who pressed for the creationof an autonomous state in Thrace as in Smyrna.Lord Curzon had resisted this, hot only as tearing up theTreaty, but as likely to make mediation with the Greeks impossible.
p -t01M. Briand had than suggested going back to the London positionand having a Commission of Enquiry, hut it was pointed out thatthis had already been declined by the Greeks and that if negotia-tions took place and the Greeks entrusted their case to theAllies the question of the future of Thrace could be raised by theTurks.      What was desirable now was to make clear the terraswhich would be sent to the Greekso     Assuming the Allies were agreed as to Smyrna and would not advance on tho position taken up with regard to Thrace, it might be possible to reconsider thoalready relaxed financial conditions laid down in London in theterms offered to Bekir Saral Bey.     Mo Briand said- that the FrenchGovernment was specially interested in this,, but after discussionadded that he did not wish to be unaccommodating in this matter,,Lord Curzon had then hinted at the possibility of providing an outlet for a resuscitated Turkey on its Eastern boundaries, butto this Me Briand had prof essed indifference and vrould do no morethan express a willingness to give a joint support to a renovatedTurkey.TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT.The discussion had then turned upon the Tripartite agreement which the Turks very much rosent in as much as it affects theirsovereignty,     M. Briand agreed that the arrangement had been abad one but feared great difficulties with the Italians in can-celling it.      Ultimately it was agreed that the Tripartite Agree-ment - if the Italians consent - in its present form is to dis-appear and that in its place the French and Italian governments should be left free to make such friendly arrangements as to continue concessions with the new Turkish Government as theywere able to secure; each of the Allied Governments entering intoa friendly understanding not to compete, In the areas originallyspecified, with the others.      This decision marked an importantadvance on the attitude hitherto taken up with
with regard to the Tripartite Agreement by the French and italians, but they were reminded that if the Agreement disappearedthey would not be absolved from their obligations to minorities.,The Italian Ambassador, when consulted about this point had shownconsiderable consternation but had promised to refer it to RcmeeHe had then turned to discuss the inducements to Greece toplace herself in our hands.      In the event of the Turks decliningto enter into negotiations or cf the negotiations breaking down the Allies would remove the existing embargo on the purchase ofmunitions of war in their respective countries.      (In reply to enquiries Mo Berthelot had declared that while no doubt negotiations had been proceeding between the Greeks and the armament firms theFrench Government had preserved scrupulous neutrality and no armsor equipment had in fact been delivered).      In the second place the Allies might be able to remove some of the financial restrictionsplaced on the Greeks and in the third place they might be able to-blockade the approaches to the Black Sea and Adalia.     To all thisMb. Briand had replied - &quot;Let there be no threats, let us havepersuasion.&quot;It had then been agreed that an identic telegram should besent to the representatives of the three Governments at Athensinviting the Greeks In the interests of peace and in their own interests to place their fortunes in the hands of the Allies.(At this stage Lord Curzon read Telegram 389 D. of June 20th, 1921,despatched from Paris to Athens).     In the opinion of the FrenchGovernment the Greeks will accept the Invitatioiio      In the event oftheir so doing, he (Lord Curzon) will then prepare a secondtelegram containing the &quot;Chequers terms&quot;.     This the French maywant to modify in some particulars-     There remained thequestion of how to approach the Turks and ho had laid great stress on the importance of taking identic and simultaneousaction at Constantinople and at Angora when the time came.
He had drawn attention to the rumours that representatives  of French and Italian Governments were proceeding on secret missions to Angora but had been assured that the visitors referred to were quite unauthorised and that the Italian had teen stopped at Rhodes. At this stage he raised the question of the command of the Allied troops at Constantinople and the necessity for terminating the long drawn out squabble which had taken place. In the end M. Briand gave way and agreed to the appointment of General Harington on condition that the fact was not advertised. Asked what would be his attitude if in his reply King Constantine interpreted the approach of the Allies as a recognition of his Government, ? Briand said that under no circumstances whatever would he be prepared to recognise King Constantine. He (Lord Curzon) had also sounded L. Briand on the French idea of the future government of Constantinople and had gathered that M. Briand&apos;s view was that the ultimate solution was a single government at Constantinople and the object of the Allies should be to tempt the Kemalists to come down to Constantinople by stages and there set up a moderate Nationalist Government under the Sultan.

 after some discussion at this point by the Cabinet of General Harington&apos;s telegrams to the War Office on a proposed meeting with Mustapha Kemal, Lord Curzon, and continued his statement, and referred to the presence of Bekir Sami Bey at Rome as an unofficial intermediary of the Kemalists. He was proceeding to Paris and to London. According to the information of the French the Bolshevik, or extreme party is in power for the moment at Angora and Bekir Sami Bey is visiting Europe it is believed, on behalf of the more moderate elements.
The d i sous s ion with M* Briand of the problem of UpperSilesia had fallen into two parts:  (1) the local situationand (2) future policy*      Lord curzon stated that he had describedso far as he was able, the present situationhow we sent cut six Battalions and had replaced Colonel Percivalby Sir Harold Stuart, under whose direction the situation was improving.     When Sir Harold Stuart arrived the Polish insurgentsand the German self-protection forces were in contacte     The insur-gents were ravaging the district and the Germans wore only with difficulty restrained from attacking them.      The first suggestion of the Commission had been to set up a neutral acne, but it was difficult to find ensugh troops to occupy it.     There had then been suggested a progressive and reciprocal withdrawal of thetrcops on each side, and (according to a telegram just received)this was new being carried cut.      Cne of the difficulties of thediscussion had been the undisguised sympathy of the FrenchGovernment with the Poles, and. their endeavour to represent theGermans as being on precisely the same footing as the insurgents,and deserving of identical treatment.     When the difficulty aboutthe neutral zone had been mentioned, M. Briand. had said thathe was prepared to send 30,000 troops to occupy the zone.Lord Curzon had suggested that the Military Commission wasunsuited to the task which had devolved upon it, and ought to bereplaced by a Civil Commission, but M. Briand would not hear Ofthis suggestion.      To remove General Le Rond, he contended, wouldbe most humiliating to French pride.     As it was no use pursuing thissuggestion it had been agreed to vindicate the authority of theexisting Commission, and to give it another chance of reaching a unanimous report, with or without the help of independenttechnicians.     A telegram in this sense had been sent to Oppeln.It was now up to the Commission to say what solution they desired.,In the event of unfavourable replies being received from them the question would have to be settled by the Supreme Council,
Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 21, 1921.and      VII&amp;anrfTpsA; agreed to a meeting of the Council being held, provided it was not- summoned before July 10th,  thedate of the adjournment of the French...Par 11 ament,Lord Curzon had then intimated that at the meeting of theSr.prerr* Council not only might it be ne-ceseary to discussthe problem of Upper Silesia, hut it would be necessary todiscuss the cancellation of the Rhineland sanctions, thegrourd. for the imposition of which had now disappeared orhad been h, rgely modified.    M. Briand retorted that theFrench Government took a very firm line on the question of the^de sanctions, and would not agree to their removal until they were satisfied that the disarmament conditions agreed tcin London had been carried out by the Germans,

67 S(1)  The Primer mnis*betf th&amp;nke^hia -eoOhaagiies for their consideration in coming to &quot;Chequers&quot; to attend this meeting.He himself would certainly have returned to London had thisnot been rigorously interdicted by his medical adviser.mTbvSSlos.        (2)   &apos;;ith reference t0 0-F-C Minutes, Conclusion 3,... the Committee were informed that M. Venizelos had arrived inLondon early in the week and had been the Prime Minister, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chief of theImperial General Staff.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated thathe had explained to M. Venizelos the circumstances in whichhis opinion was invited.    After recalling the sequence ofevents which had led up to-the present position, Lord Curzonhad expressed the gratitude due to Greece for the services&apos;she had rendered to the Powers,and the consequent    reluctancethat was felt... in suggesting any sacrifice of Greek claims whirhhad previously been admitted.    He had pointed out, however,the dangers of the present military situation, which might result not enly :&apos;i&quot;n the loss to &apos;Greece of the Smyrna area, but of the withdrawal of the Allies  from Constantinople and the subsequent recapture by the Turks of Thrace.    In these circumstances-stances the british  Government had thought it would be valuableto know M. Venizelos&apos; s views,  the more so as the views of theGreek Government were not^ in present Circumstances, easy toascertain.    In particular, he had asked M. Venizelos whether&apos;,if he himself had been in office at Athens, he would have regarded an approach by the Allies with a view to some media-tien involving a sacrifice of Greek claims as an act oftreachery.    M. Veniselos had replied that he was not in close touch with the situation, and did not pretend to know the viewof the Government at Athens,    He had said,  however, that hecould see nothing incompatible with the dignity of Greece inany approach which the Allies might sake to the Greek Govern-ment with a view to a cessation of hostilities &quot;and a negptia-tion with the Turks.    If he had been in the place of tte
eocixrtTtr^-^reek,., *km^i*pn&amp;: Twmroid, n^rbOia-ve z^a^ertt^eu -such,-a n.overture.    The Allies would, of course, have to safeguardthemselves against the vc-s-s-lhhlity of an accusation thatthey had given away the Greek people,    He had urged that,if they intended to act at all, the Allies should act prompt-ly:-, but., he had expressed the view that, in the present temperof Mustapha Kemal and the-Angora Government, they were not likely to succeed.    In reply to a cuestion by Lord Curzon asto whether,   in the event of a favourable reply by the GreekGovernment, the Powers should approach Mustapha Kemal, orwhether it would not be better to approach the ConstantinopleGovernment, with a view to detaching the moderate Turks fromthe Angora extremists,  m. Venizelos had expressed the opinionthat it would be best to deal with both, as had been done atthe London Conference.M, Venizelos had further givan   his opinion that, if the pio-posed negotiation was unsuccessful, the Greek Governmentcould not maintain their position in Asia Minor for more than six months without Allied support, but Lord Curzon had im-pressed on him the extreme unpopularity both in Great Britainand Prance of any new war with Turkey.In his interview with the Prime Minister, the CommitteeVwere informed, m. Venizelos had insisted and reiterated that,in the evert of Mustapha Kemal refusing to negotiate on thebasis proposed, the only alternative to the Allies of active -support to Greece was a humiliating surrender to Mustapha-Kemal, involving not only their being driven out of Constan-tinople but eventually also from Mesopotamia, Syria and Pales-tine.    The more the Prime Minister had dwelt on the Impossi-bility of the Allies embarking on a fresh war with Turkey,the more had M. Venizelos insisted on the fact that theGreek army was the only barrier between them and  a humiliatingsuccession of withdrawals.    M. Venizelos had also impressed on thft Prime Minister that any attempt by the Allies to get rid o^-King Constantine would only rally the Greeks to him .
and. estabaish^him,-.more firmly on the throne,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff rr^rrtinned thatVenizelos had made clear that he had no part in thecoup 4&apos;-tat said to be contemplated against the officersof the Greek array, who-had been substituted by the presentGreek Government for the former Venizelist officers.    Piehad insisted that if the Greek army continued to be con-ducted as at present, within six months it would cease to exist.   And, in order to re-establish the Greek army on a useful footing it would be necessary to reinstate GeneralParaskevopoulos.. the former Commander-in*-Chief, and to change most of the officers down to Battalion Commanders.In return for these concessions King Constantine^would demandgood&apos; terms .(3) In arj.di.tion to the views of M. V&quot;anise las as sumraarisabove, the Committee had before there the following ----informs-tion:-A Summary of Intelligence in regard tothe condition of the Greek and Turkisharmies in Mesopotamia, circulated bythe Chief of the Imperial General staff as requested at the previous meeting(C.F.C, End Conclusions, No.5).(Papr*r C .F.C.-1.)A telegram from Sir H. Lamb, at Smyrna,forwarding inf information fxnm the british military Attache, Athens  (No.4-7, dated june 7th) , which contained a preliminaryestimate   giving the fighting strengthof the Greek forces as 100,000, comparedwith 60,000 fgrr the Nationalist forces,and announcing the postponement of the contemplated offensive for a few weeks,,Information communicated by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs that theItalians had begun to evacuate Adalia.Reference was also made to an article,apparently written under official in-opiration by the French journalist whouses the nom--de-plume of &quot;Pertinax&quot;.Information communicated by the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff that the XlthGreek Division had already left the IsmidPeninsula and gone further to the South.Information obtained by Sir Edward Grigg -   -fro??, Admiral Mark Kerr, to the effect that king Constantino was very hopeful of
^anrturing the Vine- SiSMa^nalorWU. 4am-ria^hL-mar, but had misgivings, as towhether- the staying power of the greeks would enable them to hold onin Asia Minor.&quot;The Chief of the Imperial General/.6&quot;ta-ff reported that since the last meeting he had ordered the British military attache- in Athens to proceed to Smyrna to report on thecondition and situation of the Greek Army,    General Harington,who had returned to Constantinople, was also about to submit a fresh report on the situation.The Prime Minister invited the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff &apos; (a) To Instruct the British military attache, Athens,  to make a special report on the Command, Staff and officers of the Greek army, asaffected by the changes made bythe present Greek Government:(b) To send, in addition, to Asia Minor, aGeneral Officer whose seniority, rank,experience and professional attainmentswould qualify him te- give authoritativeadvice to the British Government on theimportant military aspects ef the prob-formed confronting them.POLICY-&quot;BROOM-        (4)  The trend of the prolonged discussion on thy aboveMENDED.data was in favour of an approach being made by the allies to the Greek Government, with a view to obtaining their authority to make to the Turks  a proposal  for a settlementbased on a modification in favour of Turkey of the terms proposed at the  ireaent London Conference.    In order toprovide an inducement  to the Greek Government to make thenecessary concessions it would be necessary to undertakethat, in the event of a refusal of the terms by the Turks,the Allies would support the Greeks, not with militaryformations, but by other means, comprising a naval blockadein the Black Sea, facilities for acquiring munitions and war material, including aeroplanes,  the relaxation of any restrictions on their liberty of action in matters offinance, and, perhaps,  permission to engage ex-Service men
who might be willing to volunteer for service with the Greek forces.    Further, if the Turks should reject the terms offer-ed, and the Greeks should consequently be compelled to con-tinue the campaign,  in the event of their being victorious,the proposals about Smyrna, which were to form the basis of negotiation with the Turks, would necessarily be open to revision.    It was realised that if this occurred and the greeks were defeated, the Allies would be confronted with avery critical situation.    It was understood that the policy set forth above might have- to be modified in the light ofthe military reports,  or adjusted to the views of theFrench Government.The Gommittee agreed to tne following action:-(a) The War Office should prepare an apprecia-tion, based on the reports expectation-bed fromthe war area, of the value of the greek army on the alternative hypotheses  .(i) that it was fighting alone andunsupported:(ii) that it was fighting with Alliedsupport In the form of munitions,war&apos; materiel  and money:(b) The War Office should prepare particulars of the as sistanee which could he given under (a) (ii)  above:(c) The Admiralty should examine the feaai-inviolability of a blockade of Turkish port3to prevent the transport of munitions of war and other supplies from SovietRussia across the Black Sea for theuse of Mustapha Kemal&apos;S forces:(d) The Foreign Office should prepare a Mem-memorandum with a view to its presentationby the British Ambassador in Paris to theFrench Government, setting forth thepolicy propooed by the British Government,and including a general statement of theterms they propose should he offered tothe Greeks and Turks.    After obtaining the approval of the Prime Minister, theForeign Office should forward it to lord hardinge and instruct him to state thatif the^French Government considered itto provide a useful basis for discussion,Lord Curzon was prepared to visit M, Briandand discuss the whole natter with him:(e) The terms mentioned in the precedingConclusion   which ore to be offered to

(5) With reference to Cabinet 42 (31) s Conclusion 1, theCommitt-ee had a short discussion in regard to the present situationin Upper Silesia, as set forth in Sir H. Stuart&apos;s telegrams Nos.    ,178 and 179 of June 7th.    In the former of these it was stated thatthe French and Italian Commissioners (Generals le Rond and de Mar-Inis) had referred to their respective Governments -for -in^nKJiAiorrQ-regarding a proposal by Sir H, Stuart that the same energy shouldbe shown in dealing with the Polish rebels as has been adoptedagainst the German defence forces.
