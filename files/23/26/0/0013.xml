&quot;(1) With reference to Cabinet 9 (21) Conclusion 1,the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs covering a Draft convention on the subject of the Egyptian question (3.31)  (seeAppendix)  as well as a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War on &quot;Army Financial Aspects of the proposed change in the Status of Egypt&quot;.  (CP.3118)The Cabinet were informed that the Egyptian OfficialDelegation had now arrived and that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs would on the following day have a pre-liminary conversation with Adly Pasha, tho Egyptian primeMinister.      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then made a statement in amplification of his Memorandum, which.he explained, had been prepared to give Effect to what he understood to be the view of the Cabinet.(2)  In regard to the Military Occupation some discussion took place as to whether in view of the dependence of thoEuropean community, including the British Agency, for security on the British garrison, it would he safe to allow the troops to be quartered outside the towns.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertooknot to agree to quarter the troops outside the townswithout further discussion at the Cabinet afterconsultation with Lord Allenhy.He also agreed that the last Section of Article ii of the Draft Convenction (E.31)  should be amended(by the addition of the words underlined and the omission, of the same words at the end of the sentence)to read as follows :&apos;-&quot;They shall also at all times have facilities forthe acquisition and use of barracks, exercise grounds,aerodromes and naval yards, and for the free use ofnaval harbours at-ail-^inies-r &quot;(3) The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs took note ofthe proposals of the Secretary of State for har in regard to military Finance, and explained that he proposed to discussthe matter on tho following basis:
In so far as the- -occupyiai-g troops were needed forImperial duties they should he a charge on Imperialfunds, but in so far as they were required to protect the frontiors-of Egypt-from external-aggression and tosupport the police in the maintenance of internal order and the suppression of riot there should be a contribution from Egyptian funds.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook, if necessary, to give the Secretaryof State for har an opportunity to discuss this matter himself with the Egyptian Delegates.(4) The Cabinet, while recognising that concessions mighthave to be made in the course of the negotiations, expressedconsiderahle^urunriXLingnes-s to extend the control of ForeignAffairs to Egypt beyond the powers which they have possessedduring the greater port of tho British occupation.- The Secretory of State for Foreign affairs undertook not to make concessions on thispoint beyond those mentioned in Article III -of the Draft Conventionwithout further consultation with tho Cabinet.(5) The Cabinet agreed to the proposals in Article IV ofthe Draft Convention (E.31) in regard to the employmentof Foreign Officers.(6) Article V of the Draft Convention (E.ul)  on the subjectof Financial Control was approved, though the suggestion was made that this was one of the points where further concessions might be made without serious detriment toBritish interests.(7) The Cabinet agreed that in tho first sentence cfArticle VI of the Draft Convention/E.31)  on the subject of judicial Control the word &quot;Agreement&quot; should he substitutedfor &quot;consultation&quot;, so that the sentence would begin asfollows:-&quot;The Egyptian Government will appoint in agreementwith His Britannic . hajesty1 s Government a judicial&apos;Commissioner etc.,&quot;.
Ihe Sudan. (8) In connection with.Article VII of the DraftConvention on the subject of the Sudan, attention was drawn to the fact that this region, although atpresent a debit, was potentially an asset, to theEmpire, owing to the possibilities of growing cottonwhen tho irrigation works now under construction were completed and owing to the fact that the Sudan -would,on the completion of the works, hold the key to thewater supply of Egypt.Suez Canal.       (9) The Cabinet were informed that Article VIII.of theDraft Convention dealing with the Suez Canal was not essential to the proposed Treaty, although it had beenconsidered desirable to secure a renewal of the suez canal concession.This proposal was Criticised on the gsound that,although the British Government held a great part ofthe shares, and derived a useful revenue therefrom, theadministration of the Canal, which was dominated by Frenchinfluence, was unfriendly to British interests.Instances were given of the exercise of the powers ofthe administration in a direction hostile to Britishinterests, including the imposition of the highest possible rates which, operated mainly against british shipping (which was the principal use of the Canal) and opposition to the construction of a bridge or tunnelto connect the railway systems of Egypt and Palestine.The Cabinet agreed, however, that these objections *were less detrimental than a reversion of the canal to Egyptian hands and that Article VIII

of the Draft Convention should be pressed for by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,     They invited Lord Curzon,however, not to overlook the possibilityof making a better bargain with theCompany in favour of British interests as a condition of the continuance ofthe concession.Efficiency (10) The Draft Convention was criticised on theof theAdminlstratioiugeneral ground that it would result in a distinctand marked deterioration in the civil administration&amp;  Egypt,; which must react on the state of order and progress in the country.The Cabinet recognised tho probability of this,but considered that this was part of the risk whichhad to be run in order to secure a settlement .:The people of Egypt might prefer self-governmenteven at the cost of a reduction in efficiency.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to keep in view theimportance of efficiency, particularlyin the essontiaih matter of irrigation.Difficulties     (11) The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and dangers of the warned his colleagues first that Lord Ld.lner*sSituation.Commission had so far prejudiced the situation thatthe freedom of the Government in negotiation was severely hampered, and secondly, that there was a veryserious risk of further grave disorder in Egypt, whenthe aspirations of the Egyptian extremists were dis-appointed.      In this connection tho Cabinet were informed, that on the very same evening crowds ofEgyptians in taxi-cabs had greeted Adly Pasha outsidehis hotei in London with cries of &quot;Down with Adly.&quot;

The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed his colleagues that lie had mentioned the matter to Lord Ailenby, who hadnot attached Importance to it.The Cabinet, however, invited lord curzon, if he thought it would proveuseful, to sound the Egyptian PrimeMinister on the question.Subject to the observations recorded above,the Cabinet approved Lord curzon&apos;s proposals as representing the maximum&quot; of concessions tobe made to Egypt without further reference tothe Cabinet.
SEDUCTION OF       .(14 ) With. r^exeiic^^c^^l)ajae-i; S3 (21/ exclusion 6&apos;UBL-Ii2SPEhLITURE the Cabinet had before them a-Jlem^randum by Drsing addison (C.P.3108) and a Memorandum by the Minister^policy.of Health (CP.3111) together with the conclusions on Housing Policy of the Cabinet Finance committee held June 30th 1921.      (P.C035th Conclusions)The Minister of Health stated that he had arranged to state the Government policy on Housing in answer to a question in the House to be put this weekand he wished to be authorised to make certain modifications in the conclusions reached by theFinance Committee, vizas(a) To extend, by a few weeks the date ( July 1st)after which subsidies would not be granted to- private builders unless constructionhad been begun by that date.(b) 5To extend tho Treasury grant of  200s000 forthe next two financial years for the ameliorationof slums so that it shall be a maximum annualgrant for that amount and be coterminous with-   the currency of the loans raised by the LocalAuthorities,(c) To announce in the House that the government intend farther to explore the whole housingsituation and to ascertain whether it is possibleto devise some alternative methods by which thehousing needs of the working classes can be adequately met in consonance with ths financial difficulties cf the ration.The Minister without Portfolio (Lr Addison) protest -ed against the suspension of the Government:s housing policy involved in the conclusions of the finance committee.     He pointed out that when that policy wasembarked on two years ago houses were not being built by private enterprise and the State had been forced to utilise and assist tho Local Authorities and to subsid-iso.the private &quot;builders..    In the meantime the State and
the LocalL^tlioriti^ sorts -xif-^xommitmants.They had bought land, laid out roadSo^^^^xrepareA-sewers, servednotices on slum owners, all at the bidding of the Government, andsuddenly to interrupt and stop these arrangements would be a grave breach of faith not only with the contractors but also with ex-service men. who had been led to expect a great increasein the supply of small houses.     private builders unaided wouldnot provide such houses because they could not obtain an economicrent for them, and in any case the; - would -be restrained pendingthe continuance of the Rent Restriction Act.    The Governmentsprogran&amp;ne was one which had already scaled down the numberof houses asked first from 800,000 to 500,000 and then to300,000*     Of this,last number 50,000 was in respect of slums,and 50,000 it was hoped would be built by private enterprise,leaving 200,000 to local Authorities.     To reduce this numberstill further would not only be a breach of faith but would arouse great political opposition.   It was open to the liinisterof Health to secure certain economies by reducing the amount ofthe subsidy as the cost of building came down.In the course of the discussion stress was laid on the wide-spread disappointment which would be felt among the workingclasses at the suspension of house-building particularly as highhopes had been kindled among them at the last General Election,Housing conditions had been bad before the war .and the stoppage of building during the war had greatly aggravated the evil.The desire to remedy this acknowledged evil was common to all political parties and, it was urged, should not be given up atthe bidding of the anti-waste group.As against these considerations the Cabinet were asked to&apos;weigh the complete change in the the financial position of theCountry as compared with the prosperous period immediately follow-in^ the war, the unparalleled industrial de pression which hadensued with millions of unemployed, the strain of taxation which
was proving an almost intolerable burden espe8ially to themiddle classes,-and the consequent imperative duty of theGovernment to, reduce&apos; -expend -liabilities,,&apos; 4 ...&quot;for the present..The Cabinet(a) Took note ox the Conclusions of the finance committee (F.C335th Conclusions) and agreed(b) To alter the date for the termination of subsidiesfrom July 1st to July 15th ,(e) To authorise the Minister of Health in his statement to the House to promise that the whole housingsituation would be further explored with a view to amore economical provision of houses.(d) To request the following Minis teas to confer onthe exact fozm of the general statement to be made bythe Minister of HealthSir Bobert HomeSir A,kondMr .i...unroDr AddisonDr KacnamaraMr FisherMr lie CurdyMr To Jones (Secretary)
