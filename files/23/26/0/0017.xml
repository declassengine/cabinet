MESOPOTAMIA.

(1)With reference to Cabinet 57 (21), Conclcusion 3, the Secretary of state for the Colonies reported that the plebiscite in Mesopotamia was running strongly in favour of the Emir Feisal, and that the High Commissioner, proposed to proclaim him as King of Mesopotamia onAugust 15th.

(2)With reference to Cabinet 61 (21), Conclusion 2, the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a statement in regard to National Revenue and National Expenditure.

He recallod that the prospective revenue had already necessitated a demand that the Government Departments should out down expenditure by 20%. The financial out-look, however, was such that in the near future further economies would be essential, and there was very little prospect of achieving this by the ordinary departmental methods. In these circumstances be considered the best plan would be to appoint a strong independent Committee, which would command general confidence and respect and give its full time to the task, to make recommendations to the Cabinet for effecting forthwith all possible reductions in the National Expenditure on Supply Services, having regard especially to the present and prospective position of the Revenue. The Committee would have no right to criticise a policy, although it would be invited to state how much a particular policy cost, in order to furnish to the Government the data on which their decision would have to be taken.

Considerable discussion took place in regard to the principle of this proposal. It was criticised as lowering the dignity of the Cabinet and of Ministers. It might please the so-called Anti-waste Press for a time, but, in fact, it was Impossible to substitute Irresponsible outside




























































































































































































































































































































business men. for responsible- &quot;Ministers, or even effectively to supplement their activities.   The Cabinet were reminded that the matter had not yet been dismissed by the cabinet itself.     The proposals of the Departments had not even&quot;been circulated.     If the Committee was-suf^lclently..aampse*eh&amp;to effect great reductions in expendituret it ought to takethe responsibility and to become the Cabinet.   As the pro-posal stood the Go&amp;M&amp;tae would be irresponsiblej andnot amenable to Parliament or to anyone else.     Theappointment of business men Was criticised On the groundthat they had not proved particularly successful in adminis-tration and that this was being generally realised.    Itwas pointed out that this enquiry was part of the normalresponsibility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer;,    Theproposed Committee would amount to putting the Chancellor-ship of the Exchequer In commission^     The preparationof the questionnaire to be addressed to Departments wasitself the proper function of the Treasury.     The alternativesuggestion was made that if the Chancellor of the exchequer was toe pressed with public business to undertake the taskhimself, a series of groups of Cabinet Ministers shouldfee formed to assist the Ministers at the head of the greatspending Departments to examine into their expenditure.They might invite Ministers to formulate proposals for a5$, 10$j or 5Cf0 reduction, and the Cabinet its elf A onthe advice of a Cabinet Committee, would be the properjudge of what economies shoulS- be effectedeOn the other hand it was pclnted out that the Committeewas not to have any executive function.     Its report wasto bd mafle to the Cabinet and submitted for their approval.The Committee was not to proclaim a policy or even to express
(?)n opinion on policy. It would merely have the right to state what was the best of a particular policy. The cabinet were reminded of the overwhelming pressure of departmental work on Ministers, which rendered it extremely difficult for them to undertake extra departmental work or even to give as much time as they would wish to their parliamentary duties, much less themselves io undertake a detailed enquiry of this kind. The fact was recalled that the appeals made by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Finance Committee during the last two years had produced comparatively meagre results. The Prime Minister himself, in the present overwhelming  pressure of public affairs, could not possibly devote his personal attention to the details of  departmental expenditure The same was true of the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Other Ministers urgently needed a holiday and could not possibly devote their vacation to this task. Moreover, the delicate position of a Minister at the head of one spending Department criticising a Minister at the head of another was indicated. Hence, the choice really lay between the Committee now proposed and no proper inquiry at all. The suggestion that the proposal was lowering to the dignity of the Cabinet was rebutted. The claim was made that no new doctrine was Involved. For years it had been customary to appoint outside Commissions to advise on matters of Departmental responsibility, and several examples were given. The advantage was pointed out of a single Committee which would co-ordinate the proposals for reduction in the various Departments. In favour of the appointment of the Committee it was further urged that its report might be of great value to the Government in effecting economies, and more particularly in resisting the almost invariable criticism in the House
of Commons that they selected the wrong- economies * Itwould probably also result in vindicating the Governmentiri many respects.On a review of the considerations briefly summarised above, and after a very full discussions the Cabinet agreed?-(a) To authorise the Prime Minister to appoint an independent Committee&apos;to make reccmmoh-dations to the Cabinet for effecting forthwithall:&apos;.possible reduction in the national expenditure on Supply,Services, havingregard especially to the present and pros-pec tive position of the revenue.*(b) Thai the report of the Committee shouldbe Secret until the Cabinet have deaidedwhether and when a whole or a part shouldbe published;(c) That tha composition of the Conriitte*should be left 4o the Prime ministers the personnel suggested being generally agreed to.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES asked thathis dissent from the above conclusions might be formallyrecorded^IRELAND.        (5)   With reference to Cabinet Sl?(2l) tho Cabinet hadMilitary before them the Conclusions and the Report of a CommitteeLaw. ,on Military Law in Ireland which had been appointed bjfthe Prime Minister, under the Chairmanship of the L^rdChancellor, to examine with special reference to recent.events In Ireland, the steps to be taken to establishfirmly the position off the Military Governor under martial law   so that his proceedings shall&amp;e recognised as finaland unaffected1 by       proceedings In a court of law*(C*P. 3185)4m *h*
The Cabinet were informed that the release *f the twoprisoners involves ** Joseph Egan and Patrick Higgles- hadbeen authorised on Friday last on the-express advice ofthe lord Chancellor of Ireland who was acting on behalf ofthe Viceroys during loid Fitsalan,s absence from Ireland.Sir John Boss had urged that the movement for peace inIreland would be gravely prejudiced if the order of the HighCourt were flouted and it had been understood, when authorising-ing the release of the two prisoners, that a similar situation-ion was not likely to arise In the case of the other prison-ers under sentence of death.The Cabinet were also informed that sir John Ross, whohad been summoned to London for consultation, had been -enableto come over for reasons cf healths and that information had reached the Chief Secretary that the Master of the Roils was unlikely to sit in Court on Thursday,    as originally he had proposed to dor,   A formal appeal had been made against hisruling in the case but this would not be heard until October24th as the r*ong Tacation had begun.The Cabinet agreed -fl]!To adopt the views sot forth in the Report of the Iicru Chancellor?3 ooaeaittee., (Cop, 5165)(2)To asfe the l,or3 Chancellor and the At^rney general to prepare for the leader of the House a seply to aQuestion 3 setting forth The le,p%l positionand indicating that the Master of the Rolls was wrong in law but that the Cabinet a**ing on theadvice of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland agreed toiaa e an exception in favour of the two prisonersrather than seriously enaanger the negotiations for peace which were in progress.(4)   In reply to a question by the Secretary of Statefor War tho Prisrs Minister stated that Mr de Yalerahad agreod that if negotiations broke down reasonablenotice of the termination of the truce should be given.
