(1) With reference tc Cabinet 52 (21), Conclusion 2, theCabinet met to consider the resumption of negotiations ar-ranged to take place half an hour later between the G-overn-reassessment , the mine-cmmrs and the miners,The Prime Minister reported that on the previous day he himself, in company with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,at Chequers, had had a prolonged interview with some of theMiners&apos; Leaders.    The Prime Minister hirsself had taken up avery stiff line about the grant of the  10,000,000 subsidy to the miners, which had.been withdrawn after the failure ofthe last negotiations.    He had become convinced, however, inthe course of the interview, that it was impossible for theminers to resume work in sopoe districts without the  10,000,00:He had also come to the conclusion that the plan of lendingthe  10,000,000 with a view to its ultimate recovery fromthe trade was not a feasible one.    The Prime Minister had then asked if,  in the e^ent of the Government sines idy being given, the miners v:ould be ordered back to wcrh on V/ednesdaynext without any further negotiation or ballets.    The Miners&apos;Leaders (Mr Herbert Smith, Mr Prank Hodges and Mr Rcbson)had intimated that they themselves would break away if theExecutive of the Miners&apos;  Federation refused to adopt areasonable attitude aft^r the subsidy of  10,000,000 had been offered.    The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the exchequer-quer had made it clear that they had no authority from theCabinet to agree to the re-grant of the  10,000,000.    TheMiners&apos; Leaders had undertaken to cor.sr.lt their colleaguesbefore   the meeting to he held at noon.After some discussion, during which mention was madeof the objection entertained in some quarters to the re-grantof the subsidy, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister and his colleagues should have full discretion, during theforthcoming negotiations, to renew the-offer of the  10,000,000 subsidy to theminers on such conditions as they might deem&apos;advisable:
(b) That the Leader of the Houee of Commons,in reply te questions, should indicate in general terms the un&amp;esirability offettering the negotiating Ministers, andshould intimate the intention of the Gov-..emment, in the event of the  10,000,000subsidy being granted, to move the vote on Friday next. : By these means the house would have the opportunity cf raising thequestion today on the adjournment, should it so desire, and the Government would been abled to ascertain the state of feeling in the House on the subject.TURKEY.The Greek&apos;Refusal ofthe AlliedOffer.(2) With reference to Cabinet 52 (21), Conclusion 1,the Cabinet had before them the reply of the GreekGovernment refusing the offor of the Allied Powers.Owing to the forthcoming meeting in connection withthe Coal negotiations, there was not time for a full ex-amination of the position.      In a short discussion, however,there was general agreement that our object was to secure a cessation of fighting as soon as possible, and that bothsides must be treated on the same footing.      The suggestion was made that the offer refused by the Greeks should nowbe made to both parties, and that the Allies should intimate that a blockade would be applied to either sidewhich refused to treat on these terms.The question was adjourned forfurther consideration, the lord privy Seal and the. Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs beingauthorised, in the meantime, to read to Parliament the Greek .reply, and to rofuso to give anyreply to questions on tho subject which might in any way fetter theGovernment in its future action.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 27th, 1921.
