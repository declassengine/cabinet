of the reply which had heeh^^T^ed-ve^-from-Mr. de V &amp;e5 dated August 24th (C P.3258).     In his view, if HisMajesty^ -Governntent could ignore the offensive toneof the reply and return an answer which would not involve a loss of dignity- negotiations could heresumed.     The resumption of negotiations was thereal desire of the Sinn Fein leaders, who consideredthat the hostile tone cf their Communications was of no consequence since His Majesty1s Governmentwere well aware that it was not intended.Mr, Cope, the Assistant Under-Secretary for ireland,here entered at the request of the PrimeMinister and gave his views.     He thought that the sinn Fein leaders desire? to come to England once more and to settle finally.     The whole point of Mr,de Valera-*s reply was In the final paragraph, thepreceding paragraphs being a repetition of his speechesdesigned for propaganda and to obtain the united supportof all parties in Dail Eireann, including theIrre cone liable s.     Mr. de Valeral&apos;s object had been taobtain from his support/a vote of full confidence and then to demand that settlement of the negotiations should beleft entirely in his hands.     The governing principlereferred to, i.e. government by consent of the governedwould be accepted by Mr. de Valera as applicable to northern Ireland as well as to the rest of that country.It was pointed out that whilst the real intentions of the Sinn Fein leaders might be those attributed tothem above, whenever any communications in writing were received, they gave prominence to &quot;Independence for ireland&quot;, Irelandrs desire to be a &quot;Sovereign State&quot;and similar aspirations *     Such phraseology was notconducive to negohation.

THE PRIME MINISTER1S REPLY TO MR DE VALERA *SLETTER DATED AUGUST 24thfl 1921o, SECRET -APPENDIX,CP. 3262.10, Downing Street,London,Ss Wo I oAugust 26th, 1921,Sir,The British Government are profoundly disappointed by your letter of August 24th, which was delivered to me yesterday 0You write of the conditions of a Meeting between us as though no meeting had ever taken placeo     I must remind   you,therefore, that when I asked you to meet me six weeks ago,I made no preliminary conditions of any sort..     You came to London on that invitation and exchanged views with me at three meetings of considerable length.     The proposals whichI made to you after those, meetings were based upon full andsympathetic consideration of the views which you expressed.As 1 have already said, they were not made in secretary hagglingspirito     On the contrary, my colleagues and I went to thevery limit of our powers In endeavouring tc reconcile Britishand Irish interests^     Our proposals have gone far beyondall precedent, and have been approved as liberal by the wholecivilised world.     Even in quarters which have shown a sympathy with the most extreme of Irish claims, they are regardedas the utmost which the Empire can reasonably offer or Irelandreasonably expect.     The only criticism of them which I have yet heard outside Ireland Is from those who maintain that our proposals have outstepped both warrant and wisdom in theirliberality.     Your letter shows no recognition of this, andfurther negotiations must, I fear, be futile unless some definite progress is made towards acceptance of a basis.You declare that our proposals involve a surrender ofIreland*s whole national position and reduce her to subservi-ence.     What are the facts?   Under the settlement which we- 1 -
have outlined Ireland would control every nerve and fibre ofher national existence; she would speak her own language and make her own religious life; she would have complete powerover taxation and finance, subject only to an agreement foraskeeping trade and transport/free as possible between herselfand Great Britain, her best market; she would have un-controlled authority over education and all the moral andspiritual Interests of her race; she would have it also overlaw and order, over land and agriculture, over the conditionsof labour and Industry, over the health and homes of her people,and over her own land defonce.     She would, in fact, within theshores of Ireland, be free in every aspect of national activity,national expression and national development.     The States of theAmerican Union, sovereign though they be, enjoy no such range of rights.     And our proposals go even further, for they inviteIreland to take her place as a partner in the gre at common-wealth of free nations united by allegiance to the King,We consider that these proposals completely fulfil yourwish that the principle of &quot;government by consent of thegoverned&quot; should be the broad guiding principle of the settle-ment which your plenipotentiaries are to negotiate.     that principle was first developed in England, and is the mainspringof the representative institutions which she was the first tocreate.     It was spread by her throughout the world, and is now the very life of the British Commonwealth,     We could nothave invited the Irish people to take their place in that commonwealth on any other principle, and we are convinced that-through it we can heal the old misunderstandings and achievean endilring partnership as honourable to Ireland as to theother nations of which the Commonwealth consists.But when you argue that the relations of Ireland with theBritish Empire are comparable in principle to those of Holland
or Belgium with the German Empire, I find it necessary to repeat once more that those are promises whioh no British Government, whatever its complexion, can ever accept. In demanding that Ireland should be treated as a separate sovereign Power, with no allegiance to the Crown and no loyalty to the sister nations of the Commonwealth, you are advancing claims which the most famous national leaders in Irish history, from Grattan to arnell and Redmond, have explicitly disowned. Grattan in a famous phrase declared that "the ocean protests against separation, and the sea against union",   Daniel 0&apos;Connell, the most eloquent perhaps of all the spokesmen of the Irish national cause, protested thus in the House of Commons in 1830:-

"Lever did monarch receive more undivided allegiance than the present King from the men who in Ireland agitate the Repeal of the Union, Never, too, was there a grosser, calumny than to assert that they wish to produce a separation between the two countries. Never was there greater mistake than to suppose that we wish to dissolve the connection."

?nd in a well-known letter to the duke of Wellington in 1845, Thomas Davis, the fervent exponent of the ideals of Young Ireland, wrote:-

"I do not seek a raw repeal of the Act of Union, I want you to retain the Imperial parliament with its Imperial power. I ask you only to disencumber it of those cares whioh exhaust its patience and embarrass its attention,  I ask you to give Ireland a Senate of some sort, selected by the people, in part or in whole; levying their Customs and. Excise and other taxes; making their roads, harbours, railways, canals, and bridges;    encouraging their manufacture ; commerce agriculture and fisheries; settling their Poor Laws, their tithes, tenures, Grand Juries and franchises; giving a vent to ambition, an opportunity for knowledge, restoring the absentees securing work, and diminishing poverty, crime ignorance and discontent. This, were I an Englishman, I should ask for England, besides the Imperial Parliament. So would I for Wales, were I a Welshman, and for Scotland, were I a Scotchman; this I ask for Ireland."

The British Government have offered Ireland all that O&apos;onnell and Thomas Davis asked, and more; and we are not only by an
unqualified demand that we should recognise Ireland as aforeign power.     It is playing With phrases to suggest -thatthe principle of government by consent of the governedcompels a recognition of that demand on our part, or thatin repudiating It we are straining geographical and histor-ical considerations to justify a claim to ascendency overthe Irish race.     There is no political principle, howeverclear, that can be applied without regard, to limitations imposed by physical and historical facts.     Those limitationsare as necessary as the very principle Itself to the structure of every free nation;    to deny them would involvethe dissolution of all democratic States.     It is on theseelementary grounds that we.have called attention to thegoverning force of the geographical propinquity of thesetwo islands, and of their long historic association despitegreat differences of character and race.     We do not believethat the permanent reconciliation of Great Britain and Irelandcan ever be attained without a recognition of theirphysical and historical interdependence, whioh makes com-plete political and economic separation impracticable for both,I cannot better express the British standpoint^Jjj-Jtiii-s..respect than in words used of the &quot;iio^^iorn and SouthernStatea.J3y&quot;&quot;Abrahairrtlnooln-^-S &quot;^fche Fdasst ilsaa^ural-Address.They were spoken by him on the brink of the American CivilV/ar, which he was striving to avert:-&quot;    Physically speaking (he said) Mwe cannotseparate.     &apos;:&amp; cannot remove our respectivesections from each other, nor build an impass-able wall between them.    ... It is Impossible^-then, to make that intercourse more advantage-ous or more satisfactory after separation than before.    0\9   Suppose you go to war, you oannotfight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you ceasefighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.&quot;I do not think it ca i be reasonably contended that thorelations of Great Britain and Ireland are in any different.case,-1, :,;Lc-&apos;a ivA       m: e i/*-4.*-&apos; v&apos;/-/vt icl ftfr.
I thought 1 had made it clear, both in my conversations with you and in ray two subsequent communications? that weban discuss no1 settlement which Involves a refusal on thepart of Ireland to accept our invitation to freei equal andloyal partnership in the British Commonwealth under oneSovereigns     We are reluctant to precipitate the issue, butwe must point out that a prolongation of the present stateof affairs is dangerous.     Action is being taken in variousdirections which, if continued, would prejudice the truceand must ultimately lead to its termination.     This would indeed be deplorable.     Whilst, therefore, prepared to make every allowance as to time which will advance the cause ofpeace, we cannot prolong a mere exchange of notes *     It isessential that some definite and immediate progress shouldbe made towards a basis upon which further negotiationscan usefully proceed.     Your letter seems to us unfortunatelyto show no such progress.In this and my previous letters I have set forth the considerations which must govern the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in any negotiations which they undertake.     Ifyou are prepared to examine how far these considerations canbe reconciled w1th the aspirations which you represent,I shall be happy to meet you and your colleagues.I am,Sir,Yours faithfully,(Signed) D* LLOYD GEORGE.Eamonn de Valera, Esq.,Mansion House,DUBLIN.
