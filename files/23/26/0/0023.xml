(3) With reference to Cabinet 67 (21), Conclusion 6 the Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet that he had seen 

Mr Asquith and Mr Clynes in regard to the discussion on the Consolidated Fund Bill to take place on the following day.

Mr Asquith had asked that the Prime Minister should make a statement in regard to the recent meeting of the Supreme Council, and the Prime Minister had replied that such a statement would comprise:-

UPPER SILESIA,

SANCTIONS ON THE RHINE,

RUSSIAN RAMONE,

ASIA MINOR (which Mr Asquith had wished to discuss) and possibly also WAR CRIMINALS.

During the meeting the Lord Privy Seal arrangad that Mr Asquith should be notified that the Prime Minister wouldalso make a statement in regard to:-

THE IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.

Mr Asquith had then raised the question of Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Committee on Expenditure. He had displayed no desire for a parliamentary Committee, and his main criticism had been that premature publicity had been given to the enquiry, whioh would have been unobjectionable to him if it had merely been called into being by the Chanoellor of the Exchequer to assist him. In short, Mr Asquith had oritioised the form, though approving the Committee in substance.

Mr Clynes had displayed no great interest in the Committee on Expenditure.

In regard to Ireland Mr Asquith had indicated his willingness to support the policy of the Government, as had Mr J.H.Thomas also. Mr ?, however, had not been able to express a definite opinion until he had leagues.


(4) With reference to Cabinet 62 (2l), Conclusion 1,arising out of the di^*ai&amp;*sd,oh suicffiarised. in the previousConclusion $ the Cabinet had a short discussion in regard tothe Terms of Reference to and. mei/Jbership of the Committee on government Expenditure^ and had before them a Memorandum onthe Financial Position* by the Seoretary of State for India(Paper C.P.-3208).The Cabinet were reminded in this connection that nothing had been included in any Government announcement which would preclude the Prime Minister and the Chancellorof the Exchequer, as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,from appointing the Committee themselves to advise them.This, procedure was felt by the Cabinet to possess consider-able advantages and to be consistent with constitutionalusage and prooedure.There was general agreement that nothing would be gained by adding Members of Parliament to the Committee.The Cabinet agreedThat tha Prime Minister should be author-ised to annouuoe that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer intended within the coming&apos;wto to o^arhaui Government expenditure and to appoint a Committee to assist him.whioh would be composed as followsSir Erie Geddes (in the Chair),Lord Inehcape?Lord Farringdon.Sir Joseph Maclay,Sir Guy Granet *with the following Terms of Referenoe:-BTo make recommondations to the Chanoellorof the Exchequer for effecting forthwithall possible reductions in the national expenditure on Supply Services havingregard especially to the present and pros-peotive position of the Revenue. In so faras questions of policy are involved in theexpenditure under discussion these willremain for the exclusive consideration ofthe Cabinet:   but it will be open to theCommittee to review the expenditure and toindicate the economies which might be ef-fected if particular polioies were eitheradopted $ abandoned or modified.&quot;

Apart ;frcmthue Ministers ofthe TlnA^edJKingdom and the Dominions net cn eleven occasions,and eight meetings of Committees were held at the ColcnialOfficerThe greater part of the proceGflixgs\ particularly thatrelating to Foreign Affairs and Defence, was of a highlyconfidential character, comparable rather to the work of theImperial War Cabinets cf 1917 and 1918 than cf the imperial war Conferences of those years.     Other parts, though not sosecret in their nature, were intermingled with matter whichmust for the present be kept cej&amp;fidsntjlal.     In regard to such discussions only an indication has been given here of their general tenor.11.QPKMG STATEMENTS.Mr. Lloyd George, as Chairman, opened the proceedingswith a comprehensive review of the situation in which theConference had assembled.     He outlined its tasks, statedbroadly the principles of policy which commended themselvesto the British Government, and dwelt upon the significance ofthe Conference and the importance of it3 work..     He was followed in turn by all the other Prime Ministers, by Mr. Sastri forIndia, and by Mr. Churchill for the Colonies and Pro-protectorates.     This preliminary discussion occupied two days.The speeches were published in full immediately afterwards,and are attached to this summary.
The Conformance-then addressed itvof the foreign Policy of the British I K^&apos; -this was opened by the Seoretary of SIwho made an exhaustive statement uponaffairs since the Peace Conference.    j-supplemented by Mr.Churchill, who dealof the Middle Bast.There followed &quot;a series of importwere largely conversational in form, eawvonlng in turn as occasion prompted, without fdrmality of anykin&amp;u The objects in view ware threefold - first, that themembers of the Conference should all put their ideas into thecommon stock and thus gain a thorough understanding of eachotherrs point of view; second, that the principal questions offoreign policy should be examined by this means from every pointof view;    and third, that there should be a free and full dis-discussion of the general aims and methods to bo pursued.     Thediscussions, which covered the whole area of foreign policy and extended, over many days, proved most fruitful in all these respects.       They revealed a unanimous opinion as to the mainlines to be followed by British policy, and a doep goalietion  .that tho whole weight of the Empire, should be concentratedbehind a united understanding and common action in foreignaffairs.       In this contest, very careful consideration wasgiven to the- means of circulating information to the DominionGovernments and keeping them in&apos;continuous touch with theconduct of foreign relations by the British Government.     Itwas unanimously felt that the policy of the British Empirecould not be adequately representative of democratic opinion throughout its peoples unless representatives of the Dominionsand of India were, frequently associated with those of the UnitedKingdom in considering and determining the course to bo pursued.
FOREIGN POLICY,Tho Conference-then address ed itself&quot;-to a detailed considerationof the foreign Policy of the British Empire.       The discussion onthis was opened by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,    iwho made an exhaustive statement upon the course of foreignaffairs since the Peace Conference.       His statement wassupplemented by Mr.Churchill, who dealt with the special problemsof the Middle East.There followed a series of important discussions, which,were largely conversational in form, each representative inter-voning in turn as occasion prompted, without formality of any kind- The objects in view were threefold - first, that themembers of the Conference should all put their ideas into thecommon stock and thus gain a thorough understanding of eachothsrTs point of view; second, that the principal questions offoreign policy should be examined by this means from every pointof view;    and third, that there should be a free and full dis-discussion of the general aims and methods to bo pursued.

Itwas unanimously felt that the policy of the British Empirecould not be adequately representative of democratic opinion throughout its peoples unless representatives of the Dominionsand of India were, frequently associated with those of the UnitedKingdom in considering and determining the course to bo pursued. All
members of the Conference expressed a vivid sense of the value ofthis year1e meeting in that respeot and a desire that similarmeetings should be held as frequently as possible a precedent created by the Imperial War Cabinet wao also revivedwith valuable results.    2&apos;rom 1916 till the Armistice the PrimeMinisters of the Dominions and the Representatives of India fre-quently sat with members of the British Cabinet to determine themeasures neoessary for the prosecution of the war.    This method ofprocedure was also adopted by the British empire Delegation duringthe Peace Conference in Paris, when all cardinal decisions were takenby the Delegation, as a whole.    In accordance with this precedentthe Prime Ministers of the Dominions and the Representatives ofIndia present in London this year were Invited to meetings with members of the British Cabinet called to deal with Imperial andforeign questions of. immediate urgency which arose in the course ofthe sittings^One of the most important of these sssse the Upper Milesian ques-tion, whloh during the session of the Conference assumed an acuteform, and was debated at eaoh stage by the members of the Conference,whose interest in a matter so closely affecting the relations ofGreat Britain and Franco was incontestable,   Tho main lines ofBritish policy in connection with the solution of this problemrecoived tho unanimous approval of the Conference, and it was with satisfaction that they heard, before the termination of their sitt-Ings, that, the preliminary difficulties having been resolved, thefinal settlement of the question of the Silesian frontier wasremitted^ under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, to animmediate meeting of the Supreme Council at Paris.The problems of the Western Pacific and the Par Bast* togetherwith tho Anglo-Japanese Agreement, were also fully discussed; and president Harding&apos;s invitation to a Conference on Disarmament waswarmly weloomed by all tho members of the Conference.   The following statement, made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons onJuly 11th, represents the general view of all members of the Con-foronoe on the main issues of the Paoifio as also on tho questionof disarmament  :-
The broad lines of Imperial policy in the pacific and the Par Bast were the. ^ory firstsubjects to which wte addressed ourselves atthe meetings of the, Imperial Cabinet, having aspecial regard to the Anglo-Japanese Agreement,the future&quot;of Chinak and the bearing of both those questions on the relations of the BritishBmpire with the United States.   v?e were guidedin our deliberations by three main considera-tions.    In Japan, we have an old and provedAlly.   The agreement of 26 years&apos; standing between us has been of very great benefit j not onlyto ourselves and her, but to the p?ace of the far East.   In China there is a very numerouspeople, with great potentialitiesi who esteemour friendship highly, and whose interests we9on our side, desire to assist and advance.   Inthe United States we see to-day, as we have always seen, the people closest to our own aims and ideals with whom,it Is for us, not merelya degi.re and an interest, but a deeply-rootedinstill to co nsult and co-operate.   Those werethe mailt considerations in our meetings, and upon them we were unanimous.   The object ofour discussions was to find, a method combiningall these three factors in a-policy * which would .remove the danger of heavy naval expenditure inthe Pacific, with all the evils which such an expenditure entails, and would ensure thedevelopment, of all legitimate national interestsof the Par EastaWe had In the first place, to ascertain ourexact position with,regard to the Anglo-JapaneseAgreement.   There hao/^fluch do doubt as to whether the notification to the League of Nations made last july constituted a denunciation of the agreement in the sense of Clause 6.   If It did, It wouldhave been necessary to decide upon some interim measure regarding the Agreement pending fullerdiscussions with the other Pacific Powers, and negotiations with this object, in view were, in point pf fact, already in progress.    If, on theother hand, it did not, the Agreement would remainin fore,   until denounced, whether by Japan orby ourselves, and would not be actually determineduntil 12 months from the date when notice ofdenunciation was given*\   The Japanese government took the view that no notice of denunciation had yet been givers,     This view was shared by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs % but, asconsiderable doubt existed, we decided, after a preliminary discussion in the Imperial Cabinet, torefer the question t) the Lord Chancellor/ whoconsidered it with the Law Officers of the Crown,and held that no notice of denunciation had yetbeen given*a0a
It follows that the Anglo-JapaneseAgreement remains in force unless it isdenounced, and will lapse only at the expira---tion of 12 months from the time when noticeof denunciation la.given.    It is- however,the desire of &quot;both the British Empire and japan that the Agreement should be broughtInto complete harmony with the Covenant ofthe lie ague of Nations $ and that wherever the Covenant and the Agreement are inconrsiatervc- t- the terms of the Covenant shallprevail.   Notice to this effect has nowbeen gi-g-en to the League*The broader discussion of Par Easterreand Pacific policy to which we then turned showedgoco^al iVr.-v.it on the main lines of the coursewh.&apos;.:h th^ &apos; i/uoarial Cabinet-desired to pursue^ Ihave all ealy explained that the first principleof our policy was friendly m -operation with theUnited Stateeo   We are a&amp;l convinced that uponthlOj were than any single factor, depends thepeace and well-being of the world.   We alsodesire, as   have stated, to maintain our closefriendship and co-operation with Japan*   Thegreatest merit of that valuable friendship isthat it harmonises the influence and activitiesof the two greatest Asiatic Powers, and thusconstitutes an essential safeguard to the well-being of the British Empire end peace of theBasts   We also aim at preserving the open doorin China, and at giving the Chinese peopleevery opportunity of peaceful progress anddevelopment.In addition to these considerations, we desire to safeguard our own vital interests inthe Pacific, and to preclude any competition in naval armaments between the Pacific Powers..   All.,the representatives of the Empire agreed.thatour standpoint oh these questions should be communi-communicated with complete frankness to the United;States,Japan and China, with the object of securing an exchange of views which might lead to more formaldiscussion and conference.   The Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs accord! ngly held cmver-sations last week with the American and JapaneseAmbassadors and the Chinese Minister, at whichhe communicated to them the views of the imperial cabinet, and asked in turn for the views of theirrespective government so     He expressed at these conversations a very strong hope that this exchangeof views might, if their Governments sharedour desire in that respect, pave the w&amp;y for aconference on the problems      the Pacific and theFar East.
tipThe views of the President of the UnitedStates were made public by tr.e AmericanGovernment this morning0   I&apos;&quot;t is known to theHouse,   Mr,Harding has taker. .the momentousstep of inviting the Powoi-f to a Conferenceon the limitation of armaments, to be heldin Washington in the near future, and he also suggests a preliminary meeting onPacific and Par Eastern luestions betweenthe Powers most directly Interested in thepeace and welfare of that great, region, which *is assuming the first importance in inter-national affairs.   I need not say that we welcome with the utmost pleasure PresidentHarding&apos;s wise and courteous initiative,In saying this I know that I speaic for theEmpire as a whole.   The world has beenlooking tp the United States for such a lead,I am confident that the House Will esteem It aa anas an act of far-seeing statesmanship and willwhole-heartedly wish it success..    I needhardly say that no effort will be lacking tomake it so on the part of the British empire which shares to the full the liberal and progressive spirit&quot;djisp^Ring It.
In accordance with the suggestion, which was believed tohave been made by the American Government, that the Conferenceon Disarmament should be preceded by friendly conversationsor consultations between the Powers who were principally concerned in the future of the Par East and the Pacific,the Imperial Conference, in the firm conviction that the later discussions on Disarmament, to which they attached atranscendant importance, could only be made effective by a previous mutual understanding on Pacific questions betweenthe Powers above referred&apos; to, devoted many hours of examination to the question how such an understanding could best be arrived at, where the proposed conversations could best be held; in wh**t manner the representatives of theBritish Dominions, who were so vitally affected, could mosteasily participate in them; and upon what broad principlesof policy it was desirable to proceed.    It was difficult for the Dominion Prime Ministers,&quot; owing to the exigencies oftime and space, to attend at Washington late in the Autumn.On the other hand, advantage might be taken of their presence .in England to excha nge views with representatives of theother Great Powers who had been invited to Washington later on.It */as In these circumstances that the idea was mooted that thepreliminary conversations or consultations, to which theAmerican Government had in principle agreed, should be heldin London,VThen it transpired a little later that the American ,Government owing,It Is believed,to some misunderstanding of -the views and attitude of the Imperial Conference, were opposedto the holding of any such preliminary conversations save on american soil, the British Government, in the earnest desireto remove any possible misconception, and to meet the Americanviews at each stage of the impending discussions, volunteeredto attend a meeting on the other side of the Atlantic, atwhich the agenda of the forthcoming Conference at Washingtoncould be discussed, &quot;and a friendly interchange of views takeplace in order to facilitate the work of ..........
of the main Conference later on.    The British Prime Ministerand Poreign Secretary together tfith the Dominion Prime.&quot;       &apos; . tMinisters were prepared to attend such a meeting, if invitedto do so by the American Government.The Japanese Government signified their&apos; willingnessjif invited, to take part in the suggested conversations.The American Government, however, did not favour theidea, which was accordingly dropped.This conclusion was viewed with the*utmost rec^etby the members fr-f the Imperial Conference i who had devotedno small portion of time to the-working out of an arrangement,Which they understood would be equally acceptable to all parties, and the abandonment of which could not, they feared;be otherwise than prejudicial to the great &quot;Objects whichall had in view. *At no sta^e had it been -suggested thatthe results of such a consultation as wafer contemplated should either anticipate the work or tie the hands of theWashington Conference at a later date.   On the contrarythe sole intention of the Imperial Conference was to pro-.mote its momentous but complicated task to which they wish^ every possible success.
IV,    LEAGUE Off NATIONS-.A&apos;discussion took place in regard to the League p.fNations during which Mr. Balfour explained at length thework which had been carried out by the League and thespecial difficulties with which it has to contend.     Mr.Balfour fs statement was published in full, and will beincluded in a Blue Book to be issued shortly.While a more equitable distribution between its membersof the cost of the League was considered essential to its future, there was general appreciation of its work and ofthe League&apos;s claim to tho support of the British Empire asa step forward in the regulation of International affairs,V.   EGYPT.    .Close consideration was given to the question of british policy In Egypt, and the future status of that country, andgeneral agreement was reached regarding the principles by whichHis Majesty1 ss Government should be guided in the negotiationswith the Egyptian Delegation...   VI.    IMPERIAL DEFENCE..(a] Naval.Several plenary meetings and several meetings of thePrime Ministers alone with tho Seoretary of State for india were devoted to considering the Naval Defence of the Empire-,.and the following Resolution was adopted:-That, while recognising the necessity of co-operation among the various portions of the Empireto provide such Naval Defence as may prove to be essential for security, and, while holding thatequality with the naval strength of any otherPower is a minimum standard for that purpose, this conference is of opinion that the method and expense of such co-operation are matters for thefinal determination of the several Parliamentsconcerned, and that any recommendations thereonshould be deferred until after the coming Conferenceon Disarmament.in

A Resolution was also adopted to the effect that, pending the constitution of a permanent Committee on Shipping, the existing Imperial Shipping Committee should oontinue its enquiries.
The representatives of His Majesty1s Governmentand the Governments of Hew Zealand and India were readyto agree to a wider resolution recommending the constitu-tion under Royal Charter of a permanent Committee to carryout the duties specified in the Report of the imperial shipping Committee dated 3rd June, viz:-(a) to perform such duty as may he entrusted to them under laws in regard to Inter-Imperial Shipping,applicable to the whole or to important parts ofthe Umpire:(b) to enquire into.complaints in regard to oceanfreights and conditions in Inter-Imperial trade or questions of a Similar nature referred to themby any of the Governments of the Empire:(c) to exercise conciliation between the interests concerned in Inter-Imperial Shipping:(d) to promote co-ordination $n regard to harbours and other facilities necessary for Inter-imperial shipping.The representative of Canada, however, did not agree to this wider resolution, and the representatives ofthe Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of SouthAfrica reserved the matter for further consideration-..The position as regards rebates was discussed and strong representations were made by Dominion Ministers inregard to it, bull no resolution was passed, it being under-stood that the matter is at present under considerationby the Imperial Shipping Committee..

POSITION OF-&quot;BRITISH XNPIASS IB THE EMPIRE.The question of the position of British Indians inthe Empire was discussed first at a plenary meeting whenthe representatives of -India fully explained the situatioand tho views held in India on the subject.   The question was then remitted to a special Committoa under theChairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
At a final meeting on the subject the followingResolution was adopted the Conference, while reaffirming theResolution of the Imperial War Conference of1018, that each community of tho BritishCommonwealth should enjoy Gomplote oentrol ofthe composition of its own population by moans of restriction on immigration from any   ofthe&quot;other communities, recognises that thereis an incongruity botween the position ofIndia as an equal member of the BritishEmpire and tho existence of disabilitiesupon British Indians lawfully domiciled insome other parts of the Empire.     TheConference accordingly is of the opinion thatin the interests of the solidarity of theBritish CoEaaonweaith, it is desirable that  ^the&apos; rights of such Indians to citizenshipshould be recognised.&quot;The representatives of.South Africaregret their inability to accept this resolution in view of the exceptionaloirouast&amp;noes of the greater part of theUnion.$he representatives of Xnfiia^whileexpressing their appreciation of thoacceptance of the resolution reeorded above,feel bound to place on record.their profoundeonoern at the position of Indians inSouth Africa and their hope that by negotia-tion between the Governments of India andof South -Afeioaj, soma way &amp;&amp;n bo fomdpasse*8&amp;.as may be, to reach a more satisfactorypositiouo2a   EMPIRE SETTLEMENT AffS MIGRATION.The question..of Empire Settlement and Migrationwas considered by a special Committee under theChairmanship of &quot;the Secretary of State for the Colonies,and the following.

The Conference had before them the draft of. a despatchprepared in accordance with the instructions of tho PrimeMinister, addressed to the Government of the United..States ofAmerica on the subject of the proposed conversation on Pacificquestions to precede the conference on Disarmament at Washington(Soe Paprr 5, 46 ).Discussion centred largely on the place at which the con-versation should take place.   It was strongly urged that, asthe main objecst of the conversation would be to induce theUnited States of America to make a concession and to abandonher intention to build a great Navy, It would be inexpedient to insist on the conversation being held in London, and that better results would certainly be obtained If it were held inAmerica.Various alternative localities were suggested includingHonolulu, Havana, Bar Harbour and Portsmouth,Maine.The suggestion was made that, in the limited! time avail-able, little result was likely to be attained unless both theagenda and the number of Powers represented were strictly limited, and that this might be practicable if the subjects ofdiscussion were limited to the substitution of some kind,oftripartite agreement for the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.The Conference agreed -That the draft despatch should be circulatedto the Prime Ministers of the Dominions andthe representatives of India.2.

St. Quintin Hill, Acting Secretary to the Committee.,Mr. R. B. Howorth, Assistant Secretary, Cabinet.industrial assurance Bill.1. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP. 3152) covering a draft Bill on industrial assurance The Memorandum was accompanied by a note by theChief Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Government Actuaryand by a copyof the Report of Lord Parmoor&apos;s Committee (Cmd. 614).It was explained to the Committee that the Bill had been drafted in order to remedy the abuses in industrial assurance which hadbeen pointed out on pages 1-8 of the Parmoor Committee&apos;s Report,and it followed closely the recommendations of that Committee asset out on pages 8-15 of the Report.The opinion was expressed that, in view of the complicated andtechnical nature of the Bill, the only question which the committee could conveniently discuss was the advisability of introducing the Billthis session. This step had been suggested by the Home secretary with a view to affording opportunity for discussion of the Bill and forthe expression of the views of those interested, so that the Govern-ment might have the advantage of considering any criticisms.The Home Secretary explained that his view was no longer, as stated in his Memorandum, that a second reading should be given to[6691]
the Bill in the House of Lords, but that the Bill should be merelyintroduced and printed. This would be the simplest way to bring itto public notice. Further discussion with the companies would beimpossible unless the Bill were printed, as the companies had askedto see the actual provisions. The agents had so far refrained from making any criticisms, no doubt because they wished to awaitpublication of the Bill.&apos; - Reference was made to the probable political effect of the Billsome of the provisions of which would be opposed by insurance agents and others, who benefited by the present system of industrial assurance, though in labour circles there would be a substantial measure of support. It was questioned whether it would be wise to introduce such a contentious measure so long before it was intended to pass it into law. Particular reference was made to theprovision limiting expenses as being likely to arouse opposition.It was urged that, if the Bill were to be published this session,it would be desirable that a debate should take place in the House ofLords in order that the Government might have an opportunityof explaining that the Bill had been introduced merely for thepurpose of evoking the comments of those interested, and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster informed the Committee that,if the Committee expressed a preference for a debate in the House ofLords, he would consult the Chief Whip as to whether it would bepossible to arrange time for the debate.The Committee were informed that the Ministry of Labour had stated that a detailed examination of the measure might reveal apossibility of their Employment Department being interested in it.The Committee agreed  ;(1.) That, on the assumption that the Ministry of Labour raisedno objection,* the Industrial Assurance Bill (CP. 3152)should be introduced in the House of Lords this Session,and that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancastershould be invited to consult the Chief Whip as towhether it would be possible to arrange for a debate onthe Hill in that House, since, in the Committee&apos;s opinion,*:    such a debate would be desirable.(2.) That various modifications of a minor character which theTreasury desired to introduce into the Bill should bediscussed between the Treasury and the Home Office,and that the Home Office should ascertain whether infact the Ministry of Labour were interested in the Bill.Public Works 2. The / Committee had before them a note by the FinancialLoans Bjtll. Secretary to the Treasury covering a draft of the Public works loans Bill (CP. -3163) The Committee were informed that thiswas an annual Bill and had been drafted in the same form as theAct of the previous year. It gave power to the National DebtCommissioners to issue up to a certain amount money for the purposeof local loans. It also empowered the Treasury to write off assetson the local loans fund, and to remit the arrears of the principal and interest in respect of the Eyemouth Harbour Loan.The Committee were informed that of the sum of 40,000,OOOAwhich was authorised by the Bill, one-half was a re-vote of theamount authorised by the Act last year.The Committee agreed That subject to the consent of the Government Whips, thePublic Works Loans Bill should be introduced into Parlia-ment this Session.* Note; The Ministry of Labour have since intimated that they have noobjection to raise.
3. The Committee had before them a note by the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury covering a draft of the Expiring laws continuance Bill (CP. 3148), together with a memorandum by theHome Secretary suggesting that the Workmen&apos;s Compensation(War Addition) Acts, 1917 and 1919 (CP. 3169), should be includedin the schedule to the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.The Home Secretary explained that the Workmen&apos;s Compen-sation (War Addition) Acts, 1917 and 1919, were agreed measureswith the employers, but negotiations had not yet been completedwith the Mining Association and the Railway Companies&apos; Association.It was hoped that they would be completed very shortly. No-opposition in the House of Commons was anticipated to theinclusion of these Acts in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.The extension of the Acts was necessary as they would lapse nextFebruary, and as they had been originally passed to meet in some measure the rise in the cost of living, which had continued longer than was anticipated when the Acts became law.The Third Parliamentary Counsel pointed out that this was thefirst occasion upon which an Act whose duration depended upon thecontinuance of the war has been included in the Expiring laws continuance Bill, but the Committee were of opinion that its inclusion was justified on the ground that the increase in the cost ofliving which led to the passing of the Act in question was still inexistence.The Committee were informed that, as regards the expiring laws Continuance Bill, the Ministry of Labour had sent a message to the effect that they had been advised that it was doubtfulwhether it was possible to continue the operation of section 45 ofthe Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, by inclusion of the section in the schedule to the Bill. In any case the Ministry of Labourdid not desire to continue the operation ot this section.The Committee agreed (1.) That the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill should be intro-duced into Parliament this Session, and that theWorkmen&apos;s Compensation (War Addition) Acts, 1917and 1919, should be included in the schedule to theBill it&apos; the negotiations with the Mining and RailwayCompanies Associations were brought to a successful conclusion.(2.) That the Treasury should take up with the Ministry ofLabour the question of the inclusion in Part IV of theschedule to the Bill&apos; of section 45 of the UnemploymentInsurance Act, 1920.4. The Home Affairs Committee had before them a Memorandum(CP. 3176) by the Minister of Health relative to the situationwhich had arisen in consequence ot the default by the PoplarBorough Council to levy the rates precepted to them by the LondonCounty Council and other authorities.From this Memorandum it appeared that there was littleprobability of the Borough Council reversing their present attitude,that possibly other Borough Councils in London might follow the example of Poplar unless drastic action was taken, and that in theview of the London County Council it was desirable that parliament should forthwith pass a Bill to the effect that where it was represented that a London Borough Council defaults in the exerciseof their statutory functions, there shall be power in the Ministry ofHealth to appoint a Commissioner to exercise the functions of suchdefaulting Council for such time as might be necessary.It was pointed out that in present circumstances it- would beimpossible to pass into law a Bill of this nature during the present
Session ; that such a Bill would in any case be treated as con-controversial and would provide an occasion for discussion of such questions as the equalisation of London rates, &amp;c. On the otherhand the Home Affairs Committee were informed that the LondonCounty Council and the Ministry of Health had both been warnedby their respective legal advisers that under the present law noremedy existed by which a precepting authority could obtain itsmoney if the rating authority defaulted in the matter of levyingthe rate, and also that it was understood that the political extremistsin London were vigorously supporting the attitude of the PoplarBorough Council in the matter. -It was agreed (i.) That the Ministry of Health should take steps forthwith to obtain t&apos;he opinion of the Law Officers and ofMr. Macmorran, K.C., on the question whether any, andif so what, legal remedy could be enforced by theGovernment and/or the London County Councilin the event of the continued default of the PoplarBorough Council ; and(ii.) That this opinion, when obtained, should be submitted tothe Home Affairs Committee with a view to furtherconsideration of the question.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 28, 1921.o
