A certain number oflicensed premises in Carlisle had not yet beon acquired,and it was suggested that the Home Secretary should begiven power to acquire ,compulsorily any licensed premises in the Carlisle area now in private hands.Subject to a satisfactory settlement of the above de-bateable points, the Bill might be regarded as an agreed measure,Ijteles. and The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister wasHonmouth-Shiro,       most anxious to reach a settlement of the Welsh difficulty, and,While willing to accept the Cabinet decision on the matter,wished to suggest that Clause 4 (g) of the Bill should be modified so as in effect to secure that all licensed premises in Wales and Monmouthshire should be closed on Sundaysfbut that Clubs should be allowed to&apos;open on Sundays on thesame conditions as in England,     If, however, the Members forMonmouth dissented from this proposition, it might be necessars&apos;&quot;to follow local ox)inion as indicated by the ParliamentaryRepre se n ta tive s,
It was agreed:-(&amp;) That Clause 4 (g) should bo modified in thomanner suggested by the prime Minister,(b)    That if the Monmouthshire Members raised. .,opposition to this solution, Monmouthshireshould not be included in Wales for thispurpose.[london Hours,   . It was pointed out that the earliest hour foropening licensed premises in London (11 o.m,) would not meet the case of the night wo rite ri     The Attorney Generalexplained that no objection had been raised in the Con-&apos;  ference to this proposal, but he undertook to give furtherconsideration to the question of those licensed premiseswhich, under the existing law, were able to provide for theneeds of night workers in markets, etca     There was no intention of altering the present Law in those specialoases.Hotel and After some discussion, in which the view wasRestaurantConcession, emphasised that the provisions of the Bill should not be too inelastic as regards the closing hours of hotels and restaurants, it was agreed -(a)    That Clause 4 (d) should bo modified, on tho113Eevxna\i uj.su.bs  ^   (a;  snouia  ue muu.xxj.au. on  *linos desired by the &quot;Hotel an  RestaurantKeepers1 Association, and(b)    That the Clause should be made applicable notonly to hotels and restaurants but to alllicensed promises whoro bona fide meals were supplied,Strength of Some discussion took place as to the proposalsSpirits.in Clause 9 of the Bill regarding the dilution of spirits,and it- was suggested that some limit should be imposed onthe strength of spirits offered for sale.    It was agreed -That tho Bill should stand as drafted in this respectbut that if necessary the Minister in charge of theBill should offer to insert a provision in Clause 9prohibiting the sale of spirits at a strength higherthan l0o tinder proof.
PART ii of THEBILL.SCOTLAND.The Cabinet then considered Part II of theBill which.provides for the winding-up of theCentral Control Board and the transfer of the State-managed areas in England to the Home Secretary, andIn Scotland to the Secretary for Scotland,Objection was raised to the proposals&apos; inso far as they involved State trading, but it waspointed out that the Conference had unanimously agreed in making this recommendation and that, in any case,it would be necessary to provide for the carrying on;of the State-managed areas during the period immediately following the winding up of the Central Control Board-,As regards the acquisition of the remaining licensed premises in private hands in the Carlisle area, it was strongly represented thatounless and until these parti-cular premises were acquired by the State the CarlisleScheme as a whole, could not be expected to show whollysatisfactory results.It was agreed   -To approve the proposals in Part II of theBill including a provision enabling the HomeSecretary to acquire any licensed premisescompulsorily in the Carlisle area at presentin private hands.The Lord Advocate informed the Cabinet thatit had been decided to adoptt in the case of weekdays In Scotland, precisely the same arrangements regarding licensed premises and clubs as would obtainin England to maintain Sunday closing and permit Clubsto sell on Sundays during the hours proposed for england.     The result was to place Scotland in the same position as Wales under the Bill...      It would, however be necessary for him to examine further the questionof penalties for breaches of La7 in Scotland,
At the request of the. Lord. Privy seal the Attorney-General undertook to take charge of theBill in the House of Commons.The Cabinet agreed -(1) To approve the Draft Bill subject to the alterations and modifications indicated above.(2) That the Attorney General and Lord Advocatein consultation should finally settle theprovisions of the Bill with a view to its presentation to the House of Commons onWednesday, July 20th.(3) That in introducing the Bill the attorney general should clearly indicate that theGovernment were only prepared to proceed withthe measure on the understanding that itwas treated as non-controversial, and that,in the event of the Bill having to be droppedthe Government proposed that the central control Board should continue in being for afurther period of one year from the officialdate of the termination of the War, and thatthis arrangement would be effected by anOrder in Council..
sfWZ (  2 ) !Ehe.Mjai,s-^er^ai^-oalth asked the direction of thoIOY.        x&quot; Cabinet in regard to the statement -on housing policy whichhe should make in the course of the debate in the House ofCommons on Thursday next and read the following draft statement which he had prepared: -&quot;We can now oall a halt which will enable usto review the whole situation and to study more economical solutions.While the Government has felt itself compelledto limit the operations of a particular housing scheme, it is not its intention to abandon theproblem or in any way to debar itself from furtherdealing with the question.I may say for myself that I am painfully aware ofthe unsatisfactory condition of the whole housingproblem. Minister of Health I am more especiallyconcerned in viewing the situation from the stand-point of national Health and the necessity ofdealing with evils which have been only too longprevailing.still     The key to much of the improvement of public&quot;heaitn/lies in better housing conditions.I should be entirely unfaithful to the trustimposed upon me and unworthy of the responsibleposition which I hold if I did not emphaticallysay that in my opinion it is impossible for any government to relieve itself of all responsibility in regard to this vital national problem. Thisis also the view of the Government.&quot;The Cabinet were impressed with the undosirability(a) of stimulating new hopes of fresh Government schemesbeing introduced in the immediate future and (b) ofsaying smythlng which would discourage private efforts :to mitigate the housing shortage.     The Cabinet were reminded, on the other hand, of the disappointment which prevailed in the constituencies at the suspension of thehousing programme, and it was suggested that somealleviation might be given by the removal of restrictivebuilding byelaws.The Minister of Health undertook to redraft his -statement in the light of the discussion; toexamine how far he could deal with the modificationof the byelaws; and to prepare &apos;briefs-&apos; forThursday1s debate for the Prime Minister and theLord Privy Seal. \        ; .-.&apos; /

With reference to H.A.C. 88, Minute 1, the Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the Home Secretary,C.P.-2928, relating to certain matters on the agenda of the Inter-national Labour Conference to be held in the autumn.(A.)-The Use of White Lead in Paint.The Committee had before them the following documents: Memorandum by the Office of Works, C.P.-2928 A.Memorandum bv the Home Secretary, C.P.-2928 B.Memorandum by the Board of Trade, O.P.-2928 0.Reports of two Home Office Committees, C.P.-2928 D andC.P.-21I28E.[6437]b
The Chairman pointed out that the Memorandum by the 0ffic3of Works confirmed the statement made at the previous meeting onbehalf of the Office of Works. That Department had altered theviews expressed in evidence before the. Home Office Committees,and were of opinion that white lead was more durable than leadlesssubstitutes and did not cause the disease amongst painters commonlyattribxited to it, except through the rubbing down of dry paint.The opinion of Sir Kenneth Goadby, who had made comparativetests upon men using leadless paint and also upon men employed inthe manufacture of white lead, was that symptoms of lead poisoningare due to turpentine, which is used even more in leadless paintthan in white lead.In the new Memorandum submitted by the Home Secretary,C.P.-292.S B, it was stated that the Home Office medical expertadvised that there was no evidence that turpentine causes symptomslike those of lead paralysis or chronic lead poisoning.The Home Secretary in view of the attitude now adopted by theOffice of Works, recommended that the Government in replying tothe International Labour Office questionnaire should not commit themselves, and should state that in consequence of further evidencerecently submitted, the British Government are not in a position toexpress a decided opinion until further enquiry has been made, thatthe Home Office should appoint a fresh Committee to investigate theOffice of Works experience, and that the British delegates at theConference should remain neutral, but that if there is a majority in favour of regulations rather than prohibition, they should do their best to make these as effective and practicable as possible.The Board of Trade had put in a Memorandum. C.P.-2928 C,giving statistics on the amount of lead production and the importanceof the trade : pre-Avar capital in the paint&apos; and varnish trade,8 millions ; pre-war annual value of paint produced, 4 millions, ofwhich approximately 60 per cent, was exported. They pointed outthat as the fundamental base of British-made paint is white lead, ifthe use of white lead is prohibited, not only will this valuable exporttrade he lost, but our own home consumption of paint will have tobe supplied from abroad.The Committee were informed that in the view of the HomeOffice it was not possible to accept the opinions now expressed bythe Office of Works or those of Sir Kenneth Goadby without thorough examination, and that there was still strong evidence that the originalview was correct. If there were any fresh evidence it should be investigated, particularly on the point whether the alleged lack ofdurability of leadless paint was not due to bad material suppliedduring the war. The change of view of the Office of Works hadbeen somewhat abrupt, and was directly contrary to the findings ofthe two Home Office Committees.It was pointed out on behalf of the Office of Works that theview they now held was reached as a result of an investigationthey had made arising out of the demand of the Treasury that thecost of maintenance should be cut down to an absolute minimum.On enquiring into possible reductions it was found that it wouldnot be possible to effect the economies desired if the policy of usingonly leadless paint was continued owing to its shorter durability ascompared with lead paint.It was suggested that in any fresh enquiry undertaken, full regard should be had to the therapeutic and physiological aspectsof the question.The Committee agreed (1.) That the Government should reply to the [questionnaireof the International Labour Office by referring to therecommendations in the reports of the two Committees,but should state that quite recently further evidence hasbeen submitted as to the results of the use of leadless
\CO; g .,r paints  which  appears  to throw some doubt on theconclusions arrived at, and that, until this evidence hasbeen carefully examined, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentregret they are not in a position to express any decidedopinion as between prohibition and regulation.(2.) That the Home Office should appoint a fresh Committee to investigate the observations made by the Office of Works,and that the terms of reference and composition of - theCommittee should be submitted to the Home AffairsCommittee for approval.(3.) That, pending the report of such Committee, the british delegates at the International Labour Conference shouldnot commit themselves to prohibition, but if there were a majority in favour of the regulation of the use of whitelead in paint instead of prohibition, they should do their best to make such regulation as effective and practicableas possible and should vote for them.&quot;Weekly Eest Day.     (B.) Weekly Rest Day.The Committee had before them a Memorandum by the Ministerof Labour, O.P.-2969, and a further Memorandum in reply by theHonie Secretary, OP.-3035. The Home Secretary in his originalMemorandum, C.P.-2928, had proposed that the British Govern-ment should be prepared to accept an international conventionestablishing the principle of the weekly rest day in industrial undertakings, excluding commercial undertakings and the mercantileand fishing services. He did not apprehend any difficulty in passing legislation so far as industrial undertakings are affected,the principle being already firmly established in this country. Inthe case of commercial undertakings he recommended that theBritish representative should vote only for a recommendation at theConference,-which would open the matter up for discussion.In the Memorandum by the Minister of Labour, C.P.-2969, itwas suggested that the Government should not commit themselvesto legislation involving additional interference by the State in industrial relations, and that custom had already achieved in thiscountry all that is required. It was recommended that the Govern-ment should accept a recommendation from the International LabourConference on the principle of a weekly rest day, on the under-standing that that does not necessarily imply legislation.It was stated on behalf of the Ministry of Labour that, onreviewing - the arguments in favour of the proposal to accept aconvention involving legislation in the case of industrial under-takings, it appeared that two main considerations arose : the interestof the British working classes and the interest of the InternationalLabour movement. In so far as concerned the first, there was nodemand for legislation in this country. The principle of a weeklyrest day was fully established by custom, and to attempt to pass legislation of a compulsory character would produce serious com-plications and involve further State interference in the regulation of hours. Broadly speaking, it was not the practice of the Ministry ofLabour to advocate legislation of this character, except in response to a clear demand. On the international aspects of the question, itwas felt that we might find ourselves committed to legislation, while at the same time it would be exceedingly difficult to persuade theFrench and Belgian nations to change the whole of their attitudetowards Simday observance ; and if, indeed, legislation were passed in those countries, it would not be observed.The attention of the Committee was drawn to certain respects in which the present procedure, adopted at the. meetings of theInternational Labour Conference, was unsatisfactory. a conventiondrawn up at the International Conference and agreed to by wayof compromise between conflicting national proposals was not&quot;   &apos; [6437] . B2
necessarily suitable to the arrangements of individual countries,.)They were running the risk either of having to accept, withoutamendment, a rigid convention adopted by the International LabourConference or to refuse to ratify. Unqualified acceptance amountedin substance to a derogation from the legislative sovereignty ofParliament, and sooner or later strong objection would be taken inthe House of Commons. The recent refusal of the British Govern-ment to ratify the Eight-hours&apos; Convention was cited by way ofillustration. It was a question for consideration whether the Inter-national Labour movement would not be better served by adoptingrecommendations merely, rather than rigid and unelastic conven-tions. Recommendations would not bind the various countries to legislation, and the actual proposals recommended could be modified to suit individual national needs. It was pointed out, on the otherhand, that while much of the work of the International LabourConference could be done by recommendations only, it was desirableto have conventions on a few subjects on which there was generalagreement, if only to reassure the representatives of labour at theConference that there would be immediate and fruitful results fromtheir work.The Committee were informed that several other countriesbesides Great Britain had passed legislation to give effect to the conventions agreed on at the Washington Conference. For example,Japan had adopted various industrial reforms which would tend tolevel up the costs of production in that country with those in GreatBritain, and reduce the severe competition from which we had suffered in the past. On the other hand it was pointed out that america was our chief competitor and was not bound by the pro-ceedings of the International Labour Conference.While it was agreed that Great Britain could not persist in refusing a convention on the weekly rest day merely on the groundthat the needs of the case were already satisfied in this country by long established custom, it was pointed out that the position wouldbe much worse if the British delegates were to agree to a convention which the British Government subsequently refused to ratify, as inthe case of the eight-hours&apos; day convention.The opinion was generally held that in future the british delegates must be fully equipped with instructions as &quot;to policywhich had had the deliberate approval of the Departments con-cerned and of the Cabinet, and that they must be careful not to commit the Government in any way beyond the policy agreed on inadvance.The Committee agreed ]. That the International Labour Office should be informed thatthe British Government approved the principle of the weekly rest day, and were prepared at least to support a recommendation of the International Labour Conferenceon the subject. They might also be able to support aconvention so far as industrial undertakings were con-cerned, but this would depend on the nature of thelegislation that would be involved, and the Governmentwere considering this further.(2.) That, before the British Government is committed tosupporting a convention,&apos;the Home Office, in conjunctionwith the Ministry of Labour, should prepare a draft Billon the subject of the weekly rest day for submission tothe Cnbinet, to form the basis of a convention to whichthe British delegates might be authorised to agree if theCabinet so directed.(&apos;-&apos;.) That in future the instructions to the British repre-sentatives at the meetings of the International LabourConference should be drawn up in , advance by theDepartments concerned, in consultation with and through
... the International Labour Committee, and submitted forthe approval of the Cabinet, and that the British delegates should not be authorised to commit the British Govern-ment beyond the policy agreed on in advance.Anthrax. (C). Anthrax.The Home Affairs Committee agreed That the International Labour Office should be informed thatthe British Government were prepared to support an&apos; international convention on the compulsory disinfection of wool infected with anthrax.Representation 2. The Committee had under consideration a memorandum by of the People Bill, the Home Secretary (C.P.-3002), covering a draft of a Bill to amend1921. the Representation of the People Acts, 1916-20, with respect tointerruption of residence during the qualifying period.The object of the Bill is to exclude the possibility of residencefor the purpose of electoral registration being held to be interrupted by absence in conditions which preclude the possibility of return,e.g.-, in the case of territorial training, the Defence Force, the mercantile marine, &amp;c. The Bill is intended to replace &quot; the electoral Disability Act, 1891,&quot; which was repealed by &quot; the representation of the People Act, 1918.&quot;The immediate occasion for the Bill, arose from the circum-stance that reservists and members of the Defence Force dischargedbefore the loth June would be unable to secure registration, because etheir period of residence was broken, and yet they were not qualifiedas military voters, because they were not on that date &quot; persons whoare serving.&quot;The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill, and to authorise the Home Secretaryto introduce it in the House of Commons.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 14, 1921.

AReduction of 1. With reference to Cabinet 52 (21), conclusion 7, the Home OlNational Affairs Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the present^osed^ar Minister of Pensions (C.P.-3058) asking for authority to introduce aPensions Bil)ri9-&apos;l during the present session to effect certain changes in. theadministration.The Minister of Pensions proposed (1.) (a.) To amend the War Pensions Acts so as to enable himto take under his direct control the work of the local war Pensions Committees, which now expended at least20,000,OOOL of public money per annum, in particularhJ- . . .   :.(i.) Limiting the administrative powers of LocalCommittees to the functions which theywere originally set up by Parliament to perform, viz., the giving of discretionaryassistance in cases of hardship out of voluntaryfunds or on behalf of the Special GrantsCommittee ; while, at the same time,(ii.) Constituting them bodies to hear and make representations to the Ministry in regard to cases which, from local knowledge, they may consider not to have been adequately dealtwith by the regional offices of the Ministry.(b.) To reorganise the local areas of administration so as toreduce the number of these areas and of the LocalCommittees to one-third of their present number, and totake into the direct employ of the Ministry officers whowere found essential for carrying on the local work ofthe Pensions Ministry.(2.) To take power to make a final award of pensions withfinality of assessment as against both the man and theState in the case of all men who are still on temporarypension four years after their discharge, subject to usualright of appeal to a Medical Appeal Board within oneyear. There is reason to believe that final awards onthese lines would be acceptable to ex-service men and.would produce substantial saving in the cost of medicalboards, staff and pensions. If seriously pressed in theHouse of Commons, an appeal to an independent tribunalmight be inserted in the Bill.(3.) To limit the time for fresh claims for pensions from disabledmen to seven years from the date of the man&apos;s disabilityor demobilisation or the end of the war, whichever isearlier, thus putting an end to the right of those disabledin the late war under Article 9 of the present warrantsto put forward at any future time claims on the ground of disability sustained or aggravated by war service.(4.) The following minor amendments to the War Pensions&apos;       .. Act :  . ,(a.) Power to commute pensions of seamen on the.same lines as already apply to pensions ofsoldiers ;(b.) Power to assume the custody of the orphanchild of an officer or man killed in the war,who may have been adopted by and be underthe control of a Board of Guardians;&apos;(c.) Amendment of section S of &quot; The War Pen-sions Act, 1919,&quot; dealing with the rightof appeal to a Pension Appeal Tribunal,including the imposition of a time limit tosuch appeals.
The Minister of Pensions informed the Committee that he hadreceived an assurance from the Government Whips that time forthe Bill would be found this session if, as indicated in his memorandum, the Bill was practically an agreed measure.The proposals were criticised from the point of view that theymight be represented as involving too great centralisation, and also as an attempt on the part of the Government to effect economies atthe expense of the pensioners; this was particularly urged asregards the proposals for granting final pensions, and it wassuggested that in order to meet hard cases it might be desirable forthe Minister of Pensions to retain some dispensing power to increasea &quot; final&quot; pension. On the other hand, it was pointed out that theproposals were based on the unanimous recommendations&quot; of a strongCommittee comprising representatives of all interests affected.That under the arrangements contemplated there would be amplefacilities provided locally for the consideration of cases ; that therewould be no difficulty in demonstrating that the proposals wouldnot operate to the detriment of individual pensioners; that it wouldbe most undesirable for the Minister of Pensions to be given the suggested dispensing power, and that the point was really met bythe fact that before a final pension was granted all circumstances,including the possibility of a pensioner&apos;s condition deteriorating,would be taken into account. As regards the proposed amendmentof section 8 of the Act of 1919, it was explained that the intention was to give a right of appeal to applicants in cases where theMedical Board found no disability, but to impose a time limit of six or twelve months for appeals to the Pension Appeal Tribunal.The general feeling of the Committee was in favour of insertingprovisions in the Bill at the outset giving an appeal to an independent tribunal, rather than that such provisions should be subsequentlyincorporated in the Bill as a result of pressure in the House ofCommons.The Committee agreed To request the Minister of Pensions to expedite the preparationof the draft Bill with a view to its detailed considerationby the Committee at the next meeting to be held onThursday, the 30th June, 1921.2. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-3038) covering a draftof a Bill to regulate the sale of clinical thermometers.It was proposed in the Bill to prohibit the sale of clinicalthermometers unless tested and marked under regulations of theBoard of Trade, as had been required by certain of the regulations under the Defence of the Realm Acts which were brought to anend on the 31st March. The matter had been included in the miscellaneous Provisions Bill of the Ministry of Health thepreceding session, and this particular clause had been carried in committee without opposition. It was felt to be particularlynecessary to make provision against the importation of inaccuratethermometers from abroad. Foreign consignments had been testedat the National Physical Laboratory under the regulations recentlyrepealed and, in some cases, as much as 80 per cent, had been rejected. The Bill involved no charge on the State, the expenses incurred being covered by the fees charged for testing.The Committee agreed To approve the Bill and, subject to the consent of the chief whip, to authorise the President of the Board of Trade tointroduce it in the House of Commons during the present session.
3. With reference to the meeting of a Conference of Minister^held at 10, Downing Street, at 12 noon on the 9th April, 1921, theCommittee had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War (C.P.-3049) relating to the discharge of mensurplus to requirements at Woolwich, from which it appeared thaton the 4th April some 2,000 workmen being surplus, discharges wereordered at the rate of 200 a week, but that in consequence of repre-sentations of certain Members of Parliament, these had been suspended, and eventually, in consequence of serious unemploymentarising out of the coal strike, it had been decided that dischargesshould be suspended indefinitely. At the present time the numberof men available for discharge had increased, and, taking all departments at Woolwich, at least 3,000 could be dispensed withimmediately, and probably a further 3,000 by the 1st April next.It was recommended that dischai&quot;ges should be resumed as fromthe 1st July, and should proceed until further notice at the rate of300 a week.The Financial Secretary to the War Office explained that themen concerned were mostly clerks employed on work in connectionwith Stores, Pay and Records.While it was pointed out that unemployment in the Woolwicharea looked very serious, the Committee felt that that did not justifythe Government in any longer retaining men for whom there wasno work.The Committee agreed That discharges at Woolwich should be resumed at the rate of300 a week; the notice for the first 300 being givenforthwith to take effect on or about the 7th July.4. The Committee had under consideration a joint Memorandum(C.P.-3053) by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the^Secretary for Scotland covering the draft Land Settlement Amend-ment Bill 1921, the purpose of which is to carry into effect decisionsof the Cabinet on the recommendations as to Land Settlement policyin England and Wales made by the Cabinet Committee on LandSettlement.It was suggested that the financial proposals in the Bill fell within the purview of Cabinet 49 (21), Conclusion 5, and possiblyrequired fresh Cabinet sanction. On the other hand, it was urgedthat the Cabinet decision in question did not apply to proposalswhich had received recent specific Cabinet sanction.The Committee generally approved the terms of the draft Bill,and, in particular, agreed that the preference for ex-service men should continue to be given as at present by regulation, and shouldnot be specifically granted by the Bill itself.The Secretary for Scotland informed the Committee that he wasin communication with the Lord Privy Seal on the question of timebeing found for the JtJili this session.The Committee agreed  *&quot;That, subject to the concurrence of the Lord Privy Seal being obtained, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary for Scotland should be authorised to introduce the Bill in the form of the draft attached to C.P.-3053.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 2&apos;A, 1921.

Howorth, Assistant Secretary, Cabinet.Juries (emergency provisions)(Renewal) Bill.1. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C.P.-3085) covering the draft of a Bill to renew section 2 of the Juries (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1920,&apos; bywhich it was provided that in certain county boroughs which have aseparate Commission of Assize the Burgess Roll might be used forthe purpose of jury lists for the year. 1921, with a mark placedagainst the names of those persons who under the Act of 1825 werequalified and liable to serve.The Home Secretary explained that in these boroughs it hadbeen the practice for many years not to prepare jury lists inaccordance with the Act of 1825 but to use the Burgess Roll.   The[6517]
law Officers had now advised that the practice was illegal and thatseparate jury lists should have been prepared. The Juries(Emergency Provisions) Act, 1920, had been passed to legaliseverdicts which had been returned under the old system, and toprovide that for 1921 the Burgess Roll might be used. A general Billrevising the law relating to juries was in preparation and would beintrodirced in Parliament next year. The purpose of the presentmeasure was to prolong the emergency provisions of the Act of1920 for another year.The Committee agreed To approve the Juries (Emergency Provisions) (Renewal) bill and. subject to the approval of the Lord Privy Seal, toauthorise the Home Secretary to arrange for its introduction in the House of Lords during the present session.Trade Board Policy. 2. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum byEates proposed by the Minister of Labour (C.P.-3078), upon an application by theGrocery Trade Grocery and Provisions Trade Board under the Trade Boards Acts-Board- for confirmation of a schedule of rates and wages proposed by theBoard and set out in the Appendix to the Memorandum.The Minister of Labour outlined the history of the developmentof Trade Board policy under the Acts of 1909 and 1918. Inconsequence of the policy instituted by his predecessor of extending the Trade Board system to the distributive trades, a Board for thegrocery trade had been set up in August 1920. During the ensuingten months nothing operative had been accomplished. The board had proposed a scale of rates in October 1920. Objection hadbeen taken to the rates in rural areas and smaller county towns,and at the instance of the employers the rates proposed had been referred back to the Board for reconsideration, but it had been impossible to secure agreement, and the Board, by a majorityconsisting of the votes of the workers&apos; representatives and theappointed members, reaffirmed the rates originally fixed. It was important to bear in mind that the rates had been originally fixed in 1920 when the cost of living index figure was 176 as comparedwith 119 for June 1921. The Board consisted of thirty-ninerepresentatives of employers and employed respectively and five members appointed by the Ministry of Labour, who in this caseconsisted of three professors of economics, one barrister and a lady.The rates were not unsatisfactory, except from the point of view ofthe shopkeepers in the smaller county towns and in villages. Onthe other hand, the workers&apos; representatives pressed the point ofview that the workers should not be prejudiced by the fact thatduring the delay in giving effect to the findings of the Board thecost of living had fallen, and that it would be equitable to compensate the workers now for the lower wages received when thecost, of living was high. At the same rime the Board were prepared&quot; immediately to reconsider the rates in the light of the fall in thecost of living, but no alteration was possible for at least threemonths even if general agreement could be secured, and in all probability fresh rates could not be brought into force for anothersix months. On the other hand the smaller employers stronglyprotested that the fixing of minimum wages at the rates proposed would ruin their business in small towns. If the order wereconfirmed there would be general failure to comply with it amongstsmall shopkeepers, and the Ministry of Labour would be understatutory obligation to undertake prosecutions all over the country.There were two alternative policies : (1.) To confirm the award of the Trade Board and suggest animmediate revision of the scale in the light of the fall in- the cost of living.(2.) To refuse to confirm and suggest the preparation of a revised scale.
The Committee, after discussing the matter, were of opinionthat, having regard to the wording of section 4 (2) of the trade board Act, 1918*- .The Minister of Labour had no discretion,&quot; and was legallyobliged to confirm the order made by the Board in thecircumstances set out above. In view, however, of thepolitical effect which the confirmation of the order wouldhave, the Committee agreed that the matter should bereferred to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 29, 1921.* TRADE BOARDS ACT, 1918.Section 4 (2).The Minister on receipt of a notification under this section with respect to any matter shall forthwith take the matter into his consideration, and, unless he thinks itnecessary to refer the matter back to the Trade Board for reconsideration, shall, assoon as may be, make an order confirming the rate, or the cancellation or variation, asthe case may be. &apos;    *

the proposed Declaration would put a time limit on regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act. It was suggested that theHome Office as the Department principally concerned should ascertain by means of a circular the extent to which other Depart-ments would be affected by the proposed Declaration.The Committee were informed, however, that it was believedthat a circular had been issued by the Treasury on the 25th June.The attention of the Committee was drawn to the Avork done bythe Committee under Lord Cave, which resulted in &quot; The WarRegulations Continuance Act, 1920.&quot; It was suggested that theminutes of these Committees should contain valuable information on this subject.In the absence of the representative of the Treasury it was notpossible to ascertain what, if any, steps had been taken to elicit theviews of interested Departments, and the Committee accordinglyagreed (1.) That the consideration of the matter should be postponed until the next meeting.(2.) That, in the meantime, the nature of the action, if any,taken by the Treasury should be ascertained and com-municated to the Committee.(3.) That, the Secretary should submit to the Chairman theproceedings of the Committee under Lord Cave relatingto the Defence of the Realm Regulations.War pensions act, 1920 (service in Ireland).3.

The Committee had under consideration a MemorandumFreshwater by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries covering the draft of aFisheries Bill. gill to consolidate and amend enactments relating to Salmon and fresh Water Fisheries in England and Wales (C.P.-3057). It was stated in the Memorandum that there was an insistent demanddating from before the war for a revision of legislation relating toFisheries. A Bill had been promised in the preceding Session, andthere had been considerable criticism of the failure to introduceone. The Bill involved no expenditure from the Exchequer or fromthe rates. It was not proposed to pass it during the current session.The approval of the Home Affairs Committee was asked for its introduction in Parliament in order that the text might be madeavailable for criticism by those interested. It could then bere-introduced early in the following Session with such amendments as might appear desirable. The terms of the Bill had been acceptedby all Departments concerned.The Home Affairs Committee agreed To approve the introduction of the Salmon and Fresh WaterFisheries Bill in Parliament for the purpose of invitingpublic discussion of the proposals.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 30, 1921.[p.t.o.

Alteration of theTitles of theTerritorial Forceand SpecialEeserve.2.  The Committee had before them a Memorandum  by the*/Secretary of State for War, covering a draft Bill providing for the alteration of the titles of the Territorial Force and Special Reserve(CP. 3096).The draft Bill had been prepared in order to yive effect to decisions of the Secretary of State for War that the titles of theTerritorial Force and Special Reserve should be changed to &quot; Terri-torial Army &quot; and &quot; Militia &quot; respectively. Wide publicity had beengiven to these intended changes, which were believed to be generallypopular and likely to further recruiting. The Bill also provided forthe repeal of Acts relating to the old Militia Force and the elimination of references to it in Statutes. The Yeomanry Acts and references to the Yeomanry would also be repealed by the Bill. No difficulty was anticipated in passing the present Bill, which was not likely tobe controversial.Attention was called to the desirability of obtaining the King&apos;ssanction to these changes, and the Committee were informed that,although this had not yet been done, the War Office would bring thematter to the notice of His Majesty.The Committee agreed To approve the introduction of the Territorial Army and MilitiaBill (CP. 3096), subject to the assent of the Lord privy seal and the Government Whips, and on the understandingthat the King&apos;s consent would be obtained to the changes proposed by the Bill.Declaration of the 3. With reference to Home Affairs Committee, 92, Conclusion 2,Termination of the Committee had before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor of:!    &apos;  1 the Exchequer (CP. 3081) and a Memorandum by the Minister ofPensions (CP. 3032) on the desirability of declaring the terminationof the war at an early date.At their meeting on the 30th June the Committee &apos; had beeninformed that the Treasury had circularised Departments in order toascertain the extent to which the work of Departments would beaffected by the proposed declaration. The Committee had accordinglypostponed consideration of the matter until the replies of Depart-ments were received.The Committee were informed that replies had so far beenreceived from the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, the Foreign Office,the Home Office, and the Ministry of Pensions, but that the majorityof Departments had not yet replied.The attention of the Committee was drawn to the effect on thework of the Liquor Control Board of a declaration of the terminationof the war being made before the passage into law of the Liquor Bill,and the opinion was expressed generally that the whole question ofthe effect of such a declaration on the work of Government Depart-ments was so complicated that no decision could be reached withoutthe fullest consideration.The Committee agreed (1.) To postpone consideration of the matter until a meeting tobe held next week.(2.) In view of the fact that the Committee had already twiceconsidered the matter without being able to come to adecision, owing to absence of full information, to place on record their opinion that the matter was of great urgency, and to request the Treasury to press Depart-ments for immediate replies to the Treasury circular.(3.) To request the Treasury to reconsider the list of Depart-ments which had been circularised with a view to ensuring that it was comprehensive.

With reference to Home Affairs Committee, 92, Conclusion 3,1920 (Service in the Committee had before them Memoranda by the Secretary ofIreland). State for War (Qp   2U7^ and the Ghancelior Qf the Exchequer(CP. 2496) regarding the effect of the application of &quot; The WarPensions Act, 1 920,&quot; to officers and soldiers in Ireland and elsewhere.In his Memorandum of the 13th January, 1921 (CP. 2447), theSecretary of State for War pointed out that on the declaration of the- termination of the war disability benefit would drop to the peacescale. The War Office were of opinion that if the date of thetermination of the war was reached during a state of hostilities inany part of the world, including Ireland, it would not be possiblesuddenly to lower the scale of benefits, and therefore any casualtiesreceived during the continuance of such hostilities should be met bygrants at war rates.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had pointed out in his memorandum of the 24th January, 1921 (CP.-2496), that thedifficulty referred to by the War Office must inevitably have arisen,and there was, therefore, ho particular advantage in postponement.Moreover, if the new scales were not applied to Ireland and other areas where hostilities were in progress, their introduction might be jeopardised. He suggested, however, that, if it was considered that public feeling would be hostile to a reduction at the present time in &apos;the particular case of service in Ireland, it would be sufficient for theCabinet to rule that the higher rates of pension should continue toapply to Ireland for a period of, say, six months after &quot; The WarPensions Act, 1920,&quot; became operative, the matter, then to bere considered. The Treasury would then, under the dispensationwarrant, authorise a grant of flat-rate pensions at the higher rateslaid down in the war warrants, but they would not regard it as necessary to continue &quot; Alternative Pensions.&quot;The opinion was expressed that as this question was a financialone it should be submitted for decision to the Cabinet, and theCommittee agreed That the matter should be referred to the Cabinet, who shouldbe informed that facility existed for meeting the difficultyof casualties occurring in Ireland. At the same time.theCabinet should be informed that, in the opinion of theCommittee, it would be right to make an exception fromthe operation of &quot;The War Pensions Act, !920,&quot; of casulties occurring in Ireland subject to reconsideration&apos;after six months.5. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (CP. 3097) covering a draft Bill, theprincipal provisions of which empowered the Admiralty to allow the partial commutation of certain naval pensions, and to authorisethe payment of pensions in forfeiture. The former proposal was inaccordance with the recommendations of the Jerram Committee,and the Government were pledged to give effect to it. The latterproposal brought pensions administered by the Admiralty into line with those administered by the Ministry of Pensions. The bill was stated to be non-contentious and its financial considerationsAdmiraltyPensions Bill.
insignificant.   It had been approved by the Treasury and concurred in by other Departments concerned.The Committee agreed-To approve the introduction in the House of Commons of theAdmiralty Pensions Bill (CP. 3097), subject to the assent of the Lord Privy Seal and the Government Whips.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,July 7, 1921.o
