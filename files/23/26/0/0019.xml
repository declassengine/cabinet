(l) The-Cabinet had a short dd^cuasion in regard to theattitude to be taken up by the British representatives at theforthcoming meeting of the Supreme Council in Paris on thesubject Of the Russian famine^ which will be raised by theFrench and Belgian representatives.Misgivings were expressed as to whether, in View ofthe stringent financial situation, when all classes of thecommunity were being asked to make great sacrifices, theBritish Government would be justified in asking Parliament to vote such a sum as would meet the needs of the situation.In the unavoidable absence of the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord Privy Seal summarised the main features of the financial outlook.   He pointed out that existing taxa-tion must, in present financial and industrial conditions,produce less money than in the past.   Additional taxation was out of the question.   A loan could only be floated for renewingdebt falling due, and then only if it could be convincinglydemonstrated that expenditure was reduced to a minimum.   Con- .sequentiy the utmost difficulty would be met even in dealingwith such essentials as unemployment relief.    It was imperative that, if money were required, Parliament should be asked to vote it before prorogation.   But, in the conditions outlined above, this would be very difficult.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the Bolsheviksmight possess sufficient gold to pay for all the food that could be imported;   that, even if gold was not available, there might be other resources which might be hypothecated to the raising of a loan;    that possibly it was facilities ratherthen money that was required;   that, even though the Sovietat present ruled in Russia, the famine districts wea?e thosewhich had longest resisted the Bolsheviks;   that when Bolshev-ism had disappeared,    the Russian people would remain,, andit would be a wise policy to give so emotional a peoplereason for gratitude;    that, even if money were required, the raising of a great voluntary fund might be more effective.-1-
than Government assistance, and that possibly the best manner in which the Government could help would be creating a favourable atmosphere for (?) such a fund.

A suggestion, which met with such support, was that Roumania, where a good harvest was reported, should be permitted to pay a part of her debt to this oountry bysending grain to Russia.

The view was strongly pressed that in any event Government funds should not he put at tho disposal of the Bolshevist Government, which had flagrantly broken the Trade Agreement and had given so many examples of bad faith.

The general trend of the discussion was to the effect that, while the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon should have reasonable latitude to negotiate, it was undesirable, in existing financial conditions, to promise Government funds, but that there was no objection to giving facillties in return for payment, or to the raising of a voluntary fund, or to the proposal to allow Roumania to send wheat to Russia in discharge of her debt, provided that the administration of any form of relief to be provided by this country, whether in one of the above forms or in any other, should be British.

AUTUMN (?)INISTERIAL CAMPAIGN.

(2) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chief Whips drawing attention to the necessity of a systematic Ministerial campaign of public meetings to be held in all the great industrial centres and ether parts of the, country during the Autumn (Paper C.P. 3191).

Subject to Cabinet approval, it was suggested that each Minister should undertake to address four meetings outside his own constituency, in order that a systematic scheme might be drawn up at once of Ministerial meetings throughout the country, and the middle of October was sug-


gested as a suitable date for the beginning of the campaign.

The Cabinet approved the appeal of the Government Whips, and authorised them to state that members of the Cabinet were prepared to take their share in the campaign.

The Lord Privy Seal undertook to arrange with the Government Whips that they should consult the convenience of members of the Cabinet in regard to the time and place of the four meetings outside their own Constituencies to be addressed by members of the cabinets and give them ample notice of all arrangements.

? OF ? (PRICES DESCRIPTIONS).

(3) With reference to Cabinet 59 (21), Conclusion 1, the Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the President of the Board of Trade (paper C.P.-3125) and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-3161) recommending the revocation of the Orders affecting the control of liquor made tinder tho Ministry of Food Continuance Act, on the ground that the original reasons for the restrictions had long lost their validity and that de-control would be to the advantage of the revenue and enable certain administrative economies to be made.

The Cabinet agreed -

That the  Orders controlling the prices, quality and description of liquor should be revoked as from the late of the date of entry into force of the new Licensing Act.

EMPLOYMENT.

? time in ? Majesty&apos;s ?.

(4) With reference to cabinet 80 (20), Conclusion 8, section (a), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper No.-3167) recounting the exporienoe which had resulted from the decision of the Cabinet on January 23, 1921, to mitigate unemployment by working "short time" in His Majesty&apos;a Dockyards and other Admiralty establishments. By the adoption of "short time" it had been possible to engage about 7,500 

men for temporary employment during the first three months of 1921. Most of the work on which these casual 

entrants
could economically be employed had now came to an end, the number still retained being about 2,700, and as "short time" had been found to be prejudidial to efficiency and economy on several grounds it was important to get back to normal working hours and conditions as possible. It was proposed to increase the "short time" hours from 40 to 48 hours per week during the coming month, with a view to reverting to full time (47 hours a week) later in the financial year.

It was explained by Ihe First Lord that the reversion to normal hours would enable discharges of temporary men to be continued, and that the proposals would involve no increase in wage expenditure beyond that provided for in the Navy Estimates for the current financial year.

The Cabinet agreed -

To sanction the restoration of normal hours in stages, as proposed by the Admiralty.

? IRISH ?.

(5) With reference to Cabinet 63 (81), Conclusion 4,the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the secretary of state for War dealing with a number of matters whioh would require immediate oonsideratlon should the present negotiations with the Sinn Fein leaders break down(Paper C.P.-3178).

In the course of the discussion it was pointed out that the consideration of the measures indicated by the Secretary of State for War was premature, and that in any case ample notice for their consideration would be afforded before the termination of the truce. Further, there were measures other than those enumerated in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War upon which it would be desirable to obtain the views of the cabinet at a later stage.

The Cabinet agreed:-

To postpone the consideration of the Memorandum by the Seoretary of State for War to a later date.

Juvenile Employment Inquiry.To the Bight HonourableDavid Lloyd George, ST.P.,Prime Minister.Sir,1.       I have the honour to present a report on my inquiry into-certain.questions relating to the choice of Employment for Juveniles in England and.Wales.2. I undertook the inquiry at the request of theSecretary of State for India (to whom the matter hadbeen referred by the Cabinet) and with the concurrence ofthe Minister of Labour and the President of the Boara ofEducation.     Associated with me as assessors have been -Sir Walter Kinhear, representing His Majesty&apos;s Treasury,Mr. BoK. Chambers, representing the Board of education and Mr.A.Paterson, representing the Ministry of Labour.3. The terms of my reference ars&quot;To inquire into the difficulties which have arisen in&apos; giving effect to the Joint Memorandumof the Presidents of the Board of Trade and Boardof Education of 3i?d January 1911 relating to theadministration of the labour Exchanges.Act (1909) andthe Education (Choice of Employment) Act 1910, andto make recommendations as to the arrangements whichshould be made under these Acts for advising and        ; -assisting young persons in choosing and obtainingsuitable employment, regard being had to theEducation Act 1918 and the Unemployment InsuranceAct 1920.&quot;4. In the course&apos; of the inquiry I have examined26 witnesses.     These included officers both of theMinistry of Labour and the Beard of Education;representatives of Local Education Authorities and oftheir officials and the national Union of Teachers;
Illand members of various Juvenile Advisory &quot;Committees-of theMinistry; among whom ware representatives both ofemployers and employed.       In addition several memorandahave been laid before me.5.        The position as regards choice of employment mayba summarised thusOver 300,000 boys and girls leave the public elementary schools in England and Wales each year and ofthese a large and increasing number seek help from the bodies established to deal with the choice of employment for juveniles.    These bodies are(e)    Juvenile Advisory:Committees appointed and maintained financially by the Ministry oflabours      These Committees are established in130 areas.(b)    Choice of Employment Committees acting asSub-Committees of local Education authorities under the Education (Choice of Employment)Act 1910.     These Committees are. established in 100 areas.    They are maintained by theAuthorities and the Board of Education and the Ministry of Jabour bears certain expenses in respect of work assigned to thorn by theSchemes of co-operation.6; In 1911 a Memorandum was issued signed bythe Presidents of the Board of Education and Boardox IVada which attempted to secure co-operationbetween the interested parties and to lay downprinciples of administration.     That Memorandumlaid down the principle that     &quot;tho employment ofjuveniles should be primarily considered from the pointof view of their educational interests and permanent careers rather than from thot of their
immediate earning capacities&quot;.   The Memorandum furtherurged that Local Education Authorities should undertake the responsibility offered by the Choice of EmploymentAct and indicated lines of co-operation between them andthe Ministry of Labour.   Unfortunately, however, theadministrative arrangements contemplated in the memorandum in respect of co-operation have proved to be, in important respects, -unworkable and the existence of dualresponsibility has led to conflicts between certain LocalEducation Authorities and the Ministry of Labour whichhave seriously jeopardised the success of this important service.   The interests involved are bothindustrial and educational and it has been suggested thatthe two types of Committee approach the matter from different points of view.    Heir6over;, certain localauthorities are averse from sharing responsibility with aGovernment Department, other than that by which theyare normally supervised.7,    In these circumstances I am clear that ifthe difficulties inherent in the present position areto be removed the methods of co-operation laid downin the Memorandum of 1911 must be abandoned; but I agreewith the principle laid down in that Memorandum withreference to the employment of juveniles and I considerthat Education Authorities should be urged to take xiptheir power s under the Choice of Employment Act.8.     In arriving at my recommendations as to future policy I have had regard to two main considerations:-(a)    Juveniles of 14 to 18 years are in a periodmidway between the educational life of the child and the industrial or commerciallife of the adult.     They occupy adebaleable ground in which both educational
and industrial interests  are present &quot;butneither is paramount.    The. two parties claimthis ground as their own;  trio educationistspoint to their intimate -knowledge of thecharacter&apos;, capacity and physical condition ofthe juvenile, the industrialists (if I may sostyle them) to the importance of wide knowledgof industrial conditions.    The extremeeducationists vrould deny access to theschool and extreme Industrialists to theworkshop unless their respective claims to-control are upheldi    Tiie difficulties have largely arisen &quot;because in many cases the zealof the contending parties is too great to admiof compromise,(b)     For practical purposes the choice in each area as regards administration lies between a system of central administration by theMinistry of Labour acting in co-operationwith Local Education authorities and a systemof local admini strati on by -the Authorities,SL\pervised like other parts of their administration by the Board of Education andreinforced by help from the Ministry of labour to make either system universal would require legislation Which would undoubtedly provecontentious; the former would mean the repeal of the Choice of Employment ,.&apos;.ct, the latterthe amendment of that **ct so as to make itobligatory instead of permissive,9..     I may say that on the evidence put before meam convinced that there is no inherent reason whyther a Juvenile Employment- Committee of the Local
Education Authority or a Juvenile Advisory Committee ofthe Ministry of Labour should not perform the work with complete efficiency.Indeed I have been much impressed by what I havelearned of the excellent work done by Juvenile AdvisoryCommittees of the Ministry of Labour in co-operationwith Local Education Authorities.      Even in these oases,however, the potentiality of friction exists and shouldbe eliminated. *10.     The difficulties which have arisen have been mainly local and therefore the remedy should be local.I propose then that full responsibility and control should be offered in the first instance to the localauthority as the best method of removing the primecause of the difficulty.     This full responsibility andoontrol would involve the assumption by the authorities of the executive and financial responsibilities whichat present fall to the Ministry of Labour under co-operative schemes.       Moreover, I feel bound to take intoaccount the fact that while the Choice of Employment Actrelates expressly to Juveniles the Labour Exchanges Actdoes not, and that when the Labour Exchanges Bill was before Parliament the Minister in charge, Mr,Churchill,said;&quot; I would like to say that it is very necessary indealing with young people that educational interestsshould predominate over any commercial interests.      Wehave no intention whatever of placing upon the LabourExohanges the prime work of placing young people inemployment.       That must, be regarded much more from the educational point of view than from the purely industrialpoint of view.&quot;11.     Accordingly, I have the honour to suggest thatall Local Education Authorities for Higher Educationexcept those already possessing approved Schemes should
&quot;be invited to submit to the Board proposals for theexercise of full powers under the Choice of EmploymentAct 1910 and that those who have already adopted theAct should he given the option of discontinuing theexercise of their powers or of exercising them fully and effectively.12,     I also recommend that any scheme for theexercise of powers under the Choice of Employment Actshould cintain provision inter alia   (i) for the adequate representation Of industry on the side both of employersand employed,    (ii) for the attendance of senior officersof the Ministry of Labour at the meetings of theCommittee.       These officers should not be allowed to voteahd provision might be made for the attendance ofan accredited representative if the senior officer is unable to attend, and (iii) for the regular meeting ofthe Committees entrusted with this work.13&apos;     The invitation thus extended to Authoritiesshould remain open for a period of 6 months with apossibility of extension in the case of CountyAuthorities.       I appreciate the urgency of the questionbut it would be unreasonable to hurry the decision ofthe Local Education Authority in so momentous a matter.14.     The decision of the Local Education authority should be binding for a period of 5&quot; years from thecoming into operation of their decision, and the decision should be regarded as operative for an additional termof 5 years unless the Authority gives notice 6 monthsprior to the date of the expiry of the first term of5 years that it wishes to vary its original decision.15*     I have suggested a period of five yearsbecause it will be possible during that period for local Education Authorities to review their positionespecially with reference to their responsibilities under-   6   -
the Education Act 1918. I think it is clearly equitable that Authorities should have this opportunity of varying their decision but I should deprecate the fixation of any period less than 5 years as some of the difficulties of the present position have undoubtedly arisen through the uncertainty from year to year as to the policy of the Government in this matter.

16.Representatives of the Ministry of Labour have expressed the view that it is both difficult and and undesirable to separate the general administration of the Unemployment Insurance Act as regards juveniles from the other work of employment committees. With this view I concur, and I consider that Authorities who have adopted, or now decide to adopt, the Choice of Employment Act should fee required to carry out these duties. Accept shoe of this obligation should be a condition precedent to the adoption or continuance of exercise of powers under the Choice of Employment Act. I am convinced by the evidence I have received that these duties would be accepted willingly by the Local Education Authorities, but in as such a requirement has probably no statutory Sanction I recommend that any necessary amendment of the Choice of Employment Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act should be undertaken. The cost of any part of this work which falls outside Authorities powers under the Choice of Employment Act should be repaid by the Ministry of labour and suitable arrangements for apportionment of common expenditure should be made. It goes without saying that this will involve the observance by Choice of Employment Committees of general regulations made by the Ministry of labour under the Act in connection with Unemployment Insurance.

17. I hope that this scheme may ensure peace. It is true that the dual system will continue to exist in the country as a whole, but in each local area the
-control will be-undlvided, for if the choice offered istaken in favour of local administration the local authority will have decisive control W&amp;thin its area, subject to theapproval of the Board of Education of its arrangements.   If,on the other hand, the local authority decides,to relinquishthe work to the Ministry of labour the Ministry will controland the local authority has no ground for complaint thatthe service is administered centrally and not locally,18.    In view of the abandonment of the agreement of1911 and of the character of the offer contemplated inthe previous paragraph, I do not consider that It would be fair to expect the Ministry of Labour to incur dry chargesotherwise than for the administration of UnemploymentInsuranoe if an authority decides to set up, or tocontinue, a Choice of Employment Committee.    At the sametime I regard the wide industrial oxperience of theMinistry as an important, indeed an essential factor inthe success of any scheme and contemplate that they willcontinue, both centrally and locally, to give any assistance and advice for which a local authority mayask.    In the same way I contemplate that if a \Juvenile Advisory Committee is set up under theMinistry of Labour the Local Education Authority will appoint representatives to sit on that Committee andwill afford all the help in their power.,.19..   Finally,I recommend that the Ministry ofLabour, and the Board of EducationsTshould establish a small standing Inter-Departmental Committee to discussquestions bearing on the conditions of juvenile employment&quot;generally as well as individual difficulties whioh may arise, as for instance those involved in the necessityfor co-operation in plsoing Juveniles between committees in adjoining areas,, and to supervise the -oolleotionof industrial information from, and the distributionof Industrial information.to^Committees of both types.
SOft   I am deoply grateful to the Assessors- forthe assistance whioh they have given me out of the-guineas cf their knowledge and experience and I mustplaoe on record my appreciation of the care and abilitywith which Mr. Wallis of the Board of Sclnsatio-n hasdischarged his duties as Secretary to the inquiry.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant4(sd.) omixBfomuE3rd July. 1921

th Meeting,siSII*ESXJu (1) With reference to B 28/,-and Cabinet 59 (21)ti- Conclusion 3, the Conference had before them thefollowing documents relating to the position betweenthe British Empire and Erance in regard to UpperrSilesia:-A despatch from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to Sir ma Cheetham (Paris)dated 27th July 19 21 (CP.3171)A translation of a Mote delivered by theFrench Ambassador on July 27th 1921 (C.1.3172)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsreviewed the communications which had recently passed between the two Governments and gave the conference a full account of his interview with the french ambassador on the previous day, in the course ofwhich Lord Curzon had called attention to the serious-ness of the step threatened in the French Note and itsconsequences upon the Alliance.   He had in particularasked the Ambassador if the Note emanated from theFrench Cabinet and with the authority of their PrimeMinister and had received the reply that lu.Briand wasin telephonic communication with his colleagues.   Afterthe interview the French Ambassador had later in theday addressed a letter to Lord Curzon in which heappeared to wish to modify the grave impression made bythe Note by indicating that the Note was intended toprevent misunderstanding and to oppose the attempt,^being made at Berlin to separate the Allies0The Conference realised that the whole tone ofthe French communications indicated a situation ofgreat tension.     In particular comment was made on^ thestatement that&quot;For an ally to oppose the despatch of reinforcements would be an act neither correctnor friendly&quot;&quot;and to the statement that&quot;the attitude of the British Government, if/ adhered to, would lead diroctly to aFranco-British rupture (&quot;conflit&quot;)&quot;.
While some doubt was expressed as to the precise meaning of the term &quot;conflit&quot; it was agreed that the documentindicated at least an intention on the part of prance toadopt in future a line praotically Independent of thiscountry.Lord Curzon, proceeding, said that he was not without some hope from various indications which had reached him,that M.Briand, in whose absence from Paris the presentposition of tension had developed, might not yet find someexcuse for easing the strain.    A telegram which had just been received from Sir M.Oheetham (Not538 dated July 27thhe1921) indicated that M.Briand, whom   had just interviewed,had taken pains to impress on Sir M.Cheetham that it was a mistake to suppose that he had not always been in favour ofa meeting of the Supreme Council and he seemed to expect thatexperts would be able to meet to-day (Thursday).     The FrenchCabinet was also to meet to-day.     lord Hardinge wasinterrupting his vacation and had left for Paris to-day.In Lord Hardinge&apos;s vie?/ the present situation is mainly&apos;attributable to H.Berthelot and it is probable that M.Briandwill adopt a more&apos; conciliatory attitude to this country.    Inthe meantime, lord Curzon continued, he was preparing for theconsideration of his colleagues a draft reply to the French note in the course of which he would correct the misstate-ments of fact in the French Note, denounce its baselesscharge that we were in any way instigating the policy follow-ed in Berliso  and contest the intolerable pretensions of theFrench Government that because certain troops were alleged tobe in peril it is entitled to send a Division to Silesiawithout not only the concurrence of the allies, but withoutaffording the Allies an opportunity of discussing the situation-ion.     This Reply it was hoped to have ready to despatch to Paris tonight..
In the course of the discussion which followed thestatement of the Secretary of State for Foreign ilffairscorroboration was given of the Ambassador&apos;s account of thechange in the attitude of the French towards the Alliancewhich in the opinion of many in France had served its purpose, and attention was drawn to the position whichwould arise if France resumed her independence and proceeded to send troops to Silesia   in defiance of Germany. This wouldmean the breakup of the Supreme Council and it was suggestedthat the proper course would then be to appeal to thoCouncil of the League of Nations as provided in the Treatyof Versailles.     In such an event it was not improbable that rather than face the issue France would withdraw from and break up the League of Nations,    it was also suggested to be desirable to keep the United States government informed of the position as it developed, to secure the goodwill and co-operation of Italy and Japan, and to beprepared if events moved unfavourably to make a statement in Parliament and to publish papers.The Conference agreed -(a) To adjourn until 5.30 that afternoon when lord curzon would submit his Draft Reply to the French note.(b) That questions on tho subject which had beenput down in Parliament should be postponed.

?ILESIA.

With referenoe held the same morning (E.31-C), the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported the latest developments in regard to the situation which has arisen in connection with affairs in Upper Silesia.

Since, the morning meeting, Lord Curzon had received a communication from the French Ambassador confirming that the previous Note (Paper C.P.-3172) had emanated from M. Briand himself, and adding a hope that the present conflict would not result in a rupture of Anglo-French relations. This communication had been made by M. Briand in the belief that the Prime Minister was to make a statement in Parliament the same afternoon.

Lord Curzon had also heard from Berlin (Foreign office telegram No. 397, dated July 27, 1921) that the French Ambassador there had issued an ultimatum to the German government categoriocal answer was given to the effect that unless by midday on July 28th and facilities provided for the transport of a French Division to Upper Silesia, the French Ambassador would at once advise his Government to take the necessary steps against Germany. He had also received a second communication from the British Ambassador at Berlin (Foreign Office telegram No,398, dated July 27, 1921) to the effect that the German Government would not give way to these continual menaces and would accept all the consequences.

Information had also been received from Paris to the effect that neither Marshal Foch nor General Weygand had been consulted as to the need of an additional French division in Upper Silesia. This indicated that the motives of the French policy were political rather than military.

Finally, information had been received that the Italian Foreign Minister had privately expressed the view that the despatch of the additional French Division to Upper Silesia ought not to be approved.
Having read in full the cormunications on which theabove summary is based, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs read the draft he had prepared of a Reply to the note of the French Government.Lord Curzon&apos;s draft was generally accepted as a firm and dignified statement of the British case.    The followingdrafting alteration was agreed tb:-The word &quot;conflict&quot; should be placed ininverted commas, or else the  French word&quot;conflit&quot; should be given in brackets.The general view of the Conference was that the trend of events was leading in the direction of isolated Frenchaction ^or the occupation of the Ruhr,The Conference were inclined to entertain favourablya suggestion made at the morning meeting that if France can-celled her invitation to a meeting of the Supreme Council on french soil we shea Id consider the desirability of summoninga meeting in London.The s\:ggestion made by the Prime Minister of Australia,that the dispute should be referred to the League of Nationsunder Article 11 of the Covenant, was reserved until a reply had been received to the BritI     Reply about to be sent.The suggestion was renewed that the Government of theUnited States of America should be kept au courant with thecours e o * event s.Subject to the minor alteration referred to above,the Conference  (a) approved the terms of the Reply to the French note prepared by the Secretary of State forForeign     fairs:f- -ex
(bV-ijwlWTthe Secretary&quot;Of State for ForeignAffairs toonofcify the British Ambassador in washington of the general position, and authorised him to inform the American secretary of State that if he were interested, we should be glad to furnishhim with detailed information.The Prime Minister intimated that he must defer his statement on the subject in Parliament until a reply had beenrebelVod to th&amp; British communication,,Whitehall Hardens, S.W.1,July 28; 1921.

With reference to Cabinet 58 (21), Conclusion 15, theCommittee had before them a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. 3116) covering adraft Bill providing for the settle-ment of claims by Irish Railway Companies against the &quot;State arisingout of the possession which the State has had of the railways duringthe war. The Irish Railway Companies had agreed to accept thesum of 3,000,000Lfree of income tax, and to give the State a completedischarge from liability. The Bill had been drafted to give effect tothis arrangement, and also to provide for the distribution amongthe companies of the 3,000,OOOZ. Of this sum 200,0001 wasspecifically allocated as a payment in advance to assist those companies who, after control ceases, are likely to work at a loss
Supreme CourtOfficers (Ketire-ment,Pensions, &amp;c.)Bill.Declaration of theTermination of theWar.during the remainder of the year. The balance was left for distribu-tion as may be agreed, or failing agreement as may be settled bythe Tribunal named in the Bill. The Bill also made other provisionsof a minor character.The Committee were informed that the Bill had been agreed withthe Treasury and was not likely to meet with any opposition in theHouse of Commons, except that possibly objection might be raised tothe constitution of the Tribunal mentioned in the Bill. It was not thought, however, that the anticipated objection would carry muchweight in the House.The Committee agreed To approve the introduction in the House of Commons by theMinister of Transport of the Irish Railways (Settlementof Claims) Bill subject to the consent of the Lord privy seal and the Government Whips.2. The Committee had before them draft of the Supreme CourtOfficers (Retirement, Pensions, &amp;c.) Bill (CP. 31-6) and an explana-tory memorandum (CP 3126 a). The Permanent Secretary to theLord Chancellor explained that the Bill was an agreed one in everysense, that is, that it had been agreed both with the Treasury andwith those officers whom it would affect. It was the last stage ofseries of economies which would be incomplete without it. immediate introduction of the Bill and its passage through Parliament wasnecessary because it would be impossible to enter on another Sessionof the Courts under the present conditions. There Were persons, forinstance, who were acting as Registrars, but who were not entitled todo so legally. Further, any delay in the passage of the Bill into lawwould make the carrying out of its provisions more difficult. TheBill had been the result of long negotiations, and its coming intoforce was necessary to the fulfilment of a bargain. It would benecessary to introduce the Bill in the House of Commons, as thoughsubstantially it effected economies it involved the, payment ofpensions on a higher scale ; the precedent set up by the iniroduc-tion in the House of Commons of a similar Bill some two years agoregarding County Court Judges, could not be ignored. It wasnot thought that thu Bill would meet with much opposition in theHouse of Commons although it would require explanation.The Committee agreed-That, subject to the assent of the Lord Privy Seal and theGovernment Whips, the Supreme Court Officers Bill(CP. 3126) should be introduced in the House of commons by the Home Secretary as soon us possible.3. With reference to H.A.C. 92, Conclusion 2, and H.A.C. 93,Conclusion the Committee had before them a memorandum by theTreasury regarding the effect of the declaration of the termination ofthe war (CP. 3 L 36). This memorandum embodied the substance ofthe replies of Departments to the Treasury circular letter which hadbeen sent out enquiring as to the effect on departmental work whicha declaration of the termination of the war on 4th August, 1921,would have It appeared that no serious obstacle to such a declara-tion existed except, firstly, the fact that regulations could not bemade under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1920, until 1st September(with the result that the traffic in such drugs would be unregulatedduring August), and secondly, the fact that the Disposals commission were obliged to deal with a great deal of property which had been occupied under the Defence of the Realm Act, and which would haveto be surrendered three months after the termination of the war,unless other arrangements were made by Departments.
General agreement was expressed with the view that1st September would be an appropriate date. As regards thedifficulty anticipated by the Disposals Commission, it was pointedout that after the war had been declared at an end the commission would still have three months in which to obtain the assent of theproper Government Departments and make the necessary arrange-ments in regard, to property occupied under the Defence of the realm Act. If the Commission began on this task immediatelythey would have over four months.There was further in favour of the date of the 1st september the fact that the payment of pensions at war rates involved an expenditure of 40,0001. a month. In this connection it was pointedout that a decision would have to be reached in regard to the reportof the Committee on Post-war Disability Rates (see Cabinet 48 (21),Conclusion 3) which would take effect thirty days after the legaltermination of the war.General agreement was expressed with the view that thequestion of the date at which the war should be declared to be at anend was one that need not be referred to the Cabinet.The Committee agreed 1. That the date for the termination of the war should be the1st September, 1921, and that the Treasury should have authority to take steps for the issue of an Order inCouncil declaring the 1st September, 1921, as the dateof the termination of the war.2. To take note of the fact that it would be necessary for theCabinet to deal with the report of the Committee on post-war Disability Rates before the date at which thewar would be declared to be at an end.4. The Committee had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. 3141.) covering a Bill which hadbeen drafted to carry out the recommendations of the Committeeappointed by the Treasury to consider what amendments should bemade in the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866. these recommendations were (1.) That greater discretion should be given to the controller and Auditor-General by relieving him of the le^alobligation to apply 100 per cent, audit and by enablinghim to substitute test audits. This provision wouldlegalise what had been the practice of the Auditor-General for some time past. It was explained to theCommittee that a complete audit of accounts wasconsidered to be unnecessary and to involve a waste ofthe services of trained auditors.(2.) That statutory powers should be given to the controller and Auditor-General to deal with various forms of accounts, such as trading accounts, which had grown upsince the Act of 1866. At present the Controller and auditor-General has no statutory duty with regard tosuch accounts.The Bill&apos;also provided for the abolition of the post of Assistant-Controller and Auditor, and for regularising the salary of theController and Auditor-General who, in accordance with the recom-mendations of the Asquith Committee, had received 3,0OOL a year from the 1st March, 1920, although his statutory salary remainedunaltered at 2,000L a year.The opinion was expressed that it would be undesirable tointroduce the Bill at so late a stage of the Session, and attention was drawn to the provisions regarding the audit of trading accounts andthe. salary of the Controller and Auditor-General which, it was
thought, would give rise to considerable parliamentary discussion.It was urged that every hour of parliamentary time was preciousat this stage of the Session, and that there could be no urgent necessity to. regularise the position in regard to the Controller and auditor-General&apos;s salary since the increased payment had been madeby the Treasury for nearly a year and a-half without difficulty.At the request of the Chairman of the Committee theController and Auditor-General made a statement. Any delay inthe introduction and passage into law of the Bill, he said, would place him in a delicate position. It was his duty to report any suchillegality as had occurred in the payment of his own salary to theHouse of Commons, unless the earliest opportunity were taken otbringing the matter before the House and regularising it. He was due to retire next month, and before retiring he thought it his duty to make a report regarding his own salary unless the Bill becamelaw. The pre-ent Bill was the earliest opportunitj7 of regularisingthe position. It had been approved by the Public Accounts Com-mittee, who were satisfied with it, and he felt that it was very unlikely to occupy much time in the House, especially as the wholeobject of the Bill was to tighten control. Moreover, as regards the test audit, he had for years been contravening the statute, and his action required immediate legislation. There was the further factthat the audit of trading accounts required to put on a statutory basis.There was general agreement that the Bill was necessary on its merits, but very strong exception was taken to its introduction this session since it was considered that the Bill would certainly lead tolengthy debates and occupy much valuable time. It was thoughtthat the Treasury would properly be able to claim that, in view ofthe extreme pressure of parliamentary business this Session, no failurehad occurred to bring the matters covered by the Bill before theHouse at the earliest possible moment if the Bill were introducednext Session and not this Session, and on this assumption the treasury would be able to continue paying the Controller and Auclitor-General&apos;s salary at the higher rate. It &quot;was clear that the Bill couldnot be regarded as non-controversal in view of the letter dated7th July, 1921, from the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committeeto the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (see Cmd. 1383), in whichit was stated that the Committee might in due course express their individual views as Members of the House of Commons, and, further,at the end of the letter, that there were other points in the report onwhich the members of the Committee desired to reserve their rightto express their opinion in the House.In view of the opinion of the Committee it was suggestedthat the Bill might be introduced and not proceeded with this session, and that possibly an introduction two days before the Houserose would be convenient.After some discussion the Committee agreed (1.) That they could not recommend the introduction into Parlia-ment and the passage into law this Session of theExchequer and Audit Bill (CP. 3141) in view of thelateness of the Session and the great pressure ofparliamentary business ;(2.) That if, however, the Financial Secretary to the Treasuryafter consideration thought it desirable that the Billshould be introduced simply and not proceeded with this session the Committee would raise no objection, providedthat the consent of the Lord Privy Seal and the Goyern-ment Whips were obtained.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,July 20, 1921.
