DT3FENCE EXPEND-        1c mhe Cabinet resumed their discussion of anTfPTJRE INpnTURE YE-^RS .      Interim Report, by the Minister for Co-ordination ofXnterim Defence (CcP*-3l6 (37)) on Defence Expenditure in report hythe Minister      Future Years, which had. been begun at the Meeting of-To1&quot; Co-ordination the Cabinet the same morning.0-f Defence.The First Lord, of the /dmiralty had two commentsfPrevious to make.    Referring to para.gra.phs 56 and. 57 of the reference:Cabinet 48 Report, he pointed out that the only departures from(3 7)s Con-clusion 9.)       the DsRtC. Fleet contained in the Admiralty&apos;s pro-posals for 1938-39 were to the extent of constructingone Destroyer Flotilla and three Submarines, whichwould probably not be laid, down until the end of thefinancial year.    In reply to the Prime Minister he explained that if it was eventually decided not to exceed the original DoR.Cc Fleet, the construction ofthese ships need not necessarily amount to more than .a speeding up of the D.R.C. programme,This  construction, however, would be necessary ifit were decided to exceed the D.R.C. Fleet, and theadoption of this plan would enable the Cabinet to postpone their decision on the larger question.The Secretary of State for Var joined in thegeneral congratulations       *he Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.    He thanked him especially forhis sympathetic words that morning in rega.rd to thedifficulties of the Army Council.   He did not differ in principle from the Minister for Co-ordination, and.for some time ha&apos;1 himself been coming, to similarconclusions.    He recalled that the Cabinet had neveraccepted the whole of the War Office programme.times for developing a field force for service in Europe.    Itwould be an advantage to the Army to have the new r&amp;leclearly defined, and he had no doubt that, it was right
to put the Continental expedition last. The situation was very different from that which prevailed in 1914. Public opinion in this country did not favour the idea of sending an army to the Continent. There was teh growth of the air danger. In 1914 we had not had the Palestine commitment there was no Italian danger to Egypt, and Japan was friendly. He himself had been finally converted on the occasion of his visit to the French manoeuvres. He had learned there that the Maginot Line only required 100,000 men to hold it, which left a large reserve for the French Field Army. He thought that when the French realised, that we could not commit ourselves to send  an expedition they would be the more inclined to accelerate the extension of the Maginot Line to the sea.

Turning to the Territorial Army, he welcomed the Minister for Co-ordination&apos;s interpretation of paragraph 79 (ii) of his Report. It would be a breach of faith to leave the Territorials under the impression that they were liable to be turned into a mere police force in war, after all their military training.

As to the Regular Army, he concurred with the statement in paragraph 71 that our Imperial commitments overseas would go far to absorb our military resources in war. This was the case even now, and the War office were forced to all kinds of devices and shifts to find men for the purpose. Nearly all the reservists who had volunteered for service in certain Battalions had revoked when they had learned that they were going to Palestine.  He hoped, therefore, that the Cabinet would support certain proposals tha he was putting forward for popularising the Army. He asked the Cabinet to note that the Army was brought into all the roles of defence entioned by the Minister for Co-ordination in paragraphs 41 to 44. The Army Council, therefore, had a onsiderable responsibility. Now that the Minister
for Co-ordination of &quot;Defence had laid down the role of the British Army it would, be necessary for the tfarOffice to review the whole scheme of the Army, includingestablishments, reserves, accommodation, factories and so forth, in order to ascertain how much might be cancelled.    mo ^his must be added the fact that therehad been important  changes in the General Staff.   he hoped, therefore, that the Chancellor of the exchequer would realise that he must not expect an Army on thenew model to be devise^ in a. week or two, although thetyar Office wa.s tackling the job with good will and.energy.   He was  confident that some millions;could be saved, but he hoped that some of them wouldbe devoted to the comfort of the soldier.The Secretary of State for Air sai^ that he wouldhave to trouble the Cabinet at greater length than theother Service Ministers, since important strategicalquestions were raised in the Report of the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence.   He thanked, the Ministerfor the efforts he had. ma.de.   He himself was notpresenting a purely Departmental point of view^   just as the financial situation was of great importance to imperial Defence, so there were other things whichwere vital to safety and. which affected the nature ofthe insurance we had to try to provide.   He called,attention to his own Most Secret Paper (D.P,(P) 12)on the Strength o^ the Royal Air Force and air defence,  circulated with the Report of the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence, which contained, anexposition of the German situation,    Tf the Germansdid not reach their estimated strength it would be easy to curtail our own programme:    but what was notpossible, especially in the case of the Air Force,
-was to improvise at short notice.    This appliedespecially to recruiting, where difficulties wereheginning to be encountered.Turning to the position oversees, the proposals put forward by the Air Staff had been the minimum for security.    The Minister for Go-ordination ha.d proposedto accept the risk of limiting our overseas provision to the 12 squadrons in Scheme &quot;P&quot;.    ^hat was a riskwhich he feared, the Government would have to take, for,as the Prime Minister had often observed, the key toour own safety problem was Germany, and. if risks hadto be taken it must ^e oversea and not at. home.Turning to the Metropolitan Air Force, theMinister&apos;s proposals involved risks  from the point ofview of both policy and strategy.    Poth in order tosatisfy the political  commitment, but even more with aview to the erection of an effective deterrent to war,we could not afford to have a first-line strengthinferior to that of Germany.    The Air Staff, as appearedfrom his own Paper, had not based their proposals on ame?*e mathematical comparison,   He thought that theordinary man would interpret the Governments pledgesas involving a strength equal to that of Germany, andprobably an equal number of machines.    ^he Air staff had not done this.    He had asked the Air Staff to base their calculations on the Chancellor of the Exchequersinterpretation in the House of Commons, which he read.to the Cabinet as follows:-&quot;This policy has been plainly stated onsevera.1 occasions.    It is to create and maintain an Air Force which will form an effective deterrent and insurance of peace,and. which, in the unhappy event of war,would be able to meet a potential enemy on equal terms.&quot;
He had done this because he wanted the Air Staff toconsider in that light  the composition of the german air Force,    &quot;&quot;hat Force consisted of lone-range aircraft,fighters,  coastal aircraft, Army Co-operation Squadrons,to which had recently been added some short-r^ngebombers for co-operation in the field      The Air Staff,in making their calculations, had eliminated, all aircraft except bomber&apos;5 that could be used, against this country, and had asked for an equal number off first-line machines to these.    The Minister for Co-ordination had suggested in his Paper that it was unnecessary, in order *o provide an effectivedeterrent, that our Air &quot;orce should be able to drop the same number and type of bombs on the aggressor,day in and day out, as that  country could drop on us(Paragraph ^8) ,.    That was not 4he strategy conceivedby the Air Staff*    Their scheme provided for defence in two p^rts:(l) Defensive aircraft;(S)  Counter offensive.Referring to the latter, he informed the Cabinet thatfor two years the Air Staff had been engaged on a.detailed  examination of possible targets in certain countries.    Their object, however, was no1/ counter-attack, as the Minister1s Report seemed to suggest(for there was no &quot;London&quot; in Germany), but  to reducethe enemy&apos;s power of attack by bombing his aerodromes,factories, etc.    Any other course would, involve our being pla.ced on a. pure defensive, which, apart, fromother considerations, would be demoralising to the(by reducing the losses incurred by the enemy)personnel o   Moreover, that course/&apos;would, involveincreasing the purely defensive forces up to at least the standard of the full ideal defence (an addition of45 Squadrons) as well as the ground defences,
Consequently he 61* not think it possible to have an air Force that did not provide an effective deterrentby its offensive power.    It was, of course, alwayswithin the power of the Cabinet to give instructionsto the Air Staff as to the size of the Royal Air Force.But what the Cabinet  could not do was to tell the AirStaff that it was providing an adequate force when theAir Staff knew that this was not the case.    The only way to put it would be that the policy had been changed.Turning to the question of reserves, he agreed withthe Minister that in the circumstances of today it wasimpossible to be 100$ safe, and that we must have an effective wa.r potential.    Even this war potential,however, was not 8.n alternative to the 225$ war reserves, the object of which was to tide over untilthe factories were producing.   When the 225$ had been calculated,  comparatively little had been known of thetime-table of war production.    Now a. good deal morewas known on the subject.   Fortunately the &quot;shadow&quot;factories ha.d been a great success, but even if a firmlike Austins was fully equipped and jigged, it wouldtake six months from the word being given before itcould be in production:    and that was apart from therisk of war damage.    mhe only alternative to havingboth reserves and wa.r potential was for the Air force to go slow during the first six months of a war.Nevertheless, unless we had reached the conclusionthat war in the near future was a practical certainty,,it was impossible to make every preparation:   so hethought the right course was to reduce the reserves &apos;and to po in for increased war potential.    Reservesinvolved great waste if there were no war, whereas war potential was an asset to the country.    In addition,foreign countries had no means of estimating the extent
of our ivar reserves4 whereas the existence of &quot;shadow&quot;factories was in itself a strong deterrent to war.In the light of what must he anticipated as tothe strength of the Crewman Air Force, as well as ofour announced commitments, he suggested, that theGove^nrent  could not accept less than Scheme &quot;J&quot;without a complete reversal of policy.   They ought tobuild and, above all, to recruit the personnel, onwhich he laid, the utmost stress, up to that basis,and to prepare plans for a resl war potential.He agreed with what *he Minister h*d said inparagraphs *4 to 36 about the desirahility of economy in production.    It was probably not realised how muchwas already being done in that direction, of which he gave some particulars.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, looking at the matter broadly, the effect of the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence&apos;s scheme appeared to be thatthe Admiralty woul^  continue for next year on theirpresent basis and. that in twelve months&apos;  time adecision would be taken as to whether their programme was to ^e increased.   The Air Force was to be increased,by the adoption of part of Scheme nJ*&apos;-    but the largestchanges were to be made in the role of the Army, whichhe hoped would save many millions.   He pointed out thatthe authorised programme for the Air Force at present was Scheme &quot;F&quot;&apos; and not Scheme &quot;J&quot;.   Consequently whatthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was suggestingwas an advance substantially from Scheme &quot;F&quot; in thedirection of meeting the enemy over our own towns.His own view was in favour of concentrating onincreases in the Metropolitan Air Force as proposed in cp.-316 (37) paragraph 96 (i), and. on the provisionof the full increase asked for in the Fighter squadrons of the Metropolitan Force (Paragraph 98 (ii)).-7-
As regards (iii) there was a considerable differ-once between the two proposals in (a) and (b) .   To put225$ of reserves in store against the risk of war was an intelligible proposition, but in five to seven years it might mean that we should possess a mass of obsoletemachines, whereas if the money was put into war potential the factories would be able to produce up todate machines. -   He thought, therefore, there was great force in the argument that, an increase in war potential was better than an exaggerated production of reserves.^urning to the question of pledges, he sai* that many factors went to make up parity, which did notconsist of a. mere counting of machines; and on this basis it. woul^ be quite easy to reach a point where wecould not compete any longer.   He thought, however, thatthe Minister&apos;s proposals carried out the pledges.The Prime Minister said, that no pledge could last for ever. He was prepared to defend a departure fromearlier pledges if the Cabinet thought it necessary.^he Chancellor of the Exchequer,  continuing, saidthat in substance he was prepared to approve the Report,so that the Minister &quot;for Co-ordination could proceed,with the same assistance as before from Treasury andother Officials, to get the second part, of the report prepared as soon as possible.   He pointed out the urgency of this from the point of view of the time-table.The date when the Service Estimates had to be publishedwas either the en* of February or the earliest days ofMarch.    In the ordinary way the Chancellor of theExchequer would allow the publication of these Estimates,but he did not have to consider how they were to be-financed until the end of March, since he knew that payment would be made only out of taxation,   ^hesituation now, however, was quite different^ because-8-
part of the payment would be made out of loan.    Inthat ease a document had to be presented with theEstimates stating how much of them would be paid forout of loan expenditure, and before they were publishedhe himself would have to determine how much of eachEstimate was to be paid from borrowed money.   He couldnot decide that until he had some idea of the defence expenditure during the next five years.    If the total sum was to ^e larger than he had anticipated, he would,have to consider whether it would not be better toincrease taxation:    but if the circumstances were morefavourable he would take a different view as to how much to pay by taxation and. how much by loan.   his conclusion was, therefore, that as the Estimates must&apos;ie published by the end. of February, the five-yes.rforecasts of the &quot;Defence &quot;Departments ought to reach theMinister for Co-ordination by, say, January 20th.The Minister for Co-ordination would then have to addthe^ together and. circulate to the Cabinet his further report, containing his recommendations by, say, February10th.    The Cabinet  could then consider them at aMeeting on February 16th, in order tha.t by the end. ofFebruary the treasury might determine the amount thatwas to be provided, by loan.   He emphasised that what he was asking for was not an elaborate &quot;book&quot; comparable to the Annual Army Estimates, which would, take months to prepare.    So far as the Army Estimates of 1938-39were concerned, the only possibility was to use theEstimates already discussed between the Treasury and.the War Office, adjusted so far as possible to the new situation.   What he was asking for at. the moment, however,was not new Estimates but a general forecast of expendi-ture over the next five years.   His suggestion to allthe Fighting Services was that they should, submit their
Estimates for publication very much on the lines ofthe present scheme, but he wanted them, in addition,to send to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defencetheir forecasts over five years.The Secretary of State for Var pointed out thatthe proposals of th^ Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence involved the creation of a new model Army.Every kind of detail had to be examined:    for example,how many men there were to be in a. station:    how manyguns in a battery.    The examination of all this was avery protracted matter.    Tt was so important, that ifdone at all it ought to be done well.   He was grateful for permission to prepare his Estimates on the oldbasis, but a.sked if the five-year programme, was of equal urgency.^he Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised thatthe five-year programme was required, from. ea.ch of theServices to enable him to ju^ge how much of theEstimates for the next year was to be financed fromloan.The Prime Minister pointed out t hat the TreasuryEstimate had. to take into account Civil as well as military expenditure.   Any errors that might arise in the rough estimates of the ;.Var Office would, notbulk very large in so vast a. sum,^he Secretary of State for tfar said that this meant that the officials of the Var Office would, haveto give up all idea of a Christmas holiday, and. at best he could only produce a. very rough approximation.The Chancellor o^ the Exchequer drew attention to paragraph 47, in which the Minister for Co-ordinationhad pointed out that in order to complete the revisedforecasts of cost of Defence Programmes the basis ofthe policy outlined in his Report must be approved.
He urged the Cabinet to give this approval, a.fterwhich the Minister for Co-or^ina-tion of Defence wouldhave the task of overhauling the forecasts on the same basis *s before, that  is to say, with the help ofvarious officials of the Treasury and other Depart-ments .    Until that total was known we did. not knowwhether the programmes would be within the fina.ncialcapacity of the country to carry them out.   Prom thispoint of view he attached great importance to para-graphs o to 14 of the Report, headed. &quot;The defence programmes an^ our available Resources&quot;,The Home Secretary,, who as former First Lord. had.been responsible for the recommendation in favour ofa new standard of naval strength,  considered that without an improvement in Anglo-German relations itwould be necessary to complete at least 20 Capita.1Ships.    He suggested., therefore, that the Minister forCo-ordination,, in consultation with the First. Lord,should ensure that in providing new naval training establishments some surplus space should be allowedto provide for training new personnel, if necessary,within the next few years.So far as the Army was  concerned, he a.greed withthe new role proposed, and that, the Continentalcommitment should  come last.    This should make a.tremendous  change in the Army?    for example,  in thequestion of equipmento    He thought the Territorialsshould have some, training in air raid precautionswork.Coming to the Air Force, while he was impressed by the financial  considerations, he found it difficultto agree to proposals which ran counter to the views
of the Air Staff.   That was a very serious responsi-bility for the Cabinet.   He recalled that, when he had.been Secretary of State for Air, Lord Trenchard had always advocated, the provision of three -b^ab-er-s- toone fighter.    He hoped, therefore, that the cabinet would not come to any decision approving the proposalsfor fighters but limiting the bombers.    Tn a. future warthe enemy&apos;s efforts were likely to be devoted towards a. knock-out blow.    That brought out the importance off first-line strength.   He hoped that the questionof reserve a v. war potential would, be considered furtherfrom, that-^ppint of view,
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he would not discuss the proposals in paragraph 37of the Report hy the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence hearing on Foreign Policy, as these aspects had formed the subject of recent discussions     He had someapprehensions as to our inability to assist our allies on land, but the arguments in the Report appeared to himirresistible and the position was quite different from1954.      In reading the Report, he had formed the opinionthat we were concentrating too much on the defensive *The Army was to have an entirely defensive role and it was proposed to deprive the Air Force of part of ^tfs^/Ajz^offensive power^     He agreed with the Home secretary that the Cabinet should not interfere with the AirMinistry as to the distribution cf our resourcesbetween offensive and defensives     He had also beendisturbed by the suggestion of the Secretary of Statefor War^that the country was opposed to sending forcesabroad^      If the Channel ports fell into the hands of/CGermany, the country would not be safe0      If war wasto take place in Western Sorope, an attack on France byGermany was the most probable operation to be envisaged.He did. not under-rate the value of the Maginot Lines,but might we not be called on to help?      It was truethat M. Delbds had said that France only expected us toprovide two mechanised Divisions and Mo Daladier had said something of the same kind J;o the Secretary of Statefor War, but both statements had overlooked Belgium andhad been made on the assumption that Belgium could look after herself.     If, however, there was an invasion ofBelgium or Holland,/the Chiefs, of Staff had shown again and again that the ebjoot would bo to break through intoFrance.     He would not ask to change the order of
priority, but he thought it essential that when adecision had been taken,  the French Government shouldbe told so that the two countries might considertogether how    their   countries were to be defended.,He had been impressed by the Secretary of State forAir&apos;s paper.     From an International point of view,  thestrength of the Air Force was of the first importance as illustrated by the impression nade on the MilchMission0      From this point of view, he would very muchlike to see Scheme J adopted^     At any rate so far asthe Metropolitan part was concerned, including bombersas well as fightersc     I.e would like to know also whether,the Secretary of State for War contemplated being in aposition to provide the two mechanised Divisions desired by the Frenchc      If, however,  there should be any margin,he hoped that priority would be given to the AirMinistry&apos;s Scheme -J and that there would be no revisionor watering-down of our pledgesoThe Secretary of State for War said that if our resources were larger, he could provide a biggerArmy but, in view of our contribution by means of sea,air and finance, he did not think that the French oughtto expect we could furnish an Army as wello      He agreedthat the French ought to be told of our decision.      Sofar our conversations with the French had been confined to Belgium0     He thought they ought to extend over thewhole world,,      France would then be brought to realise that if the United Kingdom were subjected to air attack,it would be wrong for them to count on an ExpeditionaryForce from this country,,      The only way he could supplytwo mechanised Divisions was by dividing the existingDivision into two, but it was conceived on lines rather
larger than in some countriescThe Secretary of State for Air said he understood that the intention of the Minister forCo-Ordination of Defence was to leave Scheme P in tactand to increase the fighters of the Metropolitan AirForce up to the scale of Scheme Jo      In addition therewas to he some increase in the first-line strength of bombers to meet the German 50 per cento increase.v.Further, the merits of reserves of war potential wereto be again consideredoThe Minister for Go-Ordination of. defence agreed that that was the case broadly,  though he did not want to tie himself up to figures.The Home Secretary pointed out that on that basis the question of parity was avoided for the moment,as in the case of the Navy.The Lord Chancellor was impressed by theadvantages of war potential as compared with largematerial reserves which were extravagant in peace,since they must sooner or later become obsolete andmight even have become obsolete by the time war broke out.The Prime Minister pointed out that factorieshad to be kept up to date just as much as reserves.Without new jigs they would not be able to produce new types of machinesoThe Secretary of State for Air agreed with thePrime minister      He emphasised that without strongreserves, it was impossible to make good the lossesincurred during the early months of a war.     Even if the machines in reserve were not of the very latest type,they would be better than none.      The estimate ofSS5 per cent, had been worked out on a most carefulcomputation of the rate of casualtiesc     The rate variedfor different types of machines0
The Lord President of the Council shared theviews of the Secretary of State for Air and the HomeSecretary on the air side of the question.     As to the role of the Army, he hoped that the Cabinet would notoverlook the warning given hy the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence in paragraph 75 -&quot;If Prance were again to he in danger ofbeing over-run by land armies, a situation might arise when, as in thelast war, we had to improvise an army to assist her.     Should this happen, theGovernment of the day would most certainly be criticised for havingneglected to provide against so obviousa contingency.&quot;His general impression of the Report and of thediscussion was that the Minister had been right toemphasise the importance of the relation of diplomacyto re-armament.     At the same time, the Report led himto the conclusion that we must work to an expenditureof about  1,500 milliono over the next five years,.although he also deduced that this sum was inadequate.That brought out clearly how the limitations imposed onde fence by finance threw a heavy burden on todiplomacy.      In spite of all the efforts of the ForeignSecretaryf  the Prime Minister and others, we had arrivedat a position which    -    above all we had wished toavoid and in which we were faced with the possibilityof three enemies at once.      The conclusion which he drew - and he had no doubt that it would be shared bythe Foreign Secretary - was that this threw an immenselyheavy burden on diplomacy and that we ought to make every possible effort to get on good terms with Germany.     he realised the great pressure on the Foreign Secretarybut, after this discussion, he felt it was of greatimportance to make further progress in improvingrelations with Germany.
The Foreign Secretary recalled that the firsttask was for the French Government and for ourselves todecide what could he done in the colonial sphere.The Prime Minister agreed that no further move could he made with Germany until after furtherexplorations.     The point that impressed him was that whatever we could do in the colonial sphere must becounter-balanced by some move by Germany.     Publicopinion would not tolerate an arrangement on any otherlines.     He recalled that at the preliminary consideration which had been given to the subject, ithad been thought that the German contribution to asettlement might take the form of some measure of disarmament.     Herr Hitler had made a statement to theLord President which opened the possibility of someadvance on these lines.     He had accordingly taken onhimself to ask the Minister for Co-Ordination of defence to go into the technical aspects of the question of limitation or bomber aeroplanes as well as of other forms of qualitative disarmament.     So far as the general question was concerned, he hoped to address himself tothe matter during the Recess with a view to a meetingof the Committee on Foreign Policy in the New Year.In reply to the Secretary of State for theColonies, the Prime Minister said he did not require anyspecial researches to be undertaken at the presentmoment.on the colonial issue.A short discussion took place on these matters in which the difficulties of air limitation wererecalled.The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew attention to the fact that overseas defence appeared
only in the third category of priori ty*     If theAir Force could not concentrate at places overseas,he thought it very important that in overseas possesions particularly vulnerable to attack, likeMalta, the anti-aircraft defences should be put in ahigher category of expenditure so that these placesshould not be entirely defenceless and somedeterrent should be offered to attack.He attached great importance to paragraphs 6-14 ofthe Minister&apos;s Report in which he had set forth the.importance of the maintenance of our economic stabilityas an essential element in our defensive strength.This had often been spoken of, but he did not recallseeing it put forward as a vital consideration on defence.      In his view,  this was a matter of frrr-timportance.      It might be that in the next war ourenemy would aim at a &quot;knock-out&quot; blow, but the^evidence before him did not show that that was likely/.4n -that event-, the factor of our staying power mustbe present in the minds of other Governments as wellare our chances in a long war. He hoped, therefore,that the Cabinet would take a very special note ofthis aspect of the Minister&apos;s paper*, Turning to the summary of issues arising on the Report, as set forth in paragraph 101, he presumed that the aggregate summentioned to in item 1 referred to the  1,500 millionsmentioned in paragraph 31.agreed, but asked that  1,500 millions should not. !taken as a rigid figure.   For example, it might beThe Prime Minister summed up the discussion.They must be asking themselves whatThe Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence
necessary in order to meet particular needs (heinstanced Malta) to incur some relatively smalladditional expenditure.The Prime Minister agreed.     The Minister&apos;spoint was covered by the phrase he had used inparagraph 31 -&quot;Every effort must be made to bring thetotal Defence Expenditure over the fiveyears 1937-4-1 within the total of 1,500 millions.&quot;The Prime Minister continuing said thatitem 2 &quot;Principles of Priority&quot; was, he thought,acceptable to the Cabinet, but this did not mean, ofcourse, that no item must be begun until the previous item in the priority list had beon completed.    There must be agood deal of elasticity in the application of theprinciples^     Items 3 &quot;Navy&quot;, 4 &quot;A.D.G-.B.&quot; and 5&quot;Regular Army&quot; were acceptable.     Turning to item 6&quot;Territorial Army&quot;, in view of what the Secretary ofState for War had said, he thought it might be laiddown that the Territorial Army would be used in the same way as the Regular Army.     While some part of both maybe used for internal security duties, no part of theTerritorial Army should be specially allocated for this task.     On the subject of item 7 &quot;Air&quot;, he suggestedthat the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence should proceed for the present on the lines suggested inparagraph   98 (iii) (a) of CP. 316 (37) which would allow him a good deal of elasticity, and that he should discuss the matter with the Secretary of State for Air.,but all this should be on the understanding that no final decision had been reached.     If it should prove that there was any margin out of the  1,500 millions,the possibility of doing more for the Air Force could beconsidered.
The Secretary of State for Air accepted this the understanding that there was no final decision0The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the Report of theMinister for Co-Ordination of Defence(CP. 316 (37)) subject to thefollowing:-(b) To take note,with approval, of thepropositions in paragraphs 6-14of the Report which state the relation between the factors ofeconomic resources and stabilityon the one hand and the fulfilment of adequate Defence Programmes on theother.(c) In response to the Minister&apos;request in paragraph 101,  to adoptthe statement of policy on which our Defence Programmes should bebased, as set forth in Part IV ofthe Report and as applied in Part V,subject to the following:-(i) That, as stated in paragraph 59,the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence will deal, in his nextReport, with any modifiedproposals involving a departure from the D.R.C. standard whichthe Admiralty may wish tosuggest, but that the finaldecision as to an increasedstandard of Naval strengthneed not necessarily be taken until next year:(ii) That the primary role of theRegular Army should be as statedin the Minister&apos;s Report,&apos; viz.^that of Imperial commitmentsincluding anti-aircraft defence at home.     The role of theTerritorial Army should be asset forth in paragraph 79 of cp. 316 (37) omitting sub-paragraph (ii) for which thefollowing should be substituted:-t&quot;(ii)   The scale of air attack now envisagedon this country mightwell result in the dislocation of essential services, orin some loss of moralein crowded areas.There is also theproblem of evacuationto be considered.Some part of both theRegular Army and theTerritorial Army may
be used for internal security duties, but no part of theTerritorial Army should be especially allocated for this task.&quot;(iii)    That as regards the policy for theexpansion of the Air Force, no final decision was reached on paragraph 98 (iii) of the Report,but that the Minister for Go-Ordination of Defence should, inhis future investigations, proceed on the basis of that paragraph, andin consultation with the Secretaryof State for Air.      In particular,further examination should be madeof the linked questions of theprovision of war reserves and war potential,,(d) To take note that the Estimates of theDefence Departments for the FinancialYear 1938-39 should be completed on thebasis of the drafts now under preparation.(e) To take note that the above Estimates must include as appropriations-in-aid the total sum to be issued in the year under theDefence Loans Act*     In order to enable theChancellor of the Exchequer to reach adecision as to the total sums to be soissued, he will require a forecast of the anticipated expenditure on the defence programmes up to March, 1942,     In orderthat this forecast may be available in timefor the publication of the defence estimates at the beginning of March, theDepartments concerned should submit revisedforecasts of the cost of their Programmesover the next five years in accordance withthe above decision to the Minister forCo-Ordination of Defence at the latest byFriday, January 21st, so that he may circulatehis further Report to the Cabinet not later than Thursday, February 10th, with a view to consideration and decision by the Cabinet onWednesday, February 16th.(f) To take note that, inasmuch as the total of.the conclusions reached as the result of theabove steps must be subject to consideration at a later stage of the ability of the countryto bear the total burden involved.(g)   To take note -known,German Colonies,(i)   That the limitations which financeImposes on National Defence place a heavy burden on diplomacy whichrenders it desirable as soon as maybe to follow up the conversations between the Lord President of theCouncil and Herr Hitler;    and(Previous Reference:Cabinet 43 (37)Most Secret Annex to conclusion 3.)

PR-TISK I*TNERCOMMUNICATIONJCROSS THEP/crpic.(previous reference:Cabinet .ST8(36), Con-elusion 9 and appendix *)2.    .      The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-313 (37)) on the subject ofBritish Liner Communication across the Pacific, inwhich it was stated that the Canadian-AustralasianLine had applied to the various interested Governmentsof the British Commonwealth for financial assistanceto enable it to build, vessels capable of holding theirown against those of the Matson Line, which receivedextensive financial assistance from the United StatesGovernment.   The matter was first considered in its technical aspects by the Imperial Shipping Committee,and at the Imperial Conference, 193 7, a Committee ofMinisters representing the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, Canada, the Australian Commonwealth and New2ea.la.nd, the general outline of a scheme Of assistance(the main features of which were summarised in an appendix to the Memorandum) was adopted.    It might beassumed that the Commonwealth and New Zealand Govern-ments approved the scheme in principle, but thenowCanadian Government were/unable to do so.   The imme&amp;i-ate question was whether any further steps should betaken by the United Kingdom Government at this stagewith a view to finding a. solution.    mhe authors ofthe Memorandum thought that the next moves mightsafely be left, to the other pa.rties. If, however, theadvice o** the United Kingdom Government was sought bythe Commonwealth or New Zealand Governments, theMinisters proposed to advise them to carry on thediscussions direct with Canada, on the understandingthat the United Kingdom Government, if their co-operation was desired, remained ready to co-operate,subject to fundamental conditions, of which theprincipal ones were:-
(l)-That the interest of the Dominion C*)v-e^nn*eutsis direct and&quot; primary-  *t(2) That the scheme must not involve the granthy the United Kingdom Government of a subsidy to the Line.The President of the Board of Trade explained the whole case on the lines of his papers and statedthat his memorandum had been circulated primarily for the information of the Cabinet.The Lord President of the Council said thatleaving the initiative to someone else was the line that was constantly criticised in debates in the Houseof Lords.      He asked whether it would not be p- -ssiblefor us to take rather a more active line.In the subsequent discussion it was pointed outthat His Majesty&apos;s Government had a strong case   inthis matter.      Although less concerned than some of theDominions, they had,  in fact,  taken the leading part and been ready to lend their credit.      At thepresent moment, however,  the initiative clearly lay with the Governments of Australia and New Zealand.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat the Canadian Minister of Defence had done hisT&amp;est in this matter, but had had to yield to otherMembers of the Canadian Cabinet-      The dominions office had used all their influence to try and press this matter forward.The Cabinet took note of the Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and approved the general line he proposed to take*

For this reason he desiredto reserve the right to sugeest alterations in thepresent proposals if the actual drafting brought toJicht substantial difficulties.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the President of the Board ofTrade as set forth in CP.  312 (37)and summarised above-

SecondReading.    The present Bill proposed to bring the lawas to the grounds of divorce in Scotland into conform-ity with that now in operation in England. TheSecretary of State suggested that in the event of theBill being, given a Second Reading in the House ofCommons, the Government should  co-operate in theproceedings in Committee by explaining its provisions and their consequences, and generally in securing thatit remained in a form suitable for inclusion in theStatute Book;    also that, following the cabinet decision in the ease of the English Bill of last session, Government time should, if necessary, bema.de available for its regaining stages .The Lord Chancellor hoped that the Cabinet wouldnot agree to give Government time for the remaining stages of the Bill.      That had not been promised inthe case of the corresponding English Bill,The Secretary of&quot; State for Scotland said he was prepared to leave that issue to the future, as itcould not arise for some time to come0The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for scotland as set forth in CP.  311 (37)and summarised above.
