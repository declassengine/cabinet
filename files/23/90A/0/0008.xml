parliamentary procedure.Privs t eNoticeqjuest ions .(previous reference:Cabinet 25(7,4), Con-clusion 8.)1, The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet, andmore particularly those who were Members of the House ofCommons, that trouble had arisen on the previous day inthat House out of a Private Notice Question a-d^ressec&quot; tothe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries by a supporterof the Government .    The Opposition had protested thatthey ought to have ^een notified..   He had made enquiryan* had ascertained, that, there was a  custom that wherePrivate Notice Questions affected policy they should beput. by the Leader of the. Opposition.   As a matter of fact the Private Notice Oue^tion put. on the previous day hadnot raised a question of policy, but the statement madein reply ha75 appeared important to the House, and the speaker had used the word  &quot;policy&quot;.    Consequently he asked his colleagues, if they had subjects which they wished raised in the form of Private Notice Questions,to consult the Parliamentary Secretary to the treasury as to whether it was a. matter which the Leader of theOpposition should be asked to raise.This was agreed to, on the understandingthat it did not affect Questions on the order paper.-1-
GERMANY&quot; AND 2.     The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTfALY.  informed the Cabinet that since the last Meeting heTnternalPosition in.   had had a conversation with the German Ambassador and.Qhad civen much information to Am.bassa.dors of other(previous reference:      countries about the Lord Presidents  conversations in cabinet 45(37), Con-     Germany, as well as about the Anglo-French conversa-clusion 5.)tions.FR.30(jh^)u..        ^e reported that the Foreign Office had. receiveda number of reports from different sources giving an account of internal difficulties both in Germany andItaly.    The Germans appeared to be very much aware ofthe Italian difficulties.    The difficulties referred towe^e mainly of an economic and financial character.This was a factor to be borne in mind.2ft!V.
SPAIN. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Non-intervention Committee had met on(previous reference:     ^he previous day and had decide^ that the answersOahinet 45(37), Con-     received from the two parties to the struggle in Spainclus ion 1.)justified proceeding with the work of preparing the commissions to be sen1: to Spain.    No doubt there were difficulties still to be surmounted, but the Earl ofPlymouth had advised him that if matters went wellit might be possible to send the Commissions by the endof January.    The financial aspect of the Commissions hadrather disturbed him, but this did not arise at themoment as there was sufficient money available to makea start.
THE PAR EAST. 4, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsjapan and reported that the Chinese armies were faring badly and,China.so far as the information at the disposal of the Foreign(previous Office went, their military position appeared fairlyReference:Cabinet 45 desperate, there was a possibility that General Chiang-(37), Con-clusion 2.)     Vai-Shek might resign and leave it to someone else tomake peace.   He was unlikely to make peace himself.   Atthe moment the situation at Shanghai appeared to be alittle better, but he did not want to encourage too muchoptimism.Tn reply to the Minister for Co-orJination ofDefence, who had drawn attention to the use of languageby the British Cha-rge d&apos;Affaires at Nanking capable ofbeing interpreted as an encouragement to China, to resist,the Foreign Secretary expressed the view that theOfficial in question had been very cautious.    He report-ed information to the effect that the Germans had putforward so&quot;-e rather stiff proposals to the ChineseGovernment, which ha.d been rejected.    There seemed to bea. possibility that the war might end. by direct negotia-tions .
PALESTINE.government policy .(previous reference:Cabinet 44(37), Con-elusion 10 .)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on thesubject of Government Policy in Palestine, and. hadb e f0 re th em th e fo11ow ing do cume nt s: -A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (CP.-2S9 (37)) recommend-ing that, even if the co-operation of Jewsor Arabs is not forthcoming, the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government should be &quot;to pro-ceed neverthelesscountry&quot;with the pe.rtit.ion of theA Memorandum by the Secretary of Stete forForeign Affairs (CP.-281 (37))  commenting on the above Paper and pointing out the grave difficulties and. dangers likely to follow if his Majesty&apos;s Government committed themselvesforthwith to a policy of enforced partition:A further Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies ( CP.-289 (37))replying to the criticisms contained, in cp.-281 (37):    pointing out the consequences of withdrawal from the policy to which theGovernment were committed;    and attachinga revised draft of the proposed despatch to Pa.lestine, the terms of which would, he hoped, receive the concurrence of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos;A further Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-29^ (37),furnished in accordance with the conclusion mentioned in the margin, on the provablereactions of foreign Jews to any n?.oJifiea-tion of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment in reeard to Palestine:An additional Memorandum by the Secretaryof-State for the Colonies *CP.-286 (37))circulating for information an importantletter from the Acting High Commissionerdealing with the local situation inPalestine.The Prime Minister, after recalling the recenthistory of this question, said that he thought it might-facilitate discussion if he adopted, the course of statinghis own views first.The Cabinet were faced with a very difficult and.anxious situation,   on which it was not easy to reach a decision.    He was  conscious of the dangers which had.presented themselves to the mind Qf the Foreign Secretarylest our policy in Palestine should present Italy witha further opportunity to make mischief by means of
propaganda,.   The Middle East was a particularly fruitfulfield for such methods.    Tn that region we had. had good.friends in the past, and. he was especially anxious notto expose them to the dangers of propaganda.   this applied, particularly in the case if ibn  Saud, whose attitude had been perfectly sound and straightforward..He did not wish that Ton Saud should form a lower opinionof us than he had held in the past.   At the same time,any policy was likely to involve us in difficulties.No policy would please everyone, and. it was douhtful if by partition we eoul&apos;&apos; give much satisfaction even tothe Jews, at any rate without antagonising the Arabs.His first point was that even if we were to assume thateventually a. policy ot* partition wa.s too difficult, forus to carry,  the present moment, was not a good one forannouncing it.    ^o do so now would be premature.    Theevidence available to the world was as yet not sufficientto ca^ry conviction that, partition was impracticable.Consequently if the Government were to make such anannouncement it would be criticised for having surrendered to threats and force.   More especially, it would muchembarrass people who had brought tnemselves with diffi-culty to accept the policy.    .Ve had not, in his view,yet reached a point where we could, say that it would befolly to go on with the policy of partition.He then drew attention to the following words in para. 17 of *he Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (C.P.-289 (37)):-&quot;The work of the ne-w Commission will undoubt-edly occupy many months.    They will be unableto complete their report until they are inpossession of the data which will be supplied by the hydrographic and other surveys andinquiries which have recently been put inhand by the Palestine Government.    When theirreport, is received, and. assuming that the .Commission have been able to devise an equitable and practicable scheme, a decision must be further delayed pending reference toParliament and to the League of Nations  .........There is, therefore, no question of immediate action to carry out. partition&quot;.
He thought that that might he put even more strongly.There could he no policy of immediate action for morethan a year. (The Colonial Secretary interpolated &quot;Threeyears&quot; ,)    If the time required fo^ these processes could he made public, the dangers of repercussions  to theannouncement o^ the proposed Commission should be reducedboth inside and outside Palestine.   &quot;He would, thereforelike to proceed with sending the Commission, but at thes^me time to make a public statement that no action couldbe taken for ? long time to come to set up the proposedindependent States.   He would like the Commission to be instructed to produce an equitable scheme.   But the Termsof Reference might be so worded thai the Commission wouldnot be debarred, from saying that if partition was totake place, this or that solution was the best, but. thatin their view no workable scheme coul^ be produced,He did not s*^y that the Commission would say that, buthe would not like to close the door to their being ableto sfly it.    In any event they might Say something of thekind, which would be a valuable guide to public opinion.Even from the point o^ view of foreign policy the coursehe proposed, need not anta.gonise the Arah States!    neithernee* it  exclude the possibility of a change of policy ifthe Commission showed partition to be unworkable.On the other hand, it would not involve reversing thepolicy of partition unless public opinion realised thatthis was unavoidable.There was one other point.    It had been suggested,in the Memorandum by the Foreign Secretary thai, some ofthe Arab inhabitants of the Jewish zone might have to beremove^ forcibly into the Arab zone.   He had ascertained from the Colonial Secretary that, he ha^ no such intention.He suggested that that might be announced at the sametime as the Despatch was published.-7-
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thankedthe Colonial Secretary for the careful considerationhe had given to his Memorandum.    He did not wish to repeat the arguments set forth therein.    From theForeign Office point of view the Colonial Secretary&apos;sin-original proposals were very/convenient.    Without this difficulty over Palestine he was able to view the wholeof the Middle East, as being in a. peaceful  con-it ion.He had not a.sked that we should announce to the worldnow t hat partition wouldn&apos;t &apos;t vark and that the policy mustbe changed.   He agreed that this would be unwise.    Puthe wanted to make clear that we did not intend toenforce partition irrespective of the opposition offered to it.   He would have   some suggestions to make for amending the dra^t Despatch attached to CP.-289 (37)).^he Terms of Reference would not enable the Commissionto hear opjnions to the effect that part.iM.on wasunworkable, or to say so themselves.    If, as proposed.by the Prime Minister, the Terms of Reference weremodified in that respect it would go a long way to meet&quot;his anxieties.   He would also welcome a. statement thatforcible remova.1 of the Arab population would, not takepi a ce ,The Secretary of State for India said that he wasnot blind to the advantages claimed for announcing apolicy 0* going on with parti4- ion even if both parties in Palestine rejected it.    He realised that this wouldhave, the advantage of allaying uncertainty.    It wasnecessary, however, also to consider the foreign secretary&apos;s views, which were very similar to his own.Evidence was  constantly reaching him of the strong feeling in Arab countries against partition.   He read to his  colleagues an account of a. private conversation
between Ibn Saud and Colonel Dixon, a retired Official.ibn  Saud had spoken of *he traditional friendship betweenthe Arabs and this country, as well as of his personalfriendship, and had asked why all this pother should beraised over &quot;an accursed, race&quot;.    Ton Saud&apos;s proposedsolution had been that the United, &quot;kingdom should makePalestine a. British Possession and rule it for a hundred years.    This suggestion coincided with one that had beenmade to him by the Aga Khan, who h^d received representatives-sent a-tions on the subject from various Eastern nations atGeneva.   For example, the representatives of Iraq andIran had suggesteft that for the United Kingdom to acceptPalestine a.s a Crown Colony and. gradually introducerepresentative government there would be preferable topartition.    mhe Aga Than had disagreed with the Secretaryof State&apos;s suggestion that .this was an impracticablepolicy, and had told him that. Geneva, would be prepared toaccept it.   Agitation among Moslems in India againstpartition was steadily increasing.   Unfortunately adeputation was being sent to Palestine from the All-IndiaMoslem League, which would include certain extremistsv/ho had been concerned with the Thilafat agitation duringthe .Var, some of whom had been put in prison in thatconnection.   .!n addition, the President of the All-IndiaLeague had made a. statement a. few days ago to the effect-that unless the difficulties in Palestine were fairly and.squarely met it would be a turning-point in the futureof the British Expire.   He himself was accustomed to theviolent statements of Indians in controversy, but he didnot wish to give further opportunities for such agitation.If a &quot;Despatch were to be issued, in the terms of the draft attached, to CP.-289 (37) and we were to announce thatwe were going to enforce partition, it would create avery difficult situation in India.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthe Despatch die1 not go so far as this.The Secretary of State for India proposed thatparagraphs 5 and 7 of the draft Despatch should beomitt ed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported thisproposal .   He also thought that the announcement shouldbe limited to what the Commission was to investigateand that it should not go on to say what we should do invarious hypotheses .The Prime Minister said that the proposals of theSecretary of State for India and the Chancellor of theExchequer -.-ere intended to ^e implicit in his suggestion.The Lord President of the Council said that his impression after listening to the discussion was thai,while all who had spoken were prepared to support thepolicy of partition for the present,  everything must depend upon whether an equitable and practicable scheme could be evolved .   He thought, it should be possible tosay this in much shorter words than in the Despatch.The Home Secretary agreed.   He saw real difficul-ties, however, from an administrative point of view.He admitted that in India we could not afford to alienateMoslem opinion.    He recalled, however, the difficulties over ^he maintenance of order in Bengal a few years ago,which had arisen largely from a. lack of policy.    these difficulties had been overcome partly by the ability ofthe Governor, but. mainly because the Government had a clear policy.    It was just, the same in Palestine.   until there was a. definite policy the administrative difficul-ties would  continue.    All depended, therefore, on theterms of the Despatch.   On the one hand it was necessarythat the Government should not. be tied up more closely to the policy of partition than at present:    on the
other hand, it was essential not to give an impression of vagueness.The Secretary of State for Scotland pointed outthat the question was important from the point of viewof public opinion in the country and in Parliament.    Hesuggested that, paragraph 2 of the draft Despatch appended to CP.-289 (37) was a vital one, viz.:-&quot;Tn the first place, T desire to make itclear that the resolutions mentioned aboveinvolve no modification of the policyexpressed in the Command Paper.    That policystill stands, and, as a. result of the dis-eussions at Geneva, His Majesty&apos;s government now feel justified in undertaking the invest-igations required for the preparation of amore carefully considered scheme of partition&quot;.He recalled that it had been made clear by british representatives at Geneva that only by means of partition -could, our obligations be satisfied .    Anyone readingparagraph 2 would -feel no doubt as to what was the policyof His Majest;/*s Government.    To reverse that would be rather a sharp change of policy.   He felt that there was more than drafting in this question.    If partition did.not stand, we should be in a position of great difficulty.He thought, there-fore, that our position should be made very clear.   Hnless we made quite clear th*t part of theterritory of Palestine was to be kept open for jewish immigration we should not solve our difficulties.mhe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thatit ought to be made clear whether we intended to enforcepartition.   He drew attention to the following passage from paragraph 14 of the Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies ( CP.-289 (37)):-&quot;I hope that. I have succeeded in making itclear that, in the light of recent, events   -and. if the Arab attitude remains unchanged,the only alternative to enforcing some formof partition will be to inform the Jewsthat we cannot carry out our obligationson account of Arab opposition.&quot;That, presented e dilemma.    If he himself were a memberof the Commission he would want to know the mind, o^ the
Government on this point.   He Aid not want necessarilyto put the point in the Despatch, but the Cabinet oughtto know its own mind on the subject.The Prime Minister suggested that, this point couldbe got over by a personal  communication to the Chairmanof the Commission.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs thought that there was no ideal solution.   He could notclose his eyes to the Foreign secretary view as tothe trouble which partition was creating throughout theArab world .    It might, be that in view of this development  though it was no- an unexpected one   we ought toproceed cautiously.    He personally, however, would takea lot of convincing that partition was not the least objectionable solution.    There was no other solutionthat met. the Arab difficulties as well as those of theJews.   Any change of this policy would create a stormagainst the Government.   He recalled that even pro-ArabM.P.&apos;s ha.&apos;&apos; supported partition.   A change of policy wouldalso create -great dife^cuities at Geneva, more par^ieu-larly as the Mandates. Commission was inclined to bepro-Zionist.    We should be accused of vacillation andweakness.    Nevertheless he agreed that it was necessaryto proceed  cautiously.    He woul^ not give an impression of running away from partition, but would lea.ve the dooropen to the Commission which was to examine possibleschemes of partition to sa.y if it found it impossible to devise one.   He woul^, however, leave the door open onlya very lit tie.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that more ought to be done to bring ibn  Saud. to understand the extent of our commitments in Palestine.    If this could be done he mi^ht be willing to adopt a reasonable attitude towards his own claims to Akaba.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thathe would do his best to meet the views of his colleagues in re-dra^tine the Despatch.   He would be glad toreceive any suggestions o^ detail, which he would con-sider very carefully.   He dreir special attention to thepoint made by the ^ome Secretary,   Ne himself had toexercise the utmost  c^re not to take a. course which would let down our representatives in Palestine, who were working in great difficulties.     At present, there weredoubts as to whether we intended, to persist with parti-tion.    This was partly due to a recent speech in Baghdadby Nuri Pasha, which he quoted, and which gave him theimpression that Nuri had somehow or other sot news of the fresh consideration that was being given to the matter.All he wanted was an objective Commission to work out. a plan.    We must avoid a roving Commission.   What theGovernment wanted was to be informed of a. plan to enablethem to ca.rry out the policy of pa^ti+ion.   Any idea of running away from that policy at the present time wasimpra cti cable.Referring to Italian propaganda, he said that heha.d received information from French sources that it wasnot having very much effect .    Ibn Saud was a xenophobe,though making an exception in the case of Great Britain.He suggested, therefore, that our diplomatic representa.-tives in the Near ^ast ought to be informed as to thepolicy o^ the Government and instructed to help to getthat policy understood and accepted.   He himself agreed with the Secre+ary of State for Dominion Affairs thatthe only ultimate solution was some form of partition.He could see none other.He thought that we had not paid sufficient atten-tion to our own strategic desiderata..    Prom. a. strategicalpoint, of view we ought permanently to retain Jerusalem,Haifa an&quot; Akaha.   We could, not let the Arabs have these.
In order to do that we must escape from our presentMandate and create a new situation at Geneva.   Palestine,he added, was in a unique position in the world. No-one could be allowed to have a monopoly there.   We must noton any account give the impression that we were runningaway.    Tt was, however, not necessary to suggest that we intended to enforce the removal of the Arab population from the Jewish zone.    So far as partition was concernedhe wished to secure the acceptance of the principle.The Jews and Arabs would only accept it if they saw thatthere was no alternative or that the only alternative was a worse one.   He advocated, therefore, that theDespatch should be re-drafted and. that we should make clear that we intended to continue the policy of parti-tion and could, see no alternative:   but it must be donein such a way as to leave the door open for the Commis-sion to say, if necessary, that a workable plan couldnot be devised.The Prime Minister said that he had received aletter from the Secretary of State for Air, who was absent on duty with the ^ing, and who had expressed,the hope that in any despatch or announcement of thenew Commission we should not &quot;burn our how.ts&quot;.   Lord.Swinton hoped, therefore^ that it would not be thought necessary in any despatch to include the last twosentences of paragraph 6 or paragraph 7 of the draft-Despatch attached to CP.-289 (37),    In addition, hehad expressed the hope that no final decision would betaken until the Chiefs of Staff had had an opportunityof reporting.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence asked the Cabinet to take a decision as to whether the Chiefsof Staff should, proceed.   He had  communicated to them*he various Papers prepared ^or this Meeting of theCabinet.
The Prime Minister considered that it was unneces-sary to trouble the Chiefs of Staff at the moment.    Itwould, very likely be necessary to consult them later on,more particularly (as suggested, by the Colonial Zeore-tary) on our strategic desiderata in any settlement.The Chiefs of Staff, however, should await a. separatedirect ion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should re-draft the Despatch attached as appendix II to CP.-289 (37) in the light ofthe Cabinet discussion as summarised above,a.nd that he should be asked to consult thefollowing Ministers:-The Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home S e cr e tary,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for India:(b) That the re-draft of the Despatch should omit the last two sentences of paragraph 5 and.the whole of paragraph 7 of the draft attached as Appendix II to CP.-289 (37):( c) That members of the Cabinet who had any detailed suggestions to make for amendmentof the draft Despatch should, forward themto the Secretary of State for the Colonies:(d) That the revised Despatch should be submitted,for the approval of the Cabinet:(e) That, an announcement should be ma.de (whether in the revised draft. Despatch or otherwise)that under the policy of partition theGovernment had no intention of enforcing themovement of Arabs from the Jewish to theA.ra.b zone:( f) That, a public statement should be made onan appropriate occasion pointing out the time that must elapse before partition could been forced:(g) That if it was deemed necessary to informthe Commission that it was open to them torepresent that, no scheme of partition that,they could devise was likely to prove work-able, this should be done by means of a.personal communication to the Chairman:(h) That, for the present it was unnecessary forthe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to be instructed to report on Palestine, and thatif, as was possible, a. Report was requiredlater, e.g.., on our strategic desiderata, ina settlement, specific directions would begiven to them.

He mentioned, also that wider aspects o^ the statutory regulation of wages werearising in connection with a number of other industries.Important discussions were taking place, and he thoughtthat the line that ought to be taken should be to say,if pressed to ^ake a statement, that the Governmentwould not delay taking, such action as might be necessary,as a. result of agreement between representative groups of employers and workpeople, for the establishment of appropriate machinery in these industries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat the proposed Bill would involve a considerableextension of Government interference in various industries which would require very careful attention when the Bill came under consideration.The Prime Minister thanked the Ministerof Labour for bringing the last paragraph of his memorandum to the attention of the Cabinet, namely -&quot;At the recent annual meeting of the TradesUnion Congress a resolution was passedwelcoming the action of the Minister ofLabour in inaugurating the discussions inthe distributive trades.     Similar dis-cussions have just commenced in the bakingI industry following the issue of the AlnessReport on Night Baking, and other discussionswill shortly be taking place in the cateringtrades, the rubber manufacturing industry,and the cinema industry.   .  These discussions
are very important and the line I think we ought to take - and I should he glad to know that my colleagues agree - is tosay, if pressed to make a statement,that the Government will not delay taking such action as may he necessary, as aresult of agreement between representativegroups of employers and workpeople, forthe establishment of appropriate machinery in these industries.&quot;He thought it probable that if the discussions wereto be extended to the trades mentioned, it would notbe possible to confine them to those particulartrades.     He considered it might be better to saythat each case would be taken on its merits.The President of the Board of Trade said he gathered that, as regards &quot;C&quot; licences, for the moment the Minister of Labour was only pursuing enquiries andthat the Cabinet would have a further opportunity for considering the principle involved when the Billcame before them.      He himself, however, had beena member of the Cabinet when the proposals of theSalter Committee had been rejected on the grounds that it was unworkable.     He thought that the last paragraph of the Minister of Labour&apos;s memorandum(quoted above) went rather far if the Governmentwere to be committed thereby to give an undertaking that they would take action in any case where thereis an agreement between representative groups ofemployers and workpeople.      It was true that procedure of this kind had worked in the case of the cottonindustry, but that was due to the fact that the cottonindustry was on a geographical basis.     He doubted if it could be implied in the case of the cinemaindustry, for example.     He asked, therefore, that theCabinet should not be committed to do more than consider any such case on its merits.
The Minister of Labour pointed out that muchhad happened since the previous decision of the cabinet referred to by the President of the Board of Trade,especially in the transport industry,,The Minister of Transport supported theproposals of the Minister of Labour.     He pointed outthat this was a matter which was the primary concern of the Minister of Labour and not the Minister of Transport.Nevertheless, he warned the Cabinet that he would probablybe coming to them before long for complementarylegislation on the subject of rates of charge for thetransport of goods by road.The Prime Minister pointed out that the&quot;C&quot; licences would be dealt with in a Bill.     The cabinet would have an opportunity to consider the question ofprinciple when it came before them.     He suggested thatthe Minister of Labour might accept something less thanhis present proposals in paragraph 14.The Minister of Labour expressed his willingness to accept the proposal that each case should be considered on its merits.The Lord Chancellor pointed out that the Billproposed by the Minister of Labour would eome, in thefirst instance, before the Committee of Home Affairs,which was not an appropriate body for the discussion ofa large question of principle,,     He hoped, therefore,that the Cabinet would decide the question of principlebefore it came before the Committee of Home Affairs.This was accepted.The Cabinet agreed:(a)    That the Minister of Labour should have authority, in conjunction with theMinister of Transport, to prepare aBill with the object of setting up new machinery for the regulation of wagesand conditions of service of driversand attendants of vehicles in the roadmotor transport industry (goods) on thelines indicated in his memorandum(CP.  293 (37)):- 23. -
(b) That the Bill, when completed,should be considered, in the firstinstance, by the Cabinet, who should decide any question ofprinciple involved, for example, thecase of &quot;CH licences before it was examined in detail by the Committeeof Home Affairs:(c) That, in connection with the wider aspects of the statutory regulationof wages referred to in paragraph 14of CP. 293 (37), the Minister ofLabour, if pressed to make astatement, should say that the Govern-ment will, in each case, consider onits merits the establishment of appropriate machinery asked for asa result of agreement betweenrepresentative groups of employersand workpeople*

In paragraph 42 theyhad expressed the warnings referred to inconclusion (i)(a) above     From this paragraph, hequoted the following extracts:-&quot;From the above Report it will be seen thatour Naval, Military and Air Forces, in theirk present stage of development are still farfrom sufficient to meet our defensivecommitments, which now extend from western europe through the Mediterranean to the far east o0.o. Without overlooking the
assistance which we should hope to obtain from France, and possibly other allies, we cannotforesee the time when our defence forces willbe strong enough to safeguard our territory,trade and vital interests against Germany,Italy and Japan simultaneously.     We cannot,therefore, exaggerate the importance, from thepoint of view of Imperial defence, of any political or international action that can betaken to reduce the numbers of our potentialenemies and to gain the support of potentialallies.&quot;The Foreign Secretary, the Prime Ministercontinued, had circulated a short paper to the Committee ofImperial Defence dealing with certain aspects of the Chiefsof Staff paper but not pretending to give any general account of our foreign policy.     At the meeting of theCommittee, however, the Foreign Secretary had made a verbalstatement, the general effect of which had been summarised in conclusion (i)(b).     He then summarised the main considerations that had been brought to the notice of theCommittee.      It was true, as the Chiefs of Staff had pointedout, that we could not hope to confront satisfactorilyGermany, Italy and Japan simultaneously and, when we lookedround as to what help we could get from other nations, theresults were not very encouraging.     France was our mostimportant friend.      Though she was strong defensively andpossessed a powerful army,  the French Air Force was far fromsatisfactory.     During the Anglo-French visit, M. Chautempshad admitted to an output of aircraft that was only about one-fifth (60-300) of our own.     A long time must elapse beforeFrance would be able to give us much help in the air.The Power that had the greatest strength was the UnitedStates of America, but he would be a rash man who basedhis calculations on help from that quarter.     Our positionin relation to the smaller Powers was much better thanformerly, but he did not think that they would add muchto our offensive or defensive strength.     In time of peace
their support was useful,hut in war less so.     The Chiefsof Staff, as he had mentioned, said they could not foreseethe time when our defence forces would he strong enoughto safeguard our territory, trade and vital interestsagainst Germany, Italy and Japan simultaneously.      Theyhad urged that our foreign policy must he governed by this consideration, and they had made rather a strong appealto this effect.      Of course, it would he possible to make an effort to detach one of the three Powers from the other two and it might even succeed.      This, however, could onlybe done at the cost of concessions which would involvehumiliations and disadvantages to this country bydestroying the confidence of other nations.     No-one would suppose,  therefore, that we should try and bribeone of the three nations to leave the other two.     Whatthe Foreign Secretary was doing was to try and prevent a situation arising in which the three Powers mentionedwould ever be at war with us.      He recalled that beforethe trouble had arisen in the Far East, we had been making-great efforts to improve our z*elations with Japan andthat considerable progress had been made0     Owing to recent events, we had been compelled to break off these negotiations, but we had tried to keep open the position ofresuming them later on.     We had avoided threats ourselves and had restrained others from making them.      Theimprovement in relations with Italy was not easy, but wehad made some efforts to get on better terms, in spite ofthe difficult attitude of Mussolini and we were about tomake a further effort at that end of the Berlin-Rome Axis.As he himself had pointed out before, however, germany was the real key to the question.    In view of the recentconsideration given by the Cabinet to the question of improving relations with Germany, it was unnecessary to
develop that theme any further.     He thought, however,that he had said enough to show that the strategic considerations urged by the Chiefs of Staff were fullytaken into account in our foreign policy and that was what underlay the taking note by the Committee of ImperialDefence of conclusion (i)(b) quoted above, namely -&quot;(b)    The statement on foreign policy madeat this meeting by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, which, itwas agreed, takes proper account ofthe facts of the situation, including those mentioned in the Report by theChiefs of Staff.&quot;In the course of a short discussion, attention was drawn to the late Prime Minister&apos;s undertaking as tothe maintenance of parity between the Air Force of theUnited Kingdom and that of Germany.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence pointed out that Lord Baldwin&apos;s statement requiredinterpretation.     He had never taken it to mean that wemust have exactly the same number of fighters and bombersas Germany in order to carry out the contemplated equality.-   The Prime Minister said he did not intend to repeat Lord Baldwin1s words and, if the question were raised,he would make it clear that the Government did not considerit necessary to have precise equality in every class of aircraft.     It might be necessary to make a statement onthis subject before very long.After some further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:To take note of the Report contained in cp. 296 (37), together with the PrimeMinister&apos;s remarks thereon and summarised above.

The Cabinet had under consideration the Hire-Purchase Bill, introduced in the House of Commons by aPrivate Member and down for Second Reading on Friday,10th Decerrber, 1937:    together with a Memorandum bythe Lord. Chancellor ^C.P.-294 (37)) in which he0- suggested, that, for reasons set forth therein, the LawOfficers should have authority to admit the necessityfor some legislation on this subject and. to expresssympathy with the objects of the Bill and the efforts of the promoters to reach agreement, while indicating that the Eill might require very careful examinationfrom the technical point of view.   One possible course might be to assent to the Second Reading on the condi-tion that the Bill would be sent to a Joint SelectCommittee of both Houses, not with the idea of killingthe Bill, but. with a view to ensuring that all legiti-mate interests had received full consideration and that the provisions of the Bill were technically right.After a preliminary statement by the LordChancellor introducing his memorandum, the PrimeMinister said that the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury agreed that the Bill should not be opposedand it should be treated sympathetically by the LawOfficers, but he did not like the idea of a JointCommittee and preferred that the Bill should go to a standing Committee.The President of the Board of Trade attached importance to a Joint Committee of both Houses,     he pointed out that,under the normal procedure, pillsof this kind were apt to pass through Committee beforesome of the interests affected realised that they were concerned.     That might easily happen in the presentoaee, and he thought a Joint Select Committee of bothHouses would be preferable.
The Prime Minister thought it would be best to leave the question open for the moment and for thePresident of the Board of Trade to discuss it withthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.The Secretary of State for Scotland pointedout that the Bill under consideration went much further than the Scottish Act,     He reported that thenumber of persons imprisoned in Scotland for failure to deliver up furniture, gramophones, cycles, etc.,obtained on the hire purchase system and, since July,1932,under the Hire Purchase and Small Debt (Scotland) Act,1932, was illustrated by the following figures:-1929 - 2651936   -       8These figures were evidence that the Act of 1932 had had a beneficial result.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Hire Purchase Billshould not be opposed and thatthe Law Officers should have authority, to admit the necessityfor some legislation on thissubject, and to express sympathy with the objects of the bill and the efforts of the promotersto reach agreement, whileindicating that the Bill might require very careful examinationfrom the technical point of view:(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should discuss with theParliamentary Secretary to theTreasury the question of whetherthe Bill should be sent to a joint select Committee of both Houses orto the appropriate StandingCommittee of the House of Commons,

Paper No. 1369-B.)RErORT by the chiefs of staff sub-committee.Part I. Introduction.IN accordance with the 301st Meeting* of the Committee of Imperial Defencewe have had under consideration as a matter of urgency a despatch dated the3rd November, 1937, and telegram dated the 12th November, 1937, from SirMiles Lampson to the Foreign Office, a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, to the Admiralty dated the 15th November, 1937, and a letterfrom the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt to the War Officedated the 28th October, 1937, dealing with the question of the defence of Egypt.The despatch and telegrams are attached to this Report as Appendices I-IV.2. The terms of reference remitted to us by the Committee of ImperialDefence are as follows : (i) Irrespective of the probability or otherwise of an Italian threat to egypt in the near future, to consider and report on the precise measureswhich it would be possible to take to meet the demands summarised in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No. 635 of the 13th November, irrespective-tive, in the first instance, of any question either of their reactions onour position vis-a-vis Germany, or of their being liable to be construedby the Italians as provocative,(ii) To indicate the effect which the adoption of each of the measures inquestion would have on our position vis-a-vis Germany.3. Before dealing in detail with the pi&apos;proposals put forward by the british ambassador in Cairo, the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and the GeneralOfficer Commanding British Troops in Egypt for augmenting our strength inEgypt and the Middle East, we have certain preliminary observations of a generalnature to make.[16196]   [16277]* Minute 3.b
4. It is clear that Sir Allies Lampson takes a serious view, which is alsoshared by the Egyptian authorities, of the possibility of Italian aggression against Egypt and the means at present available to defend that country againsta sudden attack. While we do not wish to belittle the anxieties which we onour part feel regarding our general strength in the Middle East at the presenttime in the light of the strengthening of the Italian garrison in Libya and anti-British propaganda which has for some time been prevalent in the Middle Eastgenerally, we think that the Ambassadors apprehensions are, of necessity, basedlargely on the purely local outlook. In examining his proposals we have also totake into consideration our commitments in other parts of the world and themeans at our disposal to meet them. Moreover, viewing the position from theItalian point of view, while Italy&apos;s local position in the Central and eastern mediterranean is at the moment relatively strong, her general strategic positionremains inherently weak.5. We are informed that there is a tendency on the part of the egyptian authorities to question the determination of His Majesty&apos;s Government to face the realities of the defence situation in Egypt and to carry out our obligations to assist, to the full measure of our ability, in the defence of that country againstItalian aggression. We feel that it is important that this tendency should be checked as soon as possible, and that apart from any verbal reassurance whichmay be communicated to the Egyptian authorities, the best means of ensuring a continuation of their confidence in His Majesty&apos;s Governments competence tomeet a threat from Italy would be by strengthening our military position in egypt in no mistakable manner.6. Apart from this we have a moral responsibility for the defence of Egypt,a country which, to suit our own interests, we have kept virtually disarmed for thelast 50 years. Moreover, there is an added clanger that if we fail to retain theconfidence of the Egyptian Government, the latter may become readily susceptible to Italian influences and this would greatly increase our difficulties.7. We now turn to the more detailed points raised in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;despatch and telegram, and in the telegrams from the Commander-in-chief,Mediterranean, and the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt.Part II. The Extent to which it would be possible to meet the proposals put forward in appendices 1 to 4. irrespective of any other considerations.Defence against Air Attack.8. We now turn to an examination of the specific proposals put forward inthe Appendices to this Report with a view to determining the extent to whichthey can be met, irrespective of any other considerations.In paragraphs 11 and 12 of his despatch (Appendix II), Sir Miles Lampson^draws attention to the psychological effect which modern warfare may have onthe volatile and hysterical Egyptian population, and the possibility of panic withall its implications in the face of a heavy scale of Italian air attack, and in theabsence of any anti-aircraft defence. We fully concur in the Ambassadors viewson this point, and, as we show later, the immediate despatch of one anti-aircraftbrigade and one anti-aircraft searchlight company (24 anti-aircraft guns and24 searchlights) to Egypt would be possible under our present terms of reference and without regard to our commitments elsewhere. If it should be decided thatthe despatch of these guns and lights is unacceptable without some compensatingmeasure for making good the deficiency from our total strength at home,consideration might be given to taking over temporarily from the Admiralty, and using for Home defence, certain 3-inch anti-aircraft guns allocated to merchantvessels. These guns are at present not provided with control arrangements, nor could they at present be employed in a mobile role. They are in fact of very lowfighting value. The possibility of their use at home, will, however, be investigated.9. It was suggested at the last meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence* that, if we were unable to despatch modern anti-aircraft units to Egypt,it might be possible to send some old anti-aircraft guns and searchlights and to* C.I.D. 301st Meeting, Minute 3.
organise a force of Egyptians locally to man them. It might, therefore, be argued that the above naval anti-aircraft guns could be despatched to Egypt, as thiswould obviate the necessity for reducing the strength of our regular anti-aircraftformations at home. We are strongly opposed to this step, since the Egyptiansare highly sensitive on the question of obsolescent equipment. Moreover, anyimprovisation required to render these equipments suitable for use on land couldmore easily be carried out in this country than in Egypt.10. The internal security question in Egypt in the event of war would, as sir Miles Lampson points out, undoubtedly present a difficult problem. Theexisting garrison is insufficient to meet this commitment. There is a large Britishpopulation in Cairo, and it would be necessary to keep in cheek the considerableItalian population which at present exists in Egypt (approximately 60,000).There are no British troops in Cairo under the existing defence plan, and thereis only one British battalion at Alexandria, which constitutes the sole reserveavailable under the hand of the General Officer Commanding British Troops inEgypt. It should be noted, however, that under the terms of the Anglo-egyptian treaty we are no longer responsible in peace for the internal security of Egypt.Surprise Attack on. Mersa Matruh.11. In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his despatch (Appendix II) Sir Miles Lampsonrefers to the probability of a sudden Italian attack developing againstMersa Matruh. We hope that we should receive some notice of an intention bythe Italians to carry out prolonged operations in the Western Desert, as these would necessitate the building-up of considerable reserves of supplies of all kinds.Nevertheless, we agree that the existence of mobile forces in Libya enables theItalians to stage a sudden raid against Mersa Matruh. It is of the greatest importance for the defence of Egypt that Mersa Matruh should be held. We are.therefore, in agreement with the Ambassadors proposal that the General OfficerCommanding British Troops in Egypt should be given authority to move certain british units at his discretion to Mersa Matruh, but we suggest that this authority should only be exercised in case of emergency and not in normal times as suggestedby the Ambassador.A ir Raid Precautions.12. In paragraph 13 of his despatch (Appendix II) Sir Miles Lampsonurges that His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake the provision of gas masksfor the whole British civilian community. Although this question is not strictlywithin our province, we recommend that since the stocks of gas masks for our ownpopulation in the United Kingdom are now nearing completion, consideration should be given to offering the Egyptian Government a certain number of gasmasks on repayment for both the British and Egyptian civil population.Gun defences for the Suez Canal.13. We note that in paragraph 15 of the despatch (Appendix II) theEgyptian Prime Minister has raised the question of the defences of the Canal, andis anxious to provide coast defences at Port Said and Suez. While welcominghis intentions in this respect, we foresee the possibility that the installation of guns in peace time for the defence of the Canal might give rise to friction betweenthe Egyptian and the Italian Governments, and lead to undesirable discussion as to the interpretation of the Suez Canal Convention. We therefore suggestthat Nahas Pasha should be encouraged to prepare the concrete gun platformsat Suez and Port Said, and to store the necessary gun and searchlight equipmentsin the vicinity of those ports. It should then be possible to install the defencesrapidly in the event of an emergency. We also consider that the question of the canal defences can now be^diseussed freely with the Egyptian Prime Minister,since he has raised the question, without the need of disclosing the details of the suez Canal Defence Plan.Formation of an Egyptian Navy.14.   In paragraph 16 of the despatch (Appendix II) a proposal is putforward that the Egyptian Government should be advised to form a Navy.   Asa long-term project we see every advantage in this proposal, and suggest that[16196] &apos; b 2
the Admiralty should take up this question with a view to implementing it. Theformation of a minesweeper force on the lines proposed would, however, take aconsiderable time, and we do not therefore regard it as one of the immediate measures which could be taken at the present time to improve our defensiveposition in Egypt.15. As regards moving four minesweepers to Alexandria, these could beused for training Egyptian crews, pending the arrival of Egyptian minesweepers,as Sir Miles Lampson suggests. Alternatively, as suggested in the Defence Plan,they could be laid up at Alexandria (or Haifa) with caretakers, where they wouldbe more secure from air attack, while awaiting their crews than at Malta. Ateither Alexandria or Haifa they would be suitably placed initially for either a mediterranean or a Far Eastern war. On the other hand, if they remain at malta, their crews will arrive at an early date with the Malta reinforcements,whereas if in the Eastern Mediterranean, a considerably longer period may berequired before the arrival of their crews, unless these can be supplied from fleetresources. On balance, however, it would probably be best to move these mine-sweepers to Alexandria, and to take early action with the Egyptian Governmentto commence training Egyptian crews in them. The Admiralty are taking thisquestion up with the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.Establishment of a Naval Base at Cyprus.16. The question of the establishment of a Naval Base at Cyprus has beenfully considered in other Papers, and, in our opinion, no useful purpose wouldbe served in re-examining the project in the present connection (Appendix I,paragraph 3 (d) ). The establishment of an operational and repair base at Cypruswould take many years to complete, and, as we have already shown, would costapproximately  20,000,000. It would, moreover, present us with a heavy additional military commitment, and although we are fully aware of the needfor additional docking facilities for the Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean, wesuggest that no additional steps should be taken in this matter at present overand above the negotiations which are now in progress for the provision of dockingfacilities at Alexandria, which in any case will be required as a defended base for the Fleet (Appendix III, paragraph 7).Naval Measures.17. As an additional measure which would add to the readiness of the Fleet,,H.M. ships Coventry and Curlew, which are specially fitted up as anti-aircraftcruisers with a heavy anti-aircraft armament, might be recommissioned. these vessels are at present not in full commission owing to lack of the necessarypersonnel to man them, and their recommissioning could at present only beeffected by paying off some other ship or ships. This matter is under Admiraltyconsideration.A rmy Measures.18. In his letter to the War Office (Appendix IV, paragraphs 3 to 6), theGeneral Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt expresses the opinion thatwith the present complete lack of A/A units and with the existing strengths andequipment now available, he cannot guarantee the security .of Egypt againstItalian aggression, unless reinforcements arrive within 14 days of the outbreak ofhostilities. Recent examination of the problem of reinforcing Egypt after theoutbreak of war has shown that the earliest date upon which the first reinforce-ments could arrive would be Z -)- 20 day for reinforcements from the UnitedKingdom, if routed through the Mediterranean, and Z + 24 days for reinforce-ments from India. The despatch of the former is dependent upon the situation at home, and of the latter upon the Government of India being able to spare them.19. The immediate measures proposed by Sir Miles Lampson to meet this situation in peace-time are contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of his telegram(Appendix I) and comprise the following : (i) Immediate issue of up-to-date equipment and armament to all units,especially Mark VI tanks and anti-tank rifles,(ii) Eoyal Engineer companies to be raised to war establishment witha 10 per cent, reserve.
o(iii) All other units in Egypt to be raised to higher colonial establishment.(iv) Completion of reserves of guns, armaments and vehicles, and theprovision of anti-gas equipment and a reserve M.T. company,(v) The provision of the following reinforcements :  (a) One anti-aircraft brigade (most urgent).(b) One field company, Royal Engineers.(c) One armoured car unit.(d) One mixed tank battalion.(e) One infantry brigade, including one machine-gun battalion withthe necessary signal and ancillary services.The Ambassador further recommends that, with the exception of the anti-aircraftbrigade, which should come to Egypt at all costs, the other units specified above should forthwith be stationed in Palestine with orders that they should standby to reinforce the garrison in Egypt at a moment&apos;s notice. We deal with theabove proposals seriatim in the paragraphs that follow.The immediate issue of up-to-date equipment and armament to all units,especially Mark VI Tanks and anti-Tank Rifles.20.   The question of the issue of Mark VI Tanks to Egypt is connected withthe larger question of the despatch of a tank battalion (see paragraph 36 below).21. The Boyes Anti-Tank Rifle is now becoming available. Twenty arealready being despatched to Egypt, and the rest required can soon follow.As regards the 2-pdr, anti-tank gun, four are being sent to British troops inEgypt and another four to the Egyptian Government. There are 44 of these weapons available with units in the United Kingdom, and from now onwardsthere should be a monthly delivery of twelve guns. Accordingly, the total require-ments of 33 guns for the British troops in Egypt could be met early if their demand is given priority.22. The British garrison in Egypt can probably be issued with Bren guns in March and April, if they are given priority.23. The armoured cars of the 11th Hussars cannot at present be replaced by more up-to-date equipment.Royal Engineer Companies to be raised to War Establishment with 10 per cent.Reserve.24. This proposal involves considerable difficulty. If, in addition toimplementing it, an extra Field Company, Royal Engineers (see paragraph 34below), is sent out to Egypt, it will take most of the available resources in R.E.personnel outside the Intermediate Contingent, F.F., leaving several FieldCompanies in the United Kingdom at cadre strength.A11 other units in Egypt to be raised to Higher Colonial Establishment.25. The four Line Battalions now in Egypt are already nominally main-tained on Colonial Establishment, but they are not up to strength. They can bebrought up to strength, but only at the expense of the battalions at Home. Thetwo Guards Battalions at present in Egypt are at Flome Establishment. Oneof them could be brought up to Colonial Establishment by drafts from Home,but the other, being a single battalion regiment (Irish Guards), could not be augmented.26. The Royal Horse Artillery in Egypt have 6 guns per battery at ColonialEstablishment, but the Field Brigade, R.A., have four guns only in peace, the other two being kept in mobilisation stores in the country. It would be possible tobring this unit up to Colonial Establishment, but only at the expense of units atHome.27. The Cavalry in Egypt during 1938 will be 250 under strength. Thisshortage could be made good only at the expense of units at Home.28. The Royal Corps of Signals in Egypt are already up to Colonial Estab-lishment, except for three sections which are non-existent. These could be pro-vided, but only at the expense of units at Home.
Completion of Reserves of Guns, Armaments and Vehicles and the provision of anti-Gas Equipment and a reserve M.T. Co.29. Requirements in anti-gas equipment, both personal and unit, of theGarrison in Egypt, are in process of fulfilment, and the final consignment will reach Egypt before the end of this year.30. As regards the remaining items of equipment, a great deal of detailis involved. The matter is under consideration by the War Office, and the questionof whether Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s proposals can be met depends not only on theorder of priority which is granted to Egypt but also on the dates of delivery.Reinforcements.31. We will now consider seriatim the question of the despatch to Egypt ofthe reinforcements requested by Sir Miles Lampson.32. One anti-aircraft brigade could be sent to Egypt from this country.This would include the necessary complement of specialists, but some of theremaining personnel would have to be made up from Field Artillery units andwould require training. It is estimated that this training would take about two months.33. Although no request has been made for searchlights, their provision isessential for effective A.A. gun defence and for co-operation with fighters at night.One company of A.A. searchlight R.E. (24 lights) could be sent to Egypt. the equipment is available, but, owing to the shortage of R.E. personnel, the onlysource from which the company could be brought up to strength would be from theregular searchlight battalion at Home. This would bring this unit to a very low state of efficiency.34. One Field Company, Royal Engineers, and one Armoured Car regiment.can be sent to Egypt from this country.35. It is impossible to comply with the request for a mixed tank battalionsince the medium tanks at present in this country are obsolete. A light tankbattalion could, however, be sent.36. The present situation as regards tanks in Egypt is that, in the battalion of the Royal Tank Corps and the 7th Hussars, there is a total of 19 obsoletemedium and 73 light tanks; six of the latter being loaned to the egyptian government.If the Light Tank Battalion was despatched from the United Kingdom, itwould have 45 Mark VI tanks, bringing the total of the light tanks in Egypt up to118. Arrangements have already been made to send out to the 7th Hussars14 Mark VI tanks to replace unserviceable Mark II tanks. If both these movesare completed, there would be 79 Mark VI. light tanks out of the total of 118 inEgypt; the remainder required for replacement of earlier Marks in the7th Hussars will not be available under the present programme before April 1938.The 8th Hussars are equipped with unarmoured vehicles; they will eventuallyhave light tanks, but it will not be possible to provide these until the 7th Hussarsare complete.37. One Infantry Brigade, including one Machine Gun Battalion, with thenecessary signal and ancillary services could be provided.38. We would emphasise, however, that this brigade could not be brought up to serviceable strength without calling up the Class A Reserve.39. Sir Miles Lampson has recommended that, with the exception of theA.A. Brigade, all the other units specified above should forthwith be stationed inPalestine, where the accommodation question is already a difficult one. Weoppose this recommendation. Inasmuch as these forces are intended for thedefence of Egypt, they should be stationed in that country, and suitable accommodation should be provided for them.Air Force Measures.40. In paragraph 6 of his telegram (Appendix I) the British Ambassadorasks that the air forces of Egypt should be reinforced by two Bomber squadronsand one Fighter Squadron, and that the re-equipment of all existing Squadrons inEgypt with new types of aircraft should be accelerated.
41. We would point out that steps are already being taken to improve our air situation in the Middle East. The re-equipment of one Squadron in egypt and one in Iraq is now under way and the last of the aircraft for these Squadronswill be shipped by the first week in December. The existing programme also pro-vides for the re-equipment of the Bomber Squadron in East Africa in March 1938.In addition, it has been decided to re-equip one Bomber Squadron (No. 33) now inEgypt as a Fighter Squadron with up-to-date aircraft capable of dealing withthe best Italian bombers, and it is hoped that this will be completed in the ordinary course by the Spring of 1938.42. It would, however, be possible, in addition, to despatch the one fighter and two medium bomber squadrons considered necessary by Sir Miles Lampson,but the re-equipment with fighters of the Bomber Squadron referred to abovecould be expedited if this were acceptable as an alternative to sending a fighter squadron from the United Kingdom. The re-equipment of the two remainingBomber Squadrons in Egypt over and above the Squadrons already due forre-equipment could also be carried out during the coming winter.43. On the other hand, it would not be possible to cany out the wholeprogramme immediately. A limiting factor is the possibility of packing thenecessary aircraft. The packing depot is already working to capacity within itspresent establishment, and it is unlikely that it would be practicable to pack theaircraft required (a) for the three additional Squadrons proposed by the Ambassador,(b) for the programme already projected for Egypt, Iraq and Kenya, and.(c) for the re-equipment of the Squadrons in Egypt over and above that programme,before some time in March 1938. Even this rate of packing only allows for the initial provision of a low scale of reserves, and the remaining aircraft to make upthe necessary reserves could not be despatched before the Spring or early Summer.Summary.44. We summarize below, for convenience of reference, the steps which itwould be possible to take to meet the requests put forward in Appendices I-IV,irrespective of any other considerations whatsoever.Army Measures.45. (i) Egypt oould be given priority of issue of up-to-date equipment and armament to all units, especially Mark VI tanks and anti-tankrifles.(ii) Royal Engineer companies could be raised to war establishment with a10 per cent, reserve.(iii) All other units in Egypt except one Battalion of Guards could be raised to higher colonial establishment.(iv) The provision of reserves of guns, armaments and vehicles, and theprovision of anti-gas equipment and a reserve M.T. Companydepends upon deliveries and the priority assigned to Egypt in these respects.(v) The following reinforcements could be provided :  i(a) One A/A Brigade  (24 3-inch A/A guns) and one A/ASearchlight Company (24 Searchlights).(b) One field company, Royal Engineers.(c) One armoured car unit.(d) One light tank battalion (but not a mixed tank battalion as requested).(e) One infantry brigade, including one machine gun battalion with.the necessary signal and ancillary services.-(vi) We see no objection to the delegation of authority to the General OfficerCommanding British Troops in Egypt to move certain British.Troops to Mersa Matruh at his discretion in case of emergency.
A ir Forces.(vii) The re-equipment of three bomber squadrons in Egypt. Kenya and Iraqwith modern types is already approved and will be effected this winter. In addition, it is hoped to re-equip one bomber squadron in Egypt as a fighter squadron by the Spring of 1938.(viii) The re-equipment of the remaining bomber squadron in Egypt could also be done this Winter,(ix) In addition, one fighter and two medium bomber squadrons could be despatched from United Kingdom to Egypt by March 1938.General Measures.Defence of the Canal.(x) So as to ensure that coast defence can be installed as rapidly as possiblefor the defence of the Suez Canal in an emergency, we suggest thatNahas Pasha should be invited to consider the preparation ofconcrete gun platforms at Port Said and Suez, and the storageof the necessary coast defence guns and search-lights in the vicinity of these ports in peace-time.Commissioning of A /A Cruisers Coventry and Curlew,(xi) The Admiralty had under consideration the commissioning of twoA/A cruisers Coventry and Curlerv.   This could only be effected,however, by paying off some other ship or ships.Provision of Gas Masks in Egypt.(xii) We suggest that consideration should be given to offering the egyptian government a certain number of gas marks on repayment for issueboth to the British and Egyptian civil population.Formation of an Egyptian Navy.(xiii) We see every advantage as a long-term project in the proposal for theformation of a mine-sweeping unit manned by Egyptian personnel.This could not take effect for some considerable time, and cannot,therefore, be regarded as an immediate measure. In the meantimefour British minesweepers might be stationed at Alexandria fortraining Egyptian personnel.Establishment of a Naval Base at Cyprus.(xiv) The question of the establishment of a Naval base at Cyprus has beenfully considered in other Papers, and we do not consider that any useful purpose would be served in re-examining the project in thepresent connection.Part III. The Effect of- the Measures indicated in Part II above onour Position &quot; vis-a-vis &quot; Germany.46. In the preceding Part we have, in accordance with the first portion ofour terms of reference, indicated the steps which it would be physically possiblefor us to take to strengthen our position in Egypt. We now turn to an examination of the second portion of our terms of reference, namely, the effect which the adoption of these measures would have on our position vis-a-visGermany.Army meastires.47. The despatch of the A.A. Brigade, R.A., and the Company of search-lights would weaken the air defence of this country, and, if guns were sent out,ammunition would also have to be provided. The despatch of one A.A. brigadewould represent a decrease of one-ninth of the mobilizable A.A. guns in theUnited Kingdom. The despatch of A.A. ammunition, on the scale at presentheld for A.A. defence at home, would considerably deplete stocks in this country.
The armoured car regiment and the light tank battalion are a part of the intermediate contingent of the Field Force, but other reinforcements could beprovided without denuding this contingent.The provision of personnel to bring units to Colonial Establishment wouldin varying degrees interfere with the training of units in the United kingdom in 1938. Supplies of Bren guns, anti-tank rifle and guns will be available in numbers early next year.Air Force measures.48. If we were to adopt the full programme indicated in paragraphs 41-43above, its effect upon our position vis-a-vis Germany would be considerable. Inits present state of expansion the strength of the air force at home is very seriously below that which we consider necessary to meet the threat of german air attack, and the despatch of the reinforcements demanded would still furtheraccentuate this weakness.49. The detailed effect of the full programme upon our position vis-a-visGermany would be as follows : (i) If the re-equipment of No. 33 Squadron referred to in paragraph 41above is to be expedited, this would only mean reducing our alreadyexiguous reserves of Gladiators by four aircraft, provided that this measure could be given priority over the supply of 15 Gladiators to portugal.(ii) The re-equipment of the bomber squadrons in Egypt and Kenya (otherthan No. 33) /jan be done without affecting our metropolitanprogramme.(iii) If it is decided, in addition, to send out another Fighter Squadron, thiswould mean rolling up a second Gladiator Squadron at home toprovide the necessary reserves, i.e., a total loss of 2 out of 8 fighter squadrons at home at present re-equipped with moderately up-to-dateaircraft.(iv) The despatch of the 2 additional Bomber Squadrons would involve rollingup one additional Bomber Squadron at home, i.e., a total loss of 3out of 4 of the 14 Bomber Squadrons at present equipped withup-to-date aircraft.(v) In summary, to meet Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s requirements, we should haveto reduce our Metropolitan Air Force by 3 medium Bomber and2 Fighter Squadrons at the present time. Of these, however, the oneBomber and one Fighter Squadron used to provide Aircraft reservescould be rc-equipped after a period of about 8 weeks, at the cost ofa corresponding delay in the completion of our Home Defencere-equipment programme as a whole.Part IV. Concluding Observations and Recommendations.50. In the preceding Parts of this report we have confined ourselves to thequestions specifically referred to us in the terms of reference quoted in para-graph 2. We feel, however, that it is our duty to invite attention to certainconsiderations of a military character which lie somewhat outside our terms ofreference, and to submit, in the light of these considerations, our recommendations as to the immediate military measures that should be taken to strengthen ourposition in Egypt.51. We have recently examined the problem of reinforcing our garrisons in the Mediterranean, Middle East and North-East Africa in the event of a unilateral war against Italy. The problem is a complex one, and presents many difficulties. These difficulties would be very greatly enhanced in the event of a multilateral war. If some or all of the measures set out in Part II were adopted,our military position in Egypt would be considerably strengthened in peace-time,and the reinforcement problem in the event of war against Italy wouldproportionately simplified.[16196] e
52. On the other hand, there are a number of other considerations to beborne in mind. In the first place we desire to recall that scarcely a year has elapsed since the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty; under the provisionsof which our military garrison in Egypt is limited to 10,000 men, except in theevent of emergency, or apprehended emergency. The Garrison in Egypt is alreadyslightly over 10,000 men; and it is therefore clear that the despatch of there reinforcements mentioned in Part II would raise it to a figure considerably inexcess of the authorised maximum. There was general agreement at the last meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence that there was little risk of animmediate threat to Egypt. The implication, therefore, is that the reinforcementshow proposed by Sir Miles Lampson should be a permanent addition to theGarrison of Egypt. We think that this point should be carefully considered byHis Majesty&apos;s&quot; Government in reaching their decision as to the character and extent of the reinforcements which should be provided.53. In this connection we desire also to invite attention to the discontentthat is inevitably connected with extra foreign service on a temporary basis with its attendant financial loss to the individual. The Army has already been compelled to increase its temporary Garrisons, both in the Far East and inPalestine, and the assumption of yet a third liability of this nature can onlytend to militate against recruiting.54. If there were any immediate threat to Egypt, we would recommendthat, from the military point of view, all the measures indicated in Part II ofthis report should be taken forthwith, provided, of course, that our relations withGermany permitted. In view of the fact, however, that no such immediate threatis apprehended, and that the primary purpose of strengthening our position inEgypt is to reassure Egyptian public opinion, we suggest that, from the military point of view, the following measures should suffice : Army Measures.55. (i) The despatch of one A.A. Brigade (24 3-inch A.A. Guns); and one a.A. Searchlight Company (24 Searchlights) (paragraph 45 (v) (a)).Note. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thinks it advisable to accept the disadvantages of this measure from the Armypoint of view. The Chief of the Air Staff on the other hand, fromthe point of view of the responsibilities of the Air Ministry for thedefence of Great Britain against air attack, is disinclined to give priority to Egypt in this matter.(ii) The despatch of one light Tank Battalion (paragraph 45 (v) (d)).(iii) Priority of issue to the British troops in Egypt of up-to-dateequipment and armaments, especially anti-gas and anti-tank(paragraph 45 (i)).(iv) Delegation of authority to the General Officer Commanding BritishTroops in Egypt to move certain British Troops to Mersa Matruh athis discretion in case of emergency (paragraph 45 (vi) ).A ir Force Measures.(v) The re-equipment of No. 45 Squadron in Egypt and No. 30 squadron in Iraq with modern bombers, now in hand, will be completed assoon as possible. On completion, No. 30 Squadron will be heldavailable for the immediate reinforcement of Egypt in anemergency.(vi) No. 14 Squadron in Palestine will be re-equipped in February 1938with modern bombers, in place of No. 84 Squadron in Iraq whichwas due for re-equipment in 1938.. (vii) The re-equipment of No. 223 Squadron in Kenya will be effected assoon as No. 14 Squadron is completed and should be completed bythe end of April 1938.(viii) No. 33 Squadron in Egypt will be re-equippedl as a Fighter Squadronas soon as possible. The provisional date for the completion of this -equipment will be April 1938.
(ix) The result of these air re-equipment measures will be that by April1938 there should be available in Egypt, or for the immediatesupport of the forces in Egypt in an emergency, 4 Squadronsequipped with modern bombers and 1 Squadron (at the expense ofan existing Bomber Squadron) equipped with modern fighters.Note. The full scale of reserves behind these squadrons willnot be available in the Middle East until the Summer of 1938.Naval measures.(x) The naval measures referred to in Part II, other than that in para-graph 15, which will be specially dealt with, are such as would onlybe necessary from the &quot; immediate threat &quot; standpoint, as theywould not be apparent to the Egyptian public.(Signed) CHATFIELD.C.

APPENDIX I.Copy of a Telegram from //is- Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (No. 635) dated November 12, 1937.MY despatch No. 1257 of 3rd November (by bag 6th November) containeddetailed comment on combined defence scheme prepared by heads of services. Itemphasised that recommendations in scheme were to be regarded as minima. Itwas written only three days after my return to Egypt, and I have since becomeaware that recommendations were minima in a different sense from that which Ihad at first supposed, i.e., they were based not so much on what heads of servicesbelieved was necessary for defence of Egypt, if that problem were considered by itself, but what was believed to be feasible in the light of preoccupations of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in other regions. I conceive it my duty, however, to submitmy views solely from Egyptian angle, leaving it to His Majesty&apos;s Government to judge comparative merits of requirements here and elsewhere.2. It is unnecessary for me to dwell on strategic importance of Egypt to ourselves. But apart from this, there is one primary and outstanding considera-tion which I must emphasise with all the force at my command, namely, thecomplete confidence still placed although it is diminishing in unofficial circles in our ability to implement our treaty obligation to defend Egypt. It is of thefirst importance that neither Egyptian Government nor the people should havecause to doubt this.3. Before getting down to details there are four other general considera-tions :  (a) Since Abyssinian campaign, the balance of force in the Near East froma military point of view has been completely reversed by arrival of italian reinforcements in Libya and their proved ability to reinforceon a large scale at short notice both their land and air force; whiledifficulties in reinforcing Egypt after hostilities have commenced have greatly increased.(&amp;) If I understand the position correctly, it would be most imprudent tobank on requisite supplies of material and personnel reaching Egyptintact through Mediterranean during early stages of hostilities. Butto this recognised danger must now be added the danger to transitthrough the Red Sea. If our secret information just received is correct, approach to Red Sea through Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb isalready complicated by presence of Italian guns. Our reports indicatethat batteries have been installed on Island of Dumeira, where channelis barely 10 miles wide (see correspondence ending with your despatch no. 593). Naval liaison officer is of opinion that Red Sea itself couldbe kept open as to surface craft by having at least one light cruiserpermanently in Red Sea plus East Indies Squadron based on Aden,but that coastal batteries and air attack would still constitute seriousmenace. I submit this is a highly important aspect that should beconsidered at once; apart from other effects, it might hamper arrival of reinforcements from India.(c) A prudent estimate must allow, in the light of events in Palestine, forveiled hostility, if not more (especially if things appear to be goingbadly) from population of neighbouring Arab States. This, inter alia, would complicate alternative of overland transit from Basrah.Further, the existing garrison of Palestine might well need reinforce-ment in above event.(d) Absence of an adequate and secure naval base in Eastern Mediterranean.Egyptian co-operation in construction of proposed dock at Alexandriais probable as things stand at present, but surely it would be unwise to place complete reliance in time of war upon necessary land facilities,including labour supply. I would quote paragraph 12 of yourdespatch No. 761 of 29th June to the effect that while it is still a grave objection that &quot;the only base in Eastern Mediterranean shouldbe in the hands of a fickle oriental Power, it must be remembered that
considerable British forces will, if an emergency arises, be availableto protect our base at Alexandria from any possible Egyptian acts of sabotage.&quot;&apos; But this is definitely not so. Heads of services reportshows only British troops available for Alexandria would be one battalion constituting General Officer Commanding&apos;s only reserve,which might have to be utilised elsewhere according to situation. Ican, therefore, in no sense guarantee that a situation might not ariserendering proposed Alexandria dock (apart from absence of properlocal defence) useless or unsafe. And at the best, the absence of repairshops, &amp;c, would surely reduce its value? I am aware that it mayhardly be within my sphere, but I cannot avoid opinion that it wouldbe far wiser and safer to revert to Cyprus project and not be dependentin so vital a matter upon the goodwill of any foreign country, whetherallied or otherwise.4. As a result of full discussion with General Officer Commanding and air officer Commanding in the light of above considerations, I submit absolute minimato which, in our opinion, effect should immediately be given if we are to be in aposition to ensure the safety of Egypt: Land. (a) Immediate issue of up-to-date equipment and armament for allunits as already asked for, especially Mark VI tanks and anti-tank rifles.(General Officer Commanding tells me he has none of the latter at all, though tenare being issued to Egyptian army). Royal Engineer companies to be raised towar establishment with a 10 per cent, reserve; all other units now in Egypt tocolonial establishment. Completion of reserves of guns, armaments and vehicles and provision of anti-gas equipment and reserve M.T. Company.(b) Reinforcements as follows : One anti-aircraft brigade (most urgent).One field company R.E.One armoured car unit.One mixed tank battalion.One infantry  brigade including one machine-gun  battalion, withnecessary signal and ancillary services.5. To be 100 per cent, safe, these troops should form part of garrison ofEgypt and despite considerable increase in numbers they involve, we might beable to get present Government to accept their presence without invoking &quot; appre-apprehended international emergency &quot; clause of treaty or arguments furnished in yourtelegram No. 514 of 9th November. But, as you know, political situation is atpresent uncertain, another Government might be less accommodating; moreover,there is always possibility of the Opposition making political capital. I there-fore recommend that, with the exception of anti-aircraft brigade, which should come to Egypt at all costs, the other units specified above should forthwith be stationed in Palestine, with orders that they should stand by to come to Egypt ata momenfs call.6. Air. In addition to one fighter squadron for defence of Alexandriaalready asked for in heads of services report, R.A.F. to be at once reinforced by two bomber squadrons equipped with latest long-distance bombers. replacement of aircraft of squadrons already here by up-to-date aircraft to be seriouslyaccelerated. Air Officer Commanding informs me that these requirements are themore urgent in view of secret information, just received from a reliable source,of reinforcement of Italian Air Force in Libya by twenty aircraft, believed tobe S 81, to form two new bomber groups at a new aerodrome just completed atTobruk.7. Our discussion has definitely confirmed my anxiety of a successfulsurprise attack oh Mersa Matruh owing to lack of sufficiently early information to ensure prior occupation by British troops. We propose trying to meet this by arranging forthwith with Egyptian Government for strengthening of light-car(frontier administration) patrols on frontier and for installation in western desertof air observation posts the same as in 1935, to be manned at once when judgednecessary Ideal would clearly be to station a strong British garrison in mersa matruh. International as well as Egyptian internal politics may well be against this at the moment, but I would once more most strongly urge that General OfficerCommanding be given forthwith unfettered discretion to move British units to
Mersa Matruh whenever he judges it necessary. Otherwise, I submit we are running an unwarrantable risk of being caught napping (please see paragraph of my despatch No. 1257).8. There is also possibility of a successful Italian attack on Sudan. Apartfrom the politico-moral effect both in Egypt and elsewhere, I should have thoughtsuch an attack would affect the defence of Egypt both as regards possible air attacks from south and occupation of Port Sudan, with its consequent menace tocommunication in the Red Sea. It is true that I am advised that occupation ofKhartum, Atbara and Port Sudan from Eritrea presents great militarydifficulties; none the less, I submit necessity of reinforcing Sudan from Indiathrough East Africa or Port Sudan upon outbreak of hostilities should at least be studied.9. Foregoing (with exception of paragraph 8) represents the minimum requirements to ensure defence of Egypt, and it is of profound importance thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should have in mind that inability to meet them maywell entail grave risk in the Near East and inability to discharge obligationsassumed under our alliance towards Egypt. If considerations elsewhere are held to override our Egyptian responsibilities, position is obviously very serious; nor do I see how we can counter the growing feeling restated in Parliament this weekby Ismail Sidki Pasha, in favour of an Egyptian treaty of reinsurance with Italy.Please read this telegram in conjunction with my despatch No. 1257, which covers a number of other important points, especially the risk of a breakdown of govermental and civilian morale, with all its implications, if our presentinadequate resources are not strengthened.10. Beginning of telegram has been seen and concurred in by General OfficerCommanding and Air Officer Commanding.(Repeated to Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean.)APPENDIX II.Copy of a Despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, No. 1257, dated November 3, 1937.Sir,I HAVE only been back at my post three days, but I have endeavoured,during that short time, to clear my mind on the Combined Plan for the defenceof Egypt prepared by the three Heads of Services, copies of which were forwarded to you under cover of Mr. Kelly&apos;s most secret despatch No. 1236 of 30th October.Before forwarding my comments thereon, as instructed in your despatch No. 760of the 30th June, I should like to pay a tribute to Admiral Pound, General Weirand Air Vice-Marshal Maclean and the members of their staffs for the prepara-tion of this most valuable and comprehensive scheme in the course of only eight days.2. When studying the plan, it must, in the first place, be borne in mind thatin many respects it is essentially a short-time scheme which will probably requirealteration when improvements are eventually made in the equipment of theEgyptian forces, the organisation of their reserves, and the training of territorialforces which, apart from the creation of a mobile striking force based on mersa matruh, will release a far higher number of comparatively efficient Egyptiantroops for the defence of the Western Desert than is provided for in the present plan.3. I would like first to draw attention to certain features in the recom-mendations of the three Heads of Services which seem to establish that theyshould be regarded as representing our minimum and not our maximumrequirements.4. For example, no less than four admitted possibilities (raids from shipson vulnerable points on lines of communications, a raid on the Suez Oil Refinery,a raid on the north coast between Alexandria and Mersa Matruh, and theshortening of the thirty-six hours period of notice for an attack on Mersa Matruh)are all listed as improbable.
5. Of these, the first three are technical matters which I am hardly qualified to judge: and on the fourth, I submit my observations with some diffidence, asit must be primarily a matter for military appreciation. The issue is, however,so serious and may, indeed, be so vital, that I venture to put forward one aspect of the matter which at once suggests itself to the lay mind.0. It may be that the Italians would launch their attack en masse as contemplated in paragraph 5 of Part I of the Plan, and that the situation would develop in such as way as to give adequate time for the proposed counter measuresto be taken during the precautionary period. But surely if the Italians realise,as they must, the vital importance of Mersa Matruh, they will use every effort to take it by surprise ? The increase of mechanised forces in Libya capable of moving across the open desert and not confined to roads must, I submit,substantially increase the possibility of such surprise. Is it safe to assume that information of an unusual concentration on the other side of the frontier would,in a vital emergency, necessarily be received in time to enable a British mobileforce to reach Matruh first or even to arrive before the Italians had had time to consolidate ? I should have thought not: and, if I am right, this is surely avitally material consideration. It might even be that Mersa Matruh could berushed and seized by a small highly mobile force in advance of the main body, and that this stroke might be the first warning of the opening ofhostilities. This possibility seems to deserve the most careful consideration.It is true that the position is now being improved to some extent by the transfer to Mersa Matruh of an Egyptian battalion for the purpose of putting the existingdefences into a state of repair and by the withdrawal to Mersa Matruh of theEgyptian battery of 3 - 7 Howitzers from Sollum. But, even when this battalionhas been equipped with modern weapons, it would be tempting Providence to rely on Egyptian troops standing up to even a minor attack unless stiffened bythe presence of British troops or at least British officers. It should also be borne in mind that, as I understand the position, the existing defences of Mersa Matruhwere sited on the basis of the maximum number of troops which were available at the time when the defences were laid out in 1935. If the danger I have fore-seen above in fact exists, it follows that it may and probably does involve revised arrangements for the permanent occupation of Mersa Matruh and for betterobservation in the Western Desert than there is at present. In this connexionI can only urge with all the emphasis at my command that further considerationbe given to the General Officer Commanding&apos;s request for authority to moveBritish units at his discretion to Mersa Matruh in normal times. This seems anelementary and most obvious precaution.7. There is another point. The plan relies in the main on the Alexandria-Mersa Matruh railway as the line of communication after the attack has developed. But there is the danger, certainly not in the least imaginary, of sabotage on a line running from Alexandria, to say nothing of possible air attack.The plan thus places a heavy responsibility on the Egyptian troops who are tobe responsible for the maintenance of communications and internal order through-out Egypt. I am not clear from the Report whether this special danger has been adequately considered and provided against.8. The position as regards communications with Mersa Matruh will be improved by the completion of the Alexandria-Fuka road, which is one of therecommendations of the Heads of Services and on which Nahas Pasha has already undertaken that work should be proceeded with at once. I have ascertainedprivately, however, that this will normally take one year to complete, and that,even with a special effort, the road could not at the best be ready before sixmonths. Further, the Report provides that it will be necessary to rely onrequisitioned lorries and local drivers to form any road link between Alexandriaand Mersa Matruh. It would seem well that civilian lorries and drivers shouldbe earmarked ahead for this purpose.9. One of the most important requirements of the Royal Air Force to enablethem to operate from Mersa Matruh and other landing grounds in the western desert is that adequate supplies of fuel and bombs should be made available therefor immediate use. A recommendation to this effect was recently put forward by the three Heads of Services as a measure of immediate necessity, but I learn that His Majesty&apos;s Government decided against this for the moment. It issurely mere common sense that effect should be given to this recommendation,
which will now be considerably facilitated by the presence of Egyptian forcesat Mersa Matruh which will enable supplies of fuel and bombs to be moved upto that area and stored away without causing undue attention. It appearsto me in the nature of an elementary routine precaution, and I can see no reason or adequate justification for deferring it until the actual need arises. Againthere is the vital question of the improvement of the water supply at mersa matruh, and here I would urge that effect should be given at once to therecommendations in paragraph 5 of Appendix 4 of the Plan that four portabledistillation units should be sent out forthwith.10. The second main impression which I have derived from the Report isthe truly alarming extent to which reliance has to be placed upon the arrival of essential equipment and personnel after the conflict has begun. The Report, it willbe observed, refers to the most alarming inferiority of our air forces during thefirst few weeks or even months, and even shows that the short ranges of our presentbomber types now in Egypt limit the attacks on the present Italian aerodromesto those situated relatively near the frontier. Further, while it shows up clearly the startling superiority of the Italian air forces in respect of both numbers and bombing range, enabling them to raid both Cairo and Alexandria, it emphasises the complete absence of anti-aircraft defence in Egypt. The importance of thisrelevation can hardly be exaggerated : and whilst I realise the difficulties ofremedying the deficiencies, I cannot refrain from urging with insistence that every effort be made to do so. Again, the inadequacy of the land forces is laidbare, even if it be less striking. Yet, the arrival of one very fast (&quot; Furious &quot;)convoy carrying aircraft, an anti-aircraft brigade and armoured-car fighting vehicles must be awaited for twelve days after &apos;; Zero,&quot; and, unlessfurther essential requirements (including an infantry brigade) can come from palestine, they must be brought in one or two fast convoys through theMediterranean. All this, together with a convoy from India, is postulated inaddition to an anti-aircraft brigade and one fighter squadron, which do not exist in Egypt to-day, but which the Report recommends should be sent out from theUnited Kingdom forthwith. The scheme thus seems to the lay mind to involveseveral grave risks : (a) the risk of part of the convoys never getting here at all;(b) the certainty of Egypt being left with inadequate defences for from twelve days to a month; (c) the diversion of the Navy to escort duties as its primary taskduring the critical period immediately after the opening of hostilities.11. I feel it my duty also to draw attention to the psychological effect of modern warfare on the volatile and hysterical Egyptian population, particularlyin the big cities, including the members of the Government themselves and seniorEgyptian officials. The knowledge that, with no anti-aircraft defence, they vverebeing exposed to a series of bombing attacks, possibly combined with the use of gas, might easily lead to disorders, and even a complete breakdown of themachinery of Government. But the plan relies solely on the Egyptian troops for internal security and anti-sabotage purposes. It rightly draws attention to thenecessity of a small British garrison being available for Cairo and Alexandria,but points out that, with the forces available, it would not be possible to have anysuch garrison in Cairo until reinforcements arrived. In the past experience hasshown the immense moral effect of the presence of Englishmen in stiffening theEgyptian army and police. The report places Alexandria first and Cairo fifth inthe likely order of priority of air objectives, but if the seat of Government werein Cairo at the time, the demoralisation and disorganisation of the centre ofGovernment would rank high as a. military objective for the enemy.12. All the foregoing considerations point to one general conclusion whichI would urge as of fundamental importance. I consider it is not merely the idealsolution, but a matter of vital necessity, that the garrison of Egypt should bemade to the utmost possible extent self-sufficient before the outbreak of hostilities.The recommendations are based upon the assumption that the supplies andreinforcements which will be admittedly necessary can be accumulated in Englandand sent by convoy after the outbreak of hostilities, although much of what isrequired is already available. I cannot too emphatically dissent from this policywhich I regard as involving a wholly unjustifiable risk of local disaster.13. In accordance with the recommendations in paragraph 45 of Part 3,Section I of the Plan, steps are already being taken to urge the Egyptian Govern-ment to bring the existing Air Raids Precautions Scheme up &quot;to date and toestablish an organisation for implementing it and to provide the requisite stores...
Under the existing Egyptian Air Raids Precautions Scheme no provision has,however, been made for supplying the whole civilian community (even in the big-cities) with gas masks, and I strongly urge that in the special circumstances inwhich Egypt is situated, His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake theprovision of gas masks for the whole British civilian community. As far as theItalian menace is concerned, the British families in Egypt will obviously be in which greater danger than the civilian population in England.14. I also recommend that one of the subjects to be discussed with theEgyptian authorities should be the supply of reserve medical stores for the civilian population of Egypt for use in the event of war, as I presume that afterthe outbreak of hostilities these would be unobtainable, at any rate for aconsiderable time.15. It will be seen that the Heads of Services suggest, in paragraph 0 of appendix 6, that, contrary to the views expressed in your telegram No. 503 ofthe 3rd November, the coastal defence guns and searchlights for eventual use inthe defence of the Suez Canal, should be stored in the Canal Zone and not at alexandria, which, in addition to being a long way off, will also be the centre of particularly heavy rail traffic. In the event of this recommendation whichI endorse being accepted, I see no special need to inform the Egyptians of theexistence of the guns, searchlights, &amp;c, at all. If, however, it is considered essential that they should be informed of their presence, it would be far better to explain their real purpose rather that to describe them as spares for use in alexandria or Mersa Matruh. In this connexion, I understand that, during his conversation -with the General Officer Commanding on the 25th October, thePrime Minister raised the question of the defences of the Canal. On GeneralWeir observing that the Suez Canal Convention prevented the erection of anycoast defences at Port Said or Suez, Nahas Pasha exclaimed that Egypt, being a free country, was certainly entitled to defend her coasts if she thought fit.Nahas Pasha may well return to this point.16. In paragraph 8 of Part 4 of the Plan, it is suggested that the egyptian government should be advised to form a navy, consisting, in the first instance, of six mine-sweepers, and, in the following paragraph it is suggested that theyshould be asked to agree to the laying up at Alexandria of four mine-sweepers,with caretakers on board, to be manned by British crews from Malta.in the eventof an emergency. It has been suggested to me that, pending the arrival of theEgyptian mine-sweepers, it would be far better to offer the Egyptian Governmentthe use of the four British mine-sweepers for the purpose of&apos;training Egyptiancrews possibly under a naval branch of the Military Mission. This certainlyseems worth consideration.17. No reference is made in the Defence Scheme to the question of thedeclaration of martial law by the Egyptian Government, which raises suchcomplicated issues as the powers to be&apos;delegated to the British General OfficerCommanding, the composition and powers of military courts, &amp;c. This matter was raised in paragraphs 3 and 4 of my secret despatch No. 297 of the 9th Marchin connexion with the revision of the Suez Canal Defence Scheme, and I have notyet received the views of the competent authorities of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment thereon. I suggest that the scheme, as eventually presented to Nahas Pashashould contain our proposals for dealing with this matter.18. The Scheme contains no provision for dealing with the question ofrequisitioning private property, &amp;c, which, in the 1935-36 crisis, was found topresent certain difficulties under the existing Egyptian Law.19. Part IV of the Scheme contains a list of the subjects in regard towhich, the active co-operation of the Egyptian Government will be required. Inaddition, there appear to be a number of other minor points in which action bythe Egyptian authorities will also be necessary, and which I suggest might be-conveniently added to the existing list in paragraph IV : Part III (i), paragraph 58.(1) The establishment of a depot containing fourteen days&apos; army storesat Mersa Matruh, including petrol and a quota of anti-tank gunsand ammunition, and the training of the Egyptian battalion intheir use.(&quot;16196] D
Part 111 (1), paragraph 60.(2) The construction and stocking of main dumps at Mersa Matruh forthe storage of petrol, oil and bombs for use by the Royal Air Force.(If approved, see paragraph 9 above.)Part III (ii), paragraphs 80 and 81.(3) The establishment of air observation posts in the Western Desert and out to sea during the precautionary period (or preferablyforthwith).Appendix 1 B, paragraph 12 (a) and (b).(4) The provision of extra pontoons at Mersa Matruh. (N.B. The Headof the Military Mission has already urged upon the Minister ofWar the improvement of port facilities at Mersa Matruh.)Appendix 9, paragraph 2.(5) The appointment of an Egyptian liaison officer to the Naval FortressCommander at Alexandria during the precautionary period. (Itshould be noted that there is no need to appoint a liaison officerattached to the Brigadier Commanding the Canal Brigade as,under the agreement with Nahas Pasha of last July regardingthe Frontiers Administration, an Egyptian liaison officer isalready to be appointed in the Canal Zone.)20. I would conclude this despatch with a strong recommendation that themost urgent consideration should be given by the Committee of Imperial defence to this plan and that action should be taken on the immediate recommendations contained therein as soon as possible. As reported in my secret telegram No. 607of the 2nd November, at my first interview with the Prime Minister, HisExcellency launched into a long and elaborate exposition of his fears regardingItalian aims. He showed grave preoccupations regarding the state of prepared-ness to resist an attack on Egypt, and even expressed doubt as to whether we inGreat Britain were taking the matter sufficiently seriously; I must confess thatI share the Pasha&apos;s fears. Nahas Pasha further stated that he had absolutely nofaith in any assurances given by Signor Mussolini and that he believed that Italianaggression was sooner or later inevitable. In the circumstances, it is all the more of profound importance that the details of the Defence Scheme, so far as theyare to be communicated to the Egyptian Government, should be in the handsof Nahas Pasha in the next few weeks, and that it should be possible to give him assurances that action on the urgent and essential points covered by theScheme is being taken.I have, &amp;c.(Sgd.) MILES LAMPSON.APPENDIX  III.Copy of a Telegram from the Comviander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to theAdmiralty, No. 296, dated November 15, 1937.TELEGRAM No. 635, 13th November, to Foreign Office. Repeated to commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, from Cairo.2. Paragraph 3 (b). As I pointed out in my remarks on J.P. 233, Iconsider risks to a slow convoy to be prohibitive, and to a fast convoy soconsiderable that our arrangements should be such as to avoid Mediterraneanroute as far as possible.3. Time factor only peimiits of Cape route being used if some military reinforcements are always at hand in Eastern Mediterranean. If garrison inEgypt must be kept within treaty limits, then Palestine appears only place wherereinforcements can be maintained.   Our report of 24th October recommended
that existing garrison at Palestine should be considered as available forimmediate reinforcement of Egypt, but a military force in Palestine in additionto present garrison would be, of course, far preferable. Anything which can bedone to reduce personnel and material which have to be transported to Egypteither by Mediterranean or Red Sea routes will greatly reduce task of Fleet and free it to carry out operations against enemy Fleet and coasts.4. In the Red Sea the air menace will be far greater than that from surface ships and escort ships already allowed for in war plan and which will provideanti-aircraft protection for convoys will adequately deal with surface ships.5. When suggesting stationing of one light cruiser in Red Sea, N.L.O.,Port Said, had not advantage of knowing provision which has been made in warplan for protection of convoys in Red Sea from air attack.6. A battery on Dumeira Island will no doubt be a nuisance, but a somewhatminor one compared to air menace. Channel to easward of Perim Island can beused and thus ships need not approach within 15 miles of Dumeira Island.Commander-in-chief, East Indies, is no doubt considering this question.7. As Their Lordships are aware, I have always considered a Fleet base in cyprus as far superior to Alexandria if base in addition to being a repair baseis also an operational base with an enclosed harbour capable of accommodatingwhole of force which would be operative in Eastern Mediterranean. It is only by having both operational and repair base in Cyprus that we can : (a) Overcomedifficulties of security given in 3 (d) of Ambassadors telegram, (b) Ensurenecessary underground reserves of fuel, ammunition, mines and depth chargesbeing available on opening of hostilities, (c) Remove great disadvantage thatknowledge of movements of fleet in and out of Alexandria, which would beavailable for enemy, would almost certainly render abortive any operationsdesigned to intercept enemy sea forces or supplies to Libya.8. I am aware that substitution of Cyprus for Alexandria as Fleet Basewould involve some dispersion of military and air forces and considerably increasecost, but it appears that these would be justified to secure our position in theMediterranean.9. As the construction of a base in Cyprus will take several years it will benecessary to use Alexandria as our operational base during those years and if alarge dock can be constructed at Alexandria in less time than base in Cyprus canbe completed, there is a great deal to be said for constructing a dock at alexandria.10. I am of opinion, however, that even if a dock is constructed at alexandria, it will not do away with necessity of constructing a base in Cyprus,but not necessarily at Famagusta.11. Subject to above I am entirely in agreement with Ambassadorsproposals.APPENDIX IV.Copy  of a  Letter from   General  Officer  Commanding   British  Troops  inEgypt to the War Office.Sir, Cairo, October 28, 1937.I HAVE the honour to refer to paragraph 5 of the covering letter to the combined Plan for Defence of Egypt, dated the 24th October, 1937.1. As stated in that paragraph, I concur in the view that in principle itis inadvisable to despatch Convoys by the Mediterranean route.2. I fully appreciate the Cabinet policy as explained in paragraph 2 ofWar Office telegram 50119 of the 23rd October, but feel it my duty to put forwardmy views as to the permanent change in the military situation brought about bythe arrival of Italian reinforcements in Libya, and the danger that might ariseshould the political situation vis-a-vis Italy suddenly deteriorate at any futuretime.3. Although the proposed reinforcements from India are due to arrive inEgypt on Z plus 24 day, it would be inadvisable to rely on these units being inaction in Egypt until Z plus 30 day.[16196] e
4. If Egypt is attacked from Libya by two motorised divisions withcompletely new equipment and perhaps with additional tank units attached,I submit, in view of the very great Italian preponderance in the air, it would betaking a grave risk to rely on the forces normally stationed in Egypt (which arein some cases much below war strength and whose armament has not yet beenbrought up to date) to hold out for a period of one month aided only by ill-trained and ill-armed Egyptian units.If my information is correct the Italians have sufficient M.T. to enable themto overcome the administrative difficulties of operating across the desert: in that case they would be in a position to maintain the pressure of attack.We might well succeed in inflicting a defeat on the Italian ground forces inthe first week, either by direct or indirect attack, but we should be almost certain to suffer considerable casualties in the Mobile Force in so doing, both in personnel and armoured fighting vehicles, quite apart from normal breakdowns.All our troops would be in the front lines from the very start. There wouldbe practically no reserve under my own hand, and the strain on the troops exposed to renewed attacks without any possibility of relief for a whole month might prove too much for them.5. I consider therefore that unless reinforcements of all kinds, includingarmoured fighting vehicles and A.A. units, can be brought into action withinfourteen days we are taking a grave risk which would only be justified if thegeneral international situation was such as to preclude the taking of necessaryprecautions beforehand in the Middle East.The need for fighter squadrons also need not be emphasised.6.   If that is accepted, there appear to be only two alternatives : (a) To station the necessary reinforcing units in the Middle or Near East.(b) To examine further, in spite of paragraph 1, the question of convoysthrough the Mediterranean.If the later alternative is decided on, I should be glad if I could be informed of the composition of Convoys as soon as possible.I have, &amp;c.(Signed) G. A. WEIR, General,&apos; General Officer Commanding,The British Troops in Egypt.
