FOREIGN BROAD-CASTS .(previous reference:Cabinet 39(37), Con-elusion 9.)1. The Minister of Health said that the questionof Foreign Broadcasts by the British broadcasting corporation had been raised unexpectedly in the Houseof Commons and it had been necessary to agree at short notice the terms of a statement with the B.B.C   this had been done, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had made a statement which had been agreed beforehand bythe Foreign Office and the Treasury.   The point he wished to make to the Cabinet was that it had been found desirable to make one modification in the scheme as submitted by the Cabinet Committee and approved by theCabinet.   He recalled that Recommendation (4) submittedat the end of CP.-247 (37) had made provision for an exchange of letters between the Director-General of theCorporation and the Permanent Under-Secretary of theForeign Office incorporating a &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot;to ensure close touch between the Corporation and theForeign Office.   On re-considera.tion it had been found desirable to replace the proposed exchange of lettersby a verbal understanding between the B.B.C. and theForeign Office.The Cabinet approved the alteration.
SPAIN. 2.   Viscount Cranborne said that there were not he Non- developments in the military.ry situation in Spain for hinInterventionCommittee.        to report.   The chairman s Sub-Committee of the hon-Intervention Committee had agreed to submit the BritishM previous reference:       proposals t&amp; the main Committee.   They v:ere accompaniedCabinet 39(37), Con-      by two recommendations:    first, that the proposalselusion 3 .)should be referred to the two Governments in Spa.in,F. R. MC^y7)^- together with an explanation of the a.attitude of the t^zur-iW^Governnent5ofvSoviet Russia:    and, second, that theSub-Committee should continue the examination of thepractical measures required to implement the ?ritishproposals, if accepted, including those measures whichwould be necessary as the result of the abstention ofthe Russian Soviet.    It appealed clear tirnt the Commis-sions could not be sent to Spain until the situation hadbeen cleared up a^-H^o the results of Soviet abstention.Nevertheless, the Earl of Plymouth considered that ana.dvance had been made on the previous position, and hopedthat it might be found possible to surmount the difficul-ties resulting from Soviet abstention.In reply to a question, he explained that the Germanand Italian representatives had agreed to send forward the British proposals to the main Committee with a recommendation that they should be forwarded to theSpanish Government together with an explanation of theattitude of the Russian Soviet Government, but that whatthey had not agreed to was to send the Commissions to spain without Russian a.greerient.The Cabinet took note of the above statement.
SP/TN,Relationswith theSalamancaGovernment(previous reference:Cabinet 34(37), Con-elusion 7.)JL- %3. Viscount Crsnborne reported good progress inthe negotiations for the appointment of a British Agentwith General Franco, and. conversely, of a SpanishNationalist Agent in London.    It had been hoped that thearrangement might have been announced last Monday.   TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had stipulatedfor the release of certain British ships detained inNorthern Spanish ports.    Three of these had already been released and General Franco&apos;s,Government had agreed %o fu^hload- certain-of^h-ero with iro-n-o-re*.    There were some minor difficulties also:    for example, as to the suit-ability of the Agent proposed, by General Franco&apos;sGovernment, namely, the Duke of Alba.    The ForeignOffice were telegraphing to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atHendaye aski-nsr him to make discreet efforts to securethe appointment of some more suitable person.The most important difficulty, however, was thatduring the last week-end a ship named JEAN ATEEMS, whiehhad been under the British Flag for a few weeks, hadbeen sunk, by a Frankist aeroplane   it was believed.A telegr8.ro was being drafted by the Foreign Office, inconsultation with the Board of Trade, making certainrep-resent at ions to General Franco&apos;s Government, including a call&apos; for apoloeies and disciplinary action againstthe pilot.The Secretary of State for Air asked that thedemand for disciplinary action might be dropped,   Asimilar demand had. been included, without consulting theAir Ministry, in the case of the recent episodes in japan and had been a cause of much difficulty.Viscount. Cranborne said that the Foreign Office had.not anticipated difficulty in the present case, but heprqsmised to make a. note of the Secretary of State forAir&apos;s point,   The Foreign Office were most anxious to
conclude the matter as early as possible as theyapprehended that if the matter was delayed for any length of time fresh a&quot;difficulties would develop, moreespecially after the concentretion in the Mediterraneanof the Prankist naval forces release^ from NorthernSpain.The Lord Chancellor urged that the matter should hesettled during the present week.   A Judgment affectingthe question ha^ been given in the appropriate Court ofJustice and was to  come before the Court of Appeal nextMonday.    If the original Judgment was upheld, seventyships would be able to sail from Eritish ports to the ports of the Spanish Government and would, almost certainly cause trouble at Salamanca.    It was eminentlydesirable, therefore, to obtain an early agreement forthe exchange of Agents .After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the proposed agreement with general franco&apos;? Government for an interchange ofAgents should be expedited and should, ifpossible, be concluded, during the present-week:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should continue his efforts tosecure a. more suitable representativeof General. Franco&apos;s Government in Londonthan the individual at present proposed,but that the negotiations on this point-should not be allowed to delay the eon-elusion of an agreement:( c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs need not think it necessary to insist too strongly over the case of theS .S. JEAN WEEMS (provided, that assuranceswere given that there would be no repetition of the outrage) if this was liable to delay the negotiations for an interchange ofAgent s:(d) That in the case of the S.S* JEAN WEEMSViscount Cranborne should take into account the objection of the Secretary of Statefor Air to including a demand for disciplinary action against the Spanish pilot concerned.-4-
THE PAR EASTJapan and china.The BrusselsConference.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(37), Con-clusion 4 *)4.   Viscount Crarihorne reported that he had that morning spoken on the telephone to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs at Brussels.   The Secretaryof State reported that he had had a good day on theprevious day, that a public Meeting would take placetoday and would probably be the only public Meeting.He himself proposed at present to say little beyondagreeing with Mr Norman Davis, who was to speak firstHe was telegraphing information that he could notcommunicate on the telephone.-5-
5. The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew the attention of the Cabinet to a telegram from Sir G.Ogilvie-Forbes, Perlin (No.2^7 of the 1st November)reporting that rumours had been in circulation for sometime that Herr Hitler intends shortly to summon theReichstag and make a new peace offer to the world,  inwhich he woul^ include revision of the Colonial clauses of the mreat.y of Versailles.    He asked whether, if herr hitler made an snnouncement to this effect, the PrimeMinister would summon a Meet ins? of the Foreign AffairsCommittee of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister replied that this would depend upon the nature o^ Herr Hitler&apos;s announcement, if made.-6-
THE MEDITER-RANEAN ANDTHE middle east./y.situation in-previous reference:Cabinet 39(37), Con-el ueion 5.)6. The Cabinet had before then a Note by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-259 (37))covering an extract from the draft Minutes of the300th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,together with a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CI.D, Paper No. 1364-B), on the subject ofthe Situation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East,The draft Conclusions reached by the Committee ofImperial Defence, who had been asked to consider whether any steps of a military character, and if so, what steps, could be taken at the present time in view ofall the circumsta.nces, with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle East (Gabinet 38 (37)Conclusion 6 (b)), are reproduced as an appendix to these Minutes, together with the conclusions andrecommendations of the Chiefs of Staff (attached asan Annex).As the first recommendation of the Committee ofImperial Defence proposed that general approval shouldbe given to the Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the military measures which might be taken at the present time with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle ^ast, the Cabinetbegan by considering the recommendations of theChiefs of Staff.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring toPara. 23, recommendation (e)(iii) of the Chiefs ofStaff Report, viz.:-&quot;That in principle it is very desirablethat the guns and lights now in S,S,THISTLEGARTH should be transferred tothe Egyptian Authorities as soon aspossible and. mounted at Alexandria&quot;,said that this question had recently been before theTreasury    Inter- Services Committee in its financial aspects.   He wanted it recorded by the Cabinet that-7-
the question of whether or not the guns were to he trans-ferre* as a gift, to the Egyptian authorities required further consideration.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointed outthat in the corresponding Conclusion of the Committee ofImperial Defence (300th Meeting, Conclusion (c)(ii) itwas recommended that T-!is Majesty&apos;? Charge d&apos;Affairesshould be requested to advise whether or not it would, be appropriate at the present time, in view of the existingaccommodating attitude o^ the Egyptian Government, to use the transfer of the guns and searchlights as a bargainingfactor in connection with negotiations concerning harbourimprovements and the provision of a dock at Alexandria.The Prime Minister pointed out that the immediate question was as to whether the guns should ^e landed at alexandria.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence explainedthat the first question that, arose was the disembarkationand storage ashore at Alexandria, of the anti-torpedo netsnow in S.S. THISTLe&amp;AR-H .    If the Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires was able to arrange this, it would be very important toarrange also for the landing of the guns, as the costs ofdemurrage for the S.S. THESTLEGARTH were piling up.^he Lord President of the Council suggested that the-bargain over the harbour improvements and the provisionof a dock, with which it was suggested to link up thequestion of the transfer of the guns, need not hold upthe actual landing of the guns.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that it neednot.Viscount Cranbo^ne said that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs had asked him to call attention toone or two points.Referring to the statement in the Chiefs of staff report that &quot;any troops which may be despatched to
Palestine from Egypt will he immediately replaced from elsewhere&quot; (C.I.D. Paper No. 13S4-B, Para.23 (d)(ii)),the Secretary of State would be glad if this could be announced by Question and Answer in the House of Commons.mlThe Secretary of State for War said he would likefirst to consult his Department.Subject to the Secretary of Statefor War having no objection, theproposal was approved.Viscount Cranborne said that the Secretary of state had also askert him to draw attention to a passage in theChiefs of Staff Report in which it was stated that any steps of a military character which could be taken atthe present time with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle East must be limited by thecondition &quot;first that they must not. be liable to beconstrued by the Italian Government as provocative&quot;.He pointed out that the Italian Government did notobserve any similar condition but had moved troops toLibya without regard to whether the movement wasprovocative or not.mhe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thatthe reason for this  condition was that it was consideredundesirable to get into a vicious circle where first one government and then the other was making provocativemovements.The Prime Minister pointed out that the intentiono^ the Cabinet decision had. been to avoid spectacularmovements which were liable to be construed as provoca-tive.   His own phrase, as stated at the 4th Meeting ofthe Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee on 23rd July,193 7, had emphasised the importance of doing &quot;nothing which could   arouse Italian suspicions or be construed as provocative&quot; (C.I.T5. Paper No,1364-B, Annex I, lastline on pa.ge 6).   This was the correct interpretationto be put on the Cabinet decision.-9-
mhe Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped that, this wouldhe recorded, not as a new decision hut merely as theinterpretation of the previous decision.This was agreed to.Viscount Cranborne drew attention to Conclusion (d)of the Committee o*&quot; Imperial Defence, as follows :-&quot;To invite the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to consider whether the present time was favourable for re-opening with the egyptian authorities the question of the strength of ourgarrison in Egypt, with a view to requestingthe Egyptian Government to offer us morefacilities than we at present enjoy under theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty&quot;.The Foreign Secretary, he said, felt that it would be unwise to re-open the Egyptian Treaty so soon after its conclusion.   The Legal Adviser of the Foreign Office had pointed, out also that under a strict application of theTreaty the British troops were not limited to 10,000 menuntil they had been withdrawn to the Canal Zone.The Secretary of State for Air said that this Conclu-sion had arisen from a point he had raised.   He had not really intended that there should be any variation fromthe Treaty, but rather that advantage should be taken ofthe anxieties of the Egyptian Government to encourage themto ask us to do more than was provided for under theTreaty.   For example, if it was found impossible under theTreaty to maintain a proper strategic reserve for theRoyal Air Force in Egypt it might be to the advantage ofthe Egyptian Government to suggest that it should beretained in Egypt instead of being sent to ^enya or else-where.Viscount Cranborne said the only point the foreign secretary had wished to make was that he mast not be askedto re-open the Treaty at the present time.The Lord Chancellor suggested that it would be better to ira.it until the Egyptian Government approached us .-10-
The Prime Minister agreed and. thought it would, bebetter to let this recommendation stand, over until we wished to senr1 reinforcements to Egypt.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the Conclusions of the Committeeof Imperial Defence &apos;Appendix) subject to thefollowing:-(a) That the instruction to be given by theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs to the Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires in Egypt to take up with the Egyptian Government as soon aspossible&quot;The transfer of the coast defence gun*and. searchlights now in S.S. T3IST&amp;EGARTHto the Egyptian Authorities with a viewto their installation in due course at alexandria.......&quot;,does not prejudice the question of whether these guns should be handed over as a gift,or on payment, or on loan:(b) That, subject to the agreement of the Secre-tary of State for War after enquiry in his department, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in concert with the Secretary of Statefor War should arrange for an announcement tobe made in Parliament, in reply to a Question,to the effect that &quot;Arrangements have beenmade to ensure that any troops which may be despatched to Palestine from Egypt will be immediately replaced frons elsewhere&quot;:( c) That the passage in the Report of the Chiefsof Staff which &quot;states that any steps of amilitary character which could be taken atthe present time must be limited by the 6on*-dition &quot;first that they must not be liableto be construed by the Italian Government asprovocative&quot;, must be construed in accordancewith the Prime Minister&apos;s remark at the 4thMeeting of the Defence Plans (Policy) Committeeon the 23rd July, 193 7, where he emphasised the importance of doing &quot;nothing which couldarouse Italian suspicions or be construed asprovocative&quot;.    The object was to avoid,spectacular movements which might start aseries of movements and. counter-movementsby the two nations:(d) ^hat Conclusion (d) of the Committee ofImperial Defence ^Appendix) must not be interpreted as an instruction to the Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs to re-open the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.   Any direct actionon our part to give effect, to this Conclusionshould be reserved, until nearer the time when we wished, in the interests of the defence of&quot;SgyPt, to send reinforcements, or until wewere approached by the Egyptian Government.(discount Craaborne left the Cabinet at  this point.)
RAID PRE-;autions bill.7o     The Cabinet had under consideration a JointLvji-oiandaiu by the Hone Secretary and the Secretary ofPrgV&quot;&apos; ous , . .Reference: State for Scotland (-H.A.-44 (37))  covering the draftf37)&quot;neCon-        Air Raid Precautions Bill, the main objects of whichelusion 80)       v;ere to make statutory provision for the preparation ofAir Raid Precautions schemes by Local Authorities andto settle the apportionment of expenditure between theExchequer and Local Authorities.    The conclusions reached by the Committee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C., 13thConclusions (37),, Minute l) were as follows&quot;(l) To take note    that the financial provisionsof the Bill would be further considered ata Meeting of the Cabinet Committee on air raid Precautions Expenditure on the morning of Tuesday,, November 2nd,, 193 7.(2) To recommend the Cabinet to authorise theintroduction forthwith in the House of commons of the Air Raid Precautions Bill in the formof the draft annexed to H.A*--44 (37), subjectto any modification of the financial provisionsof the Bill which might res tilt from the Meetingof the Committee on Air Raid PrecautionsExpenditure on November 2nd., and subject alsoto any drafting or other minor alterations thatmay be found necessary or desirable.The Committee -also took note that any nodifi-cations of the financial provisions of theBill resulting from the Committee on Air RaidPrecautions Expenditure would be reporteddirect to the Cabinet.&quot;The Prime Minister, referring to conclusion (l)above, reported that the Cabinet Committee on Air RaidPrecautions Services had met on the previous morning,but had not concluded its enquiry.      They were to meet again the same afternoon when he hoped that a decision might be reached.The Home Secretary asked that he might begiven authority to proceed with the Bill subject tothe decision   that might be reached by the CabinetCommittee that afternoon.      The Parliamentary Secretaryto the Treasury was pressing him to circulate the bill before the end of the week.- 12 -
The Prime Minister said that the only possiblemodification in the Bill would be a small concession tolocal authorities in cases where they were involvedbeyond the proceeds of a Id. rate.      The Committeeincluded,besides himself, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Home Secretary, the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, and he thoughtthat perhaps the Cabinet might be willing to approve theBill subject to their decision.     This was agreed to.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defencedrew attention to clause 5 of the Bill and suggested thatsome modification should be made in the language thereofto enable local authorities to make some provision for thematerial maintenance   of people v/hose means of sustenance,e.g. bakeries and so forth, had been destroyed in an air raid.       He contemplated some arrangement corresponding to that made in the case of medical supplies but notfood storage.In the course of a short discussion,apprehensions were expressed that the extension of clause 5, as proposed by the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence, would occasion many difficulties inParliament, for example, it would be liable to raise a discussion on the whole question of food storage in timeof war, and thus to complicate the consideration of theBill.       It was also very late to make so important an alteration in a Bill which at present, dealt not with waremergency, but only with peace provisions.     It wassuggested that the question of food stuffs could be dealtwith under the provisions of the Defence of the realm regulations.The President of the Board of Trade realised the difficulties, but suggested it might be the easiest   .- 13 -
way to do something about food storage.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence saidthat in view of the discussion, he would not press his proposal, but he had thought it right to warn the cabinet of the importance of this point.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To authorise the Home Secretary toproceed with the Bill as recommended in conclusion 2 of the Committee ofHome Affairs,  quoted above, subject to(b) Any modifications of its financial provisions resulting from theproceedings of the Cabinet Committeeon Air Raid Precautions Expenditure.
8.      The Cabinet had under consideration a Memoran-dum by the Secretary of State for Scotland (H.A.-46covering the draft Housing (Agricultural Popula-tion)  (Scotland) Bill, the object of which was to giveeffect to certain recommendations made by the ScottishHousing Advisory Cormmtttee in their Report on rural housing in Scotland:    together with the following recommendation by the Committee of Home Affairs thereon(H*A^. 13th Conclusions (37), Minute 3):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the Housing(Agricultural Population)  (Scotland)Bill in the form of the draft annexed to K.A.-46 (37), subject to any drafting or other minor alterotions that may befound necessary or desirable.&quot;The Cabinet approved the recommendationof the Committee of Home Affairs as setforth above.
SUPEFJuWQA- 9*   -ke Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumTION (VARIOUS ^ .SERVICES) by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (H.A.-45 (.37))BILL. , .covering the draft Superannuation (Various Services)(Previous        Bill, the object of which was to confer on certain reference:Cabinet 39     Departments power to apply the complete Civil Service(37), Con-elusion 15). pension code to their staffs:    together with the follow-ing recommendation thereon by the Committee of HomeAffairs (H.A.C. 13th Conclusions (37), Minute 4) :-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the Super-annuation (various Services) Bill in theform of the draft annexed to H.A.-45 (37),subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that nay be found necessary or desirable.&quot;The Cabinet approved the recommendationof the Committee of Home Affairs as setforth above.
THE INHERITANCE    10.  The Cabinet had under consideration the Inheri-(FAMILY PRO-VISION) BILL.tance (Family Provision) Bill, introduced by a private member and down for Second Reading in the House of(previous reference.Commons on Friday, November 5th, 1937;    together with^37K8Con-        a Memorandum   by the Lord Chancellor (CP.-261 (37))conclusion-on 5o)        getting forth his reasons for being strongly opposedFR. lcf(^)lu^0 any legislation on this subject.The Lord Chancellor read to the Cabinet astatement of the views of the six Chancery Judgesfiveout of six of whom advised that the disadvantagesoutweighed the advantages of the proposal.     he recognised, however, that the Bill would receive a gooddeal of sentimental support both in the House of commons and the House of Lords and that the Government could,hardly oppose it.      He had wished, however, that theCabinet should realise the objections to the Bill.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries reported that in Scotland an individuals estate was divided into three equal parts, one of which was set asideby law for the wife, one for the children while the thirdwas at the disposal of the person making the will.This scheme had worked well in Scotland, but he agreed with the Lord Chancellor in his view of the proposed bill as applied to the English law.The Prime Minister said he had made enquiries,and he was inforne d by the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury that the Bill was now in the form in which ithad emerged from the Committee Stage in a previousParliament.     Nearly all the opposition had nowdisappeared and there was likely to be something likeunanimous support to the Bill.     He thought that the right course should be that the Law Officer in charge of the Billshould point out fully and frankly the difficulties and- 17 -
assume an attitude of neutrality towards the Billhut not oppose j.t.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the attitude towardsthe Bill as proposed by the PrimeMinister:(b) That every effort should be madeto encourage as full a Debateas possible on the Bill-
&quot;HE AGRICULTURAL       11.The Cabinet had under consideration the[ARKETHJG ACT ,1933) AMEND-      Agricultural Marketing Act (.1933) Amendment Bill,T BILL.introduced by a Private Member and down for Secondrevious Reading in the House of Commons on Friday, 5th November,reference:cabinet 58 193 7.3 (5)    Co n***elusion 9 &amp; The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesppendix.)pointed out that the members of the agricultural committee of the House of Commons were likely to vote for the BilloThe President of the Board of Trade statedthat the Bill involved a real and important reversionof principle on the part of the Government,     Up tothe present time, the Government had always refused toprovide quotas for purely protective purposes except as an essential part of a marketing scheme for particular articlesc      If this Bill were passed, weshould be adopting a system of quotas which we hadfrequently condemned in the case of other countries.The adoption of the Bill would also raise great difficulties and compel us to denounce a number ofcommercial treaties with foreign countries.Some discussion took place as to whether thePresident of the Board of Trade or the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries should be responsible forarranging for an expression of the Government&apos;s views in Parliament.     Although it was recognised that,ifthe President of the Board of Trade were responsible,it might be suggested that the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries took a different view, it was felt thatthe arguments against the Bill belong to the sphere oftrade rather than agriculture *- 19 -
The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Bill should be opposed:(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should not act personally asthe Spokesman of the Government but should arrange for opposition to be offered to the Bill by the parliamentary secretary (Captain The Right Hon.D. Euan Wallace).

In this connection His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affairesshould also be requested to advise whether or not it would be appropriate at the present time, in view of the existingaccommodating attitude of the Egyptian Government, to use the transfer of the guns and searchlights as a bargainingfactor in connection with negotiations concerning harbourimprovements and the provision of a dock at Alexandria;(iii) The storage in Egypt of 4 6-inch guns, 6 searchlights, and thenecessary ammunition at present held at Malta for the defenceof the Canal terminal ports.

)ANNEX.Extract from Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.(C.I.D. Paper No. 1364-B.)Summary of Conclusions.23.   Our conclusions and recommendations are as follows: (a) We reaffirm and invite particular attention to. the following extract fromthe Report which was submitted to the Cabinet on the 18th October,1937 (see paragraph 2 (i) above) : The provision of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft defencesin Egypt is in itself eminently desirable, and would be a valuablefactor in establishing confidence in Egypt and stabilising thesituation in the Eastern Mediterranean, but in present conditionscannot be considered independently of the international situation as a whole.(b) In view of the Cabinet decision quoted in paragraph 4 (a) above, any stepsof a military character which could be taken at the present time inview of all the circumstances, with a view to increasing our prestige in the Near and Middle East must be limited by two conditions : first,that they must not be liable to be construed by the Italian government as provocative; and, secondly, they must not appreciably weaken ourposition vis-a-vis Germany.(c) In view of the above limitations nothing very spectacular can be done,but the measures summarised in conclusions (d) and (e) below should,in their cumulative effect, tend to strengthen our position in Egyptboth morally and materially.(d) The following measures are already in hand or contemplated :  (i) the re-equipment of certain bomber squadrons in Egypt, kenya and Iraq with modern aircraft,(ii) arrangements have been made to ensure that any troops whichmay be despatched to Palestine from Egypt will be immediatelyreplaced from elsewhere. In addition, the Government ofIndia have been requested to treat the despatch of a brigade to egypt as having first priority over all other reinforcementcommitments which they have piwisionally accepted,(iii) the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt hasbeen authorised to encourage any proposal which may be put to him by the Egyptian Government to re-occupy Mersa Matruhwith Egyptian troops.(e) We recommend that the following additional measures should be taken :  (i) The Air Officer Commanding, Middle East, should be authorised toestablish petrol and bomb dumps in the Western Desert on the under-standing that he and the General Officer Commanding are satisfied asto their security.(ii) The anti-torpedo nets now in S.S. Thistlegarth at Alexandria should bedisembarked and stored ashore at Alexandria if this can be arranged.(iii) That in principle it is very desirable that the guns and lights now inS.S. Thistlegarth should be transferred to the Egyptian authorities assoon as possible and mounted at Alexandria. If, however, in theopinion of the local authorities, we should by such action lose a valuablebargaining factor in connection with negotiations concerning harbourimprovements and the provision of a dock at Alexandria, the gunsshould in any case be landed and stored at Alexandria.(iv) The guns and lights for the defence of Canal Terminal ports now storedat Malta should be stored in Egypt if this can be arranged,(v) The   ammunition   for   the  gun   defences  of  Alexandria   now   inS.S. Churruca should be disembarked and stored in Egypt.
