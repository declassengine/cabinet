1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked that as many of his colleagues as possible wouldmake e.n effort to attend the Memorial Service in westminster Abbey to the Hon. R.W. Bingham, the lateAmerican Ambassador.
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had received, applications from twenty M.P.&apos;s,who were members of the Opposition Labour Party, to visit Spain during the coming Parliamentary Recess.Sir Stafford Oripps had  challenged the legal right ofthe Foreign Office to refuse visas, but had. acceptedthe conditions laid down. The   position governing the refusal of visas was, he was advised, not very good, in law.   Apart from the legal position, however,he thought that from the political point of view it-would be unwise to refuse the applications .^he Prime Minister agreed, and pointed out thatrefusal would lay the Foreign Secretary open to a charge of using his position in the interests of Party.The Cabinet agreed.  ^hat the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have authority to grant the applications made by Members ofParliament to visit Spain during the recess .-2-
SpATN* ?0 ^e Cabinet resumed their discussion of questions^&quot;Refugee arising from the refugee problem in Spain on the basisiroblen.of CP--3 02 ( 37) , which had. been before them at theprevious Meeting referred to in the margin.Reference:Cabinet 47 The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as(,47). Con-elusion 2.) arranged at the last Meeting of the Cabinet, he had discussed this question with Lord. Cranborne, who had.thrown fresh light on the proposals in CP.-302 (37).He gathered that the real intention was not to make animmediate contribution of  2^,000, but to inform the promoters of the Refugee Scheme that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were willine to contribute  2^,000 to theorganisation when it had actually been formed, providedthat sufficient money was obtained from other sources and. that other nations were associated to an extent sufficient-ient to produce a real international co-operative scheme.He had satisfied himself that the promoters of the schemeincluded a number of reliable people:    for example,a Mr Hanson, who had been the principal official inDr. Nans en&apos;s office and who therefore had greatknowledge of such matters.    If he (the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer)  criticised the scheme, it. was not froma purely financial point of view.   He felt some doubts,however, as to the wisdom o&apos;f the proposal, which might provide an inconvenient precedent;    for example, we might be asked to contribute to the refugee problem inChina.    If, however, the Cabinet felt that politicallythe proposal was a wise one, he would not object to it from a Departmental point, of view.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thankedthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.    He had no doubtwhatsoever as to the very bad state of the children in the camps in Catalonia,    The proposal was to supply
them with one hot meal a day.   A medical adviser had.reported that if no-thing of this kind were done therewas a danger of typhus.   Prom a. humanitarian point ofview, therefore, there was everythine to he said forthe proposal, for which there were a number of prece-dents, especially after the end of the Great War (e.g.,Austria).    Sir J. Hope-Simpson, who was a great expertin these matters, had been consulted and had reportedfavourably on the scheme.   The French were stillmaintaining a great many Spanish refugees, and anestimate had been given him to show that the FrenchGovernment had spent not less than  480,000 on these services.   He associated himself with the Secretary ofState for Air in regretting that these movements ofpopulations had ever taken place, but as these had occurred he thoueht the scheme should be supported.He thought it probable that the scheme would not appealto General Franco, but he himself proposed to see the duke of Alba and explain matters to him.    On balance,therefore, he appealed to the Cabinet to support thescheme, on the understanding that no contribution would,be made unless the scheme was actually launched.Some discussion took place as to whether it wouldbe possible to bring tbe scheme to an end. after four months.The Cabinet were informed that, in the past it had.always been found very difficult to bring such schemes to an end:    e.g., in punit1ffl      &apos;The Prime Minister adhered to the view that he had expressed at the previous Meeting.   Apart from thehuma.nita.rian aspect, which me.de a strong appeal to him,he thought that in the long run it would be politicallyadvantageous to have done something for the children.r4-
He was not impressed by the suggestion that thiswould form a precedent for corresponding ajciior---inChina as the conditions were ve^y different in thatcountry.    He thought that when explanations were madeGeneral Franco could hardly object.The Cabinet agreed  that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to informthe promoters of the scheme for givingassistance to child refugees inCatalonia that. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be willing to contribute  2^,000as soon as they were satisfied, that theremainder of the sum necessary to start the scheme and. to maintain it for four months ( 147,000) would be available from other qua.quarters, including preferablyforeign Governments, an&quot; that the scheme would be administered on a. genuineinternational basis.    No money would bepa.id. unless a scheme on these linescould be launched.
SPAIN. 4. The Secretary of State for War informed theThe Military       Cabinet that the Leader of the Labour Opposition,Situation.the Right Hon. C.R. Attlee, had kindly consented toFR^C^J?:       give his impressions of the military situation in spain to a military Officer.   He gave the Cabinetthe particulars contained in the Appendix to these minutes.
fff? PAR EAST.japan and china.Future Policy(previous reference:Cabinet 47(37), Con-clusion 4.)F R.f5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,recalled that at the last Meeting of the Cabinet,referred to in the margin, he had read to hiscolleagues an account of a conversation between his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at. Washington and theAmerican Secretary of State,He then gave the Cabinet an account of subsequentconversations with the American Government bearing on future policy.(NOTE:    A fuller record of the Secretaryof State&apos;s account is availablein the Secretary&apos;s File ofCabinet Minutes.)-7-
- MOST SECRET. -ANNEX TO CABINET 48 (5 7) T CONCLUSION. 5-.(For reasons of secrecy the Prime Minister thoughtit inadvisable to include the attached note inthe circulated copy of the Cabinet Conclusions.One copy has been communicated to the foreign secretary for record, and this copy has beensubmitted to the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS recalled that at the last Meeting he had read to his colleaguesan account of a conversation between His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington and the American Secretary ofState.    On the following day the President of the UnitedStates had asked Sir Ronald. Lindsay to see him secretly,and the interview had taken place on Friday eveningafter a Diplomatic Reception at White House.    ThePresident had begun in somewhat vague terms, referring to a possible blockade of Japan and movements of ships to take place after the next incident.   The idea ofsome form of Naval mobilisation had not appealed to thePresident, since it appeared that the American ships are kept up to full complement and the term &quot;mobilisa-tion&quot; therefore had not the same significance in america as here.Two propositions had emerged, from the conversation;first, the President was willing to take part in naval staff conversations, and these were now being arranged:and, second, he was willing to consider sending someships to Singapore and to advance the date of theAmerican Naval Manoeuvres from April to January.He himself, in consultation with the Prime Ministerand First Lord of the Admiralty, welcomed, the President&apos;sproposals, but would, prefer to see some immediate action
as a deterrent to another &quot;incident&quot;.   A message tothis effect had been sent to Sir Ronald Lindsay andhad probably been communicated to the President on theprevious day, but no reply had yet arrived.It was clear that President Roosevelt was doing his best to mobilise his public opinion, but the Secretaryof State warned his colleagues against taking too optimistic a view-of any immediate action.   nevertheless he felt that the Presidents attitude was an encouragingfeature in the situation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the advance in thePresident&apos;s position was due largely to the attitude ofthe Japanese themselves .   Our difficulty was not inPresident Roosevelt&apos;s good will, but in his failure to appreciate the needs of the situation.   He gathered thatthe President and Mr Morgenthau were still contemplatingthe possibility of sanctions without war, and it wasnecessary to convince   them that it was impossible toapply a blockade without being ready to support it by force, if necessary.   He and the Foreign Secretary bothfelt that now was the time for a move if it was to bemade at all.    Our prestige was suffering in the Far Eastand elsewhere owing to our unavoidably passive attitude.Nevertheless, except in the event of a serious aggression by the Japanese, he felt it would be a mistake for usto send ships to the Far East.    Our efforts, therefore,must be directed, towards bringing home to president roosevelt the realities of the situation.   The american naval Officer who was to visit this country might beable to bring home to the President the realities ofthe strategical position.   He felt that any simultaneousdemonstration of force by the United States and ourselves,whether in the Far East or even at a distance, wouldhave a steadying influence all over the world.
THE HOME SECRETARY&quot; agreed with the Foreign secretary and the Prime Minister, and pointed out that theappearance of American ships at Singapore would have amuch greater influence on world opinion than ante-datedAmerican Naval Manoeuvres in the Pacific.Whitehall Gardens, S .W .1,22nd December, 1937.
IM&amp;TE ofHONS.Reform of.previous reference:Cabinet 45(37), Con-elusion 5.)6.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-515(37)) outlining the history of the question of the reform of the League of Nations;    pointing out thatat the next meeting of the Committee on the Applica-tion of the Principles of the Covenant the agendawould include discussion of Lord Cranborne&apos;s Report-on the participation of all States in the League(i.e., universality), when an expression of opinionfrom the United Kingdom member of the Committee onthe subject of the coercive provisions of the Covenant-might well be unavoidable;    putting forward three mainlines which His Majesty&apos;s Government could follow inregard to them:    and seeking authority for theprinciple of a.n intermediate Lea.gue on the general lines advocated, in Lord Cranhorne&apos;s Report.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked for a  certain amount of latitude in the line to be taken at Geneva, and made clear that he did not propose to take an initiative unless this was unavoidable-able.   He accepted, a proposal by the Minister ofLabour to forward him a Memorandum by Mr Leggettdealing with the subject, from the point of view of experience at the International Labour Organisation,where Japan and Brazil were still represented and theUnited States of America co-operated.The Lord President of the Council approved thegeneral line in CP.-31*; (37)), but suggested to supplement it by saying to the world that the originalconception of the League of Nations a.s set forth inthe Covenant was obviously impracticable in presentcircumstances when important nations were standing.out,and consequently emphasising that whatever was donewas intended to be of an interim character *
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he agreed with this view, the more so because,since circulating CP.-315 (37), he had received aletter from the Secretary-General of the Leaguecontaining proposals very much on the lines of thosesuggested by the Lord President, and intimating that possibly even the League Committee of Twenty-Eightneed, not meet but that the Council should pass aResolution On these lines.The Prime Minister said he understood what was proposed was a transitory modification of the appli-cation of the Covenant until the League could recoverits original position, but. that there should be no alteration in the Covenant.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed that this was the conception, and pointed outthat Resolutions passed in 1921 ha^ contained aninterpretation of Article XVI.    ^he League might perhaps make an addition to those interpretativeResolutions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested, thatin this  country confidence in the League had been rather shaken by the long explanations that weregiven as to why  in  particular questions it did. not prove effective.   Rather than pass further inter-prete.tive Resolutions he thoueht it would, be better to adopt the Lord President&apos;s suggestion in the formof a modus Vivendi during the present period, whenthe actual situation o-f the League was so very different from that envisaged by its founders.He also criticised the Continental procedure under which every Resolution was preceded by a lengthypreamble in which every sentence was prefaced by theword &quot;Whereas&quot;.   This did not appeal to the british public&apos;.
The Prime Minister agreed with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer&apos;s way of treating the subject.The Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs andForeign Affairs supported the Chancellor of theExchequer1s suggestion of a modus vivendi.Yhile recognising that  a. wide discretion must beleft to those responsible for representing the viewsof His Majesty&apos;s Government on this question, theCabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposal ofthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in CP.-315 (37) that when thequestion of Reform of the League was brought up (whether at the LeagueCommittee of Twenty-Eight or at theCouncil) the United Kingdom represent-ative should, not make any pronouncementuntil he had to do so, but that if, as seemed probable,  a point was reachedwhere it would be necessary and desirable for him to intervene, he should beauthorised to take a. middle course andto suggest that me?The^ship o^ the league should involve a general obligation to consult, an^ an additional obligation totake coercive action when, but only when,consultation between members of the Leagueindicated that coercion might profitablybe employed:(b) That in making any such proposal theUnited kingdom  representative should,unless the circumstances rendered, thisundesirable, argue that the originalconception o^ the League was impracticableso long as important nations remainedoutside, and suggest that anything donenow should be of an interim character and. should be adopted, as a modus vivendito be applied, not by amendment of theCovenant but by Resolution of the appro-priate body of the League:( c) That the Minister of Labour should forward,to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs a Memorandum by Mr Leggett dealingwith the subject o^ League Reform fromthe point o^ view of expedience at theInternational Labour Organisation.
The Foreign Secretary recalled thatthe private letter to be sent ot the Commissionexplaining their instructions remained to beagreed.The Secretary of State  for the Coloniesagreed that this was so.

Foreign Office,S.W.I.17th December, 1937.My dear Billy,Bobbety tells me that he has discussed with you the re-draft of the proposed despatch to Jerusalem on policy in Palestine, which was enclosed in your letter ofDecember 14th, end that he has explained to you some ofmy anxieties in connexion with it.   You will by now havereceived my telephone message on the subject, but I thinkit may be useful to confirm and explain it in writing.I understand that your main point is that nothing should be said in the published despatch whichmight imply any undue or premature readiness on our part to abandon partition and consider some alternative.    I fully appreciate the importance of this, but Bobbetytells me that you would have no objection to clearing up any points of doubt in the confidential communication to be addressed to the Chairman of the Commission underCabinet Conclusion (g) of December 8th.   This applies particularly to the sentence in paragraph 4 of your draft which states that the Commission is to provide thenecessary materials for a decision to be reached as totheRight HonourableOrmsby Gore, M.P.
the practicability of any particular scheme.   It is clearthat only His Majesty&apos;s Government can reach a finaldecision as to the equity of any scheme of partition.But, as Bobbety explained, I think it is essential thatthe Commission should be entitled, as part of its dutyof providing materials for such a decision, to consider any relevant evidence, to express its own opinion and,should it think right, to make recommendations on thegeneral question of the practicability of partition.    Iunderstand that you   would be ready to agree to this being made clear in the proposed confidential communica-tion to the Chairman.I am sending copies of this letter to the other ministers concerned..  Yours ever,(Sgd.)   ANTHONY EDEN.
8... The. Cabinet had before them a Mo^t Secret Reportby the Trisrlr Situation Committee (c.Pc-300 (37)) on theGeneral Constitutional Position and the Prospects of aSettlement&quot; of&quot; Outstandfng Questions with the Irish FreeSta-fee-   Qn the General Constitutional Position theCcasmxttee made recommendations to the Cabinet under theFoTZovrznff heads r    &quot;The new Constitution vis-a-vis NorthernXrelSrnd!^r    &quot;The Form and Method of Announcement of theDecision&quot;:    &quot;The Position of the Irish Free State as aMember of the Commonwealth&quot;.    In dealing with the subjectof the Prospects of Settlement of Outstanding questions and the proposed Conversations with Mr d.e Valera, theCommittee included recommendations on (a.) Defence,(b) Finance, and (c) Trade.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs made some introductory observations and. thereafter explained the various recommendations contained in CCP* 300 (37)which were discussed seriatim and in detail.The Home Secretary gave the Cabinet particulars of communications he had exchanged with the Government ofNorthern Ireland, including the contents of a letter from lord Craigavon, received in advance by telephone that very morning, and which resulted inamendments to the draft statement contained in CP.  300 (37)Appendix I, Annex I, as set forth below0   (Conclusion l(d)(iIn accepting these-amendments, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs warned the Cabinet that, inhis opinion, it was likely to ruffle the feelings ofMr. de Valera.      He himself^ however, appreciated thedifficulties of the Government of Northern Ireland inthe matter and realised that there would be a strong feeling in the House of Commons if that Government was
Q 9 0dissatisfied with the arrangementsa     He agreed,therefore, that it was necessary to make the concession.In summing up the discussion on the subject ofDefence, the prime Minister pointed out that thedecision depended on two factors:    first, whether ourpresent rights would work out satisfactorily in practice in the event of war, or, alternatively, whether it mightnot he better to give up our rights in favour of oofwe-assurances by the Government of the Irish Free State,relying on the general circumstances of the case toobtain the essential goodwill of the Irish Free State.In discussing the financial recommendation,the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that theCabinet Committee had not discussed the special duties in detail.     He himself would not object to their withdrawal because their object was not revenue but to recoup money withheld from us by the arbitrary actionof the Irish Free State Government,,     The protectiveeffect of the special duties had been counteracted by/V.bounties granted in the Irish Free State, but,although he was not protesting against the principle,there were bound to arise details of importance onwhich he hoped he would be consented.The Secretary of State for Scotland pointedout that, although it might be possible to remove theduties, there were also quantitative regulations whichcould not be removed without very serious results to northern Ireland.     While agreeing, therefore, that iiheMinisters conducting the negotiations should have discretion to remove the duties, he did not think theyshould have so free a hand in the removal of the quantitative regulations.
The Prime Minister pointed out that in discussing the financial settlement, the question of thespecial duties naturally arose0      It seemed clear thatthe aggregate of the Irish Free State payments would notequal the annuities and, consequently, a bargain wouldhave to he considered.      The Cabinet Committee had wanted to have something which they could concede.        When,however, it came to the discussion on trade questions,full consultation would be necessary with the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State forScotland.The President of the Board of Trade suggestedthat the question of a trade agreement dealt with und-*rheading (3) ought to be brought up at the same time asthe financial questions under heading (2), and some discussion took place on this point.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs agreed that it would be very desirable to consider (2)and (3) together if possible, but he pointed out thatthe question of finance was rather mixed up with that ofdefence.The Lord President of the Council presumed thatthis point was covered by the general discretion given tothe negotiators.The Prime Minister agreed that the financialpart of the agreement could not be considered whollywithout relation to the trade agreement and that at somepoint the Ministers concerned in the latter would have tohe brought into the consultations.The President of the Board of Trade, referring to the last paragraph on page 7 of Cop0 300 (37), suggested- 15 -
that the penultimate line should read as follows:-&quot;to enter into negotiations for a general trade agreement on a reciprocal basis.inthe-*Milm&apos;e of our Ottawa Ag-roome-n-to with-the other Dominioao.&quot;This was agreed to.The Minister of Labour enquired whether anyquestion had been raised as to reciprocity inunemployme nt insurance.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said this question had not been raisedeThe Cabinet agreed:i.

and paragraph 37, where he stated -&quot;That in the long run the provision of adequate defences within the means a tour disposal will only he achieved when our long-term foreign policy has succeeded in changing the present assumptions as toour potential enemiess&quot;He next drew attention to the objectives of Imperial Defence as set forth in paragraphs 41-44,which he asked the Cabinet to confirnuTurning to the application of   thispolicy to the Defenc-o Programmes (Seotion V)he pointed to the staggering cost of the new standardof Naval strength contemplated by the Admiralty, but expressed the hope that, after receiving explanationsfrom the First Lord of the Admiralty, he might be ableto suggest some improvement on the D0RoC0 Programmebased on the retention of ships which were due forscrappingoIn dealing with the Army, he pointed to theheavy and costly services with their large demand on man-power and material, which the Army had to undertakefor the other Services, such as Air Defence and coast defences,,      This, he realised, handicapped theSecretary of State for War in making proposals foreconomiesp      Coming to the rSle of the Regular Army,he said that he had based his proposals on a suggestion made by the Secretary of State for War at an earliermeeting of the Cabinet that France no longer looked tous in the event of war to supply an Expeditionary force on the scale hitherto proposed (paragraph 69) ,      this and other developments referred to in paragraphs 70 and71 had led him to suggest that the employment bf theArmy outside this country should be related to tftiedefence of Imperial commitments, thus rendering possible,
he hoped, a large reduction in the scale of reserves of material.     He had been warned by the Secretary ofState for Warf however,  that sometime must elapse before he could comm-micate detailso     He had felt it incumbent- however, to warn his colleagues inparagraph 75 of the possible consequences of thisproposal, a point on which he had received a letterfrom Sir Robert Vansittart before that officialproceeded on leave sComing to the Territorial Army, the ministers aid that the Secretary of State for War hadcriticised the following proposal in paragraph 79 (ii):*-&quot;Certain Territorial units might,, therefore,be earmarked for duties in connection withthe maintenance of order and of essential services in this country in time of war,&quot;He thought, however, that there was not muchdifference between him and the Secretary of State onthis point, as his own idea x:cs that circumstances might arise which necessitated the calling on of theMilitary to come to the aid of the civilianauthorities for particular purposes from time to time,and that some troops, who might be Regulars, if theywere still in the country, would be required on such occasions.     He had thought it might be desirableto have some Territorial units in this country forthe purposeoComing to his proposals;..;: t    the Air Force(paragraphs 80-100), he said that the principalissue arose in connection, with bomber aircraft which had been the subject of some controversy between the Air Staff and himselfo     He himself held the view that, in view of the previous Governmental-
declarations as to parity, we must have enough fightersin this country to defend ourselves, but that this neednot necessarily apply to bombers.      In other words,he thought that parity could be achieved by a Forcesufficient to resist an aggressor v/ithout ournecessarily possessing the same number and types of bombers.The Air Staff, whose professional vjews cn this questiondeserved the utmost considernation, took the view that toprovide an inferior Force of bombers would not meet our public declarations and would have a defeatistappearance.      If that view was accepted, he was driven to make the proposals in paragraph 98.In reply to the Secretary of State for Air,the Minister explained that his proposal that &quot;weshould not make further increases in the overseaForces&quot; was not intended to exclude the IS squadronsfor overseas provided under Air Force Scheme F, butonly to the additions to that scheme provided inScheme J.      The proposals in paragraph 98 fell short ofthe Air Staffs demands but, nevertheless, in viewof the financial and economic outlook, he thought thatthey were the right course.In conclusion, he drew attention to the summary of the issues arising cut his Report containedin page 15, paragraph 101, of CP. 316 (37).The Prime Minister thanked the Minister forCo-Ordination of Defence for his Paper and for his statement which he felt sure would be of the utmostvalue to the Cabinet in reaching their conclusions.As the morning, however, was far advanced, he thoughtit would be necessary to meet in the afternoon.
The Cabinet agreed:To adjourn until the same afternoon in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room in theHouse of Commons at 5.0 p.m.Whitehall Gardens, S.W-1.22nd Dec ember, 1937.
APPENDIXNOTE ON INTERVIEW WITH MR.  C.R. ATTLEE.I went to see Mr., Attlee on 14th December 1937.    he spoke to me for about half an hour on what he had seen in spain cn the Government side.      He had been to Barcelona,and travelled via Valencia to Madrid, where he visited partof the Government front line and various units and militaryorganizations in rear of the fr-mt.Mr. Attlee was much impressed by the military organ-ization and system which appeared much better developed and efficient than he had anticipated it would be.      He consider-ed the standard reached by the new Spanish Army very similarto that of our new Armies in the spring of 1915.      In most cases the clothing and personal equipment of the men wasin very fair condition;    the weak point was the boots.      Themen were alert and handled their arms reasonably well.    the junior officers and N.C.O.&apos;s appeared to have good powersof command.      Mr. Attlee does not know,  of course, whetherthe units he saw were typical of the Army as a whole,  or were specially selected for him to see, but,  as he visiteda number of units, he considers he was in a position toform a fair opinion of the Army,  at any rate on that particular front.Mr. Attlee visited the front line trenches on the Madridfront.      The general conditions reminded him of a fairlyquiet sector on the Western front in 1915/16.      There wasnot much shelling, but spasmodic bursts of machine gun andrifle fire, and occasional bombardments by light trenchmortars.      On account of the latter weapons all the frontline trenches were provided with overhead cover.      the trenches generally were well constructed and in good condition,  and there seemed to be a proper system of sentriesetc.
Most of the commanders Mr. Attlee met impressed him as knowing their jobs and having a grip of the situation.There are political representatives with the Army,  similarto the Commissars with the Russian Army, but Mr. Attleewas informed that these confined their activities to workin connection with the comfort and welfare of the troops,and sometimes political education;    they did not nowinterfere with the commanders in any way.Mr. Attlee did not see any tanks, but discussed tankswith various officers.      These did not appear to be favourably impressed with the performances of either theirown or the enemy tanks,  and were dissatisfied with the types of tanks which they had been able to obtain.      Onthe other hand they were pleased with their anti-tankweapons.      And each soldier was issued with a few rounds ofarmour-piercing ammunition,  which had been found to penetratethe armour of such tanks as had been used against them.Mr. Attlee was in Barcelona during an Insurgent air attack.      The anti-aircraft defences on the land side were considered to be fairly effective, but it was admitted thatthe town was rather defenceless against attack from the sea.Mr. Attlee was favourably impressed by the members ofthe Spanish Government whom he met,  and judged that therewas a greater degree of unity among them than he hadsupposed.      In his opinion the Communists are not a danger-ous influence,  and the Anarchists have learnt that a warcannot be waged on anarchical principles.      His appreciation of the situation is that there is little likelihood of the insurgents gaining a decisive military success in the nearfuture.      On the other hand Mr. Attlee did not see muchprospect of the Government forces carrying out any consider-able offensive operations, as they were inadequately supplied
14th December,   1937.with Supporting weapons.      On the Government side the food situation was undoubtedly rather precarious, though the troops were adequately fed by Spanish standards.      Provided the:food difficulties could be overcome, he saw no reason to anticipate any loss of morale or weakening of determination to continue the struggle.      Hence,  as long as there was nomarked increase in foreign intervention on the Insurgentside, he did not foresee any deterioration in the Governmentsituation in the near future.(Signed)    D-F. Anderson.-D.D.M0I.
