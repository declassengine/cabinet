THE PRIME 1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who occupiedMINISTER.the Chair, informed his colleagues that he had seen thePrime Minister, who was indisposed and had been strongly urged by his medical adviser not to attend the Meetingof the Cabinet.   The Prime &quot;&quot;inister hoped to haverecovered within a few days.
VISIT OP THEKING- OP the belgians.Luncheon in he City.*2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed hiscolleagues that, in vier of the Luncheon to be giveii bythe City Corporation to the King of the Belgians onWednesday, IToveriber 17th, the Prine Minister proposedto hold the usual weekly Meeting of the Cabinet on that day s.t 10 a.m-Thc Secretary of Sts/fcc for Foreign Affairs, while not urging that every merit)er of the Cabinet should attend the Luncheon, hoped that as nany as possible would go.Preliminary enquiries indicated that nine or tenmembers of the Cabinet were prepared to accept the invitation of the City Corporation, and this was consid-ered a sufficient representation.
SPAIN. 3- Tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said the&quot;*Non-        that, despite somewhat chequered meetings, the Non-intervention .        .,    -    .Committee.     intervention Committee had made progress since une last meeting of the Cabinet.    They had agreed to submit to(Previous n ^  n n      -    -Reference:   the Governments Terns of Reference for Commissions to cabinet 38 .  . .(37)    Con-   proceed to Spain, which would clear away the existingelusion 3.) ,political obstacles, so that only technical difficulties would remain.    On the surface it appeared that only onePower was likely to disagree with the course proposed,namely, Soviet Russia.   The Soviet Ambassador, besidesdisagreeing, had insisted on the principle of unanimityof the Non-intervention Committee.   Other nations, however^.including even the French, were prepared to go on withoutSoviet Russia..   M. Maislcy had suggested a compromise, butthe Secretary of State and the French Ambassador had pointed out that the scheme the Committee was discussingwas a compromise.    It was possible that if Soviet Russiarefused the scheme the Germans might do so also.   At anyrate, Herr Ribbentrop had been more difficult than CountGrandi.   He himself had. seen Count Grandi before themeeting and had persuaded him not to refuse the proposals.He understood that Count Grandi had exceeded his instruc-tions in agreeing.   The result was a. much better atmospheretowards the creation of which Count Grandi and thePortuguese ALiba.ssa.dor had been most helpful.   The earl of Plymouth was seeing the representative of ea.ch countryin turn, with a view to securing agreement as to the personnel and Terms of&apos; Refer-nee of the Commissions to**t proceed to Spain.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that ifthe Italians and Germans wanted to break the scheme the Russians had given them the opportunity.
In the course of a short discussion it was pointedout tha.t acceptance of these proposals by the two partiesto the Spanish dispute would probably depend to a consid-erable extent on the degree of influence exercised by soviet Russia on the Valencia Government.
SET?/ft&quot;B*ST4-    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidox-thcoming       that he was exercising all possible pressure on thei*izs ^ elsonference.       Japanese Government to accept the invitation to the brussels  Conference.    He then called attention to am^Terence:       telegram he had received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at cabinet 38 ,(37), Con-       Prussels reporting that, according to Baron von Neurath selusion 4.)son, who was a Secretary in the German Embassy m Brussels,FR.ivO(37)V *Baron von Neurath was thinking of attending the BrusselsConference in person.   He himself had telegraphed to saythat this would be a  great advantage, and he&apos;..had alsotelegraphed  to the Italian Foreign Minister suggesting that he also should try and attend.    Their presence,apart from the Far Eastern discussions, might afford anopportunity to discuss affairs in Spain.He had discussed with the Prime Minister the composi-tion of the United t-ring^om Delegation at Brussels, andunderstood that the Prime Minister proposed to ask theSecretary of State&apos; for Dominion Affairs to be his  colleague.The Cabinet agreed  (a.) that the United Kingdom representatives atthe Brussels Conference on the Far eastern situation should be -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of St^te for Dominion Affairs.and should he announced in Parliament thefollowing day:(b)  That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should enquire as to the precedents for announc-Inj? the names of senior Officials who would beattached to the Delegation, and should, have discretion to announce them if he thoughtadvisable :( c)  that the Secretary of State secret Foreign affairs should give  consideration to the suggestion ofthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thatin the event of his having to return to london the ^arl of Cranborne should  join Mr Malcolm Macdonald at Brussels daring his absence:i* (d)  mo take .note that the Government of india had nominated Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar as their representative at the Brussels Confer-once and that his instructions will be to
conform to the attitude of His Majesty&quot; sGovernment in the United. Kingdom;   butif the question of sanctions should arise,to refer to the Secretary of State forIndia for instructions:(e) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, as Chairman of the AdvisoryOomriittee on Trade Questions in Tine of 7/ar,hoped to &quot;oe able to eo&quot;tunicate to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, ifhe required it, a draft of his Report bythe end of the present v.reek, and probably a Final Report to follow early next week.-6-
PHE MEDITER- 5* &apos;shG Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs askedMIDDLE EAST,   for a decision as to the reply that the Charge&quot; d&apos;AffairesSituation        in Egypt should make to the suggestion of the Egyptianin egypt,pt.        Government for the adoption of certain precautionary*(Previous        measures by the Egyptian forces inside Egypt.   TheCabinet 38     question of reinforcements was not raised.   What theclusion^T)    Egyptian Prime Minister wanted was that Egyptian troops/  ./and stores should be sent to Mersa Matruh and ths.tcertain dumps of ammunition should be provided.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thatthe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had completed a Report-to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the military sideof steps that could be taken at the present time toincrease our prestige in the Near and Middle East.    TheirReport would come before the Committee of Imperial defence on the following day.   He gave the gist of their Report,adding that the General Officer Commanding had been instructed that if he was consulted by the egyptian government with a view to sending Egyptian troops and supplies to Mersa Matruh he should give every encourage-ment to the proposal, but that the movements of Britishtroops that had been suggested by the General OfficerComma.commanding should not take place without further referenceto the War Office.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had recently been in Egypt and had found the Egyptian PrimeMinister and Makram Pasha in a very forthcoming mood asregards the defence of Egypt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatdetails should be discussed at the Committee of ImperialDefence on the following day.$ This was agreed to0The Cabinet agreed   .That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to instruct the Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires in Egypt to express
his concurrence in proposals by theEgyptian Government for militarydefensive precautions inside Egypt,such as moving Egyptian (but not British)troops and stores to Mersa Matruh and theformation of dumps of stores and munitionsat convenient points.

Agriculture.UNITED STATES 7.    The Cabinet had before them a Report by the&apos;ibP AMERICA.Cabinet Committee on Trade and Agriculture (CP.-251Negotiationsfor a Trade       (37)), who had had under consideration a MemorandumAgreement.  circulated to them recently by the President of the(Report offcabinet Com-     Board of Trade (T.A.C.(S6) 49, attached as an Annex totaittJe on trade and the Report) on the present position of the discussions at Washington for a Trade Agreement between the UnitedKingdom and the United States of America.   After explain-ing the difficulties that had arisen and stressing the urgency of finding some solution of the present impasse,the Committee summed up their Conclusions and Recommenda-tions as follows:-&quot;(l) It is desirable that we should be ready tomake a more specific and more substantialoffer to the United States.   No such offer should, however, be made pending the conclu-sion of the present Cano.dian-U.S .A. discus-sions at Washington, and without the empire governments concerned being informed of its terms .(2)  If we make such an offer, and if the UnitedStates agree that it provides a basis for negotiations, we shall be in a position topoint out to the Empire Governments concerned that the withholding of their assent will make further progress impossible.(3) As a basis for the offer referred to at (l)we are prepared to contemplate going as faras the concessions suggested in Colu::jn 5 of appendix B to the Annex hereto, on the under-standing that if and when an offer embodyingthem is made to the United States the following conditions shall be attached to it:-(a) that adequate concessions are made bythe United States,(b) that the agreement is in other respectss a t is fa ct o ry, and(c) that, where necessary, the empire governments concerned agree.On items 4, 5 and 7 we agree that the wordingin Column 5 should be modified on the lines indicated in paragraph 9.On item 15 (apples, tinned or bottled, pre-served without sugar) the figure recommendedby the Committee is 3/6 per ewt., not 3/- asproposed in Appendix B to the Annex hereto.
(4) The recommendation at (3) is subject to a reservation by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, who is unable to accept theview of the majority of the Committee as-regards three items in Appendix B.   TheMinister&apos;s view is that the maxi&quot;.um conces-sion on items 1 and 15 should be as followsItem 1. Apples, fresh or raw. 3/6 per ewt.Item 15.Apples, tinned or bottled, preservedwithout sugar 4/6 per  cwt.As regards item 17 - Hog Products - theMinister&apos;s view is that duty-free entry forhams should not be offered until the cabinet have taken a decision on the question of alevy subsidy for bacon.(5)  In addition, we recommend the use as a bargaining counter in the United Statesnegotiations of an offer on our part toremove the duty on wheat.    The question of reducing the duty on flour is being further discussed between the Departments concerned.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs handed round two telegrams Nos. 371 and 372 (Appendix) from theCharge drAffaires at Washington reporting a change inthe prospects of the negotiations between the United Statesand Canadian Governments at WashingtonThe President of the Board of Trade described the rapid changes in the situation that had occurred since he had presented his original memorandum.      In viewof the latest telegrams, it seemed that the time was approaching when His MajestyTs Government must say howfar they were prepared to go towards the &quot;essentialdemands&quot; of the American Government,.Several members of the Cabinet demurred to themethod of negotiation under which we were asked to agreeto the American essential conditions before the negotiation of the treaty could begin.      On the other hand, it was realised that there was some advantage in being placed inthe position of saying &quot;We will give so much provided we get a quid pro quo.     what are you prepared to do?&quot;The President of the Board of Trade suggestedthat in view of the latest telegrams, the following passage
in the conclusions (paragraph 12 (1)) of the CabinetCommittee&apos;s Report, namely -&quot;No offer should, however, be made pendingthe conclusion of the present Canadian-U.S.A.discussions at Washington^ and without theEmpire Governments concerned being informed of its terras,&quot;should be amended to read -&quot;No such offer should, however, be made without the Empire Governments concernedbeing informed of its terms.&quot;He asked for authority to make an offer within theterms of conclusion ((.3)    of the Cabinet Committee&apos;sreport in consultation with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs on matters of detail and procedure.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said it was possible that an awkward situation might arise with the Dominions0     If, however, /-heywas- givenreasonable warning, it might be possible to avoid this.He would like as much as a week&apos;-s warning.     That,however, fell within the request of the President of theBoard of Trade that he should confer with the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and himself as to thesematters of procedure.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesfirst explained his attitude towards the whole question.This was partly departmental with a view to ensuring that the treaty was not purchased at the expense ofBritish agriculture.     He also had to bear in mind,however, that in the present position in the House ofCommons,  the Government&apos;s policy was liable to be- 12 -
criticised,.      He recalled that negotiations with theUnited States had begun by a demand on their part for&quot;essential&quot; concessions by this country irrespective of what they would give in return.     He himself had onlywanted to ensure that the Cabinet should see the pictureas a whole,and it was to bring out our position that hehad asked for a concession as to -loganberries which initself was a small thing,-. At the Cabinet Committeehe had been told that at present we were only trying tofind out whether we could enter on a negotiation,.     if at this stage, however, we were to offer concessions,we should never be able to get away from them.Turning to the question of apples,  fresh or raw,he believed that the Canadians were prepared to offer3s. 6d. as a maximum concession,,     He was prepared to dothe same.      The loganberries appeared to be a trivial matter,tout-under our present protection arrangements, a system ofcanning had grown up of considerable dimensions and was still growing rapidly,.     He asked the Cabinet to bear inmind the difference between the position cf;theDominions and that of the United States.     The Dominionsproduced primarily for our market and were interested thatour market should not collapse.      The United Statesproduced for their home market and only wanted to dumptheir surplus here. \ In pleading for berries, he waspleading for the bottling industry.     He had raised thisquestion of berries at the Cabinet Committee, but had not actually made a reservation on the point.     We did not like making a concession without knowing what we wereto get in return and, for this reason, he objected to thewhole method of negotiation,,
The Minister for Go-Ordination of Defencedid not see that the method of negotiation was open tothe objections urged against it, as the &quot;essential18concessions would not be made in the absence of anadequate quid pro quo.The President of the Board of Trade agreed thatthe method of negotiation was a most unsatisfactory one.We had tried to alter it last April but were unable to dobo.     It was, therefore, barren to discuss it further.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries would have anopportunity next April to consider whether, on balance, the concessions were worth making.,     Great caution had to beexercised.      So far we had only offered concessions overa very limited field.     One of his experts had been in washington for the last three months and had sent warning that, in his opinion, the concessions in column (5) of appendix B to C.P. 251 (37) were the minimum which would offer any chance of securing the opening of negotiations.In reply to the Secretary of State for India as to what he would negotiate about if the concessions in column (5)of Appendix B were to be the minimum, he said that the eventual negotiations would embrace the large industrialconcessions that the United States were offering,and counter concessions in the industrial field that theywould ask from us.     The point was that the Americansstipulated that unless their &quot;essential&quot; concessionswere granted, they would not negotiate at all.     TheCabinet Committee proposed to offer the concessions setforth in column (5) of Appendix B.The Lord President of the Council said everyonewanted a treaty.     While he sympathised with the Minister
of Agriculture and Fisheries, he thought that if negotiations for a treaty could not start without agreeing to accept 3s. on apples, there seemed no alternative butto adopt this proposal,,     The larger issue must over-ridethe smaller.The President of the Board of Trade said thatthe Dominions would not make concessions if we would not make this concession on apples and, consequently, thismatter was very closely watched in America.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said this was a very important point.     The dominions would not make concessions unless we made some.     He feltgreat sympathy with the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, but he thought we ought to go as far as 3s.on apples if Canada would do the same.     He was impressed by the fact that those who had returned from Washingtonsaid it was essential to go to 3s. on apples.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries feltgreat sympathy with the attitude of the Lord Presidentof the Council.     He agreed that we must be guided by thepeople on the spot, but it was essential that the cabinet should realise our own difficulties.     A pistol was put at our heads, namely, that we could have no treaty unless we could go to 3s. for apples.     He said that we were beirxgbluffed and pushed along a road,  the end of which we couldnot see.     Nevertheless, he would be prepared to agree togo to 3s. on apples on the understanding that we should only make a concession if the Canadians did the same.The President of the Board of Trade appreciated the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries comparisonI between the attitude of the United States and the Dominionstowards the British market.     He proposed to insert in the
treaty some general anti-dumping clause similar tothat included in the Canadian treatyo     If the Canadiansshould secure 3s.6d. as the duty on apples, we- should get the same.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that theCanadian Government ought to he informed &quot;before we made an offer.     While he expressed great sympathy with theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries, he thought theCabinet were now prepared to agree to the recommendationof the Committee on apples.      It must he clear that wewere not going to he pushed further down the hill inthese negotiations.The Cabinet then turned to the question ofhog products.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said that bacon and hams at present came in duty free,though they were subject to a quantitative limitation.He supposed that that could be altered.      The wholequestion of a levy subsidy for bacon, however, wasunder consideration by an official committee,, and hethought it would be wise not to prejudice the result oftheir enquiry by making an offer of a duty free entry for hams..     However, in view of the urgency which had now arisen, he thought perhaps he ought to give way andto take the risk,The President of the Board of Trade thankedthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries^Wheat and Flour0The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said that this was a question of considerable gravityand he could not agree to drop the duty on flour.     This
proposal was on a different footing from the othersuggested concessions and raised difficulties of a fundamental character,,     He had no objection toabandoning the duty on wheat,for producers in thiscountry were protected by a system of guaranteed prices.     This concession was likely to be moredifficult to the Chancellor of the Exchequer than to himself.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said it involved about  1,000,000 a year, but he had to face itThe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriescontinued that the present protection to agriculturerested on the guaranteed price system which was workedby the millers *      Both the port and inland millershad pressed for years for the exclusion of foreignflour as all milling could, be done here.      They weresupported by the agricultural industry who wanted theoffals for feeding pigs and poultry0     As the price ofoffals went up, so did their pressure for this increaseIf, therefore, the Government agreed to a reductionin the duty on flour, that would antagonise the millers and the greater part of agricultural opinion,on the ground that it would increase the shortage inthe supply of offals.     He recalled that this proposal was not included in the original American demand, butthat it was to be substituted by us for tobacco 0The &amp;&amp;e&amp;*&amp;e^ said thatflour had so far never been mentioned to the UnitedStates Government, but that we had been informed thatthe United States Government would not regard wheat asa major concession without the inclusion of flour.For example, in telegram No. 371, paragraph 4, it was- 17 w
suggested that the United States officials intended torecommend acceptance of the Canadian proposal with theexception of ...... discussion with the United kingdom on tobacco and with the inclusion of wheat&apos; etc.       Alsoin paragraph 5, the possible addition of wheat to the&quot;essential&quot; list was referred to.     In neither case wasflour mentioned.     He suggested that the Cabinet might decide to proceed with the proposals without includingflPJour.The President of the Board of Trade agreed thatthe question of flour might be reserved until it was raised.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesaccepted this proposal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that thePresident of the Board of Trade would, of course, beauthorised to bring the question of flour back to theCabinet if it should be raised in the course of the negotiations.The Cabinet agreed:(a)    To approve the first three recommendations in CP. 251 (37), paragraph 12, in thefollowing form (viz. with the modificationof (l) mentioned above)(l)    It is desirable that we shouldbe ready to make a more specificand more substantial offer tothe United States.     No suchoffer should, however, be made without the Empire Governmentsconcerned being informed of its terms.(2)   If we make such an offer, and ifthe United States agree that it provides a basis for negotiations,we shall be in a position to pointout to the Empire Governmentsconcerned that the withholding oftheir assent will make further progress impossible.
(3)   As a basis for the offer referredto at (l) we are prepared to contemplate going as far as the concessions suggested in Column (5) of appendix B to the Annex hereto, onthe understanding that if and when an offer embodying them is made tothe United States the following conditions shall be attached to it:-(a) that adequate concessions aremade by the United States,(b) that the agreement is in other respects satisfactory, and(c) that, where necessary, theEmpire Governments concernedagree.On items 4, 5 and 7 we agreethat the wording in Column (5)should be modified on the lines indicated in paragraph 9*On item 15 (apples, tinned orbottled, preserved without sugar)the figure recommended by theCommittee is 3s06d. per cwt., not3s, as proposed in Appendix B tothe Annex hereto,(b)    To approve the use as a bargaining counterin the United States negotiation of an offer on our part to remove the duty on wheat,     A reduction on the duty on flourshould not be included in the offer.If the removal of the duty on flour shouldbe insisted on by the United StatesGovernment as essential, the President ofthe Board of Trade should be at liberty to bring the question back to theCabinet.(c)     To take note that the President of theBoard of Trade proposed to include inthe eventual treaty, a provision similarto that included in the Trade Agreementwith Canada providing against dumping,(dj     That the President of the Board of Trade,in consultation with the Secretaries of Statefor Foreign Affairs and Dominion Affairs,should have authority to make an offer to theUnited States Government on the above lines.
8.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (CP.-254 (37.))   circulatingfor the information of his colleagues a Note containing a summary of the provisions of a draft Revolutionary.Movements Ordinance which the Governor-General had had- drawn up in consultation with Provincial Governors as a comprehensive measure ready for immediate and general application should a. civil emergency arise in India.The Secretary of State was not now asking for formalapproval for the issue of the Ordinance if the e3iiorgeneyshould arise, but he would like to be in a position toinform the Governor-General that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentapproved generally the application of a measure on theselines as a matter of policy in the event of the occur-rence of a widespread revolutionary movement directed against Government, on the understanding that if theoccasion arose the matter would be brought before theCabinet again before final approval was given to theissue of the Ordinance.At the end of a statement explaining that hisobject in preparing the draft had been that he mighthave a weapon in his armoury in case of difficulties arising in India, the Secretary of State for Indiapointed out that when a da.ngerous situation did arise inIndia this usually happened with great rapidity.    If suchan emergency should arise when the Cabinet was not in regular session, he would like to have authority to take action subject to the approval of the Prime Minister.The Home Secretary agreed that it was of thegreatest importance that the provisional Ordinance shouldbe comprehensive in character.   He asked the Secretary,of State to bear in mind the danger of a leakage, moreespecially as everything was apt to leak in. India.
The Lord President of the Council agreed.    If theterms of the Ordinance were to be examined item by itemit might be that some passages might shock some of hiscolleagues;   but if it were ever required it would be foran emergency somewhat resembling a state of war, and hethought it was better that it should include every weaponwhich experience could suggest.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that thepreparation of the Ordinance had begun under the threat ofa menace that was almost immediate.    The situation was nowentirely different.   He suggested, therefore, that the message to the Government of India should be so framed asto make clear that it had not been prepared in anticipation of an immediate menace but only for an emergency which,though not likely to arise, could not be dismissed fromthe range of possibilities.Subject to the discussion summarised above, theCabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for India shouldbe authorised to inform the Governor-Generalof India that Kis Majesty&apos;s Government has approved generally the application of ameasure on the lines suggested in CP.-254(37) as a, matter of policy in the event ofthe occurrence of a widespread revolutionary movement directed against the Government:(b) That the above approval was on the understand-ing that if the occasion arises, the matterwill be brought before the Cabinet again before final approval is given to the issueof the Ordinance, subject to the exceptionthat if the Cabinet is not in regular session the Secretary-y of State for India should have authority to deal with the matter in consulta-tion with the Prime Minister:(c) That in notifying the Governor-General as above, the Secretary of State for india should intimate that the Cabinet did notrega.rd the draft Ordinance as one prepared in anticipation of any immediate menace, but rather as a pr.ecautiona.ry measure preparedfor a possible emergency which, though not likely to arise at present, could not be ruled out of 8,account.

The Cabinet had before them, the Report (C.P.-247 (37)) of the Cabinet Committee on Arabic Broad-casting, which had been appointed at the Meetingfirst mentioned in the margin. The recommendationssubmitted by the Committee at the end of the Reportv.- e r e as foil or: s : -&quot;(l) That Cyprus should not be adopted as a centre at vrhich to erect a sta.tion forArabi c Broad cas ting.(2) That the Cabinet should accept the prin-ciple of broadcast.    . messages in foreignlanguages being sent out from this country.(3) That these broadcasts should be carried outby the British Broadcasting Corporation,who should in principle retain, in respectof them, the same independent position thatthey possess in regard to their presentbroadcast services, and should accept responsibility for the delivery of allmatter sent out in connection with broad-easts in foreign languages .(4) That,  in pra.ct.iee, having regard to thespecial position of the Foreign Office Inrelation to broadcasts in a foreignlanguage addressed to listeners in othercountries, the Corporation should undertaketo maintain close touch with that department in all matters affecting such broadcasts  particularly those in Arabic   and to do their best to meet the Department&apos;s views.This understanding should be incorporated in a &apos;gentleman&apos;s agreement&apos;, which might take the form of an exchange of lettersbetween the Director-General of the Corpora-tion and the Permanent Under-Secretary ofthe Foreign Office.(5) That the Corporation should take all possible steps to dissociate broadcasts in a foreignlanguage from the Empire Service.(6) That a start should be made as early aspossible with broadcasts from this  countryin Spanish and Portuguese, and, subject tothe completion of arrangements for a newtransmitter, in Arabic.(7) That no special payment should be made tothe Corporation from the Exchequer forbroadcasts in a.foreign language, but thatany representations for financial assistance by the Corporation should be submitted onthe basis of the existing Agreement betweenthe Postmaster-General and the B.3.C. (Cmd.5329), and should be considered by theTreasury and the Post Office on their merits.While the final settlement should be amatter for negotiation, it must be assumed-22-
that the greater part, if not the whole, ofthe cost of the new service will ultimatelyfall on the Exchequer.(8) That detailed arrangements for the new service should he worked out with theB.B.C. by the Departments concerned, viz..;-The Treasury, the Foreign Office, theDominions Office, the India Office,the Colonial Office and the Post Office.&quot;The Minister of Health, as Chairman of the CabinetCoiamittee, explained the Committee&apos;s proposals, and at theend of his statement asked that the Cabinet Committee..nightbe kept in being in case of any difficulty arising in thecourse of the negotiations.   He suggested that, as he hadbeen connected with this matter, he and the Postmaster-General should communicate the decision of the Cabinet tothe British Broadcasting Corporation.The Postmaster-General concurred with the Minister ofHealth.    In the course of his statement he informed theCabinet that in practice the B.B.C. would keep in close contact with the Foreign Office.    If, however, a difficultyshould arise and the B.B.C. should refuse to broadcast whatthe Foreign Office desired, power remained to the Govern-ment to insist, though in that case the B.B.C. were entitledto state that their announcement was made at the request ofthe Government.The question was raised as to how the B.B.C. were tobe prevented from making announcements on their own responsibility-responsibility which were not in the public interest.The Postmaster-General said that the Government hadthe right to stop any broadcast.It was pointed out, however, that the broadcast mightbe made without the Government being informed beforehand.The Minister of Health said&apos; that this question couldbe arranged.   He did not want to be put in a position of having to announce that the Government could control the
B.B.C.   He thought, however, that the matter could besettled by means of a &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot;, which wouldgive better results than the exercise of formal powers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it very important that the Foreign Office should keep in close touch with what the B.B.C. were going to broadcast inthese programmes. A bona-fidc mistake, based pcirhaps onPress Agency reports, might do great damage.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs warmlythanked the Minister of Health and his  colleagues on theCabinet Committee for their Report.   We were somewhat late in coming into this matter, but the proposals would be ofgreat value from the point of view of foreign policy.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat the proposals of the Cabinet Committee should not interfere with the Empire Broadcast.   He thought it wasvery importa.nt that the broadcasts should be introduced by an announcement which would allajr any suspicions that-the Empire Broadcast was to be interfered witThe Minister of Health suggested that the matter was.of such importance that the Prime Minister should beasked to announce the new broadcasts in the House ofCommons.The Seereta.ry of State for Dominion Affairs asked that there shorLld be no extension of the system to other,languages without consultation with all the GovernmentDepartments  concerned.The Lord&apos; Cha.ncellor said that in his recent visit to South America he had detected a strong desire on thepart of pro-British people for something of this kind,and, although he had not been aware of what the CabinetCommittee was going to propose,, he had come back with theview that something of the kind ought- to be done.   Hethought the Foreign Office ought to keep careful watchon the natter broadcast by the B.B.C.
The Cabinet agreed.

HOUSING. 10. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLegislation      Minister of Health (CP.-250 (37)) on the subject of on.Legislation on Housing, in which he pointed out the(Previous need for legislation relating to Exchequer contribu-Reference:Cabinet 14 tions payable for slum clearance and the abatement of(36), Con-elusion 9.) overcrowding.   For this purpose he asked authority toprepare and submit to the Committee of Home Affairs71 ;y7a Bill -&quot; 3(3^) J.(a) To implement the promise to continueExchequer contributions on the existingbasis for houses completed between the31st March, 1938, and the 31st December,1938:(b) To authorise contributions on a new basis(i.e., that for houses completed after31st December,  1938, the Exchequer eon-tributions payable for slum clearanceand the abatement of overcrowding shouldbe of equal amount, with payment basedon the number of new houses built) for afurther period of approximately threeyears from 31st December, 1938:(e)  To provide for Exchequer contributions towards the general housing needs ofagricultural workers.In,the course of a short discussion the Ministerof Labour asked that the Building trade/Cou^eil- mightbe notified in advance of the introduction of thelegislation contemplated in this item of the Cabinet&quot;sAgenda for England, and in the following item forScotland.A short discussion took place on the subject ofthe possibility of re-conditioning houses instead ofbuilding new ones.    It was suggested that in townsthere was a tendency to pull down houses which might easily be re-conditioned, in order to obtain the grant for a new house.   On the other hand, it was suggestedthat re-conditioning houses, though appropriate in rural areas, was not equally applicable to the case of towns, and was apt to result in a subsidy to the privateowner.
On the whole it was thought better not to open thequestion in connection with the Bills now before theCabinet.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Health should have authority to prepare and submit to theCommittee of Home Affairs a Bill for thepurposes stated in CP.-250 (37) ands ummari sed ab ove.-37-
11. The Cabinet had before then a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland (CP.-242 (37)) askingauthority to prepare and submit to the Committee of HomeAffairs a Bill to give effect to the following recommend-ations of the Scottish Ho^^sing Advisory Committee:-(a) In addition to the subsidies now given forslum clearance and to put an end to over-3n)s crowding, assistance should be given to// &apos; County Councils to erect houses to meet thegeneral needs of the agricultural population.(b) County Councils should be empowered to givegrants to owners to replace unfit tiedcottages on farms occupied by agricultural workers, where it is clear that the workersmust be housed on the farm.   The exchequer should meet three-quarters of the cost ofthe grants.^ c^ County Councils should be empowered to givegrants to the owner occupiers or the landlordsof certain cla.sses of small agricultural hold-ings to enable them to replace unfit houseson the holdings.    The Exchequer would meetthree-quarters of the expenditure on suchgrants, except in the Highlands and Islands,where the Exchequer share would be seven-eighths .The Secretary of State added that the proposals containedin his Memorandum, which also included estimates of costto the Exchequer, had been discussed with the chancellor and the Minister of Health, who had raised no objections.This Bill was taken simultaneously with theprevious item.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for scotland should have authority to prepare and submit to the Committee of Home affairs a Bill to give effect to the recommenda-tions of the Scottish Housing AdvisoryCommittee quoted above;CSee also the -request of the Minister of Labourreferred to in finnmnsinm^
LONDON TRAFFICPROBLEMS.Rels.tionswith theLondon CountyCouncil.waterloo bridge.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(37), Con-clusion 11.)12.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP.-243 (37)) on the subjectof London Traffic Problems and Relations with theLondon County Council,  consideration of which had been postponed at the previous Meeting.In this Memorandum the Minister pointed out that ifprogress was to be made in the solution of the diffi-culties connected with the Greater London Area and itsaccompanying traffic facilities and traffic congestion,cordial co-operation between the London County Counciland the Ministry of Transport was essential.   unfortunate-nately, relations between the two bodies had recentlynot been as good as they might be, and this was largely,if not wholly, due to the dispute over Waterloo Bridge.He himself saw no advantage in continuing a uselessvendetta on this matter, and therefore suggested that,in return for a full programme of collaboration by theCouncil in the Government&apos;s highway improvement schemes in the Metropolis, he should be authorised to approach the Council with an offer of a 60 per cent, grant(which would mean something in the neighbourhood of 400,000) towards the cost of the new Waterloo Bridge.At the some time he would make clear to the council that he was not prepared to make any contribution towardsthe cost of demolishing the old bridge, as this work had been carried out in defiance of the wishes of theGovernment.The subject was discussed both in its practical and political aspects.    It was urged that the concession to the Party which at present predominated in theLondon County Council would be of considerable politicalvalue to them.    It was essential that the Governmentshould get an adequate quid pro quo *
In this connection, besides the natters refer:? ed toin the Minister of Transport&apos;s Memorandum, namely, &quot;a full programme of collaboration by the Council in the Govern-ment&apos;s highway improvement schemes in the Metropolis&quot;,co-operation ought to be secured in Air Raid Precautions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed the matter with the Prime Minister, who took the view that the proposal was not tolerable by itself,but that the offer would be desirable as part of a generalaccommodation.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That they were prepared to approve what was proposed by the Minister of Transport in cp.-243 (3 7)  as part of a. general aceommo-dation, though they were not at presentcommitted in detail.&apos;(b) That no public announcement of this policy should be made during the present month.(NOTE: The Cabinet adjourned at this point until3ol5 p.m. in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room atthe House of Commons. )
The Cabinet reassembled in the Prime Minister&apos;room at the House of Commons at 3.15 p.m.     All members were present except the Minister of Health, who was absent on duty.13.    The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland (CP.-253 (37)) seeking authority to prepare and submit to the Committee of Home Affairs a Bill togive effect to the main recommendations of the RiverdaleCommittee on the Re-organisation of the Fire BrigadeServices.      The Memorandum set forth the main heads ofthe proposed Bill, which the Ministers suggested shouldbe introduced as early as possible in the House of Lordsafter consultation with representatives of the LocalAuthorities on administrative details.      They added thatit was desirable that the recommendations should apply in Scotland as well as in England and Wales.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed theindebtedness of the Government to Lord Riverdale and his committee for their arduous labours.The Cabinet agreed:-To authorise the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland toprepare and submit to the Committee ofHome Affairs a Bill to give effect tothe main recommendations of theRiverdale Committee on there-organisation of the Fire Brigadeservices.

SUPERANNUATION        15.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by(VARIOUS SER-VICES) BILL. the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-249 (37))seeking authority for the introduction of a Super-(previous reference: annuation (Various Services) Bill, designed to conferCabinet 36j^3 7), Con- on certain Departments, mentioned in the Memorandum,elusion 11and Appendix.)    any powers which they at present lack to apply thecomplete Civil Service pension code to their staffs .The Cabinet agreed:-To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer to introduce v.heSuperannuation (Various Services)Bill for the purposes set forth in cp.-249 (37).
16c      The Cabinet had before the:;:, a Memorandum by theN.Minister of Transport (CP.-252 (57))  covering an outline of Proposals summarising the principal heads of a Billfor securing the reorganisation of electricity distribu-) tion, on the general lines recommended in the Report offi^he Cabinet Committee (CP.-64 (37)).    This Outline of proposals had been circulated confidentially to repre-sentative organisations of the Electrical Supply Industry,Local Authorities, trade and agriculture, and in his memorandum the Minister described the manner of itsreception by these bodies and their criticisms of it,which fastened in particular upon certain departures fromthe recommendations of the McGowan Committee.   He alsoset forth the objections raised as to the scope of there organisation and the general lines on which it was toproceed.   After giving a full appreciation of the positionas he novr saw it in the light of the representations hehad received, his recommendation to the Cabinet was thata Bill to deal with the reorganisation of the distributionof electricity supply should be promised in the King&apos;sSpeech, and that he might be authorised to incorporatein the Bill, which was in process of being drafted, certain amendments to the legislative proposals contained in theOutline, designed to maintain as fair a balance aspossible between the conflicting interests.   He thoughtthat these amendments would go some way towards meetingopposition.In the course of a short statement the Minister ofTransport pointed out that he had departed from therecommendations of the Cabinet Committee by adoptingprocedure by Provisional Order and not by Special Order.His proposals would give the right to those concerned to
be represented by counsel. &quot; &quot;He had adop&quot;ted,thisproposal with the object of limiting some of theopposition to the scheme as a whole, though he did notconceal from his colleagues that strong objections wouldbe raised.      If his proposals were adopted the procedurehe contemplated was as follows:-(1) To draft a Bill.(2) To discuss it with the GovernmentDepartments concerned and theCommittee of Home Affairs.(3) To introduce it into Parliament, butthat its introduction should be/su^C /tktnUsL^ concerned would--ere-stsThe Lord President of the Council, as Chairmanof the Cabinet Committee,  said that the question of whether to proceed by Provisional Order or by SpecialOrder had been a matter on which he and his colleagues had had rather open minds.      He did not suppose that anyof them would object to the alteration.The Secretary of State for War said the reasonfor the eventual recommendation had been that procedure by Provisional Order was likely to lead to a flood ofobjections.The Minister of Transport hoped to surmount thisby dealing with the -ob^s&amp;ti-en-s in groups.The Minister- of Agriculture and Fisheries, whohad accepted the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee,said he was now prepared to accept procedure by provisional order.    Although this involved some risk of delay,, theprocess was an expensive one and most objectors would prefer to settle if possible.
The President of the Board of Trade warned theCabinet that the fiercest opposition must be expected.He mentioned a case in his own area where there were one large municipality,  two small municipalities and oneelectrical company.      As he understood the proposals ofthe Minister of Transport, it would be possible for oneof the municipalities to buy out the company, but it wouldnot be possible for the three municipalities to formthemselves into a joint board which would buy them out.If one of the three were to buy up the company it wouldhave to carry the whole financial responsibility, evenif it were afterwards to form a joint board with theother two.      One of the municipalities in question ranits electrical installations so successfully that notwithstanding that the charges were among the lowest inthe country the rates had been relieved to the extent ofl/- in the  .      The result of the fusion of thismunicipality would be that the rates would be raised by1/6 and the electricity costs would not be reduced.If that occurred widely in the country the political consequences would be very serious.      He was informed by those concerned that they had ascertained from theMinistry of Transport that this was the position.The Minister of Transport had doubts as to whether theposition was quite as stated.      He undertook to look intothe matter, and-i,f. nprpRfsany-t-q modify hi^^m^e-saJL&amp;e^Qmeet - the diff icul-ty.The Cabinet agreed;-(a) To authorise the Minister of transport to prepare a Bill to deal with there-organisation, of the distribution ofelectricity supply, as already promisedin the King&apos;s Speech, on the lines proposed in CP.-252 (37).(b) That the Minister of Transport shouldtake into account the matter, raised bythe President of the Board Of Trade inthe course of the discussion.

It was suggested that the Lord Chancellor&apos;sproposals would he criticised for what they did not contain rather than for their actual contents.     Forexample, there was the suggestion of a business managerfor the Lord Chief Justice.The Lord Chancellor explained that thedifficulty was that the Lord Chief Justice had givenevidence against the proposal and strongly objected toits application to himself.The general view of the Cabinet was that ifcriticism were raised, the position of the Governmentshould be stated frankly,  though it would be more convenient to do this in the House of Commons than inthe House of Lords.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the recommendation of theCommittee of Home Affairs as setforth above.

PISHfouSTRYfreviousteference:fabinet 8j37) Conclu-lion 10.28.    The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland, covering a draft SeaPish Industry Bill - H. A. 43 (37),  together with thefollowing Conclusion of the Committee of Home affairs thereon :-&quot;To invite the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State forScotland to give further consideration tothe draft Sea Fish Industry Bill in thelight of the above discussion,  in consulta-tion with all the Departments affected, witha view to its being brought forward again,-if possible, at the next meeting of theHome Affairs Committee. &quot;The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries brought the matter forward as a matter of urgency.      He said thatthe Prime Minister had asked that the Ministers concerned should bring this Bill forward to meet a shortage ofbusiness.      To meet this obligation he had lost no timein his discussions with the Board of Trade.        Since themeeting of the Committee of Home Affairs, four points had emerged, one of which was of sufficient invoortariee for him to bring before the Cabinet.      He recalled that anannouncement had been made in Parliament in terms approvedby the Cabinet to the effect that a Sea Commission wouldbe set up for the Sea Fish Industry.      Rather late inthe day the Treasury had suggested that the commission should not be permanent, but only for five years,,      then the Board of Trade had suggested that the Commissionought to have, as part of its functions, protection of theinterests of the general public and that as it was onlyto exist for five years that point would not be covered.In an endeavour to meet both points of view,  the Bill wasonly applicable for five years.      He himself preferred a
permanent Commission and had only accepted the compromise with reluctance to meet the Treasuryobjection to paying for the Commission beyond fiveyears, and in view of the Prime Minister&apos;s desire that the Bill should be ready for introduction.      Atthe meeting of the Committee of Home Affairs the fiveyears had been found inadvisable.      For example, he himself and the Secretary of State for Scotland would get much better men for the Commission if they were not limited to five years.      Moreover, at the end of fiveyears the position would become very nebulous.To try and meet the point of view both of theBoard of Trade and Treasury, a fresh compromise had beensuggested that for five years the Exchequer should bear the charges of the Commission, but that, at the end ofthat period, they should be paid from funds to beraised by the industry.      In his view that would notprotect the general public      He therefore asked theCabinet to return to what had been  implied   in theoriginal announcement in Parliament, namely a permanent commision.The Ministry of Labour said that the trawlingindustry v/ere looking to the Commission to become afocus for the whole industry.The   Chancellor of the Exchequer said that thepreoccupations of the Treasury were not solely financial.When the Commission had first been conceived and announced,it was to have certain powers, e.g.  the licensing ofwholesalers, which had now been dropped,,    Its principal objectnow was to create marketing schemes.     If in five years that
worked out successfully the Coianission would have justifieditself.   But it was all rather an experiment.   The Treasuryalso took the view that we should he chary of creating newCommissions with salaried staff and premises and which amountedpractically to Government Department s5 for all time.    In five years5if the Commission justified itself, that would he animportant consideration.      The new proposal, however,had only reached him on the previous day.      He had not had time to consult his Department and he could not givea final opinion.      He thought there was a good deal tobe said for the compromise under which the Commission wouldbe created without limit of time;   the Exchequer would finance itforthe first five years;   and thereafter it would become a charge on the industry.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that,of course he could not press the Chancellor of theExchequer for an immediate answer in the circumstances,but he recalled the Prime Minister&apos;s desire that theBill should be brought forward.The Lord Chancellor thought that possibly the matter was not now so urgent as it had been, as, in front ofthis Bill,  there would be the Cinematograph Bill and theAdministration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.The Cabinet agreed :-(a) That the Bill should be referred to thefollowing Ministers :-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,who, if they reached agreement, should beempowered to authorize the introduction ofthe Bill.(b) That,  if time permitted,  the Bill should bebrought before the Committee of Home affairs at its next regular weekly meeting.
29,   The Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments on the subject of Defence Expenditure in future years:-Forecasts submitted by the Defence Depart-ments and the Air Raid Precautions Depart-ment of the Home Office,  in consultationwith the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence, in accordance with the Conclu-sion first referred to in the margin(CP.-256 (37)),  taking in each case theform of tabular statements and a shortexplanatory memorandum:) 9- A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP,-257 (37)) containing asummary of the salient features of theposition disclosed by the above returns,together with some observations of a general character on the increase in the cost of modern armaments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a statement to the Cabinet,  in the course of which, by reference toTable I on page 2 of CP,  257 (37) and Table III on page 8,he illustrated the magnitude of the Defence Requirementsasked for by the Fighting Services.    At this moment, he did not propose to mention a figure which the nationcould afford.    He only wished to draw attention to a consideration which increased the gravity of the situation,namely,  that it was not going to be so easy to borrow thenecessary money as had been anticipated.    Even thematter of  60,000,000 involved in the Mining Royaltiesscheme had given grave anxiety to the Governor of the Bankof England.    Another consideration was that there had been no sinking fund since 1931 for the reason that it was no useborrowing money and paying off money at one and the samemoment.    That, however, was a very serious position, for theestablishment of some sinking fund as soon as possible was essential to the maintenance of our financial stability. Hehad made proposals to the Prime Minister as to procedure. he contemplated that there sho-ijld be rjo Cabinet Committee at the present time
as it might be very difficult to secure    rapidpractical results    in   that   way. He proposed,therefore,-    to take    full   advantage   of   the    existence and functions of the Minister for Co-ordination of defence and to refer the memoranda before the Cabinet to him.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence would have athis disposal a panel of officials, such as Sir maurice hankey, Sir Arthur Robinson, Sir Horace Wilson and two representatives of the Treasury and, on the military side,would consult with the Service Ministers who could bringwith them their professional advisers or not as they desire.The Minister would also have a free hand to consult anyother Minister or expert whom he desired.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had heard that some of the items approved in the service estimates could not be spent this year.      He hoped therewould not be any delay in such expenditure which, from thepoint of view of foreign policy, was vital.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence said there was no delay in contracts which were possib3.e of execution.     There was, however, some delay in contractsthat could not be completed for two or three years.      Itmight be necessary for him to pick out some very urgentit^ms which ought to be pressed on in advance of his final report after approval by the Treasury or the Cabinet.The task remitted to him was a most formidable one, and hewould have to ask the co-operation of his colleagues.The Secretary of State for Air welcomed theprocedure suggested.     Ultimately, it would be necessaryfor the Cabinet to take a decision in the light offinancial, international, trade and real strategicalconsiderations.     It would help all three Service Ministers
If the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence would, afterconsultation, give them his conception of the realstrategical necessities.     Speed was of the essence of thecase.In reply to the Home Secretary, who also had expressed approval of the arrangement, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence could send interim reports to the Cabinet.The Home Secretary said it had emerged inrecent discussions that policy and strategy went hand inhand.      He hoped that the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence would keep that aspect in view.The Secretary of State for War agreed.     he hoped that part of the duty of the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence would he to select certain measures that, for one reason or another, had   got behind hand,for example, Anti-Aircraft Defence and Man-Power (theArmy were 1^- Divisions short in Man-power).The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence saidthat he would probably   have to pick out certain items for early expenditure.      He would, however, only pick outthose items which, irrespective of other expenditure, mustbe proceeded with at once.The Cabinet agreed;(a)    To refer the papers CP. 256 (37) and cp, 257 (37) for a full reportcontaining his recommendations, to thethe Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence, who would consider them inconsultation with representatives ofthe Treasury and such others as hemay from time to time invite includingpolitical Ministers specially concerned:
(b)   That the Minister for Go-Ordinationof Defence should have discretion to send interim reports to theCabinet on matters of specialurgency^Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.27th October, 1937.
APPENDIX.NO DISTRIBUTION.Decipher.      Mr. Mallet.    (Washington)October 28 th,   1937.D.      0.35 p. in.      October 26th, 1937.R.      9.20 a. rn,      October 27th,  1937.No. 371.MOST IMMEDIATE.My telegram No. 367.      Following from commercial counsellor.      Begins:1.      State Department officials summoned me pressinglyyesterday afternoon to talk over situation left byCanadians.      In view of paragraph 4 of your telegramNo. 459, before going I said implications of this situation were so complicated that I had not yet had time to thinkthem out clearly, still less to receive any views orinstructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government and although Iwas of course ready to listen to anything they wished tosay, any views I might express must be taken as preliminaryand strictly personal, not committing even myself and notat all His Majesty&apos;s Government or other Governments.    Theywillingly accepted this condition, making it reciprocal.I was met hy Messrs. Hawk. ....  Hid...  and Pagvolsky.2.      There is no divergence at any material point inUnited States officials&apos; understanding of Canadian proposals as reported in our telegram Nos. 360 and 367.      Inparticular they confirm paragraphs 2,  5 and 4 of telegramNo.360 and (? agreed with 2) the second part of 3 andwhole of 3 of telegram No. 367.3.      With regard to paragraph 4 of telegram No.367United States officials admit they had hoped to send
this information to Ottawa within a few days hut nowintend to inform Ottawa that it must be deferred until they had nade further progress with study which they arenow making at full pressure of particular concessions which united    States   would require from Canada in a comprehensiveagreement of scope proposed.-,4.      The attitude of United States officials to canadian proposals is now considerably more favourable than indicated to Canadians.      They are &quot;heartened&quot; bythem.      In fact, no doubt is left in my mind that they intend to recommend their acceptance as a basis toSecretary of State with exception of apples,  of something more on lumber,  of discussion with United Kingdom, ontobacco, and with inclusion of wheat, and provided Governmentsof United Kingdom,    Australia, rlew Jealand and South Africa&quot;come into line&quot;,  in regard to iter.:s on &quot;essential&quot; listwhich affects them.      They forecast nothing whatever as todecision which President and Llinisters may take on what isa major political issue.5.      It appeared that real motive of meeting was toascertain if I could help United States officials inreporting to their Ministers whether United Kingdom andother empire countries,  especially Australia,  could be counted on to &quot;cone 100.   into line&quot; on items of &quot;essential&quot;list plus wheat which had been discussed with Canadianofficials and on remaining items effecting primarily these other countries which had not been discussed.      I pointedout that Canada had not proposed to agree to 100;j ofUnited States require&apos; ients in first group.      What did100%   mean applied to second interests?     They preferred(?) not to be explicit.      I replied that all I could say at present as to attitude of United Kingdom and countries
other than Canada towards United States requirements in both groups was contained in written memoranda which wehad presented.      Since they pressed me I would give as mypersonal opinion, for what it was worth,  that they couldcount on other dominions co-operating with United kingdom to fullest extent within possibilities to facilitateUnited States-United Kingdom agreement provided theysecured simultaneous assurances from United States of concessions which United States would make in trade agreements with them.      A new factor had, however, been introduced into situation by Canadian proposals, viz.  thepossible necessity of simultaneous negotiations between canada and other dominions.      On that I could say nothing.6.      No   mention was   made   of United States requirements from United Kingdom in their &quot;long&quot; lists of September28th and October 5th,7,      I think recommendations which United States officialswill put up to their Ministers will contemplate simultaneousand early negotiations in Washington by United States with united Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica.      The problem was expressed as &quot;whether Presidentwill swallow the pill or bite it into five pieces.11Unfinished8.

In view of result of Australian elections UnitedStates Government are anxious to come to grips at once with commonwealth Government on question of licensingdiscrimination against United States, and remove Australiafrom United States list of countries from which tariff reductions made;    trade agreements are withheld.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 72 of 26th October,repeated to Ottawa telegram No. 24.
