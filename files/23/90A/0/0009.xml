SPAIN. 2.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the[jje Refugee Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP--302 (37))on Questions arising from the Refugee Problem in Spain.Iroblem,pervious After describing in some detail the relief work alreadyReference:Cabinet 45 accomplished, the Secretary of State summed up his(57), Con-conclusion 3. proposals as follows:-f-R.u-s (\) That the steamship G-TBEL ZERJON fwhosepresent  charter ends on the 19th December)should, be withdrawn from evacuation service:(2) ^hat with a view to equalising the humanitarian-tarian services afforded by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as between the two sides in theSpanish conflict, the Foreign Office shouldbe authorised to contribute  2^,000 towards an organisation formed under the auspices ofthe Society of Friends for the purpose of feeding Spanish children who have been drivenfroro their homes as a result of the civil war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat the above memorandum had not been communicatedbeforehand to the Treasury as laid down in the Cabinetrules of procedure.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsregretted this but said that owing to great pressure ofwork he had not handled this question himself.      He&quot;undertook to make enquiries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while regrettingto raise difficulties on a proposal of a noble andhumanitarian character, expressed doubts as to whetherit should be adopted.     The amount involved was not large,but it was contrary to custom to ask the taxpayer tocontribute to relief measures of this kind.     Thememorandum showed that as yet no organisation was inexistence.     The proposed contribution was for thepurpose of bringing it into existence.    The Soeiety ofFriends had proposed to set up an organisation but nomoney had yet been subscribed.     He recalled that whenthe Cabinet had been asked to sanction the chartering
Evacuation orChildren.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(37) Con-clusion 2. )of the steamship GIBEL ZERJON, one of the argumentsused was that it was intended to equalise the assistance we had given to &quot;both parties to the Spanish struggle.How the Cabinet were asked to do something else toequalise what had been done by the steamship.The Cabinet were reminded that the new proposal was to some extent connected with the matterof the Basque children brought to this country who werecosting  1,500 a month raised privately.      Money,however, was running out and if the Government were toadopt the proposal to make a contribution to themaintenance of children in Spain, they would be pressed to pay here also.In reply to the Prime Minister, the HomeSecretary said that those responsible for the^Ba^quechildren refused to give the addroooo-s- of the parents.He suggested that he should be authorised to insist onobtaining these a4d-r-esses and to get in touch with those concerned in the children&apos;s repatriation.      There were,however, difficulties in repatriation, owing in somecases to the removal of parents to other parts of spain and so forth.The Prime Minister agreed that everything possible should be done with a view to the repatriation ofthe Basque children.      It had always been realised inthe Cabinet that difficulties such as those mentionedwould occur.     While he recognised the force of theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s objections, he suggestedthat, apart from the humanitarian aspects of the foreign secretary^ proposal which appealed to him, there wereimportant political considerations.     We had to get on good terms with the Spain of the future and he thought the Spanish people might contrast the action of those
nations which had supplied arms to kill Spaniards and others whohad done something to help the people and especially thechildren.     He agreed with the Chancellor of the exchequer that if we were to make the proposed contribution of 25,000. it would be an advantage if we could obtaincontributions from other nations.After some further discussion, the cabinet agreed:(a)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should obtain more details of theproposal and circulate them to the cabinet with a view to a decision.      He should alsoput the Earl ufXCranbome in touch with theChancellor of the Exchequer on the subject:(b ) That the Home Secretary should take allpossible steps with a view to the earlyrepatriation of the Basque children.
THE PAR EAST.japan and china.proposed note to Japan.(previous reference:Cabinet 46 (5?)Conclusion 4* )3.     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that as soon as he heard of the recent attacks on British and American warships and other shipson the Yangtse, he had asked the American Charged&apos;Affaires to visit him.     He had pointed out tothe Charge dfAffaires the advantages of concerted action and had asked him to suggest to the AmericanGovernment that they should postpone sending their note to Japan until they had received a message which he was sending them through his Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington.     He had then senttelegram No. 591 to Sir Ronald Lindsay,     Not-withstanding this action, the American Governmenthad sent a note to Japan without consultation with us, though they had sent him an advance copy.      Thereason they gave for this was that they had learntthat the Japanese Government were themselves sending a note of apology and they wished to anticipate it.On the previous evening, he had sent to His Majesty&quot;*ambassador in Tokyo telegram No, 567 containing anote for communication to the Japanese Government.Before that had reached Tokyo, he had received anote of apology from the Japanese Government whichwas published in that day&apos;s Press (Tokyo telegramNo. 813).     The first question on which he wanted to consult the Cabinet, therefore, was as to what action he should take on the Japanese note.     Hehad held up action at Tokyo until he had had timeto read the Japanese note.     After doing so, hidinclination was to send our original note subject tosome minor modifications.,     In reply to a question,m*    5     &quot;**
he said that the action demanded in his note was similar to what the Japanese Government had already promised to accord to the Americans,,      The principalexception was the demand for the punishment of officers.In that respect, our case differed somewhat from thatof the Americans since our ships had been fired on byfield guns, whereas theirs had been bombed, and theJapanese War Office had already offered punishment.The Prime Minister thought that unless somepunishment could be secured, we should have no guarantee for any mitigation of these outrages in the future.The Foreign Secretary drew attention also tothe demand he was making for assurances of steps toensure that British Nationals1 ships and property inChina will not be subjected to further attacks orillegitimate interference.     This went beyond what theJapanese had offered.The Prime Minister said that the important thing was not to ask for more than the Americans.     Hethought, however, that the demand for punishment was justified by the difference in the forms of attack.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs(a) To despatch the note contained inhis telegram to Tokyo No. 667 of the14th December, subject to suchminor modifications as he deemed necessary in consequence of thereceipt of the Japanese note and thediscussion at the Cabinet:(b) To inform the House of Commons thata note had been received from japan and that a British note had been dispatched to Tokyo.
T. 4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to telegraphic messagesbetween the Governments of the United Kingdom and theUnited States of America, including the following:-Foreign Office &quot;elegra.^ No .591, of the13th December, to Washington, asking,among other things, for ear-ly information in the went of the United States Govern-/ ment taking any action of a menacingcharacter, such as the mobilisation of u.z their Fleet, or a part of it. with a view to despatch to the Far East:Washington ^el egram No. 464, giving the reply to the above telegram, but conta.in-ing no direct response by the State Depart-ment on the above point:Foreign Office Telegram No. 594 to washington in which it was pointed out that if nothing more than apologies were required for thesuccessive and increasing outrages theJapanese might be encouraged to go to lenqthswhich &quot;ieht face us with the necessity of taking drastic action, and instructing HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador to explain that what we had in mind, was that on such an occasionas this the two Governments might have proceeded for instance at least with somemeasures of mobilisation to show Ja.pa.nan&quot;1 the world that we were in earnest.Both he anr* the Prime Minister, whom he had consulted before sending this telegram, were very dubious as towhether the Government of the United States of america would feel able to a^opt any suggestions o^ the kind,but they ha&apos;&apos; felt it was necessary that that Governmentshould be informed as to what we had in mind.   He had had further consultations with the Prime Minister and first Lord of the Admiralty on the previous day, as theresult of which he had prepared a draft of a fresh tele-gram to Afashinston, indicating!; that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment now thought it necessary to make dispositionsenabling then to give weight to representations to theJapanese Government against the successive outrages!that they were considering the possibility of despatchinga Battle Fleet to Far Eastern waters!    that theyearnestly hoped the U.S./. Government would take similar action! and suggesting in that event that Naval staff conversations were desirable.-7-
The Prime Minister sale? that the draft telegram had been prepared as the result of conversations he had held, on the previous day with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs,  the First Lord and First Sea Lordo^ the Admiralty, and Sir Alexander Cadogan.   the telegram, however, was to have been drawn on the basis that we were prepared to send a force to the Far East*ut that we should not. act unless the United states were willing to do so.    This point was not  clear in thedraft telegram before the Cabinet, which, if approved in principle, would ha.ve to be amended to bring it outunmistakably.The First Lord, of the Admiralty expressed doubt as to whether it was necessary to send this telegram atall.    The first telegram had evoked, no satisfactory response.   He suggested that the American government might feel that they were being pressed too hard and.be irritated by a further telegram,   &quot;&quot;here was, inaddition, the danger of leakage..    On the whole hethought that to send a fresh message of the same kind would only exacerbate the situation.The Prime Minister suggested that if a telegramwere to be sent it might  contain a proposal somewhatshort of sending the Fleet:    e.g., a mobilisation, whichwould be easier for the American Government, and yetmiptht in itself be sufficient warning to the. Japanese.The question was raised, as to what would be theeffect of the despatch of a Fleet to the Far East onthe position vis-a-vis Italy in the Mediterranean.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it would,be necessary to arrange with the French Government tobe prepared, to look after the Mediterranean in theabsence in the Far ^ast. of our Fleet,   &quot;his would.
involve consultations, a.s trie French might have appropriate-e-*hens ions as to the safety of the Atlantic.At this point the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs reed a fresh telegram from His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington which hart only just reached him, the effect, of which was that, though the president and. the Secretary of State at Washington had been doing their best to bring American public opinion to rea.lisethe situation, they were not yet in a position to adoptany measures of the kind, now cont.empls.ted. The Secretaryof State remarked that it appeared, that some otherevent would have to happen before the American Govern-ment would &quot;he prepared to act    in the sense we were contemplating *The Secretary of State for India was convincedthat nothing, but a display of force would have anyinfluence on the Japanese.   He would advocate sending the dra^t telegram, hitching it on to the last sentence of the telegram just read from Washington, where itwas stated, that the Secretary of State would always beglad, to listen to anything we had to suggest.Another view was that it wss  clear from the tele-gram, just read to the Cabinet that, the American Govern-ment , though doing their best to bring home the facts ofthe situation to public opinion, had given us a stronghint that they did not want to he pressed at themoment, and consequently that the only result wouldhe to cause irritation.    There was also the danger&apos;ofleaka.se.
The Secretary of State for Foreign  ffairs saidthat in any event he would want to consult His Majesty&apos;aAmbassador in Washington before sending any further message .The Prime Minister said, that everyone would agree in that, but the question was as to the subject onwhich we were to consult  teem    It was clear to him,after listening to the telegram that had. just heen read,that we could not press the TJ.S, Government to despatchtheir Fleet to the Far East.    It might be said, however,that we had received evidence of loss of prestige in the&quot;A&quot; Far East affecting not only the United Kingdom but alsoall democracies.    Consequently we thought that some action ought to be taken to restore the situation.We reaiised the difficulties of the American Governmentowing to public opinion, but would not that Governmentperhaps be willing to consider mobilisation as a first step?    That might be sufficient in itself;    but if,nevertheless, further outrages should occur, the americans might then be able to do more.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that, &quot;mobilisation&quot; was rather a formidable wordand it mieht. be better to use some phra.se such as &quot; an improved state of readiness of the Fleet&quot;,In answer to a question/  the First. Lord of the Admiralty said that if theFleet in the Mediterranean was to move it would benecessary to call up rese^-vists, and three or four weekswould be necessary before it could, start.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggestedthat the Foreign Office should, keep in touch with theDominions Office, who might at the appropriate momentsend, a message to the Dominions, particularly toAustralia, and New Zealand, enquiring as to whether theywould be willine ^o co-operate.-10-
The question was raised as to whether, supposing that the American Government decided that there was nothing it  coul^ do and. the inaction of the two countriesw^s followed,       further crave incidents affecting our prestige, any British action coul^ ^e taken alone torectify the situation.    It was recalled that at the timeof the crisis in the Mediterranean the mere movement ofships in that Sea. had some effect.    Could anything corres-ponding be ^one in fhe Far Fast?The Prime Minister pointed out that in the Mediter-ranean v:e had already h^d a. strong Fleet at hand.In the. Pacific^ however, the position was quite differentas our Fleet was a long way off.    To produce a deterrent effect, on the Japanese it was useless to send only a few-ships, which might only tempt the hothea.ds of the JapaneseNavy to attack them with a view to their destruction indetail.    If we acted alone, therefore, we must sendnothing less xhan adequate forces.    But if we were totake action alone that would probably make it harder forafterwards .the American Government to co-operate/   From that pointof view, therefore, it would be wise-&quot;&quot; not to attemptanything by ourselves.    In any event he thought that thetquestion shoul^ stan^ over until a further telegram had.^een addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washingtonas to how far it would be vise for us to press the UnitedStates Government, and until a. reply had beenreceived!.The Secretary of State for the Colonies emphasised the importance of not giving the Japanese an excuse to attach Hong-ffong until adequate forces were available inthe Far East,
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That before framing any message to theUnited&quot; States Government containingsuggestions for dispositions by thetwo Governments to give weight torepresentations to the Japanese Gov-ernment against, the successive outragescommitted, by the Japanese forces, theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should consult His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington as to how far it would be prudent to go:(b) That the telegram to the ambassador should take into account the trend ofCabinet opinion.    Tt should convey noimpression that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwer^ at this moment  contemplating uni-leteral action. Assurrlng that the AmericanGovernment were not at present able to contemplate the possibility of despatch-ing a Battle Fleet to Far Eastern waterson the understanding that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment did. the same, the ambassador should ^e consulted as to whether he sawany objection to our suggesting some lessdrastic step by both Governments, such asmeasures to put the Fleet in a state of greater readiness (which, in our case,would, involve calling up Naval Reservists)and/or Naval Staff conversations: (See alsoPrime Minister s statement on p.ic marked &quot;A&quot;):( c) That further decisions as to our own action should, awe.it a. reply from His Majesty1 ambassador in Washington.
5,      The Cabinet had before them a Jointx     viz,,  the risk of &quot;incidents&quot; inan area controlled by Japanese.After discussion,  the Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Secretary of State for war should ask the General OfficerCommanding the British Forces at shangai to consider whether he could arrange to accommodate both the permanentbattalion and the second additionalbattalion now in the extra-Settlementarea within the Settlement, though heshould indicate that there wss. apossibility that eventually it might benecessary only to provide accommodation for one battalion:(b) That any further decision should be postponed until nearer the time whenthe international forces were removed   9from the perimenter.-IS -Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for War (C.P. 299 (37))on the question of the withdrawal of British troops from Shanghai, in which they adduced arguments leadingthem to make the following recommendations:-(i)    So long as foreign troops hold the perimeter,there should be no withdrawal of Britishtroops from Shanghai:(ii)   When withdrawal from the perimeter takes place, one battalion might be withdrawn,,the difficulty of accommodation being given as a reason:(iii)    Of the two remaining battalions, one shouldbe temporarily accommodated inside theSettlement, and the other in the existingpermanent quarters in the western extra-Settlement area-     This latter arrangement would involve the^risk mentioned inparagraph 6 abovef but this would have to be faced:    withdrawal of all British troops from the permanent quarters in the extra-Settlement area would give the impression of retreat in face of Japanese encroachment:(iv)   Any suggestion for further withdrawal wouldhave to be submitted for consideration.
(The Postmaster-General entered at this point).6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-301 (37))calling attention to the urgent problem of effecting animprovement in the quantity and quality of British news,and of world news from British sources, in the newspaperpress abroad, and suggesting that the Cabinet committee presided over by the Minister of Health, which dealt withforeign language broad casts, should be invited to examinethe matter in deta.il together with o^her relate^ questions raised in the Me-^orandu^*After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed:-(a)   That the Cabinet Committee presided overby the Minister of Health which dealt withForeign language broadcasting should beinvited to examine iri detail.the questions raised in CP.  301(37) together with otherrelated questions.(h)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should confer with the Chancellorof the Exchequer,  the Minister of health and the Postmaster-General as to theTerms of Reference.(The Postmaster-General withdrew. )
PROTECTION OP 7. &quot;he Cabinet had before them the following docu-VlmAL SER-vtcES. ments on the subject of the protection and maintenance(previous reference:Cabinet 29(37), Con-elusion 7,)pie. /8^*)/o.in war of public or essential services vital to the^effective prosecution of war and the life of the comma-nity:-A Note by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence &apos;C.P.-308 (37))  covering an interim Report by a Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence (P.V.S.-7)dealing with the Gas and electricity industries,    &quot;&quot;he Minister suggested that,pending examination in detail by theCommittee of Imperial Defence of othermatters in the Report, Cabinet considera-tion should be restricted to the questionof a start being ma.de with negotiations between the Government Departments concerned,and the two industries with a view to thepreparation of adequate programmes of air raid precautionary measures, towards thecost of which the Sub-Committee had. recom-mended certain contributions from theExchequer provided that the industries themselves contributed their proper share:A Memorandum by the Home Secretary (C.P.-309(.37)) stating that he was anxious to make astatement in the -Touse of Commons before the christmas Recess to the effect, that theGovernment accepted in principle the idea ofa grant to public utility undertakings.He thought it undesirable, however, to make an announcement in respect of two particular industries or to stale publicly a.ny figures which might serve as a basis for negotiationswith these undertakings.    He attached import-ance also to a clear distinction being drawn between the action vhich not only publicutility undertakings but also factory owners and householders ought to take for themselves,and  certain special measures which ought to he carried out hy the essential public utilityservices in the national interest in orderto ensure continuity of supply.   He therefore proposed, subject to the approval of theCabinet, to make an announcement before the recess on lines quoted at the end, of his Memo-rand um.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceexplained that this matter would have been dealt with bythe Committee of Imperial Defence but for the fact thatthe Home Secretary wished to make a statement inParliament on the subject before the recess..The Home Secretary said that in the course ofthe debates on the Air Raids Precautions Bill he hadfrequently been asked what was beini&apos; done as to publicUtility Companies.     Moreover, seme of these Companies-15-
were getting rather restive : for example, the MetropolitanWater Board, who had adopted their own scheme of Air RaidPrecautions, were holding it upe     The Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence suggested that theremust be a grant of some kind to Public Utility companies and they were convinced of the necessity for negotiationswith each of these services in turn.     He himself was anxious to begin these negotiations at once and the soonerthey were begun the better would be the chance of securingsome reasonable financial arrangements.     He had nowconsulted with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence on the form of hisdeclaration, the broad lines of which are set out in theconclusion below.After some further discussion the cabinet authorised the Home Secretary to make an announcement in Parliament on the following lines, subject to such drafting amendments as he might deem necessary:-&quot;The Government have been consideringthe position of certain essential publicutility services, the continued functioning of which is essential in wartime.The exceptional position of the industries concerned places upon them a special responsibility for doing their utmost toensure continuity of service in all circumstances, including those of war.These industries will have to incurconsiderable expenditure on the measures necessary to ensure continued functioningin wartime;    and the Government have accepted the principle of a contribution towards expenditure of this nature onprecautions additional to those falling on industry generally.The actual details of any such arrangementmust be worked out in close consultationwith the undertakings concerned.     These    $consultations will begin as early aspracticable in the New Year.&quot;
