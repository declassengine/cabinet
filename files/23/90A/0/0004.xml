THE late mr. RAMS/YMACDONALD(previous reference:Cabinet 41(3 7), Con-clusion 1.)1. The Prime Minister instructed the Secretaryto circulate to his colleagues a letter he hadreceived from the Secretary or State for DominionAffairs thanking him for the message he had sent onbehalf of the Cabinet, referred to in the conclusion mentioned in the margin.-i-
spain .he Non-ntervent ionomniitt ee.$previousiReferenee:ICabinet 411(3 7) , Con-1 elusion 3 .)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had some progress to report in the matters before the ^Ton-Intervention Committee.   The repr^sent a-tive of Soviet Russia had now withdrawn his refusal to adhere to the Committee&apos;s proposals.    This resulted.had had in Brussels with t-hein thecourse of which he himself had said that his ownunderstanding was that foreign volunteers in Spain would have to he withdrawnbefore belligerent rights were accorded, to general franco&apos;s Government.
3.  The Cabinet had before them a Report ( CP.-270(37)) by the Cabinet Committee on British Shipping inthe Par East, appointed, at the Meeting mentioned in the margin to consider, inter alia, the possible reinforce-ment of British Naval Forces in the Par East and, should it be thought necessary cr desirable to send such rein-forcements, to advise as to the kind of reinforcementwhich could be contemplated,   The Conclusions and Recom-mendations of the Committee were as follows .&apos;-&quot;(1) Reinforcement of British Naval Forces in theFar Eas t. .We recommend the Cabinet to approve theconclusions of the Chief of the Naval Staff jmentioned in paragraph 3 of this Report, viz.,(a)   that if a reinforcement of capital ships is to be sent, to the Far East, such a. reinforce-ment must be in sufficient strength to defeat37\l the full strength of the Japanese Navy, andthat, accordingly, a reinforcement of twocapital ships only should not be despatched to the Par East,, either on the assumption thatthe situation in the Mediterranean remains asat present, or in the event of a new situation arising in the Mediterranean with the discontin-continuance of piracy, as a result of the succesful issue o^ the Nyon Conference: and (b)  that should reinforcement o^ the British Nava.1 Forcesin the Far East be found necessary for thepurpose of assisting British nationals in China-,such reinforcements could better be effected by cruisers and/or destroyers or escort vesselsthan by capital ships.(2) Export of Munitions to China, through Hong Kong.   -Me cannot recommend the Cabinet to entertainthe suggestion that an embargo on the exportof arms and munitions from Hong Kong should be imposed, or a.n alternative suggestion that an approach should be made to the Chinese Govern-ment with a request that that Government shouldchoose between an embargo on the passage of armsthrough Hong i^ong or a. Japanese - blockade .   we accordingly recommen^ the Cabinet to adopt theoniy other alternative open to us, namely, thatwe should for- the present maintain the existing arrangements for the export of arms and munitions to China from Hong Kong.(3) The Assembly of Aeroplanes for China in Hong Kong.We recommend the Cabinet not to entertainthe suggestion of the Chinese Government thatthe Government of Hong, ^&quot;ong should allow theassembly, within the territory of the colony,of aircraft shipped thither in parts, and thatsuch aircraft, when assembled, should be flown
from Hong *&quot;ong to Chinese territory.    ;Verecommend the maintenance in this respectof&quot; the present arrangements under which anyaircraft reaching Hong ^ong in parts and.destined for China, are forwarded in unassem-bled condition by such means of transport as are available.Tf this recommendation is adopted by theCabinet, we suggest that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should be authorised,to communicate it to Mr Howe by telegram,the text of a draft of which is given inAppendix VT to this Report.&quot;The Cabinet also had. before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-280 (37))covering a. Memorandum by the Foreign Office (D.P.R.-221)on the legal aspects of the supply of arms from Govern-ment surplus stocks to the belligerents in the Sino-Japanese dispute.    This Memorandum had been taken note of by the Defence Requirements Committee (D.P.R. 43rd.Meeting, Minute 3). but no recommendation was formulatedas to the precise policy to be followed in the matter.The Admiralty had now been asked by Messrs Thornycroft&amp; Co. to sell to them twelve 18-inch Mark VII torpedoesfrom surplus Admiralty stocks for re-sale to the ChineseGovernment.    Such a. sale would be perfectly legal at anyrate in the absence of a state of war.   On the otherhand, hostilities amounting in practice to a. state of war were now in progress between China, and Japan, and theJapanese would almost  certainly become cognisant of thedetails of the s^le and would regard it as an unfriendlyact, notwithstanding that they ha.d not yet formallydeclared war.    mhe question then not being legal, but one of policy, the Secretary of State invited hiscolleagues to give a. general ruling as to whether or not. -sales from Government surplus stocks such as that atpresent in question would be permitted.
Referring to Conclusions (2) and (3) quoted above,the Prime Minister said that he had received informa-tion on the previous day to the effect that consider-abie trade was ftill being&apos; done with China throughHong-^ong, to which port some of the trade ofShanghai h*d been divertedo    This strengthened thegeneral purport of the Committee&apos;s Report that weshould avoi&quot; any step liable to result in action by japan calculated to interfere with the trade of hong-^ong.   He gathered also that nothing we could doin the way of export of munitions to China throughHong-T-&apos;ong was going to improve the situation for china.The Cabinet were informed that an applicationha.d now been received from a private firm for the exportation of a quarter of a million rounds ofammunition to Japan,.&quot;&quot;he President of the Board of Trade stated that up to the present, time he had postponed, dealing withthis and other applications of the same kind.    Inreply to a. Question in the House of Commons he had given the values of the amounts of war materia.1 forexport to japan.n ^or which licences had been given.The amounts had been very small, and no Supple-entaryQuestions had been asked at the time and no subsequentQuestion had been put. to him.    So long a.s the quanti-ties licensed amounted to a. mere trickle, political difficulties did not appear likely to arise.The Prime Minister pointed out that the question raised in C.Pe-280 (3 7) was one involving the sale of surplus Government wa.r material to China, and. Japan.The Cabinet agreed  (a.) mo approve the recommendations of theCabinet Committee in C.Po-270 (37) asset forth above:
That applications by private firmsfor licences for export of warmaterial to China and Japan shouldhe dealt with as hitherto, and thata policy of &quot;masterly inactivity&quot;should be maintained as long^aspossible in regard to thouvi Ja^*^-:^hat sales of surplus Government warmaterial to China, and Japan shouldnot be permitted while the presenthostilities lasted.
v, FAR EAST. 4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs madea statement as to progress at the Brussels Conference.Any tendencies in-the direction that the United Kingdomij!e Brusselsferenee.       were frustrating a lead, by the united. States had beenstifled and, as confirmed by telegrams from. His Majesty&apos;spreviousReference.       Ambassador at  Washington,  co-operation with America, at cabinet 41(?7) . Con-       the Conference had been good.   He mentioned the followingel us ion 4.)possible future courses for the Conference( i) To wind, up with a. tepid Resolution expressingregret th^t Japan would not. co-operate, ifpossible accompanied by the appointment ofa Sub-Committee to watch the situation,and then to adjourn.There would       great difficulties in securing the appointment of a Sub-committee as all the Powers with interests in Chinawanted to be represented thereon.^he disadvantage of this  course was thatChina would then ask that, the Council of theLeague of Nations should meet to consider what was to be done by the Powers to honourtheir obligations under the Covenant.    TheUnited States did not want the question to go back to Geneva, and desired, if possible, tokeep the Brussels Conference in existence,(ii) For&apos; the Brussels Conference to pass the tepidResolution indicated in (i) and then to nominatethe United States of America, and the Unitedkingdom to act as a Sub-Committee for purposesof conciliation.(iii) To express disapproval of the Japanese action and to refuse to recognise any territorialadvantages she might gain or to grant futurecredits .The disadvantage of this course would bethat it would much annoy the Japanese.    Never-theless he thought that such an announcementsubscribed to by the united States would notbe by any means futile.An element in the situation was that the Chinese had.hinted that if nothing res-alted from the Brussels Confer-ence they might throw themselves on mediation by Germanyand Italy.    The effect of that upon our own prestige wouldbe very serious.   He had. received a warning from theIndian Delegate at. the Brussels Conference as to theeffect of Japanese predominance in China       Burma and India.
The third of the above courses (disapproval of japanese action and renis0! to recognise the consequencesor to grant credits)  did not commend itself to the Cabineton a number of grounds.    Japan, it was pointed out, hadnot yet announced any intention of retaining any partof the occupied territory but had rather indicated acontrary intention, and she ha.d not asked for creditseither,   -s^. Putting a. proposal into the minds of the &apos;Japanese that they might otherwise never have contem-plated was^ calculated to court a rebuff from Japan,^he only justification for such a Resolution would be totLirtsK^   Ih-OTuZ-   &apos;/L^CjS W&amp;^il/^ CCU^fe^C h-t^ ifprevent Japan from acquiring Chinoso territory, but itwas not likely to have that effect.    Tf it failed as a threat, the Brussels Conference would be more than everhumiliated.Tn addition, the Cabinet were reminded that theJapanese were always inclined to associate the UnitedKingdom with proposals of that kind:    that, our military position in the Par East was very weak:    and that theproposal was calculated to aggravate the present irritation-tion in Japan, with consequences that  could not before seen.   Moreover, the result would be that theJapanese would reject mediation by ourselves or any ofthe Powers associated with the Brussels Conference, whichin any event was unpopular with them.,    Consequently theview was expressed that; in the unlikely event of theAmerican Delegation pressing this proposal, the United.Kingdom Delegates should endeavour to dissuade them by pointing out that threats were inadvisable, particularly if they were not likely to (be effective, and. thatomission to pass a Resolution containing the threatwould not prevent the Powers  concerned from applying the policy proposed later on if the Japanese should infact establish a. permanent occupation of conquered.Chinese territory, mr-
A fourth suggestion was discussed, namely, that  if nothing was achieved by the Conference the Governmentsof the United Kingdom and the united. States of Americashould spontaneously, and independently of the Confer-ence, offer to use their good offices in the directionof conciliation at any time that, the parties to *heconflict might welcome it.    This would forestall a reference to Germany and  Italy, and it would be difficult for the contending Powers to accept Germany and italy as  conciliators if they had rejected, an Anglo-Americanoffer.The Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and.Dominion Affairs, as a result of their experience at brussels, doubted, whether the United Sta.tes of america would be willing to do this except under authority fromthe Conference, and it was very doubtful if the Confer-ence could be induced to nomiiiate the united. kingdom andthe united States of America as the sole members of a.Committee.    That depended largely on the French attitude.The Prime Minister suggested that the &quot;nited kingdom delegates should take soundings as to whether theConference would be willing to nominate the UnitedKingdom and the United States of America, and that only if this was impracticable should we propose to substi-tute a. joint effort, by the two countries independently of the Conference.   An argument that, might appeal tothe French would be that a reference to Geneva would, be avoided by deputing the united. kingdom and the United.States to represent the Conference.The Cabinet realised that resort to German-Italianconciliation after a rejection of an Anglo-Americanoffer would be very serious.
The question was then raiser! as to whether the co-operation of Germany, with or without Italy, might besought at the outset,    This would be useful not only to avert a rebuff, but to secure a co-operative effort withGermany.mhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thathe and the Secretary o^ State for Dominion Affairs had considered this very carefully at Brussels.   The diffi-culty was that both France and Russia had much greaterinterests in the Far East than Germany had.    For that reason he thought that the suggestion was one that was difficult to work for., though it might be allowed todevelop naturally.mhe Prime Minister said that he would not ask theCabinet for a formal decision on the matters discussed,but he had. no doubt that the United Kingdom Delegateswould take the discussion into consideration in the linethey took at the Conference.The Cabinet then considered the representation at brussels when the Con^er^nce re-assembled on Monday,November 22nd.mhe Cabinet agreed  (a.) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  could not be spared, from london to proceed to Brussels at the reopening of the Conference on Monday next, November22nd:fb) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should proceed to Brussels on the evening of Friday, November 19th, and. should endeavour to secure that the conference should meet on Monday, November 22nd, andif necessary on Tuesday, November 23rd,merely to give formal approval to some arrangement which he would negotiate for bringing it, or at any rate its present stage, to an end:(c) That in view of the fact that the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs would, ftn?Pa.Fl ia.!?jsnt o.ry v    a ores-, probably have toreturn to London before the formal meetingsof the Conference referred to above, the
Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should, arrange for one of the parliamentary under-Secretaries of the Foreign Officeto proceed to Brussels with the Secretaryof State for Dominions Affairs to repre-sent him.&apos;(d) That no instructions should be laid down for the United Kingdom Delegates, but thatthey should ta.ke into consideration thevarious points ra.ised in the Cabinetdis cussion.-11-
PALESTINE. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGovernment       Secretary of State for the Colonies ( CP.-269 (37))Policy.suggesting that it was urgently necessary to impress(Previous upon the world at large certain implications of the reference:Cabinet 38 acceptance in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government of(37), Con- &quot; J     Jelusion 14.) part III of the Report of the Royal Commission onFX \*M-(yj)io.Palestine, relating to partition.    The procedure he advised was an open Despatch to the High Commissioner,which could be given early publicity in Palestine and simultaneously published in this  country in the form ofa. Command Paper.    In his Memorandum the Secretary ofState outlined the present attitude of Jews and Arabs,and attached a self-explanatory draft of a Despatchwhich embodied his own views and included the Terms ofReference of a. proposed further Commission to visitPalestine for the purpose of conducting inquiries onthe spot and of submitting to His Majesty&apos;s government proposals  confined to a. detailed scheme of partition.The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinet that on theprevious day he had learned that the Foreign Office hadbeen considering the Government&apos;s policy in the lightiof the present, situation and had made certain represent-ations to the Colonial Office.    Tn these circumstances he thought it was not appropriate that the cabinet should take a decision that day.A suggestion was made that, as the situation had changed very materially since the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had examined the Repuit of the Royal Commis-sion, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should meet them with a view to a re-examination of the militarya.spects of partition in the light of the present situa-tion as a whole.The Prime Minister thought it might be necessary to invite the views of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Commit.tee
a little later on, but he thought that, it would bebetter to wait until the Cabinet had received the considered views of the Foreign Office and Colonial,The Secretary of State for India warned the Cabinetthat Moslem opinion in India was now becoming ratheraggressive on the question of partition.    The situationdiffered from that existing vhen the Royal Commissionreported, when negotiations with both the Jews and theArabs with a view to the conclusion of Treaties had been contemplated.The Cabinet agreed  (a) mo postpone the question for a week.(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should circulate a memorandum.
6. The Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments on the subject of Closer Union between SouthernRhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and. Nyasaland.:-A Joint Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies(CP.-224 (37))   containing proposals towhich approval had. been given at theMeeting mentioned in the margin:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies .( CP.-276 (37)) statingthat, following the decision reached onOctober 13th, the Leaders of the twoOpposition Parties were prepared, to nominate members to participate in theproposed Royal Commission.    The Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs and himselfnow thought it woul^ be well to increasethe number of the Commission from 5 to 6,so that the Non-Parliamentary representa-tives might include, in addition to theChairman, one   with    administrative, andone with financial experience.    they proposed also, in addition to informing the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesiaof the suggested composition of the RoyalCommission before it was set up, tocommunicate the whole of the proposednames to the Opposition Party Leadersbefore an approach was made to any of thepersons  concerned, and that when thearrangements for the constitution of theCommission had sufficiently s.dva.nced, anannouncement should be made in parliament and simultaneously in Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, taking theform of the explanatory statement appended to CP.-224 (37), modified as suggested byMr Huggins, and with the following Terms ofReference as slightly amended, by Mr Attlee:-*To enquire an^ report whether any, and,if so, what form of closer co-operationor association between Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland isdesirable and. feasible, with due regardto the interests of all the inhabitants.irrespective of race, of the territories concerned, and to the special responsi-bility of His Majesty1s Government in theUnited Kingdom for the interests of then a t iv e inhab i t ant s.&quot;The President of the Board of Trade hoped thatthe Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and theColonies would not forget a promise that they would consult him on the selection of a suitable member ofthe Royal Commission for the consideration of tradeaspects of the question,.     He recalled the decision that
the question of the personnel of the Royal commission should he brought before the Cabinet (Cabinet 22 (37)Conclusion 4).The Secretary of State for the colonies said that on this point they had consulted theGovernor of the Bank of England who had suggested aname which he communicated to the CabinetaThe Cabinet agreed:(a) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, without waiting for a final decision as to the membership of the Royal Commission,to announce the fact that it was tobe constituted as well as the Termsof Reference as set forth above:(b) To invite the attention of the secretaries of State for DominionAffairs and the Colonies respectively to a suggestion that they should consult the Lord President of the Council, as leader of the House of Lords, as tothe selection of a Peer as Chairmanof the Royal Commission,
qIUM 7.     The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumBIDE.by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP 235deviouseference: (37); informing his colleagues that the Sub-Committeeabinet 15 (37)nclnsion 12.)       of the Committee of Imperial Defence, appointed in-FK.li ($y)f. pursuance of the Conclusion flH mentioned in the margin to consider and report as to the relativeadvantages of any schemes which might be submittedto them for the production of calcium carbide and-allied products in the United Kingdom, had recommended the scheme proposed by the British OxygenCompany for the er-e-c-^tion, of-43^-Xa*5jtoj?ies, one at port Talbot in South Wales., and the other at Corpachin the Highlands.      The Sub-Committee^ Report hadbeen considered by the Secretary of State forScotland, the President of the Board of Trade, theMinister of Labour and himself, and further discussions of the proposal with the Company had resulted in a basis of agreement, subject to G-overn-ment support on the promotion once more of theCaledonian Power Bill and to the grant of protectionif necessary.     The Minister and his colleaguesrecommended these proposals for acceptance by theCabinet, and suggested that as a statement inParliament on the matter was necessary, authority should be given to him to arrange for a Question and answer, the terms of which were set forth in theMemorandum.In the course of a discussion, thePrime Minister said that he did not agree thatthe establishment of a calcium carbide industry inthis country was essential to Defence, although it* might be advantageous.     Apart from the Scandinaviansource, supplies were available in other parts ofthe world, for example, in Canada, and could, ifnecessary, be brought by sea.     Even if, however,- 16 -
one factory was desirable from the point of view ofDefence, why was it necessary to have two?     Very strong objections were taken in Scotland to the factory atCorpach on the ground that it would ruin the amenities of some of the most attractive districts of theHighlandSo      He did not see why, if a factory were established in South Wales, the British Oxygen company should be allowed to go ahead with a factory inScotland as well.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceadmitted that the establishment of these factorieswas a relative rather than an absolute Defence interest.It was true that supplies could be brought from overseas,but it would involve a large ship every week from canada.     The British Oxygen Company (which he had explained in an earlier statement was the only onewhose offer was acceptable) was not prepared to go tothe expense of erecting the factory in South Walesunless allowed also to proceed with the factory atCorpach, where the electricity would be much cheaperand would be available not only for the manufacture ofcarbide but also of ferro-alloys.The Secretary of State for Scotland informed the Cabinet that there were divisions of opinion on thesubject in Scotland, but that the Scottish Members ofParliament had voted for the Second Reading of theprevious Bill, and that great political difficulties would arise if the Corpach scheme was dropped out.The President of the Board of Trade, while notopposing the scheme, warned the Cabinet of the risk thatthe British Oxygen Company, having set up its factory inSouth Wales, might fail to come to terms with the scandinavian interests for a quota agreement.      In that event, the Governments of Norway and Sweden would not -- 17 -
agree  ta    modification of the trade agreement soas to enable a new duty to he imposed and there wasthe risk that the Company might then come to theGovernment with a demand to help them out of theirdifficultieso      He hoped, therefore,  that theutmost care would he observed not to give the company the smallest encouragement that the Government would do so.In the course of the discussion, theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence mentioned that had received a suggestion from the Minister of labour for the amendment of his proposed Statement inParliament, which he preferred to the draftcontained in CP. 235 (37).The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence as setforth in CP. 235 (37) as well as thefollowing announcement to be made byQuestion and Answer in the House ofCommons *, -Question:    To ask the Minister forCo-ordination of Defencewhether the Government havearrived at a decision on theReport of the Committee onCalcium Carbide.Answer:       Yes, Sir.      The Committee,after full consideration ofa number of schemes submittedto them for the production ofcalcium carbide and alliedproducts in the United Kingdom,recommended the scheme submitted to them by theBritish Oxygen Company.    Thisscheme provides for theerection of two factories,one at Port Talbot in SouthWales, the other at Corpachin the West Highlands.
