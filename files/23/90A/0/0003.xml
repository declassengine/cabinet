He had. instructed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury to approach the Leaders of the Opposition Parties and the Speaker ofthe House of Commons on the question of the Parliamentarjprocedure to he adopted.Eefore the end of the Meeting he wa.s able to announce that the above authorities had agreed to the following procedure in the House of Commons:-PRAYERS cQUESTIONS.BALLJT,PRESENTATION OP BILLS.ADJOURNMENT TO BE MOVED ANDTRIBUTES PAID.The Cabinet accepted these arrangements and invited the Prime Minister on their behalf to send an appropriate message,expressing their deep regret and. sympathy,to Mr Malcolm MacDonald, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, for communication-tion to the members of his family.
SPAIN. 2.  Viscount Cranborne, acting for the Secretary of relations with    State for Foreign Affairs who was absent in Brussels,General Franco&apos;sGovernment. informed the Cabinet that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Hendaye had. not. been able to make contact with the(previous reference: representative o^ General Franco&apos;s Government on theCabinet 40(37), Con- previous day, but hoped on the morrow to agree the elusion 3 .)terms of a.

Air forces as to the avoidance of future attacks of a similar character,which did not  comply with our demands.    mhe ambassador had been instructed to state that the instructions issued were quite unacceptable.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsnov.- had so^e hope that the Russian Soviet attitude mightbe modified, and consequently the Earl of Plymouth had decided not to call a further meeting of the Non-intervention Committee just yet.-3-*

PARTS EXHIBITION-    5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theUnited Kingdom President of the Board of Trade (CP.-265 (37)) inform-part icipationin 1938. ing his  colleagues that although the original intention was that the Paris Exhibition should close on NovemberS^th, 1937, a decision had been reached by the Inter-national Exhibitions Bureau in Paris that under theterms of the Convention relating to InternationalExhibitions, signed at Pa.ris in 1928, the FrenchGovernment might, if they so desired, re-open the exhibition in 1938.    It was made clear, however, that every foreign country must be left free to decide for itself whether it should continue its participation.It was probable, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would receive at an early date an invitation from the French Government to re-open their Pavilionin May, 193 8, and the President asked for a decision as to the answer to be given if an invitation were received.    In his Memorandum he gave particulars ofweighty reasons against an acceptance by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of any such invitation.The President of the Board of Trade reported thatthe French invitation to re-open the British Pavilionin May, 1938, had now been received.Viscount Cranborne, while realising the force of-the objections to re-opening the British Pavilion,warned the Cabinet that the French Government were certain to put pressure on the British Government tomaintain their exhibit.    Other nations would, probablyagree to co-operate, and the French Government would,point, out that their former Ally and present friendwas the only nation that, refused ,   From a political* point of view, therefore, there were strong reasons-for accepting.
The objections raised in the Memorandum by thePresident of the Board, of Trade and its enclosure,however, were felt by the Cabinet to be very cogent,^he attitude of the French Cha-irtsan of the Bureau in trying to suppress *he legal opinion of M. de la.Fradelle, a distinguished French jurist, was strongly criticised.    The main reason, however,  for not eontinu-ing the British exhibit was the fact that an EmpireExhibition was to be held in Glasgow next May.The attention of ^he Cabinet was called also to astatement by the French Minister o^ Commerce in the bureau that  ttTlhe foreign countries who had participatedin 1937 would ^e entirely free to decide what theyshoul^ do in 1938&quot;, and to the reminder of these wordsgiven by the British representative at the meeting ofthe Council:    further, that he had  &quot;asked M. Barety,the French delegate, to repeat this assurance and to confirm that France would undertake not to use any pressure, either direct or indirect, either through diplomatic or any other channels, in order- to influenceparticipation&quot;.    this, it was felt, would be an answer to any attempt by the French Government to exert,pressure.-&quot;Tie Cabinet were informed that a first-classExhibition of British Modern Art was to ^e held inthe Louvre next Spring, though it would end in June.It was suggested that, this might be accepted by theFrench Government as some substitute for the retentiono^ the British PavilioncTn the absence of the Secretary 0f State forDominion Affairs the Minister^pf^Transportthat the Dominions would be
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the French invitation for thereopeninp of the British Pavilion atthe Pa.ris Exhibition next May shouldbe rejected:(b) That, in the reply some stress shouldbe laid, on the fact that a first-classExhibition of British Modern Art wasto be held in the Louvre next Spring.(Viscount Cmnborne withdrew at this point.)
CEYLON.6.   The Cabinet had before them the followingproposela for Memoranda by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesAmendment of constitution.     on Proposals for the Amendment of the Ceylon Consti-(previous reference:Cabinet 36(37), Con-clusion 10Jtut ion:-CP.-220 (37), to which consideration was given, but no decision taken, atthe Meeting referred to in the margin&apos;CP.-260 (37),. covering the draft of an -Order in Council, for submission to theFing in Council (furnished in accordancewith Cabinet 36 (37), Conclusion 10),with the object of amending Article 22of the Order in Council of 1931, with consequential amendments of certain other articles, in order to render effectivethe powers given to the Governor by that order on the recommendation of the special commission o^ 1928, and. to prevent, theexercise of those powers being hamperedor obstructed by the St*te Council.The terms of the draft Order had beenapproved by the Actine Governor of ceylon and. his legal advisers, and had been examined in the India Office in the lightof the experience gained of the working ofthe Government, of In^ia Act.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to submit, to the Fing inCouncil an Order in the form of thedraft printed as an Appendix to cp.-260 (37) .
AGRICULTURAL 7* The Cabinet had hefore them a Memorandum by the products.Minister of Agriculture ant? Fisheries f CP.-268 (37))Levy-Subs id iesfor, on the subject of Levy-Subsidies for agricultural products, in which it was stated that the National^previous reference: Farmers Union had taken the line that the proposalsCabinet 32(37), Con- contained in the tfhite Paper on Milk Policy (Cmd.cici33)elusion 10.)were a definite breach of pledges given to the dairyfarmers and of declarations made by Ministers in favourof the application of the levy-subsidy system to agricultural products in general and to dairy products in particular as an alternative to tariff protection,and were preparing to take political action in the constituencies,    ^hey had. aske^ theMinister to receive a Deputation at which they wished to put to him certain questions set out in the Memorandum, but before framinghis answer it was necessary for him to obtain the viewsof his  colleagues on the line to be adopted.    The issues involved had been considered, by an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee of Officials, and the Minister suggested thatin the first instance their Report (a copy of which was attached to his Memorandum) should be examined at onceby the Agricultural Policy Committee of the cabinet with a view to the matter being brought before theCabinet for a final decision, if   possible, on Wednesday,the 17th November.The Minister of Agriculture an^ Fisheries saidthat he had interviewed the President of the national farmers Union and had impressed on him that if the Uniontook up a hostile line the Government would defenditself.    Perhaps as a. result of this interview the/Manifesto had not been issued.    In addition, he. hadtmade a good many speeches in different parts of thecountry, which had perhaps helped to ease the situation.
At the same time protests were coming forward from thecountry branches of the National Farmers Union whichrather conveyed the impression of having been stimulated* from the central body,    &quot;he main issue was that of the levy-subsidy.    Without wanting to anticipate thedecision of the Cabinet Committee, he expressed his own opinion that the Government ought to state either thatthey adhered to their policy on the matter of a levy-subsidy or that they did not, and in either event theyshould give their rea.sons in full.The Ga^inet agreed  That the Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries ( CP.-268 (37))and the appended Report of an inter--Departmental Committee o^ officials should be examined a.t onee by theAgricultural Policy Committee of theCabinet, who should be asked to reportin time for a final decision to be givenby the Cabinet on Wednesday, the 17thNdvejeb er.s
(The Secretary for Mines entered at this point.)THE COAL BILL.     8.    The Cabinet had before them the following documentsCon el us ionsof CabinetCommittee onOrganisationof the CoalfiningIndustry.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(37), Con-elusion 7 ,)&quot; 3/        i).relating to the Coal Bill:-A Note by the President of the Board ofTrade (C.Po-263 (37))   circulating aMemorandum by the Secretary for Minesto which was attached a draft Bill,revised, on the lines indicated, in the sixth Report of the Committee on theOrganisation of the Coal Mining Industry(c&quot;.P.-240 (37))  and approved by theCabinet at the Meeting mentioned in the margin, together with a draft of an explanatory White Paper.    In his Memo-randum the Secretary for Mines gave particulars of the respects in whichthe Bill had been revised and. called attention to certain points arisingout of recent discussions between the mines Department and the interests concerned:The conclusions and. recommendations ofthe Cabinet Committee on the Organisationof the Coal Mining Indus try (G *M , I. (35)l^th Conclusions), who, with the PrimeMinister&apos;s  concurrence, had examined thedraft Bill in place of the usual examina-tion by the Committee of Home Affairs,and had also had. before them CoP*-263 (37).The Committee agreed to recommend theCabinet as follows-&apos;-(1)(2)To approve their conclusions andrecommendations regarding outstand-ing points on the draft Bill andthe draft White Paper, as summarised in CoMolo (35)  15th Conclusions:Subject to (l)  above anr&quot; to any amendments of a drafting, techincal or minor character which might bethought necessary or desirable, toauthorise the immediate introduction in the House of Commons of the CoalBill, 1937, in the form of the draft attached to CcP.-263 (37).The President of the Board of Trade suggestedthat the Cabinet should hear from the Secretary for mines the objections of the owners to the governments proposals which were of a fundamental character.The Secretary for Mines said he had discussed the matter several times with the royalty owners and had made known the GovernEtent&apos;s position.     The royalty owners&apos; objection was one of principle against the
fact of their being forced to accept instalments ofcompensation in advance of the date on which the schemecame into force.      Their fear was that in the interval between the advance payments and the final date forvesting,    money rates might have risen.      Theydid not see why they should have to run this risk.   - Theyadmitted that the owners of royalties on some particularestates would be glad to receive these earlier payments on a voluntary basis, especially, for example, those that had mortgages on their royalties,,     They thoughtalso that if the advance payments were put on a voluntary basis, the financial effects would be much the same asunder the Governments proposals.      They agreed that theinterest rates proposed by the Government were fair, butthey objected in principle to the compulsory advancepayments of compensation and might be expected to opposethese as vigorously as possible.      In this connection,he reminded the Cabinet that,in any event, payment  couldnot   be   made until after valuation day, namely January 1st1939, nor for some time after that as, in the interval,various administrative processes would be necessary, forexample, investigation of title, issue of cer*certificates,etc.     He did not dissent from an estimate by a memberof the Cabinet that as much as two years might elapse before any advance payments of compensation could bemade in any event0The President of the Board of Trade did not anticipate that the royalty owners would fight the scheme as a whole, but he was certain that they would resiststrongly on this pointo     He accepted the view of theChancellor of the Exchequer that the right to pay compensation by instalments was essential from the
financial point of view.     He thought it might he possibleto press the measure through the House of Commons on theselines, hut he was doubtful as to the House of Lords.There the case would be fought on a much wider issue thanthat of the Coal Bill.     It would be urged that in a contract for sale, it was unprecedented for the buyerto be put in a position of being able to force payment on the vendor before the date fixed for the conclusionof the transaction in an arbitrary manner and by arbitraryamounts.      Opposition on those lines would rally property owners of all kinds in the House of Lords.     An awkwardpolitical situation would arise if the Government and the . -House of Commons had insisted that this provision wasfundamental from the point of view of finance, and theHouse of Lords had thrown it out on wider grounds ofprinciple.The Lord President of the Council suggested thatif it was the case that no payments could be made for twoyears and that a large part of the money raised for earlierpayments might be absorbed voluntarily by particularroyalty owners, the political difficulties might perhaps be greater than the advantages to be derived.      In orderto avoid an awkward political situation, he suggestedthat the royalty owners, who had already been told thatthese advance payments were essential, might be askedwhether they would be prepared to enter into a &quot;gentleman1sagreement&quot; to press as many of their members as possibleto accept advance payments on a voluntary basis.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, responding toa request by the Secretary of State for India for thereasons why advance payments for compensation were considered necessary, made a statement to the Cabinet.He explained that he did not belittle the anxieties ofhis colleagues and was most anxious to find some means
of accommodation.      He recalled that it was not theTreasury but the Commission which would have to administer the Actc      In doing so, it would have to raise first andlast  70,000,000.     The raising of this sum side by side with the large amounts to be raised for Defence would necessitate great care on the part of the Commission (inconsultation with the Treasury) to pick and choose the besttimes for the instalments.      The loan, of course, would bea long-term one carrying interest of perhaps as much as3^- to 4 per cent, and it must be accepted as probable thatit could only be raised at carefully chosen intervals.The suggestion made by the royalty owners was that, althoughthe Commission had to raise the money in this way, theywere not to be able to use the instalments, when raised, fortheir intended purpose.     What then were they to do with themoney?     If they lent it on a short-term basis,  they would onlybe receiving about 1 per cent, while paying perhaps 3^ to4 per cent.:    a transaction that could not be justified.      Thatwas the fundamental reason why the proposal for leaving theroyalty owners in possession until 1942 had never beenaccepted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Cabinetexcept on condition of provision being made for advance payments on account of compensation,,     He admitted that the situation was anomalous, but the whole scheme, with its postponement to1942, was itself anomalous.     He recalled that the WilfridGreene Tribunal - brought into existence at the instance ofthe owners - had been given the agreed figure of  4,430,000,namely, the average net annual income derived from the property and had only had to fix   the multiplier, i,e. the number ofyears purchasee     Naturally, it had taken into account the thenprevailing rates of interest.     If it had been told that vestingwas to be postponed until 1942, it would not have taken
those rates of interest and would have had to fix themultiplier on some other basis.      The Government ought tobring&apos; home to the royalty owners that they were now receivingmore generous treatment than under the Wilfrid Greene award,since they were receiving 4 years       addition to the period during which they would draw the royalties, and these were likely to be very good years.      The royalty owners appearedto think that the Government were putting on their shouldersthe risk of a change in the value of money.      That was notat all the case.      The Government&apos;s proposals were merely the conditions which the Government had had to insist onin order that the Commission might fulfil its task.     his suggestions were -(l)    That no payment on account should be made before a certain date to be fixed:(2)    That the Commission, in deciding to make payments on account, should so far as it feltjustified make those payments to those whoexpressed preference for them.There was really nothing in the point made by theroyalty owners that this was done because there was likelyto be a change in the value of money.     There might be achange upwards or downwards0      Conditions of this kind,however, had to be taken into account in all cases of transactions, for example, sales of land or monies paid into Court.      It was part of the risk that complicatedany transactions of this kind.      He hoped, therefore, thatthe Cabinet would treat this as an important matter ofGovernment policy.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that theBill had to be introduced the same afternoon.     He read therecommendation at the head of page 3 of the CabinetCommittee&apos;s Minutes (CM.I.  (35) 15th Meeting)o
bill the President of the Board of Trade said that thepoint at issue appeared rather obscurely in the Bill andwould not be taken much notice of by the general public.Moreover, it would not be difficult to amend it later.In 10 days&apos; time, however, when the Bill was debated andit became clear that this was an essential part of theBill, the whole controversy would arise.     There was time,therefore, for the proposal of the Cabinet Committee thatthe Secretary for Mines, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, should consider whether someamendment to paragraph 19 of the Third Schedule could be devised and put forward at a later stage so as to avoidcriticism on the ground of the alleged arbitrary characterof the proposal.The Lord President of the Council supported this plan*     The opposition to the Bill would be formidable andin the House of Lords would be based on a fundamentalobjection that the principle of the Bill could be appliedto other forms of property.     He thought, therefore, theright course was to introduce the Bill as it stood and,in the interval of 10 days before the Debate began, to explore the possibility of a &quot;gentleman^ agreement&quot; onthe lines he had suggested.The Lord Chancellor supported the Lord Presidentof the Council and urged that a split in the House ofLords on this question would be disastrous,,The Cabinet agreed?(a)   To authorise the President of the Boardof Trade the same afternoon to introduce in the House of Commons the Coal Bill,1937, in the form attached to cp. 263 (37), subject to the conclusions and recommendations of the CabinetCommittee as set forth in CM.I.  (35) 15thMeeting, and to any drafting.amendments of a technical or other minor character which might be found necessary or desirable:
(b) To approve the recommendations ofthe Cabinet Committee as set forth in the conclusions of the 15th MeetingC.M.I0  (35), including the white paper and the following recommendation:&quot;To maintain their previous decision regarding payments inadvance on account ofcompensation (Clause 7 (9) and paragraph 19 of the third schedule) on the understandingthat the Secretary for mines in consultation with theChancellor of the exchequer would consider whether someamendment to paragraph 19 of theThird Schedule could be devisedand put forward at a later stageso as to avoid criticism on theground of the alleged arbitrarycharacter of the presentproposalo&quot;(c) That the consultation referred to inthe above recommendation by theCabinet Committee should take place at once with a view to possiblefurther negotiations with theroyalty owners.      The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer if, in consultationwith the President of the Board ofTrade und the Secretary for Mines, heshould deem it desirable should himself   see the representatives ofthe royalty owners or, alternatively,take other steps in order to secure a &quot;gentleman1s agreement&quot; withthe owners based on the following principles 2-(i)    That the Commission should make no payment on account before acertain fixed date:(ii)    That, in deciding to make payments on account, theCommission so far as it feltjustified should make themto those who expressed a preference for receiving them:(iii)    Thiit the royalty owners should undertake to do their utmost to secure as large a number aspossible of owners willing&apos;bo accept advance payments..(The Secretary for Mines withdrew at this point.)
