agricultural policy.1.The Cabinet continued their discussionof the outstanding points in regard toLevy-subsidies for Agricul-tural Products.Agricultural Policy which had begun at theMeeting earlier in the day, mentioned in the margin.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(PreviousReferenceCabinetbriefly summarised the events which had led upto the issue in July, 1937 of the Milk Policymite Paper (Cmd. 5533).      This White Paper had43 (37)Conclusion 10).met with considerable criticism from the agricul-tural interests and after consultation with thePrime Minister it had been decided to refer thewhole question of Levy-Subsidies for agricultural products to an Inter-Departmental Committee, theReport of which (CP,  268 (37)) had been adoptedby the Agricultural Policy Committee of the Cabinet(CP. 275 (37)).      He had accepted the conclusionof the Committee (which had subsequently beenapproved by the Cabinet) that a Levy-Subsidypolicy should be definitely abandoned and that anannouncement to this effect should be made.policy of quantitative regulation of imports of milk products should be adopted, that policy hadalready received the approval of the Cabinet and powers to impose such quantitative regulation wereembodied in the Agricultural Marketing Act,  1933.The only question was should the power in its new form to impose quantitative regulation in the caseof imports of milk products be inserted in the milk Bill, or should we continue to rely on theThe point now at issue was not whether aMarketing Act powers.
If the latter solution was adopted theposition would he defective in various directions,e. g. the powers would he definitely linked with the milk Board and if, for any reason, that Board was todisappear the powers would vanish with it.     while he had no immediate intention of taking any drastic action in regard to the Board he was by no meanssatisfied that the Board provided the most efficient and satisfactory form of machinery for the work to bedone.      The best solution might be to substitute for it some other organisation under the Milk commission which it was now proposed to set up.      So long as theonly powers to impose quantitative regulation on imports of milk products were those in the MarketingAct there would be some danger of the farmers wishing to keep the Milk Board in being in order to preservequantitative regulation.      Moreover, it was very desirable that the powers in the Milk Bill should bebased on the considerations and interpretations whichhad now been agreed by the Departments concerned, andin particular that they should be used to preventinstability in the home market being caused byexcessive imports.As regards the House of Commons the Governmentwould be in a much stronger position in asking for theinclusion of existing powers in a somewhat differentform in the Milk Bill than they had been when they had had to ask for entirely new powers in the LivestockIndustry Bill.The agricultural interests would be highlysuspicious and critical of a suggestion that relianceshould be placed solely on the Marketing Act powers in view of the fact that no use had been made of
those powers since 1935 when we &quot;became free from theOttav/a restriction on our right to impose quantitative regulation on imports of dairy products.He did not favour a suggested compromise thatin the announcement the position should he left open.If the farmers got the impression that quantitative regulation would he imposed and this was not, in fact,done there would &quot;be accusations of &quot;breach of faith.The Prime Minister asked whether the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries wished to announce thatthe powers to impose quantitative regulation would heinserted m the Milk Bill.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat this was so.    He wished to he able to reply to enquiries by saying that the Government reserved theright to impose quantitative regulation of the productsconcerned if imports were such as to lead to instabilityin the market for those products in the United Kingdom.The President of the Board of Trade said thatall he asked was that he might have adequate opportun-ity before any announcement was made of consideringall the implications of the proposal hecause it mightwell run us into serious trouble over our Trade Agree-ments.    He did not think that anything should be said which would prejudice consideration of the problem.Could not the Minister of Agriculture say something tothe effect &apos;that if imports were such as to lead toinstability in the home market the Government wouldtake steps to rectify the position&apos; without specificallymentioning the insertion of powers in the Milk Bill.
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidhis objection to this was that quantitative regulationwas the last surviving remnant of what we had obtained at Ottawa.    The farmers would press for a clear definition-ition of the Governments position and on prompt action being taken in an emergency.    They did not want action-delayed until overseas dumping had ruined the homernarketoIn the course of discussion, the Prime minister pointed out that it might cause difficulties hereafterif an announcement was made that the powers would beinserted in the Milk Bill without the whole positionhaving first been carefully examined.    For example, ifthe powers were inserted in the Bill and it was thenfound that we could not use them because of our trade agreement with Denmark,  the Government might be accused of breach of faithoThe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries drew attention to the proposals in paragraph 86 (b) of theInter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report (cp 268 (37))for overcoming difficulties of this kind.The President of the Board of Trade thought thatit would be difficult to defend the taking of new vovrersin the Milk Billy when the powers already existed in theAgricultural Marketing Acto    It would have to be argued that the Government wished the powers to remain in theevent of the disappearance of the Milk Board.    Such an argument would be damaging to the Board.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries repeated that he wanted the powers inserted in the Milk Bill soas to enable quantitative regulation to be imposed ifimports were such as to lead to instability in the market for the products in question in the United Kingdom^
After some further discj.ssi.on,  the Prime minister suggested that the reference to the matter in the announcement should take the form &quot;under existing powers or underamended powers if necessary&quot;0T^e President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries agreed to accept thissuggestion.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries then read to the Cabinet the following conclusions covering thevarious outstanding points raised in the course of thediscussion on the subject:-(i) That the decision of the Cabinet on the17th November 1937 (Cabinet 42 (37)Conclusion 8) to abandon the principleof levy-subsidies in respect of &apos;meat and livestock, bacon, milk and otherdairy products&apos; should be extended toinclude eggs and poultry.(ii) That t^e reservation to impose quantitative regulation upon Dominion imports of the products (viz:- eggs, poultry, butter,cheese and other milk products) at presentcovered by Schedule A of the ottawa agreements and Schedule I of the CanadianAgreement, 1936, should be in the followingform: -&quot;the right to impose quantitative regulation of the products concernedif imports were such as to lead toinstability in the market for those products in the United Kingdom&quot;.(iii) That if and when the Dominion Governmentsconcerned make enquiries as to the meaning of this reservation, t^ey can be assuredconfidentially to the following effect:-&quot;It is not intended to use the rightof quantitative regulation of imports to maintain a high level of prices inthis market.      The right would only beused to relieve a situation in whichthe volume of imports coming on to themarket threatened the stability of theindustries concerned in the UnitedKingdom.&quot;If necessary, it might also be explained tothem privately and confidentially that inusing the term &quot;industries concerned&quot; it isintended to treat the milk industry as one,apart from the industries engaged in the
manufacture of processed milks, and to regard as separate units the industriesengaged in the production of eggs and table poultry respectively.(iv) That the power to impose quantitative regulation of imports of milk products in accordance with the formula inconclusion (ii) above should be retainedunder existing powers or amended powersif that should be found necessary.(v) Tbat the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be authorised to explainpublicly the circumstances in whichquantitative regulation would be appliedon the lines of the interpretation inconclusion (iii),  during the debates onthe Milk Bill, or earlier if &quot;he considersit expedient,(vi) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be authorised to announce the Government&apos;s decision in regard tolevy subsidies, to the amplifications ofthe Governments policy for milk as setout in the White Paper of July last, andto the reservation of the right to imposequantitative regulation of imports of milk and poultry products, to reputationsrepresenting the National Farmers1 union and the Milk Marketing Board;    and thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland shouldbe authorised to make similar announcementsto the corresponding Scottish organisations.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) To approve the conclusions suggested tothem by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries as set out above.(2) That as the proposals approved by theCabinet on the 17th November 1937(Cabinet 42 (37) Conclusion 8) in regardto price insurance in respect of milkused for manufacture involved certaindepartures from the proposals on thissubject which had been announced in the milk Policy White Paper (Cmd.  5533) thenew proposals should be communicated toParliament before they are actuallyannounced to the respective deputations,and that the most convenient coursewould be for the Ministers concerned toarrange for Answers to be given to private notice Questions simultaneouslyvin bothHouses of Parliament and for the deputa-tions to be received by the MinisteTSimmediately after Questions  on the afternoon of the day on which the Answerswere given.
