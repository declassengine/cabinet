The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had nothing fresh to report with regard to Spain.previous reference:       The Non-intervention Committee was awaiting the replyCabinet 43(Zl), Con-       of the Spanish Government to its suggestions.

PRE FAR EAST. 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsjapan and reported that the situation from the point of view ofChina.the Shanghai Customs was a little easier,    ^he changeI(previous in the Japanese attitude ha.d coincide^ with, thoughReference:Cabinet 43 he would not say that it was necessarily due to,(37), Con-clusion * ,) representations made by the British, United. States and&apos;     French Governments at ^okyo.   He warned the Cabinet,however, that the Ja.pa.nese naval and. military authori-ties were likely to determine the policy of Japan.The affair of the Customs was only in the nature of a preliminary skirmish, and the real tussle would come when the question of control of the InternationalSettlement area was raised.   When that happened, theJapanese would be likely to demand either a newConcession for themselves or a large measure of controlover the International Settlement.The Chancellor o^ the Exchequer, after recallingthat only a few years ago the Chinese had attributed,many of their difficulties to the existence of theInternational Settlement, asked whether it was notprobable that the Japanese, who liked to representthemselves as  champions of the Fa.r East, would espousethe ca.use of the Chinese and insist that the Inter-national Settlement should he abolished.   Having thusgot rid of Yestern nations, was it not likely thatseek tothey would themselvesytake their pl^ce?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought this was not an improbable development.
FAR EAST.Supply of ArmsJapan and china.previous reference:Cabinet 43(37). Con-clusion 1.)3.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether there had been any formal decision by the Cabinet as tothe exportation of munitions from Hong-Kong.    Was therenot a. risk, he asked, that in present  circumst.ances we might, by persisting in our present practice,  involveoi^rs elves in err eat difficulties with Japan?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that the whole subject had been explored by a CabinetCommittee, under the Chairmanship of the Home Secretary.whose Report had been considered and approved by theCabinet as recently as the 17th November, when it hadbeen decided, inter alia, that we should for thepresent maintain the existing arrangements for theexport o^ arms and munitions to China fro^- Hong-T&apos;ong,and that a.aircraft reaching Hong-T-rong in parts anddestine^ for China, should continue to be forwarded inuna.ssem.bled  condition by such means of transport as are available    (Cabinet 42 (37), Conclusion 3).alsoThe Cabinet were reminded/of the decision at theMeeting referred to in the margin, that there shouldbe no interference with a. consignment of machine-gunsdestined for Japan,The Prime Minister pointed out that the bombing ofthe railway must have the effect, of stopping thetransport of much of the war material.   We were boundto be faced with trouble in connection with Hong-^ong,hut he thought it would be a. mistake to change thepolicy at -^he present moment as it woul^ give theimpression that we were taking a side in the struggle.This was agreed to.
&quot;EGYPT.(previous reference:Cabinet 43f&apos;37), Con-clusion 7.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inreply to the Lord President of the Council, said thata difficult situation had arisen between Nahas Pashaand ving Farouk in &quot;Egypt, and Sir T/iles Lamps on had.asked for his guidance.   He had replied suggesting a middle line between the two courses of backing, upNahas Pasha and leaving him to fight it out with theFing of &quot;Egypt,    ^he middle course proposed, was that.Sir Miles Lampson should induce Nahas Pasha to broadenthe basis of his Government, but at the same time heshould see the T&apos;ing and urge him in the most vigorouslanguage to co-operate with the present Government on abroadened basis and to abandon his policy of obstruc-tion and pinpricks.   He added that, the moment was thewor^t possible one for an appeal by Nahas to thecountry, as he might then be overthrown and. there wasthe possibility of his ^einf- replace^ by an Italo-phile administration, with the T&quot;ing also opposed tothe ^ritish connection.    In sending this telegram,however, the Secretary of State had. left Sir miles lampson, in whom he had great  confidence, some discre-tion.The Lord President of the Council agreed with theSecretary of State for Air that the advice to Sir miles lampson was wise.   He hoped, however, that if therewas a prospect of T&apos;ing Farouk being in league with italy we should not hesitate to take more drastica ct ion.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,that Sir Miles Lampson had already been authorised togive a hint that our support, to the T&quot;ing of Egyptdepended upon the adoption by His Majesty of a properconstitutional attitude0
(jTSRMANY, 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign / ff airs&quot;he Anglo- reported that the Anslo-Fr^nch conversations of the twoFrenchConverse.- previous days had begun with a statement by the lordtions .^ President of the Council on his visit to Germany, which[previous       had been as full an^ as frank as that giv-n to the reference:: cabinet 43    Cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin.    Thej (57) ,Con-I elusion 3.) statement had obviously made a. favourable impression.The French had. noted that Herr Hitler had made the point that there was no connection between the colonial ques-tion and that of Central Europe and the other questions raised,    &quot;&quot;he Lord President had explained that he made clear that this was not his attitude.C^WRAL ErTROPE.        On the subject of Central Europe the French&apos;PrPvious       Ministers had sal1&quot; that there were two possible policies:Re -f&quot;erence*Cabinet 63    ^ 1)  to disinterest ourselves, and (S)  to interest our-(.R6) . Con-elusion 3.) selves in a spirit of conciliation.    On the question ofCZ^CHO- the Sudeten-Deuts ch in Czecho-Slovakia, the BritishSTiOVATTIA .Ministers had urged the importance o^ meeting legitimate(previous reference:    grievances, and had asked M. Delbos, on the occasion ofCabinet *(37), Con-   his  coming visit, to try and find out what concessionselusion 3 .)Dr. Benes was willing to make, as this would be mostF.useful in our approaches to Berlin,    &quot;&quot;he French ministers had agreed, but ha^ pointed out that the Germans prefer-red bilateral negotiations with Czecho-Slovakia and. haddoubted what sort of reception they would give to ourfriendly and pacific effortsaOn the subject o^ Austria it had. been agreed thatprevious       the situation was rather different.    mhe last declara-Reference :Cabinet 5l tion had been that of Stresa. when Great Britain, Fre.nce(3S), Con-clusion 7.)  and. Italy had agreed in the maintenance o^ the integrityanri independence o^ Austria, as a. necessary element, in^ European pe*ee.    mhe French Ministers had. pointed outthat the Italian interest in Austria, had somewhatweakened, but did not think that they had entirely
disinterested themselves in that  country.    They agreedthat the Austrian Government had shown great courage,and their information corresponded to ours, that Dr.Schuschnigg&apos;s position had improved.    They had agreedalso that Austria must take a place in the negotiationswith Germany and that it mighrt he useful to obtain a repetition of the German declaration of last July.Disarmament was  considered by the French ministers to be of capital importance in a settlement,    ^he BritishWinisters had expressed the viev that qualitativedisarmament held, out better prospects than quantitative,and the French Ministers had undertaken to look intothis.    The French Ministers had insisted that some measure of disarmament was essential to any arrangement.On the subject of the League of Nations and its constitution an^ powers, the Lord President had pointedout that the Germans  could not face rejoining so long asthe nominal powers of coercion were maintained.    Onthis point the French Ministers had not been so rigidas had been anticipated.    mhey wanted, however, to keepArticle 15 for regional agreements even if it was notretained for general use.    mhey ha^ not rejected, asuggestion +0 consider a solution proposed, by the scandinavian Governments in favour of leaving to theLeague the faculty to apply sanctions.   At the outset,however, the French Ministers thought it would bebetter not to raise these particular issues.    Theyrecalled that Herr Hitler himself had, asked why other nations were so anxious to have Germany in the Leaguewhen the United States of America, was not a member, and.had suggested that, a League without Germany was a possi-bility.
On the subject of colonies the Prime Minister Jaad.made clear our view that if Prance and Great BritainpreviousReference- discussed the question,  even among themselves, it wasCabinet 43(37j, Con- only as part of a general settlement and not a. questionjjl&amp;ion 3. ) aq^ea-ctstanding by itself.    mhe French did- not dieacut fiomthis view.    The Prime Minister had given a. frank accountof our own difficulties over Tanganyika and had. made clear that the French would not be asked, to make asacrifice if Great Britain was not prepared to do some-thing correspond ins .    The Prime Minister&apos;s statement had.been received with warm, thanks by m. Chant emps, who had made clear that the French Government wa.s far in advanceof public opinion in France on this matter.    TheGovernment would, as part of a. general settlement, beprepared to make some sacrifice, but public opinion hadnot yet reached, that point.   M. Chautemps had made clearthat the Prime Minister&apos;s statement would be a greathelp to him.   He had given a formidable catalogue of thedifficulties that beset this question, but the points ofview o^ the two Governments had proved to be very similar.Both Governments had agreed that much more explorationwas required both as to what each Government  couldcontribute and. as to what was required, in the approach to Germany.    There had. also  been agreement as to thedelicacy of any possible approach to Belgium and portugal, the latter of whom had. not received anycolonial territory under the Treaty of Versailles,^jOCARNO TREATIES.        There had also been some discussion about theprevious Locarno Treaties, and. it had. been agreed that, someInference:Cabinet 38        agreement in Western Europe was essential to a general(37), oon-conclusion 3) .       settlement.[PHE par EAST So far as the Far East was concerned, the french ministers had sha.red. our own views but had displayeda. good deal of irritation at the attitude of the UnitedStates of America.

The present. French Government didnot appear to he much under the influence of ideologicalicomplexes.ITALY. In discussing Italy the French Ministers had shownoposed more signs of irritation than on any other subject.    Thisgotia-ons with. was largely due to a Press  campaign in Italy about arevious speech alleged to have been made hy the French minister reference:Cabinet 43 of Marine, which was denied altogether by the latter.(37), Con-clusion 7.)       The British Ministers had argued, in favour of someF.R. l^fej) 2-.^^gj^approach to Italy, and. it had. been agreed, that theItalian Government should be informed, that we were willing to take up the proposed conversations and. thatthe French Government had been consulted and had agreedto this  course.    The French Ministers had insisted,however, that a stop must be put to Press polemics^The French Ministers had not been much disturbed aboutthe Italian reinforcements to Libya.    They themselveshad sent some reinforcements to Tunis, not so muchbecause they were apprehensive of the fact as to reassurepublic opinion.Summing up his impressions,t the Secretary of state said. thai, the talks had. been very useful, particularly in achieving the following four points:-(l) They had set at rest the rumours of adivergence of view between the Britishand French Governments in the matter ofpolicy towards Germany and on the colonialquestion:(2) They had convinced him that. France was asanxious as we were to induce the germans to come to terms:(3) There had. been no sign that the french ministers desired, to be lined up with aLeft. blo.Q in Europe:    neither did they appear to be in any way under Russianinfluence:    in fact they had shown some
misgivings as to the future of Russianforeign policy after the elections nowin progress . mhey had also shown some anxiety as to Polish foreign policy:(4) The conversations had enabled us to--take an in^ispensahle first step in the direc-tion of some dealings with Ger-any overcolonies, and the views of the twoGovernments ha^ proved to be identical 0He warned the Cabinet, however, that, progress was bound to be slow.    It was important to avoid, sensationand public discussion, and in his view the result mightwell depend upon our re-armament *The Prime Minister supplemented the statement bythe Foreign Secretary.BNTRAL EUROPE. Referring to Central Europe, he said the view ofthe French Ministers had. been that Germany was aiming atthe absorption of Austria and part of Czecho-Slovakia.At one time it had looked as though they were going topress the British Ministers  to adopt  some more forthcom-ing attitude in Central Europe.    No encouragement hadbeen given them, however, and finally they had agreed.that appropriate concessions might be made by Czecho-Slova.kia and that an attempt, shoul^ be made to reach a.genera.1 settlement with Germany.    They had agreed thatthere was no likelihood of immediate German intervention in Czechn-Slovakia or Austria, but that the Germansexpected to get what  they wanted, in due course.    If we also desired to postpone the issue there was the possi-bility that, it would settle itself and. never arise.As to Signor Mussolini and Austria, the French ministers had a.greed. that better relations with Signor Mussolinimight have the effect of reviving his interest, un austria, in which case his  co-operation might be valuable,The most difficult section of the negotiations had.been that relating to colonies, which was harder for usIQL0MIES.t
GERMANY.Form ofProposedNegotiations *(previous reference:Oabinet 43Oon-clusion 3 .)than for the French.   With France it was only a questionof whether they could  cede Togoland and. the Cameroons .In our case exchanges of territory to meet the strategic-al difficulties, of which the Cabinet were aware, had tobe taken into account, and. these involved, serious problems.   He-proposed that the question should bereferred, in the first instance to the Cabinet Committeeon Foreign Affairs, which would report in due course tothe Cabinet.So far as Germany was  concerned, the only action he contemplated was to warn the Government that some time would be necessary for the study of these questions and.that they must not be disappointed if there was some delay,He also proposed that conversations should betaken up with Signor Mussolini.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had arranged to see the German Ambassador thes a me afternoon.mhe Prime Minister, answering a. point raised by theLord Chancellor, said, that one of the difficulties of the negotiation was to obtain a fair makeweight for colonialconcessions, since Germany only ha.d assurances to offer.So far the minds of those who had considered, the matter had. vworked in two directions:    first, German association with the League, and, second, disarmament.   mhe latter was the more important in this  connection, as if some measure of disarmament  coul^ be carried out it would bein the nature of a. guarantee.Replying as to the form which the negotiations would, take, the Prime Minister sai^ that our idea had -been to take the initiative ourselves but to keep theFrench informed, as to the progress made.    mhe french ministers had not objected, to this procedure, providedthat they were brought into the negotiations at theappropriate stage.
ITALYi So far as the negotiations with Italy were con-j0rm of cerned, the French Ministers were particularly anxiousoropos edIjegotia- that conversations should not take place from which theynS&apos; were totally excluded.    He and his  colleagues had pro-(previous reference:       posed to get over this difficulty by telling the ItalianCabinet 43(37) , Con- Government at the outset that our proposals resulted fromelus ion 7 .)talks with the French Government, who would have to bebrought in at the appropriate stage.The Secretary o^ State for /ir suggested tha.t thenegotiations on different subjects ought to be more orless  contemporaneous.The Lord President of the Council agreed that thediscussions ought to be simultaneous, as parts of onewhole.   He.raised the question, however, of w;hat wasmesnt by the phrase &quot;a general settlement&quot;.   He recalled that- the Staff of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Berlin had suggested that the German idea of a general settlement was rather different, from, our idea..    It might be foundthat the Germans wanted to stand &quot;out o^ the League ofNations and were making every difficulty about disabled.rma-ment.So far as Central Europe was concerned, even theFrench had admitted that the utmost we coul^ hope forwould, be to get the Germans to repea.t previous undertaking -ings.

Tt might hebetter to refer to their undertakings and to assume thatthey intended to carry them out,Referring to the League of -&quot;aiions, he pointed, outthat the French insistence on Article 15 had been oneof the hindrances to improved relations with Germany.As to the re-armament programmes, he stated that production was now taking place.    For example, in thenear future he hoped to report satisfactory arrangementsfor the production of anti-aircraft guns.    Vhen theForeign Secretary spoke of success depending on our re-armament programmes, did he merely mean the completionof those programmes or their intensification?    Thelatter could not take place except by revoking thedecision not to interfere with civil industry, whichhe assumed at the present time was out of the question.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,he referred to the programmes rather generally, and. he.dnot mentioned either the pace or the degree of re-armament oThe President of the Board of Trade said that as this question ha.d been mentioned he felt he ought to warn the Cabinet that there were some signs of a recessionof trade and. manufacture, the first symptoms of whichwere a fall in commodity prices.    If this were continuedan acceleration in armaments might be very helpful.^he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inreply to a ques + ion, said that. French armaments had beendiscussed to a certain extent at the meetings.
So far as air armaments were concerned, theFrench Ministers had explained that they had a veryexpensive Army and that they had. to do a. certain amountfor the Na\ry:    consequently the Air Force had&apos;fallena little behindhand, but. th&quot;t they were going to spenda good, deal of money, and he understood that they were going to make purchases in America.The First Lord of the Admiralty presumed that the eventual aim in contemplation was a new Treaty toreplace the Treaty of Versailles.^he Cabinet took note  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs would warn the German Governmentthat the matters raised in the conversa-tions between the Lord President of theCouncil and Herr Hitler would require a.good deal of exploration and that theymust not be disappointed if some timeelapsed before a further approach couldbe made:(b) That the question of colonies would be studied by both the British and. french governments with a view to a furtherinterchange of views:( c) That the British enquiry woul* be under-taken in the first instance by the CabinetCommittee on Foreign Policy:(d) That steps would be taken with a view toa start being made with the proposed conversations with Italy, and that, theItalian Government would, be told thatour approach was ma.de after consultationwith the French Government.
RISH FREE 6&quot;      The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsTATE.____ handed round a despatch dated the 24th November whichelations L ^ /Wf^^Jhe had received from Mr, d.e Valera.^    He recalled his(v^previous recent conversations with Mr, de Valera, as the resultReference:Cabinet 38 (37)    of which he had promised to prepare Papers for conclusion 13. )consideration by the Irish Situation Committee in thefirst place.     These were almost ready for circulation,but he was holding a preliminary discussion on themwith the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of theExchequer.     He proposed that the new despatch shouldbe considered in the first instance by the irish situation Committee in connection with the otherPapersc     He was not prepared to give, with any confidence, an estimate of the significance of that document.      It might mean that Mr. de &quot;valera was nowin a more  yielding   mood.      In the past, Mr. de valera had always been opposed to Ministerial talks until some basis of agreement was found.     At present, however,he was in great difficulties which   were partlypolitical and partly economic,     He himself felt,however, rather sceptical about so rigid a mind.      he proposed to see the Irish Free State High Commissionerthe same afternoon to see if he could find out anymore as to what was in Mr. de Valera&apos;s mindo     His own view was that we.should not refuse the proposal.Apart from anything else, it would be very bad tacticsto do so.      If the proposal were to be accepted, therewere advantages in early acceptance in principle,because, first, Mr. de Valera had asked for an earlyreply and, second, he had information that there was agood deal of scepticism in Dublin as to our reply.      Itwould help our friends in Ireland if a reply was sent
at once a     He, therefore, made the following proposalto the Cabinet, which the Cabinet accepted:-That the Irish Situation Committee beauthorised to draft an interim replyfor the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to send to Mr. de Valeraaccepting his proposal in principle,though perhaps containing guardedsentences regarding the time and circumstances of the proposed meeting.

The Local Authorities (Hours ofEmployment in connection with Hospitals and Institutions)Bill would be opposed on the ground that the Governmenthad already set up a Committee on the Nursing Profession.,and that the Bill was premature.The Prime Minister pointed out that theeffect of the Bill would apparently be to compel the voluntary hospitals to do the same as the localauthorities&apos; hospitals which, in effect, would destroythem.The Cabinet approved the line proposedby the Minister of Health.

The Cabinet had under consideration theSecretary of State for -Vales and Monmouthshire Bill,introduced in the House of Commons by a Private member and down for Second Reading on Friday, 3rd December,1937.The Prime Minister said that the private member responsible for this Bill had approached theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the HomeOffice and haa expressed himself very anxious toobtain a Second Reading for the Bill.     He had suggested,, therefore, that the Government should grant the Second Reading, but should make clear that theycould not move a financial resolution^     He was informed, however, that the Home Secretary (who was absent indisposed) was oppoeed to a Second Readingfor the Bill and he did not propose to grant it.As mentioned in the preceding conclusion,  this could be achieved by prolonging the discussion onthe preceding Bill.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesagreed that there should be no Second Reading of this bill but warned the Cabinet that the principle ofthe Bill had support among Welsh members of all parties and care ought to be exercised about dampingdown Welsh nationalism too heavily.The Cabinet agreed:That, if possible, a Second Readingshould not be given to the Secretaryof State for Wales and MonmouthshireBill, and that this should be avoidedas mentioned in the preceding-conclusion by ensuring a prolongation of the discussion of the LocalAuthorities (Hours of Employment inconnection with Hospitals and institutions) Billo

StSRLOC 15o      The Minister of Health recalled that theTDGE.Cabinet,at a meeting referred to in the margin, hadreviouseference: agreed that he should, see Mr. Morrison,  the Chairmanabinet 39 (37)occlusion 12.) of the London County Council in connection with twosubjects, namely, Air Raid Precautions and transportmatters, on which the Minister of Transport was anxiousto reach a settlement,,     He had avoided proceeding faron the transport question, which was one for theMinister of Transport, as he was anxious to see what attitude Mr. Morrison would take in the discussions onthe Air Raid Precautions Billo      He understood thatthe Home Secretary was now fairly satisfied as toMr. Morrison&apos;s attitude on the latter question and considered his relations not unsatisfactory.     he proposed to the Cabinet, therefore, that the Minister ofTransport should proceed with his negotiations0The Prime Minister thanked the Minister ofHealth for the valuable work he had done as an intermediary with Mr. Morrison and asked the Ministerof Transport to explain the position.The Minister of Transport said that what he wanted was a general appeasement with the London CountyCouncilo      Comparing the position with that which facesus over German negotiations, he said that the settlementof Waterloo Bridge took the place in these negotiations that the Colonies took in those with Germany,,     Hecould not accomplish anything important in transport in London without a settlement as regards the bridge.This would involve a (jontritoution of  400,000towards the bridge.      The question,  therefore, was asto whether the vendetta over the bridge, which had nowbeen pulled down, was to be continued on a different basis or not.     He believed that for a sum of  400,000
the Government could get a general settlementredounding to the great advantage of London.In reply to the Prime Minister, he said thatarrangements could &quot;be made to ensure the concession&quot;being represented as part of the general settlement.The Prime Minister thought it would hevery wrong and bad tactics to pursue the quarrelover Waterloo Bridge any further.      It was commonsense to go forward with the Minister of Transportsproposal.The Cabinet agreed:That the Minister of Transport shouldhave authority to negotiate a generalcettlement with the Chairman of theLondon County Council, as part ofwhich he should be authorised tooffer a contribution of  400,000towards Waterloo Bridge.

5. This being the case, the Government ofSoarstat Eireann are satisfied, that piecemeal discussion between civil servants on the economic and other aspectsof the situation that would arise in the case of a major war can achieve no useful purpose until someprior understanding in principle has been reached betweenthe two Governments.5. My Government consider it essential, therefore,that members of the two Governments should meet as soonas possible to consider all the important mattersinvolved,  and would be glad to have an early intimationof the views of your Government on this proposal.I have etc.(Signed) EAMON DS VALERA.Minister for External Affairs.
