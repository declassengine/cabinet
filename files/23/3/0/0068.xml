Gasparri to His Majesty the King, covering a Note by the Popeto the heads of the belligerent peoples, dated the 1st August,1917 (Paper G.T.-1712).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs indicated to theWar Cabinet the attitude of our Allies on the subject so far as itwas at present known, which is as follows : France. M. Ribot considers that it will suffice to reply by areceipt in the ordinary form. If Mr. Balfour considersa more formal answer necessary the two governments must meet. On the other hand, a personal letter fromM. Albert Thomas to the Prime Minister was read which indicated that, in his opinion, the Allies ought to give a collective reply.99 9w --J  rlPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1917.
Italy. Baron Sonnino is not at present disposed to send anyanswer, and expressed the opinion that the experience ofthe previous collective answer to the President of theUnited States was not very encouraging. (Rometelegram No. 702, dated the 19th August, 1917.)Mr. Balfour pointed out that neither Italy norFrance was in a position to give a direct reply, as theywere not in diplomatic relations with the Pope.Russia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs considers the pope:s appeal as purely pro-German, and has orderedRussian representatives abroad to propose that theAllies should make some suitable joint answer.(Petrograd telegram No. 1275, dated the 17th August,1917.)United States of America. Information has been receivedfrom a private but reliable source to the effect that president Wilson is doubtful if he will reply at all, butthat if he does, his answer will probably take the form ofan appreciation of the humanitarian consideration whichhad animated the Pope&apos;s reply, but will point out thefollowing objections (1.) That there is no ground for the belief that the Pope&apos;sproposals would meet the views of any belligerent,and for this reason they did not form a good basis for negotiation.(2.) That they practically advocate the status quo beforethe war.(3.) That the entire disregard of international Law bythe enemy makes it impossible to rely on anyundertakings that he might give, and thatGermany is morally bankrupt. President Wilson,however, was understood to hold the view that the door to negotiation should not be entirely closed.Mr. Balfour drew attention to the fact that the BritishGovernment had already acknowledged the receipt of the Pope&apos;note, and in doing so had stated that his proposals had beenreceived with the most sincere appreciation of their lofty andbenevolent intentions, and that they would be studied by HisMajesty&apos;s Government with the closest and most serious attention.(Foreign Office telegram to the Vatican, No. 30, dated the 16thAugust, 1917.)In the discussion stress was laid on the point that a complete and reciprocal condonation, as suggested by the Pope, wasinadmissible. It was impossible to deal with the German Govern-ment as if they were animated by the same principles as theAllied nations.The discussion centred mainly upon the question of whetherthe Allies ought to reply to the Pope&apos;s proposals by a re-statementof their war aims. It was generally agreed that this was not desirable. Although the reply of the Allies to President WllsoiFsPeace Note, concerted at an&quot; Anglo-French Conference on the26th-28th December, 1916 (Paper I.C.-13), had produced good results in inclining the President of the United States to makecommon cause with the Allies, its effect in other neutral countries had not been favourable. Moreover, in the enemy countries its effect had been to enable the Governments to stimulate theirpeoples to still greater efforts by the implication that unless theycontinued the war to a successful conclusion they would sufferirretrievable loss. It was recognised that it would be verydifficult at any Conference of the. Allies to state our war aims in aless drastic manner. The moment any reduction of the war aims of any particular belligerent was suggested the danger would arisethat that belligerent would relax its efforts. For this reason itwas generally agreed that it was undesirable to revive the idea of a
Propaganda inGreat Britainagainst PeaceCampaign.[1365-2. In the course of the discussion stress was laid on theimportance of taking more active steps to combat peace propa-ganda in this country, and attention was drawn to the fact that asimilar opinion had been expressed by the War Cabinet on the5th June, 1917. (War Cabinet 154, Minute 22.) It was.-220] B 2Conference for the revision of treaties, for which the RussianGovernment had been pressing a month ago, but which had nowfallen somewhat in the background. (War Cabinet 187, Minute19.)It was further pointed out that the reply of the Allies to president *Wilson had been used as anti-war propaganda in. this and other countries to prove that our war aims were imperialisticand grasping. Although there was not the smallest desire to repudiate them, it was suggested that our desiderata as expressedin january might with advantage be allowed to fall into the back-ground. It was suggested that this might be achieved by encouraging President Wilson, who stands somewhat aloof fromthe general cause of the Allies, to send a reply stating the idealand moral objects for which the Allies are fighting. It would thenbe in our power, if convenient, to express our concurrence in this reply.It was pointed out that there was no particular reason whythe Allies should give their answer, if they send one at all, beforethe Central Powers. In reply to President Wilson&apos;s Peace note the Allies had stated their war aims fully and frankly, but theCentral Powers had not reciprocated, and had contented them-selves with a statement that they would be prepared to formulatetheir peace terms at a Conference. It was suggested, therefore,that, on the present occasion, the Allies might intimate that they see no reason to send a reply before the Central Powers. If thispolicy was adopted it was suggested that it would be advisable that President Wilson should not be urged to reply until theCentral Powers had been allowed ample time in which to formulate their terms. If these terms included the evacuation ofBelgium it would show a marked advance on the part of theCentral Powers towards a settlement. If, on the contrary, theyshowed no such intention it would prove that no basis whatsoeverfor discussion existed. If they again offered to state their termsat a Conference we should reply that we could not enter aConference unless there was a reasonable basis for negotiation.On a.review of the foregoing considerations, the War cabinet decided that (1.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should conveyan intimation to the Vatican in the sense that, in replyto President Wilson &apos;s Peace Note, the Allies hadformulated their Avar aims, but the Central powers had not, and that on the present occasion we did not propose to send any detailed answer until we hadreceived the reply of the Central Powers. Mr. Balfourundertook to draft this telegram in such a manner asto avoid a previous correspondence with a view to their concurrence.(2.) That no immediate action should be taken to encouragePresident Wilson to send a reply, but that if after areasonable lapse of time the Central Powers did notformulate their peace terms the question should bere considered with a view to the possibility of a separatereply by President Wilson in which the moral andideal objects for which the Allies are fighting might be stated, a reply in which the British Government couldassociate itself, if this was deemed politic at themoment.
suggested that this was a task which ought to fall within theprovince of the Government Whips, but it was stated that nofunds were available for the purpose.The question was adjourned for further consideration.The Economic 3. At the request of the Secretary  of  State  for  ForeignWeapon:    ^ Affairs, Lord Robert Cecil invited  the  attention  of  the WarM. Clementefs Cabinet to certain proposals that had been outlined to him byProposals. M. Clementel, the French Minister of Commerce, who is on a visit to this country.     M. Clementel had pointed out to him that,although the Germans as the result of the war had a very extensiveterritorial war map, the Allies had a no less complete economicwar map, insomuch as between them they controlled fourteen orfifteen of the principal essential raw materials of the world.    Inorder to render this weapon fully effective as a bargaining asset inthe eventual peace negotiations, however, further organisation was required.     First, an agreement was necessary between GreatBritain and France, after which it would be necessary to induce the United States of America to participate in the scheme.    M.Clementel&apos;s proposals were  that when  our  organisation was complete we should let the enemy know that we had entire controlof these essential raw materials, and that if, after the lapse of acertain period of time, they did not accept peace on our terms,no matter what the state of the war, we should never permit themto obtain them.     In fact, what M. Clementel proposed was aneconomic offensive.     The War Cabinet ought to bear in mind,however, that M. Clementel appeared to have two objects in view :one was to use this weapon against the enemy, but the other wasto reach an agreement by which the French should secure a certainproportion of the raw materials under our control, and no longer be dependent upon our bounty in respect to them.Lord Robert Cecil expressed the view that up to now we hadnot made quite enough of our economic strength, although matters were steadily improving in this respect. Some progress hadalready been made towards the realisation of M. ClementeTsscheme. For instance, the Allies were pooling their purchases of wheat, and already had control of a great deal of the overseasproduce of wheat. M. Clementel proposed to supplement thisby a scheme for buying up the Argentine wheat supply and by theextension of the same principle to other raw materials. M.Clementel further proposed that this economic weapon, whenfully organised, might be utilised after the war as a means of keeping the peace, and he rather relied on this aspect of thequestion to secure the adhesion of President Wilson to the scheme.M. Clementel had promised to forward a detailed scheme whichhe had worked out.The Prime Minister stated that Mr. Whitley, the Chairmanof Committees, had formulated a somewhat similar scheme. Hehad pointed out that we had control of a great many articles of prime necessity, such as tungsten, jute, vegetable oils, &amp;c.; his idea was that we should give Germany six months&apos; notice, andthat if within that time the enemy did not come to terms we shouldwarn them that they would be denied these and other rawmaterials for a period of twenty years. He proposed to supple-ment this, by an extra charge on the ships of our present enemiesfor harbour dues for a period of years for every Alliedship sunk. It was pointed out that another scheme had beenthat for a fixed period after the war the Allies should refuse coalat their coaling stations unless Germany would come to terms.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that one of the advan-tages claimed for the scheme was that the enemy could not make an effective reply, potash being the only important raw material of which they had anything like a monopoly.     The enemy was
alleged to be seeking to form an economic combine in the Balkans,but they could not achieve anything effective here, although theycould break the Allies&apos; monopoly in respect to some articles, suchas mineral oils.As an objection to M. Clementehs plan it was pointed outthat it might merely have the effect of stimulating the enemy to greater efforts, just as the Allies&apos; reply to President ,Wilson&apos;sPeace Note had been utilised in order to convince the enemy peoplesthat the Allies were bent on their destruction unless they achievedvictory. This, it was suggested, would almost certainly be theeffect on the British nation of any corresponding threat by theenemy if the positions were reversed. It was also pointed out thatif we did not win the war the enemy would comjael us to abandonany economic plans of this nature that had been formed.The War Cabinet were reminded, however, that many hintshad been conveyed in newspaper articles, telegrams from neutral countries, &amp;c, that the enemy was most seriously apprehensive of some movement of the kind.It was agreed that the economic factor provided assets ofgreat value to the Allies, and that peace would very likely in theend be a balance of and compromise between the territorialvictories of the enemy and the economic advantages of the Allies,and that from this point of view it was desirable to investigate thematter fully. The view was expressed, however, that the plan was likely to be more effective as a bargaining asset in the termsof peace than as a means of keeping peace after the war. owing tothe difficulty in securing its practical working. Russia, forexample, with its unexplored potentialities, was to some extent an unknown factor. It was generally agreed that anv announce-ment of such a scheme would require very careful consideration,both as to the form and time.One method suggested was that the idea should be spreadabout with a view to its discussion by experts and in the Press, but against this it was stated that M. Clementel laid great stress onsecrecj&quot;.It was suggested that possibly the stalemate in the militaryoperations might become so complete that it might be necessaryto fall back on a passive defensive; to hold the line with the smallest possible number of men compatible with safety, and thus to release as much man power as possible for industry, and simply to rely upon the blockade to bring about the collapse of the enemy,just as often occurred in the case of a siege. In this case less steelwould be required for military purposes, more labour would beavailable, and the Allies could probably build sufficient shipping to defeat the submarine campaign.- The War Cabinet decided that-The President of the Board of Trade, after consultation withother Departments concerned, such as the Foreign Office,Ministry of Blockade, and Ministry of Munitions, should examine M. Clementel&apos;s scheme and report to the WarCabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 20, 1917.
