Submarines.Hostile Air-raid onAugust 12.9. The First Sea Lord reported that the German aeroplanes,which, so far as he had received information, were twelve in number,had been picked up by a patrol of naval machines on the Belgiancoast, pursued to England, and had been followed back on their return journey by a second air patrol; that one Gotha twin-enginedmachine had been brought down over the North Sea by a machinefrom Walmer, and that one German seaplane had nose-dived intothe sea off the coast of Flanders.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that some fortybombs had been dropped at Bochford, Margate, and Southend. Twoof our air squadrons had engaged the enemy, and that in all about100 British aeroplanes had ascended.Convoys.The &quot; City ofAthens.&quot;10. In reference to War Cabinet 198, Minute 8, the First sea lord reported that, out of a convoy of ten vessels which had beenescorted by one whaler and three destroyers, the two ships whichhad been sunk by the enemy had been in the centre line of the convoy, which fact was somewhat disquieting.11. The First Sea Lord stated that the steamship &quot;City ofAthens,&quot; which had been sunk north-west of Cape Town, had probably struck a mine in a minefield laid by the German raidersome time ago.The Return of WarCabinet Papers.12. The Secretary referred to a note, dated the 13th August,which he had received from Mr. Arthur Henderson&apos;s private secretary,on the subject of the retention of War Cabinet documents(Appendix I), and requested the instructions of the War Cabinet onthe matter. He explained that before the war the policy of theCommittee of Imperial Defence had been to recover all papers (99thMeeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on 14th May,1908, Minute 3), but since the War Cabinet had been in existencethe Cabinet precedent of documents remaining the property of members had been followed. He also explained that some of the papers issued to members of the War Cabinet, which Mr. Henderson as a memberhad received, were of the most secret nature, and that, if they remained in the-possession of any member of the War Cabinet after he had left that body, there was, in the event of his death, consider-able danger of their going astray and getting into wrong hands.The consideration of the question of what policy should beadopted in the case of War Cabinet documents was.adjourned.The stockholm conference:Announcement ofGovernmentdecision.1.3. The War Cabinet had under discussion the nature of the replies to be given to certain parliamentary questions which wouldbe put in regard to the Stockholm Conference.In view of the decision given in War Cabinet 211, that british representatives should not be permitted to attend the stockholm conference, the only question which arose in this connection was asto whether the announcement of this policy should be made in answer to questions put in the House, or in the Prime Ministers speech which would follow Mr. Hendersoifs personal statement.[1365-213]B 28. The First Sea Lord reported that on the 9th August a navalairship had dropped bombs on an enemy submarine; that the destroyer .&quot; Bullfinch&quot; claimed on the same day to have sunk a submarine which was attacking a convoy ; and that the destroyer&quot; Oracle &quot; had been badly damaged by ramming and sinking a thirdU-boat.
The War Cabinet decided that On account of the strong feeling being exhibited on this question,the announcement should be made at the earliest possible moment, i.e., in reply to parliamentary questions.       *Position of The Prime Minister explained that he had seen M. Nabokoff,M. Nabokoff. who had expressed himself as being alarmed by what he had read inthe &quot; Daily News,&quot; and somewhat anxious as to his own position if mr. Henderson made public the fact that a communication (see WarCabinet 210, Minute 12) had been made by him, and had asked forthe support of the War Cabinet in the matter.The War Cabinet agreed that M. Nabokoff&apos;s action in this matter had been of great service tohis own country and of great service to the Allies; thatthey would support him by every means in their power;and that he should not be mentioned as the agency throughwhom the message from the Russian Foreign Minister wasreceived.Parliamentary 15. The general opinion of the War Cabinet was that it wouldProcedure. he most advisable to have a debate in the House on the question raised by Mr. Henderson&apos;s resignation from membership of the WarCabinet at the earliest possible moment. Whether, from the pointof view of parliamentary procedure, it would be possible to have a debate on the afternoon of the 13th August was a question whichcould only be decided after consultation with the Speaker of theHouse of Commons. Up to the time of discussion, the Governmenthad not been able to make clear its views on this subject, with theresult that the public did not understand the position.Use of Official 16.   In reference to War Cabinet 212, Minute 1, the PrimeTelegrams. Minister stated that he had been notified by Mr. Henderson that he proposed to read out telegram No. 1180, dated the 2nd August,1917, from Petrograd, in which, in reply to Mr. BalfouFs telegramNo. 1597 of the previous day, Sir George Buchanan had informed the British Government of the attitude of elements of the lateRussian Government towards the Stockholm Conference.It was agreed that the telegram ought not to be quoted in full,since it dealt with the personal views of particular Ministers, thoseof M. Kerensky being conveyed at second hand through &quot; anintimate friend,&quot; and even indicated differences of opinion betweenthe members of the Russian Government.The Secretary drew the attention of the War Cabinet to thefact that the telegram could not in any case be quoted textually,since it was a decypher and not a paraphrase.On the other hand, it was agreed that Mr. Henderson, who wason his defence, should be given all facilities for utilising as much ofthe information as was necessary to his case and was compatible withthe public interest.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should have a personalinterview with Mr. Henderson before he made his statement,and arrange with him, on the above lines, what he shouldmake public.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should also point out to Mr. Henderson that it was in the highest degreeundesirable that M. NabokofFs communication No. 1328 ofthe 8th August (Appendix II) should be read out in full.
IS. The point was raised as to what answer should be given inthe House if Mr. Henderson asked what difference there was between the attitude of the Russian Government, as evinced in telegram No. 11S0 of the 2nd August, and as described inM. Nabokoffs message. It was pointed out that, while the formerwas merely an expression of Sir George Buchanans personal belief asto the opinions of particular elements in the Russian Ministry, thelatter was a formal and official statement of the considered views ofthe Russian Government as a whole.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 13, 1917.The New Factors 17. It was suggested that the important point on which them the Question. Government must &quot;be prepared with their reply to Mr. Hendersonwas the answer to the question of what new factors had arisen tomake the Government change the attitude taken by them on the21st May, 1917, when, with the agreement of the War Cabinet,telegram No. 1027, dated the 21st May, 1917, had been sent by thePrime Minister to M. Thomas, rather favouring the representationof the Western Allies at Stockholm (see also War Cabinet 141,Minute 15, of the 21st May, 1917).The reason for this change of attitude were, that in May theRussian Government was in the hands of the Workmen&apos;s andSoldiers&apos; Committee, and, under its influence, were then inclinedstrongly in favour of the Stockholm Conference, and that the BritishGovernment were in this matter, to a great extent, influenced bytheir desire to support the authority of a newly,formed body whichhad not yet firmly established itself. The consequence of theinfluence exerted by the Soviet, howrever, had been to shatter the discipline of the Russian army and the organisation of the nation,and the Russian Government was at the moment taking measures tore-establish discipline in their forces by means which were absolutelycontrary to the principles of the Soviet, and showed that the policyof the extreme revolutionaries had been discredited.To permit the attendance of British representatives at the stockholm Conference, which was tantamount to countenancingfraternisation between one section of the Allied British public andone section of the enemy public, would be very prejudicial to thepolicy which the Russian Government was engaged on and was pressing forward, the very first item of which was the prohibition offraternisation between Russian troops and those of the enemy.It wras recognised that no difficulty would be found in proving,on the above lines, that the conditions had completely changed since may 1917, but that there would be considerable difficulty in doino;so without embarrassing M. Kerensky.The War Cabinet felt that the Prime Minister would himselfhave to use the greatest discretion in dealing with this matter inParliament, that he should intimate to the House the difficulty inwhich the Government were placed, and should bring out clearly thegreat disservice which Mr. Henderson had done, both to M. Kerenskyand the Russian Government, in raising this question at thisprecise moment.
APPENDIX I.Mr. HENDERSON submitted his resignation to the Prime Minister at ,1.0-45on Saturday, the 11th August. At the same time he instructed me to make enquiriesfrom the private secretary of a Minister recently resigned in order to ascertain whatpapers he might take away with him and what papers should be left for his successor.I pointed out to Mi&apos;. Henderson that there was no precedent which covered his jDOsition,because he was the first member of the War Cabinet, being Minister without portfolio,to resign, and the usual distinction made between papers sent to the Minister as Headof a Department and as a member of the Cabinet could not be made in his case.Mr. Henderson cited the case of Mr. Asquith, and suggested that if he took with himall the papers of the War Committee that would form a satisfactory precedent. it seemed to me that the two cases were not analogous.After long consideration Mr. Henderson decided that his proper course would be totake with him all papers which had been issued to him whilst he was a member ofthe War Cabinet and present in this country. At the same time, he is quite preparedto return any papers if the War Cabinet consider that he should do so. I attach a listof the papers which I despatched on Saturday afternoon by motor-car to his private house.G. M. HODGSON.August 13, 1917.APPENDIX II.M. Nabokoff to Mr. Balfour.(No. 1328.   Urgent and Strictly Confidential.)Your Excellency, Russian Embassy, London, August 8, 1917.IN a telegram I sent to the Russian Foreign Minister three or four days ago Igave him an account of&quot; the statements made in the House of Commons by the PrimeMinister and Mr. Henderson concerning the latteFs visit to Paris, as well as ofMr. Bonar Law&apos;s statements regarding the Stockholm Conference and of the discussions which were taking place in the different labour organisations of Great Britain as tothe desirability of sending delegates to Stockholm. I also drew the Russian foreign ministers attention to the reply given by the American Federation of Labour to theFrench Confederation generate du Travail. In conclusion I said the following : &quot; Iconsider it absolutely necessary, with a view to safeguarding the stability and closenessof our union with Great Britain, where the majority of public opinion is adverse to theConference, that I should be in a position to declare most emphatically to Mr. Balfourthat the Russian Government, as well as His Majesty&apos;s Government, regard this matter as a party concern and not a matter of State, and that the decisions of the Conference,should it be convened, would in no way be binding on the future course of Russian,policy and of Russia&apos;s relations with her Allies.&quot;In reply to this message I have just received the following telegram : &quot; I entirelyapprove of the declaration to be made to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the sensesuggested by yqu, and you are hereby authorised to inform the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs that, although the Russian Government do not deem it possible toprevent Russian delegates from taking part in the Stockholm Conference, they regard this Conference as a party concern and its decisions in no wise binding upon the liberty of action of the Government.&quot;I hasten to lay before you the above information, as I fear that the impression hashitherto prevailed that, in the words of one of the London newspapers, &quot; Russiaardently desired the Stockholm Conference,&quot; and this argument has been put forward in order to influence British public opinion in favour of the Labour and Socialist parties of Great Britain participating in the Conference.I have, &amp;c.(Signed) C. NABOKOFF.
