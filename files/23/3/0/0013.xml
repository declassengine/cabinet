Miss Sylvia 1. THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  raised thePankhurst: question of the desirability of granting a passport to Miss SylviaThe Question of Pankhurst to proceed to Russia. - In his opinion it was mostPassport to Eussia.    inadvisable to grant h er a permit, as in that event it would be practically impossible to refuse  permission  in any  future case,however undesirable the applicant might be.The War Cabinet decided that No passport should be given to Miss Pankhurst, and that, inthe event of the matter being raised in Parliament, their decision should be defended on the ground that this ladyis connected with ,an active pacifist movement in thiscountry, that she represents no important body of publicopinion, and that the Russian Government have not asked that she should be permitted to proceed.Prisoners of War. 2. With reference to War Cabinet 164, Minute 10, Lord robert cecil stated that the French Government still adhered to their objections to the proposed meeting with German representatives atThe Hague in order to discuss the treatment of prisoners of war.M. Ribot had admitted that the French had sent representatives toBerne to attend a meeting of a similar character to that nowproposed, but had added that careful arrangements had been made that the French delegates should not actually meet the Germanrepresentatives, a Swiss subject acting as intermediary betweenthe two parties.The Director of Military Intelligence agreed with the views ofthe French Government as to the inexpediency of the meeting.Lord Robert Cecil said that Lord Newton had expressed theview that, if the meeting took place, there should be a third british representative besides himself and General Belfield, as the germans were sending three delegates, and he had suggested that Mr. JusticeYounger should accompany himself and General Belfield. Analternative suggestion was that Mrs. Livingstone, who wasthoroughly acquainted with the whole question of the treatment ofprisoners of war, and who was thoroughly competent and trust-worthy, should accompany the party.The War Cabinet decided that -- Lord Newton and General Belfield should be authorised toproceed to The Hague, and that Mr. Justice Youngershould be invited to accompany them; and, further, thatin the event of Mr. Justice Younger not being able toaccept the invitation, an additional military officer shouldbe sent.The Western Front. 3. The Director of Military Intelligence communicated detailsof a minor incident in the recent operations, when the British forces had been compelled temporarily to give up a small portion of theground which they had gained. What had actually happened wasthat, on the 18th instant, our troops had been forced to evacuate asmall section of ground on a front of 500 yards only. The matter was of very minor importance, and had, so far, not been mentionedin the German official communique. The ground relinquished hadbeen in the vicinity of the posts which we had established to theeast of Monchy.Naval Losses.4. The First Sea Lord reported that the destroyer &quot; Tartar &quot;had struck a mine on the 17th instant, and had been badly damaged, but had been towed into Dover; that a trawler had been
lost on the same day whilst sweeping off Boulogne; and that on the18th instant an armed trawler had been torpedoed and sunk off theShetland Islands.Submarines. 5. The First Sea Lord reported various actions with enemy submarines during the hist four days. He stated that a Britishdestroyer reported having successfully attacked an enemy submarinenear St. Catherines.He made his usual statement of shipping losses.6. The First Sea Lord reported that an Air Squadron from dunkirk had bombed the St. Denis Westrem Aerodrome on the15th instant with successful results, and. that another Air Squadronhad carried out an effective bombing raid on Bruges Harbour,causing very considerable damage to the slapping there.Bombing Raids onSt. Denis Westremand Bruges.Attack on aZeppelin;7. The First Sea Lord reported that a seaplane from Yarmouthhad engaged a Zeppelin on the night of the recent air-raid, withunknown results. The seaplane had attacked the Zeppelin at aheight of 1 1,000 feet, but had been unable to follow it to a higheraltitude.Future of german colonies in the pacific. ,8. The Secretary of State for the Colonies submitted to theWar Cabinet telegraphic correspondence with the Dominion ofNew Zealand (Paper G.T.-1038) (Appendix I). In a telegram ofthe 13th June (D), the&quot; New Zealand Government had enquired ifthere was any objection on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government tothe King&apos;s Speech at the opening of the Dominion Parliamentembodying the gist of their telegram of the 12th June (C), whichexpressed the strongest objection on the part of New Zealand to therestoration to Germany of her former possessions in the Pacific.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed, out that a refusalon the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to agree to the course proposed would arouse the greatest suspicion in the Dominion, and suggest that there was, on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, a departure from what the Dominion Ministers had understood to beits policy at the time of the Session of the Imperial War Cabinet.The War Cabinet concurred, and instructed -The Secretary of State for the Colonies to inform theGovernment of New Zealand that there was no objectionto the course which they proposed to take.Proposed Agree-ment between the major JEidmitePowers regardingDefence againstMaritime Attack.9. With reference to War Cabinet 142, Minute 12, theSecretarv of State for Foreign Affairs invited the early considerationof the War Cabinet of the question of capital ships in the UnitedStates, and the possibility of some guarantee being given to theUnited States Government, provided they were willing to forgo thisconstruction in favour of light craft. He suggested a formula (paper g.T.-1090) (Appendix II), which he thought might form the basisof discussion.In introducing the subject, Mr. Balfour pointed out that important diplomatic considerations were involved, as it would benecessary to devise diplomatic instruments to give effect to his suggestion if it were accepted by the W&quot;ar Cabinet, and commendeditself to the other Powers concerned.
Powers of theA ecommodation&quot;Committee.The War Cabinet asked The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to develop his views in a Note to be submitted for their consideration at anearly date. *10. The War Cabinet had before them a Minute and Memo-randum, dated the 7th June, 1917, and a Note dated the 15th June,by the First Commissioner of Works (Papers G.T.-1019 and 1063),asking that either he himself or the Committee of Accommodationshould be given Cabinet authority to decide all matters of accommo-dation required for Government Departments exclusive of pre-warestablishments. The Memorandum also suggested that the con-stitution of the Committee should be strengthened by the additionof another Minister.The War Cabinet decided that Sir Alfred Mond&apos;s Committee should be granted the necessaryauthority, and they approved the suggested addition.Committee ofTrade after theWar :Publication ofEeports.11. The War Cabinet considered a Note by the Board of Trade(Paper G.T.-1029), and a letter from Mr. Montagu to Sir albert stanley (Paper G.T.-1043), relative to the publication of the Eeportsof the various Committees set up by that Department in 1916 toconsider what steps mioht be necessary in order to safeguard theposition of important British industries after the war. Both themembers of the Committees and the interested trades were generallyanxious that the Reports should be published without delay, and,unless the Department had Government authority to withhold publi-cation, it would be exposed to the charge of suppressing the reports in its own interests.The War Cabinet were reminded that earlier in the month theyhad considered the desirability or otherwise of issuing the Reporton Joint Standing Industrial Councils (War Cabinet 157, Minute 12)They had decided that, in the first place, the Report should be circulated to the leading Trades Unions and Employers&apos; Associa-tions, and also to the Commissioners on Industrial Unrest. Events,however, had shown that the wisdom of that decision was open to question.   (See also the following Minute.)A wide circulation of confidential matter must involve the riskof leakage, and garbled versions would almost certainly appearsooner or later in the press. Tiie publication of the reports of individual trades was probably undesirable. It was further pointedout that the United States of America were now a belligerent Power,and they were apprehensive of the precise effect upon Americantrade of the resolutions passed at the Paris Conference.On the other hand, the publication did not in airy way commitHis Majesty&apos;s Government to any definite industrial policy, and itenabled the nation to scrutinise proposals which had so far onlytentatively been put forward.The War Cabinet decided that The Committee^ Reports should not be published.reconstruction committee:Report on industrial Councils.12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byMr. G. N. Barnes (Appendix III) on the Report on Joint StandingIndustrial Councils, p anting out that serious difficulty must beanticipated with regard to the decision of the War Cabinet on the7th instant (quoted in Minute 11 above). The Memorandum urgedthat the previous decision should be revised, for the following reasons : (a.) By circulation the Report would lose its confidentialcharacter, and become the subject for general if not freediscussion.
(b.) Parliament would naturally resent the wide circulation ofan important State document without an opportunitybeing given to the two Houses to read it.(c.) The opponents of the scheme would be able to misrepresentits nature without fear of authoritative contradiction.(d.) The important consideration that much of the prevailingindustrial unrest arises from the belief that the Govern-ment are not dealing seriously with the labour question,and are not concerned about the position of the labouringclasses after the war.On the other hand, publication might encourage the belief thatthe Report embodied the Governments settled policy, and was hkelyto give rise to controversy between Unions whose members areskilled and those whose members are unskilled.After some discussion, the War Cabinet decided that Subject to the Prime Ministers approval, as a large number of people were already aware of the contents Of the Report,and as by their former decision a wide circulation had been authorised, the Report should now be published.13. Mr. Barnes stated that he had seen Mr. Havelock Wilson inorder to try and induce him to use his influence with the Sailors&apos;and Firemen&apos;s Union with a view to persuading them not to persistin their embargo upon Mr. Macdonald proceeding to Russia. Hehad found Mr. Wilson considerably piqued at what he regarded asdiscourtesy on the part of the Workmens and Soldiers&apos; Council,which had never acknowledged his congratulatory telegram on thesuccess of the Russian Revolution. Mr. Barnes said that Mr.Henderson had, two days previously, despatched a telegram toMr. Wilson, strongly urging the removal of the embargo, subject toMr. Macdonald giving the undertaking desired by the Seamen&apos;union and on his promising, when in Russia, to act and speak con-sistently with the decisions of the Manchester Conference of Labour.Mr. Barnes further said that he himself had cabled to Mr. Hendersonasking him to suggest to the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council thatthey should send a courteous reply to Mr. Wilson, as this wrould bemore likely than anything else to. solve the present impasse. Hehad not yet received an answer from Mr. Henderson.14. The War Cabinet reviewed their decision, dated the SthMay, 1917 (War Cabinet 124, Minute 12), with reference to theshortage of spirits for industrial purposes in the light of the Reportof the Ministry of Munitions Committee. (Paper G.T.-867) and aMemorandum by the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-9771.Dr. Addison pointed out that the shortage of spirits hadconsiderably increased since-the matter was last before the Cabinet,owing to the diversion of tank steamers used in the importation ofmolasses in order to ensure an adequate supply of oil fuel for theNavy. In the meantime the Cabinet had decided to appoint Com-mittees to deal with the terms of purchase of the Liquor Traffic.If he (Dr. Addison) were to proceed to requisition spirits from bondhe would be pressed to pay a very high price for it. , Spirit whichcould be produced for about 3s. a gallon was being sold at morethan seven times that figure, and the banks had advanced money insome cases to cover purchases at these extravagant figures. Further,if spirit was commandeered by the Ministry of Munitions for industrial purposes, the Government, in accordance with their general liquor policy, would have to deal later on with the distilleriesand the goodwill of the firms concerned. It was, he urged, for theCabinet to consider whether the requisitioning should not be posl-poned until the larger problem was faced or some steps taken
immediately to purchase distilleries, stocks, and goodwill. TheWar Cabinet was given to understand that it might be possible tapurchase perhaps one-half of the distilling business of the country at a figure very much less than was suggested by&apos;the current priceof whiskey.The War Cabinet reaffirmed their decision to obtain thenecessary spirit for industrial purposes by redistillation ofpotable spirits.The War Cabinet further decided that Lord Milner and Dr. Addison should enter into negotiations,through Sir J. Stevenson, for the immediate and completepurchase of as much raw whiskey as possible, togetherwith the distilleries and goodwill thereof.15. With reference to War Cabinet 157, Minute 15, the WarCabinet had before them the following documents : Memorandum by Lord Milner on the Necessity for ImmediateControl of the Liquor Trade and the Machinery for control (Paper G.T.-1070).Note on Civilian Unrest owing to Drink Pestrictions (paper g.T.-1008). &apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;:Memorandum by the Liquor Control Board on the Manufactureof Light Beer (Paper G.T.-1092).Dr. Addison strongly supported the representations containedin the above as to the dissatisfaction in munition areas with the restricted supplies of beer. Complaints were reaching him from many centres, and especially from districts where there had been acurtailed supply of beer and a large increase in the industrial population. He feared that there would be serious trouble if thehot weather continued and there were no increased provision of beer, however much diluted.It was pointed out that the recommendation of the liquor control Board the manufacture of light beer would involve themore rapid consumption of the stocks of malt, and if the demandfor such light beer were at all considerable and uncontrolled, itmight result in the premature exhaustion of the malt stocks. Thenext malting season was due to begin in September, and the PoodController estimated that on the 10,000,000-barrel basis the presentstocks of malt would be exhausted in November. It was important not to bring about a hiatus when there would be no malt at all, byany very large manufacture of light beer. To meet this difficultya policy of dilution could be adopted. By reducing the gravitiesof the heavy be^rs the bulk of the 10,000,000 barrels could be-considerably swollen. This, however, would require control. Itwould be necessary, before adopting either or both these policies,to inform the House of Commons, in accordance with the pledge given by the Leader of the House.It was understood that leading brewers who had been con-suited were willing that control should be undertaken on a basis of guaranteed pre-war profits, and a statement of a well-known brewerwas quoted, to the effect that his profits this year were double thoseof last year because of dilution, the abolition of the long pull, andof credit.If control were assumed at an early date, it would be desirableto give immediate notice to the brewers and wholesale dealers tomake their books up to the 30th June. Further, some time wouldbe required to make the necessary preparations for the manufactureof light beer and the dilution of heavy beer.
3SMachinery for 16. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion  on theControl. machinery for control suggested in Lord Milner&apos;s memorandum, and received reports of the progress made in setting up the Committeesagreed to in War Cabinet 157, Minute 15.(Initialled) A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June      1917.The War Cabinet decided, subject to the Prime Ministersconcurrence (a.) To modify their decision, dated the 7th June, 1917, not totake control until after the Second Reading; of the Bill(War Cabinet 157, Minute 15), and agreed that steps betaken to assume control immediately and to proceedwith dilution;(b.) To guarantee to manufacturers and wholesale dealers,during the whole period of control, their pre-warprofits ;(c.) To postpone for the present the quest&apos;on of financialguarantees to retailers, though it might be foundnecessary to fix retail prices at an early date;(d.) To adopt the recommendations of the Liquor Control board as set forth in their memorandum (Paper G.T.-1092);(e.) That control should not actually be set up until the Houseof Commons had discussed the question ; the Leader ofthe House to arrange for this early next week, when afull statement of the Government policy should bemade.
APPENDIX I.(G.T.-103S.) - *Future of German Colonies in the Pacific.(Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.)I CIRCULATE herewith for consideration the annexed telegraphic correspondence with New Zealand : (A.) To Governor the 9th June (sent also to Australia and South Africa).(B.) From Governor the 11th June.(C.) From Governor the 12th June (being the telegram promised in (B) ).(D.) From Governor the 13th June.(E.)-Draft reply to (C).Telegram (E) does not finally commit His Majesty&apos;s Government, and will doubtless be approved by the Cabinet. But it will be seen from telegram (D) that tl eNew Zealand Government are anxious to embody the gist of telegram (C) in the governors speech at the opening of Parliament on the 28th instant, and I desire tohave the decision of the Cabinet as to the reply to be returned to this request.It will be remembered that the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who is now at sea and should arrive before the opening of Parliament, took part in the discussion of thisquestion in the Imperial War Cabinet, and is in pi ssession of the reports of theTerritorial Changes Committee. He left this country before the revolution in Russia,and has therefore no first-hand knowledge of recent developments.(Initialled) W. H. L.June 14, 1917.(A.)Paraphrase Telegram.The Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of New Zealand.(Sent 9-50 p.m., 9th June, 1917.)(Secret.)Conference of Russian Labour organisations is to be held in Petrograd almost immediately British and Allied Delegations will attend. It is possible that resolutionwill be moved in favour of no annexations. Suggest that good effect would beproduced if Labour party in New Zealand were to cable protest to Chairman ofParliamentary Labour party in this country against return to Germany of her colonies in Pacific. Please let me have views of your Ministers as soon as possible, but cableshould not be despatched till you hear from me again.-Long.(B.)Paraphrase Telegram.From the Governor of Nein Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 3&quot;45 b.m., 11th June, 1917.)(Personal.)Your cypher telegram of 9th June in regard to a resolution from Labour party in new Zealand. Am desired by my Ministers to inform you of the following in strict confidence. The.Labour party in New Zealand consists of so many different units andis so divided in its councils that it would be impossible to get an expression of opinion which could be said to speak for the whole party. &apos; I will cable you, however, an expression of the views of my Ministers speaking on behalf of the whole of theDominion of New Zealand. Liverpool.
(D.)Paraphrase Telegram.The Governor of Neio Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office, 2&quot;50 p.m., 13th June, 1917.)With reference to my telegram 12th June with regard to German colonies,my Ministers are anxious that gist should be embodied in the speech at the openingof Parliament on the 28th of June. They have asked me, however, to consult youbefore doing so in case you saw any objection to such a course. They think at thesame time that it would have a good effect in the Dominion, as practically all classes are strongly opposed to Socialist and pacifist propaganda which has lately appeared inthe press at home and abroad. Should be glad to receive early reply by telegraph. Liverpool.(E.)Draft Telegram to Governor, New Zealand (Cypher).His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under their consideration your telegram of12th June respecting future of German colonies in the Pacific. They recognise the vital importance of the matter to Australia and New Zealand. Your Ministers need nothave any apprehension either that their position is misunderstood or that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will fail to give the fullest weight to their wishes when the time for decision arrives.[995-1]DParaphrase Telegram.The Governor of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 1T55 a.m., 12th June, 1917.)The time has arrived, in the opinion of the Government of New Zealand, when itis necessary to indicate to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the future disposition ofGerman territory in the Pacific is a question of gravest concern. German Samoa hasbeen occupied and is now held by New Zealand troops. Australian troops occupyother German lands in the Pacific. My Government feel respectfully that they cannotconsent to the restoration to Germany of these lands. To do so would be to establish a constant menace to peace and trade in the Pacific, which would demand unnecessarysacrifices from our people in the future; nor can we British people in New Zealandabandon the native population of Samoa, for they are intimately associated with ourMaori brothers by descent and language.The members of the New Zealand Parliament are elected by universal suffrage ;during the war party politics have been abandoned, and this Government^ decision,therefore, represents the will of a democratic people who earnestly desire peace, but on terms which will protect their future freedom. New Zealand is confident that her position will be understood [?] and her wishes respected by the Imperial Governmentand the Allies. Liverpool.
APPENDIX IT.G.T.-1090. -- *Proposed Agreement between the Governments of Great Britain, the United States ofAmerica, France, Italy, Russia, and Japan re Defence against Maritime Attack.(Note by the Secretary.)WITH reference to War Cabinet 142, Minute 12, of the 22nd May, Mr. Balfourwould like the question of capital ships in the United States and the possibility ofsome guarantee being given to the United States Government, provided they are willing to forgo this construction in favour of light craft, brought up at the cabinet as soon as is possible.The following is a copy of a formula which he has drawn up for consideration :  That, in view of the diversion of Government shipbuilding in the navalyards of the United States of America from the construction of capital ships tothat of vessels suitable for anti-submarine warfare, the Governments of theUnited States of America, Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia, and Japan engagesingly and severally to assist each other against any maritime attack for a periodof four years after the conclusion of the present war.(Initialled) M. P. A. H.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 19, 1917.APPENDIX III.Memorandum on the Report on Joint Standing&apos;Industrial Councils Issued by aSub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee.(War Cabinet 157 (12).)SliRTOUS difficulty must be anticipated with regard to the decision of the WarCabinet that the Ministry of Labour should circulate a report on Joint StandingIndustrial Councils to the leading Trade Unions aud Employers&apos; Associations, and alsoto the Commissioners on Industrial Unrest, with a view to ascertaining their general attitude to the proposed industrial councils at an early date. An enquiry has alreadybeen addressed to me by one of the Commissioners as to whether he was free to askquestions of witnesses bearing on the Report, or to submit to prospective witnesses acopy of the Report with a view to obtaining their considered opinions. To this enquiry 1 have, of course, replied in the negative.I should like to urge the following considerations in favour of a revision of theWar Cabinet decision :- -1. If the Report is circulated to the leading Unions and Employers&apos; Associations itat once loses its confidential character, and will become a general subject fordiscussion, but not for free discussion.2. This will give rise to complaints from the House of Commons that an importantState document like   the  Report   should have been circulated widelywithout their having the opportunity of reading it.3. It will give opponents of the scheme an opportunity of misrepresenting itbecause its precise nature will not be generally known.4. More important than any of these considerations is the fact that a great deal ofthe prevailing unrest arises from the belief that the Government is notdealing seriously with the labour question; and is not concerned about theposition of the working classes after the war.On the other hand, the argument against publication would appear to rest on theapprehension that the Report might be regarded as embodying the Governmentssettled policy, and as likely to give rise to controversy between Unions whose members
are skilled and those whose members are semi-skilled or unskilled. The first of these difficulties can, I think, be surmounted if the Report is published with a covering letter explaining that the Report does not embody the Governments settled policy.The second difficulty would not, I tb as the Report would necessarily be circulated to the Workers&apos; Unions and the National Union of General Labourers andother Unions not concerned with the engineering trades.. Consequently, thepublication of the Report would not give rise to the belief that it was intended solelyor mainly to deal with the difficult questions which will arise in the engineering industry after the war.In addition to the reasons given above in favour of publication, I feel very strongly that the issue of any document which showed that the Government was taking a real interest in the future of labour would have a most beneficial effect both at homeand with the armies in the field. On the other hand, if the Report is circulated inaccordance with the War Cabinet decision, but is not openly published, the scheme may be prejudiced through the misrepresentation and misunderslanding which is likely-to arise through garbled versions of the Report becoming current. Such a result would, I think, be deplorable, and I therefore feel justified in bringing the matter atonce to the notice of my colleagues. -G. N. B.June 19, 1917.o
