1. With, reference to War Cabinet 219, Minute 19, it was reported that difficulties were anticipated with the House ofLords with regard to amendments in the Corn Production bill which had been adopted by the Lords and rejected by the commons. If the two Houses failed to come at once to an amicable agreement there was some danger of the Bill being loston technical grounds of procedure.Lord Curzon and Mr. Bonar Law, in consultation with Mr. *Prothero, undertook to try to remove the outstandingobjections to certain proposed amendments in the Bill.2. The War Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first commissioner of Works, setting forth certain proposals of theNational War Museum Committee, and a memorandum on thescope of the Museum bv the Director-General, Sir MartinConway (Paper G.T.-1650).The Committee recommended that the original idea of a WarMuseum should be extended to embrace that of a National war memorial, with a Hall and Court of Honour, and other architectural-tectural features. Preliminary estimates for a suitable buildingshowed that a sum of 750,000Z. would be required to cover theexpenditure on the scheme. This would include provision for alibrary for books, pamphlets, newspapers, and other similarrecords connected with the war.Various suggestions for a site had been examined by theCommittee, and they recommended as most suitable a section ofHyde Park between the top of the Serpentine and BayswaterRoad.Lord Curzon pointed out the objections to the scheme. Hehad himself been one of the strongest supporters of a WarMuseum, but he had never contemplated a plan that would involvethe erection of a building or buildings, covering five acres of ground, and probably costing over one million sterling, in hyde park, that would apparently attempt to commemorate almost every incident and feature of a war which we have not yet Avonand which it was quite conceivable that in the future we mightdesire as far as possible to forget, and which would endeavour to combine with the collection and exhibition of interesting objects,arms, trophies, pictures and other memorials of the Avar, theerection of a great Memorial Hall in Avhich Avere to be inscribedthe names of the 400,000 to 500,000 British:, Colonials, and Indians,whose lives will haA^e been lost in the service of their countrjr.A museum Avas quite unsuited to become an Imperial war memorial. Different parts of the Empire and different localities in Great Britain AArould Avish to have their own memorials. Sinceunder the existing law copies of every book, newspaper andprinted publication were required to be. deposited in at least sixlibraries in the United Kingdom, it Avas quite unnecessary to occupy miles of shelves by making another collection here, or to convert the proposed museum into an annexe of the Record Office.A vast and heterogeneous collection of models or memorials even, as suggested, of munition workers, boy scouts, and girl guides, wouldin a few years&apos; time interest nobody and merely encumber space.A pledge had been given to the House of Commons by LordBeauchamp, when Chief Commissioner of Works, that no furtherbuilding, nor even a statue should be erected in any of the Londonparks without the consent of both Houses of Parliament, and a site had even been refused for a statue to the arctic explorer,Captain Scott. It was inconceivable therefore that the House ofCommons Avould giA^e sanction to such a sacrifice of park space as was now proposed.The entire scheme should be reduced to more manageableproportions, and should not attempt to do more than present a
22The Western 3. In continuation of &quot;War Cabinet 219, Minute 10, the ChiefFront. of the Imperial General Staff stated that the Germans had with-drawn two more divisions from the British battle front in flanders, making a total of twenty-four in all.In continuation of War Cabinet 219, Minute 15, the Chief ofthe Imperial Staff stated that the French had reached all their objectives on the east bank of the Meuse, in spite of the declaration to the contrary in the German communique. It was mentioned that no guns had been reported as taken, but the Chief of theImperial General Staff informed the Cabinet that probablyparticulars as to such captures would be forthcoming at a later date.The Italian Front. 4. In continuation of War Ccibinet 219, Minute 6, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff reported that the Northern and southern Italian Armies had both attacked; the former had onlyreached the first line trenches of the enemy, but the advance of thelatter had been very good, and had surmounted the obstacles whichhad previously held them up. In this connection the First sea lord stated that the monitors &quot; Earl of Peterborough &quot; and &quot; sir thomas Picton &quot; had bombarded enemy positions at Hermada onthe afternoon of the 19th instant with satisfactory results.Salonica. 5. With reference to the report of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff in War Cabinet 219, Minute 8, he informed the WarCabinet that he had received information that the french minister for War had telegraphed to General Sarrail directinghim to make immediate arrangements for taking over that portion[1365-221] B 2historical and pictorial (this should include models, as well aspictures, photographs, &amp;c.) memorial of the chief weapons,inventions and incidents of the war. If expanded in the manner proposed it would be an unjustifiable extravagance now and a white elephant in the future.The Secretary of State for War believed that the various parts of the United Kingdom would not be content with a memorial in London. Steps were in fact being taken to prepare for a National War Memorial in Scotland. In addition, townswill want their local memorials, and every museum will putforward claims for exhibits.The Secretary of State for India said that the House ofCommons had always been very sensitive to encroachments on public parks, and the proposal to use a site in Hyde Park wouldbe certain to meet with very strong opposition.It was also pointed out that it was very desirable to ascertain whether a suitable site was not available on the south side of the thames.The scheme was further criticised on the ground that it waspremature to identify the two ideas, and no building could be begun during the war.The War Cabinet decided To appoint the following Committee Mr. Walter Long (Chairman).Dr. Addison.Mr. Herbert Fisher.Mr. Munro.Mr. Duke.The Earl of Crawford and Balcarres.Sir Alfred Mond.To examine the proposals of the War Museum Committee andto report to the War Cabinet in due course.
of the Salonica front vacated by the division of British troops.In this connection the Minister of War sent for Colonel Spiers,and suggested that underground attacks were being made againstGeneral Sarrail, but Colonel Spiers had informed M. Painlevethat such was in no way the case, and that the difficulties general sarrail had to contend with as regards the front in the vicinity of Monastir were fully appreciated by the British authorities.The Eastern 6. With reference to War Cabinet 217, Minute 11, the ChiefFront. of the Imperial General Staff read to the War Cabinet a telegramhe had just received from General Barter, dated the 18th August,1917, in which it was mentioned that General Kornilofs fullconditions would not be communicated to the Russian government before the conference that was to be held at Moscow on the 25thAugust (New Style). General Barter added that GeneralKornilof was already putting in force disciplinary measures with-out reference to the Government, and proceeded to suggest that itmight be desirable that a high decoration should be bestowed onthe Commander-in-Chief of the Russian armies.The War Cabinet decided that At this stage it was not desirable to adopt the suggestion.The Recent Inter-Ally Conference.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff brought to thenotice of the War Cabinet that the Russian Commander-in-Chiefhad spoken to the British military attache as to the non-attendance of General Dessino at the Inter-Ally Conference, andhad been inclined to interpret it as a slight on the Russian army.The War Cabinet requested The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to express regret that General Dessino had not been invited to attend; topoint out that no slight of any kind was intended; andthat really the subjects under discussion were primarilypolitical matters which had been already dealt with inParis, when the Russian military representative hadbeen present.The Pope&apos;s Peace 8. With reference to War  Cabinet 220, Minute  1, theProposals. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs put forward, for the con-sideration of the War Cabinet, a draft reply to the Pope&apos;s peace proposals, to the effect that, until the enemy stated fully and clearly the terms under which they were prepared to negotiate for peace no further action on our part was possible.The War Cabinet decided that *It would be desirable to embody in the draft note the principleof &quot; restoration,&quot; and requested the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to show his draft note to theAmerican Ambassador and to the Counsellor to theFrench Ambassador, with the object of obtaining theirviews.Air Raid on 9. The First Sea Lord reported that four seaplanes hadBeirut, bombed the torpedo-sheds and storehouses on the piers at Beiruton the 17th instant, and had caused fires in the sheds. Nosubmarines were seen in the harbour. All the machines returned safely.
IllMiddelkerke 11- The First Sea Lord stated that a bombing raid had beenBombing Raid. carried out during the night of the 19th-20th on Middelkerkedump and the Burgeoise works, and that a further raid wasattempted on the morning of the 20th, but had to return owing tothe machines being attacked by enemy aircraft; our machines,however, returned safely.Attack on aZeppelin.Propaganda.12. The First Sea Lord reported that information had beenreceived that a light cruiser squadron, cruising in the vicinity ofJutland, had sighted a Zeppelin, and that an aeroplane had been dispatched from the deck of one of the light cruisers with a viewto attacking the same.

With reference to War Cabinet 220, Minute 2, the WarCabinet requested -Sir Edward Carson to assume general supervision overpropaganda as far as action in this country isconcerned.Recognition of claims fromOrganisationsoutside the CivilService.14. The War Cabinet had before them memoranda from theConciliation and Arbitration Board (Paper G.T. 1731), andfrom the Ministry of Labour (Paper G.T. 1732), dealing withthe question of the representation by the representatives of tradeunions of claims in respect of Government employees before theConciliation and Arbitration Board. The question was whether such Government employees were entitled to be represented beforethe Conciliation and Arbitration Board by the representatives oftrade unions, even though the said trade unions do not confine their membership to Government employees.The &quot;War Cabinet decided to approve such representation.Dr. Macnamara further raised the question of the right of access to the Committee on Production of industrial employees inthe various Government departments without the consent of thedepartment under whom the said employees may work. It waspointed out that the matter was already before a Committee of theWar Cabinet (Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes) (War Cabinet 191,Minute 5), and the War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Munitions and the Financial Secretary of theAdmiralty should confer, and forward the result of theirdeliberationsreferred to.to the War Cabinet Committee aboveWhitehall Gardens, S.
