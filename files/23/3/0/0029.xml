The War Cabinet agreed that a Committee, composed asfollows : The Prime Minister and Gener-al Smuts, in consultation withA representative of the Admiralty,A representative of the General Staff,A representative of the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces,and such other experts as they may desire,Major Storr (Secretary),should examine (1) the defensive arrangements for HomeDefence against air raids, and (2) the existing generalorganisation for the study and higher direction of aerialoperations.4. In reference to War Cabinet ISO, Minute 4, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that M. Painleve&apos;s visit hadbeen postponed.5. The War Cabinet approved a proposal by Mr. Barnes, thatan International Conference, to consider the arrangements for themaintenance and treatment of disabled soldiers, should be held inLondon, and authorised the British delegates at the PensionsConference now being held in Paris to issue an invitation. Mr. Barnesstated that the date at present contemplated for this conference was May 1918.Conveyance ofNurses.Prisoners of War.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration the subject ofthe convej^ance of nurses as passengers in hospital ships, brought forward by the Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-1329).While unwilling to sanction the conveyance of nurses to overseastheatres of war in hospital ships bearing the authorised distinguishingmarks, the War Cabinet decided that There was no objection to the conveyance of nurses in vesselsused as hospital ships, but not bearing the distinguishingmarks.7. The War Cabinet approved the agreement (Paper G.T.-1338)(Appendix I) negotiated by Lord Newton and the British repre-sentatives with German representatives at The Hague on thesubject of the treatment and exchange of combatant and civilianprisoners of war (War Cabinet 152, Minute 20). They decidedthat The Secretary, of. State jor...Foreign. Affairs should communicate this decision at once to the Dutch Government for theinformation of the German Government, and should invite
the former to ascertain whether the German government also approve the agreement.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was also asked toiiotify the Dutch Government, for the information of theGerman Government, that the Admiralty was prepared toallow Hull to be used (as notified to the War Cabinet bythe First Sea Lord) as the port for the embarkation anddisembarkation of prisoners.It was also decided that Pending the receipt of an official notification from the GermanGovernment as to their ratification of the agreement; no details should be made public, but that a statement shouldbe made in both Houses of Parliament to the effect thatan agreement had been reached.The War Cabinet directed  The Secretary to place on record their thanks to Lord Newtonand his colleagues for the success.of their negotiations.Submarines. 3. The First Sea Lord stated that the Special Service vessel&quot; Glen &quot; claimed to have sunk an enemy submarine.Air Paid on 9. The First Sea Lord reported that an aerial raid had beenConstantinople. carried out on Constantinople by an airman of the Royal Naval AirService in a Haadley-Page aeroplane. Eight 1124b. bombs hadbeen dropped on the i: Goeben &quot; and other ships in her neighbour-hood, and fires had been seen to break out. One bomb had been observed to fall on the German steamship &quot; General,&quot; in which theGerman Headquarters Staff was believed to be housed. Two bombs had also been dropped on the Turkish War Office.The Constructionof Mine-layers and merchant Ships inthe United Statesof America.10. The First Sea Lord stated that he had asked the UnitedStates Government to convert two interned German vessels, one at san francisco and the other at Baltimore, into mine-layers, which were urgently needed ; but it was a question of policy as to whether theWar Cabinet considered it more important that they should be used as cargo carriers, in view of the pressure we were putting upon theUnited States Government to increase their mercantile shipbuilding programme.   The War Cabinet decided that This matter should be arranged, if possible, by the First sea lord and the Shipping Controller, and the United StatesGovernment informed of their decision. If, however, theywere unable to reach an agreement, the question should again be brought before the War Cabinet.Proposed Agree-ment between the major entente powers regardingDefence AgainstMaritime Attack.11. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that he had.received further information from the naval attache in Washington,that the. United States Government would be willing to desist fromthe construction of capital ships and concentrate their naval shipbuild-ing capacity on the construction of small craft, if they were certain of being insured, so far as capital ships were concerned, against therisk of maritime attack after the war.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he hadalready taken steps to open up negotiations for an agreementbetween the Allied nations in regard to defence against maritime
attack, as authorised by the War Cabinet on the 3rd July. (WarCabinet 174, Minute 5.) He undertook to press the matter forward as rapidly as possible.a loss of H.M.S. 12. In reference to War Cabinet 180, Minute 12, the First Sea&quot;Vanguard.&quot; Lord reported that, of the crew of H.M.S. &quot;Vanguard,&quot; only 1officer and two men had been picked up, but the officer wasdying. Fortunately some officers and men had been absent on duty or leave, and the total of saved was approximately 22 officersand 50 men.13. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that he had as yet received no information, beyond the communique of the previous night, from the Field-Marshal Com-manding British Expeditionaiy Force in regard to the german attack on the British lines in the coast region of Flanders. He had,however, had a telephone message from Admiral Baeon. to the effectthat he understood that the enemy had captured the British first-line trenches. The two German Naval Divisions which had been operating in this region had recently been relieved by one ArmyDivision. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff regarded this attack on the part of the Germans as an effort to forestall our ownoperations.The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that certainemergency measures and precautions had been taken last night by theAdmiralty to guard against a landing by the enemy in rear of our line in Flanders.Russia. 14. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that in -the Stanislau region the Russians had broken through the enemyline to a depth of 7 miles over a front of 14 miles. The number ofprisoners taken during this attack amounted to 8,000, whilst 55guns had also been captured. The total number of prisoners takenby the Russians since the commencement of their offensive was26,000, with 84 guns.Arabia. 15. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived a report from a British officer to the effect that, in therecent operations carried out by King Hussein&apos;s force in Arabia, theTurks had lost 700 killed and 600 prisoners. The Arabs had occupiedAkaba, formerly in the possession of the Turks, and had destroyed the railway at many points over a considerable distance.16. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the subjectof certain grossly incorrect statements as to the comparative efforts of, and losses suffered by, the British and French respectively duringthe war, which had been made at a Secret Session of the FrenchSenate. From these statements it would appear that the British con-tribution to the war was not so great as that of the French.The injustice of this comparison, and the harmful effect it mighthave on the relations between the Allies, were obvious, but therewere certain difficulties in the way of directly contradicting thesemis-statements.The Prime Minister undertook to have a statement preparedshowing the total effort which had been made by the-&apos;, British Empire in regard to actual fighting, shipbuilding,manning the mercantile marine, not only for Great Britainbut for her Allies, more particularly France, as well as inany other directions in which British man-power of military age had been absorbed towards the common end.

17. With reference to the decision in War Cabinet 180,Minute 18, the Secretary of State for War reported to the WarCabinet that the Army Council were opposed to including in theTerms of Reference to the Court of Inquiry any direction as to suchCourt reporting on the conduct of any persons not subject to military discipline, and suggested that the War Cabinet should issue separateinstructions on that point.The view was expressed that the Army (Courts of Inquiry) act of 1916, though it authorised the Army Council to appoint civilians in certain cases (such as the matter under consideration) as membersof a Court of Inquiry, did not authorise the Army Council to call for a report from such a Court on the conduct of any persons not subject to military discipline -whose actions appeared to warrantcensure; neither would such a Court be under an obligation toreport on such persons.The precedent of the Barrett case was, however, quoted, inwhich in the Terms of Reference a general report was caUed for.The Attorney-General stated that, in presenting the case beforethe Court of Enquiry, he could, on behalf of the Government, request the Court to report on the actions of aU concerned, and he had nodoubt that the Court would comply with such a request.- The War Cabinet decided that The proposal of the Attorney-General should be adopted, and requested the Secretary of State for War to prepare thenecessary Terms of Reference to the Court of Inquiry,based on this assumption.The War Cabinet further directed, with reference to their decision of yesterday, that The term &quot; two Judges &quot; should be understood to mean &quot; two persons who hold or have held high judicial office.&quot;The War Cabinet then proceeded to consider their action as tothe forthcoming debate in Parliament.It was felt that their first step should be to make a statement ofthe case as it now stood, and to point out that, in view of the Courtof Enquiry ordered to be held, the conduct of individuals, otherthan those belonging to the Government, could not be discussedwhilst their case was sub judice, as it.was manifest^ unfair to havea debate on the acts of officers, &amp;c, and then hold a judicial enquiry on them. Further, that if the members of the Government eulogisedthe conduct of any officials, they would at once give an opportunityfor an attack on the same.If a debate was called for, it was considered that there wasample subject-matter for a discussion in connection with theadministration and the policy of the Government as regards India.In the course of the discussion, Mr. Balfour called attention tothe large amount of time which had been devoted by the &quot;WarCabinet, and by several of the Government Departments, to thisquestion, which, he suggested, was highly detrimental to the properconduct of the war.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 11, 1917.[1365-181] CThe mesopotamia commission:disciplinary action.question of the financial assistance given by this country would not he included.This information, when compiled, to be communicated toLieutenant-Colonel J.

As soon as practicable after capture every prisoner is to be enabled to informhis family of an address at which his family can communicate with him.The Hague, July 2, 1917.1. Civil Doctors of Medicine and Ministers of Religion.With regard to the repatriation of German civil doctors of medicine and ministers of religion now in British hands, the British delegates gave the foUowingdeclarations: The British Government cannot undertake to repatriate such persons if capturedafter the date of the relevant agreement, but will favourably consider the cases of all those whom they now hold.The German delegates declared that, as far as British civil doctors of medicineand ministers of religion are similarly detained in Germany, their cases will receivesimilar consideration.
2. Further Repatriation of Civilians and their Internment in -Neutral Countries.The delegates will recommend to their respective Governments to give theirbenevolent consideration to the question of the further repatriation of civilians, and tothe question of their further internment in neutral countries ; especially in the*cases ofthose detained in tropical climates or under other unfavourable conditions.3. Youthful Prisoners.General Friedrich declares that, subject to reciprocity, those British subjects whoare youthful and who are captives in German hands, shall be separated from the restof the prisoners of war and put in a separate block in one camp by themselves. they shall be kept away from all unfavourable influences to which they might be subjectedby being brought in contact with adult prisoners of war. Their further education and instruction shall also be provided for.4. More Speedy Trial of Combatant Prisoners of War.The British delegates having intimated that information has reached His Majesty&apos;sGovernment from time to time that the trial of prisoners of war in German campshas frequently only taken place after long delay and that the prisoners have in themeantime been kept in custody, General Friedrich informed the delegates that suchoccurrences were not in any way in order, and he stated that as soon as he returned to berlin he would expressly instruct the different commands to take such steps as would prevent the occurrence of similar delays in the future.The Hague, June 2S, 1917.5. Punishment of Prisoners of War, Remission of Punishments.(1.) The British delegates desire to represent to the German delegates the desira-bility of an agreement being concluded between them on the lines approximating as closely as possible to that arranged between the French and German Governmentswhereby all sentences inflicted for offences committed prior&apos;to the 1st September, 1916,were remitted until the conclusion of hostilities. An agreement on precisely similar lines is, however, owing to the limitations of disciplinary powers allowable under theBritish military code, impracticable.The British delegates therefore suggest that every combatant prisoner of war heldby either State, of whatever rank, shall, on a date to be agreed upon between theBritish and German Governments, be released from any form of imprisonment,detention, punishment, or restrictions, which may have been inflicted upon him for anycrime or offence whatever committed during his internment and prior to the dateagreed upon, and that the remainder of his punishment shall be remitted from thatdate. Any prisoner who benefits under this agreement will be exempt from any special restrictions other than those which are applicable to all prisoners of war, and will be equally eligible with them for all benefits they may enjoy, including repatriation andinternment in Switzerland.It has been a satisfaction to the British delegates to observe the favourable reception accorded, by the German delegates to this proposal at the meeting of the26th June. The British delegates were moved to make their proposal largely by,reason of the number of heavy sentences hitherto inflicted on many British prisoners in Germany far beyond any imposed for similar offences in England. These sentenceshave excited much feeling in England, and the delegates express the hope that theyare now things of the past.(2.) The British delegates assxime that all idea which the German delegates mayhave had that prisoners of war, whether combatant or civilian, who attempt to escape,,are subjected to additional penalties by reason of their falling into the hands of thecivil power, has been removed by the explanation given on the subject at the meetingof the 26th June.The Hague, June 30, 1917.The German delegates have heard with interest the declaration of the british delegates of the 28th June, from which it appears desirable that an understandingshould be arrived at on the subject of the remission of the punishments of British andGerman prisoners of war. They entirely agree with the view of the British delegates,and have willingly complied as far as possible in this direction with their proposals.
By the understanding thus reached the point seems to he settled in a satisfactorymanner.As far as concerns the punishment of German prisoners of war who have endeavour-voured to escape, the German delegates have no hesitation, after the explanation givenby the British delegates at the sitting of the 26th June, in confirming that thessuppo-sition expressed at the end of the declaration of the 2Sth June is correct.The Hague, July 2, 1917.6. Parcels.Various questions were raised relating to the delay which has taken place in the delivery of parcels, especially to prisoners in the labour camps throughout Germanyand in the occupied districts. This delay appears to be largely attributable to excessivecensorship, some parcels before reaching their destination having been censored asoften as three times.General Friedrich explained that the delays in the delivery of parcels at the campsin Germany and the strict censorship which is being exercised on parcels was due tothe discovery in many cases of articles of sabotage, which had been enclosed in parcelsaddressed to prisoners of war in Germany.General Friedrich further stated that the wishes of the British delegates hadalready been met to a certain extent, and the British delegates having stated that they saw great objection to such practices and strongly deprecated them, General Friedrichsuggested that the British Government should publish in the British and especially inthe neutral press a statement that the including of articles of sabotage in the parcelsaddressed to combatant and civilian prisoners of war is deprecated and disapproved bythe Government as being contrary to the interests of the whole body of prisoners ofwar, General Friedrich stating that he would simultaneously publish a correspondingdeclaration on behalf of the German Government.By these means it would be possible to give full satisfaction to the wishes of theBritish delegates.In order to give a guarantee for a corresponding action, General Friedrichproposes that both Governments communicate to each other the text of theirpublications. As soon as General Friedrich approves the British text, he willcommunicate to the British Government the text he proposes to publish for their approval. As soon as the two Governments have arrived at an agreement on the text of both announcements, as far as possible by telegram, the declaration shall be published by both sides on the same date agreed upon by telegram.General Friedrich then stated that he had given instructions before leavingGermany that parcels for prisoners in working camps were to be censored only at thosecamps, save in exceptional instances were no possibility of local censorship existed, inwhich cases the parcels would be censored at the parent camp before being sent totheir destination as far as possible undamaged. He added that as the result of his conversation with the British delegates this would be the practice in the future.General Friedrich also stated that these parcels were now delivered in the working-camps in occupied districts as freely as in the camps in Germany, and that in thesecamps the same privileges of correspondence would be permitted to the prisoners as inother camps. Special cases of excessive censorship, which would lead to the deterioration of the goods, would be enquired into and avoided as much as possible infuture.
