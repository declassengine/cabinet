IncreasedSliipbuildingProgramme:Reduction of ShellSteel.Steel in the UnitedStates of Americafor Prance.Priority for Platesand Sections.Use of LighterPlate Mills forThicker Plates.1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 180, Minute 19, the WarCabinet considered the report of Lord Curzon as to the increase inthe Shipbuilding Programme (Appendix).T. Material. &apos;    *(a.) It was stated that the existing monthly demand for shellsteel from France was 56,000 tons, and that a further supply of65,000 tons of mildsteel had been asked for.The Minister of Munitions stated that he was now assembliugall the demands for steel and comparing them with our resources,and hoped to be able in about a fortnight to present for theconsideration of the War Cabinet a general statement showing what&quot;cuts&quot; could be carried out with the minimum detriment to theconduct of the war. As far as the immediate proposal to feed the rolling mills was concerned, it would not encroach seriously onefficiency, provided that the supply of ore could be maintained.Mr. Churchill added that he had already given instructions that the rolling mills were to be fed to their full capacity.Mr. Hodge pointed out that a number of plate mills were not now fully employed, and he was convinced that, if there is a scarcity of plates, the steel workers, if provided with the pig-iron, would beprepared to work an extra ten hours a week to assist in meeting theAdmiralty requirements.The War Cabinet decided That the manufacture of shell steel for the French government by British firms and the manufacture of British shellshould be diminished as far as is necessary to obtain the steel required to feed the plate mills to their full capacity and the steel necessary for the appropriate quantity ofsections.(o.) As regards the reduction in the programme of shell steelfor France, it was pointed out that there was at the present moment in the United States of America 700,000 tons of steel belonging toFrance and paid for and only awaiting shipment.The WTar Cabinet decided that The Shipping Controller should go into the question of assisting the French in this matter, with a view to thus meeting the reductions in the shell steel, &amp;c, from this country toFrance, informing the French Government, as requisite,through the usual channel.(c.) The War Cabinet decided that In any case of shortage of steel at works engaged in makingshell steel as well as ships&apos; plates and sections, themanufacture of the plates and sections should have priority.(d.) The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that if authority was given for some of the lighter plate mills to roll ships&apos; plates in lieu of plates inch and under, he estimated that a matter of1,500 tons of ships&apos; plates could be provided weekly, Which,with theappropriate quantity of sections, represented roughly a ship of 5,000^deadwreight capacity each week.In view of the large demand for the thinner types of plates, itwas considered that it would not be economical to carry out thisproposal, and the War Cabinet decided To reconsider this change when dealing with the promisedreport of the Minister of Munitions referred to inparagraph (a).In the meantime, the Minister of Labour undertook to providethe Minister of Munitions with certain proposals for thefurther development of existing mills, both as regardsincrease of quantity and description of output,.
Temporary Cuttingof Supplies to departments, &amp;c.Extension of PlateMills.II. Labour.Stoppage ofShipyardRecruiting andCompleteProtection of theShipbuildingIndustry.(f/.) The First Lord urged that, inasmuch as the War cabinet had decided that steel for shipbuilding was to have priority, it followed that priority must be given to man-power for the building of the ships. &quot; The Admiralty had reduced the original demand formen needed for the three-million-ton programme from 120,000 to80,000, and they had also provided for an extended Naval programme without asking for more men. The present demand was for 25,000unskilled men. It was essential that the men obtained should be physically fit and capable of hard work. He proposed that an&quot; umbrella&quot; should be put over the shipyards, so as both to stopfurther recruiting from them and to attract men to them.The Secretary of State for War stated that the War Office waslamentably short of drafts for the Army, and if the proposals of theFirst Lord were conceded it would be impossible to maintain the divisions at the front at their proper strength. By agreement with lord Milner, the War Office had already arranged not to take menfrom the shipyards, who were there before the 29th March. Thepresent proposals tore up that agreement, and turned the shipyardsinto a refuge for all in munitions and other similar works who wished to escape service with the Colours. Lord Derby added thathe would be prepared to extend the date from the 29th March tothe 1st June, or even to the 15th July, but to leave the date quiteindefinite Avas to strike at the whole recruiting system.The Minister of Munitions pointed out that to place the ship-yards in a specially favoured position would.certainly have the effectof drawing men from munition works, and he did not think it waspossible to decide the question at issue without first surveying thewhole problem of material and man-power. He also observedthat a Committee of the Cabinet was at present dealing with the(e.) The First Lord asked that, as a temporary measure for amatter of six weeks, the supplies of plates to Departments, Franceand Italy, should be reduced so as to render available each week1,000 tons of ships&apos; plates. By such action the men now in the yards could be kept fully employed until the increased supply wasforthcoming as the result of getting the maximum output from the mills.As regards supplies to France, the Minister of Munitions statedthat he had seen M. Thomas, who had made greatly increased demands and had strongly urged that no reduction should, for thepresent, be made as regards that country, and Mr. Churchill had agreed not to cut down such supplies of plate until after his proposalsreferred to in paragraph (a) had been considered by the War Cabinet.In connection with the supply of plates to Italy during the next six weeks, it was pointed out that if the plates destined for thatcountry were put into ships building in the United Kingdom, quickerresults might be anticipated; and, moreover, such action did not involve the risk of the plates being lest whilst en route by sea.The War Cabinet decided That, during the next six weeks, the other Departments of theGovernment should have their requirements of plates overj inch cut down, and that the supplies of steel plates toItaly should, for the same period, be suspended, such platesbeing allocated to shipbuilding.(/.) The War Cabinet decided that Priority should be given to the extension of existing plate mills and to such new mills including one at Appleby as arein contemplation.
general question of Man-Power, and that a decision could more readily be arrived at after it had reported.The Director of Recruiting contended that to put an &quot; umbrella &quot;over the shipyards in the way proposed would seriously disturb theworking of the Tribunals and Colliery Recruiting Courts, as men,whose exemptions were cancelled by these bodies, would immediatelytransfer themselves to the yards and automatically obtain freshexemption. It would be possible to obtain the desired labour by various administrative devices, and especially by drawing on some ofthe colliery districts. The Admiralty were not in a position to absorb at once all the men asked for, and the transfer to the ship-- yards could be graduated to suit the increase in the supply of steel.The War Cabinet decided that 1.) All recruitment or withdrawal of labour from the shipyardsfor the Army should cease so far as concerns all men in the shipyards before the 1-5th July, as against the 29th March,which is at present the operative date ;(2.) While the Cabinet are unable at present to agree to makingshipbuilding a fully-protected industry, the RecruitingDepartment shall as an emergency measure do what itcan, by administrative co-operation, to furnish the menneeded for carrying out the shipbuilding programme.(3.) In view of the agreed necessity to maintain a full supplyof labour for shipbuilding the First Lord should reportlater to the Cabinet on the position, and the detailedpolicy should be settled in the light of a report on Man-Power, to be made by the Cabinet Committee consideringthe question.Release of skilled men from theArmy.(h.) Lord Curzon reported that, in order to take full advantageof the rolling capacity of this country, it was necessary that skilledsteel and blast-furnace workers should be released from the Army.A list had been drawn up by the Ministry of Munitions of 823 ofthese, and Lord Curzon recommended their immediate release.Lord Derby undertook to do all he could to facilitate the releaseof these skilled men.Eelease of MarineEngineers andFitters.(i.) The War Cabinet next considered Lord Curzon&apos;s recom-mendation that all marine engineers and fitters who are at presentemployed by the Ministry of Munitions should be released and trans-ferred to the Admiralty, so as to avoid serious delay in the provisionof marine engineers for merchant ships.The Ministry of Munitions pointed out that, so far, it had beenfound impossible to extend dilution over the whole area of Govern-ment work, and that there was a very heavy demand on the ministry for engineers and fitters to provide aircraft, tanks, agriculturaltractors, &amp;c. ; nor was the Ministry in a position to enforce thereturn of the men asked for to the Admiralty. The problem was really how, after satisfying the irreducible minimum demands ofeach Department, to allocate the transferable margin of labour abovethe minimum.The War Cabinet decided that The Admiralty should put forward their requirements underthis head periodically to the Ministry of Munitions, Avhoshould release as many men as they possibly could ; theDepartments to confer in cases of difficulty.Eelease of ShipyardWorkers in theArmy.(j.) The Secretary of State for War stated that the War office had already released over 6,000 skilled shipyard workers from theArmy, and he was prepared to continue to do so.
(k.) The First Lord stated that he could use 5,000 prisonersof war at once, and 5,000 more later on, on yards for merchantship building. The Secretary of State for War agreed to ask Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to select as many suitable prisonersas he could for this purpose.(I.) The Ministry of Labour undertook to make a special effort to obtain 5,000 men from the building trades for the newshipyards. *(m.) Lord Curzon recommended that when the Ministry ofLabour had carried out the above, recourse should be had to theDirector of National Service, who had expressed his willingness tohelp.The War Cabinet took note of Mr. Chamber lams representa-tions on this head, viz., that, while his Department might be ableto render effective assistance at the present time, he could not guarantee to find the men if the demands were made upon himseveral months hence. *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 9, 1917.Use of Prisonersof War.Men fromBuilding Trades.National ServiceVolunteers.* These two decisions have been suspended by direction of the Prime Ministerpending1 the appointment of the new Director-General of National Service.C[1365-209]
APPENDIX.G.T.-1600.Increased Shipbuilding Programme. tReport by Lord Curzon.THIS Committee was appointed by a decision of the War Cabinet (W.C. 180,Minute 1 9) to examine into the steps that should be taken as regards the supply bothof steel and labour, and carry into effect the programme of increased merchant-shipbuilding up to a total of 3,100,000 tons per annum, that was submitted to the WarCabinet by Sir E. Geddes and approved in principle by them. The Committee has heldseveral sittings, at which the representatives of the various Departments concernedattended and stated their case. In order that the War Cabinet may be seized of thesituation and may give the requisite authority for carrying out their instructions on points where there is not complete agreement between the Departments, I havedecided to submit this interim report to the War Cabinet, whose early decision issolicited.I. Material.The present output of finished steel, exclusive of shell discard quality, is about140,140 tons per week.The main purposes for which this supply is used are: Tons per Week.For making shell and shell parts for British ..,, ,, ,,       Allies  ..War Office, including Railways,   &quot; Tanks.&quot; TrenchMechanical Transport, and General PurposesAdmiralty (including auxiliary craft)Mercantile MarineConstruction workGuns   .. ..&apos;        ..AircraftRailway maintenanceWheels and tyresLocomotivesExport (other than shell steel)WarfareI.W.T.,32,45510,95512,90814,03214,3574,0353,6251,0162,7679626348,130The present supply of steel to merchant shipbuilding is sufficient to afford about13,000 tons per week for the hulls of vessels, and would give, roughly speaking, an output of 1,350,000 tons gross of shipping per annum.- An increase of 5,000 tons of ships&apos; plates and 2,500 tons of sections per week would augment the output to 2,050,000 tons gross. Owing, however, to the limitedplate-rolling capacity in this country, there are involved in getting even this restrictedincrease in shipbuilding certain readjustments, including the cutting down, to someextent, of the supply of shell steel, both to ourselves and to France.A further increase of 1,500 tons of ships&apos; plates per week can be obtained byrolling smaller and thicker plates in the light mills, which at present roll thin sheets.This would bring the output of shipping up to 2,200,000 tons gross per annum.Certain extensions of steel works are now in progress, but they will yield no resultbefore the end of the year, nor their full increase before July 1918. These will go aconsiderable way in helping to reach an output of 3,000,000 tons gross of shipping.In the meantime until the adjustments suggested above have had full effect 1,000 tons per week can be released for shipbuilding by a temporary reduction of our steel export to Franco and Italy and by cutting down slightly the supply of plates to other government services, but not so as to affect in any way the supply for guns, aircraft,locomotives, or agriculture. Accordingly, in view of the urgent necessity of the case propose that the following steps bt; taken (I.) That the manufacture of shell steel for the French Government by british firms and the manufacture of British shell be diminished so far as isnecessary to obtain the 5,000 tons of steel required to feed the plate millsto their full capacity.
(2.) That the cutting down of the manufacture of shell steel for France in thiscountry should, as far as possible, be compensated by the supply of tonnage to carry French shell steel from the United States of America to France,the Shipping Controller being instructed in this sense.(3.) That, in any case of shortage of steel at works engaged in making shell steel,as well as ships&apos; plates and sections, the manufacture of the plates and sections should have priority.(4.) That, where the lighter plate-mills can roll plates capable of being used for ship building purposes, this should be done in preference to rolling thinsheets.(5.) That, during the next six weeks, the other Departments of the Governmentshould have their requirements of plates over J inch cut down, and thatthe supplies of steel plates to France and Italy should, for ths same period,be suspended, with the effect of releasing 1,000 tons of plates per week for ship building.(6.) Priority should be given to the extension of existing plate mills and to suchnew mills as are in contemplation.When the Minister of Munitions has had an opportunity of surveying the whole situation and of preparing further proposals, the situation can again be reviewed. Inthe meantime, it is hoped that the carrying out of these recommendations will not causeany insuperable difficulty to the services affected.II. Labour.To produce the amount of tonnage above referred to, it is plain that a considerableamount of extra labour will be required. For this purpose immediate steps arenecessary: (1.) The first step that I would recommend is that all recruitment or withdrawalof labour from the shipyards for the Army should cease. At the presentmoment all men -who joined munitions after the 29th March, 1917, and arenot in the schedule of Protected Occupations, are being recruited.(2.) If full advantage is to be taken of the rolling capacity of this country it isnecessary that skilled steel and blast furnace workers should be released from the Army. A list has been drawn up by the Ministry of munitions of 823 of these, and I recommend their immediate release, which theSecretary of State for War has indicated his willingness to consider.(3.) The Admiralty has expressed the opinion that, unless shipbuilding be made a fully protected industry, the requisite number of men will not be iorthcoming.The Secretary of State for War will explain his views to the War Cabineton this subject.(4.) All marine engineers and fitters who are at present employed by the Ministryof Munitions shoidd be released and transferred to the Admiralty, otherwiseserious delay will take place re the provision of marine engines for merchant ships.(&quot;.) Shipyard workers in the Army should be released in order to provide a nucleus of skilled labour for new yards.(6.) The War (Jilice has &apos;promised to help with regard to the loan of prisonersof war.(7.) The Minister of Labour undertook to make a special effort&apos;to obtain as manybuilders as possible for the new shipyards, and will endeavour to secure.r:,000 men by this process.(8.) When this effort has been made recourse may be had to the Director-Generalof Nation! Service, who has expressed his willingness to help.f (Initialled) C.August 3, 1917.
