Position of the 1. THE President of the Board of Trade explained that recently,Cotton Industry. owing to the rising prices of cotton and the inadequate supply coming forward, a Cotton Control Board had been set up to deal with thesituation. The Board was thoroughly representative of all the-interests involved, and it had put forward a scheme for regulating the consumption of cotton, and for supporting the operatives whowould be thrown out of work in consequence.The main features of the position have been set forth in amemorandum prepared by the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-1638),and were briefly summarised as follows by Sir Albert Stanley : The shortage of stocks is particularly serious in connectionwith American cotton rather than with Egyptian cotton. DifHcul-ties with the latter may develop later, but for the moment they maybe neglected.The reserve or margin on which the industry works is at presentreduced to about three weeks&apos; supply at Liverpool as against ten weeks&apos; supply this time last year, whilst there are, in addition, about four weeks&apos; supply at the mills, or almost certainly less than theamount usually held at the mills. The consumption of the industryis estimated at about 55,000 tons per month, or 55,000 bales perweek. The Shipping Controller had informed the Board of trade that he hoped to be able to ship 70,000 tons of cotton (or, say,300,000 bales) in August, and 50,000 tons (or 220,000 bales) inSeptember, but that he was doubtful about being able to main-tain even the level required to supply the mills on the reducedmanufacturing basis proposed by the Control Board. The Board&apos;proposal was to reduce compulsorily the consumption of cotton at the mills to a 60&apos;per cent, basis of-the total spindlage. Spinners andweavers of Egyptian cotton would be licensed to exceed the 60 percent, and so also would those engaged in Government contracts.Owing to labour shortage the mills have already been reduced by18 per cent, of their total spindlage. It is proposed that, instead of putting all the mills on short time, the operatives affected by this further reduction should be thrown entirely out of work, and that eachidle man should receive approximately 25s. a week, and each idlewoman 15s. a week, as out-of-work benefit, from a fund to be administered by the Trade Unions. This fund would be con-stituted&apos; by a levy on employers licensed to work their millsabove the 60 per cent, standard. It is roughly estimated thatsome 10,000 men and 20,000 women will be thrown on the fund.The Control Board believe that the fund will prove adequate to thedemands made upon it, but could not guarantee that would be so. Itwas proposed to try the above plan for three months, and then to review the situation in the light of the cotton stocks. Should theposition have become materially worse than&apos; at present, otherdependent trades would be affected and larger numbers would becomeunemployed.Sir David Shackleton, in reply to a suggestion, pointed out that, the spinners and weavers were a highly specialised class, accustomed to work in a humid atmosphere of a high temperature, and werenot suitable for quick adaptation to open-air work on the land, orheavy work in shipyards. Further, the demand for women workerswas falling off in some of the munition areas.It was ut-ged, in the course of the discussion, that the AmericanGovernment should be pressed to assist in conveying cotton to thiscountry to the extent of the 40 per cent, which we were likely toleave behind in the States. It appeared, however, that the Americancrop this year is not large, that the Americans themselves absorb55 per cent, of the crop, and that Japan was a large buyer.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the scheme of the Cotton Control Board as recommended by the Board of Trade.
Eailway Labour 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the unrest. Board of Trade on Railway Unrest (Paper G.T.-1637), and theposition was fully explained by Sir Albert Stanley. The associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, by demanding an eight-hour day, were breaking the truce which had been concludedon the outbreak of war. This Union represented about 35,000 men,or about one-half of the drivers and firemen employed on the rail-ways. The leaders of the Union wished to take advantage of allthe railways being under one^ management to secure the adoption ofthe principle of an eight-hour day, but they did not wish to alter the schedules of working time until after the war. On the otherhand, to concede the principle now would involve the payment of overtime on au eight-hour basis. This would have to be extendedto all grades of railwaymen, and would cost the State about10,000,OOOZ. per annum over and above the very substantial increases of wage and overtime pay, amounting to 25,O00,000Z.per annum, whicii had already been conceded by the railway executive.The National Union of Railwaymen, which was much thelarger organisation, was not putting forward the demand for an eight-hour day.Sir Albert Stanley strongly advised the War Cabinet to resist the demand of the Engineers and Firemen&apos;s Union.The Minister of Labour supported the President of the Boardof Trade, and did not think the threatened strike would last a fortnight, as public opinion would be united against it.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the President of the Board of Trade to refuse thedemand of the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen for an eight-hour day.Inter-Ally 3. With reference to War Cabinet 198, Minute 12, and war transport Cabinet 204, Minute 11, the War Cabinet had before them a letterConference. from the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-1636), in whichhe pointed out&apos; that, owing to pressure of work, he had not sufficient time to undertake the duties of Chairman of the proposed conference.The Shipping Controller stated that, in his opinion, it was undesirable for any Transport Conference to be held.It was pointed out, however, that the Italian delegates to theConference have already arrived in London, and have asked for an interview with the Prime Minister. Perhaps, instead of a Conference,they might be satisfied with a meeting at the Admiralty on thesubject of designs of vessels.The War Cabinet asked The Shipping Controller to deal with the matter, and, ifpossible, to prevent the representatives of the other Alliesfrom coming to London.[1365-208J(b.) To request the Board of Trade and the Ministry of labour to see what measures could be taken to organise suitablealternative employment for the cotton operatives whowould be thrown out of work under the scheme.(c.) To request the Shipping Controller to endeavour to securethe co-operation of the American Government in thetransport of cotton in American ships, and to do his utmost to build up the cotton stocks in this country.
Restriction of 4. The President of the Board of Trade informed the WarImports. Cabinet that M. Clementel was again asking for a &quot;modification ofthe restriction of importation of French goods into this country.In   this  connection  the Foreign  Office   were also  pressing thatconcessions should be made to the French.The War Cabinet asked  *Lord Curzon to confer with Lord Robert Cecil and Sir albert stanley on the subject, subsequently to see M. Clementel,and report to the War Cabinet.M. Tardieu&apos;sLetter.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff called the attentionof the War Cabinet to a letter of the 7th August, written byM. Tardieu, the French representative in the United States ofAmerica. The letter was inaccurate and of a mischief-makingnature; it stated that, whereas there were forty-two german divisions opposite the English, there were eighty-one opposite theFrench, but gave no qualifying explanation of the circumstances. Itfurther described France as the &quot; country which to-day, as well as during the last - three years, bears principal exertion of ourdreadful foe.&quot;The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should take immediate action to prevent, if possible, the letter being published in the United States of America by telegram to Washington, and by seeing the French ChargedAffaires.(6.) The Secretary of State for War should provide the Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs with the material fora reasoned refutation.Russia.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read GeneralBarter&apos;s telegram No. 1180 giving General KornilofFs conditions of accepting his appointment, namely, that he should be responsible tolegal Government only and not to any Committee ; that the appli-cation of disciplinary measures and death penalty should beextended to all troops in the Empire : that sanction should be givento inflict death penalty on commanders who do not repress lack of discipline with sufficient energy. These conditions had been acceptedby the Government.General BarteFs telegram further indicated certain improvements in the moral of the Russian forces. Some troops in retreat had cometo a halt, and some had even resumed the offensive. It was hopedthat the 11th Army would be in a position to resume a partialoffensive in a month&apos;s time.Russian Troops inFrance.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theRussian troops in France, to the number of about 8,000 to 10,000,had mutinied. They had been surrounded by French troops; partof them had surrendered, and part were being starved intosubmission.Germans GatheringHarvests in russian Retreat.S. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGermans were gathering harvests in valleys from which the russians had retreated. A message had been sent urging the Russians toburn their crops in the event of any further retreat.
East Africa.10. The War Cabinet had under consideration a telegram fromLieutenant-General van Deventer, of the 6th August, giving an account of the Lindi action, during which an Indian regiment, the30th Punjabis, had lost about 250 killed and missing, including all their British officers.It was felt that more information was desirable.The War Cabinet therefore requested The   Chief of the Imperial General   Staff  to   askvan Deventer to forward any further particulars.GeneralLabour Disputes. H, The War Cabinet had before them a Minute by lord milner and Mr. Barnes (Paper G.T.-1608), suggesting that theterms of their reference should be widened, and that they shouldbe instructed to hold a conference of representatives of all the interested parties, with a view to bringing up a general report to theCabinet.The War Cabinet decided that The terms of reference should be widened, as suggested.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 9, 1917.oGold for Eussia. 9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theRussian troops in Asia were in great&apos; need of English or Persiangold for the purchases of horses and pack animals.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported a similarmessage from Sir C. Marling.The amount of gold asked for by Prussian Headquarters was180,000 sovereigns now, and 92,000 sovereigns per month afterwards.The War Cabinet asked The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and the Secretary of State for War toconfer on the subject and see what could be done in thematter.
