The Air Raid:Views of theField-marshal commanding-in-Chief,Home Forces.1. IN continuation of their discussion on the previous Saturdayafternoon (War Cabinet 178), the War Cabinet considered the air raid on the 7th July, 1917, in further detail.The Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, readtwo letters which he had written regarding the withdrawal ofthe two squadrons of fighting aeroplanes, one letter dated the 2ndJuly and addressed to the Secretary to the War Office (Appendix I),the other dated the oth July, addressed to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, in reply to a letter and memorandum dated the5th July (Appendix II). In his letters Lord French had made itclear that, in the absence of these machines, the air forces at his disposal were not adequate to 111661 clll attack on London.The War Cabinet commented severely and adversely on thefact that the letter of the 2nd July had not been brought to their attention, particularly as the Cabinet Committee on War Policy had discussed the matter very fully with Field-Marshal Sir douglas haig and General Trenchard, the latter of whom had been speciallybrought to this country for the purpose. - -On enqrury it became clear that Lord Frenches letter of the2nd instant had not been seen by the Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of the War Office pointed out that this letter had arrived on the evening of the 2nd instant, and, after beingregistered, had been sent at once by special messenger to theDirector-General of Military Aeronautics. This action had beentaken as a matter of urgency in consequence of paragraph 4 of thesaid letter, which asked that the considerations brought to notice inthe earlier part of the letter might be taken into account in the monthly distribution of aeroplanes, which wordd be made thefollowing day. In the ordinary course of events the letter, being of extreme urgency, would not be held back, though of greatimportance, for the personal information of the Secretary of Statefor War, and would be sent to the head of the Department concerned,through whom it would reach the Secretary of State, if necessary.General Sir David Henderson stated that he had received aC0Py 01 the letter on the 2nd instant from General Shaw, and hadimmediately taken departmental action in regard to paragraph 4.It was not clear, however, whether the letter had reached thedepartment of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff or not, and itwas left to General Henderson to enquire fully into the matter andreport to the War Cabinet.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who is the constitutionaladviser to the Government on questions of military policy, statedthat if the letter had been brought to his notice he&apos;would have brought the matter to the attention of the War Cabinet.System of intelligence.2. The first news of the approach of raiders was given at  &quot;20 a.m. The system of information in regard to hostile air raidswas described to the satisfaction of the War Cabinet.The Machines 3. The machines at the disposal of the Field-Marshal Corn-available. manding-in-Chief, Home Forces, on the occasion of the air raid, andwhich actually ascended, were given by General Sir David Hendersonas 79, but some of these were late in reaching the scene. Thenumber given by General Shaw was 55, which included a numberof inferior machines. The actual number of first-class fighting&apos; machines which went up from those at the disposal of the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, was 15, composed asfollows : 8 Sopwith Scouts.3 S.E. 5&apos;s.4 De Haviland 4&apos;s.
3WO 179Anti-aircraftArtillery.The Enemy&apos;sLosses.Future Develop-ment of AerialEngines.21 additional first-class fighting machines from other Royal FlyingCorps sources also took part in the operations. The number of machines sent up by the Royal Naval Air Service was 33 altogether,4. General Shaw reported that the enemy had never comebelow a height of 12,500 feet. This information had been cheekedby the artillery obsetwers, the height-finders, and the airmen&apos;sreports. The general belief that the enemy aeroplanes were at amuch lower altitude was due to the great size of the Gotha machines,which have three times the spread of wing of our Sopwith Scouts.All reports, he said, agreed that the gunnery had been good.5. In regard to the damage inflicted on the enemy, GeneralShaw and Commodore Paine confirmed the official statement that four of the raiders had been destroyed. The machine claimed bythe Royal Flying Corps had been seen sinking in the water with three men on board. Two of the three machines destroyed by theRoyal Naval Air Service had also been observed to sink, whileanother had been driven down in flames. Apart from these fourraiders destroyed, the machines of the Royal Naval Air Service from dunkirk had destroyed or driven down seven enemy aeroplanes orseaplanes, so that a total of eleven hostile machines could fairly be claimed as the result of the raid.General Henderson pointed out in this connection that one reason why the losses inflicted were not greater was that our machines arrived, to a large extent, singly or in small groups, andit was difficult for these to attack a number of enemy machines information. In addition, it had to be remembered that there was always a number of indecisive combats on these occasions. It was believed that the casualties among pilots and observers in the enemy machines had been considerable, as many bullets had been seen to strike the fusilage ; but each machine carried three airmen, and wasfitted with double engines, with a dual control. Probably ourairmen would have been better advised to aim at the engines, andnot at the pilots.6. As a measure of expansion in aerial output in this country,Sir William Weir gave the following figures and estimates of theoutput of aero engines : From Manston, 9 machines.From Eastchurch, 2 machines.From Dunkirk, 22 machines.Realised.Estimated.1916.*1917.1917.1918.january february march ..April   ..May    ..June   - .July    . .AugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember8217892,5003,100491778l,133t9405875025646921,2001,4601,6502,0002,2502,3004,000* The delivery figures for 1916 are not quite accurate, owing to doubts as to thenumbers delivered to the British Flying Services from French sources,f Five weeks.
He pointed out that since this time last year there had been agreat technical development of aircraft, resulting in higher horse-power for fighting machines (owing, as Commodore Paine explained,to the need for fighting machines with a speed of 110 to 1*15 milesper hour as compared with 82 to 85 miles per hour for a similarmachine a year ago), and although every effort was being made to achieve simplification of type, there had been in some cases greatertechnical complication.The Secretary of State for War reported that, in his opinion,sufficient personnel could be obtained to keep pace with theestimated expansion of output (War Cabinet 173, Minute 25), andthat the principal difficulty would be the provision of aerodromes.Views of theField-marshal commanding-in-Chief, France.7. In reference to the decision taken at the meeting of the WarCabinet on the 7th July, the Secretary of State for War read atelegram, No. O.B. 1837, dated the 7th July, from Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig, protesting against the proposed withdrawal oftwo squadrons of aeroplanes from France, owing to the great con-centration of enemy lighting machines which was being carried outon the British front.Reprisals.8. In regard to the question of reprisals, the Secretary of Statefor War stated that he had telegraphed to ascertain whether theFrench intended to continue their raids as reprisals.Commodore Paine pointed out that we had given the Frenchfifty machines for carrying out such raids.Attention was also drawn to the fact that the Royal Naval AirService is incessantly bombarding such places as Bruges, Zeebrugge,and enemy aerodromes in Belgium by day and night.Conclusion.9. The War Cabinet recognised that public against hostile aircraft attack the protection of theis a matter of increasing-importance, particularly in the present state of the war, when theissue depends almost as much on ,the endurance of the peoples as onthat of the armies. Nevertheless, in view of the immediate andcritical importance of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haigs demands,and in conformity with the advice of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, the War Cabinet decided that (a.) Only one Fighting Squadron instead of two, as decided onthe 7th instant, should be recalled. (War Cabinet 178,Minute 1 (ii).In reaching this decision they took special note ofLord French&apos;s protest that one squadron was only halfwhat he required.    (War Cabinet 178, Minute 1 (iii).(o.) That the proposal to raid Mannheim should be abandonedfor the present.Secret Sessiorft 10. In view of the fact that a large number of questions weredown for answer in the House of Commons in regard to the air raid, and in consequence of the impossibility of giving reasonablycomplete and frank replies without revealing matters which, inthe public interest, must be kept secret, the War Cabinet decidedthat Parliament should be asked to meet in Secret Session for a discussion of the question.The Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, theDirector-General of Military Aeronautics, and the FifthSea Lord, undertook to furnish at once to the Prime
Minister full accounts of the Raid, of the various engage-in ents, and the enemy losses, so far as their respectiveinformation went.11. The Secretary reported that he had received a letter fromthe Chief Officer of the London Fire Brigade, containing certain proposals for improving the fire-extinguishing arrangements inLondon in the event of air raids.The Secretary said that he had seen the Chief Officer on theprevious clay, who had made some interesting observations inregard to the localities selected by the enemy for their attacks.Commander Sladen had pointed out that the warehouses withinthe City of London contained probably an aggregate greater wealththan that concentrated in any area of corresponding size in theworld. Also, owing to the narrow streets, fires within this area were very difficult to deal with. The Germans would haveknowledge of these facts from information interchanged betweenthe heads of the Fire Brigades of the two countries before the war.Another densely crowded area which Commander Sladen had considered particularly liable to attack was Soho. AlthoughCommander Sladen had by no means excluded the probability of anattack on the Government offices, he had pointed out that if the mapof London is examined it will be found that the prospects of damage from bombs dropped among the Government offices woidd be much less than in the City, owing to the width of the streets in the WestEnd, the existence of the river and St. James&apos;s Park, and the much less inflammable contents of the buildings.The letter from the Chief Officer of the Fire Brigade hadcontained three proposals (a.) That a certain number of men should be returned fromthe Navy and the Army to the Fire Brigade.The   Secretary   reported   that   he  had   alreadyforwarded this proposal to the First Lord of the admiralty and Secretary of State for War respectively.(6.) That additional demolition sections of Royal Engineersshould be made available.The Secretary reported that he had communicatedthis proposal to the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief,Home Forces.(c.) That the organisation of the Fire Brigades lying withinthe Metropolitan Police area, but outside the LondonCounty Council area, should be arranged wuth a view totheir utilisation as a reserve for the London fire brigade.This proposal, the Secretary stated, he had already-communicated to the - Home Secretary, and had proposed a conference.The War Cabinet approved the action taken by the Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 9, 1917.179]C
APPENDIX I...... General Headquarters,Home Forces,H.F.C.R. 13217 (A.A.) Horse Guards,Sir, London, S.W. 1, July 2, 1917.IT is. understood that the two squadrons Royal Flying Corps which haverecently been at my disposal for Home Defence will be withdrawn on the 5th instant.2. Although the number of machines and pilots available for day defence havebeen to some extent increased during the past few weeks, the withdrawal of these squadrons will leave the means at my. disposal to repel aeroplane attacks dangerouslyweak, and it cannot be supposed that the danger of attack can be any the less afterthe 5th instant than it is now or has been in the past. In fact, it is probably muchgreater ; for, as far as is known, this new type of enemy machine is now being produced -in considerable numbers. Further, there is a reasonable probability thatthe enemy may send fast machines to create alarm on the coast and induce us to putour machines into the air, following them with a strong attack of large &quot; Gotha &quot;aeroplanes.3. If this is the case, the main attack may take place when our machines havebeen some time in the air and are short of petrol.The only means of meeting such tactics is to have such a force of aeroplanesavailable as will not necessitate the putting up of all our available force at once.4. It is understood that the monthly allotment of machines will be madeto-morrow, and I trust that the claims of Home Defence may receive. particularconsideration inthe light of what I have stated above.5. Moreover, the number of machines placed at my disposal from sources otherthan the Home Defence squadrons is a diminishing quantity. There are no machinesto-day available at Hendon, nor have there been for some days past, and the twoaeroplanes which it was arranged should always be kept at Lympne are nowrepresented by one machine of indifferent value.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) FRENCH, Field-Marshal,Commanding-in-Ghief, Home Forces.The Secretary, War Office.APPENDIX II.General Headquarters,Home Forces,Horse Guards,H.F.C.R. 5764 (A.A.) London, 8.W. 1., July 6, 1917.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,War Office,WITH reference to your memorandum No. 79/9710, dated the 5th July, 1917.The two squadrons recently placed under my orders have now been withdrawn.Apart from the slower machines&apos;which have neither the climbing power nor speedsufficient to make them effective against such machines as the enemy may be expectedto employ, the means at my disposal to repel aeroplane attacks are as follows : 12 Sopwith Scouts.3 S.E. 5.6 D.H. 4.Total     21In addition there are two war aeroplanes at Lympne, but because of the distancethese are not immediately available for the defence of London.I desire to place on record my most emphatic opinion that even with the additionof 12 Sopwith Scouts, which it is hoped will be available by the -lothr instant, the
aeroplanes which I can dispose of are not sufficient for effective action against raids inforce.Such raids may certainly he expected, and if London is again subjected to attack the results may be disastrous.The situation, as I have stated here is quite clear ; at the same time if you desireto discuss the question personally I shall be glad to see you here.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) FRENCH, Field-Marshal,Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces.
