Mesopotamia 1. WITH   reference   to   War   Cabinet   182, Minute   1, theCommission: Secretary of State for War reported that the Army Council hadDisciplinary considered the War Gabinetfs view as set forth in the amendedActl0n- Terms of Reference shown therein, and were prepared to issue orders in that sense, provided that the Prime Minister addressed aletter to the Army Council requesting them to add in the Terms ofReference the fact that a report was to be made on persons not subject to Military Law. Lord Derby stated that this proposal wasmade after consultation with the Attorney-General and the Judge-Advocate-General, and that tbe reason for putting forward this request was that the Army Council did not like to arrogate to themselves powers in connection with the trial of civilians, and thatthey required the letter for their own protection in case adversecriticism were made.The War Cabinet held the view that it was undesirable thatany such letter should be written, as it could not in itself give anyprotection to the Army Council, and might be construed as anattempt by the Government to exercise influence in a judicialmatter.The discussion then turned on the action taken in the Barrettcase, when it was pointed out that no instructions of the WarCabinet were issued as regards the Terms of Reference, and that thePresident held that he was justified under the Act, taken inconjunction with the Terms of Reference, to report on the conductof the civilians concerned.The War Cabinet felt that, with this precedent before them,the Army Council would have been justified in putting forwardsimilar Terms of Reference as regards the enquiry now being heldin connection with the statements set forth in the report of theMesopotamia Commission.The War Cabinet were of opinion that there could be no justification for the constitution of the Court, as at present arranged,if it was not intended that it should deal with civilians, it being laid down by the Act that civilians could be members of a MilitaryCourt of Enquiry when the character of civilians was.being investi-gated, and that, as the law stood at present, this was the only legalmethod&apos; by which civilians concerned in an enquiry on military matters could be given fair play. As the facts were, it was an enquiry into the partial failure of a: military expedition, in whichthe military officers concerned might possibly claim that their actions were hindered or stultified by certain civilian officials. Itwas pointed out that a reversion to the War Cabinet decision as setforth in War Cabinet 181, Minute 17, would not be consistent with what had been, said in both Houses of Parliament on the previous day, as the statement gave the impression that the Terms ofReference would apply equally to both classes of person, whereas the original Terms of Reference only enquired into the conduct ofsoldiers.The War Cabinet decided that They,would revert to the decision set forth in War Cabinet 181,Minute 17, but that, as a connecting link between thereport of the Mesopotamia Commission, the Army (courts of Enquiry) Act, 1916, and the original Terms of Refer-ence, there should be a preamble to the latter, the particulars of which, together with the original Terms ofReference, are set forth in Appendix    .Shipping Losses: 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by SirControl of Norman Hill (Paper G.T.-1130), and a reply by the AdmiraltyMerchant Shipping.   (Paper G.T.-1273), and other memoranda (Papers G.T.-1308, 1347,1358), in regard to shipping losses.
Sir Norman Hill referred to the heavy losses which had occurred in the concentration areas, namely, the areas off the Fastnet, ToryIsland, and the Scilly Isles. He stated that in these concentrationareas no adequate -protection was given by the Admiralty, and thatthey were regarded by the Merchant Service as death-traps. he described different cases proving the lack of protection, and how, inspite of wireless messages for help, assistance had not been receivedfrom the Admiralty. Sir Norman Hill said the confidence whichthe Merchant Service had had in the Royal Navy at the beginningof the war was being frittered away. Masters of ships received orders to proceed to a rendezvous, and, when they got there, sometimes foundnothing to meet them except an enemy submarine. He urged thatthere should be a better system of protection, and that vessels shouldbe allowed to keep dispersed on their routes as far as possible; forinstance, instead of having a point of concentration coming into theIrish Channel from the North Atlantic at the Fastnet (off the south-west), merchant ships should be permitted to join the protectedroute at any point between the Fastnet and Tuskar. He asked whatforce of destroyers was at the disposal of those responsible for theprotection of merchant ships ; whether the officers responsible were satisfied with the strength of their force ; and, if not, whether anyeffort had been made to increase the force.Captain Webb explained on a large-scale chart the systemof protection afforded by the Admiralty to merchant ships duringthe war. At the beginning of the war the ships were ordered todisperse on their trade routes. Early in 1915, when the Germansembarked on their submarine campaign, the policy of dispersal was continued. In August 1915, when the heavy losses began to occur,the Admiral Commanding at Queenstown recommended that vessels should proceed along the South Coast of Ireland, as more patrol vessels were then available,; and this system of hugging the coast isstill in force.The First Sea Lord pointed out that the suggestion of Sir N.Hill would result in a greater concentration in the danger zone than was given by the system now in force. He then described, bymeans of the chart, a new system of routes&quot;&apos; of exit and approach,which had been adopted on the 1st June, 1917, and which was putin force on the 1st July. This system had, so far, worked well,but was dependent for success on the number of patrol vesselsavailable.Sir Norman Hill said that the latest method, described by admiral Jellicoe, approximated to a system of regular escort, which amounted to protected concentration. What he had objected towas concentration without protection.Captain Fisher was about to give further details of the patrolsystem, but at this point it was necessary for the War Cabinet to adjourn the discussion in order to come to a decision on item 1.It was therefore decided that The discussion should be resumed on the following day at11 a.m., and that in the meantime Sir Norman Hill andthe representative shipowners present should see thevarious officers concerned at the Admiralty.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,Jidy 12, 1917.* It is not considered desirable to print any details of this secret scheme.
