Wholesale Price of flour.1. IN connection with the introduction of the 9d. loaf (WarCabinet 190, Minute 1), the War  Cabinet had before them amemorandum by Lord Rhondda. (G.T.-1820) pointing out that inrespect of flour to be supplied to bakers and other traders, two&apos; alternative courses were open : (1.) To issue cheap flour for all save a few clearly definedpurposes, susceptible of easy control, such as the manu-facture of biscuits and sizing materials.(2.) To sell flour to bakers and other traders at two differentprices (a.) At (say) 43s. 9d. a sack of 280 lb., to be used solely for bread making or for retail sale as flour for domestic consumption.(b.) At (say) 63s., if required for any other purpose, suchas making cake or confectionery.If the first course were adopted, a subsidy of about 1,500,000Z.a year would be granted to bakers in respect of cakes and confectionery-stationery, and exception might be taken to this in Parliament andpossibly by the Allies. On the other hand, there were gravepractical objections to the two-price system. It would be difficultto prevent the dishonest baker using cheap flour for cake. The task of registering the retailers would be a heavy one, and might delay the production of the cheap loaf. In any case two weeks&apos; noticewould have to be given to the bakers to set rid of stocks.The War Cabinet decided In favour of a single ]3rice for all flour, and Lord Bhonddaundertook to announce that the 9d. loaf would be availablenot later than the 17th September.Sale of Bread and sugar at SpecialPrices.2. Lord Rhondda called the attention of the War Cabinet to thefact that certain large firms, for the purposes of advertisement, wereannouncing their readiness to sell bread and sugar at prices below themaximum fixed by the Ministry of Food. They would no doubtrecoup themselves from excess profits, though the customers genes-allywould benefit.The War Cabinet agreed that it would be difficult to interferewith this practice.Compensation forDestruction of roumanian plant and Stocks.3. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a note from theForeign Office to the Director of Military Intelligence (G.T. 1817)and a telegram from Sir G. Barclay, dated the 14th August, relative to the question of compensation for the plant and stocks which itmight be necessary to destroy in Roumania.The War Cabinet decided -To take no action pending further information as to the extentof the destruction, if any, which had taken place.Transport ofRoumanianRefugees.4. The War Cabinet considered a message received by thePrime. Minister from M. Take Jonescu (G.T. 1855), appealing for theprovision of transport for Roumanian refugees across the N orth sea in the event of the evacuation of the whole of Roumania becomingnecessary.It was pointed out that the considerations which applied to thetransport of liberated Italian prisoners from Archangel (WarCabinet 224, Minute 13) applied also to the case of the Roumanians.It was impossible to provide the necessary ships from Archangel.It was suggested, however, that it might be possible for the refugees
to travel by rail to Vladivostock and to cross tbence to the UnitedStates.The War Cabinet decided In view of the time which had elapsed since M. Take Jonescu&apos;s appeal and the difficulty&apos; of finding tonnage to complywith it, it would be better to take no further action inthe matter.5. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to reports thata number of British citizens were travelling to Russia at the presenttime, and to the undesirability of this being allowed in view of thedisturbed conditions in Russia. Some of the travellers were said tobe nurses, and these, it was thought, might be allowed to go.The War Cabinet requested Lord Robert Cecil to ascertain the facts, and take suitableaction.6. The First Sea Lord reported that there was some danger ofan Atlantic convoy being attacked by submarines some 250 milesfrom Ireland, as owing to the severe weather, the escort had notbeen able to reach the convoy.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said there was nothing special to report; the midday communique had not beenreceived from France, owing probably to the gale. The progress ofthe Italians had been arrested. There were no signs of enemvreinforcements arriving, but no doubt they were on the way. the austrians had only 38 divisions, equal to about 350,000 men, on theItalian front, and only about 200,000 of these on their fighting front,as against about 50 Italian divisions. With regard to the advanceof the Italian 3rd Army, which had been checked, it. had to beremembered that the country was mountainous, the roads were few,and the guns had to be left behind.8. With reference to War Cabinet 221, Minute 2, the ActingSecretary stated that Mr. Walter Long wished to be relieved ofthe Chairmanship of the Committee owing to pressure of work.The War Cabinet decided To ask the Earl of Crawford and Balcaires to act as Chairman,and expressed the hope that Mr. Long would be able toserve on the Committee.The Secretary of State for War stated that he was beingapproached with a view to facilitating the use of Edinburgh Castleas a Scottish National Memorial.The War Cabinet decided -That Lord Derby should at present refer any communicationson the subject to the new Committee set up by theCabinet.   (War Cabinet 221, Minute 2.)9. The First Lord undertook to submit a report to the WarCabinet on the building of ships with the aid of concrete, withspecial reference to the recent report of the launching of such a ship in Norwav.
Construction ofMammoth ShipsBattle-cruiserStrength.10. In view of the circumstances set forth in the minute bythe Controller of the Navy (G.T.-1853) as to the steel position andto the view taken by the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller,as to the construction of mammoth ships, the War Cabinet decided To  rescind   the decision   arrived   at   in War Cabinet  130,Minute 18.11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on battle-cruiser strength by the First Lord of the Admiralty (G.T.-1858).The War Cabinet decided That the Foreign Office should, on the initiative of theAdmiralty, open negotiations on the lines indicated by theFirst Lord. -Pope&apos;s peace proposals.12. With reference to War Cabinet 224, Minute 16, the acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had now received information to the effect that the reply of the President ofthe United States to the Pope&apos;s peace overtures was being despatched to the British Foreign Office for transmission to the Pope. Thereason for this was that the United States Government had nodiplomatic representative at the Vatican.Lord Robert Cecil undertook to inform the War Cabinet assoon as President Wilson&apos;s answer was received.Man-Power Drafts 13. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply to afo&quot;r Western Front, question, stated that the number of British troops now under training and doing garrison duty in this country was approximately-g- millions; many of these, however, were lads of eighteen, and thegreat majority of the remainder were not fit for general service.General Robertson said that the British Divisions in france were at the present time about 100,000 short of strength, but in theaggregate the actual&apos;shortage in France only amounted to 50,000.The difference was due to the men not being fully &quot; fluid&quot; and available for use in any Division, and to the fact that a certainnumber of men were always en route between England and the bases and between the bases and the front.Su   lies of Military Secretary of State for War said that he had beenStores to the United   pressed by the Greek Government to furnish them with certainStates and Greece.     military stores, e.g., khaki cloth, woollen blankets, socks, towels, mess-tins, spoons, &amp;c.    He anticipated that heavy demands would shortlyalso be made upon the War Office by the American Government forthese and similar articles.Lord Derby, from the point of view of policy, asked for theinstructions of the War Cabinet as to which Government should begiven preference. He stated that the potential hghting value of theAmerican soldier was higher than that of the Greek, and he wishedto represent that it would be impossible to satisfy the demands ofboth Governments.The War Cabinet decided That, as a matter of policy, the United States should receivefirst consideration, particularly in regard to the supply of clothing, but that the War Office should endeavour, as faras practicable, to meet the wishes of the Greek Governmentin respect of less essential commodities.    k
243British FinancialEepresentative inthe United States.Lord Bobert Cecil said that the United States Secretary to theTreasury felt that there was at present no British representative ofrecognised status or authority in the financial world with whom hecould discuss questions of finance. To meet this difficulty the WarCabinet had asked Lord Beading to undertake a special mission to america. Lord Reading had expressed his willingness to go, butwished to be granted special plenary authority to deal with allfinancial questions without constant reference to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.It was pointed out that the presence in the United States ofSir C. Spring-Pace, Lord Northcliffe, and Lord Reading would mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have virtually the equivalent of three separate Ambassadors in that country, each dealing withspecial questions, and that a situation would thereby be createdwhich was bound to give rise to considerable complications.Lord Robert Cecil further said that Lord Reading was anxious and, in his ownan opportunityto America.After some discussion theopinion, it was most desirable that he should have of conferring with Mr. Balfour before proceedingWar Cabinet authorised-The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to despatchthe draft telegram, and instructed Lord Robert Cecil toinform Mr. Balfour privately of Lord Reading&apos;s desire to consult him.(Initialled; A. B. L.15. With reference to War Cabinet 222, Minute 16, the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs read out the following draft telegram for the British Ambassador at Washington: Lord Northcliffe has found it difficult, in view of the many important commercial matters with which he has to deal, to devote sufficient personal attention to the vital and intricatequestions of finance. He has expressed opinion that thebest method of placing financial position on a firm and definite foundation would be for Lord Beading to discussproblems personally with McAdoo. House, who has been consulted, fully agrees. The War Cabinet have therefore decided, in view of the difficulties which have arisen inconnection with the financial situation, to ask Lord Beadingto go out on a special mission to the United States. Hewill have their full authority to negotiate with the A dminis-tration and to decide on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentany questions that may be raised. Though primarily concerned with finance, he will be authorised to deal withany subject which he considers desirable for the properdischarge of his mission.
