THE War Cabinet further considered their action on theReport of the Mesopotamia Commission (War Cabinet 186, Minute 2),in view of the statement that the Government had promised to make this afternoon to Parliament.The view was held that the feeling in both Houses was against any further enquiry, and the War Cabinet therefore decided To recommend -to Parliament that a Court for such a purpose should not be appointed, but that the case of the military officers whose conduct had been impugned by the Corn-mission should be dealt with by the Army Council, who should take steps to announce in Parliament, at the earliestpossible date, the action they had taken as regards theseveral officers concerned.As regards civilians, it was decided To adopt the course as set out in the statement made in bothHouses of Parliament (Appendix).[1365-189]

118WG 189APPENDIX.Statement to be made in Parliament, July 18, 1917.THE Government has given further attention to the question of the action whichit ought to take in regard to individuals whose conduct was criticised in theMesopotamia Commissions Report.In view of the considerations urged during the recent debates and the objections raised to further enquiry (as a preliminary to executive action) in the case of thepersons implicated in this Report, whether the enquiry were by an existing tribunal orby a Special Statutory Court to be set up for this purpose, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas decided not to proceed further with their former suggestion. In coming to thisdecision they have also been influenced by the undesirability of diverting the thought and enegies of the Legislature and Executive, at this critical time, from the prosecution of the war.As regards the soldiers, the Government have decided that they should be dealtwith by the Army Council in the ordinary way. The decision of the Army Council asto the action taken by them will be announced as soon as possible.As regards Lord Hardinge, the Government, on the representations of the foreign secretary, who alone is in a position to judge, has decided that it would he detrimental to the public interest if the Foreign Office should be deprived, at the present juncture,of the services of Lord Hardinge as Permanent Under-Secretary of State, and has there fore refused his resignation, which has been for the third time proffered.o
