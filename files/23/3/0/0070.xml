The War Cabinet had under consideration a telegram from lord Northcliffe, dated the 21st August, and a note by lord robert Cecil covering a letter from Mr. Balfour to the american ambassador, dated the 16th August (Paper G.T.-1790), on thesubject of the possible requisitioning by the United States Govern-ment of shipping under construction in American yards on Britishaccount.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that Lord Northcliffe hadalready communicated to Colonel House a protest from the PrimeMinister of Australia against the requisitioning of these ships bythe American Government, and was anxious that &quot; an earnest andvigorous protest from His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; should also be presented.   He stated that, in his opinion, it would be unwise toPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1917.SECRET.
adopt Lord NorthcliffVs suggestion, having regard to the pledges given by Mr. Balfour when in America. Moreover, if the UnitedStates had decided to take over the ships, a protest might not prove effective and might only cause irritation and friction. he continued that Mr. Balfour believed that the best chance of persuading the United States Government to allow us to keep theships was to appeal to their sense of justice and goodwill, as hadbeen done in his letter of the 16th August to the american ambassador. *The Shipping Controller pointed out the very serious blow toour prospective tonnage programme amounting to a loss of some4,000,000 tons carrying capacity in a year if we failed to getdelivery of the steamers. Recent public pronouncements as to ourprospective gains in tonnage had taken full account of theAmerican ships. - The ships were urgently needed during the critical period between now and next year&apos;s harvest.The possibility was suggested of negotiating with the UnitedStates Government on the basis of our giving back the vessels afterthe war.Mr. Salter, of the Ministry of Shipping, who had just returned from Washington, where he had had an interview with PresidentWilson on this subject, said that the President was at that time infavour of requisitioning the ships, but had come to that conclusionunder pressure from Mr. Denman, the ex-head of the AmericanShipping Board, and on grounds that were not really relevant,and he had promised to reconsider the question. It must beremembered that there was an element in the United States ofAmerica that was very jealous cf our Mercantile Marine, and alsothat the United States Army and Navy were anxious to carry their troops.and stores to France in their own ships.The War Cabinet decided To support the policy expressed in Mr, Balfour&apos;s letter of the16tli August to the American Ambassador, of appealingto the American sense of justice and goodwill.They asked The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, afterconsultation with the Ministry of Shipping, to telegraphin this sense to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washing-ton, at the same time pointing out the serious blow thatwould be caused to our tonnage programme in the event ofrequisition.Equipment for united states army.2. The Secretary of State for War reported that he had heardprivately that there was a great shortage of equipment for theUnited States Expeditionary Force already in France. Hesuggested that we should assist to meet the deficiency, if asked todo so, bviurnishing clothing and boots, which could be supplied fora fdrqei of 200,000 men.The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for War to give assistance as suggested,if it were asked for officially.The western front:3. The rJirectbf of Militarf Operations .reported that theCanadian troops were now established on the south-west andnoTtfi-weli bf the&apos; outskirts of Leiis, dnd that the prospects of taking Lens1 were good. Very few buildings1 rehlained intact, andall the civilian population had vacated the place.
British Progress. 5. With regard to the progress made in our present offensive,the Director of Military Operations reported that the germans were fighting hard to prevent our taking the Klerken Ridge. Ifwe gained that objective, of which the military authorities werehopeful, though it was too early yet to form a definite opinion,then, provided we had sufficient fighting power left, we ought tohave a good chance of gaining a substantial success.French Advance. 6. The Director of Military Operations gave the latest reports to the effect that the French had gained their objectives on bothbanks of the Meuse.Mesopotamia. 7. In reply to a question as to the possibility of a Britishadvance on Mosul, which had been contemplated in co-operationwith the Russians, the Director of Military Operations said thatGeneral Maude would not take the offensive, except locally as theenemy gave him opportunity, unless the Russians gained a success and were in a position to co-operate.The Italian Front. 8. The Director of Military Operations read a telegram fromGeneral Delme-Radcliffe to the effect that the Italian (Second)Northern Army had further exploited its success; that the austrians opposed to them were not very strong; and that therewas a chance of a big victory being gained by our Allies.The Third Army, wdiich had failed somewhat on the first day,had now recovered. The number of prisoners taken by theItalians up to the morning of the 21st August amounted to 12,000.There was no longer any need for anxiety as to the moral of theItalian Army, which had fought well. The British arlillery(consisting of ninety 6-inch howitzers, all manned by our men) had done good work and only suffered slight casualties, amounting to five killed and ten wounded. One hopeful sign was that theAustrian artillery was becoming much less active, which indicated a retirement of the guns.The Eastern 9. The Director of Military Operations reported that thereFront- w^as no change on the Eastern Front.     General Kornilof  wasexpecting an attack on Riga.Air Raids. 10. The Director of Military Operations reported a raid byseven Zeppelins on the North-East Coast on the previous night;two of the airships had come inland, one near the Humber, theother at Seaham, and bombs had been dropped on Doncaster.Our aircraft had attacked them and chased them out to sea.Ten German aeroplanes had visited the East Coast on the morning of the 22nd, at 10.15 a.m. They had turned and pro-ceeded along the Kentish coast, dropping bombs at Ramsgate,Margate, and Dover. Two enemy aeroplanes had been brought down, and the pilot of one had been captured alive.[1365-222]Casualties. 4. The Director of Military Operations reported that theCanadian casualties during the last ten days had amounted to5,060. Altogether, at Lens and Ypres since the offensive beganthe casualties were 51,400. Of these a large number were gascases, which were only temporary in nature.
Submarines. 11. The First Sea Lord reported that two special service ships had been in action with submarines, one sixty miles south ofLand&apos;s End; the other, which had been torpedoed, but might get to port, thirty-three miles off the Fastnet.Oonvoys. 12. The First Sea Lord reported that on the previous^ after-noon an outward-bound convoy had been attacked near LoughSwilly, whilst being assembled; that the convoying cruiser&quot; Virginian &quot; had been torpedoed, and two large ships, the&quot; Devonian &quot; and another similar vessel of about 11,000 tons, hadbeen sunk. One result was that seventeen steamers were held up at Lough Swilly and must remain there for the present until escortcould be arranged.This occurrence pointed to the difficulty of assembling convoysin waters where submarine attacks were likely, and orders hadbeen given to carry out assembly at Lamlash, although there wasno submarine obstruction in place there as yet.Association for 13. The Secretary of State for War stated that an associationHelping Soldiers for maintaining comradeship after the war amongst those of allafter the War. ranks who had served in the Navy, the Army, or Merchant Ser-vice, and for providing some means.whereby collective expressioncould be given to any grievance under which the men of suchclasses suffered, had been started bv Lieut.-Colonel Sir J. NortonGriffiths.Lord Derby explained that he had welcomed this suggestion,and had done all he could to get it inaugurated on a sound, non-party, democratic basis, for which purpose he had interestedcertain members of Parliament. The idea was that the scheme should be run on Masonic lines, with lodges, much after the pattern of the Posts of the Veterans of the Grand Army in&quot; theUnited States. To do this it would be necessary for him to get into touch with, and correspond with, various officials, such as the lords Lieutenant of counties, the chairmen of Territorial Associa-tions, the chairmen of municipal corporations, mayors, &amp;c, forwhich he asked the authority of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet agreed that the scheme proposed was worthy of every help, and decided that The Secretary of State for War should be authorised to address on this subject any persons or bodies he thought-necessary.British Military 14. The Chancellor of the Exchequer quoted a telegram fromRepresentative in    Lord  Northcliffe asking that a military representative,  whofAm ri       tes    should be an officer of high distinction and war experience, shouldo    menca, ^e gent fco represent the British Government in the United Statesof America. Though, when the question had been raisedpreviously (War Cabinet 177, Minute 7), it had been decided, onthe representation of the American Ambassador in London, not tosend a military representative, the opinion of the United StatesGovernment had apparently changed. The names of variousBritish officers were mentioned in connection with the appoint-ment, and the War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should confer with theChancellor of the Exchequer on this subject the same afternoon.
British naval representative inthe United Statesof America.15. The First Lord, referring to the same telegram from lord northcliffe, pointed out that a senior naval officer had also beenasked for. The matter was, however, awaiting conference with admiral Mayo on his arrival here.British FinancialRepresentative inthe United Statesof America.16. In reference to a telegram dated the 15th August from lord Northcliffe (Paper G.T.-1780), the question of sending aBritish representative to the United States to deal with financial questions was discussed.The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the Prime Minister&apos;s approval,  Lord Readingshould be asked to undertake this mission.(Initialled)A.
