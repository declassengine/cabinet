The question was raised as to the representatives of which of the Allied countries should be invited to attend the Session of theConference on the 8th August. It was pointed out that, thoughrepresentatives of all the Allies except the United States of america had attended the jDrevious meeting of the Conference at Paris, itwas hardly necessary that they should be invited to attend again,since the present Conference was merely a continuation of that heldin Paris. It appeared also that, in any case, in addition to therepresentatives of France and Italy, it would be advisable to limitinvitations to attend to the representatives of the Balkan States,i.e., Greece, Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro.The War Cabinet decided that The point of whether the representatives of the&apos; smaller allied nations should be invited to attend the Inter-Ally Conference onthe 8th August, or whether they should merely be informed of thedecisions taken by that Conference, should be referred to theConference at its Second Session in the afternoon of the 7th August.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 7, 1917.o
