Liquor Control.Air Raids.1. THE question of the resumption of malting was raised, andthe War Cabinet decided To discuss the matter on the following day.2. The Director of Military Operations reported that during the raid on the 12th August the casualties had amounted to 32 killed and 46 wounded.It was generally agreed that it was impossible to take such measures as would render coast towns absolutely immune. Withregard to reprisals, it was stated that there were no machinesavailable at present for this purpose. The War Cabinet were ofopinion, however, that the question should be kept in view, and tothis end invited General Smuts, pending the development of British reprisals, toexamine the possibility of co-operating with the French incarrying out reprisals.The Russian Front.3. The Director of Military Operations reported a slightimprovement on the Eastern front. On the weakest and most dangerous part of the front the Russians were holding their own atpresent.In the Okna region the Roumanians had made a slight counter-attack.Supply of heavy artillery to Russia.4. With reference to War Cabinet 195, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had a short discussion on telegram No. 1236, on the subjectof the supply of guns to Russia.The Director of Military Operations reported that, of the 6-inchhowitzers and 60Tpounders sent to Russia, not more than 44 out of140 had reached the front. It was stated that it was impossibleto send guns to Russia as well as to Italy, and also to replace theheavy wastage on the Western front. It was pointed out, however,that if a choice has to be made between abandoning the Russiangun programme or slowing down at Ypres, the decision must betaken by the War Cabinet. Moreover, particularly in view ofM. Kerensky&apos;s statement, reported in the telegram under con-sideration, &quot; that if we were going to bargain about guns and didnot intend to help Russia, we had better say so straight out,&quot; itwas felt that to stop the supply altogether might have grave political consequences.The War Cabinet decided To examine the question in detail on the following day, whenGenera] Furse, General Poole, the Minister of Munitions,and the Shipping Controller should be invited to attend.March of UnitedStates troops through London.5. The Secretary of State for War reported that United states troops were to march through London on the following day. TheAmerican Embassy had expressed the strongest objection to anydisplay or any entertainment on the occasion of this march, and hadprohibited any publicity whatever, notwithstanding the fact that thetroops were to carry out a considerable march through the streetsand be reviewed by His Majesty the King. This decision was partly due to the risk of air raids, and partly, perhaps, to the feailest owing to lack of drill and equipment the men might not create a good impression.
The War Cabinet felt that as the troops were to march, a greaterdemonstration was desirable, and decided that The Secretary of State for War should see the Ambassador ofthe United States at once, with a view to an announcement in the evening papers and a greater display.Publication ofStatementCorrecting theGermanAllegation inregard to sinking of Merchantmen.6. The First Sea Lord reported that the French Minister of marine at the recent Naval Conference in Paris had raised thequestion of publishing corrections to German statements on thesubject of the sinking of merchant ships. He read the proposed announcement, which had been drafted by the French Minister of marine, showing that the German figures gave an average increase of40 per cent, above the real facts.The Prime Minister took a note of this point for his forthcomingspeech on the following Thursday.Mesopotamia.7. The Director of Military Operations reported that theTurkish attack in Mesopotamia was not likely to develop on the scaleanticipated before the end of October, but that General Maude, inorder to be on the safe side, had made his preparations for an earlier date.The Oil Situationin England.8. The War Cabinet had before them a draft Bill, prepared byMr. Longs Committee (Paper G.T.-1G90), in order to make provisionwith respect to the search and boring for, and the getting of, petroleumin the United Kingdom. The question of the amount of the royaltywas discussed.The War Cabinet decided that The draft Bill should be introduced, and that the royalty shouldbe fixed at 9d. a ton.Sir J. ComptonPiickett&apos;s Report.9. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the SelectCommittee on National Expenditure, enquiring whether it would bepossible for them to see a copy of the Report of Sir J. ComptonRicketfs Committee on the Expansion of War Staffs.The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary to communicate the Report of Sir J. ComptonRicketfs Committee to the Select Committee on national expenditure for their confidential use.Inter-Ally Councilto Co-ordinateRequirements for american Supplies.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary in regard to Lord Northcliffe&apos;s telegram of the 9thAugust.Lord Curzon undertook to reassemble his Committee and toadvise the War Cabinet.Indian Reforms:Formula of theNew Policy.11. The War Cabinet resumed the discussion on this subjectadjourned at their meeting on the 5th July, 1917 (War Cabinet 176,Minute 18). Since that date three papers had been submitted fortheir consideration, viz., a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (Paper G.T.-1615); a copy of a letter from Mr. A.Chamberlain to Mr. Montagu (Paper G.T.-1664); and a note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper G.T.-1696) (Appendix I).Mr. Montagu briefly recapitulated the main points raised in his memorandum.   He said that he was asking for nothing which had
not been urged by his predecessor in office.   He was in entire agreement with the Viceroy, whose position was becoming dailymore and more difficult, in thinking that an immediate pronounce-ment of the policy to be pursued was essential.   Every postponement,every day of delay in announcing the policy, increased the dangerof the present situation.   Six months ago, a mere statement of the goal aimed at might have eased that situation; to-day that state-ment must be accompanied by a definite indication of the steps itwas proposed to take to carry out the objects in view.   Mr. Montaguquoted from a letter and a telegram from Lord Chelmsford, deploringthe apparent indecision of His Majesty&apos;s Government   and   thecontinued delay in settling so urgent a question.   At the presentmoment the Extremists in India were having it all their own way ;the Moderates were asking for a lead, and, being denied it, werewavering.   There was a serious risk of their throwing in their lotwith the agitators.   Every day of postponement meant an increasein the demands of the Extreme Party.    Already Lord Pentlandhad   found   it  impossible   to   avoid   making   a   communique,  indefault   of   any   instructions   from   His   Majesty&apos;s   Government.Mr.  Montagu further urged that any pronouncement authorised by the War Cabinet must satisfy the Viceroy, whose desire wasto giv7e the Moderates an answer to the Extremists.   The viewsof the   Indian   Government,   of the   India  Office,  and   of the moderate party, were, in the main, identical.   He was convinced,however, that any formula decided upon must contain the words&quot; ultimate self-government within the Empire.&quot;   He was aware thatobjection had been raised to the use of the phrase &quot; self-government,&quot;but the word had become a shibboleth, and its exclusion would createsuspicion about the whole announcement of policy.   The question would be asked as to why it was avoided, unless it was to cover a real difference between the Moderates in India and the Cabinet;therefore there was a risk that the announcement would fail of its purpose.  He was quite prepared to draw up a formula, in conjunctionwith Lord Curzon, for the consideration of the Cabinet, but he sub-mitted that no formula could be acceptable which was not approvedby the Viceroy and did not include &quot; self-government.&quot;Lord Curzon said that his reluctance to accept the word&quot;self-government&quot; arose from his knowledge that it conveyed toEnglishmen and Indians such very different ideas. Our interpre-tation of it connoted a progressive advance on the lines of localgovernment in this country, a gradual extension of the area otinfluence of Indians from the spheres of district and provincialto those of more responsible administration. Mr. Chamberlain had used the phrase &quot; free institutions.&quot; To the Indian that mean insti-tutions free from English interference and control. When theCabinet used the expression &quot; ultimate self-government&quot; theyprobably contemplated an intervening period that might extend to 500years ; the Indian mind determined that period by a generation only.Everybody who had experience of India, knowdeclge of the people,and sympathy with their aspirations, knew that, for the good ofthe country, England must continue to rule unless India were torelapse into chaos or be dominated by some other nation lessqualified to guide her destinies. He wished to remind the Cabinetthat India had 315,000,000 inhabitants, of whom 295,000,000 couldread or write no language. English was the language of Governmentand of debate, and yet less than 1,750,000 had any knowledge of theEnglish tongue. To grant self-government, as understood anddesired by the Extremists, would simply mean setting up a narrowoligarchy of clever lawyers. He thought, therefore, that extremecare should be taken in the wording of any formula which it mightbe decided to employ. With a view to meeting the dangers whichhe had sketched, he had prepared a formula which he had alreadysubmitted to Mr. Montagu : :
&quot;The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that of the increasing association of Indians in every branch of theadministration, and the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the fuller realisation of responsible government in India under the aegis of the British Crown.&quot;Mr. Montagu said that the only word in this formula which hewas disposed to query was the word &quot; fuller.&quot;Lord Curzon suggested substituting the word &quot; progressive.&quot;Mr. Montagu accepted this amendment on condition that it would satisfy the Viceroy, but repeated his preference for the word &quot; self-government.&quot;The Prime Minister thought that the following paragraph in lord Curzon&apos;s paper of the 2nd July, 1917 (Paper G.T.-1252),represented generally the views of the Cabinet: &quot; What we do mean is that the area in which self-government exists shall be extended step by step ; that thepowers of self-government shall be enlarged ; that the numberof Indians who participate in self-government shall steadilyincrease until a time arrives when Indian representative opinion,trained and moulded by experience, will have the predominantinfluence in the administration of the country.&quot;The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Lord Curzon&apos;s formula, as amended above, should beadopted, viz. :The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that ofthe increasing association of Indians in everybranch of the administration, and the gradualdevelopment of self-governing institutions, wdtha view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India under the aegis of the BritishCrown.(b.) The Secretary of State for India should communicate atonce to the Viceroy the terms of the proposed announce-ment, and should submit the draft telegram0 to lord curzon; and that Mr. Montagu should report to them the Viceroy&apos;s views.12. The Secretary of State for India further asked for adecision of the War Cabinet in regard to the steps to be taken inorder to carry out the objects they had in view. In his paper of the30th July, 1917, he had suggested two alternatives : (a.) That a deputation should proceed to India in the coldweather  to   discuss   these   matters with   the  Indian&apos; Government.(b.) That the Secretary of State should accept the Viceroy&apos;invitation to proceed to India to discuss these matters with the Viceroy.Mr. Montagu said that alternative proposals of a similarcharacter had been put forward by his predecessor. The invitationextended to Mr. Chamberlain by the Viceroy to visit India had beenrenewed to himself immediately on his assuming office. So far ashis own feelings and views were concerned, despite the difficulties involved, which were largely met by the fact that the invitation camespontaneously from the Viceroy, he. thought it advisable on thewhole that he should go to India, more especially as there were atthe present time various matters connected with reforms on whichthere were differences of opinion between his Department and the steps to be takento give effect tothe New Policy.a note. A copy of the telegram is printed as Appendix II.[1365-214] C
Indian Government, and he was hopeful that these points of differencemight be satisfactorily disposed of before publication by personalintercourse between himself and Lord Chelmsford and his Council.There was a precedent for the Secretary of State visiting India, as lord Crewe, when holding that position, had been absent for aconsiderable time in order to attend the King at the*last DelhiDurbar. No departmental difficulties had arisen during theinterregnum. Lord Islington was experienced in Indian affairs,there was a Vice-President of the Indian Council at home, and notrouble of any kind need, he thought, be apprehended. He wouldbe quite prepared, despite the dangers of interposing a third set of opinions at this stage, to agree to a deputation if the Cabinet cotddfind a suitable leader of such a deputation.Lord Curzon said that he adhered to his views expressed atprevious meetings when the question had been discussed (WarCabinet 172, Minute 13, and War Cabinet 176, Minute 18). Hehad himself strongly urged Mr. Chamberlain to charge himself withthe duty of investigating the situation on the spot. The appoint-ment of a deputation might simply introduce a fresh and divergentopinion, and throw upon the Cabinet in a few months&apos; time the onus of deciding between three separate schemes of reform. Whatwas required was agreement, and agreement at the earliest possible date.The War Cabinet sanctioned The Secretary of State for India&apos;s proceeding to indian the autumn to discuss with the Viceroy and theGovernment of India the best measures to be taken togive effect to the policy they had that day, after the most careful consideration, agreed should be adopted, toconsider with the Viceroy the views of Local Governments,and to receive with him the suggestions of representative bodies and others.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 14, 1917.
APPENDIX I.G.T.-1615.Indian Reforms.IT was suggested on the last occasion when this matter was discussed at theWar Cabinet that it was impossible for His Ma&quot;jesty&apos;s Government &quot; in the midst ofa great war to give adequate time and thought to the proper and full considerationof so important and complex a question.&quot; Since the date of the meeting there hasbeen a change in the Secretaryship of State for India, and the Viceroy has expressedin a telegram to the Prime Minister his natural anxiety lest the change in office should delay the formulation of a definite scheme of action. I should wish to reassure the Viceroy in this regard, and have therefore lost no time in studying this difficult question.The Cabinet are aware that the Viceroy, the Government of India, and the heads of Provinces are urging most strongly that a public announcement should bemade on the policy that is to be pursued. In repeated telegrams Lord Chelmsfordhas impressed upon those in authority at home the importance of a prompt decision.In his letters to the late Secretary of State the Governor of Bombay has taken thesame line, and he holds that the delay that has already occurred has strengthenedthe hands of those working against the Government by their advocacy of theimpracticable policy of immediate and complete Home Rule for India. I feel thatour duty to the Viceroy requires that he should be put in possession of a definite policy with which he and his Government can meet what I may call the growiugIndian &quot; opposition.&quot;The Russian Revolution, the activities of Mrs. Besant and her friends, the issueof the Mesopotamian Commission Report, the improved status given to India by herrepresentation at the Imperial War Conference and the Imperial War Cabinet,seem to have produced a situation in which, unless a certainty of substantial reformis at once conceded to India, the Indian Government and its friends have reasonto fear a considerable recruitment to the extreme party from the moderate party,such as has occurred in Ireland, and a general feeling of discouragement andpessimism which would be very grave in its results.The problem for us to solve, therefore, is this. - We must endeavour to find some immediate pronouncement without prolonged discussion in the Cabinet orefforts to solve vastly complicated questions in a time of such preoccupation, but wemust find an announcement which satisfies the necessities of the moment.I would suggest that the public statement must include both the objects whichwe have in view and the steps which we propose to take to carry out those objects.As regards the objects which we have in view, it seems to me desirable to statethem for the following reasons : 1. In order that Indians may be given to understand that, provided they aremoderate in their demands as to the fulfilment of the object, rational and constitu-tional in the steps that they take towards the achievement of the object, their desire for ultimate self-government within the Empire is not regarded by the BritishGovernment as hostile or criminal, but indeed as a legitimate aspiration.2. That it may be declared that the objects which the British Government have in view; objects which many British Governments have in the past had in view are not dissimilar from the objects which really loyal Indians of nationalisttendencies have in view.S. In order that young Indians who take an interest in their country and youngcivilians who take up the great work of helping to govern India may hav^e a test bywhich to mark the success of their lives&apos; work, the degree in Avhich they are enabled to carry affairs towards the goal which we should have set them.But in order to obviate prolonged discussions, the formula which I feel inclined to recommend to the War Cabinet ought to be merely a statement of the general principles of policy, and should not be explained or elaborated at the present stage.When Parliament is asked to sanction the steps which must immediately be taken towards this goal, or when the Cabinet is deciding on these steps,-it might be possibleto define what we mean or do not mean by self-government. -[1365-214] D
I am myself prepared to accept at this stage the wording proposed on several occasions by Mr. Chamberlain : &quot; The gradual development of free institutions witha view to self-government.&quot; In my opinion, no formula which does not include thewords &quot;self-government&quot; is any use for the purposes 1 and 2 above, for without these words we do not give the moderate his answer to the extremist. The Royalprogressive Indian says in effect to the Government: &quot;I look forward to self-government eventually. Do you? Tell me, in order that I may as your friendanswer your enemies. If you do we have community of purpose. If you don&apos;t,say so, and I shall have to join those who are hostile to you.&quot;I have my own views on what is likely to be the form of ultimate self-governmentin India. I think it will tend towards a commonwealth of self-governing provincesor countries united to the Home Government, to one another, and to the NativeStates.This is my view of the ultimate, and possibly in its complete form unrealisable,ideal to which our policy should approximate as the years go on, and if this were laid down with proper cautions and safeguards, I believe it would serve the useful purpose of ending any tendency to an alternation or variation in our policy betweendevolution and centralisation; for devolution would then be accepted as the propermethod of progress and every Viceroy, Governor and Civil Servant would know of itas settled policy.I wish to guard myself against misapprehension. I do not niean that theexisting provinces would necessarily be the self-governing provinces. I do not meauthat there is any chance, in my opinion, of dealing with the different countries inIndia simultaneously in the same way; just as some provinces have receivedExecutive Councils before others, as some provinces get High Courts before others,so it may well be that some provinces will eventually become self-governing whileother provinces may never become self-governing; it may be that some provinces mayget at once reforms not possible in others for many years, if at all. In fact, I agreewith Lord Curzon when he says that &apos;&apos; different forms or degrees of self-governmentwill be attained in different parts, some more, and others less advanced.&quot; Indeed,if Lord Curzon were to agree that there might be in India, some clay or other, someStates enjoying responsible government, there would be no material differencebetween my views and the views which he expresses in his Memorandum.But I would submit, in order to save the CabineCs time, that this point doesnot much matter at this stage. If we content ourselves with a statement made inthe House of Commons of the kind which I suggest below, at a later date when our plans are complete we can decide whether we can go into greater detail.It will, however, be agreed by those interested in the subject, and in particularby the Viceroy, that no statement or formula of the kind that I have suggested is any use without practical steps showing that we really mean what we say and that we.are intending to obtain the necessary legislation as soon as may be, possibly not tillimmediately after the war. Therefore we must accompany a statement as to our aim by some announcement as to action. I agree most thoroughly that such actioncannot be elaborated by the War Cabinet now. Indeed, if the Cabinet had time,matters are not ripe for such a discussion. The Viceroy has sent home proposals.They have been submitted to a Committee of the India Council, and I do not think am guilty of exaggeration when I say that the proposals of the Government ofIndia do not survive this examination.It seems to be agreed by all concerned that despatch and counter-despatch doesnot promise a speedy solution of our problem, and I see that various suggestions have been before the Government on the subject of a Commission of Enquiry,that a Commission was finally accepted by the Viceroy, but with great reluctance.I find in the Office some draft terms of reference sketched by Mr. Chamberlain before he left office (see Appendix (A)). I append them to show how alarming a commission would be, and yet the terms of reference are none too wide to do any good. But theidea of a Commission with such terms of reference roaming round the Government ofIndia is abhorrent. Indeed, a Commission with stated terms of reference seems tome bad policy.It seems to me that what we want to do is to bring London and Simla togetherwith a view to elaborating a policy. I would not send out a Commission. I think the right thing would be to send out a Deputation which would inform itself ofthe views of those interested here and then go out to India to confer with theViceroy and his Government and anybody else whom the Viceroy and theDeputation thought they ought to see.   It might be possible that after a few weeks
Appendix (A).Whereas we are desirous of developing self-government in our Empire ofIndia:And whereas the Indian Councils Act, 1909, and the rules made under it madedivers important changes in the constitution and functions of the Indian LegislativeThese arealternatives.These arealternatives.in India the Viceroy and the Deputation would have agreed upon a cut and driedplan. It might be possible that they would agree between them to the appointmentof Committees to work out the details of particular plans. It might be possiblethat the preliminary step of a conference between a Deputation on behalf of theGovernment and the Government of India would lead ultimately to the formationof a Commission. But as a preliminary step a conference in India seems to me ofthe greatest possible value. The Viceroy was anxious that Mr. Chamberlain as secretary of State should visit India himself, and this policy had the great advantage (there are innumerable disadvantages) of avoiding the introduction ofa third body or persons into the discussion and the formidable task of absorbingits views into the views of others interested. No sooner did I assume office thanthe Viceroy sent me a cordial telegram urging me to transfer his invitation toMr. Chamberlain to myself. When one has to co-operate with a man whom one doesnot know at, all, 3,000 miles away, the temptation to have a talk with him is almostirresistible. On the other hand, for a Minister to be away for two or three months from London just now is very difficult. Like my predecessor, I am in the hands ofthe Cabinet. I would be inclined to suggest to the Cabinet this sort of immediate announcement: &quot; His Majesty?s Government and the Government of India have in view the gradual development of free institutions in India with a view to ultimateself-government within the Empire. They have decided that substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as possible. As a preliminary to considering what the steps in this direction should be, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have decided that it is of the highest importance that there should be a free and informal exchange of opinion between those in authority at home andin India.   They have therefore decided &quot; either (a) &quot; that a Deputation should proceed to India in the coldweather to discuss these matters with the Governmentof India.&quot;or      (&amp;) &quot; that the Secretary of State should accept the Viceroy&apos;invitation to proceed to India to discuss these matters with the Viceroy.&quot;&quot; The names of those who will &quot; either (a) &quot; form the Deputation &quot;or      (&amp;) &quot; accompany the Secretary of State will be published later.&quot;&apos;; I may add that there will be ample opportunity for public discussion ofthe proposals that will be submitted in due course to Parliament. The Govern-ment, on whom the responsibility lies as the trustees of the Indian people, are convinced that immediate self-government is impossible and agitation for it ismischievous. In this view I am certain all responsible and well-informedpersons will agree. The time at which the ultimate stage is reached must depend on the success of the intermediate stages and the co-operation of thoseupon whom they will confer new opportunities of service to India.&quot;If the Cabinet think fit to sanction either of these alternatives, I shall, at oncetelegraph to the Viceroy to ascertain whether he agrees or wishes to make any suggestions.E. S. M.30^ July, 1917.P.S. In case any member of the Cabinet may think that the questions raised in this Note are not of extreme urgency, I have collected in Appendix (B) a numberof extracts from telegrams and letters from the Viceroy, the Governor of Bombay,and Sir James Meston, to show how united the highest authorities in India are in holding that an immediate pronouncement is necessary. These extracts speak for themselves.
Councils and in the constitution of the Executive Councils of the Governors of thePresidencies of Madras and Bombay, and also authorised the creation of similarCouncils in other provinces:And whereas a sufficient period of time has elapsed for the working of theprovisions of the Act of 1909 to be ascertained and we are advised that the time has come for a further advance: *We have deemed it expedient that a Commission should forthwith issue toexamine and report upon the following matters in connection with the legislative and Executive Councils, Imperial and Provincial: 1. The working of the Legislative Councils since their reconstitution in 1909,with special regard to their legislative, political and administrativeresults.2. Whether the Legislative Councils as now constituted adequately representor within the numerical limits fixed by the Statute of 1909 can be constituted so as adequately to represent, the different classes and interests of the community.3. The effect, as regards the representative character of the legislative councils, of the system on which the constituencies are formed and theelections held; and what changes are desirable in either.4. Whether greater effect should be given to the elective principle in consti-tuting the Councils.5. What powers should be given to the&apos; Legislative Councils in matters oflegislation, administration, and finance, and whether the constitutional position of the Councils to the Executive Government should be modified.6. Whether the Executive Councils are suitably constituted.or6. Whether any and what changes should be made in the Executive Councils,and what consequential changes would be required in subordinatebranches of the administration.7. Whether for the better attainment of these ends, and if so in what respects,the control now exercised by the Secretary of State in Council over theGovernment of India, and by the Government of India over the local governments, in financial and administrative matters should be relaxed,and a more complete separation effected between the Imperial and theProvincial finances.And generally to consider the requirements of government in India and torecommend such modifications or expansions in the existing constitutional system as may seem to them expedient.Appendix (B).(a.) Extracts from Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State,dated the 18th May, 1917.The present situation renders it extremely desirable that Government shouldmake some public declaration in regard to constitutional and administrative changes proposed after the war and also as to its attitude towards agitation inauguratedby Home Rule League.The Russian Revolution, publication of statements as to right of the peoplesto govern themselves, the reception accorded to representatives of India at the recentWar Conference by the authorities in the United Kingdom and by the representa-tives of the Dominions, the feeling that India had done so much to assist the Empireduring the war and the general democratic influences of the war, have in the last few months affected political feeling in India materially.The agitation for immediate Home Rule is being fomented with great vigourby Mrs. Besant, Tilak, and others, and, in absence of any definite announcementof Government as to its policy in the matter, is attracting many of those whohitherto have held less advanced views.Jt, A(, M.

On the other hand, there is an influential, though timid, unorganised, andcomparatively inarticulate body of opinion which is opposed to and afraid of anysudden and violent changes in the constitution and looks to Government for supportagainst the extremist propaganda. There are also many waverers who are looking to us for guidance. The omission of Government to make its attitude clear on thissubject is misunderstood by the general public and leaves a free field to extremists.The absence, indeed, of any pronouncement has been the cause of some embarrasment to Local Governments.Dated May 18, 1917.We have given this matter of an announcement very careful consideration, andit has been pressed upon us by the Government of Bombay, who are particularly affected by the Home Rule agitation. We have hesitated, therefore, to press yonfor a decision at a time of such grave preoccupation, but we feel now that it is our duty to do so.Dated June 11, 1917.The position here is becoming increasingly difficult owing to my inability tomake any authoritative announcement of policy.

I found, alas, that no decision hadbeen come to, and the Viceroy told me that the Cabinet was meeting to settle boththis matter and also the advisability of a committee of enquiry.I have written so much on all this matter to you of late that I am almostashamed to say more, but I must put to you what I feel to be a very grave clanger indelaying a pronouncement.Tilak and Mrs. Besant and their party have a positive policy which is gainingadherents every day, chiefly for the reason that Government has nothing positive tooffer themselves. Any speech that is made by any of us must be of an absolutelynegative character ; we may tell them what they can&apos;t have, but we mayn&apos;t tell them what they may look forward to. Many moderates I know of are getting absolutelyhopeless of Government giving a lead, and are going over to the Tilak side.Dated June 25, 1917.I must express my confirmed opinion to you once more that I think we shouldhave avoided all this trouble (i.e., increase in Home Rule agitation) if a declarationof policy clear and distinct and without qualifications had been made a year ago.If it is made now it may do some good, but I fear it is too late, for the Home RuleLeaguer will say that he has forced it out of an unwilling Government.(d.) Extracts from Note by Sir James Meston, dated May 1917.The demand in India for further constitutional advance has reached a stage atwhich it merits the early and special attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government.* * * * *The circumstances which combine to bring the question into peculiar from-nence now are these: (1.) It is known that the late Viceroy was keenby interestedin it, that Lord Chelmsford has taken it up with equal keenness, and that proposals have actually been advanced by the Government of India. (2.) A definite schemewas recently presented to the Government of India by a section of the Viceroy&apos;sLegislative Council, and there is much speculation as to how far their recommenda-tions correspond with or ignore that scheme. (3.) The National Congress has alsoput forward a revised constitution, and although that body has been urging reformfor thirty years, its demand to-day has a special insistence, and appeals to a much larger constituency than at any period in its history. For, after years of schism,the two parties in the Congress the Extremists and the Moderates have united in what was virtually a surrender by the Moderates to the Extremists; and, what seven more striking, the Congress has for the first time absorbed the Moslem league in a common policjr, and put an end to the traditional Mahommedan attitude ofaloofness from Hindu aspirations. I am aware that many observers consider theNationalist sentiment to be more extensive than intensive, and regard the racialentente as ephemeral. My own conviction is that Nationalism is both spreadingrapidly and sinking deeply, and that it has permanently captured the youngMahommedan party. (4.) The last circumstance which I need mention as giving aspecial fillip to the demands for progress is the unexpected consideration which hasbeen paid to India in the recent Imperial Councils. The cordiality of her receptionwill gratify India enormously, but it must also and inevitably stimulate her anxiety to meet the Dominions at future Conferences on terms of greater equality as regardsher own domestic position.* * *       -      * *Now what is it that we ask for ? (a.) In the first place, we suggest a definite and authoritative statement of British policy in India. There is, I take it, noquestion that our business in India is to fit it for ultimate self-government. Opinionsdiffer enormously as to when it will be fit; but that is a practical issue which must beleft to the future. The goal of free institutions is there, however near or howeverdistant; it has presumably always been there, and why should we not say so? a clear declaration by the Secretary of State in Parliament, or in such other manner as he may advise, would sweep away a mass of doubt and difficulty and distrustwhich is at present hampering India at every turn.
Indian Reforms.G.T.-1664.Copy of Letter from Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Secretary of State for India.My dear Montagu, &apos;: Rowfant,&quot; Crawley, Sussex, August 8, 1917.I have read your Memorandum on Indian reforms with great interest and practically with complete agreement with such complete agreement, indeed, thatI might well stop here but for the possibility that the fuller expression of myagreement may be of some use to you.1. You are right to press on the Cabinet that a very early pronouncement isnecessary to avoid the growth of a most serious and even dangerous movement. one cannot help seeing that all the authorities in India are anxious. They and our friends outside Government are puzzled and hesitating. There is still time to takethe lead and keep control of the situation, but the Cabinet must act quickly.2. I am convinced that it is useless to boggle at the phrase &quot; self-government.&quot;Hardinge and others have countenanced its use. Moderate opinion adopts it. Theacceptance by you with the necessary limitations would, in fact, commit you to lessthan would its definite rejection by you; and you must either accept or reject itt- you cannot pass it by in silence.3. I much prefer the alternative (b) of your proposed announcement. On thispoint I have changed my mind. I think that Curzon was right in deprecating theintroduction of a third and independent body between the Government of India andthe Secretary of State.4. I have referred under (2) to &quot; necessary limitations.&quot; These, to my mind,are three-fold :  (a.) That, as stated by you, the agitation for immediate Home Rule is foolishand mischievous.(b.) That the time and nature of each fresh step in advance must be determinedby His Majesty&apos;s Government.(c.) That in speaking of the gradual development of free institutions with aview to self-government, and in particular by the use of the term self-government, you do not pretend to define the exact course or the exactform which that development will ultimately take. Healthy institu-tions grow, and in their growth adapt themselves to the specialcircumstances of the country and special conditions of the peoples fcvwhom they are intended. If and when India possesses a real politicalsense and widely diffused political aptitudes, she will not slavishly copy,she will adapt and vary in accordance with the genius of her own people,the western institutions which she takes as her general model. Rigidityis the pitfall in our present system. Elasticity is the first condition of progress.I should be inclined to add id) growth of power must be accompanied by growth of the sense of responsibility. Indeed, no great increase of power is possible till anincreased sense of responsibility makes itself evident.I wish you would consider whether a few words in the sense of (b) and (c), and perhaps (d), might not usefully be added to your pronouncement without over-loading it.One other point. I would suggest that you make it quite clear that whilst the primary object of the Secretary of State&apos;s visit to India is to confer with theViceroy, you will take the opportunity of seeing representatives of different shades of non-official Indian, and English opinion.I would lay more stress on this than on the public discussion which may comelater.Yours verv sincerely.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.(Private.)Of course, you did right to use the private correspondence freely. If it would help you to show this letter or any part of it to Curzon or the Cabinet, please use icas you think best. A. C.[1365-214] &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;        &quot; F
A Note on Indian Reform.G.T.-1696. -WHEN the question of Indian reforms came up before the Cabinet shortly before Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s resignation, I expressed orally the difficulty I felt in accepting the formula which embodied the policy of the Viceroy and the India Office.This formula is again urged upon us, without substantial modification, byMr. Montagu ; and, though I admit the great strength of the case which he maker,in its favour, I feel constrained to put on record the reasons why I view it withthe gravest misgiving.The whole difficulty centres on the word &quot; Self-Government.&quot; This, accordingto the highest authorities, both in India and at home, is the &quot; word of power.&quot; Ifwe promise Self-Government at however remote a period, Indian public opinion will,it seems, be satisfied. If we promise anything else, however desirable, and howevereasy of attainment, we shall promise in vain. Moderate reformers and extremistswill combine against us, and the Government of India will become difficult orimpossible.The advantages of pledging ourselves to work towards &quot; Self-Government &quot; as our ideal of Indian reform are obviously very strong. What ai-e the arguments against it ?To my thinking, they may be stated somewhat as follows : The word &quot; Self-Government,&quot; as applied to any fraction of the British Empire,has a perfectly definite and familiar meaning. It means Parliamentary Governmenton a democratic basis. This is not only its recognised meaning ; among men ofBritish race it is the meaning which will be universally attributed to it in India. Sothat, if we promise to work towards Self-Government, we promise in fact to establishin India, some day or other, a Government on the same lines as that which has been set up in Canada, Australasia, and the Cape.Now everybody admits that for India, as it is, this form of Government istotally unsuitable. Where I differ, with some misgiving, from high Indian authorities,is in holding the view that in all probability neither the lapse of time nor the develop-ment of education will ever make it suitable. East is East and West is West.Even in the West, Parliamentary institutions have rarely been a great success, exceptamongst the English-speaking peoples. In the East, not only have they never been seriously tried, hut they have never been seriously desired, except by intellectuals whohave come under Western influences. In negro States like Liberia and San Domingo,where they have been tried, they have proved disastrous and almost ludicrous failures.But it may be replied that these two black republics are inhabited by inferiorraces. Have we any right to predicate inferiority of our Indian fellow-citizens ?Certainly I should commit myself to no such general statement. I doubt, indeed,whether any general statement can be made about the many races which inhabitIndia, except that they all belong to the genus Hovio. There are some from the pre-historic Arian immigrants down to the last civil service clerk who belong to the mostdistinguished human breeds; and, whether they be specially qualified or not for thatdifficult form of social activity which we call Parliamentary Government, they atleast possess great qualities of intellect and imagination. But does India as a wholepossess the characteristics which would-give Parliamentary Government a chance?To me it seems that it does not. People often talk as if democracy producedequality. The truth is that democracy is only successful where equality fundamentalracial equality approximately exists already. Where racial differences are clear-cut and profound, where a race obviously superior is mixed with a race obviously inferior,the superior race may be constituted as a democracy, but into that democracy theinferior race will never be admitted. It may be kept out by law, as in South Africa,or it may be kept out by practice, as in the Southern States of America; but kept outit wdll he.The problem of India, I admit, is not so simple. The lines of demarcationbetween races, even when they are emphasised by the system of caste, are not nearly so sharply marked as those which in America and Africa divide white from black.But personally I believe the differences are quite sufficient to make real Parlia-mentary institutions unworkable in the future, as they are admittedly unworkablein the present.
The demand for them comes from Eastern intellectuals inspired by Westernmodels. This does not make the demand less formidable, but it does make the fulfil-ment of it much less likely to succeed. Parliamentary institutions in English-speaking countries are of natural and spontaneous growth. In India they would beutterly alien and artificial. Graft them upon the ancient and unchanging socialsystem of the East, and you will produce a hybrid which will certainly be worthlessand probably dangerous. Nor would education provide any sufficient remedy : for education cannot fundamentally alter the material on which it works, and it is theessential character and variety of that material which in India is the bar to politicaladvance along the rather narrow and specialised lines which have been found to yieldgood results in England and America.To me, then, it appears that if we promise Serf-Government we shall be promisingsomething which, in the sense already defined, we neither cam nor ought to give.A system under which India shall more and more be governed by Indians, we maywell hope to develop. If it be thought that such a form of Government may properly be described as Self-Government (as perhaps it may) we might defend inthis way the inclusion of the magic word in our statement of policy. But I greatlyfear that this is not the sense in which it would he understood by those to whom theformula is addressed, and, if so, they will have much cause to complain when itsentire meaning becomes fully apparent.A. J. B.Foreign Office,August 7, 1917.APPENDIX II.Copy of a Letter from Private Secretary to Secretary of State for India to Major Storr,Assistant Secretary, War Cabinet.Dear Storr,Mr. Montagu asks me to se::d you the enclosed copy of the telegram on Reforms,which, after Lord Curzon had approved it, was sent last night.Yours sincerely,(Signed) C. EL KISCH.Secretary of State to Viceroy, I4f/i August, 1917.(Private.)Reforms. Subject to your consent, the Cabinet have to-day authorised me tomake the following announcement : &quot; The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that of the increasing association of indians in every branch of the administration, and the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to progressive realisation of responsible Governmentin India under the aegis of the British Crown. They have decided that substantialsteps in this direction should be taken cis soon cis possible. As a preliminary to considering what these steps should be, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided thatit is of the highest importance that there should be a free and informal exchange ofopinion between those in authority at home and in India. They have accordingly decided that T should accept the Viceroy&apos;s invitation to proceed to India to discuss these matters with the Viceroy and the Government of India, to consider with theViceroy the. views of Local Governments and to receive with him the suggestions of representative bodies and others.&quot; I may add that there will be ample opportunity for public discussion of theproposals that will be stibmitted in due course to Parliament. The British Govern-ment, on whom, with the Government of India, the responsibility lies for the welfare and
advancement of the Indian people, must be the judges of the time and measure of eachadvance. They are convinced that the progress which they contemplate can only be accomplished by successive stages, and they must be guided by the extent to which at each stage they receive the co-operation and can repose confidence in the sense ofresponsibility of those upon whom new opportunities of service will thus be conferred.&quot;I will consider, of course, any suggestions for amendment, but you will realise th^tamendment will necessitate further delay, and Parliament rises next week. Grant ofcommissions will be announced at the same time. Kindly reply urgently. Pleasemake official.o
