(a) WITH reference to War Cabinet 208, Minute 2, and war Cabinet 215, Minute 1, the President of the Board of Traderead correspondence which had taken place between him and Mr.Bromley, the&apos; Secretary of the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen (Appendix I). Sir Albert Stanleyexplained that he had written to Mr. Bromley so as to give theUnion an opportunity of coming to the Board of Trade andof putting the men right with the Government and the country.[1365-217] B
,1aMr. Bromley&apos;s reply was uncompromising, and it was desirablethat the Government should be in a position to proclaim under the munitions of War Act a strike, the moment it is known that astrike is about to take place. This would enable the Governmentto attach the funds of the Union, and would make picketing illegal.The case could then go to arbitration by the Committee on production by direction of the Ministry of Labour. Sir albert stanley said that he was against arresting the leaders of thestrike unless there was intimidation and violence. The AssociatedEngineers and Firemen were not absolutely united, and Mr. J. H.Thomas had issued, on behalf of his Union (the National Unionof Railwaymen), a strong circular against the strike, to which hehad received not a single unfavourable reply. The Railway Execu-tive were of opinion that if the National Union of Railwaymenremained firm, it would be possible to convey food, ambulancetrains, some passengers, but the transport of war munitions wouldbe affected.The Minister of Labour believed that the strike would be of short duration, parity owing to the unpopularity of Mr. Bromlejrwith his trade union colleagues, and partly because of the rivalryof the two railway unions mainly concerned.The Minister of Munitions believed that as soon as the publicrealised that the strike would mean a shortage of food at homeand of war supplies abroad, support for the Government wouldrapidly increase.In reply to a question. Sir Albert Stanley explained that the granting of the S-hours&apos; day would now involve the country in an expenditure of 10,000,0007. per annum for increased overtimepay ; the Board of Trade had undertaken that the government control of the railways would continue for some time at leastafter the cessation of hostilities, and an opportunity would begiven to have the hours question discussed. The Board of trade had not refused to discuss the question of increased wages.The War Cabinet decided that Preparations should be made by the Lord President of theCouncil and the Minister of Munitions, in association with the President of the Board of Trade, for the pro-clarnation of the impending strike, and that steps shouldbe taken by the Board of Trade to make clear to thepublic the issues involved.(b.) With reference to the last paragraph in Mr. Bromley&apos;sletter, stating that Scotland Yard officers had sought admission to a conference of the Union, it was stated that two officers hadbeen sent by Scotland Yard to the meeting, under the defence ofthe Realm Act, Regulation 51(b) ; Mr. Bromley had seen theofficers and, after consulting the delegates, had refused to admitthem, and the officers withdrew.The Home Secretary said that this visit had taken place without his knowledge, and he would enquire into it. Liethought the Government had given an undertaking not to applySection 51 (b) to trade union meetings.War Eisks (2). The &quot;War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by insurance. the President of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-1672) on thesubject of War Risks Insurance.Sir Albert Stanley summarised the points referred to in his memorandum. He pointed out that the Government War RisksInsurance scheme for hulls and cargo, which was solvent as awhole till the autumn of last year, has since been steadily losing-money, and at the end of June the estimated deficit on hulls wasabout 13,000,000^., and on cargo about 19,000,000Z. As nearlythe whole of the British Merchant fleet had now been taken over bythe Government, and was at the risk of the Government, the
insurance cf the ships themselves could, for the moment, be put on one side. But some alteration must be made in the scheme forthe insurance of cargo. Under the present scheme all the betterrisks were going to the open market, while the bad risks and the big risks which the market could not take were being left withthe Government.The only way in which unnecessary loss and waste could be prevented was for the Government in effect to take over the wholewar risk insurance of the country. The leaders of the Londoninsurance market had been sounded, and recognised that some-thing of this kind was inevitable. It was therefore proposedthat the Board of Trade should make an arrangement with theinsurance market under which, after a certain date, no war riskswill be written by anyone in the United Kingdom except throughone central body acting on behalf of the Government.Sir Albert Stanley said that, as this proposal involved a radical departure, he wished to haA&apos;e the instructions of theCabinet.The Board of Trade and Treasury being in agreement, theWar Cabinet approved Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s scheme in principle,but requested him, before putting it in operation, to confer withthe leading underAvriters in the matter.Custody of WarCabinetDocuments.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the Secretary (Paper G.T.-1710) on the subject of the ultimatecustody of the Cabinet documents issued to Ministers(Appendix II).The War Cabinet agreed with the Secretary, for the reasonspointed out in his memorandum, as to the importance of haA-ingsecret documents returned b)- Ministers Avhen they go out of office.It Avas pointed out that the danger Avas not confined to thepossibility of Cabinet documents getting into the hands of foreigners, as, for instance, in the case of an ex-Cabinet Ministerhaving a Avife of foreign extraction who might be his executrix,and who might elect to reside in the country of her birth, for there was also a risk of Cabinet papers finding their way intosale-rooms and second-hand book-shops, as had occurred in thepast. In fact, if precautions were not taken, the Avhole innerhistory of the Avar would, in a few years&quot; time, leak out through these means. It /was probably impossible for Ministers to handback the Avhole of the vast mass of their papers, but it would bewell if the Secretary could make a list of the more secret papers and get them returned from Ministers when they vacate office.The Prime Minister referred to the importance of constant-reference to previous papers, and the War Cabinet agreed thatthere should be no question of a Minister returning cabinet documents during his term of office.The War Cabinet, Avho approved of the Secretary&apos;s sugges-tions in principle, decided that (a.) Cabinet documents should he the property of HisMaje&apos;sty&apos;s Government, and that the Cabinet shouldhave the right to insist on the return of any confidential -tial GoA^ernment document.(&amp;.) This arrangement should date from the formation of thepresent Government in December 1916, when for thefirst time records of Cabinet meetings were kept.(c.) An ex-Minister should at any time be allowed to have access at the War Cabinet offices to Cabinet docu-ments to Avhich he had had access during the timewhen he Avas in office.(d.) Upon leaving office, the normal course should be for a minister to hand OA^er his papers to his successor, and
that these documents should be regarded as the pro-perty of- the office, and not of the individual.(e.) The Secretary, in conjunction with Lord Curzon, should -prepare a list of certain specified documents (includ-ing War Cabinet Minutes and Imperial War cabinet minutes of great secrecy, which, if not handed overto his successor, should be returned by a Minister onvacating office.(/.) It should be the- duty of the Secretary to collect such documents&quot; from ex-Ministers as are not handed overto their successors.(g.) In future, all War Cabinet documents, whether printedor otherwise, should contain a statement that &apos;&apos; this document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment.The Western Front. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence gave particulars inregard to the attack to the North of Ypres. Two French and eightBritish divisions had attacked on a front of about eleven miles.They had been opposed by a force of nine German divisions. Onthe left the attack had been completely successful, and all the objectives gained. On the right, however, there had been strong opposition, and counter-attacks had been delivered by the enemy..The enemy still occupied the high ground, but we had made good progress as far as just to the East of St. Julien. We had taken1,800 prisoners, but, owing to the nature of the ground, it is not tobe expected that the numbers of prisoners will be as large as inthe Somme and Arras regions. In the latter districts prisoners had been taken in dug-outs, but in the wet ground near Ypresthis was not possible. The proportion of killed to prisoners atYpres was probably much greater.In the Lens area three Canadian divisions, who had capturedHill 70, had been opposed by three German divisions.The weather on the Western front was bad.Casualties. 5. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that our casualties in the Ypres fighting had amounted to roughly 9,000;namely, 432 officers and about 8,600 men. Our casualties sincethe 31st July numbered 1,176 officers and 45,000 other ranks.German reserves. ^ 6. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that onesatisfactory feature of the recent fighting appeared to be that theGerman reserves showed signs of weakening. There were only,twelve fresh divisions on the Western front. Since we began ourattack on the 31st July, only one German division, namely theAlpine Corps from Alsace, had been sent to Russia. Since thebeginning of the Russian attack on the 1st July, eight divisions had been sent.German Desertions. 7. The Director of Military Intelligence pointed out recentcases of desertion on the part of the enemy, indicating deterioration-tion of -moral in certain units. In the 208th German Division,composed of Prussian-troops, at Verdun, on the left bank of theMeuse, a whole, platoon of 40 men had deserted, and yesterdayanother batch of 70 men had deserted.The Eastern Front. 8. The Director of Military Intelligence reported a telegramfrom Paris saying that General Weygand was of opinion that theGerman effort against Russia was coming to an end, apparentlyfrom lack of troops. General Ballard had sent similar news, tothe effect that the enemy&apos;s attack was weaker, and that he wasentrenching.
Austrian Troops. 9. The War Cabinet took note of the possibly significant factthat only one Austrian Division took part in&quot; the attack onRoumania.East Africa. 10. The Director of Military Intelligence reported a message from General van Deventer, to the effect that the enemy had abandoned his pom-poms and was retreating southwards, andthat our troops were in pursuit.russia. 11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a telegramfrom General Barter to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,dated the 12th August, 1917 (Paper G.T.-1705), in which thesuggestion was made that the Allied Powers should put pressure on the Russian Government to carry out General Korniloffsconditions of accepting his appointment (War Cabinet 208,Minute 6), one of which was that the application of disciplinarymeasures and death penalty should be extended to all troops in theEmpire.The War Cabinet felt it would be unwise to put pressure onthe Russian Government to adopt General Korniloffs full programme, because it might be said that the British Governmentwere urging the Russian Government to shoot soldiers. such advice, it was pointed out, by an Allied Government, would, in similar circumstances, be strongly resented by a BritishGovernment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out thedelicacy of the situation having regard to Russian psychology, ofwhich matter our Ambassador was the best judge.It was pointed out that some careful message in support of discipline might be sent to Sir G. Buchanan, to be used at his discretion and after consultation with the representatives of theAllies.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to draft a message in this sense which he would submit to thePrime Minister for approval.International 12. With reference to War Cabinet 200, Minute 11, the First-Naval Conference.    Sea Lord reported that Admiral Sims had received a telegram tothe effect that Admiral Mayo and his Staff were sailing on the18th. August in the steamship &quot; St. Louis &quot; to take part in theNaval Conference,f 1365-217] X&apos; OGeneral Ballard also reported that the Russians wereexpecting an attack on the Bessarabia frontier between theDneister and the Pruth, but there was, so far as he was aware, no particular concentration in this quarter.At Okna the 2nd Roumanian Army were maintaining their position well. General Ballard reported that in the recent fighting the good point was that the Russians and Roumanianshad put up a stout fight; the bad point was that mutual distrustand friction continued. General Ballard suggested that arousing telegram should be sent to the King of Roumania. TheWar Cabinet approved this suggestion, and asked The War Office to supply the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs with materials for a telegram which the Secretaryof State would, on behalf of the War Cabinet, advise his Majesty to send to the King of Roumania.
Decoy Ships. 13. The First Sea Lord reported four cases in which special service Ships, formerly known as Decoy or &quot; Q &quot; ships, had been lost. He stated that the day of the Special Service Vesselappeared to be over. Two of these ships, the &quot; Prize &quot; and the&quot; Bergamo,&quot; had been sunk off the North-West of Ireland. He -gave particulars of. the action and the ultimate loss of one of these special Seryice Vessels, which had fought a particularly gallantfight with a submarine. The Officer in Command of the ship had already received the V.C. and two D.S.O&apos;s. . While, owing tothe secret nature of the craft, it would be impossible to publish the details, the War Cabinet asked The First Sea Lord to express to the Officer commanding theship the appreciation of the War Cabinet for the gallantconduct of all concerned.Attack on GermanMinesweepers.14. The First Sea Lord reported that Commodore (T) had attacked a number of German Minesweepers, and, he thinks,sunk .two of them, and damaged a destroyer. On his return hecaptured. a Dutch ship carrying coal from Rotterdam, outside territorial waters.       .Aerial operations against Belgium.15. The First Sea Lord reported that a successful bombingraid had been carried out at Ostend and Ghistelles, where the aerodromes and railway stations had been heavily bombed. Anenemy two-seater had been driven down. All our own machines had returned safely..Stockholm 16- The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegramConference. No.   1258,   dated  the  15th August,  1917,  from  Sir GeorgeBuchanan, with reference to complications which have arisen inPetrograd as a result of the correspondence between the PrimeMinister : and Mr. Arthur Henderson on the subject of the stockholm Conference, and of the action taken by the RussianMinister in London.jt was pointed out that neither in the correspondence withMr. Henderson nor in his statement in the House of Commons hadthe Prime Minister stated that M. Kerensky was opposed to the holding of the Conference.With reference to a suggestion put to Sir George Buchananby some journalists that the Russian Government should requestHis Majesty&apos;s Government to allow British Socialists to attend the Stockholm Conference, it was urged that it was most undesirable that any such request should be made. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Allied Governments of France, Italy and theUnited States, had to consider public opinion in their respective countries,, just as the Russian Government had to consider publicopinion in Russia.The &quot;War Cabinet agreed that the Naval Conference shouldbe held on Tuesday, the 4th September, and instructed The  Admiralty  to  issue invitations to the Allies to send representatives, at the time informing them that Admiral *Mayo  and  Admiral  Sims will represent the UnitedStates of America.This Naval Conference must be distinguished from theTransport Conference, which would probably not take place (WarCabinet 208, Minute 3).
The action of M. Nabokoff had been fully considered by theWar Cabinet on the 13th August, and it was important to adhere to the undertaking then given (War Cabinet 213, Minute 14).Mr. Philip Kerr was requested to draft a telegram on theabove lines to Sir George Buchanan, for submission tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.British Policy inPalestine: Issue ofProclamation bythe G.O.C.-in-Chief,Egyptian   Expedi-tionary Force.17. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the secretary of State for War (Paper G.T. 1720) statingthat General Allenby had telegraphed to say that it would benecessary for him to issue from time to time proclamations in occupied enemy territory, and that it would guide and assist him in drafting such proclamations if he were clearly informed as tothe policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to Palestine.Sir Mark Sykes pointed out that this contingency had beenforeseen and provided for before he himself assumed the dutiesof Chief Political Officer to the Expeditionary Force. A documententitled &quot; The Status and Functions of the Chief Political officer and French Commissioner &quot; had been prepared and approved bythe British and French Governments, which clearly defined theposition and duties of those two officers. It was possible thatGeneral Allenby was not aware of the existence of this document.General Allenby had, however, attached to his Staff, as ChiefPolitical Officer, General Clayton, who had succeeded Sir MarkSykes, and who Avould always be consulted in the first instancewhere matters of policy were involved.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should inform the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief Egypt, that, so far as political considerations were concerned, he had authorityto issue Proclamations without reference to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as prescribed in the instructions to theChief Political Officer; and that, in all cases of military necessity or urgency, he had a free hand.18. The War Cabinet had a discussion on General Murray*despatch of the 28th June, 1917.It was pointed out that the first paragraph of the Reportgave a somewhat misleading impression of vacillation in the;War Cabinefs policy, insomuch as it merely reproduced the gist of telegrams from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, someof which were based on War Cabinet decisions. Without asummary of the data on which those decisions were based, whichwere not the concern of General Sir Archibald Murray, thissummary conveyed an inaccurate impression. It was further pointed out that other portions of the despatch might be of great value to the enemy, and handicap the future operations of theEgyptian Expeditionary Force.The War Cabinet decided that (a) In any case, the first part of the despatch, dealing withpolicy, could not be published.(&amp;) The despatch as a whole should be remitted to the WarOffice for further and drastic revision, in the light ofcontemplated future operations.Sir ArchibaldMurray&apos;s Despatchon the recent operations of theEgyptian   Expedi-tionary Force.
Supplies.Pensions for teachers.19. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by Mr.Prothero on the desirability of the British Government securingsupplies of frozen fish from Newfoundland and CanadianCompanies at an agreed price and subject to inspection, for theperiod of the war and for a year or eighteen months afterwards(Paper G.T.-1709).The War Cabinet agreed that the proposals appeared on the surface to be sound, and referred them for full examination andreport to the following Committee : The Food Controller (Chairman),A Representative of the Board of   Agriculture   andFisheries,A Representative of the Ministry of Shipping,A Representative of the Board of Trade,A Representative of the Colonial Office,A Representative of the Treasury,Mr. Thomas Jones (Secretary).20. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum on pensions for Teachers, by the President of the Board of Education (PaperMr. Fisher thought that the establishment of a scheme ofpensions for Secondary and Technical School Teachers already authorised by the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 75, Minute 10)would be certain to lead to a demand for similar arrangementsfor Elementary School Teachers. It was desirable that allteachers should be covered, as this would not only improve the attractions of the profession but make mobility between thedifferent grades more frequent. . In Germany the pension of the teacher was equal to his salary on retirement; there was thereforelittle difficulty in retiring a man. He suggested that the scheme might provide for pensions equivalent to two-thirds of the salary,and for a retiring age at 60, and he estimated the additional contribution of the State would be about one million pounds perannum if Elementary Teachers were included.The War Cabinet were impressed with the importance of raising the quality of the teaching profession and removing from it all reasonable cause of discontent, inasmuch as at presentrevolutionary movements were to no small extent fomented bydissatisfied school teachers.The War Cabinet decided To approve in principle the recommendations of thePresident of the Board of Education in favour of aPensions system for Elementary Teachers, subject to theagreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W,,G.T.-1601).August 17, 1917.
APPENDIX I.Railway Labour Unrest.Correspondence between the President of the Board of Trade and the Secretaryof the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.Dear Mr. Bromley, August 15, 1917.I HEREWITH enclose a copy of question and answer which was given in theHouse of Commons yesterday, and which I feel it my duty to communicate to you inorder that your Delegates may be under no misapprehension as to the serious view the Government take with regard to any stoppage of the railways. Having regardto the fact that Parliament is about to adjourn for the autumn recess, members willvery naturally expect a statement of the latest development before the adjournment,and, what is &quot;more important, an intimation, if possible, that having regard to thegreat crisis through which the nation is passing, no attempt to hamper or interferewith our efforts will be made by any section of railwaymen. If, therefore, you can give me such intimation, it will be welcomed by the House and the country, andI am satisfied that such a course will ultimately prove to the best interest of the menwhen the time comes to discuss questions of shorter working days.I should, therefore, be obliged if you have any communication to make that itmay reach me in time so that 1 may be able to communicate with Parliament to-day.Yours very truly,(Signed) A. H.&apos; STANLEY.J. Bromley, Esq.Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen,8, Park Square, Leeds.Grafton Hotel,Tottenham Court Road, London, W. 1.Dear Sir Albert, August 16, 1917.I HAVE received your favour of yesterday&apos;s elate delivered to me by hand to-day. *I quite appreciate the desire of the Government to be enabled to assure theHouse of Commons and the country that there will be no trouble on the railways asa result of the refusal to concede to the railway locomotivemen the principle of the 8-liour day, but unfortunately I regret to say that the very reverse will be the casein the very immediate future unless the above principle is conceded to the railwaylocomotivemen of the country.Your letter has been submitted to our Conference of Delegates now sitting,and I am instructed to assure you that the minds of the locomotivemen are made up.We have endeavoured by every means in our powder to come to an amicable settlement, having failed to do so, there is but one course open to us.I may say that we have ample evidence to lead us to believe that yourself andthe Railway Executive Committee have been very much deceived as to the determinedstrength in the country behind our demand, and possibly as to the power of others to control the loconiotivemen, that however is no fault of ours, and if any belief inour want of the strongest support, not only from our own members, has beenengendered, we can only regret it.I may respectfully assure you that we are prepared for any and everyeventuality wdiich may arise, when the final step is taken.I regret I cannot give you a different reply, but the very serious nature of theposition demands the greatest frankness.* The first paragraph of Mr. Bromley&apos;s letter is due to a mistake in the date at the top of Sir Albert.Stanley&apos;s letter, which should have been dated the Kith August.- [1385-217] D
I am sorry to inform you that this reply to your letter has been delayed owing to scotland Yard officers seeking admission to our Conference which however the delegates refused. I think I ought to say that if our Conference is interfered withby the Authorities, the stoppage of work will be precipitated without any furtheract by ourselves.Yours faithfully,(Signed) J. BROMLEY, General Secretary.Sir Albert Stanley,President of Board of Trade,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.APPENDIX II.G.T.-1710. -The Custody of War Cabinet Documents.Note by the Secretary.AN important question of principle as to the ultimate custody of War cabinet documents issued to Ministers is raised by the resignation of Mr. Henderson andMr. Austen Chamberlain.2. I am informed that the immemorial custom has been for Cabinet documents to remain the personal property of Cabinet Ministers on their vacating office. I feel it my duty, however, to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the fact that thereare many differences between the peace conditions in which this practice grew up andthose under which the present War Cabinet works.3. In the first place it must be remembered that before the war nearly all papersdealing with national defence, foreign policy, and kindred subjects, were issued bythe Committee of Imperial Defence. By a decision of that Committee taken onthe 14th May, 1908 (Minutes of the 99th Meeting) (Appendix) all papers issuedwere subsequently to be returned to the Secretary, the only exception being in the caseof a very limited number of Permanent Officials in the Admiralty, War Office,Treasury, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and India Office. By the same decisionex-Members of the Committee were allowed access to C.I.D. Papers prepared during their term of membership. Considerable use has been made of this latter provision.Now, however, the War Cabinet has absorbed the Committee of Imperial Defence,so that a very large category, of highly secret papers is issued to Members, documentscorresponding to which in times of peace would, by the rules of the Committee, havebeen returned to the Secretary. Before the war a.small organisation was maintained in the Committee of Imperial Defence for ensuring the recovery of documents, and inthe vast majority of cases they were, in fact, recovered.4. The second new factor is that, probably for the first time in the history ofthe country, certainly for many decades, Cabinet Minutes are kept. This introducesa new class of document in which many very secret matters are dealt with.5. Thirdly, the number of documents issued to the War Cabinet is very much larger than it was before the war. For example, I calculate on a rough estimate thatMr. Arthur Henderson must have not much less than 1,500 documents. It must beremembered also that the War Cabinet has always made a very great point of receiving the fullest information from all Departments. Anyone who has beenthrough the war from its commencement up to the present time knows that there isno comparison between the amount of secret information placed at the disposal ofthe War Cabinet now, and before the present Government assumed office. This initself is a strong argument for the adoption of special measures to ensure secrecy.If the Admiralty, War Office, and Foreign Office believe there is a danger of theirsecrets leaking out they will be so much the more reluctant to give frank and full information.6. Finally, the importance of secrecy in time of war is greater than in time ofpeace. In. the aggregate the War Cabinet documents contain very complete informa-tion on nearly every aspect of our war policy and aims.7. I am particularly anxious not to suggest for one moment that any cabinet minister, past or present, would be so indiscreet as deliberately or unintentionally toallow national secrets to leak out, or to permit unauthorised persons to have access
to secret documents. Every Cabinet Minister is bound by his Privy Councillorsoath to &quot; keep secret all matters committted and revealed unto me or that shallbe treated of secretly in Council.&quot;This is not the danger to be apprehended. There are, however, other risks. when an ex-Cabinet Minister dies his secret papers become the property of his executors.These are bound by no Privy Councillor&apos;s oath, and are not necessarily persons of thesame discretion as the Cabinet Minister himself. It is easy to imagine a good manycases in which information in Cabinet documents might leak out, whether by accidentor design, without any technical infringement of the Official Secrets Act. Forexample, there might be a case of an ex-Cabinet Minister having a wife of foreignextraction who would become his executrix and might elect, to reside in the country of her birth, in which case the documents would pass with her beyond the control ofthe Government.8. There is therefore I submit, a strong case for re-consideration of the wholequestion. Elaborate precautions are taken in this and other offices to preventleakage. To allow national secrets to pass beyond the control of the Government is seriously to impair the value of these precautions.9. From the point of view of the Secretariat of the War Cabinet, the only reallysatisfactory decision would be to apply to the War Cabinet the rules of theCommittee of Imperial Defence (Appendix), that is to say, to insist on the return ofall Cabinet documents, subject to the right of ex-Ministers to have access to thoseprepared during their term of membership. The Minutes of the late War Committeehad printed upon them the following notice &quot; To be returned to The Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.&quot;In the first month of the War Cabinet&apos;s existence the same notice was printed on war Cabinet Minutes. The difficulties of obtaining recovery, however, provedinsuperable, both in the case of the War Committee and the War Cabinet, and thenotice, which had no Government sanction beyond the decision of the Committee ofImperial Defence, which was not strictly applicable, was abandoned.10. If the &quot;War Cabinet cannot see their way to approving this drastic solution,I would at least ask for authority to take the following action in the case of all WarCabinet Ministers going out of office: (1.) To ask them to return certain specified documents of great secrecy. In this category would be included: Minutes of the War Cabinet; documents ofthe War Policy Committee; documents dealing with naval, military, andforeign policy; Terms of Peace; any documents containing unpara-phrased cipher telegrams, and others which I am not in a position to specify until I have carefully scrutinised the list of documents furnished to Mr. Henderson and Mr. Austen Chamberlain. In asking for thereturn of these documents it is proposed, subject to the approval of theWar Cabinet, to state that the outgoing Cabinet Minister can have access to any document issued to him during his term of office;(2.) To ask that the outgoing Cabinet Minister should make such testamentarvdispositions as would provide for the immediate return of the documents-to the Secretary on his demise.11. It is necessary to draw a distinction between a Member of the War Cabinet.,such as Mr. Henderson, and a member of the Government outside the War Cabinet,such as Mr. Austen Chamberlain. I understand that Mr. Chamberlain considers thatthe War Cabinet Minutes and other documents are his personal property, although he has lent them temporarily to his successor. I would submit that the intention ofthe War Cabinet in their decision of the 12th December last, to issue copies of theWar Cabinet Minutes and other documents to certain Ministers was to send themfor the use of the office and not for the individual. The War Cabinet Minute on thesubject designates the persons to whom Minutes are sent by their official titles andnot by name.12. Every case, however, will be provided for if the War Cabinet can see their way to adopt the rules of the Committee of Imperial Defence which are attached in
the Appendix. I would most strongly urge, as the result of 9 years&apos; experienceunder very varying conditions, that this course should be adopted. Failing this, Iwould ask (a.) For authority to take the action referred to in paragraph 10 in the case ofoutgoing members of the War Cabinet; and(&amp;.) For a decision that War Cabinet documents supplied to members of theGovernment, who are not members of the War Cabinet, should beregarded as the property of the office and not of the individual.    *(Initialled) M.
