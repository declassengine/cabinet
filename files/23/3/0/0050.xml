Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary.Mr. arthur henderson&apos;s visit to Paris :The stockholm conference.PRIOR to Mr. Henderson&apos;s arrival, the other members ofthe War Cabinet discussed the question among themselves, incontinuation of the meeting held on the same morning (WarCabinet 201 a). Mr. Henderson demurred to this procedure, ashe was invited to attend at 4&quot;30 and had waited one hour, andeven, then was not invited into the Cabinet, but it was explainedthat it had been adopted with special regard to Mr. Henderson&apos;interest and feelings, and that no slight had been intended. Therewas some discussion as to the nature of the answers which hadbeen given in the House of Commons to questions in regard toMr. Hendersons visit to Paris. Mr. Henderson considered thatthese had given a somewhat misleading impression of the wholetransaction, more especially because they omitted all reference to thediscussion that had taken place at the War Cabinet on the afternoon of Thursday, the 26th July. He pointed out that this had been particularly marked in the abbreviated versions that had beentelegraphed to Paris, and these had given rise to considerableComment among the French.Mr. Henderson reminded the War Cabinet that the question ofthe Stockholm Conference had never been discussed by those whowere specially entitled to a view in the matter, namely, the AlliedSocialist Parties. The proposal had originally been made by theRussian Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Committee without conference with their Allies. The policy of the British Labour Party towardsit had been to postpone it as long as possible ; in fact, they had adopted precisely the same attitude towards it as that of theGovernment towards the Russian Governments proposals for aGovernment Conference on War Aims.
Mr. Henderson recalled that, before he had left England, the WarCabinet themselves had agreed that if a Conference at Stockholmwas held at all it would be advisable that British representatives should be present (War Cabinet 141, Minute 1.5). circumstances had, he admitted, changed considerably since then, but until he methis colleagues he had no information that their attitude on thesubject had changed.He himself had returned from Petrograd somewhat under theinfluence of the daily discussions he had had with the RussianForeign Secretary, who had insisted very strongly, and almost up tothe moment of his departure, on the great importance that theRussian Government attached to the holding of the stockholm conference as a means of clearing away the siispicions that existed in Russia of British Imperialistic designs. The Russian Governmenthad wished the Stockholm Conference te precede the GovernmentConference on War Aims, their reason being that an Allied SocialistConference, as proposed by the British Labour Party, would not exercise any influence on the Governments concerned, whereas they considered that the Stockholm Conference would.Owing to the inability of the British Government to send awarship to bring him back from Norway. Mr. Henderson said thathe had been delayed three or four da3Ts on his journey, with the resultthat the Prime Minister had left for Paris before he reached London.On his arrival he had found himself confronted with an invitation from the French Socialists to the Russian Socialists and the british labour Party to proceed at once to Paris to discuss the AlliedSocialist Conference and the Stockholm Conference. Before he had met his colleagues in the War Cabinet, he had had to attend ameeting of the British Labour Party&apos;s Executive, and at this meetingit had been decided to accept the invitation of the French socialists and to proceed to Paris, and Mr. Henderson himself, as Secretary ofthe British Labour Party&apos;s Executive, together, with Mr. ramsay macdonald, the Treasurer, and Mr. Wardle had been selected as representatives. Immediately this decision was reached, he had telegraphed it direct to the Prime Minister at Paris, and on the afternoon of the following day he had met his colleagues and franklydiscussed the whole question with them at the War Cabinet.Mr. Henderson justified his acceptance of a nomination to go to paris by pointing out that, as the Russian Socialists had accepted, itwas eminently desirable that British representatives should alsoattend. Further, as Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, as Treasurer of theBritish Labour Party&apos;s Executive, was selected, it was desirable thatthose who held different views from him should be represented.At Paris the Stockholm Conference had been discussed as amatter that was already settled in principle, and Mr. Hendersonhimself had taken the line which he had decided on his return fromRussia to be best calculated to promote the national interests, thatis to say 1. To postpone the Stockholm Conference as long as possible.2. To do his utmost to ensure that it should not be a conference to take decisions, but merely a consultation at which theBritish and French delegates could expound the Britishand French case.At Paris he had stood out against the Russian and FrenchSocialists for this point of view. The French had wished the socialist parties of the various nations to be bound by the decisions of theConference, because they had thought that by these means theycould secure French aims in regard to Alsace and Lorraine. he himself, however, had explained that Great Britain was confronted with special difficulties in the matter of war aims, and that theBritish Labour Party could not permit themselves to be bound bythe decisions of the Conference.    He had stated that he would
have to reconsider his position in regard to the Conference if he found the resolutions were to be binding, and eventually he had succeeded in securing the adoption of his point of view. He had also succeeded in obtaining the postponement of the Conference fromthe 15th August to the 10th September in order to give time forthe representatives of the United States Labour Party to attend theAllied Conference that was to precede the Stockholm Conference.On the question as to whether he himself, if selected by theBritish Labour Party to attend the Stockholm Conference, could accept nomination, Mr. Henderson urged that he could not give animmediate answer. He had always realised that it would be verydifficult for him to proceed to Stockholm as a Member of the british war Cabinet. Consequently, if he should receive a nomination forthe Conference, he would have to reconsider the wdiole positionaccording to circumstances. By that time, he pointed out. thesituation might have entirely changed, as, indeed, it had alreadychanged since the War Cabinet itself was inclined to favour british representation if a Conference should be held at Stockholm.The War Cabinet then discussed with Mr. Henderson theimmediate Parliamentary situation. It was generally agreed thatthe House of Commons was less concerned in the stockholm conference than in the fact that Mr. Henderson, a Member of theWar Cabinet, had proceeded to Paris in company with Mr. ramsay macdonald, who only a clay or two before had made himselfconspicuous as the leader of the pacifist group in the debate on war aims.It was generally agreed that Mr. Henderson could dispose of criticism in the House of Commons by pointing out that the difficulty had arisen from the fact that he held a dual position as a Memberof the War Cabinet and as Secretary of the Executive Committeeof the British Labour Party. It might be frankly admitted that,on the present occasion, this had entailed some misunderstanding,but it must be borne in mind that it also possessed great-advantages. It had enabled Mr. Henderson in the past to keep inthe closest possible touch with the views of the Labour Party, andso, by first-hand information, to assist the Government in preparingits war measures on lines which would be acceptable to labour. Moreover, it had enabled- Mr. Henderson to attend the previous Conferences of Allied Socialists with good results.For example, only last Christmas he had attended a SocialistConference in Paris, Avhere he had met with considerable opposition, but had eventually induced the Conference to take theview which he shared with the British Government in regard to the prosecution of the war. Further, he could point out that membersof the French and other Allied Governments occupied a positionsimilar to his own. On balance, therefore, the dual nature of hisposition had been an advantage. Mr. Henderson could also remindParliament that this was not the first Conference which he had attended in company with Mr. Bamsay Macdonald. It was true hehad not been with him to Paris before, but he had travelled withhim to Manchester. In fact, as Secretary of the Executive Com-mittee of the British Labour Party, he could not refuse to take partin official missions in company with its treasurer. This was an inevitable part of his dual position already referred to. Moreover,neither he nor Mr. Ramsay Macdonald had any illusions as to theviews which each held with regard to the war.By taking some such line as tins, and by combining it with astrong war speech, on the lines of the speech he had made to theComite Parlementaire d&apos;Action a 1&apos;Etranger in Paris, it was feltthat Mr. Henderson should succeed in satisfying the House of&quot;Commons.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 2, 1917. :.
