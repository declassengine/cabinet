APPENDIX.Coal for Italy.(Strictly Confidential.) British Embassy, Rome, July 20, 1917.My dear Wyldbore-Smitli,I AM very sorry to seem to worry you again about the coal question in Italy, forI know that I am speaking to the converted, and in this particular case the convertedhas also been one of the chief champions of the cause. However, I know that you liketo be thoroughly posted in a matter which I am certain? as I have always been certain,constitutes the pivot on which Italian resistance turns.Commander Riccardo Bianchi, who, as you know, has now been made Minister of transports in the attempt to save a highly difficult situation, asked me to go and see him yesterday. He told me that for the month of April about 300,000 tons of coal had come from England, plus 9,000 from Blave. In May the corresponding figures were430,000 and 12,000, and in June 315,000&quot;and 30,000. His estimate for the month ofJuly is 390,000 from the two sources.The stocks of coal in Italy on the 1st July were only about 300,000 tons from all sources in the entire kingdom. Of these, 200,000 tons were for the railways, viz., lessthan the consumption for a month. Of the remaining 100,000 tons, 50,000 were stillon the wharves or being discharged, and wrere for the Gas and Metallurgical Companies.The remaining 50,000 tons wrere in the various factories working for the Government,and represented only one-fifth of the monthly consumption.With regard to the consumption of the railways, the Minister said it was impossibleto effect a further reduction. The passenger traffic has been cut down by 50 per cent.,but the economy so obtained is more than eaten up by the increased consumption ofthe goods traffic. This is due to the fact that this traffic is almost entirely for military purposes. Soldiers have to be carried throughout the length and breadth of Italy,with all their accoutrements, provisions, and ammunition. The provisions cannot any longer be taken from the nearest market in consequence of the scarcity. AYood has tobe conveyed from the forests of Calabria regardless of expense, other things have to betaken where they can be found. Besides this, it must be remembered that allcommercial navigation is suspended along the Adriatic coast, and that the towns alldown the eastern side of Italy could not exist unless they were provisioned by landtransport from the west. Cadorna had asked him for an amount of coal which he,the Minister, with his vast experience as Director of State Railways, thought to be only 75 per cent, of the proper amount that should be at the front to meet emergencies.Given, howrever, the present dearth of coal, he vvas not even able to supply him withthis 75 per cent., and he said that if the Austrians knew this, and were able to makealternative attacks in force on the two extremities of the Trentino and the Carso, thematter might be extremely serious.Unless during the next four months more coal could be sent out in the proportionsthat w*e both know, he said that he did not know how resistance would be possible,and that he trembled to think of the winter inasmuch, as the&quot; cold, as every engineerknows, entails a far larger consumption of coal for effecting the same object, whetherit be the driving of a locomotive or the smelting of iron, than is required when the temperature is high.I send you the conversation and, as you know, am convinced as to its truth. Itwould be impossible to find anywdiere a more capable man as Minister of Transportsthan Riccardo Bianchi, but, great organiser though he is, he cannot make brickswithout straw. Everything is being done to help the situation. The woods, includingolive groves, are being cut clown without mercy. The small amount of lignite which exists is being worked to its fullest extent. But it is impossible to smelt iron withlignite or with wood, and it is impossible to drive anything but the slowest trains withthem for which in fact they are being used, with great detriment to the rolling stock.Can you again see if it is possible to get any more ships ? Knowing thedifficulties of the situation as well as I know them, 1 should not write to you unless considered the matter as serious from our point of view as Italy&apos;s Allies as it is possiblefor any matter to be.Yours ever,(Signed) E. CAPEL CURE.o
