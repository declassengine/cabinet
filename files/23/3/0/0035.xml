The GunAmmunitionProgramme for1918.Financial Positionin Canada.Orders for munitions in theUnited States of1. THE War Cabinet considered the proposals of the Ministryof Munitions for the gun ammunition programme for the year 1918,with, special reference to the supply of ammunition to be obtainedfrom Canada (Paper G.T.-1365).Dr. Addison explained that, from a manufacturing point ojtview, the execution of this programme would present no difficulty,with the possible exception of the supply of the ammunition for-inch Howitzers, for which there was an ever-increasing demand.In regard to these weapons, the Army were asking for 1,965 piecesfor the year 1918, as compared with the existing number of about 900,and the Minister of Munitions hoped to be able to produce a totalof 1,480 by March, and 1,665 by April, 1918. The production ofammunition for so large a number of weapons, however, wouldrequire great quantities of steel, and it was only possible to obtainthis amount of steel, consistently with the release of that metalurgently required for shipbuilding, by placing the orders abroad,more particularly in the United States of America and Canada.The War Cabinet first discussed the programme from the pointof view of whether so large a production was essential, and it wassuggested that, in framing it, possibly insufficient allowance hadbeen made for the enforced reduction in the expenditure ofammunition that would occur during the winter months. Dr. Addisonand the Master-General of the Ordnance, however, explained thatthis factor had been fully discounted in their calculations.2. The Minister of Munitions made it clear that the executionof the above programme of ammunition supply, and particularly ofthe programme for 6-inch Howitzer ammunition, would involve an expenditure in Canada next year of 33,000,000 dollars a month ascompared with the present expenditure of 40,000,000 dollars amonth. Having regard to the difficulty already experienced infinancing Canadian purchases, which subject had already beenunder discussion by the War Cabinet on the 5th July (WarCabinet 176, Minute 2), the Minister of Munitions felt bound to consult the War Cabinet in the matter.On the financial side, Sir Robert Chalmers stated that theposition, briefly, was that, while we might be able to pull throughinlhe United States of America, we certainly could not do so at the */p*es3Bl rate in Canada. He pointed out that, from a financial pointof view, it was necessary to confine orders placed in Canada withinthe limits of the funds at our disposal, and that these funds had toprovide not only for ammunition, but also for food, &amp;c. He hoped thatwe might be able to finance our actual commitments up to September1917, with the exception of the new commitments entered into bythe Ministry of Food, for which he could see no funds available.The War Cabinet decided that Before fixing on the extent of the curtailment of the proposedmunitions programme (if any), the Prime Minister should send a telegram to Sir Robert Borden, restating theposition frankly, &quot;and pointing out that the failure ofCanada to provide financial facilities would result in anentire cessation of orders.3. The War Cabinet authorised The Minister of Munitions to initiate action with a view toapproaching the United States Government for the purposeof obtaining permission to order 100,000 rounds of 6-inchHowitzer shell a week in that country, though it was recognised that, if financial difficulties in Canada couldnot be satisfactorily overcome, it might be necessary toplace much larger orders in the United States.
The FinancialPosition in theUnited States ofAmerica.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinetthat the financial situation of the Allies in the United States wasscarcely less menacing than it was in Canada ; and in thisconnection the attention of the&apos; War Cabinet was drawn to a personal telegram, dated the 14th July, from the british ambassador at Washington.The War Cabinet approved the despatch of a reply in thefollowing sense : &quot; Your personal telegram about the financial situation isin the highest degree alarming. We have from the first giventhe Allies all the financial assistance necessary to them, and during past four months our assistance has been on as great a scale as hitherto. We are still supporting whole burden,including United States expenditure of Russia and Belgium,and aid required from us by Italy and France has not diminishedin spite of aid given by United States Government, owing totheir growing financial exhaustion, especially France. Duringpast three weeks we have had to furnish France withi,000,000Z. a day to support her exchange and other expenditurehere. We are at the end of our resources for payments inAmerica, and if purchases there cannot be met by the UnitedStates Government the whole financial fabric - of the Alliancewill break down. This message is sent after consideration bythe Cabinet, and a copy is being given to Mr. Page. If this financial breakdown should occur, it would be a deadly and perhaps a fatal blow to the Allies&apos; cause.&quot;Proposed telegram to Lord ISTorthcliffe.5. The War Cabinet decided that A comprehensive telegram should be drafted in the secretariat of the War Cabinet, in conjunction with the PrimeMinisters Secretariat, for the Prime Minister to send toLord Northcliffe. This telegram should set forth a fulland reasoned statement of the present position as affectingthe United States of America in regard to finance,munitions, food, and the Naval and Military situationsgenerally.British Assistanceto Russia.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Minute byLord Milner, a letter from the Russian General Hermonius toLord Milner, and a telegram from the British Ambassador at petrograd, No. 1033, dated the 6th July, on the subject of british assistance to Russia (Paper G.T.-1376). The Shipping Controllerpointed out that, owing to the labour situation at Archangel, the capacity of that port might also be a limiting factor as to theamount of cargo that could be handled.In view of the success that had attended the recent russian offensive, the War Cabinet approved Lord milner&apos;s proposal that The Shipping Controller should raise the amount of tonnageallotted to Russia from 150,000 to 208,000 tons, providedhe was satisfied that the port of Archangel couldaccommodate the traffic,and decided that The general question of sending more munitions to russia should be taken up and reviewed with the question of thegeneral military policy of the Allies to be consideredduring the ensuing week;[1365-187]B 2
The Supply of WarMaterial andEcruipment toG-reece.7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a telegram fromM. Venizelos, dated the 12th July, and a telegram from Mr. Cracken-thorpe, No. 4913, of the same date, on the subject of the assistanceto be given to Greece.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff intimated that thematter really depended upon the larger question as to whether theBritish or French took over the reorganisation and equipment ofthe Greek Army. He regarded the operations in the Balkans asprimarily a French enterprise, and in a -recent telegram from theMilitary Attache at Athens it was stated that the reorganisation ofthe Greek army was to be confided to the French. Further, theAllied High Commissioner and the Commander-in-chief in that theatrewere both French, and General Robertson saw many difficulties inour undertaking the task in question. He said that we were not ina position to spare any heavy guns for Greece.On the other hand, it was pointed out that there was some doubt as to the wisdom of handing over the control of the greek army and Policy to the French.The War Cabinet decided that The question of the assistance to be given to the Greeks shouldbe raised, together with other Balkan questions, at the approaching Conference in Paris.prisoners captured by theEnemy.8. In reference to the decision of the War Cabinet that theField-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the British ExpeditionaryForce should in future report the number of prisoners taken by theenemy (War Cabinet 154, Minute 13, and War Cabinet 162,Minute 8), the Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that hehad heard from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig that preparationshad been made to do this, but that it must be understood that anysuch estimate must inevitably be largely based on guesswork.Interview withPressRepresentatives.Palestine.9. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he proposed to hold an interview on the 17th July with some of theeditors of the leading newspapers in order, by explaining to them the exact position of affairs as fully as possible, to induce them touse their efforts to steady the public instead of alarming it, and expressed a desire that the First Sea Lord and the Chief of theImperial General Staff should be present at the interview withprepared statements of the situation at sea and on land, which hecould communicate to the representatives of the Press.10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention to telegram No. E.A. 40, dated the 12th July, from General Allenby,which he had just received, and which he intended to bring beforethe War Cabinet so soon as the members had had an opportunity ofstudying it.Italy.Mesopotamia.11. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention to telegram No. 247, dated the 12th July, from General Delme-Radcliffe, giving the views of General Cadorna as to the intentions of the Italians.12. In reference to the reports as to Turkish reinforcements,under General Falkenhayn, having been sent toyrards Baghdad, theChief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he had receiveda reassuring message from General Maude as to his ability to dealwith a hostile attack.
Submarines.13. The First Sea Lord reported that a seaplane had droppedbombs on a German submarine in the Channel, and that the decoy-vessel &quot; Cullist &quot; had sunk another submarine.T.B.D. &quot; Tarpon.&quot;Movements ofGerman MercantileVessels.Steamship&quot; Westmeath.&quot;Tonnage forConveyance of horses.14. The First Sea Lord reported that the T.B.D. &quot; Tarpon &quot; hadstruck a mine off Dunkirk, but had been got into that port, where she was being temporarily repaired.15. The First Sea Lord reported certain movements of Germanmercantile vessels, in conjunction with Belgian Relief ships.16. The First Sea Lord reported that the &quot; Westmeath &quot; hadbeen torpedoed in the Channel, but had only been damaged in onecompartment, and had reached Cherbourg under her own steam.17. The War Cabinet had under consideration the questionof tonnage for the conveyance of horses (Papers G.T.-1129 and1393).Lord Derby pointed out that, according to a telegram of the11th July from the Viceroy, there would be considerable danger ofa shortage of horses in Mesopotamia next year unless horses were taken from Australia to India in order to be hardened during thewinter. The difficulty in doing this lay in the fact that Australiahad no shipping in which to send these horses and we were very short of shipping.The War Cabinet decided that It was unnecessary to settle this matter for the period of two orthree months.ShippingAllotted toOverseasExpeditionsOutside Erance.18. The Secretary explained that the object of the proposals put forward by General Smuts in his Report (Paper G.T.-1180,War Cabinet 172, Appendix I) had been to save shipping.It was pointed out that, when this subject had previously beenconsidered by the War Cabinet, the Secretary of State for theColonies had been opposed to it on account of the bad political effect such a course might have on recruiting in Australia, sincethe Australian Government was under the impression that theAustralian troops should pay a visit to England.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff admitted the desir-ability of the course proposed, if it were practicable, but detailedvarious difficulties which he considered were insuperable.The War Cabinet decided that The policy of using troops for service in the theatres of warnearest their homes (as detailed in Recommendation (b) ofthe Report by Lieutenant-Genefal Smuts, Paper G.T.-1180, War Cabinet 172, Appendix I) could not be carriedout, owing to the practical military difficulties in theway.S War Aims.Conference for theBevision of treaties.19. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained therewas some confusion as to the scope of the two International Con-ferences which it had been proposed should be held, and that hewas being continually pressed by the representatives of certain ofthe smaller Allied Powers to state what subjects were going to bediscussed at these Conferences, in order that they might be repre-sented if vitally concerned. In this connection the War cabinet had before them communications from the Belgian Government,
the Serbian Society, and certain members of Parliament (paper g.T.-1201, G.T.-1355, G.T.-1353).It was pointed out that two Conferences had been proposed.The first was to be held during the present month in Paris. Theoriginal intention had been to discuss future policy at Salonic%,after a preliminary Conference on the shipping question connectedwith that subject, but it was probable that the War Policy of theAllies would be discussed from a wider point of view. The secondConference had been proposed by the Russian Government for thepurpose of considering a revision of the various treaties dealingwith War Aims. Originally it had been proposed to hold this conference in August, but the date had now been postponed until september. The idea had got about that the question of war aims, in which the smaller Powers were vitally concerned, wouldalso be raised at the first Conference.The War Cabinet were agreed that (a.) In the present state of the War it was desirable to postpone the discussion of War Aims as long as possible, as, once it was known that we were discussing these questions,the effective prosecution of the war might be renderedmore difficult. For this reason it was important to discourage the idea that this subject would be discussed at the next Conference, and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should adopt this attitude in replying toany queries he might receive from the representatives ofthe various Powers.(6.) A decision as to the subjects for discussion by, and thedate of, the proposed Conference on the Revision of treaties, should be deferred until the return ofMr. Arthur Henderson from Russia.The Constructionof Mine-layersand merchant ships in theUnited States ofAmerica.20. In reference to War Cabinet 181, Minute 10, regarding the conversion of two interned German vessels into minelayers, and inview of the fact that the British Naval Attache at Washington had telegraphed that a definite statement from the British Governmentthat it would be preferred that the two vessels should be converted into minelayers instead of cargo-carriers would carry great weight,in which both the First Sea Lord and the Shipping Controllerconcurred, the War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph tothe British Ambassador at Washington in the followingsense : With reference to the proposal from BritishAdmiralty now under consideration by Navy Board,that two German vessels interned in the United states should be converted into minelayers, it is consideredthat these two vessels will be of more valuable service as minelayers than as cargo-carriers.Ireland.21. The War Cabinet agreed that Lord Curzon, in reply to afurther letter he had received from Lord Midleton regarding thelatteFs apprehensions as to the situation in Ireland, should inform him confidentially of the gist of the decision taken at the WarCabinet Meeting on the 14th July (War Cabinet 186, Minute 1).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 16, 1917.
