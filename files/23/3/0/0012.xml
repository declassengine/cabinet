One man was killed hy the explosion.Gallipoli. 5. The First Sea Lord reported that a telegram had beenreceived from the Vice-Admiral Commanding in the eastern mediterranean, stating that there had been heavy firing on the mainland opposite Teziedos, and on the Gallipoli Peninsula.

The First Sea Lord reported that the Americans had beenSubmarine making trials with certain anti-submarine devices, which it wasDevices. hoped   would   give   the   position   of  a   submarine up to fourmiles&apos; distance, but a telegram just received stated that the trialswere not proving satisfactory.Mammoth Ships. 7. With reference to War Cabinet 163, Minute 12, the First sea lord reported that the building of the Mammoth Ship at&apos; Messrs.Harland and Wolffs was going on but slowly. The great difficultyin the case of building other ships was material. A number of standard ships were being converted into oilers for the Admiralty.Admiral Jellicoe undertook to report further on the matterafter consultation with Sir Eric Geddes.8. The First Sea Lord was asked to enqtdre whether it wasthe case that lately several ships had been torpedoed without beingsunk, and, if this were so, what was the explanation ?The United Statesof America :Man-Power and&apos;Equipment.9. The War Cabinet had before them a forecast (dated the14th June, 1917,), by General T. Bridges, of the arrival of theAmerican land forces in France.   (Appendix.)General Bridges stated that the desirability of training largenumbers of American recruits in this country and in France hadbeen fully discussed by the Mission, but there were undoubtedlyelements in the States hostile to the proposal, preferring that thetroops should first be formed into a National Army. The questionof the types of guns to be supplied to the American Army was stillunsettled, but it was hoped that General Pershing would recom-mend his Government to adopt the British types.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs emphasised thedifficulty of making the Government at Washington realise thescale of preparation required for the conduct of the war. He had made some representations to the American Ambassador on thesubject. He urged that the Cabinet should strongly supportGeneral Pershing in his recommendations with regard to thesupply of men, and should make representations at Washingtonthrough the French Government with reference to the manufactureof guns. -&apos;
Prisoners of War.The Report of theMesopotamiaCommission.The War Cabinet, having reviewed the position at some length,decided that (a.) The Minister of Munitions should, as a preliminary step,prepare reports on the capacity of the United States to manufacture guns, aeroplanes, and other main munitions of war.(o.) Copies of these reports should be furnished to lord northcliffe.(c.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should ask theAmerican Ambassador to invite the United StatesGovernment to send a military officer of high rank. tothis country, and should suggest that the BritishGovernment should send a similar officer to Washington.(d.) The Secretary of State for War should consider what officercould most suitably represent this country.10. With reference to War Cabinet 150, Minute 20, theSecretary of State for War brought to the notice of the War Cabinetthe view expressed by the President of the French Council, that ameeting between Lord Newton and General Friedrich would be veryinopportune, and that it would have a very unfortunate effect on french public opinion and be misrepresented. As a result atelegram had been sent to our Minister at the Hague directing himto inform the Dutch Government that the meeting must be postponed, although in the meantime the German Government had accepted the suggestion.Lord Derby expressed the view that nothing but good could have come of such a conference from the point of view of our prisoners, and that it was very desirable that it should take place.- Divergent views were expressed as to whether public opinion inFrance would be affected or not by such action on our part, and itwas thought that such a meeting, solely in the interests of our prisoners, could in no way be fairly construed as an approach on our part towards peace. Moreover, the&apos; French were known to have obtained advantages for their prisoners through the mediation of swiss authorities. It was further felt that, if it were known that,after the Germans had accepted our proposal in this matter, we hadallowed the thought of French public opinion to make us cancel thearrangements, to the detriment of our prisoners in Germany, therewould rightly be very strong feeling, on the part of the british public, against any such action, which it would be extremely difficult for us to justify.- The War Cabinet requested Lord Robert Cecil to see M. Cambon at an early date, and explain to him the views of the War Cabinet in this matter,and point out that in view of the strong feeling on thequestion in this country it would be almost impossible forus to refuse to meet the German representative proposed.&quot;The War Cabinet desired Lord Robert Cecil to report to them as soon as practicable the result of his interview withM. Cambon.11. With reference to War Cabinet 161, and War Cabinet .162,.Minute 18, the War Cabinet further discussed what disciplinary action should be taken on the Report in question.[1365-164]B 2
The War Cabinet decided to ask Lord Curzon, Mr. Barnes, Lord Derby, and Mr. Austen Chamber-lain to confer and submit to the War Cabinet the names ofthe officials against whom, in their opinion, disciplinary action should be taken.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 15, 1917.
APPENDIX.Forecast of the Arrival of the American Land Forces in France.(1/105/305.)1. Numbers. There are at present available about 180,000 regulars and 300,000national guard. The former are good troops, and about half of the latter are seasonedmen who have spent up to a year on the Mexican border.The first 500,000 of the compulsory draft system will be available early inSeptember.2. Officers.-In addition to the officers of the regular army and militia, 40,000 ofthe best of the young men are now in the officers&apos; training camps, and will be availableto draw upon when the first levy comes up for training.3. Policy. The present policy is to send over division after division as transport is available. Up to the end of this year these divisions will be of regulars and national guard, and may be considered, after they have had a short training in France,as good troops.   Beyond this no decision has been made.4. Time. The first division 20-25,000 men should be in France by end July(America says end June). The second by end of August, and after this a division per month may be calculated upon, making six divisions, or 120-150,000 men, hy the endof 1917.During next year favourable circumstances may allow of further speeding up, butit is safer to calculate on the same rate of progress, and to count on twelve divisionscoming over in 1918.5. Totals. The above will bring the total up to 500,000 men i.e., 18 divisions, 360,000 men ;Services, 140,000 men.6. Reinforcements. There will be no lack of reinforcements by the end of thisyear, as 980,000 men will then be available, of whom none have less than four months&apos;service.7. Training. General Pershing intends to do a large part of the training inFrance, and is insistent that every available transport should be filled with men and sent over.8. Artillery. The most serious need of this army is artillery, and unless a soundpolicy is adopted early, it seems unlikely that it can be sufficiently supplied with field guns. There will be available 400-500 3-in. guns, and if the 18-pr. is adopted,America can keep pace with the demand. The experts of the American Mission favourthis procedure.9. Rifles. There is no difficulty about the supply of rifles.10. Clothing and Equipment. Some 500,000 sets are available, and it is probablethat the factories can keep pace with growth of army. The most likely source of difficulty is clothing.11. Theatres of Operation. I did not discuss the question of theatres of operationof the American Army and heard of no suggestions as to its employment except onthe Western front. There was at one . time, however,. an idea in political - circles of sending a division to Russia, via Vladivostock, but this was opposed by the GeneralStaff on the grounds that such dividing of the small forces immediately available wasunsound and that the carrying capacity of the Trans-Siberian railway was inadequate forthe task.12. Conclusions.- To sum up, leaving all matters of sea-transport out of thequestion, it seems probable that America can have an army of 120-150,000 men inFrance by the 1st January, 1918, and of 500,000 men by. the end of 1918. That thesefigures for 1918 may, under favourable circumstances, be improved upon.That the question of the supply of guns requires particular attention, a sounddecision and a thorough development of production.(Signed)      TOM BRIDGES,M a) or-General.June 14, 1917.
