Proposed TransportConference inLondon.12. With reference to Paper I.C.-24, namely, the Report of theAllied Naval and Military Conference held in Paris on the 24th July,the War Cabinet were informed that the proposal to hold a TransportConference in London was made by the British, with a view of finding out how many United States troops could be transported and maintained on the Western Front. The present proposals of theUnited States Military Authorities, as regards the shipping requiredto maintain their force, were looked upon as extremely high. TheWar Cabinet felt that we should guard, as far as possible, against any attempt on the part of the Conference to create a shippingpool, it being highly undesirable and dangerous that the control ofshipping should be taken out of our hands and placed in the handsof the Allies as a whole.The War Cabinet decided that-The First Lord of the Admiralty should be asked to act as chairman of the Conference, and requested him to issue the Terms of Reference, and to telegraph such to theUnited States Government.They further decided that The Shipping Controller, in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, should prepare a statement of the british requirements up to August 1918.Coal for Italy. 13. With reference to War Cabinet 197, Minute 8, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs stated that he understood the admiralty and the Shipping Controller took the view that, unless the italians were prepared to improve their methods regarding commerceprotection, the Shipping Controller would not be justified inallocating further shipping for the conveyance of coal to Italy.The First Sea Lord stated that that was hardly the view takenhy the Admiralty, and, moreover, the Italians claimed to protect theshipping from Gibraltar to Italy, and it was doubtful if we could show that their efforts in this direction had not generally been successful. He added that the Italians had refused to entertain theproposal that the entire control and protection of trade in theMediterranean should be placed in the hands of the british commander-in-Chief.Nationalisation of 14. With reference to War Cabinet 46, Minute 12, the war shipping. Cabinet had before them G.T. Papers 1407, 1428, and 15 i 7, the first of which contained a proposal by the Shipping Controller that heshould be authorised to give Lord Inchcapo and his colleagues inthe established lines an assurance that it was not intended that shipping should be nationalised after the War. Whilst unwilling togive any guarantee that shipping would not be nationalised, theWar Cabinet authorised The Shipping Controller to inform Lord Inchcape that, what-ever might be the policy of this country after the War, thestep of obtaining the use of the whole of the personnel andmaterial of the shipping organisations, both at home andabroad, was taken as a measure of war policy, and was not intended as any part of a policy of nationalisation ofshipping.___Basra. 15. The Shipping Controller asked the authority of the WarCabinet to withdraw a number of ships from the MesopotamianForce. He supported this proposal on the ground that thedischarge of ships-at Basra had fallen from 300 or 400 tons a day,which was the rate some three weeks ago, to 100 tons a day at
present. He was satisfied that a good deal of tonnage wasunnecessarily locked up at Basra as the result. He expressed theopinion that, if an emergency should arise, the ships could hereplaced.The War Cabinet asked General Smuts to examine and decide on this point, afterconsultation with the War Office and the ShippingController, and to report his decision to the War Cabinet.Honours for 16. With reference to War Cabinet  173, Minute 5, the WarMercantile Marine.
