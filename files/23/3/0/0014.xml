Army Recruiting.1. THE War Cabinet discussed the prospects of the forthcoming debate on the administration of recruiting. Instances were adducedof several alleged cases of abuse of their powers by the MilitaryAuthorities. Most of these had already been Investigated * andproved to be groundless ; others were still under consideration.The question of stoppage of pensions was also brought forward,and emphasis laid on the necessity of adhering to statements that had been made in the House of Commons to the effect that therewould be no reductions or alterations in the conditions of pensionsalready awarded.It was pointed out that there was very strong feeling againstcalling up again men&apos; who had been invalided out of the Service in preference to extending the age limit to, say, 45.The War Committee decided To make a concession with regard to men who had servedabroad during the period of , the war, and had been discharged on medical grounds : such men, on application,being in future granted their discharge.Release of menfrom GovernmentDepartments.2.
