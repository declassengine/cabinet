The United Statesof America:The financial situation.2. With reference to War Cabinet 197, Minute 7, it waspointed out to the War Cabinet that it was undesirable to approach the President dhect with regard to finance, as the proper channelwould be to send our proposals to Mr. McAdoo, whose dutiescorresponded to those of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in thiscountry.The War Cabinet decided To send the telegram set out in the Appendix to Mr. McAdoo,through the Ambassador in Washington, a copy being sentto Lord Northcliffe direct through the Consul-General at new York.that-The War Cabinet further approved a proposal to the effectLord Northcliffe should be instructed, pending a definite reply from the United States Government to the telegramreferred to above, to keep up the exchange, to the limit ofhis capacity to do so, from his New York resources, it being pointed out to him, however, that we cannot placeany more gold at his disposal for shipment from Ottawa.Control of CoaMines.3. With reference to War Cabinet, 157, Minute 18&apos;, the WarOaDinct bad before them a draft Bill and Memorandum by the CralController on the Coal Mines Control Agreement (Paper G.T.-1 527).The Coal Controller explained that the scheme provides, interThe Submarine 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 195, Minute 11, the war situation. Cabinet had under consideration a draft telegram, prepared at their request by Mr. Philip Kerr, for communication to the President ofthe United States of America &apos;Paper G.T.-1539).The War Cabinet decided that The draft should be amended by Mr. Philip Kerr and Mr.    tJoseph Davies in the undermentioned respects, and re-submitted for their consideration : (a.) The omission, in the interests of secrecy, of thoseportions of the draft telegram dealing withmethods of attack.(o.) A complete statement of the number of engagements with enemy submarines, with a classificationaccording to Admiralty anticipations as toresults, e.g., probable, possible, &amp;c.(c.) A revision of the estimates of output of british merchant shipping, which were undulyoptimistic.(cZ.) Speaking generally, the report should be made lesspessimistic, as in its present form it did not represent the real prospects.The War Cabinet considered the question as to whether the telegram, as finally approved, should be sent (a.) Through the British Ambassador at Washington;(6.) Through the United States Ambassador in London, in h.official bag ;(c.) Through Lord Northcliffe;and decided that The telegram should be sent to Lord Northclifie, to be handedby him personally to the President.
alia, for the compensation of those owners whose profits may fall below the pre-war standard by reason of war conditions not common to the whole industry, or by reason of the action of the Controller.It is proposed that the compensation fund, known as the &quot;CoalMines Excess Payments,&quot; should be collected by the Board of InlandRevenue and paid to the Coal Controller ; bat, to enable the InlandRevenue authorities to do this, an Act of Parliament was thought to be necessary. To compensate the coalowners through the existing machinery of the Civil Liabilities Commission would prove verydisadvantageous financially to the State On the other hand, it wasvery doubtful whether the scheme could be carried through by regulation under the Defence of the Realm Acts.The War Cabinet considered the present Parliamentary position,and agreed that it would be very inconvenient to introduce a Bill atthis stage of the Session, in view of the urgency of the Corn Pro-duction Bill, which must take precedence over all other legislation,and in view of probable opposition from coalowners. The very factthat the control of coal mines was being effected by Bill, and not under the Defence of the Realm Acts, might raise difficult questions as to the administration of these Acts.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the arrangements for control as proposed in thedraft Bill and explained in the memorandum accom-accompanying  it.(6.) To ask the opinion of the Law Officers as to whether theproposed agreement could not be enforced under theDefence of the Realm Acrs, this being, in the opinion ofthe War Cabinet, the preferable method of procedure, ifallowable.(e.) In the event of procedure by regulation not being possible,to proceed by Bill early after the Recess.(d.) To authorise the Coal Controller to proceed with hisarrangements, on the assumption that the Governmentwould fully support him on the lines indicated above.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 81, 1917.
APPENDIX.Copy of Telegram approved by War Cabinet for despatch to British ambassador at Washington.Foreign Office to Sir G. Spring-Rice.PLEASE communicate following message from Chancellor of the Exchequer toMcAdoo :-&quot; The memorandum which was handed to Mr. Page on the 20th July last at the instance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in clause 3 that, &apos; unless theUnited States Government can meet in full our expenses in America, includingexchange, the whole financial fabric of the Alliance will collapse. This conclusion willbe a matter, not of months, but of days.&apos;&quot; That memorandum was intended to set forth, for the information of the UnitedStates Government, the extent of the financial effort which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave already made and the approaching exhaustion of their resources. It did not dealwith the question of exchange in particular. As, however, this form of assistance isat the same time most vital to His Majesty&apos;s Government and most difficult to renderclear to the Government of the United States it is dealt with here: -&quot;1. The growth of the existing system for supporting the exchange.&quot; 2. The cost of it.&quot; 3. The consequences of withdrawing it.&quot; 4. It is pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government must now learn how far theUnited States Government will be able to give them the necessary support. A pointhas now been reached when a definite decision must be taken within the next few days,and His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the Government of the United States will agree with them as to the necessity of putting an end to the present state of uncertainty.&quot; 1. At the commencement of the war the balance of trade with America was infavour of this country. That is to say, there were, on balance, purchasers of sterling in New York. We were able, therefore, to finance our war purchases from America -as also from the rest of the world- -by the sale of sterling exchange. In the summer of 1915 large amounts of dollars were required to finance advance payments on shelland rifle contracts placed for the Russian Government, with the result that the british treasury were no longer able to provide themselves with all the dollars they required bythe sale of sterling in New York, as hitherto. A break in the exchange took place, andit became necessary in the course of the autumn of 1915 for the British Treasury to finance their munition purchases by other means than by the sale of sterling in new York. By the beginning of 1916 they had to go a step further, and to cometo the support of the commercial exchange by making a standing offer through theiragents in New York to purchase sterling from all-comers at a fixed minimum rateof 47676.&quot; The Anglo-French loan of 1915, the mobilisation of dollar securities for sale andcollateral security of loans, and the export of gold to the United States were the chiefsources of the funds required for these two purposes.&quot; This arrangement provided a direct means for the conversion of sterling intodollars, by which British purchasers of American goods could reckon on financing them at a fixed rate, while the Allies and Dominions who received sterling credits could turnthem into dollars to meet their American payments. Indirectly, also, it stabilised insome degree all the other foreign exchanges, since sterling could, if necessary, be.converted into any other foreign currency by first purchasing dollars, and then usingthese dollars to obtain the foreign currency required.&quot; As time went on this system developed into one by which the nervous centre ofthe Allied financial system was as much in New York as in London. While gold wasoccasionally exported to other destinations, the bulk of it was reserved, for America.By furnishing America with unprecedented quantities of specie we ourselves provided the basis of the credit she required to finance her sales to us.
&quot;At first the adverse balance was relatively small. In fact, up to April 1916, wewere still able to supplement our other resources by the sale on balance of a certainamount of sterling.   From May 1916 the balance has been progressively adverse.&quot;In November and December 1916 we were faced with the first serious exchangecrisis since the summer of 1915. As shown in a table below, the average weeklyrequirements for the support of the exchange amounted in December 1916 to44,600,000 dollars. ,&quot; Since that date high prices, increased expenditure, the growing exhaustion of theAllies, the depletion of British financial reserves in all parts of the world, and the progressive destruction of our export trade by diversion of man power into otherchannels, have combined to raise the figures, taking one month with another, far beyond those of 1916.&quot; The past seven months have accordingly required a lavish employment of ourultimate liquid reserves. The conclusion of the third year of war finds us with thesereserves at a level which will be entirely exhausted in a few weeks if the present drain on them is to continue.&quot; 2. The appended table shows the average weekly expenditure of the british treasury in the United States for each month since April 1916, the first columnrepresenting the purchase of commodities and the transfer of dollars to Allies, and thesecond the support afforded to the dollar exchanges. While the figures in the second column have fluctuated widely it will be seen that the average weekly requirementsduring the past three months have worked out at rather more than 40,000,000 dollars.Average Weekly Expenditure in the United States of America.Month.1916-AprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember1917-JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJuly (3 weeks to 21st)TreasuryAccount.ExchangeCommittee.Total.000 Dollars26,96933,03335,37720,22536,26737,30046,95833,5S834,31331.11241,82661,85&apos;.)42,15239,5583S,07249,919000 Dollars5.156*9,82412,0085,592li,34S14,07319,71331,72S44,60012,12535.05111,95216,71740.40261,27521.606000 Dollars.21,31842,85747,98525,81750,61551,37366,67065,31673,91343.23776.S7773.80858,86979,96099,34771,525Sale of sterling.&quot; The fluctuations are mainly due to. the movement of American banking funds toand from London. It is obvious that when American bankers are increasing theirLondon balances the exchange benefits, and, conversely, that when they are with-drawing balances the normal burden on the exchange is aggravated. In the course ofthe present year cash balances and bills held on American account in London have been as high 53,500,0001. (L4th April) and as low as 22,500,0001. (23rd June).&quot; Allowing for the fact that the figures of the past three months have beenabnormally inflated by the withdrawal of American balances, and that they include thecost of Allied wheat purchases, which will be paid for in future otherwise, the average cost of supporting exchange, assuming that American balances in London remainstationary, is not likely to be less than 25,000,000 dollars a week, or 100,000,000 dollarsa month. &apos;&quot; 3. The above summary of past events will have shown what a central place thesupport of the dollar exchange has come to take in the financial system of the Alliance.The funds which we have placed at the disposal of the Allies and the Dominions have[1365-199] C
been mainly sterling, the purchasing power of which, in all parts of the world, has been maintained by this means.&quot; To estimate the consequences of withdrawing support from the sterling exchangein New York we must consider the purposes now served by supporting it. The followinganalysis refers in each case to the balance unprovided for after allowing for Americansordinary trade obligations to ourselves and the Allies : &quot; (a..) Exports on private account from America to this country for commoditiesnot yet under Government control of which cotton is chief.&quot; (ft.) Similar purchases by the Allies, who have not yet controlled so manycommodities as we have.&quot; (c.) Purchases from America by the British Dominions and by India, only asmall part of whose trade is under Government control.&quot; (d.) The cost of neutral exchange arbitraged over New York, that is to say,those Allied purchases in neutral markets which are being financed atpresent out of the resources of the United States.&quot; Of these the United States Government will probably wish to enquire most closely into the magnitude and character of (d). The amount involved is fairlysubstantial, but we have no reliable information on which to estimate it.&quot; If the policy of supporting the exchange wrere to be abandoned to-morrow, the collapse not only of the Allied exchanges on New York, but also of their exchanges onall neutral countries, is to be expected. The Allies and all parts of the Empire, exceptCanada, would be affected equally. It is likely that exchange quotations would notonly fall heavily, but would become nominal, that is to say, there would for themoment be no exchange at any price, and business would be at a standstill.&quot; The consequences of such a state of affairs are partly material and partlypsychological.&quot; (i.) On the material side, exporters from the United States to the UnitedKingdom, other Allied countries, Australasia, India, and South Africa would he unableto sell their sterling bills on London. New business would be interrupted at the source,and vessels would be delayed in port by reason of shippers being unable to obtaindelivery of goods without paying for them.&quot; From the American point of view this would invove a breakdown for the time being of the mechanism of a great part of her export trade, the paralysis of business and the congestion other ports. From &quot;the point of view of this country and of the other Alliesit would represent the cessation for the time being of supplies such as cotton, which,while still left in private hands, are nevertheless essential to the conduct of the war.It must be remembered that practically no trade takes place except in commodities ofnational importance, considerations of freight, quite apart from finance, having alreadycut off the greater part of what is dispensable.&quot; At the same time American bankers would see their London assets locked up forthe period of the war at least, and also heavily depreciated.&quot; How long this state of affairs would last would depend upon the success of ourremedial measures. The initial disorganisation must be distinguished from thepermanent results. It is possible that even the initial disturbance would be somewhat less serious than indicated above. But whatever the degree of initial disturbance, the eventual result, if the estimate of 100,000,000 dollars a month is correct, would be thatthe foreign purchases of the Alliance would have to be diminished by at least this amount monthly.&quot; This sum, however, would not represent the whole effect. The destruction ofBritish credit abroad would cut us off from certain sources of income which we nowpossess. So long as existing foreign balances in London remain immobilised, we couldnot expect foreign countries to increase them. At present we pay in sterling fornumerous foreign purchases. Difficulties of freight and supply prevent the neutral countries from, spending this sterling forthwith. In the meantime they leave it inLondon, and payment is thus deferred.&quot; Allowung, therefore, for losses arising out of the injury to our credit, the economies we should have to effect would largely exceed the 100,000,000 dollarsmonthly.&quot; Pending reorganisation of trade and finance, the loss would, as pointed out above,extend beyond this to commodities which, after things had settled down, we might hope to pay for.&quot; On the material side, therefore, the breakdown of the exchanges must grave1&quot;.&quot;
impair our capacity to carry on the war ; but, by itself, it need not prove disastrous.We could, if necessary, effect economies on the scale indicated above and still carry on.&quot; (ii.) Turning to the psychological consequences, the results would be plainly-disastrous. The open abandonment of the support of the exchanges is a step whichwould be interpreted in all circles as indicative of deep-seated distress. Not only wouldour credit have been impaired in all neutral centres, but vague doubts would have beenawakened which might spread far beyond their origin.&quot; Chief of all there is the effect on the mind of the enemy. There are doubtlessofficials in Berlin whose duty it is to watch and report upon our financial position andembarrassments. They must suspect our growing financial difficulties, and can make agood guess at our position just as we can with their food difficulties. But there is awoidd of difference between a shrewd guess and a piece of tangible evidence.&quot; The encouragement and corroboration of their hopes which they would discoverin our abandonment of the exchanges would, therefore, be enormous. Germany wouldhave at last received a second hope added to that of the submarine on which to baseher policy of endurance. It would be said, whether it is true or not, that with the collapse of their exchanges the Alliance cannot endure six months more.&quot; We have openly attached hitherto the utmost importance to the position of ourexchanges. We have constantly proclaimed to the world that it is the corner-stone ofour policy. To point out the depreciation of the German exchanges and the stability ofour own has been a favourite form of propaganda in all parts of the world. We have urged the neutral world month after month that this is to be taken as the criterion offinancial strength. It would be imprudent to believe that all this can be swept on one side without a far-reaching reaction.&quot; 4. The Memorandum handed to Mr. Page on the 20th July will have shown tothe Government of the United States to what a low level our liquid reserves have nowfallen. In the event of the exchanges being allowed to fall and of our having to under-take the reorganisation of our affairs thus made necessary, we must do so with a certainamount of liquid resources still in band. We cannot therefore deplete them further,and must look to the United States Government for the future.&quot; We must therefore know, if possible, immediately, whether the Government of theUnited States can give us the financial assistance we need.&quot; In asking this we do not overlook that we are asking them to moderate twoconditions which they have hitherto regarded as essential.&quot; In the first place, to provide funds for the exchange is to defray uncontrolledexpenditure for undefined purposes. We can only say that we have already extendedthe sphere of Government control far beyond what would have been believed possible ashort time back. But the complexity of the world&apos;s trade is too great to allow thewhole of it to become amenable to a centralised control. This limited continuance ofprivate commerce is represented financially by the commercial exchange.&quot; In the second place, the support of the exchanges involves in part the employ-ment of American funds to finance the purchases of the Allies outside America.America must be the judge of how great a burden she can support. At the present stage of the conflict her resources are greater than ours. She has not only her ownpre-war resources, but more them 200,000,000/. additional in actual gold with which theAllies have furnished her in the past three years. It is necessary for the Allies to makepurchases in neutral countries in excess of what they are themselves able to finance.Within comparatively narrow limits they look to the United States to augment these resources out of her exports of goods and of gold to neutral countries so far as hercapacity allows.   She cannot render a more valuable service.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government trust most earnestly that they may learn within a fewdays&apos; time the general attitude of the Government of the United States to this mostvital question. This is necessary, because it is only by the assistance of the UnitedStates Government that the support of the exchange can be continued, and at any moment, the demand for exchange in New York may be so great that our represen-tatives there may be compelled to cease to support it if they cannot rely upon funds from United States Government for the purpose. If any further information is desiredit will be at once supplied, and Lord Northcliffe, who is familiar with the whole situation,would gladly discuss it with you.&quot;Message repeated to Mr. Bayley for Lord Northcliffe.
