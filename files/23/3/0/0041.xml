The Question ofmaking the munitions of WarActs binding uponthe Grown.1. THE War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum datedthe 16th July, 1917, by the Minister of Munitions, on the subject of&quot; The Question of making the Munitions of War Acts binding uponthe Crown &quot; (Paper G.T.-1449). *It appeared that the question was somewhat complicated, andwould need consideration by the several Departments concerned.The War Cabinet therefore decided that a Committee, composedof the following members Mr. Barnes (in the Chair),Representatives of The Admiralty,The War Office,The Treasury,The Ministry of Munitions, andThe Ministry of Reconstruction, andA Law Officer of the Crown,should examine the proposals made in the memorandum and report to the War Cabinet.Salonica. 2. The Director of  Military Intelligence reported that theBritish troops had carried out a successful raid at a point on the struma River, resulting in the capture of 1 Bulgarian officer and33 other ranks, and 60 killed.Palestine. 3. The  Director  of  Military  Intelligence  reported   that  a successful raid had been carried out in the neighbourhood of Gaza,in which over 100 Turks had been killed, and 17 prisoners, 1machine-gun, and 1 trench mortar, with other booty, had been captured by our troops.The Eastern Pront. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the retreatof the Russians continued, and that Colonel Neilson had reported the position of the 11th Russian Army to be hopeless, and that theonly measure of the ability of the Germans to get in rear of the 8thand 7th Russian Armies would be their own strength. Accordingto the Austrian official account, the Russian Army had retiredto behind the River Sereth, at Tarnopol, and was followingback south-east of Brze^ny. The Germans had crossed theSereth and captured a large amount of war material at Jezierna.General Macdonogh considered that if the German advance were continued sufficientlv loug it would eventually lead the Germans toKieff, the possibility of their reaching that town depended on the resistance offered by the Russian troops. The strength ofthe enemy round Kalisch had been increased, since the russian offensive started, by 5 German Divisions and 1 Austrian Division.East Africa. 5. The Director of Military Intelligence informed the WarCabinet that General Van Deventer had reported an advance, with three columns, upon an enemy force south-west of Kilwa, and thatwe had occupied the position held by the enemy, who had retiredSouth. Our casualties had amounted to 1-2 British officers,180 British rank and file, and 400 Indian and African rank and file,killed and wounded. The enemy losses had also been heavy.General Van Deventer, in his telegrams, had accentuated his need of field guns.
Air-Raid onHarwich andFelixstowe.Naval Losses.Submarines.Royal Naval AirService bombing raids.General Macdonogh explained that three out of the five batteriesof Field Artillery which had been in East Africa wrere being sent to egypt, but in view of General Van Deventers telegram the questionof replacing them was being considered.The urgent necessity of clearing up the position in East Africaonce and for all, and the fact that the conduct of operations by us inthat quarter was monopolising the carrying power of thirty-five ships,were pointed out.It was agreed that, in order that the campaign in this quartermight be brought to a close at the earliest possible moment, everyreinforcement that it was found possible to send to General VanDeventer should be sent to enable him to do this.The War Cabinet decided that The question of reinforcing the British Forces in British EastAfrica, so far as possible, in order to bring that campaignquickly to an end, should be considered by the WarOffice, and a report on the subject submitted to the WarCabinet.6. The Director of Military Intelligence read a report givingthe details of the air raid on Harwich and Felixstowe on the morning of the 22ud July. So far as his information went, 7 soldiers and 1male civilian had been killed, and 20 soldiers and 3 male civilianshad been wounded. One German aeroplane had been brought downover the sea.The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff stated that no extensive damage to material had been done during the German raid onHarwich, and that the total number of Royal Naval Air Servicemachines which took the air on this occasion was 25.The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff undertook to submit areport, containing all available details of the air raid onthe 22nd July, against Harwich and Felixstpwe, to the leader of the House of Commons.Majpr-General Shaw gave details of the dispositions of thevarious detachments of the Royal Flying Corps near the South-east coast, and explained that there had been no aerial fighting overEngland on the morning of the 22nd, because the raiders hadmerely touched the coast and then, on having their formation brokenby the anti-aircraft armament, had skirted the coast-line and retiredwithout penetrating inland. He stated that an approximate estimateof the value of the damage done was 3.000Z.7. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff gave the figures for theNaval losses during the previous three days. He stated that theminesweeper &quot; Queen of the North&quot; had been sunk; that the mines-weeper Newmarket&quot; had not been heard of since the16th July and had probably been torpedoed ; and that boats hadbeen picked up from the armed merchant-cruiser &quot; Otway,&quot; whichhad been torpedoed but had tried to beach herself, with whatresult was not yet known.8. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff informed the WarCabinet that the &quot; G 3 &quot; had probably sunk an enemy submarine.9. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff gave details of twobombing raids which had been carried out from Dunkirk by theRoyal Naval Air Service station there.[1365-193&quot;!B 2
Statement of Naval 10. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff undertook to prepare,:Losses- for the information of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a. tabularstatement and analysis of the British shipping losses incurred sincethe 1st february, 1917. *Italian Claims in 11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumAsia Minor. by Lord Robert Cecil, dated the 21st July, 1917, on the subject ofthe Italian claims in Asia Minor (Paper G.T.-1474, Appendix), and decided that The alteration proposed by Lord Robert Cecil, as amended by.Baron Sonnino (with the concurrence of Lord robert cecil), should be adopted.12. The War Cabinet had under consideration the question ofthe necessity of giving further information to the United StatesGovernment, upon the effects and exact position of the enemy&apos;ssubmarine campaign, as asked for by Lord Northcliffe (telegramNo. 1962, dated the 21st July, 1917). It was made clear duringthe discussion that both the American Government and public were,probably with some reason, confused as to the actual situation,owing to the contradictory tone of the reports which were current;and it was agreed that some definite statement on the subject wasnecessary, and that it was highly desirable that any such statement should be made direct to the President.Proposed Inter- 13. The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to theAlly Council. nature of  the financial relations   existing   between   the  AlliedGovernments and that of the united States, which seemed to himto be a more serious matter even than the question of theeffect of the submarine warfare. He explained that the UnitedStates Government had stated that they were prepared to advance85,000,000 dollars to the British Government by the 15th August,- but were not prepared to give any more financial assistance until an inter-Ally Conference had been held in London to discuss and decide upon the relative financial, supply, and transport needs ofeach of the Allies (telegram No l&apos;0S3, dated the 19th July, from theBritish Ambassador at Washington). Mr. Bonar Law said that itwas impossible to carry the matter through in the way suggested,since the United States Government would not be represented, and each Power would press its own claims and be unwilling to abatethem. He had sent a statement to the American Ambassador inLondon to make it clear that, unless the American Governmentcould provide the money to cover purchases in the United States,the whole financial arrangements of the Allies would collapse.Mr. Bonar Law referred also to the vital necessity of retaining theexisting fixed rate of exchange between the Allies and the UnitedStates, which the latter Government had failed to appreciate, and added that, if this principle were to be abandoned, the moral effect would be as disastrous to the cause of the Allies as that of a greatGerman victory, although the actual economic results wouldprobably be not more than transient.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to Lord Northcliffe, in answer to the latteFs telegramNo. 1962, to advise him that a detailed reply as to thesubmarine situation wrould be sent him for immediatecommunication to the President of the United States ;that much the more important issue in the whole situation, however, was the question of finance, and thatThe United Statesof America:Information to begiven to thePresident in regardto Submarine War-fare.
a considered Memorandum on the subject of finance,supplies, and transport would also be sent.(6.) The Admiralty should prepare, for the approval ofthe War Cabinet, the material for the detailed reply toLord Northcliffe regarding the submarine campaign.(c.) Lord Curzon and Lord Milner should, in consultation withthe Treasury, the Ministry of Munitions, and theMinistry of Shipping, consider for approval and despatchthe draft reply already prepared by the Treasury to telegram No. 2083 from Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, dealingwith the proposed Inter-Ally Council in London.(Initialled)A.

APPENDIXG.T.-1474. - tItalian Claims in Asia Minor.Memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil.THE Cabinet will recollect tbat after the Conference at St. Jean de Maurienne,they made definite propositions to Italy modifying to some extent what was thereprovisionally agreed. Since that time considerable discussion has taken place between us and the Italians, and an agreement has been reached on all outstanding pointsexcept one. It was provided at St. Jean de Maurienne that &quot; if at the time when peace is declared the total or partial possession of the territories contemplated in the agree-ments come to between Great Britain, France, Italy, and Russia, as to the disposal of apart of the Ottoman Empire, cannot be fully accorded to one or more of these Powers,then the interests of the Powers concerned will be again taken into equitableconsideration, having regard to the efforts made by each of the Powers in the war.&quot;Baron Sonnino strongly objected to the concluding phrase &quot; having regard to theefforts made by each of the Powers in the war.&quot; After several interviews with theItalian Ambassador, I proposed to him either to leave out the whole of the clausequoted above, or to substitute for the words of the clause beginning &quot; then the interestsof the Powers......&quot; down to the end (&quot;in the war&quot;) the following words:&quot; then in any alterations or adjustments of the provinces of the Turkish Empireconsequential on the war, due regard shall be had to the preservation of the equilibrium in the Mediterranean in accordance with Article 9 of the London Agree-ment of May 1915.&quot; To this latter suggestion Baron Sonnino has agreed, except thathe wishes to say, instead of &quot; due regard shall be had,&quot; &quot; equitable considerationshall be given.&quot;On the whole, I see no objection to his proposed amendment, which, indeed,appears to me slightly less favourable to the Italian Government, as being lessmandatory in tone, than the words I originally proposed.In accordance with an undertaking I have given to the Ambassador. I now submitthis matter to the War Cabinet for their acceptance or rejection. The new phraseproposed by me seems to me to leave the matter exactly where it was under theoriginal agreement of May 1915, except that it only applies to alterations oradjustments to Turkey made in consequence of the war, and therefore would have no application to Cyprus. It is also to be noted that, as compared with the suggestion made at St. Jean de Maurienne, it only deals with the Mediterranean equilibrium, andwould, therefore, exclude all consideration of Mesopotamia or Arabia. In other words,unless the French obtain part of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Italians would not beentitled to claim anything under this clause.(Initialled) R. C.July 21, 1917.o
