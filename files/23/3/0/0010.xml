2The United Statesof America:British MilitaryRepresentation.1. THE War Cabinet had a short discussion on the subject ofa successor to General T. Bridges as Head of the British Mission inthe United States of America.It was decided that The War Cabinet, should see General Bridges on the followingclay.Italy Mid Asia 2. With reference to War Cabinet,. 156 Minute 3, Lord Robert&apos; Cecil stated that the Italian Chamber was due to meet in a fewdays, which rendered a decision necessary. Baron Sonnino had asked that a Memorandum might be prepared summing up thepresent stage of the negotiations ; this had been done, and theMemorandum had been handed on the previous dav to the italian ambassador (Paper G.T.-1001).It was evident that Baron Sonnino considered that the question was held up for the moment owing to the condition stipulated bythe British Government that the conclusion of the arrangementdepended on an increased effort by Italy. On this subject the WarCabinet had before them the view of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff that in the recent offensive Italy had done all that could be expected of her for the present; that, in view of the inherent and proved objections to mixed forces, the possibilities ofpolitical friction, and the fact that the French were sending only,000 men, the Italian proposal to send 6,000 men to Palestine wasobjectionable.The War Cabinet, while agreeing that British troops inPalestine were preferable to any other, felt that it was itndesirableat the present time to exclude the possibility of Italian co-operation in Egypt, pending the full investigation of our War Policy by theCabinet Committee on War Policy (War Cabinet 159, Minute 13).Having regard, however, to the provision inserted in thelast sub-paragraph of Lord Uobert Cecil&apos;s Memorandum (paper g.T.-1001), that if the total or partial possession of the territoriescontemplated in the Agreement cannot be accorded to the powers concerned &quot; then the interests of the Powers concerned will beagain taken into equitable consideration, having regard to theefforts made by each of the Powers in the War,&quot; the War cabinet decided That Lord Robert Cecil should be authorised to inform theItalian Government that the condition of increased effort will be waived, but that, if and when the moment arrives,the British Government will expect the Italian Governmentto render assistance in some form in any operationsundertaken in the East.Greece. .      3. The War Cabinet decided that Lord Robert Cecil should ascertain from Lord Granville andfrom M. Sfavridi, the representative of M. Venizelos inLondon, the views of M. Venizelos on the present positionin Greece, and should telegraph to M. Jonnart, as well asto the French Government, to ask their views on thesubject of future policy.King Constantine. 4. It was decided that Lord Robert Cecil should consult M. Jonnart and the FrenchGovernment as to the expediency of allowing King Constantine to take up his residence in such a centre ofintrigue as Switzerland.
Russia.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported bad newsrespecting the moral of the 9th Army, which was in Roumania.The troops in this Army refused not only to take the offensive, but.even to mend roads and take other measures of defence.Zeppelin L.43 7. The First Sea Lord reported that a British seaplane had destroyed. brought down a Zeppelin, &quot;L. 43.&quot;He undertook to give the Chancellor of the Exchequer andLord Curzon a statement carefully drawn up so as not to-indicate the precise means of destruction employed.Submarines.8. The First Sea Lord stated that the Senior Naval Officer at malta had reported various actions with submarines, including oneclaimed to be successful by a Japanese destroyer and two claimed by the French.He made the usual statement of shipping losses.:.M.S. &quot;Avenger.&quot; 9  The First Sea Lord reported that the cruiser &quot; Avenger,&quot;the best ship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, had been torpedoed70 miles off the Shetland Islands. She was struck aft and was unable to steam, but she was still afloat, and had been reached by two destroyers.German Aeroplane 10. The First Sea Lord reported that a German aeroplane had brought down. been brought down at Nieuport; she was not, however, one of theraiders that came to London on the 13th June.The Use of BulgesH.M.S. &quot; Grafton.&quot;11. With reference to War Cabinet 162, Minute 10, respecting the &quot; Grafton,&quot; wdiich, after being torpedoed, had safely arrived at malta, the First Sea Lord reported that the &quot; bulges &quot; had proved acomplete success.The War Cabinet asked-The First Sea Lord to let the War Cabinet know how long the&quot; Grafton&apos;s bulges would take to repair.The War Cabinet suggested that full reports of this incidentshould be communicated by the First Sea Lord to Sir Eric Geddes,with a view to the possible extension of the use of bulges, even to merchant shipping.Mammoth Ships.12. The First Sea Lord was asked To ascertain from Vice-Admiral Geddes the latest developmentof mammoth ships.[1365-163]Austrian Army. 5. The Chief of the Imperia] Qeiieral Staff reported that duringlast month certainly four and a half, and possibly nine, AustrianDivisions had been moved to Italy from the Eastern front.
13. With reference to War Cabinet 162, Minute 7, no furtherinformation had been received in regard to yesterday&apos;s air raidbeyond what had already appeared in the newspapers. It was believed that one hostile aeroplane had been brought down in thesea, but it had not actually been seen to disappear, and therefore its -destruction could not be regarded as a certainty. It was understoodthat a total of fifty-two British machines were in the air againstthe raiders in this country, apart from the machines at Dunkirk.Out of all the casualties caused by the raid there was not the nameof a single soldier.With regard to future air raids, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff explained that we must not expect our airmen always to be able to prevent the raiders from reaching London, because thetime occupied by the enemy aeroplanes in flying from the coast toLondon is less than the time taken by British machines in ascendingto the great heights necessary to engage them.Aerial Policy. 14. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff urged that our air Policy was not extensive enough. In his opinion the number ofour aeroplanes should be increased on a large scale, even at theexpense of other weapons, e.g., Tanks, if necessary.The War Cabinet agreed with the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff in principle and decided that The Air Board, in consultation with the Ministry of Munitions,the War Office, and any other Departments concerned,should be invited to draw up a scheme for the developmentof aircraft, stating at whose expense the development must take place.Manufacture of motor Cars, &amp;c, inthe United States.15. It was stated that General Bridges had reported that, owingto standardisation, there are relatively fewer skilled mechanics inAmerica than there are in this country. It was therefore suggestedthat the Ministry of Munitions and the War Office should considerthe question of transferring to the United States the manufacture oftractors, motor-cars, and other standardised machinery, while theBritish firms should specialise in the building of aeroplane engines.The War Cabinet decided that A telegram should be sent by the Ministry of Munitions to lord northcliffe in New York in the above sense.Reprisals for Air 16. The War Cabinet decided ^a^s&apos; To discuss with Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, inter alia, the. - subject of reprisals for air raids, with a view to the investigation more- particularly of the effect which the, adoption of a policy of reprisals would have on the aerialoperations on the Western Front.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should invite sir douglas Haig to bring General Trenchard with him on his forthcoming visit.
18. The War Cabinet had a short preliminary discussion onthis question. It was suggested, as a basis for discussion, that theNavy and the Army should set an example by releasing for active service all their officers and men of military age who are engagedupon work of an easy nature which could be just as efficiently doneby men who are over military age.19. The Chief Secretary for Ireland, referring to his MemoProposed Amnesty, randum to the Prime Minister (Paper G.T.-1027), stated that everyhour confirmed, his view that there ought to be an amnesty to prisoners, to take effect at a selected moment. If any were released,he considered that all ought to be set free. Though most reluctant to set at liberty persons who had been guilty of murder, he pointedout that many of the convicted had been led into treasonable action without realising, until the last moment, what was involved.Mr. Duke gave some striking instances of this, and stated that therewas but little, if any, evidence in the depositions to identify theimprisoned rebels with any of the most serious cases of treacherousfiring on troops. The majority of the prisoners would, in hisopinion, in an extradition case be regarded as political prisoners andnot as criminals. There was not a man among them of whom itcould be said that he had shot a man in cold blood.Sir Edward Carson said he would agree to the amnesty if therewere any reasonable prospect of an improvement in the situation inIreland being brought about therebj&apos;. But previous instances ofthe release of prisoners did not encourage the belief that this wouldbe the case. He was inclined to think that there was a good deal ofGerman propaganda behind the recent agitation.The Prime Minister read a letter from Sir Horace Plunkett tothe effect that he feared that many parts of Ireland would refuse tosend delegates to the Convention if there were no amnesty.It was pointed out that the refusal of amnesty provided a flagaround which the extremists were able to rally moderate opinion,which was sympathetic to the idea of an amnesty. The recent meeting in Dublin, at which a policeman was killed, was mentionedas an example of a meeting which would have had no chance ofbeing held but for the fact that it was got together on the plea of supporting an amnesty. To grant an amnesty, it was urged, wouldbe to remove this rallying point.General Smuts gave the War Cabinet an account of thecircumstances under which amnesty was granted in South Africa.The &quot;War Cabinet held the view that the real question for decision was whether the amnesty would or would not give theConvention a better chance, and that this was the only ground onwhich it should be considered. They agreed with Mr. Balfour that,if granted at all, no attempt should be. made to justify it. except on the ground that it was hoped it. would create a better atmospherefor the Convention.While attaching great weight to Sir Edward Carson&apos;s opinion,that the proposed amnesty would not have the anticipated effect,but, on the contrary, would merely strengthen the rebel movement,and to the objections, based on Irish administration in the past,urged by Mr. Long, the War Cabinet, in the hope that it wouldengender a favourable atmosphere for the Convention, and in theDefence against air Raids.Position andProspect of recruiting.Ireland:17. The War Cabinet considered the possibility of a temporaryconcentration in the near future in this country of the best type of aircraft and the best pilots, in order to give an exceptionally hotreception to the raiders on the occasion of their visits.
belief that without it a successful issue to the Conference was hardlyto be expected, decided To recommend to the King that an amnesty should be granted.^In reaching this decision, the War Cabinet were stronglyinfluenced by the views of the Chief Secretary, and particularly byhis statement that there was no direct evidence that any of the prisoners had been guilty of deliberate and treacherous murder.It was agreed that An announcement should be made in Parliament at noon onFriday, the loth June. a2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 14, 1917.* Mr. Long desired that his dissent from the decision might be recorded..
