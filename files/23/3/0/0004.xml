2Shipbuilding 1. THE attention of the &quot;War Cabinet was drawn to a letterPurchase. from tjie Admiralty (No. C. 6/1V/S. 4317, dated the 5th June, 1917),pointing out that a Department of State had recently taken steps topurchase a vessel for its use without reference to the Controller ofthe Navy, and that another Department under the direction of theController was simultaneously conducting negotiations for thepurchase of the vessel in question.The War Cabinet ilecided that The decision contained in War,Cabinet 136, Minute 11, shouldbe extended so as to make Vice-Admiral Sir Eric Geddesresponsible for meeting the requirements of all other government Departments requiring shipping, as well asthose of the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Ministryof Shipping. They accordingly authorised the admiralty to issue a circular letter to all Departments concerned, tothe effect that, by a decision of the War Cabinet, theController of the Navy is charged with the duty of meetingthe combined requirements of&apos;all Government departments for vessels of all classes, and requesting them in future to notify their needs to him, instead of endeavouring to satisfythem independently.The fixing of 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by LordPrices oi this Derby (Paper G.T.-941) urging that prices should be fixed for thisSeasons Fruit. u -v -   - /     g   s i     . . .         ---seasons fruit, on the ground that the requirements of the War Officeof fruit for the provision of jam for the troops rendered it essential thatsuch, fruit should be obtainable at reasonable prices. The price of fruit was rising day by day, and, owing to the warm weather, thefruit crop was likely to be earlier than usual. In the opinion of theWar Office, a loss of 25O,00OZ. had already been incurred owing to non-fixing of prices, as they had been obliged to purchase at aninflated rate.The Food Controller stated that he had, on the previous day,made arrangements for a Conference, to be attended by himself by representatives of the&apos; fruit growers, and by representatives of thejam makers, with a view to fixing a reasonable price for this season&apos;sfruit. The Conference was to meet that afternoon, and he was con-confident that a satisfactory and amicable arrangement could be arrivedat by consultation with the parties concerned, which would meet thecase.The War Cabinet left the question for decision by LordDevonport, in concert with the Secretary of State for War,after Lord Devon port&apos;s interview with the fruit growers andjam makers the same day.The Western Front. y   r^he Director of Military Intelligence reported the opening ofa big offensive, at 3 a.:m. that morning on a 9-mile front, againstthe Wytschaete-Messines Ridge ; all the immediate objectives hadbeen reached and a large number of prisoners had been taken. he also reported that in the attack on the previous day on Greenlandi . HiiJ, the operations, which were on a front of 1,500 yards, had so far been completely successful. General Macdonogh explained thesituation in both areas on the map.The Italian Front. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence reported heavy fighting on the Uarso from. Faitihrib to the sea, in which the Austriansclaimed, in the course of this fighting, the capture of 256 officers andover. 10,000 men.    The Officer temporarily in charge of the British
Mission at Italian General Headquarters, however, had telegraphedthat the Italians had re-taken all the positions North of [vomarjefrom whim they had been driven, but that South of that place theyhad been compelled to fall back, the maximum depth of their retire-ment being nearly a mile at a point North of S. Giovanni.Russia. 5. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that the reasonof General Alexeieffs retirement appeared to be entirely political.General Alexeieff was known to be a strong disciplinarian with no political predilections, and the Provisional Government had someapprehensions that the measures he might take to restore disciplinemight cause them embarrassment. His place as Commander-in-Chief was to be tak-iii by General Brusiloff. The Officers&apos; conference had dissolved without achieving much. According to the latest information, the hopes which had been lately entertained ofestablishing better conditions in the Army were not likely to berealised in the immediate future, and the avcent impression of an improved moral was weakening. The Mission from the Black SeaFleet to the Roumanian Front had not been a success. .8. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that anotherGerman division had recently been moved from the Eastern to theWestern Front, making a total of eleven divisions moved since the1st April from east to west, and nine divisions from the &quot;Western tothe Eastern Front.7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a proposal byM. Albert Thomas that two-British batteries of 6-inch guns shouldbe supplied ro the Roumanian Army (Petrograd telegram No. 825,dated the 3rd June, 1,917).In consideration of this personal rec Mnmeudation of M. Thomas,and of recent encouraging reports of the improved state of theRoumanian Army, the War Cabinet were disposed to favour thisproposal, and desired that the War Office&apos; should examine it in afavourable spirit. Their final decision was postponed until thereceipt of replies to the enquiries made of General Poole and &quot;GeneralKnox (War Cabinet .155, Minute 4).The Secretary of State for war undertook to draft a reply forthe Prime Minister to send personally to M. Thomas.The Mediterranean 8. The   Deputy  Chief  of the Naval Staff reported certainZone. activities of the Royal Naval Air Service in the Mediterranean area,as the result of which incendiary bombs had been dropped on the crops in Macedonia, and a munitions dump in Gallipoli had beenexploded.Mercantile 9. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff made his usual reportShipping Losses. of shipping losses during the previous twenty-four hours. The lossesduring the past two or three days had been above the average, but,on the whole, the monthly losses were well within the forecast whichhad been given in the early part of the year by Admiral Jellicoe tothe War Cabinet.Transfer ofGerman DivisionsEoumania:Heavy Artillery.Mr. ramsay macdonald.10. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to certain new factors which had arisen within the last few hours, and which boreon the permission given to Mr. Ramsay Macdonald to proceed to
Russia and Stockholm, in accordance with die decision of the Cabinet(Wax Cabinet 144, Minute 2).In view of the fact that Mr. Henderson had not yet replied tothe specific questions put to him as the result of War Cabinet 154,.Minute 21, the War Cabinet authorised The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform mr. Ramsay Macdonald that unforeseen new factors had recently arisen, and that consequently he must not rely on being permitted to proceed.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was authorisedto  ask for a postponement until the following day of&quot;Mr. Stantons question in the House of Commons.11. The Minister of Munitions stated that a question was downto be asked in the House of Commons by Mr. Y*7- C. Anderson, M.P.,relating to an individual named &quot; Gordon,&quot; who was alleged to havebeen employed in a special Section of the Ministry which had beenestablished to investigate cases of sabotage and employment of aliensand other suspected persons under the Ministry. Dr. Addison statedthat shortly after he had been appointed to his present post he. had come to the conclusion that this Section was not competent to perform the duties allotted to it ; he had accordingly given orders that itshould be abolished, and he had requested Scotland Yard to under -take all such investigation in the future. All investigation intoLabour-unrest had&quot; been in the charge of Scotland Yard since december last, at the request of the Ministry. He said he had beenasked by the Leader of the House to answer the question, but he considered that this duty came more appropriately within thepixrvmce of the-Attorney-General or the Home Secretary.The War Cabinet concurred in this view, and instructed theMinister of Munitions&quot; to request the Attorney-General to reply to the question on behalf of the Government.12. The War Cabinet had before them the Report on JointStanding Industrial Councils, by a Sub-Committee of the Recon-struction Committee, together with a Memorandum by Mr. Montaguas to the procedure to be adopted in dealing with the Report.The War Cabinet considered whether it was desirable to issueReports of this type dealing with one aspect of the Governmentsindustrial policy before they were able to consider that policy as awhole. Tin re were difficult and unsolved questions connected withthe future position of unskilled and semi-skilled persons who, duringthe war, had been employed on work closed to them before the war,and whom the Government could not ignore. On the other hand, it-was urged that the prevailing industrial unrest provided a favourable opportunity for the ventilation of proposals like those agreed to bj^the whitley Committee. Further, to set up the necessary machinery required to give effect to the proposals would take some time, and itwas important that the Ministry of Labour should have such machinery&apos; in order before peace was concluded.The War Cabinet decided that In the first instance, the Ministry of Labour should circulate theReport to the leading Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Asso-ciations, and also to the Commissioners on industrial unrest, with a view to ascertaining their general attitude to the proposed Industrial Councils at an early date.Question in theHouse of Commonsregarding the man&quot; Gordon.&quot;reconstruction committee:Report on industrial Councils.
parliamentary procedure.13. Mr. Montagu called the attention of the War Cabinet to the strain that will be imposed upon the Parliamentary machine in giving effect to any adequate programme of reconstruction and in winding upthe emergency legislation arising from the war. It was not a matter which could be suitably dealt with by the Reconstruction Committee,but was one for the Houses of Parliament.The War Cabinet decided that Parliament should be asked to appoint a Select Joint Committeeof both Houses to consider the machinery of parliamentary procedure in the period following the termination of thewar, and it was arranged that the Leaders of both houses should take the necessary action after consultation withMr. Montagu.Disposal of WarStores.14. Mr. Montagu put before the War Cabinet a suggestionemanating from the War Office that there should be set up a singleauthority to dispose of all Government stores at the end of the war.The War Cabinet approved the suggestion, and decided that The Stores Department of the Ministry of Munitions should form the nucleus of such an authority, to which should beadded representatives of the War Office and the Admiralty ;recommendations as to the composition of and reference tothis authority to be made by Conferences between repre-sentatives of the Departments concerned and the Recon-struction Committee.Liquor Control: 15. With reference to War Cabinet 153, Minute 2, the WarTerms of Reference    Cabinet further considered the terms   of  reference to the threeCommittees on the liquor trade, and adopted the following :  The Government, having decided that it is necessary, as an urgent war measure, to assume control of the manufacture and supply of intoxicating liquors during the war and theperiod of demobilisation, and being of opinion that such control will involve the purchase after the war of theinterests concerned in such manufacture and supply, have appointed the following Committees to enquire into andreport at an early date upon the terms upon which those interests shall be acquired.The Committees will also have to report on the financial arrange-ments for the period of control.Sir George Youngerasked whether the Government proposedto take control. before the Committees had reported.&apos; It was agreedthat this should not be done, but that control should be taken afterthe Bill incorporating the financial terms recommended had passedits Second Reading.16. With reference to War Cabinet 153, Minute. 2, the WarCabinet approved the following&apos; list of members for the Committees,,whose terms of reference are set forth in Minute 15 : [1365-157])Committee, for England and Wales.Lord SumnerorThe Right Hon. Sir Charles Swinfen-Eadv, LL.D. (Chairman).The Right Hon. Sir Thomas P. Whittaker, M.P.Sir J. b. Harmood-Banner, M.P.Sir William Plender.Sir Arthur W. Chapman.;Sir Thomas Hughes.C

C.A., or another Accountant.A Representative of the Treasury.Committee for Ireland.(Mr. Duke undertook to submit names later.)17. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on the &quot; Tonfor Ton &quot; Policy (Paper G.T.-736) and the instructions which shouldbe given to the British representatives at the Conference of Allies,which the French Government have proposed should be summoned to consider a declaration on the subject.The President of the Board of Trade stated that in their memorandum of the 27th October, 1916, dealing with the EconomicDesiderata in the Terms of Peace, his Department had suggestedthat, if the Allies were in a position to do so, they should insist on a surrender of enemy shipping at least equivalent in tonnage value andgeneral character to the whole of the Allied ships sunk or destroyedas the result of belligerent action ; they feared, however, that anysuch scheme might be frustrated unless precautions were taken inadvance against the colourable transfer of enemy vessels to neutralflags. They accordingly suggested to the Foreign Office thedesirability of the Allies safeguarding the position by making a joint declaration to the effect-(a.) That they accept the principle that enemy merchant ships are liable for claims in respect of merchant ships destroyedby enemy action ;(6.) That they recognise no transfer of an enemy ship to a neutral flag which takes place before the final conclusionof peace and which is effected without their consent.The Allied Governments were asked if they would agree to adeclaration on these lines, and the French Government, while accepting the principle of the declaration, considered that it wouldbe desirable for certain matters to be discussed at an Inter-allied conference before any such declaration was made. The ForeignOffice had accordingly suggested to the Board of Trade that an interdepartmental Conference should be assembled to consider thesequestions.. In the course of the discussion, the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs stated that Mr. Hurst, of his Department, was now in Paris discussing with the French Government various points in connection with this subject.At the suggestion of Lord Robert Cecil, the War cabinet decided that Further consideration of their policy in this regard should be deferred until the return of Mr. Hurst from France, and
they instructed the Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to raise the question again when he considered thatit was ripe for their further consideration.Control of Coal-mines :Compensation to bepaid to Mine-owners.IS. With reference to War Cabinet *114, Minute 2, the WarCabinet approved the scheme of compensation to coal-owners forthe control of their mines, contained in the Memorandum of thePresident of the Board of Trade, dated the 1st June, 1917 (paper g.T.-905) (Appendix).The War Cabinet rejected the suggestion to proceed by Bill,and authorised the President of the Board of Trade to obtain the assent of the Mining Association and to make the agreement binding on all owners by a Defence of the Realm Regulation, the agreement being announced to the House of Commons after the agreementwith the Mining Association had been concluded.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W-June 7, 1917f
APPENDIX.G.T.-905. -Compensation to Goal-Otcners for the Control of their Mines. tWITH reference to the Minute 2 of the War Cabinet of the 5th April, theController of Coalmines reports that he has now concluded his negotiations with aSpecial Committee of the Mining Association on the draft heads of agreement regarding compensation for control.The following are the chief points in the draft Agreement: 1. Coal-owners to retain 5 per cent, of their profits in excess of their pre-war profits(as compared with the 20 per cent, retained by other industries). Nopercentage standard to be allowed, as under the Finance Acts.2. Compensation to be the amount of pre-war profits reduced by three-quarters ofthe reduction of the output, where output is not reduced by more than30 per cent.3. Below the 30 per cent, level the scale of compensation to cease to operate, andthe amount of compensation per ton to be reduced where the fall of output is not due to action by the Controller.4. Cost of maintaining in repair mines closed by order of the Controller and ofreopening them after control to be met by an additional tonnage levy on theindustry, the Controller contributing 40 per cent, of the sum required, butonly so far. as any surplus accruing to him after payment of the compensa-tion and administration expenses will allow.The question of the Agreement has been considered at a meeting of the ControllersAdvisory Board.The Owners&apos; side of the Board stated that they looked upon the Agreement asbeing very drastic and severe on the owners as&apos; compared with any other controlled. industry, and they believe the Agreement to be a favourable one to the Government.The Miners&apos; side of the Board expressed the view that it was the governments own affair what Agreement was made with the Coal-Owners. They did not wish to beregarded as taking any responsibilitj- fur the Agreement. Their contention is that no agreement can withhold from them the right to present a demand for increased wages to meet the increased cost of living, whether the ascertained values of coal justify sucha course or the reverse.If the above terms are approved by the War Cabinet, it remains to be determinedwhat steps should be taken to give effect to the arrangement, and the following alternative methods are submitted for the consideration of the War Cabinet: 1. Proceed hy Bill, to which the Agreement would be scheduled.2. Obtain the formal assent of the Mining Association, and make the Agreementbinding on allowners bv a Defence of the Realm Regulation.In the latter event, the question arises at what stage the Agreement should becommunicated to the House of Commons. Should the draft be circulated as a white paper, so that it can be discussed before it is finally settled, or should the Agreementbe first concluded with the Mining Association and thereafter announced to theHouse ?A.
