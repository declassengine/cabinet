There was, in normal years, an increase of perhaps50 per cent, in the quantity brewed in the summer months, corn-pared with the rest of the year. The proposal before the cabinet was to allow an increase of per cent, on the restricted barrelagenow permitted to be brewed, for the ensuing three months. The[1365-1.67]
effect of this would he that the stocks of malt, which would otherwise last till February (according to the most recent census),would be exhausted in November. It was pointed out that, wdiilethis policy would meet with opposition from the Temperance Party,the Parliamentary position was, at the moment, unfavourable to theintroduction of a Bill embodying a policy of control and purchase,and the members of the War Cabinet were also preoccupied withurgent questions of war policy of the highest importance. The new proposal was a temporary expedient put forward without prejudice to the larger policy of the Government. It would diminish unrest,and give time for the Finance Committees appointed by the Govern-ment to get to work, It in no way need interfere with the decisionof the Cabinet to proceed with the purchase of spirits for industrial purposes (War Cabinet 165, Minute 14).The War Cabinet decided : (a.) To permit the brewing of 33  per cent, of beer over and above the present allowance, from now to the end ofSeptember.(b.) To permit this addition on two conditions -(1.) That the strength of beer is reduced to a specificfigure, e.g., 1037 or 10*40.(2.) That  the price of beer is correspondingly reduced.(c.) To authorise the Home Secretary, in consultation with theDepartments concerned, to give effect to the above decisions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S W.,L-;:. t: June 22, 1917.
