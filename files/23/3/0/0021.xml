No more whole-time workers should be taken from theland except with the consent of the County agricultural committees,&quot;should be extended to cover Wales.Labour Delegation 2. In regard to the reports on the visit of the Labour delegation to Russia. to Russia, April-May 1917 (Paper G.-150), it was decided that An opportunity should shortly be given for the delegates to beinterviewed briefly by the War Cabinet, and that Mr. Barnesshould communicate with the delegates to this effect.Prisoners of War. 3. In reference to War Cabinet 169, Minute 2, the Secretaryread telegram No. 1886, dated the 29th June, 1917, from Sir W.Townley, forwarding a message from Lord Newton to the WarCabinet, outlining a proposal for the exchange of a total of 6,000combatant and non-combatant prisoners, in the proportion of4,000 combatants and 2,000 civilians.The Secretary also read the reply (telegram No. 1763, dated the1st July), which was approved by the War Cabinet.Attention was drawn to the desirability of Lord Newtoncommunicating with his own Department, and not with the WarCabinet direct.CompanyDirectorships:Tenure by HisMajesty&apos;s Judges.4. The War Cabinet had under discussion a Memorandum bythe Secretary for Scotland on the subject of Judges and Director-ships, dated the 26th June, in reference to a directorship held byLord Salvesen (Paper G.T.-lly2).The War Cabinet decided that (a.) In their opinion it Avas undesirable for any Judge tohold any directorship in commercial undertakings ofany kind whatever.(b.) That future appointments to the Bench should be madeunder an honourable understanding to this effect.In the case under discussion, the Secretary for Scotlandundertook to have the matter brought forward by a question inthe House of Commons.The Secretary undertook to communicate this decision of theWar Cabinet to the Lord Chancellor, the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer, and the Home Secretary, in orderto obtain their concurrence before it became operative.Honours for 5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by the mercantile Marine.   President of the Board of Trade, dated the 28th June, on thesubject of Honours for the Mercantile Marine (Paper G.T.-1205).The sup-o;estion as to the bestowal of a few honours on leadino-representatives of captains and engineers was approved,subject to the agreement of the Secretary of State for theColonies.
3 WC 173 &quot;Coal for Italy. 6.  The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum,dated the 22nd June, 1917, upon the subject of Coal for Italy,prepared by Lord Robert Cecil, in accordance with War Cabinet 141,Minute 3 (Paper C1.T.-1137).The Minister of Munitions said that the import of ore had beenreduced to 585,000 tons, in order to allow traffic to be diverted tothe Atlantic. It would be unsafe to reduce that figure, theminimum for summer requirements, any further. He consideredthat the further reduction of 35,000 tons of ore per month from theMediterranean, as outlined in alternative (6) of the memorandum,would be disastrous, and he would prefer to follow alternative (a) ifforced to make a choice. He added that the Americans were apparently doing very little to help us in this matter, and suggestedthat the American Government should be urged to give help by shipping coal direct to Italy.It was pointed out that out of 400,000 tons of coal which was due to arrive in Italy in the month of June, according to theprogramme, only 243,000 tons had actually reached that country tothe 23rd of that month, the deficiency being caused by the loss ofAllied and neutral ships and the longer time taken on the voyagethan had been anticipated when the programme was framed.The Shipping Controller explained that the&quot;British Governmentwas under guarantee to send 120,000 tons per month to Italy, andthat during June this amount had been exceeded by 50,000 tons.He anticipated that the same excess over guarantee could be furnished during July. He also confirmed that the AmericanGovernment had shown no disposition to accede to invitations given them to help in this matter.The War Cabinet decided that &apos;The amount of coal to be shipped to Italy direct by the BritishGovernment during the month of Julv should be 170,000tons, i.e., 50,000 tons more than the guaranteed amount,and that this total should be exceeded if possible.The War Cabinet further decided that The Secretar)&apos;&apos; of State for Foreign Affairs should communicate with the Italian Government, suggesting that that Govern-ment should approach the United States Government witha view to obtaining coal direct from America carried in american bottoms.The President of the Board of Trade undertook to furnish anestimate of the amount of coal that the Italian Governmentwould be able to import for itself during the month of July.Shortage of Oats 7.  In reference to War Cabinet 170, Minute 3, the shipping and Forage in Italy.   Controller informed the War Cabinet that two oat-ships had been allotted to Italy instead of one.Supply of Heavy 8. In reference to War Cabinet 155, Minute 4, the War CabinetArtillery to Russia,   had before them the following documents :  Tele gram No. M. 14 of the 10th June, 1917, from GeneralPoole to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and covering note of the 16th June by the secretar^ of Statefor AVar (Paper G.T.-1076) ;Letter of the 5th June from General Poole to the Chief of theImperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-1189) ;Telegram No. 1152 of the 9th June from Colonel Blair to the^Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-1044) ;giving details as to what extent the guns already sent to Russiawere being used by the Russians.
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained that the factors which governed the allotment of the armament which wasbeing produced were (1.)   That   everything   possible   should   be   given   to   the expeditionary Force in France ;(2.) That the Italian Government  had  asked for 25  morebatteries of 6-in. howitzers, of which the French were trying to furnish one-half, and of which we should consider the supply of the other half;(3.) That the Commander-in-Chief in Egypt would be almost certain to ask for more of these guns.It was pointed out also that the present moment, when theRussians were apparently reassuming the offensive, would be a badtime definitely to refuse to furnish any more armament.The War Cabinet decided that The policy to adopt was still one of temporisation, and that,pending the results of the Russian offensive, the WarOffice should inform the Russian Government that very heavy demands for armament were being made on theBritish Government, which would do whatever was possibleto meet the Russian demands later.9. In reference to War Cabinet 157, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had under consideration the following letters fromthe Roumanian Minister in London to the Prime Minister No. 464/171 M.R., of 27th February, 1917 : No. 571/17 M.R., of9th March, 1917; No. 875/17 M.R. (Paper G.T,-1080a), andNo. 1777/17/36 (Paper G.T.-1080).Having regard to the heavy demand and urgent need for guns in other theatres, as mentioned in the previous Minute ; to thedoubtful efficiency of the Prussian armies on which Roumaniadepended ; to the fact th:it any munitions now sent out would notarrive in time for an offensive ; and to the fact that 20 aeroplaneswere being despatched to that country, it appeared that it wouldnot be worth while to send either more guns or more aeroplanes toR.roumania this year. tThe War Cabinet decided that (a.) The policy to adopt was still one of temporisation, and thatthe War Office should communicate with General Poole,in Petrograd, with a view to inducing the RussianGovernment to send to Roumania some of the Britishguns wdiich had arrived in Russia and were not being used ; the Russian Government being informed, ifnecessary, that the British Government would replace those guns later, if possible.(6.) That no more aeroplanes, beyond the twenty Sopwithmachines being despatched to R.roumania, should besent to that country.(c.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to reply to theRoumanian Minister in London to this effect.10. The War Cabinet had under review one or two points inregard to the assistance the British Government was prepared togive to Norway in case that country joined the Allies. In explana-tion of the fact that the aeroplanes being despatched to Norwaywere not equipped with machine-guns or accessories, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that the Norwegian Governmentreally required aeroplanes for the express purpose of attacking
The Eastern Front. 11. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that no official intelligence had yet been received of the Russian offensive,but that the Austrian reports stated that it had failed.Mesopotamia. 12. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theRussian forces had recently shown a certain amount of activity onthe Persian frontier opposite Mosul, which had been useful incausing the diversion of some Turkish forces which might otherwise have pressed on towards Baghdad.The Hedjaz 13- The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that in theHedjaz the Arabs had contributed some assistance by attacking andcapturing a convoy on its way to Medina.The Italian Front. 14. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that duringthe previous forty-eight hours the Italians had lost all the groundthat they had gained on the Trentino Front, their losses including3 companies of engineers, 4 mountain batteries, and 3,000 men.The Western Front. 15- The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therehad been heavy fighting on the French Front, particularly^ on theChemin des Dames and near Verdun. The progress made by theBritish at Lens was satisfactory, but, according to the information received, the Germans had done a great deal of damage to the coalmines, which probably would not be in working order within ayear.Salonica. 16. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the figuresfor the percentages of sick on the Salonica Front, showing a greatreduction on the previous year.[995-4]CZeppelins. It was highly undesirable that the secret of our methodof carrying out such attach should be disclosed by sending over tothe Norwegians, before war was declared, the means by which thiswas effected. The accepted policy was that, once war was declared,the British Government would send to Norway aeroplanes, trainedpilots, and all the necessary equipment for attacking Zeppelins,which operation would be carried out by the British aviators.In reference to War Cabinet 168, Minute 13, the Secretary ofState for Eoreign Affairs, in reply to the First Sea Lord, informed the War Cabinet that he had spoken to the American Ambassador,in regard to the coroperation of the United States in rendering naval assistance.The First Sea Lord explained that he had. counted on theassistance of American submarines for the defence of Norway, butthat the United States Government seemed disinclined to send anysubmarines over. The strength of the Naval force he would like tohave from the United States was that which would replace theBritish force earmarked to proceed to Norwegian waters in certain eventualities, i.e. :One Flotilla (l 1 Submarines),One Flotilla (18 Destroyers),One Squadron i^Light Cruisers),with the necessary Depot Ships, Oilers, Ammunition Ships,Minelayers, Seaplane Carriers, &amp;c.

Loss of FrenchDestroyer.T.B.D. &quot; Cheerful.&quot;T.B.D. &quot; Cossack.&apos;Affair at Hodeida.The United Statesof America.Battle Fleet.Military Mission.Naval Mission.Ireland.17. The First Sea Lord reported the loss by the French of a destroyer torpedoed off Messina.18. The First Sea Lord reported that the old destroyer&quot;Cheerful&quot; had been mined off Lerwick on the 30th June, he feared with great loss of life.19. The Frst Sea Lord reported that the steamer &quot;Duchess,&quot;carrying ammunition, and possibly guns, had collided with the destroyer &quot; Cossack,&quot; cutting off the stern of the latter andcausing her depth charges to explode, with the result that the&quot;Duchess&quot; sank.   The destroyer had been towed to Dover.20. The First Sea Lord stated that the Commander-in-Chief,East Indies, reported having bombarded Hodeida as a result of areport that there were some British and native prisoners there.21. The First Sea- Lord stated that he had discussed with admiral Sims the possibility of American battleships being sentover to join the Grand Fleet. The difficulty was that, owing to shortage of oil-fuel, we could only have some of the older type of american battleships, which were coal-burning.22. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff alluded to thepoint he had raised previously, that the Foreign Office should communicate with the United States Government as to whether an american Military Officer should come to us and a British military officer should be sent to America. According to the latest informa-tion he had received, however, he gathered that the United StatesGovernment did not want to have a British Officer in America asa Military Representative.In view of the information conveyed by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice,and the report received by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,the War Cabinet decided Not to send a British Military Mission to the United Statesuntil it was asked for, but that there was no objection toa Military Mission from the United States being received in this country.That a specially selected officer should be sent to the UnitedStates as Military Attache.23. In regard to a Naval Mission to the UnitedStates, the first sea Lord stated that, so far as his information went, he thought aBritish Naval Mission would be welcomed by the Americans.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should communicate with the. American Ambassador wdth a view to getting theUnited States Government to ask for a British NavalMission to be sent to America.No.24. The Secretary of State for War read extracts from a letter,G.2559/1 of the 25th June, written by the Commander-in-chief in Ireland to the Field-Marshal Commander-in-Chief home forces, reporting a very bad state of affairs. This letter con-tained references to manifestations of disloyalty  shown  in  the
Aerial Policy. 25. In reference to its previous decision (War Cabinet 163,Minute 14), the War Cabinet had under consideration the Note onAerial Policy by the Secretary of State for War, dated the 26th June,1917 (Paper G.T.-1198) (Appendix).In the scheme put forward, the sanction of the War cabinet was asked for an increase, to commence at once, of the establishmentof the Royal Flying Corps from 108 to 200 service squadrons, withthe necessary aerodromes and establishment, and for a progressiveincrease in the output of aero-engines to 4,500 a month, includingcertain supplies from overseas.The War Cabinet approved the expansion of the Royal FlyingCorps establishment, and the increase in material proposed ;and also of a corresponding expansion and increase of theRoyal Naval Air service.In connection with the supply of aero-engines in America, theMinister of Munitions stated that, in order to increase the commonoutput, certain types of British machines, aero-engines, and theiraccessories, had been selected fur manufacture in the United States,and that these had been sent over. He wished to explain, however,that there were in some cases jealously-guarded patent rights andtrade secrets in connection with th^se engines, and that he had promised that the Government would undertake to safeguard theinterests of the British manufacturers concerned in them. his proposal was that the British Government should be responsible forany financial disbursements necessary to this end for the duration ofthe war, and that the Government of the United States should be, similarly responsible after the war. If the British Governmentsresponsibilities were limited as suggested, it would greatly eliminate the chance of any disputes or haggling which might otherwise occur,and entirely avoid the possibility of any misunderstanding arisingowing to the incidence of the Excess Profits Tax, under which itmight be alleged that the payments that were being made were, asa matter of fact, being paid indirectly into the Treasury.The War Cabinet decided that The British Government should be responsible, during the war,for any financial arrangements to be made with the Britishowners of patent rights in the aero-engines, machines, andtheir accessories which were to be manufactured in theUnited States, and that the American Government shouldbe responsible for such arrangements after the war.(Initialled)      M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 2, 1917.meetings which assembled to welcome the amnestied rebels, and various other signs of disaffection, which was increasing. TheCommander-in-Chief in Ireland considered that the force af his disposal was ample to quell any outbreak, should it occur, but atthe same time thought it his duty to point out the dangerous natureof the situation. He had sent a copy of his letter to the chief secretary for Ireland.The War Cabinet decided to ask The Chief Secretary for Ireland to prepare a report on thematter for immediate submission to the Prime Minister onhis return.
APPENDIX.G.T.-1198. - *Aerial Policy.Note by the Secretary of State for War.87/304. &apos; &quot;      .IN obedience to the instructions from the War Cabinet 163 (14), a meeting washeld in the War Office, at which Dr. Addison, representing the Ministry of Munitions,Lord Cowdray, representing the Air Board, the Secretary of State for War and theChief of the Imperial General Staff, representing the War Office, were present.
