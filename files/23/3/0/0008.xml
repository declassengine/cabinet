THE War Cabinet resumed the discussion adjourned fromC^oTmiS^ the Me?tinS on the Previous day (War Cabinet 160, Minute 16).The main arguments for and against publication of the Report werebriefly recapitulated and, where necessary, emphasised, and certain further arguments were advanced in support or in criticism of the conflicting points of view.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, while hewas in no way disposed to press his point unduly, he was opposed to publication for the following reasons : In his opinion it was highly understandable to focus public attention upon the grievous mistakes ofthe past, more especially as everything tended to show that the drastic and comprehensive measures adopted to remedy the deplorablestate of affairs that had existed during the earlier stages of the campaign had proved eminently satisfactory, while the presentconduct of our operations in that theatre left little, if anything, to be desired. The Report would open up a very wide field of criticism which would not be confined to Indian administration since the war broke out, but would extend over the last ten years and would bedirected against successive Secretaries of State, Viceroys, andCommanders-in-Chief. So long as the War was in progress he hadgrave doubts of the expediency of opening up so large a question.The present. Government in this country stood on firm ground.They had nothing to conceal and nothing to fear. He was inno way convinced by the representations made on the previous[1365-161]Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1917..
2day, on the analogy of the Dardanelles Report, nor, did heregard either the Mesopotamia Commission or the Military authorities as specially qualified or fully competent .to judge any question ofpolicy, the determination of which must rest with the government alone. His own belief was that the Government would be well advised to take Parliament frankly and unreservedly into their confidence at a Secret Session of both Houses; to tell the completestory of the horrors which the Report revealed ; to say that thesehorrors were all past history, and to assure Parliament that theywere confident that there was no possibility of their recurrence ; to describe the present satisfactory state of affairs in Mesopotamia, sofar as the conduct of operations and military and administrativeserviees were concerned; and to impress upon Parliament that thepublication was untimely, unnecessary, and, at the present juncture,impolitic, as it would inevitably shock the public, our Colonies, andour Allies ; it would further depress the war-weary, it would give ahandle to the unpatriotic, the pacifist and the agitator, and it mightdefinitely place in opposition to the Government that particularportion of the press which had always given only grudging andlukewarm support to the War.The First Lord of the Admiralty, who had originally pressed inthe House of Commons for the appointment of the Dardanelles and theMesopotamia Commissions, concurred in Mr. Balfours view, and agreed that a full and frank statement to Parliament in secret session would, they might reasonably hope, persuade both Housesthat publication before the conclusion of the War was inadvisable.On the other hand, it was urged that a Secret Session would afford no escape from the difficulty; that the Commission hadexpressly prepared a Report in a form suitable and designed for publication, and that there was a statutory obligation to lay theReport before Parliament as soon as possible, while a special clause of the Act of 1916 necessitated publication as soon as the medicalinquiry was completed. It was again submitted that parliamentary and public pressure would prove irresistible ; that most of the factswere already known to a large portion of the nation, through the medium of private letters and personal statements of officers andmen who. had returned from Mesopotamia; that the House ofCommons had grown more and more out of touch with the electorate ;and that a statement in Secret Session would consequently not allay,but only excite suspicion in the country.In support of the view that the contents of the Report mighthave a disastrous, or at least an alarming, effect not only on theBritish nation, but also upon Colonial and Allied opinion, especially at a time when signs were not wanting that national enthusiasmeverywhere needed stimulating, it was suggested that the PrimeMinister of Canada in particular would be highly embarrassed by thepublication at the very moment when he was concentrating all his efforts upon his endeavour to introduce conscription in the Dominion.It was also suggested that, in any future difficult military situation,the publication of the Report, might lead the troops to distrust theHigher Command and to think that there was a repetition ofthe strategical faults which are criticised in the Report. It was further pointed out that ,this was the only country which took the view that publication of. documents of this character was desirable or even permissible in war time; and that no FrenchGovernment would dream of revealing to their nation the breakdown of the French medical arrangements during their recent offensive.In regard to the reflections contained in the Report on the-present system of government in India, the Secretary of State forIndia laid stress on the urgent necessity, of very early action being taken by the War Cabinet in regard to the question ofIndian reforms. The Report was a powerful indictment of atleast  one branch of Indian administration, and   both  at   home
and in India there was a strong and increasing feeling that a thorough overhauling and reconstruction of that system were necessary. In his opinion, and in that of the present Viceroy, itwas essential that the British Government should take the matter inhand at once and announce without delay the measures they proposed to take, in order to reassure and satisfy the public in thiscountry, and in India especially, where there were symptoms of growing impatience and unrest. The Viceroy had, only that morning, made an appeal to him to urge upon the War Cabinet thenecessity of prompt action.The Prime Minister agreed that the matter should be consideredby the War Cabinet at the first convenient opportunity.The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the discussion until their Meeting on the following day. In the meantime the Prime Minister undertook tosee Lord George Hamilton, the Chairman of theCommission, that afternoon, and to discuss generally thequestion with him ; and also to consider whether it wouldbe possible, by private consultation with certain membersof the House of Commons who might be regarded as political barometers, to ascertain beforehand the probable attitude of the Commons if the proposal to take bothHouses into the confidence of the Government by a frankstatement were adopted, and if the Government left thequestion of publication during the war to be decided byParliament in Secret Session.The War Cabinet further decided that The Law Officers of the Crown, and the Judge Advocate-General,should be asked for their legal opinion as to the properaction which should be taken, under Civil and Military Lawrespectively, if the Cabinet considered that proceedingsshould be instituted against the several officials mainly anddirectly responsible for the gross and culpable mal-administration revealed in the Report. The secretary was provisionally instructed to take the necessary steps togive effect to this decision.-2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,June 12, 1917.
