Director of Military Intelligence informed the War Cabinet that nomunitions were at present en route to Russia.The War Cabinet considered that it was most undesirable thatthe Russians should be led to entertain any idea that we were disposed to give them up, and evidence was advanced which indicated that a great deal of dissatisfaction already existed incertain circles. To enable the War Cabinet better to appreciate theexisting arrangements Lord Milner undertook to provide the Cabinet with a statement showing what tonnage had been allocated for shipmentsduring the next two or three weeks.British East Africa. 2. In continuation of War Cabinet 194, Minute 9, the Directorof Military Intelligence stated that the Commander-in-Chief inIndia had reported that he was sending two Indian battalions to[1365-195]
British East Africa as soon as shipping Avas available in relief oftwo other battalions that required rest. General Macdonogh furtherstated that the Commander-in-Chief in India had been requested toprovide the personnel and equipment for one cavalry regiment, and application had been made to the Union Government to supply thenecessary horses.The &quot;Western 3. With reference to War Cabinet 194. Minute 10, the Director(French) Front. of Military Intelligence gave a comparison between the fighting atthe Chemin des Dames and that which had taken place at Verdunlast year. With regard to the former, he stated that the fightinghad been very heavy since the French had occupied the high groundon the Craonne Ridge ; that the Germans had made no less thanseventy counter-attacks since &quot;the 5th May, and that out of the lasteighty days engagements had taken place on fifty-three of them.With the exception of the attack on the Sth July, in which parts ofthree divisions had been engaged, the majority had been on a short,front of about 1 kilometre, usually carried out by the German assaultdetachments, supported by ordinarj^ troops. At Verdun, in thei heaviest attack, no less than ten divisions took part, though the totalnumber of divisions which had been engaged on the two frontsduring the first eighty days was the same, namely, twenty-nine.The main difference in the character of the two attacks was that atVerdun the Germans were on the offensive and the French were unable to abandon the town (the vicinity of which was a pronouncedsalient) on account of the moral effect its loss would have had onthe French nation. In the German attacks on the Chemin clesDames the Germans were really on the defensive, and, apart fromthe desire to recover good observation posts, were, continuing toattack with a view to prevent the French from attacking elsewhere.General Macdonogh added that the German casualties on theChemin des Dames may have&quot;amounted to 100,000 ; and, although he had no definite information to guide him, the French casualties were probably less.The Eastern Front. 4.

General Macdonogh stated that a telegram had been receivedfrom General Ballard, at Jassy, that the situation there was nonetoo favourable, and that both the Russian and Roumanian troopsappeared to be desirous of seizing any opportunity to delay theiroffensive, which had originally been timed to take place on the10th July.6. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported engagements with two enemy submarines, both of which may possibly have been successful.7. Attention was called to the statement quoted in the Houseby Mr. Dillon that thousands of British troops from the Salonicafront were undergoing penal servitude or imprisonment.The Director of Military Intelligence was requested to send tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer at the House of Commons,as soon as possible, a true statement of the facts.Rouniania.Submarines.Greece.Shipping Losses.8.
