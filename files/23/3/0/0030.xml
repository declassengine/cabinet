THE War Cabinet considered the Terms of Reference to theproposed Court of Enquiry (War Cabinet 180, Minute 18, and WarCabinet 181, Minute 17).The Secretary of State for War said that this question had been referred to the Army Council, who had been advised by the Attorney-General and the Judge Advocate-General to confine the Reference,so far as they were concerned, to questions affecting persons subjectto Military Law. The Army Council accordingly proposed thefollowing:  &quot; (1.) The Court are required to enquire into the allegationscontained in the Report of the Mesopotamia Corn-mission adversely reflecting upon the conduct of any military officer, and to report upon such conduct.&quot; (2.) The Court are at liberty, when in their opinion thecircumstances justify them in so doing, to dealseparately, in advance, with the case of any officer orofficers, and to make a separate report with reference tosuch officer or officers.[1365-182] B
&quot; (3.) The case will he presented by the Law Officers of theCrown, or by Counsel nominated by the Attorney-General.&quot; (4.) All parties interested will be entitled to be represented by counsel.&quot;It was pointed out that such a Reference was impossible by itself, as it was inconsistent with the statements (Appendix) made inParliament that afternoon by the Lord President of the Council andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer. It had been expressly declaredthat the Government are strongly of opinion that the conduct of the civilians involved should be enquired into and dealt with as well asthat of the military officers. In order to give effect to this declaration,the alternative courses open to the Government were : -(a.) To try the military officers by court-martial, which wouldinvolve an Act deferring the operations of the statute of Limitations and much consequent delay, and to dealwith the civilian officials by means of a special statutorytribunal set up by Act of Parliament ;or,(b.) To take advantage of the existing Army (Courts of inquiry) Act, 1916.The Cabinet considered the conditions under which the Act of1916 was drawn up and presented to the Plouse, as well as theconstruction to be placed upon the word &quot; character&quot; as it appears in the Act, and they held the view that any Court assembled under that Act -was enabled to take evidence on oath, to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to report adversely or otherwise uponthe conduct of all persons concerned, both military and non-military.The Cabinet fully realised that it was essential that no risk shouldbe run of invalidating the Court, but were satisfied - that the precedent established by the Barrett case fully justified theirintended action regarding the Court of Inquiry now proposed.The War Cabinet, therefore, decided that The case would be met if the Terms of Reference were amended as follows, in order to make them apply to all persons,whether subject or not to military law :(1.) The Court are requested to inquire into the allegation-tions contained in the Report of the mesopotamia commission adversely reflecting upon the conductof any military officer, and to report upon suchconduct, and so far as persons not subject to military law are involved in such adverse reflec-tions, to report upon the coJiduct of such persons :(2.) The Court are at liberty, when in their opinion thecircumstances justify them in so doing, to dealseparately, in advance of their- Final Report,with the case of any such persons, and to makea separate report with reference to such persons :(3.) The case will be presented by the Law Officers ofthe Crown, or by Counsel nominated by the attorney-General:(4.) All parties interested will be entitled to be repre-sented by Counsel.Lord Derby stated that the Army Council were unwilling thatanv persons not subject to military law should be examined andtheir conduct reported on by a Coxvrt assembled by order of that council, as they doubted the legality of such procedure ; he under-took, however, with the assistance of the Attorney-General, to lay

The War Cabinet discussed the position of Lord Hardingeof Penshurst, who, on vacating the Viceroyalty of India, had taken up the appointment of Permanent Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that lord hardinge had. recently tendered his resignation, which Mr. Balfoursaid he had not accepted.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 12, 1917.[1365-182] B 2Lord Hardinge&apos;position.the opinion of the Cabinet before them, with a view to the necessary orders &quot;to assemble the Court being issued by the Army Council,provided the Council could be assured of the legality of this procedure. &quot;
. APPENDIX.Statement made in both Houses of Parliament regarding Disciplinary Action proposedby Government in consequence of the Report of the Mesopotamia Commission.ON the receipt of the Mesopotamian Report it was at once considered by theGovernment, and their legal advisers were asked to examine it and report upon it tothe Cabinet. This examination, which included not only the study of the Report but of a great deal&apos; of the evidence, necessarily took up much time, and it was only thisweek that this Report was received.The Government have been confronted with difficulties of a somewhat unusualcharacter in deciding how to deal with the Report. They felt strongly that the matter could not be left where it is, and that further action was necessary in regard to thepersons whose conduct had been impugned in the Report. This is necessary not onlyin the public interest, but in the interest of the persons themselves.The difficulty which met the Government was that of finding a judicial body before which these persons, who include both soldiers and civilians, could be brought. It mustbe borne in mind that the Mesopotamia Commission itself was not a judicial body. its proceedings were not conducted under any recognised code, and the Government areinformed by their legal advisers that the rules of evidence were not in all casesobserved. Further, by article 4 of the Special Commissions (Dardanelles and mesopotamia) Act, witnesses are fully indemnified against any use of their evidence inany subsequent proceedings against them. .. Any proceedings against the persons concerned therefore have to be commenced de novo, and to be based on evidence givenentirely independently of the Commission. To act by any method of summary jurisdiction would be to condemn men who had not been tried, and in case of protestit would be impossible to refuse a court-martial.There were two objections to procedure by court-martial. The first was thatcivilians could not be brought before such a court, and the Government are strongly of opinion that the conduct of the civilians involved should be dealt with as well asthat of the military officers. The second objection is the serious but unavoidabledelay arising from procedure by court-martial. Under the rules of procedure, before a court-martial can be convened a case must be established and a summary of evidencetaken on oath. For reasons already given, the evidence taken before the mesopotamia commission could not be TJsed for this purpose. The Government were assured thatthe compilation of the summary of evidence alone might occupy many months, owingto the distances from which many of the witnesses would have to be brought. Beforethe summary of evidence could be completed the statute of limitations, which in casesof this kind prescribes three years, wotdd have expired and no trial could take place.In these circumstances the Government decided that a judicial inquiry into theconduct of all the persons concerned is necessary in the interests of justice, and thatthe machinery most sintabie for this purpose is that provided by the Army (Courts of inquiry) Act, 1916.As regards the officers involved, the Army Council has determined to assemble aCourt of Inquiry pursuant to section 70 of the Army Act.As the evidence before such Court necessarily brings under review the conduct ofpersons not subject to military law, it is proposed to provide for the inclusion as members of the Court in pursuance of the Army (Courts of Inquiry) Act, 1916, ofpersons who are not officers. It is intended that the Court should consist of threeofficers and two persons who hold or have held high judicial office, one of whom shallbe President.All parties interested will be entitled to be represented, the expenses beingdefrayed out of piiblic funds. The case will be presented by the Law Officers of theCrown or by Counsel nominated by the Attorney-General.The proceedings will be open to the public except in so far as the public interestin the opinion of the Court may require that they should be conducted in private.The Army Council cannot take disciplinary action on the Report of the mesopotamia commission, because Parliament in settnig up the Mesopotamia Commission expresslyprovided that the statements made.by witnesses before it should not be used against them hereafter in any criminal proceedings or court-martial, and because the officers
-whose conduct is impugned were not afforded an opportunity of being present through-out the proceedings when evidence affecting their military character or reputation wasbeing given, or of cross-examining witnesses or of making a statement or producingwitnesses in their defence after knowledge of the charges against them.The Government having considered the Reference of the Army Council to theCourt of Enquiry, have decided to request the same Court to enquire into and report upon persons not subject to military law who are affected by the Report.o
