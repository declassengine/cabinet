Ireland.1. WITH reference to the letter from the Commander-in-chief in Ireland, read at the Meeting on the previous day (War Cabinet173, Minute 24), and circulated to the War Cabinet (paper g.T.-1242), the War Cabinet decided that-(a.) The Secretary should ask the Chief Secretary for ireland to invite the Lord Lieutenant, the Commander-in-Chief,and the Head of the Royal Irish Constabulary to cometo London at once, in order to give the War Cabinet thebenefit of their views on the present condition ofIreland.(b.) Lord Curzon should inform Lord Midleton, who was understood to have information to communicate inregard to Ireland, that the War Cabinet would be willing to see him at 3t6 p.m. on Wednesday, 4th July.Submarines.2. The First Sea Lord reported the following engagements with enemy submarines: The special service vessel &quot;Penshurst&quot;reported having engaged a submarine about 100 miles west of theScillies. In spite of sixteen hits on her hull and conning-tower,the submarine, though apparently unable to submerge, steamedaway on the surface ; information had not yet arrived whether she had been found by other vessels warned as to her whereabouts.The special service vessel &quot; Gaelic &quot; also reported an engage-ment in which she hit a submarine.The steamer &quot;Fernleaf &quot; reported having been chased by a submarine carrying two guns, 870 miles West of Finisterre. Thiswould seem to confirm the report that the United States convoy hadbeen attacked in that region previously. The First Sea Lordmentioned that Admiral Sims was of the opinion that information asto the intended route of the convoy had leaked out in America andhad been transmitted to Germany.Communication ofNaval information to Admiral Sims.3. The War Cabinet left to the Admiralty full discretion toshow all information as to losses, estimates of new construction, andother kindred matters, to Admiral Sims, the United States naval representative in this country.Communication ofEeports of theIntelligenceBureau to Mr. Page.4. The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send the SpecialReports of the Intelligence Bureau, Department ofInformation, but not the Eastern and Western Reportsprepared in the War Cabinet Offices, to the United states ambassador in this country.Proposed Agree-ment between the major entente powers regardingDefence againstMaritime Attack.5. With reference to the proposed agreement between theGovernments of the Allied nations in regard to defence againstmaritime attack (War Cabinet 142, Minute 12, and War Cabinet165, Minute 9, Appendix II; Paper G.T.-1138, Appendix), theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked to be authorised tonegotiate confidentially with the United States on the basis, in thefirst instance, of an agreement between all the Allies.It was pointed out that the sending of a Japanese Mission tothe United States might make it easier to bring about the inclusionof Japan in the agreement.The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to open up negotia-tions on the basis suggested, and to report progress.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 3, 1917.Prohibition of In view of the undertaking given by the Prime Minister toHorse-racing. representatives of the -Jockey Club that the prohibition of racingwould be further considered at the end of June (War Cabinet 145,Minute N, and War Cabinet 144, Minute 14), the War Cabinetreviewed the situation.On the one hand, it was agreed that the prospects of the food-supply had distinctly improved since the matter was last considered.The imports of wheat and barley were such that at the end of ourown harvest there should be in the country a reserve of thirteen orfourteen weeks&apos; supply. As to oats, there was at present betweenfour and five weeks&apos; supply ; the weekly consumption was about42,000 tons, and about one-tenth of this was arriving weekly. Butthe increased consumption of oats contemplated if racing were resumed, was negligible in amount. It was also agreed to be important not to restrict unnecessarily or unduly the pleasures ofthe public at a time when the strain of the war was beingincreasingly felt, and when the end of the war was not yet in sight.On the other hand, it was recognised that a large section ofpublic opinion, especially iii Scotland, where racing has ceased,would be offended by the resumption of racing. It would also bevery undesirable to give any ground for thinking that economy inthe use of food was no longer necessary. Any slackening in that direction would lead at once to a great and perilous increase in consumption.The War Cabinet decided-(a.) To permit racing in England to be resumed from themiddle of July on a restricted basis, approximatelyforty days to close of racing season.(6.) To restrict racing to Newmarket, and such other places andon such days as are agreed between the War Office, theBoard of Trade, the Ministiy of Munitions, and theJockey Club.(c.) That railway companies should not be required to providespecial trains for conveyance of race-goers and racehorses.(d ) That suitable steps should be taken 1o prevent the running of motor-cars and taxi-cabs to race meetings.(c.) To increase the allowance of oats to 15 lb. a day to amaximum of 1,200 horses in training.The Prime Minister undertook to convey the decisionof the War Cabinet to the representatives of the JockevClub.
APPENDIX.G.T.-1138. -- *Future Naval Construction in the United States.(Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)I GATHER from the Minutes of the War Cabinet that I am supposed to have promised to prepare a statement about a suggestion, which I have put forward in orderto enable the American Navy Department to divert all their energies from the task ofbuilding capital ships which would be useless during the present war to theconstruction of destroyers and other anti-submarine craft which are urgentlyrequiredThe reason, and the only reason so far as I am aware, which prevents the navy department from carrying out this policy which they admit to be desirable so far asthe present war is concerned is that, when the present war is over, they may find themselves, with a much smaller fleet of capital ships than- they had originallydesigned to build, in the face of a German fleet (which will still be powerful, because it does not come out to fight its enemy) and a Japanese fleet (which has no enemy tofight). This, say the Navy Department, is too great a risk for America to run, andtherefore, however reluctantly, we are compelled to employ money, labour, anddockyard space on building ships which are admittedly useless for the war on whichwe are engaged.My suggestion is that for four years, i.e., for the time required to build new capital ships, America should have a right to call other fleets to her assistance, in caseof maritime attack.This suggestion may, however, take more than one form One of these would bea Treaty of mutual maritime defence between America and Great Britain alone. Thishas the immense advantage of being both simple and adequate, and I confess that, for.reasons of high policy, there is nothing I should like, more than a defensive alliance with America/even, for four years, as would be capable of extension and development,should circumstances prove auspicious. The objection to it arises out of our existingTreaty with Japan, it is quite true that there is no logical incompatibility between our actual Treaty with Japan and this suggested Treaty with America. Both aredefensive. If Japan attacked America, we should certainly, if appealed to. come toAmericans assistance ; while, if America attacked Japan, we should be under no Treatyobligation to join in the attack. All the same, I fear that any such simple Treaty with america might produce a very unpleasant feeling in Tokyo. It would be regarded, sofar as Anglo-Japanese relations are concerned, as the beginning of the end of an alliance which has already lasted twenty years, and has, on the whole, conduced tostability in international relations in the Far East. This is a danger not to be lightlyrun, and probably the best way of avoiding it indeed, the only way that occurs tome is to try to associate Japan from the beginning with the new arrangement.This would have the triple effect of allaying Japanese fears, of engaging Japanesesupport, and of advertising the Treaty as a protection against Germany. But if japan is brought in, and if Germany be marked out by the very terms of the Treaty as thePower against whom precautions have to be taken, how can we avoid asking france to join with America,- Japan, and ourselves ? And if we ask France, how can weavoid asking Italy ? Russia might possibly be excluded on the ground that hergeographical position would prevent her navy taking any important part in thestruggle. But this argument could certainly not be used against Italy ; and thoughthe performances of her fleet in the present war are not very impressive, jealousymight make her wish to join in an arrangement which would add to her dignity and involve very little risk.The above are the main arguments which have induced me to frame the proposed treaty in the form in which it has been circulated (G.T.-1090), but 1 am quite ready-to believe that some better form may occur to my colleagues, and I place my proposalbefore them in the definite and concrete form chiefly for convenience of discussion.(Initialled) A. J. B.Foreign Office, June 22, 1917.o
