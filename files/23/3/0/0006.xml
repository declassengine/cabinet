Restriction ofShipping to the atlantic.1. THE War Cabinet had before them a letter from the FirstLord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-95&apos;0)&apos;&quot;(Apperidix&apos;J, &apos;ih which&apos;&quot;be expressed doubt as to whether Minute 24 of War Cabinet 150exactly conveyed what was either decided or approved at the Meetingon the 30th May. He therefore suggested that it would be wisa toissue an amendment to the Minute, or an explanatory memorandumupon it.War Cabinet saw7 no reason to modify their previousThey considered, however, that this was not inconsistentThedecision,with theThe War Cabinet therefore decided thatsuggestion contained in Sir Edward Carson&apos;s letter.Without altering the previous ruling of War Cabinet 150,Minute 24, an additional instruction should be issued to theeffect that the. Departments should review their probablepurchases for, say, the. next twelve months ; they should see to what extent it would be possible to buy in America,without having to pay excessively; and should submit their purchasing programmes for the consideration of theTonnage Priority Committee.2. The War Cabinet also discussed the question of the desirabilityof communicating the above decision forthwith to the Dominions,India, and the Allies. Although the policy contemplated \yasone to which it was desirable to work as a standard, it was recognised that in practice the transfer of purchases would, for thepresent, be small, owing to the fact that North America would onlybe able to supply a portion of our needs, and that for this reason theeffect would, for the present, be comparatively small. On the otherhand, if information of this policy should leak out prematurely, pricesmight be raised against us in North America and the whole schemefrustrated.   It was therefore decided : To postpone the communication of this policy to theDominions, India, and the Allies until &apos; the further reviewof future purchases had beeu earned out and the probabledevelopments of the policy could be foreseen ; but thatthe Dominions, India, and the Allies should be fully informed before any definite steps %vere taken, and in sucha way as to prevent them from feeling they had not been consulted.Shortage of 3. The War Cabinet had before them two memoranda on this railway Material.     subject: (a ) By Sir A. Stanley (Paper G.T.-883).(6.) By Lord Derby (Paper G.T.-964).Lord Derby stated that the War Office were faced with animmediate need for not less than 560 locomotives, which could notbe supplied by either the&apos;Belgians or the French. The Americanlocomotives were unsuitable, owing to their size and the difference intheir couplings. It therefore seemed that the only way out of thedifficulty was to see if more locomotives could not be spared fromthe British railways.Sir Albert Stanley pointed out that there was no pool of loco-motives in this country upon which to draw; on the contrary, therewas a serious shortage of- materials for the necessary repairs andrenewals of permanent-way, locomotives, carriages, and waggons foruse on the railways in Great Britain.The War Cabinet therefore decided 
To submit the question to a Committee composed of Lord Milner (Chairman),The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of Munitions, andThe President of the Board of Trade,who should investigate the. shortage of railway material and report their decision to the War Cabinet in due course.Purchase by 4 The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thesrsKdSs?

APPENDIX.G.T.-950. -. Restriction op Shipping to the Atlantic.(Copy of a letter from Sir E. Carson to Sir M. TIankey.)My dear Hankey, June 5, 1917.I HAVE been looking into the Minutes of War Cabinet No. 150, Item 24,Restriction of Shipping to Atlantic, and I am not quite sure that the wording, wheninterpreted by those who were not at the meeting, exactly conveys what, was eitherdecided or approved.The Minute sets out that until the machinery for purchasing, &amp;c, was in working order the Dominions, India, and the Allies were not to be informed, and also that eachpurchasing Department should at once take the necessary preliminary steps to procureits further supplies as far as possible from the United States and Canada and limit itscommitments in other markets to the lowest possible level. This clearly can be read asauthority for taking executive action i,e., to set up machinery and to take preliminarysteps in the direction indicated. This cannot possibly be done without, it immediatelybecoming known to the Dominions, India, and the Allies, who are not to be told !The instructions that purchasing Departments are to limit their commitments inother markets to the lowest possible level might very legitimately be. taken asauthorising them to cancel long-running contracts, if they could do so upon reasonablyfavourable terms, and that would, of course, immediately give the policy away.The preliminary steps to limit commitments in other parts of the world would betaken&quot; as an instruction not to continue contracts or place new contracts, and to divertour purchasing to America. This would have the immediate effect of running themarket up against us, and would put America into the position of a favoured middleman.It would also have a very disturbing effect upon the financial situation, both in Americaand other parts of the world.What I really think the War Cabinet intended was that the Departments should review their probable purchases for, say, the -next twelve months, and should see towhat extent it would be possible to divert them to America without having to payexcessively, and that they should report thereon, but not take any executive action atthe moment. When their reports were received the matter could be further consideredby the War Cabinet and by the Shipping Controller and others concerned, includingthe new organisation which is being set up in America, and then we should be in aposition to see what could be done, and could consult as necessary with the Dominions,India, and the Allies.I suggest that as this Minute must necessarily have had a fairly wide distribution,and, if interpreted as I think it can be interpreted, will get into many hands, it wouldbe wise to issue an amendment of it or an explanatory amendment upon it.(Signed)      Yours sincerely,EDWARD CARSON.o
