THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff produced intelli-The Balkans. gence maps containing a list of the enemy divisions on the russian front, showing that at the time of the Russian offensive in Galiciathey consisted almost entirely of Austrian troops, but that since theenemy offensive they consisted mainly of German divisions, somehalf-dozen of which had been brought over from the Western front,and one division from the Balkan front, where only nine Germanbattalions remained.\ The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Russians^ were in some places in front and in others in rear of the line whichthey had hoped to hold. The Russians had already yielded some ground in Moldavia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to the difficult situation of the King of Roumania in the event of his beingdriven out of Roumanian territory and forced to reside in Russia,.C where a strong anti-monarchical spirit prevails.[1365--204]Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1917.
General Komiloff. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived a message from General Barter to the effect that he had found General KornilofFs army to be in a better state of disciplinethan any of the other Russian armies, and that he had great hopes that his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the russian armies would lead to the restoration of discipline and the regenera-tion of the Russian army.Armoured Cars. 3. The First Sea Lord reported  that  Commander  Locker-Lampson&apos;s fleet of armoured cars had been in the Russian retreat.All the personnel had been saved, but three cars had been lost andtwo others had been abandoned.Russian Railways.4. The War Cabinet considered telegram No. 1175 from theBritish Ambassador at Petrograd, giving a very pessimistic reviewof the military situation in Russia, stating that it is useless to expect any military assistance from Russia during the presentyear; and suggesting that, as the root of the whole evil lies indefective transport, the Allies should undertake a great scheme forthe reorganisation of the Russian railways.Mr. Henderson reminded the War Cabintet that the UnitedStates of America already had a technical railway mission inRussia, but that their experience hitherto had shown that theywould require a large staff in order that they might keep in touchwith the work they had initiated in the different sections of theline. There was no doubt that the Russian Government itselfought to take up the matter. Material was available, and skilled labour could be obtained from the Army. Up to now, however, theRussian Government had proved very &quot; touchy,&quot; and the powers ofthe United States Mission had proved insufficient.The War Cabinet, while approving Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s proposal in principle, agreed to the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs That the United States of America should be asked to under-take the task which the European Allies were unable todeal with. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a draft telegram to Sir C. Spring-Rice developing thispolicy, which was agreed to in principle.The British Ambassador in Petrograd should also - be asked toput pressure on the Russian Government to give greaterpowers to the United States railway experts.The British Ambassador in Petrograd should be informed, bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the british general de Candolle, who is finishing his work in roumania. might be employed, with his Staff, in theSouth-West of Russia.Clothing forEussia.5. As regards the possibility of taking any action to alleviate the shortage of winter clothing in the Russian Army, to which theBritish Ambassador at Petrograd had also drawn attention, theSecretary of State for War reported that nothing could be done, as,owing to the tonnage situation, we ourselves were suffering from ashortage of wool.The Secretary of State for War undertook to ascertain whetherassistance could be given to Russia from this country,India, or any other source.
The Western Front.Casualties.Effect of BritishOffensive.7. Mention having been made of false rumours in this countryto the effect that the offensive just commenced on the Western front had not realised the hopes anticipated of it, and to the fact that theGermans had decorated their cities on the ground that our armieshad not occupied the coast of Flanders : The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to give thePrime Minister material on the subject for a statement inhis speech on the following day.Naval Losses. 8. The First Sea Lord reported&quot; Ermine,&quot; which had been sunkmine or torpedo.the loss of the fleet-messengerm the Mediterranean either by german Outragein the case of the sinking of theSteamship&quot; Belgian Prince.&quot;9. The First Sea Lord gave details in regard to the sinking ofthe &quot; Belgian Prince.&quot; The Germans had taken forty men from thesteamer and placed them on the deck of their submarine. Theyhad smashed the lifeboats with hatchets and taken away the life-belts. They then submerged the submarine, leaving the Englishcrew to perish in the water. The facts of the case had been supplied by three survivors, who had succeeded in concealing theirlifebelts.The War Cabinet asked The First Sea Lord to take steps to publish particulars of theoutrage.Tonnage forConveyance of horses.10. With reference to War Cabinet 201, Minute 2, general smuts reported that, after meeting representatives of the War Office,the India Office, and the Ministry of Shipping, he had found that provision was required for the transport of 26,500 horses and12,500 mules, almost all of which would be wanted for the campaign of 1918 in Mesopotamia. He had decided that the necessarytonnage should be found by the Shipping Controller.The War Cabinet approved this decision.Proposed TransportConference.11. With reference to War Cabinet 198, Minute 12, the first sea Lord reported that Admiral Sims had informed him that theUnited States representatives to the Shipping Conference could not reach England by the 10th August, but that they would communi-cate the date as soon as possible. The Shipping Conference would therefore have to be postponed.Inter-Ally 12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that theConference in latest information at the Foreign Office was to the effect that theLondon. French representatives, who were coining to attend the conference would probably not arrive before Monday of the following week.The War Cabinet asked The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to notify BaronSonnino to that effect.6. The Secretary of State for War reported that the proportionof killed to wounded in the recent offensive was very small.
Salonica.The ForthcomingInter-AllyConference inLondon.13. The War Cabinet had a short discussion in regard to theattitude to be taken up by the British representatives at the forth-coming Inter-Ally Conference on the question of the Balkans. Itwas pointed out that there was a tendency among the variousPowers, and particularly the smaller nations, to oppose the with-drawal of one division, as proposed by the British Government atthe recent Paris Conference. *- Having regard to recent developments on the Russian and roumanian fronts, which render it highly improbable that anyoffensive is likely to be undertaken against Bulgaria from the Northduring the present year, and to further strategical reasons given bythe Chief of the Imperial General Staff in support of an earlyreinforcement in Palestine, the War Cabinet decided To adhere to their previous decision in favour of withdrawal ofone division and some heavy artillery from the Salonicafront.Palestine.14. It was suggested that, in view of the importance of an earlyreinforcement of our forces in Palestine, it might be advisable toinform the French Government that we were unable to delay actionfurther, and that, although we should be glad to discuss the matter again if they desired, we could not postpone longer than Mondaynest.   It was decided,-h^owever To take no action in this sense until Monday, when it would be definitely known whether the French intended to postponetheir visit again or not.General Sarrail. 15. The question was raised as to whether the War cabinet should at the Conference again press for the removal of general sarrail from the command of the Allied forces at Salonica (WarCabinet 155, Minute 5). Little doubt was felt that, if pressure were put on the French Government, this concession could be secured,though not without great opposition. It was suggested that, if weinsisted on the removal of General Sarrail, we should encounterstill greater opposition in regard to the one division, the removal ofwhich is required on strategical grounds. It was suggested that, as no offensive is likely to take place this autumn in the Balkans, therewas less objection than formerly to General Sarrail&apos;s retention of the command for the present, and that it might be better to postpone thematter for some more favourable opportunity. In this connection the suggestion was also made that it might be desirable to con-concentrate the whole of the Allied forces in the East Mediterraneanunder a British General, and that this would get over the difficultyas regards General Sarrail as well as that of moving our forces fromone Mediterranean theatre to another. The *Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff pointed out, however, that in existing conditions he ought to be free to move the British forces as the War cabinet approved, and this was generally agreed to.No definite decision was taken as to General Sarrail, and thematter was left to be raised, or not, according to the course of thediscussion at the Conference.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 3, 1917.
