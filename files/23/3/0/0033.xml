Man-Power :* 1. THE War Cabinet had under consideration &quot;The TenthTenth Report of the Report of the Director-General of National Service to the WarDirector-General of   Cabinet&quot; (Paper G.T.-1176).National Service. Mr. Neville Chamberlain stated that he still held to the opinionexpressed therein, that all Government exemptions should be cancelled in the case of men of the younger classes. He pointedout that he had set up an elaborate organisation throughout thecountry for providing substitutes to fLLl the vacancies caused by men called tip for service, but that few vacancies had been created, andthat consequently few substitutes were wanted. Unless the* Government were prepared to reverse their present policy in regardto the younger classes of men, he did not see that there was muchobject in the continued existence of his Department.Dr. Addison was of the opinion that it was too early .to judge of the working of the Report of Lord Rhondda&apos;s Committee (WarCabinet 103, Minute 2), the provisions of which, to all intents and purposes, did not come into operation until the 31st May, 1917.The process of conducting medical examinations and hearing-appeals, &amp;c, was slow, and, though a certain number of men were coming in, he could hold out no hope, as regards the Ministry ofMunitions, that the full quota of men asked for by the War office would be obtained. He considered that, although munition worksobtained men of all grades through the Labour Exchanges, theNational Service Department was useful as supplementing the workof those Exchanges.As to the procedure of substitution, it was pointed out that theLabour Exchanges were applied to, in the first instance, to furnish the substitutes required, and that if these Exchanges could not find the men the demand was passed on to the Director-General ofNational Service. In this connection Sir David Shackleton statedthat, out of 2,000 substitute vacancies which had been passed on tothe Director-General of National Service, only 34 substitutes hadbeen found. -He admitted that there was a prejudice against theLabour Exchanges on the part of several of the more powerful andhighly organised trades, and also that the demands for labour putforward by firms were often exaggerated and needed investigation.Mr. Neville Chamberlain said that he was unable to accept theabove statement as to the vacancies notified by the Minister ofLabour and filled by the National Service Department. His Depart-ment had been placing on an average over 600 volunteers a week invarious occupations. He added that the cream of his volunteers,including even general labourers, had been skimmed by trans-ference to the Labour Exchanges as potential War MunitionVolunteers, while the vacancies handed to him by the labour exchanges were those most difficult to fill.Mr. Prothero informed the War Cabinet that the agricultural committees usually applied to the Labour Exchanges. He admitted that this might be due to the fact that farmers preferred the cheapestlabour obtainable. In reference to the last paragraph of the TenthReport of the Director-General of National Service, he reported thatthe women obtained by the Board of Agriculture, with the help of^the National Service Department, were doing very good work, butthat their selection, training, and distribution had been carried outby the Board of Agriculture.Position as regards 2. Lord Milner stated that the question before the Cabinet,Recruiting. which was contained in the first four paragraphs of the TenthReport of the Director-General of National Service, really turnedupon the working of the schedule of groups to be released for* The discussion under Minute 1 was commenced at the Meeting of the WarCabinet held in the morning (War Cabinet 184), but was adjourned to the afternoon in order to enable representatives of the other Departments concerned in the questionof Man-power and Substitution to be present.
Ministry ofMunitions.3. Dr. Addison pointed out that the schedule of ProtectedOccupations (M.M. 130) had been designed to secure the release ofa number of young men, but that the agreement between theGovernment and the Trade Unions debars their release. Thisagreement lays clown that the dilutees of military age who are fit forgeneral service shall be released before any young man who is not adilutee is taken. No man over 32, dilutee or other, can be releasedunder the schedule, and the. Government promised to consult theUnions ^before any alteration of the schedule. However, even if,after consulting the Unions, the age is raised from 32 to 41, thepresence of dilutees in the absolutely protected trades of ship-building and marine engineering effectively prevents the workingof the original intention of the schedule and the release of any youngnon-dilutees. In regard to the Ministry of Munitions, he anticipatedthat some 30,000 men might be obtained instead of the 124,000required.   Of these about 11,000 had been released up to date.Coal-mines.4. The Coal Controller stated that up to date 16,560 men had been released out of the two quotas, each of 20,000, that were required..The policy followed had been to take only those younger men whohad entered the mining industry after the 4th August, 1914.   The[1365-185]B 2military service by Government Departments, which had been framed as the result of the Report of the Rhondda Committee. Itwas necessary therefore,&apos; in the first instance, to ascertain the actualsituation in figures in regard to the numbers of men released andposted .to the army under this schedule (Memorandum by the adjutant-General to the Army Council regarding the Position and prospects of Recruiting, May 31, 1917-Paper G.T.-965).On the subject of the general position of recruiting, GeneralGeddes stated that there were still 3,900,000 men of military age in civilian employment in Great Britain, of which a disproportionatelylarge number were amongst the younger classes. In his opinion,under the existing policy, the incidence of recruiting was upon the older men, many of whom were of the professional classes or hadbusinesses of their own, were manied and had reached a certainstage of independence ; whilst the younger men, the majority ofwhom were not married, and had not reached a stage of indepen-clence, but who had been caught in the factory system, were beingprotected. The latter contained a large number of Syndicalists,cowards, cranks of all sorts, and unskilled men. The policy being forced upon the War Office was, in his opinion, anti-national. Notonly were the Tribunals unsympathetic to it, but the feeling of thewhole country was growing more and more hostile to it as time went on. What was, in his opinion, still worse was that the present policy was providing unlimited grist for the Tjacifist, mill. he considered that there was no possibility of maintaining the armyunder the existing system, and that it was destroying the inde-pendent class of the nation and protecting those, not so worthy of being preserved. So much was this feeling shared by the tribunals that eleven of these bodies were actually on strike.Mr. Hayes Fisher endorsed the view that the Tribunals were anxious that the younger single men should be taken before the older married men, and stated that the question of the calling up ofthose conducting a one-man business might very shortly be raised in Parliament in a very acute form.The Adjiitant-General stated that he entirely shared GeneralGeddes&apos;s views, as did the Secretary of State for War. The classof men that the Army wanted was the younger men ; but so seriouswas the recruiting situation, as far as mere numbers were concerned,that the Army authorities could not afford.to reject any man theycould legally obtain, however old he might be.
whole of the number required could not be obtained by these means,and arrangements were now being made with the Miners&apos; federation to obtain the balance by ballot. There was a certain amount ofunemployment in the anthracite trade, and in Northumberland andFife. In the last-named area an average of four days&apos; work a week was being done, but owing to the demand for increased output inthe Midland coalfields it may be necessary to get miners from Fifeand Northumberland to move to that area. The figures recently made public in Parliament in regard to South Wales, however,were inaccurate. He undertook that the full quota of 42,000 men would be furnished, but explained that there would be some delay in de-certifying men selected by ballot.General Geddes stated that there were a little over 500,000men of military age employed in the mines, and that the minesformed one of the largest pools which the Recruiting authorities might have at their disposal. He urged that, in order to expeditematters, all miners under a certain age should be de-certificatedforthwith, on the understanding that those subsequently selected byballot to complete the quota would be called up.The Coal Controller undertook to consult the Miners&apos; federation and to report by Wednesday next.Railways andDocks.5. Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith gave the figures for the men released from Railways and Docks (a summary of which is includedin the table given below), and in regard to dock labour emphasised the difficulty that had arisen as the result of the increased employ-ment of the Western ports, and owing to the opposition of theTransport Workers&apos; Federation to the release of men.Police and CivilService.8. In regard to the quotas to be furnished by the Police and civil Service, General Geddes expressed himself as satisfied thatthe men would be forthcoming.Other Certified 7. In regard to ihe 40,000 men in occupations other than thoseOccupations. specifically detailed in the schedule, General Geddes intimated that none of these men would be available till September, but that he hoped to get a fair number by October. He doubted whether morethan 10,000 men in all would be obtained under this head.Substitution. 8. In reply to Lord Milner, Mr. Neville Chamberlain pointedout that the number of substitutes required would not necessarily be as many as the number of men released. He estimated that thenumber of substitutes that would be required to be found by his department to fill the places of men released would be between100,000 and 150,000.It was pointed out to the War Cabinet in this connection thatthere was more unemployment at the present time than there hadbeen at any time since September, 1914, and that the presentoutlook in the woollen trade, owing to the curtailment of rawmaterials, would probably shortly bring about a considerabledisplacement of labour. Mr. Hodge informed the War Cabinet thatthere was a strong feeling amongst the labour classes in the country that the Government had been weak in its treatment of the recruitingproblem, and that if any good result was now to be achieved itwould be necessary for the Government to retrace its steps and consider the question of exemption de novo.
