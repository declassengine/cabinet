With reference to War Cabinet 153, Minute 1, relative tothe agricultural programme for 1918, the question of the supply ofphosphate rock was brought to the notice of the War Cabinet, andit was pointed out that 50,000 tons a month would require to be imported.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Shipping Controller should provide the necessarytonnage, at Blue Book rates whenever possible, but when a neutral ship has to be chartered such shoidd bedone at the best rates obtainable.(b.) All such freights should be charged to the Ministry ofMunitions, which Department should take steps for themanufacture of superphosphate and issue it to the Boardof Agriculture at a rate of 51. per ton.Greece: 3. Lord Robert Cecil informed the War Cabinet that a telegramAbdication of King had just been received to the effect that Prince Alexander took theConstantine. oath as King of Greece yesterday afternoon and that the late King Constantine was proceeding to Switzerland and would be embarked on a British man-of-war at an early date.The War Cabinet decided that An announcement of the accession of King Alexander shouldbe made in both Houses of Parliament this afternoon andthe opinion expressed that it was hoped that the change would make for the unity of Greece and the fullconstitutional government of that country.The War Cabinet requested The First Sea Lord to instruct the British Vice-Admiral inthe Mediterranean to take the necessary steps for theembarkation of the late King, after consultation with theFrench naval Commander-in-Chief, and desired the ForeignOffice to inform the French and Italian Governments ofour action in this matter.British Troops forCorinth.4. AVith reference to War Cabinet 160, Minute 12, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that the British detachment of 500men embarked yesterday for Corinth.Development of western Ports.5. The War Cabinet considered the Report of Lord Milner(Appendix II) on the development of the western ports of the UnitedKingdom.The War Cabinet approved the proposal that The Ministry of Shipping should be authorised to develop thepolic.y of the extended use of the western ports of Englandand Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and to carry out, subjectto Treasury sanction, such improvements as may be foundnecessary.
Portugal:Contingent for france.7. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat an aeroplane raid was taking place, and that there was areport that Poplar and Woolwich had been attacked.The War Cabinet requested him, as soon as full particulars hadbeen received, to forward a report to the Leader of the House ofCommons so that a statement might be made there this afternoon,and authorised Lord Derby to make a similar statement in the Houseof Lords.Prisoners Captured 8. With reference to War Cabinet 154, Minute 13, the statement&quot;by the Enemy. ^y the Germans that they had captured 12,500 prisoners duringthe month of May was further considered by the War Cabinet,and it was pointed out by the Secretary of State for War that, whencasualties were reported, such casualties included those who were killed, wounded, and missing, and that &quot;missing &quot; further includedthose who had been taken prisoner. He explained that it wasimpossible to check, for some time at any rate, the actual prisonerslost in any engagement.The War Cabinet requested The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to ask the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief in France to provide theWar Cabinet from time to time with the facts as to the losses as regards prisoners when such information couldbe definitely stated.Aeroplane Raid.6. With reference to War Cabinet 158. Minute 2, the First sea lord pointed out that he did not consider that further Britishtransports could be spared to move the balance of Portuguese troopsrequired to complete their second division in France, and suggestedthat they should use their own transports, the &quot; Gilleaneas &quot; and the&quot; Pedro Nunez,&quot; for this purpose, and stated that he was preparedto provide two destroyers to escort those ships from Lisbon to Brest,and vice versa. He further added that it was probable, if british transports were sent, it would mean that they would have tobe taken from those allotted for the transport of British troops to egypt. He further pointed out that the Portuguese Governmenthad not by any means made the fullest use of the transports that had hitherto been placed at their disposal.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the french had provided the Portuguese with 75&apos;s, and that the feeling in portugal was very strong with regard to our refusal further toassist them in connection with the transfer of the troops they haddetailed for the Western Front. Pie further stated that thePortuguese troops had proved that they possessed more value than had been anticipated, and that further contingents could be utilisedwith advantage.In view of the statements of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff and the fact that man-power is a serious question with us, theWar Cabinet requested The First Sea Lord to arrange with the Shipping Controller for*   the loan of two British transports to convey the remainder of the second Portuguese Division to Brest; and desired the former to detail two destroyers as escort.The War Cabinet further requested The Foreign Office to inform the Portuguese Government thatthese ships were loaned on the distinct condition that theirpassenger and cargo space was fully utilised, and requestedAdmiral Jellicoe to draft the necessary telegram and sendit to the Foreign Office for transmission.
General Wilson.9. The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for War to withdraw General Sir Henry-Wilson from the appointment as Liaison Officer in France,which he had held on the recommendation of the WarCabinet, to meet the special request of General Nivelle.The War Cabinet expressed the hope that the Secretary of Statefor War would take steps to give General Wilson another suitableappointment at an early date.H.M.S. &quot; Grafton.&quot; 10. The  First Sea Lord  informed   the War  Cabinet  that.M.S. &quot;Grafton.&quot; after being torpedoed, had safely arrived at malta. She was fitted with &quot;bulges,&quot; as protection against such form of attack, and he had received a report that, though three ofthe compartments in the &quot; bulge &quot; had been flooded, the hull was.entirely undamaged.Japanese DestroyerTorpedoed.11. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that one of&apos;the Japanese destroyers in the Mediterranean had been torpedoed,and the foremost part of the ship blown off.   She had, however,been safely brought into Suda Bay.   Her casualties were 55 killed,.13 wounded.United States 12. The First Sea Lord stated that the United States destroyer-Destroyer in &quot;Jenkins&quot; and the Fleet Sweeping Vessel &quot;Laburnum&quot; had beenCollision. jn collision, but that the damage done was not serious.German EastAfrica.13. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that a landing-party working in conjunction with H.M. Ships had proceeded up the River Lindi in German East Africa, with a viewto co-operation with the military forces on shore against the enemy.Submarines.14. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that a report.had been received from Falmouth that the armed trawler &quot; SeaKing,&quot; one of the Hydrophone Flotilla for hunting submarines, had dropped depth charges in the vicinity of a submarine off the Lizard,and that a series of further explosions had taken place as the result.Admiral Jellicoe was, consequently, of opinion that our attack had.been made on one of the enemy&apos;s mine-lajdng submarines.Convoys. 15. In reply to the enquiry of the War Cabinet as to theprogress of the convoy system, the First Sea Lord informed the WarCabinet that the only two British Convoys had been successful, butthat two Norwegian ships under our convoy had been lost. he stated that the convoy organisation was now nearly complete, andthat he hoped soon to start weekly convoys of oilers and provisionships.Sinking of German 16. The First Sea Lord reported the particulars of an engage-Submarine &quot;U 92.&quot; ment between one of our decoy ships of the latest pattern and theGerman submarine &quot; U 92,&quot; in which the decoy ship had been torpedoed and two or three men killed, but after highly praiseworthyaction on the part of the officer commanding and the crew of thedecoy ship the submarine had been sunk.
German allegations of GrossInhumanity.17. The First Sea Lord stated that the Germans were accusingus of gross inhumanity with regard to the saving of a portion of the crew of &quot; S 20.&quot; He read to the War Cabinet a letter which hadbeen written by one of the survivors to his relatives in Germany,which indicated that the treatment of the survivors had been all that could be desired, and he proposed to use the information containedin this letter to refute the base statements of the German authorities.Eeport of the. 18. The War Cabinet concluded their discussion on the mainMesopotamia question (War Cabinet 160, Minute 16, and War Cabinet 161,Commission.. Minute 1).    The principal  arguments   both  in  favour and indeprecation of publication were  again  traversed and  carefully considered.The point was pressed that, if the Cabinet decided that publi-cation was desirable and necessary, an announcement of this decision must be accompanied by a statement of their resolve that the responsible officials would be adequately dealt with, and by an assurance to the nation that they intended to take prompt andsummary action to this end.In regard to the disciplinary action that might be taken againstmilitary officials to whom the Array Act was applicable, theSecretary of State for War stated that the King could remove fromtheir appointments any officers who were declared by the ArmyCouncil to have been guilty of ctdpable neglect or misconduct, butthat such officers would be entitled in equity though not in law to appeal to be tried by Uourt-martial. This applied to officers of theRoyal Army Medical Corps, but he did not know whether it did toofficers of the Indian Medical Service. He was convinced that theArmy generally would strongly resent any officer being compelled to retire from the Service on the grounds that he had been declared by the Mesopotamia Commission to have been guilty of culpableneglect. Except under the provisions of Article 525 of the royal warrant for Pay, officers could only be dismissed from the service by sentence of Court-martial.It was urged that if publication were withheld and officers were proceeded against by Court-martial, they would be heard in open.Court, and this would involve the very publicity the opponents of publication were anxious to avoid. In any case, most of the factswere already notorious and common property ; the remainder were bound to leak out; and even if the Government, in pursuance oftheir announcement that they intended to punish the culprits, tookaction- against certain highly-placed officers, suspicion would bearoused and controversy engendered ; and it would be impossible to persuade the public that the Government were not shielding people in a still more exalted position. The matter had gone too faralready, and the nation would demand the full facts. publication would have a steadying effect on public opinion everywhere,especially when it was realised that the trouble had long since beeneffectually dealt with.. Nothing more serious need to be appre-apprehended than an unpleasant scandal of three weeks&apos; duration.The War Cabinet were reminded that Commander Wedgwood,.M.P., who had submitted a separate report of an outspoken andcritical nature, was a man of very independent character, who wasactuated by a possibly mistaken but virile conception of publicduty, even if he had a somewhat less acute sense of what might be-really in the public interest. It was most unlikely that he would readily respond to, or encourage his fellow-members to acquiesce in,any appeal to Parliament temporarily to release the government from their statutory obligation. The Government, no doubt, had reason to believe they stood on firm ground, but they might conceivably have to yield later to public pressure, which would weaken their position ; and the stability of the British Governmentwas a strong asset for the vigorous prosecution of the war.[1365-162] C
After trie most careful and prolonged consideration of thisquestion in all its aspects, the War Cabinet decided that (a.) The report should be published at the earliest convenient opportunity, together with the Vincent-Bingley report and the annexes to both documents.(6.) Having regard to the lapse of time and the difference inthe political and military situation in&quot; Mesopotamia sincethe events which came&quot; within the purview of theCommission, and, in view of the difficulties raised andsuspicions excited in consequence of the pmissiqhsdecided on in the case of the Dardanelles Report-, theexcisions recommended by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff were not of sufficient importance to justify their being accepted.The War Cabinet further decided that  .In the absence of the Prime Minister, no immediate steps need be taken to give effect to their decision of the previous day regarding the taking of the legal opinion of the LawOfficers of the Crown and the Judge Advocate-General.In arriving at that decision, they had only in view thedesirability of consulting expert opinion as to the judicial procedure which would be necessary to enable the Government to bring the responsible officials to book, and they were agreed that any more definite action demanded their further deliberation on the questionof policy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 13, 1917.
APPENDIX I.(G.T.-1006.)Control of Petrol and Petroleum Products.(Memorandum by Mr. Long with reference to War Cabinet 142, Minute 10.)Prime Minister,IN accordance with your instructions, I have investigated the question of thecontrol of petrol and petroleum products. .1 find everything in great confusion, andthere can he no doubt that the situation must be full of anxiety for some time.,. You desired me to deliver a decision. I therefore propose the arrangements setforth in the accompanying memorandum, and which have the assent of Sir albert stanley, Dr. Addison, and Captain Pretyman.I have looked into the question of petrol and found it necessary to include otherpetroleum products in my investigation. The Prime Minister agreed to my doing so. .I have discussed matters with the heads of the Departments and Committees concerned,and my proposals are generally agreed to. I have found great confusion andoverlapping and no direct responsibility. The difficulty which led to the present crisis has arisen through the existence of two independent Committees withcontradictory references and spheres of action that overlap, and the lack of any authority to decide between the Committees and Departments concerned.My decision is to cancel the references of the Petrol Committee and the interdepartmental Committee, and make a fresh start with the following organisation to deal with all petroleum products : 1. To set up four bodies, viz :(a.) An Interdepartmental Committee of representatives of all Departments nowrepresented on the present Committee, with the addition of the Board ofAgriculture. This Committee will be advisory to all Departmentsconcerned with petroleum products. It will collect information andco-ordinate Departmental action, but will have no executive functions.(b.) The Petrol&quot;Committee to be reappointed by the Board of Trade to regulate thedistribution of petrol for civil and industrial needs.(c.) The Pool Board, a voluntary combination of petroleum companies to economise man-power and material, under an independent chairman,appointed by the Government. This Board will, be placed under theBoard of Trade instead of. the Ministry of Munitions as at present.(d.) A Production Department to stimulate home production. This Departmentto be attached to the Ministry of Munitions.2. The chairman of the above bodies wiU constitute a Committee, under the presidency of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the discussion and settlementof difficulties.3. There will be a Controlling Authority to decide any dispute between departments or Committees, and to arrange for executive action which, in his opinion,ought to be taken by Departments concerned. The decision of the ControllingAuthority will be final on all matters, except in case of interference with the needs ofthe Fighting Departments, when he would refer to the War Cabinet. This ControllingAuthority will be the Secretary, of State for the Colonies. He will have a liaison officer to keep him in touch with all Departments and Committees concerned.I believe that this scheme, under which the distribution of petroleum products for civil and industrial needs at home will be brought under the Board of Trade, will(Initialled)W. H. L.June 11, 1917.Petrol and Petroleum Products.[1365-162]D
prevent a recurrence of the recent difficulties, and that it will ensure that a comprehensive view will be taken of all petroleum questions, and that the work of thevarious bodies set up will be properly co-ordinated and any approach to dead-lockprevented.(G.T.-1003.) APPENDIX II.Development of the Western Ports of the United Kingdom, &amp;c.(Report by Lord Milner.)THE War Cabinet desired me (War Cabinet, 126, Minute 6 (6), and War Cabinet130, Appendix Gr.) to report on the question of the diversion of traffic from the Easternto the Western ports of the United Kingdom, as far as practicable, and thedisembarkation, &amp;c., of supplies in the latter ports.2. In this connection I held a meeting at which representatives from theDepartments concerned were present. A large number of difficulties were pointed out and it was decided that a trial shipment of 2,000 tons of grain should be made fromone of the Western ports to London. This trial, however, has not up to the presentbeen found practicable.3. As the result of the meeting I vras convinced that it was imperative that an organisation should be set up by the Shipping Controller to find out as soon as possiblewhat each Western port can at present achieve : (a.)-i. As regards discharging in its various aspects.ii. As regards storage capacity of the several kinds.iii. As regards its railway facilities for the further transport of the imports.(6.) What the ports can be made to do under (a), (i), (ii), and (iii).(c.) The effect the use of the West Coast ports and their further development willhave on the distribution question for cities and towns in the vicinity of theEast Coast.(d.) What alterations are necessary to overcome the difficulties referred to at (c).1. To enable this and other minor matters that will arise in connection therewithto be carried out, I felt that.it was very desirable that a highly capable official shouldbe selected and that he, in association with a member of the Railway Executive shouldenquire into the matter and take such action as may be necessary at the earliestpossible moment.5. It will be seen from an Extract (Enclosure) from a Report from the Ministry ofShipping that the Shipping Controller concurs in this view and has taken the necessary steps with a view to utilising to the fullest possible extent the West Coast ports.I agree to his suggestion that the Ministry of Shipping should be given a free hand todevelop this policy in co-operation with all other Departments affected, and suggest thatthe War Cabinet should give them authority to proceed with such improvementsas may be necessary, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer asregards funds required for this purpose.6. The War Cabinet also desired me to report on the safety of the ports generally,and I therefore communicated with the First Sea Lord on this subject, and thefollowing is an extract from the letter 1 have received from him*: &quot; If a chart of the British Islands is examined it will be seen that a verylarge proportion of the ships bringing supplies into this- country have to passbetween a point near the Land&apos;s End and the North of Ireland, because thosebound to London and the southern East Coast ports pass near Land&apos;s End ontheir way up Channel, and the whole of the shipping bound to ports betweenLand&apos;s End and Glasgow must enter between those two points.&quot; It is therefore perfectly obvious that from the point of view of safety, whichis the main Admiralty consideration, the development of Western ports isessential, since every yard that a ship traverses after passing the Land&apos;s Endgoing up Channel means additional risk both on the outward and homewardjourneys.&quot; The risk to a ship on her way to her discharging port after passing Land&apos;sEnd may be considered as  (roportionate to the distance to be traversed if we
assume that the risk on all routes is the same. On.this assumption a ship would reach Liverpool at about the same risk as a ship reaching Beachy Head. If she were to discharge anywhere between Land&apos;s End and Beachy Head or Land&apos;s end and Liverpool we should be so much to the good, but if she goes beyond beachy head she is incurring added risks as compared with discharging at Liverpool.It is, however, fairly evident, I think, from statistics that the clangers to be encountered going up Channel are greater than those going to Liverpool, because,in spite of the fact that the patrols in the Channel are infinitely stronger thanthose en route to Liverpool, the losses are at least as heavy, and the coast is onewhich offers greater opportunities for minelaying.&quot;This expert view emphasises the need of the development of the Western ports.7. With reference to the Report of Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee (G.T.-495), I amof opinion that their proposals should generally be adopted on the principle that theIrish ports should deal, as far as practicable, with the whole of the imports required forconsumption, &amp;c., in Ireland, and that the Scottish ports recommended by the Committeeshould be developed to the fullest extent that may be found to be possible within thenext twelve months.(Initialled) M.June 11, 1917.Enclosure.The Shipping Controller has proceeded with his plans for dealing with theproblem. A. special branch of the Ministry of Shipping has been organised under mr. L. A. P. Warner, whose services have been lent by the Mersey Docks and HarbourBoard. The Port and Transit Executive Committee, which was set up by the late government and vested with executive power to deal with this and kindred matters, isnow located in the Ministry, and steps have been taken to secure effective co-ordinationof its work with that of the new branch. In this way a large and, it is believed,effective organisation has sprung into being under the direct control of the Ministry ofShipping, and the Admiralty having, from the standpoint of safety, expressed a definiteview in favour of the fullest possible utilisation of the West Coast ports, it is suggestedthat the War Cabinet should now give the Ministry of Shipping a free hand to developthis policy energetically in co-operation with the port, railway, and other authoritiesaffected.- It has become abundantly clear that, if substantial results are to be achieved,the port problem and the railway problem must be treated as one, the multiplicationof separate Committees avoided, and authority concentrated, as far as possible, in one department.Ministry of Shipping, May 30, 1917.
