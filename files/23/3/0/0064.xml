THE Master-General of the Ordnance supplied the WarCabinet with full particulars of the supplies of ammunitionavailable for the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, which he con-sidered satisfactory.Output of Heavy 2. A discussion followed as   to   the  comparatively  smallGuns. &quot;  supply of long-range guns and long-range howitzers available forthe various theatres of war, as compared with the original pro-gramme. It was pointed out that this shortage was due verylargely to the decision of the War Cabinet on the 20th December,1916 (War Cabinet 12, Minute 7), whereby the arming of merchant ships was rendered possible by diverting plant, originally intended for these long-range guns, to the manufacture of ships&apos;guns.
A suggestion was made that the War Cabinet should ascertain from the Admiralty whether there was any prospect,now that America, which was the third Naval Power in the worldfrom the point of view of capital ships, had entered the war, thatlong-range guns and ammunition for them might become avail-able from naval sources. It was pointed out that the possibilityof this depended upon the policy of the Admiralty, but it wassuggested that, if any of the older battleships and the armouredcruisers were to be laid up owing to the accession of naval strength due to the entry of the United States of America, anumber of 13.5-inch and 12-inch guns, as well as ammunition for them, might be released. It was stated that artillery expertshad expressed the view that long-range Naval guns might be use-ful in piercing the German concrete emplacements, which werehardly affected by field-guns and smaller howitzers.Sir Glyn West (Ministry of Munitions) admitted that, overand above the diversion to the arming of merchant-ships, there&apos;had been delay in manufacture, but stated that the output of long-range guns was increasing. The difficulty had arisenthrough lack of forgings for the guns ; there was no difficulty inturning out the mountings ; . the delay being confined to theactual guns. He gave the following figures of prospectivedeliveries : -                    ! Iii September.		In October.	In November.9-2-inch long-range howitzers 8-inch long-range howitzers 9&apos;2-inch guns .. 6-inch guns, Mark VII 6-inch guns, Mark PIX ...	12 11 9 8 9	14 16 5 12 12	14 18 4 16 12A factory at Nottingham had been allotted to the inanu-facture of this type of gun, but the first output from this factorycould not be expected until March of next year. He estimated thetime required for the manufacture of railway carriages for naval12-inch and 13.5-inch guns, if available, at approximately fourt five months, given best priority.In the absence of representatives of the Admiralty (who werenot present owing to the question having arisen unexpectedly),the War Cabinet were unable to pursue the question further.It was decided that a Committee, composed as follows :General Smuts (in the Chair),Mr. Churchill,A representative of the War Office,A representative of the Admiralty,Colonel E. D. Swinton (Secretary),should investigate whether any heavy guns and ammu-nition which the Admiralty could release could be adapted for military use, and report the result of theirenquiries to the War Cabinet.The Eastern Front. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that hehad heard that objections were being raised against the destruc-tion of cereals and food supplies in Moldavia (Sir G. Parclay&apos;telegram No. 450.) Similar objections, he pointed out, had been raised against the destruction of the oil wells a year ago. He had accordingly telegraphed to General Ballard, urging the greatimportance of preventing any railway material, or any supplies offood, fuel, or lubricants from falling into the enemy&apos;s hands, and urging him to take a firm attitude in support of such a policy.
5. With reference to War Cabinet 188, Minute 10, the WarCabinet had before them communications from the Admiralty(Paper G.T.-1652) and the Chief of the Imperial General staff(Paper G.T.-1458) in regard to the Channel Tunnel. BothDepartments adhered to their previous wiew that no decision could be taken on this question during the war.The War Cabinet also had before them a parliamentary question, with a draft reply, and a letter to the Prime minister from Mr. A. Fell, M.P., the Chairman of the Channel TunnelCommittee of the House of Commons (Paper G.T.-1702).The War Cabinet re-affirmed their decision of the 1stFebruary, 1917 (War Cabinet 51, Minute 11), viz. That the re-consideration of this question should be post-poned until after the conclusion of peace.They also decided that&apos; Any Parliamentary  questions on  the subject  should  boanswered in this sense.Ihe ChannelTunnel.Liquor Restriction 6. With reference to War Cabinet 176, Minute 19, the Warand Control: Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bv Lord Rhondda on wheat Reserves. Brewing and the Resumption of Malting (Paper G.T.-1645); aNote by the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies (paper g.T.-1708), and a Memorandum by Lord D&apos;Abernon (paper g.T.-1654).It was urged, on behalf of the Ministry of Food, that therehad been great difficulty in building up the stock of wheat whichthe War Cabinet had decided to be necessary in the interests ofnational safety. There was at present a reserve of 14 weeks, but during the next two months the margin would be seriouslyreduced because of the lack of crop in America. We haveexhausted the old crop, and the new crop will not begin to come here till October. On the 1st October there should be, apart fromthe home crop, a reserve of about 11 weeks&apos; supply. The price offoreign wheat is going to be high, and some 170,000,000 dollarswill be wanted almost immediately to finance the Canadian cropalone; in addition, a considerable sum would be wanted for theUnited States crop.If the 1st September were taken, it was estimated that weshould have a reserve of 1B\ weeks&apos; supply of all cereals available as breadstuffs.Accommodation for 4. The Secretary read a letter he had received from the FirstAdmiralty War       Lord of the Admiralty (Appendix I) in regard to  the serious&quot; situation created by the inability of the Admiralty to obtain the accommodation allotted to them by the award of Mr. PercyIllingworth on the 24th May.It was pointed out that this award was contingent on movingthe National Service Department from St. Ermin&apos;s Hotel, andthat now the National Service Department was to be re-organised under General A. C. Geddes, the new Director-Generalof National Service, it was impracticable to take any such stepwithout previous consultation with the latter.The War Cabinet-decided that The First Lord of the Admiralty should confer with theDirector-General of National Service with a view toarranging matters.
The home crop of wheat available for bread was estimated at,600,000 quarters, which was roughly equal to &apos;10 weeks&apos;consumption.Taking barley, and assuming 50 per cent, to be available forbreadstuffs, the crop would provide the equivalent of 5 weeks&apos;consumption of wheat. There had been a considerable increasein the land put down to oats in the United Kingdom, amounting,perhaps, to three-quarters of a million acres. If 50 per cent, ofthis crop were made available for breadstuffs it would be equal to weeks&apos; supply.There would thus be, in the case of a very serious food situa-tion arising, a supply of breadstuffs for 36 weeks. But therewould be found, in fact, considerable difficulties in realising so large a reserve, on account of the scarcity of suitable machinery in this country for the conversion of some of the cereals into palat-able food. The existing mills, for example, were not equal to alarge output of oatmeal. On the other hand, there was no doubtthat if oatmeal could be supplied at a reasonable price, theconsumption of oatcake could be much increased.In reply to a suggestion that, inasmuch as there promised tobe a large surplus of potatoes, some of it could be converted intopotato flour, it was pointed out that a million tons of potatoeswould only yield 150,000 tons of flour, enough for less than a fort-night of our requirements. Further, there is not much machineryavailable for the production of potato flour.The War Cabinet considered the suggestions put forward byLord Rhondda for the resumption of malting, in the light of theabove considerations, and of the views expressed by Mr. Prothero,Mr. Munro, Mr. Duke, and Lord D&apos;Abernon, that it would be inadvisable to reduce the supply of beer at present to thelabouring classes.The War Cabinet decided (a.) In the meantime, to continue brewing at the rate of10,700,000 standard barrels per annum to the 30thJune, 1918, and give an additional 33^ per cent, inthe summer quarter alone, as in this year making,with military requirements^ a total of 12,500,000standard barrels.-(&amp;.) To ask the Ministry of Food to report fully on thepossibility of resorting to cereals other than wheat incase of extreme urgency.(c.) To ask the Ministry of Food to arrange for an activepropaganda on the value of oatmeal and oatcakes.Lt^rtShf 7- With r^erence to War Cabinet 194, Minute 3, the AVarWar.   &apos; Cabinet were given to understand that, after considering all theavailable information, Dr. Addison concurred in the proposal ofthe Ministry of Labour to set up a Central Demobilisation Com-mittee for the Redistribution of Labour after the War (paper g.T.-56).The War Cabinet approved the scheme  set  forth by  theMinistry of Labour.Importation ofCurrants from greece :The Taranto Route.8. The attention of Mr. Wintour, the Secretary of theMinistry of Food, was drawn to the possibilities offered by thedevelopment of the Taranto route for the importation of currantsfrom Greece. It was pointed out that 300 tons a day of military stores are actually being carried to Taranto by this route, and
British imports into France, andFrench imports into Great Britain.ForeignCommercialIntelligence.9. Lord Robert Cecil stated that he had reached anagreement with the President of the Board of Trade that it wouldbe advisable to inform M. Clementel, who was now in England onbehalf of the French Government, that the British Government nolonger adhered to certain restrictions on the import of Frencharticles, such as hats, ribbons, silk, and fruit. He intimated thatthe French considered the present exclusion was a form of Protec-tion.   No objection could be raised to the import of these articleson the ground of tonnage,as many ships taking material toThe exchange also was against the france came back empFrench.The Shipping Controller concurred in Lord Robert Cecihsview that no objection could be raised on the ground of tonnage,and stated that if the goods were ready for shipment at French ports there would be no serious delay or difficulty in shippingthem.Sir Albert Stanley strongly supported the proposed reiaxa-tion of restrictions, and attached great importance to his being ina position to make a reply on the following day to M. Clementel.The War Cabinet decided To waive the restrictions, and left the form and precisedetails in which this 0was to be communicated toM. Clenientel to Lord Robert Cecil and Sir albert stanley.10. The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandumby Sir Albert Stanley and Lord Robert Cecil, dated the 14thAugust, 1917 (Paper G.T.-1707) (Appendix II), regarding thefuture collection and diffusion of commercial intelligence at homeand in foreign countries.Lord Robert Cecil pointed cut that the Memorandumembodied the results of a series of conferences between the Boardof Trade and the Foreign Office regarding the Consular Serviceand the recommendations of Lord Faringdon&apos;s Committee,and that Sir Albert Stanley and he had had the benefit of theassistance of Mr. Montagu as unofficial mediator between theForeign Office and the Board of Trade. He urged that thewar had proved that it was not possible to separate political fromtrade matters in the Diplomatic and Consular Services, and thatthe proposed scheme of amalgamation under one parliamentary secretary, acting both for the Foreign Office and the Board ofTrade, was the only practical scheme which was possible.Sir Albert Stanley concurred in this view, and the WarCabinet decided that The recommendations contained in the joint Memorandumabove referred to should be adopted.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 16, 1917.[1365-216]Cthat there was no homeward freight for the ships returning from Salonica and Greece to Taranto.The Secretary stated that he had ascertained from the Ship-ping Controller that the utilisation of this route for currants wasfeasible, and, from the Director-General of Movements and railways, that the Trans-Continental route could be utilised forthe same purpose.The Secretary of the Ministry of Food stated that theMinistry of Food had already opened negotiations for the pur-chase of the Greek currant crop, and he undertook to look intothe possibilities of utilising the Taranto route.
APPENDIX I.Sir Maurice Hankey,I. AM loth to have to trouble the Prime Minister and the War Cabinet withaccommodation questions, but the position at the Admiralty is so serious that I amleft with no alternative.The Prime Minister will remember that Mr. Ulingworth, who had beenappointed by him to arbitrate on the question of the provision of accommodation forthe newly-established Department of the Controller at the Admiralty, issued hisaward so long ago as the 24th May of this year. Nearly three months have passed,and only very partial effect has yet been given to the arbitrator^ decision, whichwas conveyed to the Departments concerned as a definite instruction from the PrimeMinister.The award included the vacation by the Trench Warfare Department of therooms at present occupied by them in the new Government buildings in Great george street. The Trench Warfare Department still remains in possession, with theresult that the Controllers organisation at the Admiralty cannot get to work; and itis quite impossible for the Admiralty War Staff to be remodelled and extended inthe direction required by the War Cabinet. The War Cabinet will I am sure not expect any progress to be made with the re-organisation of the Admiralty whether on its naval or its civil side until the elementary needs of accommodation have been met; and it is not too much to say that the delay in giving effect to Mr. Illingworth&apos;saward is very seriously hampering the naval conduct of the war, and the adoption of measures to meet the submarine tactics of the enemy.It is, I understand, by instructions of the Prime Minister that Mr. Illingworth&apos;saward is not being acted upon; and I would be doing less than my duty if I did not represent the extremely serious effect upon the work of the War Staff caused thereby.E. C. G.August 14, 1917.c APPENDIX II.G.T.-1707. --Foreign Commercial Intelligence.Joint Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and Lord Robert Cecil.IT is clear that after the war the demands upon the Government for the collection and diffusion of commercial intelligence for the benefit of British trade are likely tobe very much greater than in the past. Both the Board of Trade and the ForeignOffice have for some time past been.maturing plans for developing and improving theofficial arrangements for commercial intelligence so far as they fall within their scope.The Board of Trade have obtained the sanction of the Treasury for a large developmentof their Department of Commercial Intelligence and for a wide expansion of the systemof Trade Commissioners within the Empire, which was originally established by thepresent Prime Minister when President of the Board of Trade. On the other hand, theForeign Office has carefully examined by means of a Departmental Committee the best means of increasing the utility, of the commercial attache and consular service toBritish trade, and has drawn up a scheme for the purpose.Some difficulties, however, arose in defining and adjusting the limits of responsi-bility of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade with respect to the collection anddistribution of commercial intelligence obtained through the medium of the commercialattaches and consuls in foreign countries. Eventually, Viscount Grey and Mr. Runcimanagreed last autumn on a compromise for dealing with the subject, which is appended to this memorandum (see Annex I, p. 1). Subsequently, at the request of theForeign Office it was decided to. appoint a Committee, under the chairmanship ofLord Faringdon, with power to review the whole question. This Committee, however,failed to come to an unanimous agreement, and presented two reports, which areannexed to this memorandum (see Annex I).
The War Cabinet will observe that there were in effect two main questionssubmitted to the Faringdon Committee. The first was whether the Foreign Office orthe Board of Trade should control the commercial intelligence service abroad, which is supplied by the commercial attaches. Upon the first point all the members of theCommittee were in substantial agreement that the control of commercial attachesshould be left to the Foreign Office, acting in close consultation with the Board of.Trade as regards instructions and appointments, and that both this service and the consular service should be enlarged and improved. A Committee on which the Boardof Trade are represented has been appointed by the Foreign Office to consider what changes in the present system are necessary to carry out the views of the Committee.This Committee has had several meetings and has made considerable progress. If theTreasury approve of the arrangements recommended, a second Committee will immediately proceed to select the personnel necessary.The second question was whether the work of collating and distributingcommercial intelligence from foreign countries among the commercial community inthis country should continue to be performed by the Department of commercial intelligence of the Board of Trade or should be dealt with by a Department to be created at the Foreign Office. Upon the second point the Committee were not inagreement. The chairman and the representative of the Board of Trade decided infavour of the former course. The majority of the Committee favoured the work being done by the Foreign Office.Subsequent discussions have taken place with a view of arriving at an agreementbetween the Departments, with the assistance of Mr. Montagu (then Vice-Chairman ofthe Reconstruction Committee).The following scheme has now been agreed upon by the President of the Boardof Trade and by Lord Robert Cecil representing the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, and is submitted for the approval of the War Cabinet.It is proposed that a new and enlarged Commercial Intelligence Department shallbe created on a scale adequate to meet the reasonable requirements of British tradeafter the war. Parliamentary control over the Department will be exercised through anew Parliamentary Secretary, who will occujDy the position both of AdditionalParliamentary Secretary at the Board of Trade and also of Additional parliamentary under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. This Parliamentary Secretary will be responsible to the President of the Board of Trade for all matters within the competence of that department, and responsible to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for all matters concerning the Foreign Office. An agreement has been arrived at as to thematters which, under this arrangement, will be referable to the Foreign Secretary (see annex II).   On all other matters the responsibility will lie with the Board of Trade.The Commercial Intelligence Department will eventually comprise the existingDepartment of Commercial Intelligence of the Board of Trade, and the Foreign trade department of the Foreign Office; and will take over such of the staff and records ofthe War Trade Intelligence and Statistical Departments as may be available andrequired.The official head of the Department will be an officer appointed jointly by thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Theappointment and control of the Trade Commissioners will, as at present, rest withthe Board of Trade, and the appointment and control of the commercial attaches and consular service with the Foreign Office, but the work of the new Department will comprise all matters dealing with commercial intelligence, and, so far as is necessaryfor that purpose, it will give directions to the overseas services, and make thenecessary arrangements for keeping them in close touch with the commercial classes inthis country. All official instructions given by the Department to commercial attachesor consuls will be issued in the name of the Foreign Secretary.It is proposed that there should be a constant interchange of staff between theDepartment and both the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, so that members ofthose Departments may be thoroughly acquainted with the work. Opportunity shouldbe given to diplomats and consuls in training to serve for a period in the Department.It should also draw personnel from the consular and commercial attaches services, andfrom men of outside business experience.It is submitted that these proposals go far towards solving a problem, which, forsome years past, has been urged on the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government by thecommercial and industrial conimunity. Their criticisms have been especially directed against the duality of the existing systems, under which, while the direction of thecommercial attache and consular services rests with the Foreign Office, the utilisation
of the fruits of their commercial work lies with the Board of Trade. Under the new scheme, the direction of the commercial work of the foreign services and thedistribution of the intelligence collected by them will be dealt with by a single department, and, as the same Department will also direct the Trade Commissionerservice within the Empire, uniformity of policy will be secured in respect of overseatrade as a whole. *The constitution of the proposed Department presents, no doubt, an unusualfeature in that the new Parliamentary Secretary &quot;will be responsible to the President ofthe Board of Trade for one group of questions, and to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs for another. Some such duality, however, is essential if overlappingand duplication are to be avoided, and, since a clear demarcation of his responsibilitieshas already been agreed upon, it is not thought that there need be any difficulty in practical working.An Act of the Legislature will be necessary to create the new ParliamentarySecretaryship. Although this cannot be introduced at the moment, it is proposed, ifthe plan is approved by the War Cabinet, to proceed at once with the necessary administrative arrangements.The sanction of the War Cabinet is invited to these proposals.A.

CONFIDENTIAL.ANNEX I.COMMITTEE ON  COMMERCIAL  INTELLIGENCE   IN  FOREIGNCOUNTRIES.Minute of Appointment.THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board ofTrade are pleased to appoint the following gentlemen, namely : The Lord Faringdon (Chairman);Sir W. H. Clark, K.C.S.I., C.M.G. ;Mr. F. Dudley Docker, C.B.;Mr. de F. Pennefather, M.P. ; andMr. V. A. Wellesley,to be a Committee to enophre into the best form of organisation for promoting our foreign trade through representatives abroad, including the consular service, and, inparticular, to consider whether the agreement between the late Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the late President of the Board of Trade, dated the 3rd October,1916, requires any and what amendment or alteration.They are further pleased to appoint Mr. G. C. Upcott to be Secretary to theCommittee.ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR.A. H. STANLEY.January 24, 1917.Agreement for a Trade Commissioner Service in Foreign Countries arrivedat by Lord Grey and Mr. Runciman.After an exchange of views between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe President of the Board of Trade, it was decided by them that: 1. Commercial attaches at His Majesty&apos;s Embassies and Legations should bereplaced by trade commissioners who, in the first instance, should be appointed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade inconsultation, the method of future appointment being left to the decision of a committeeto be appointed to discuss this and other kindred questions.2. The trade commissioner should form part of the diplomatic staff of His Majesty&apos;s embassy or Legation, and be directly subordinate to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Minister, or Charge d&apos;Affaires.3. The trade commissioner should receive his instructions from the Board of Tradethrough the Foreign Office and head of the diplomatic mission, under flying seal, andshould send his reports addressed to the President of the Board of Trade through thesame channel and in the same manner.4. The trade commissioner should be empowered to give instructions, approved bythe head of the mission, to consular officers on commercial matters.5. The head of a diplomatic mission should be empowered to suspend instructions issued by the Board of Trade to a trade commissioner when for political or other reasons he may consider such a course desirable, in which case, if of sufficient importance,he would give his reasons to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.6. Officers of experience of the diplomatic and consular services should not be debarred from appointment to the posts of trade commissioner.7. Trade commissioners should encourage as much as possible the training andutilisation of the services of junior members of the diplomatic service in commercial matters in the countries in which they are employed.October 3, 1916.[477],B
Keport by Mr. F. Dudley Docker, C.B., Mr. de 2?. Pennefather, M.P.,and Mr. Victor Wellesley.To the Eight Honourable the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the right honourable the President of the Board of Trade.Gentlemen,1. Our &quot; terms of reference &quot; require us in the first place to consider &quot; the best formof organisation for promoting our foreign trade through representatives abroad,including the consular service.&quot; In our opinion, any efficient organisation abroad forthe promotion of trade must necessarily be based on an efficient consular service. Thereports which have recently been published on this service include the Report of theRoyal Commission of 1912-14 (compiled before the war), the two Reports of the associated Chambers of Commerce, dated December 1916 and January 1917, and theReport of the Federation of British Industries, issued last December. As they containmany of the reasons which have convinced us that the consular service requiresconsiderable extension and reform we do not consider it necessary to burden this report with much recapitulation, or with detailed suggestions as to the manner in which reformsand reorganisation should be carried out. We believe that the details of effectiveadministrative reform can only be instituted and carried through by those immediatelyresponsible for the service, after careful and thorough investigation of new circumstancesresulting from the war as affecting the different countries in which the consular serviceperforms its duties.2. We desire to state, however, that we consider that most of the recommendations contained in the report of the Departmental Committee of the Foreign Office (which isattached as an appendix to this report) appear to us to be based upon correctprinciples, although details may require amendment and some more careful definitionsmay be desirable. We desire to emphasise most strongly our opinion that theconsideration of these proposals with a view to their adoption should be undertaken without delay by a small Foreign Office Committee upon which the Board of trade should be represented, and that reforms approved by this committee should be carried into effect promptly under its supervision. We feel it necessary to add that the reforms should in any case include a considerable addition to the number of existingconsular posts, together with their careful redistribution in accordance with commercialadvice, a large increase in the number of salaried officers, a reduction in the number ofunpaid (i.e., trading) officers, and the elimination to the greatest possible extentof consular officers in any capacity who are not of British birth and descent. We alsorecommend to the attention of the committee, which we have suggested above, thedesirability of revising the scale of pay, and especially the scale of office and other localallowances at present allotted to the consular service, together with the question of more rapid promotion, retirement of those who are no longer efficient, the provision of betterconsular premises, and an increase in the clerical staff at many consulates.8. At the same time we desire to record our opinion that the consular service atpresent contains many officers of great zeal and ability, and that the shortcomings ofthis service in the past may have been largely due, in many cases, to the employmentof unsuitable honorary officers, to lack of staff, to failure to provide the facilities andfunds required to enable consuls to perform their duties efficiently, and to lackof proper direction from this country rather than to the faults of the officialsthemselves.4. Assuming an improved consular service to have been organised, we consider itshould be supplemented by the creation of a new class of officers consisting of men(in sufficient numbers) who would be neither consuls nor trade commissioners, norcommercial attaches (as those terms are at present generally understood), but who should, in fact, be &quot; commercial intelligence officers,&quot; although preferably called&quot;commercial counsellors.&quot; These commercial counsellors should receive diplomaticrank (as the present commercial attaches do), and connect up the consulates (withwhich they should work closely) the commercial side of the embassies to whichthey are attached, and the commercial side of the Foreign Office in London.5. While the heads of missions abroad would naturally turn to these commercialcounsellors for information and advice, precautions should be taken to preventcommercial counsellors from becoming absorbed in the ordinary routine work of the embassy. One of these precautions should be the provision of staffs for the commercialcounsellors, each of whom should have at least one competent permanent assistant,capable of taking his place and doing his work during his absence, and, wherever
possible, of separate offices. In addition to this, junior members of the embassy shouldbe obliged to give definite assistance for a definite period in the office of the commercial counsellor as a necessary step towards promotion.6. We think that the main functions of a commercial counsellor should be to watch over British financial, commercial, and industrial interests in the country orarea of a country in which he is stationed, and to collect and transmit promptly tothe Foreign Office all information likely to be serviceable to such interests. He shouldtravel in his district, in order to visit and confer with the consular officials therein(who in any case should, on their own initiative, report regularly to him on commercial matters&apos; in addition to replying to his enquiries) and to increase his knowledgegenerally. He should co-operate and consult with any bodies or persons approved bythe head of his mission (for example, the local branches or agenis of the proposedBritish trade banks), and be able to obtain freely the assistance of &quot; experts &quot; in regardto matters which require special or technical knowledge. We do not think that com-mercial counsellors should be &quot; glorified commercial travellers,&quot; pushing the interestsof particular persons or groups of traders, but rather that they should investigateconditions, analyse their causes, observe recent changes and indications of impendingchanges, study the nature, extent, and fluctuations of competitive trades, watch foropenings for British trade, and report and advise upon all these matters in thenational interest. They should, from time to time, return to this country in orderto report to the Foreign Office, and to be brought by it into touch with the commercialcommunity through the Chambers of Commerce or otherwise.7. It is obvious that anyone possessing the knowledge, tact, initiative, and character essential to the proper discharge of the duties of a commercial counsellor,must be entitled to good position and rumunei-ation, and it is to be hoped that theprospect of promotion to these well-paid and honourable posts of commercial counsellorsand assistant commercial counsellors wall add to the inducements of the consular service as a career, and stimulate the interest of consuls in the commercial side of their work.With this object in view, wre suggest as a general rule that in making theseappointments preference should be given to consular officers (irrespective of seniority)who have proved themselves to possess special aptitude in regard to commercial matters, and who are generally suitable for the posts. At the same time, if men more suitable can be found outside the consular service, such men should not be debarred from being selected as commercial counsellors or their assistants. There are no doubtmen of commercial experience who after a short preparation would be more suitablefor such posts than others who have only had diplomatic, consular, or departmentalexperience. So much wdll depend upon the selection of the right men for theseposts particidarly at first that we think they should be appointed by the Secretaryof State, after consultation with a selection committee consisting of representativesof the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade, and the commercial community, and later,if the service developed into an Imperial service, including representatives of theDominions, India, and the Crown colonies. We also recommend that a representativeof the commercial community should be represented on the Board of Selection forcandidates for the consular service.8. Assuming that this new class of commercial counsellors has been created, thequestion arises under whose control and direction should the commercial counseUorsand their assistants be placed ?   There are apparently three alternatives : (1.) More or less dual control or direction divided between the Foreign Office andthe Board of Trade.(2.) Sole control and direction by the Board of Trade.(3.) Sole control and direction by the Foreign Office.After very careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that the adoptionof No. 1 in any form would merely mean a compromise between the two Departments,leaving untouched the great and obvious objections to placing our agents in foreigncountries only partly under the direction of the Department which is responsible fortheir actions, and partly, perhaps mainly, under the direction of another Departmentwhich has no such responsibility, and which cannot either reward them for goodservice or punish them for inefficiency ; we therefore decide against alternative No. 1.If it were practicable to hand over the sole control and direction of our consulsand commercial counsellors to the Board of Trade, much might be said from some points of view in favour of that course, but, as it is admittedly not practicable, we are obliged also to reject alternative No. 2.
This elimination forces us to the adoption of No. 3. Apart from this, we considerthat, as the commercial counsellors form an essential link between the consular and the diplomatic services, and as both of these services are (and admittedly must remain)under the Foreigh Office, it is clear that the proper Department to control and direct the commercial counsellors and their assistants must also be the Foreign Office.9. We are strengthened in this view by the fact that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs is the only Minister who can be held responsible in Parliament for  the actions or errors of our representatives or agents in foreign countries, and for any con-sequences arising therefrom. It would be impossible for the Foreign Office to exerciseproper control, or for the Secretary of State to be held fully responsible to the countrythrough Parliament, if the commercial counsellors were to receive instructions from, or beinterfered with by, any other bodjr. Divided direction or control would also infringethe elementary rules of sound organisation, and ultimately lead to inter-departmentalfriction, duplication of work, delay, loss of efficiency, and needless expenditure.Moreover, we do not see any necessity for such division of control or direction,since it should be the obvious duty of the Foreign Office not merely to obtain and supply the Board of Trade with all the foreign commercial information required by it,but also to direct the attention of the Board of Trade to all foreign matters of com-mercial importance, even although the Board of Trade had not enquired about them,just as it should be the duty of the Board of Trade to draw the attention of theForeign Office to all matters arising in this country which ought to be known to it orcommunicated to our representatives abroad. All statistics compiled by eitherDepartment should of course be promptly supplied to the other.10. The question remains : How is the information collected by the commercialcounsellors abroad to be distributed at home and by whom ? Under the presentsystem, most of such work is done by the Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Boardof Trade. We think that in future all this work should be done by a Trade IntelligenceDepartment at the Foreign Office, and that for this purpose the principle should beaccepted of transferring to this Department as much of the existing staff of the Com-mercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade as may be practicable, thusintroducing into the Foreign Office elements of business knowledge and details withwhich it is very desirable that it should be brought into the closest possible contactin order that our foreign commercial interests should be intelligently dealt with.11. We attach the greatest importance to the commercial counsellors and theDepartment responsible for them being thus brought in close and constant touch with industrial, commercial, and financial interests at home, in order chat they may acquirefull knowledge and feel the full and direct force of the views of these interests, insteadof obtaining them (possibly in a devitalised form) at second hand.In this connection we quote the following passage from the just-issued final report of the Dominions Royal Commission (Cd. 8462, paragraph 638, p. 142): &quot; It appears to us that any organisation for the purpose of fostering the trade or commerce of a country cannot, and should not, deal solely with economic oppor-tunities abroad. Enquiries in oversea markets can only be properly directed andthe results adequately utilised in the light of a full knowledge of industrial require-ments and industrial capabilities at home. The ideal Commercial IntelligenceDepartment of any Government must therefore depend for efficient, working asmuch on a staff of experts conversant with home industries as upon well-trainedcommercial representatives abroad. We fear that, in the organisation of commer-cial services in the past, this consideration has sometimes been overlooked ; but weemphasise it, as it is obvious that after the war there will be a keen competitionamongst manufacturing countries to secure overseas trade for their industries.&quot;We concur so completely with the above that we urge that in future the Depart-ment which ha)s control of our consuls and commercial counsellors [i.e., of our foreigncommercial intelligence&apos; agents), and which (for reasons already given) should directthem, ought also to be made fully conversant with the requirements and capabilities ofour manufacturers through constant and direct touch with them. We see no reason why any desired number of &quot;experts&quot; should not be added to the existing CommercialDepartment at the Foreign Office, as this commercial intelligence staff need not be recruited on the same lines as the purely diplomatic staff, but can be created ad hoc as required.The fact that various Government Departments, including the Board of Trade,have successfully brought in from outside heads and staff without any- previous
5198departmental training, proves that it is quite possible at short notice to introducebusiness experience and acumen into a Government Department.12. We think that other advantages in having the proposed new commercial intelligence Department at the Foreign Office would be that the information collectedabroad could be issued from that Department with the least possible delay and withthe greatest discretion, and that from such a Department enquiries and suggestionsemanating from traders at home could be sent abroad with the greatest despatch.13. Our suggestions are not intended to cast any slur upon, or in any way to affectprejudicially the status of, any member of the Commercial Intelligence Branch of theBoard of Trade as at present constituted, or of any member of the existing foreign trade Department of the Foreign Office, which has, we believe, done much valuablecommercial work since its institution in January 1916. We do not suggest any changein regard to the present connection between the Board of Trade (or other Departments)and our consuls abroad in regard to shipping and other, matters which do not affectand are not affected by our foreign commercial policy.14. Nor do we suggest any transfer of that part of the Board of Trade commercial intelligence Branch which relates to trade with our Dominions, Crown colonies, orO ... ....India. Our reference being limited to &quot; foreign &quot; countries, we do not feel justified mmaking suggestions in regard to such points which obviously would require separate consideration by the Colonial and India Offices or representatives of the Dominions andCrown Colonies, and which might open up larger questions, such as that of a Ministryof Commerce, which, of course, is a matter quite apart from our present enquiry.15. We realise that our proposals involve for the present, at all events themaintenance of two Trade Intelligence Departments, one under the Foreign Office inconnection with foreign countries, and another under the Board of Trade in connectionwith the Dominions and Crown Colonies. While this might in some respects beinconvenient, we consider that any such inconvenience would be mainly a matter of detail capable of adjustment. We are, in fact, informed that there would be nodifficulty in arranging to house these two Intelligence Departments under one roof.In any case, even if some slight inconvenience were permanent, it would, we feel sure,be much more than counterbalanced by the advantages of the changes we propose.1G. It would, of course, be difficult, if not impossible, to force upon an unwillingForeign Office the new duties and responsibilities wdiich are suggested, but, as will beseen from the annexed report, the Foreign Office, so far from objecting, have expressed a desire to undertake them and to carry out the reforms necessary, in order to makethe proposed new departures a success. We think no obstacle should be placed in theway of the development within the Foreign Office of this commendable spirit of greaterinterest in commercial affairs.17. That the Board of Trade should hesitate about parting with a portion of theCommercial Intelligence Branch which it has built up is only natural, but we are more concerned with what we deem to be national interests than with departmentalinterests. For this reason we desire to state that we regard it as being of the greatest importance that members of the diplomatic service and of the Foreign Office should be assisted to realise that a knowledge of commercial matters is essential to their fitness to perform their duties, and to recommend that a certain minimum period of employmentupon the commercial side be made a necessary qualification for promotion in each gradeof the service, and that ample opportunities should be given to these officers to acquire a knowledge of commercial work through exchange of duties with the officers of the intelligence Department and by other means.18. Having now dealt with the organisation of commercial intelligence, we proceedto consider the commercial policy which that organisation is intended to assist. Wethink it is impossible to sever questions of commercial policy in foreign countries from general foreign policy, of which they are an integral part. International relations in general depend, and must tend to depend more and more in future, upon commercial relations, and it is inevitable that foreign policy will consequently be affected to an everincreasing extent by commercial and industrial circumstances. We believe that anyattempt to retard this development in the interests of mere administrative conveniencewill react fatally upon the general interests of the country, and that a favourabledevelopment can only take place if those in charge of foreign affairs are kept in close and constant touch with commercial requirements.On the other hand, it is of equal importance that the general commercial andindustrial policy of the country shall be kept in the closest possible co-ordination withthe foreign commercial policy, and above all that any measures taken to develop and improve industrial and other commercial activities at home or within the Empire shall[477]    . C
be taken with a full knowledge of facts relating to foreign trade. We believe that eventhe best organised intelligence service will be to a great extent useless unless in the sphere of policy the closest possible touch is kept between the Board of Trade andthe Foreign Office, and that, while in order to secure the necessary directness of control,a sharp line of demarcation should be drawn between activities abroad (such as foreigncommercial intelligence), which properly pertain to the sphere of the Foreign Office,and the regulation of industrial and other matters at home, which properly belong tothe Board of Trade, this line of demarcation should not exist as regards matters ofpolicy.19. In order to avoid any danger of conflicting advice being tendered to HisMajesty&apos;s Government by the Board of Trade on the one hand, and the Foreign office on the other, we recommend the setting up of a joint committee to deal with all mattersof commercial policy. This committee, to keep Up to- date, should sit regularly at frequent intervals to consider, and, if necessary, to make recommendations to HisMajesty&apos;s Government on all matters and measures relating to commercial treaties and policy (as distinct from the detailed administration of the duties respectively allotted to the Foreign Office and to the Board of Trade). This joint committee should, in ouropinion, consist of a preponderance of representatives from the different departments of the Board of Trade, together with representatives of the Foreign Office, and severalrepresentative business men chosen from a panel selected by the most importantcommercial and industrial bodies of the country. This would render it unnecessaryfor the Foreign Office to have any separate &quot; advisory committee,&quot; and might possiblyrender a separate advisory committee of the Board of Trade superfluous.In any case, this joint committee would focus the knowledge and experience ofthe two Departments and of our business men at the point where it would be mostserviceable in the general interests of the country. Possibly this joint committee might afterwards be further strengthened by the addition of representatives of the india and Colonial Offices.20. Having thus disposed of the first part of our reference we come to the second part, which instructs us to &quot; consider whether the agreement between the Secretary ofState for , Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade, dated the 3rdOctober, 1916, requires any and what amendment or alteration.&quot;In view of all we have submitted above, we think it is unnecessary to discuss thisagreement in detail, as it must be evident that, we consider that it should cease to be operative, and that an entirely different set of conditions should become applicable.We have the honour to be, Gentlemen,Your obedient Servants,(Signed) F. DUDLEY DOCKER.* De F. PENNEFATHER.VICTOR WELLESLEY.G. C. Upcott, Secretary.April 4, 1917.Report by the Chairman and Sir W. H. Clark, K.C.S.I., C.M.G.To the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the right honourable the President of the Board of Trade.Gentlemen, \1. The terms of our reference direct us to enquire into the best form of organisation for promoting our foreign trade through representatives abroad, includingthe consular service, and in particular to consider whether the agreement between theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade, datedthe 3rd October, 1916, recpiires airy and what amendment or.alteration.&quot; In view of the wide interpretation which might be given to these terms, we felt it necessary at the outset of our deliberations to consider carefully what should be the scope of our enquiry. Theorganisation of the consular service, which must always be the foundation of any system of commercial intelligence abroad, has been frequently investigated in recentyears, notably by the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (Fifth Report, Cd. 7748 of
1914), and we have not felt it expedient to go in detail over the ground already covered by these and former enquiries. We have endeavoured rather to set forthwhat, in our view, should be the broad lines on which our commercial intelligencemachinery should be organised, and have not attempted to deal with details of an administrative order or to frame estimates of the expenditure which will be required,if the principles which we recommend are adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. The scope of our enquiry having been thus defined, we have not found itnecessary to take a large amount of evidence. We have, however, had before uscertain alternative: official schemes for the improvement of our commercial intelligence service in foreign countries, namely : (l.) The proposals originally put forward by the Board of Trade, to which we refer in paragraph 4 below;(2.) A scheme prepared by a Departmental Committee of the Foreign Office in1916, which we attach; and(3.) The scheme contained in the agreement between the late Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the late President of the Board of Trade which,we understand, was arrived at as a result of their joint consideration ofschemes (1) and (2).We have also considered the reports issued by the Association of Chambers ofCommerce of the United Kingdom in December 1916 and January 1917, and therecommendations recently published by the Federation of British Industries, and wehave lately had an opportunity of reading chapter 12 of the Final Report of theDominions Royal Commission (Cd. 8462 of 1917), which deals wuth certain aspects ofthe matter.3. The questions at issue may be readily comprehended by comparison betweenthe above-mentioned agreement and the proposals contained in the report of theForeign Office Committee and they fail conveniently under the two following headings, viz. : (1.) The position and duties of the commercial attache or trade commissionerabroad;(2.) The organisation in this country of the system of collecting enquiries fromthe commercial community, of framing instructions for the guidance of the agents abroad and disseminating the information contained from thoseagents.We think that the principles involved will be found to be clearly defined in-our report, and, having regard to the desirability of extending our export trade after thewar, we would emphasise the importance of a speedy decision upon these questions, inorder that the new arrangements may be brought into effective operation before the endof the war.4. We understand that it was originally proposed by the Board of Trade that trade commissioners for service in foreign countries should be appointed by that department on the advice of a selection committee on which the Foreign Office wouldbe represented, but in the agreement referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, it wasdecided that commercial attaches at His Majesty&apos;s Embassies and Legations should bereplaced by trade commissioners who, in the first instance, should be appointed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade inconsultation, the method of future appointment being left for further consideration.The commissioner would, under this agreement, be part of the diplomatic staff, and be directly subordinate to the head of the mission, but, subject to these and certain other conditions, he would be in effect an officer of, and responsible to, the Board of Trade.The system would be, as it is in fact intended to be, the counterpart of the service oftrade commissioners which has been established in recent years by the Board of Tradein the self-governing Dominions.5. The evidence brought before us points to the necessity for a more vigorous andsystematic collection of commercial intelligence, and we agree, therefore, that for thispurpose the consular service - should be supplemented by an organised service ofpermanent officers who should be stationed in foreign countries, and should devote theirwdiole time to commercial matters.. But both on grounds of general principle and alsoin view of the close relation which will necessarily exist between their duties and questions of foreign policy, and of the fact that they will be in constant touch with thepublic in the foreign country in which they are stationed, we think it ess^ntK1
these officers should be appointed by, and should be under the control of, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs. We recognise, however, the important interest of theBoard of Trade in the matter, and, while we concur in the recommendation of theForeign Office Committee that the existing system of commercial attaches should be organised and extended, we recommend that these officers should in future be appointedby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs after consultation with the Board ofTrade. Systematic methods should be devised in order to secure that, both in thepreliminary consideration and in the final choice of candidates, such consultation is areality, and while the final-decision in case of difference must, of course, rest Avith theSecretary of State, the fullest opportunity of indicating their views should be given tothe Board of Trade. We suggest that a selection committee might be appointed forthe purpose, consisting of representatives of the two Departments and two or threebusiness men.6. We are of opinion that the commercial attaches should receive diplomatic rank,and should be directly subordinate to the head of the mission in the country inwhich they are stationed. They should be recruited in future mainly by promotionfrom the consular service, subject to the strict understanding that such promotion ismade, not on grounds of seniority, but in the light of proved capacity for the specialcommercial work required. At the same time it is in our judgment very important that a free hand should always be kept to select suitable officers from other sources,and in particular to appoint men of actual commercial experience from outside thepublic service. We believe that many well-qualified officers can now be found in theexisting consular service, and we hope that the prospect of advancement to the post ofcommercial attache, by emphasising the importance of the commercial work of theservice and by enhancing its attractiveness, will in course of time increase thenumber. But it must not be overlooked that the latter consideration will necessarily have a gradual effect ,only, and in view of the immediate necessity for an improved system of commercial intelligence we recommend that at the outser. andfor a certain number of years a proportion of appointments should be made from outside.   The salary should be sufficient to attract men of standing and ability.7. The duties of the commercial attache abroad should in our opinion be primarilythose of an intelligence officer, that is, to report upon trade generally in the country towhich he is accredited, to watch for and advise upon opportunities for the devolopmentof British trade, and to furnish reports, both on his own initiative and in reply to enquiries addressed to him, upon all matters of commercial interest and importance.He should have authority to instruct consular officers, when necessary, to make enquiries and supply information to him on these matters. We recommend that heshould be provided with an assistant and adequate clerical staff, and, wherever possible, with separate office accommodation, and that he should travel frequentlythroughout his district, and pay regular visits to this country with a view to meetingthe commercial community.8. It has Been represented to us on behalf of the Foreign Office that thecommercial attache should also be the chief adviser of the head of the mission in commercial matters, and that he should be charged with the duties of superintendinggenerally the commercial work of the consulates, of carrying out consular inspectionsand of making recommendations as to changes in consular establishments. We haveno doubt that heads of missions will certainly desire to obtain the advice of experienced commercial attaches on questions with regard to which they will obviously have acquired expert knowledge. On the other hand our attention hasbeen drawn to the view expressed in the report of Sir Eldon Gorst and Mr. (nowSir Hubert) Llewellyn Smith in 1906 (Cd. 3610 of 1907), that in missions which are the headquarters of a commercial attache there was a tendency to devolve on him all thecurrent commercial work. The difficulties thus arising would no doubt - be- met tosome extent if, as we propose, the commercial attache is provided with assistance, butwe attach great importance to the view that the current secretarial work of a missionrelating to commercial matters should be discharged by the ordinary diplomaticstaff, who should be impressed with the importance of giving special study to suchmatters.9. Although it may be found convenient in a certain number of cases to continuethe present arrangements under which the commercial attache is charged with the dutyof constdar inspection, we do not think that as a general rule he should be required to perform administrative duties in relation to the consular service. We are convinced bythe evidence given to us that in the Far East, for example, such arrangements wouldbe impracticable ; and while the objections may be less serious in other parts of the
world, we are strongly of opinion that the efficiency of the commercial intelligencesystem is likely to be impaired, if it is necessary in the selection of the commercialattaches to have regard to their suitability for these inspection duties. This require-ment would make it difficult to select for these posts consuls of comparatively short service, who may often be the best fitted for purely intelligence work, and still moredifficult to appoint men of commercial experience from outside the service. It would,we think, inevitably give rise to a tendency which, as we have already indicated,should in our opinion be guarded against, to limit the selection to officers of seniorityin the consular service. We think that consular inspection should be the duty of thehead of the mission, who would no doubt delegate his powers when he thought fit, andit would frequently happen that the most suitable officer for the duty would be thecommercial attache.10. We proceed to consider what should be the commercial intelligence organisation in this country. This has hitherto consisted in the commercial intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade in the City, which has recently beenreorganised as the Department of Commercial Intelligence by the amalgamation ofthat branch and the ENdhbitions Branch of the Board. The Board of Trade are alsoassisted by an advisory committee on commercial intelligence, which includes representa-tives of certain public departments and of the Dominion Governments, as well ascommercial members. The Board of Trade witness informed us that in the past the intelligence work of the Department has been hampered by insufficiency of staff both athome and abroad, and it is admitted that the absence of any recognised method ofcommunication with the commercial attaches hitherto appointed has been a seriousdefect. The question of staff will now, it is hoped, be met without difficultyr and itwas part of the original scheme put forward by the Board that instructions should beissued direct to the proposed trade commissioners in foreign countries by the Depart-ment of Commercial Intelligence, and that the commissioners should similarlv sendtheir reports to that department, heads of missions receiving copies for information-The agreement between Lord Grey and Mr. Runciman did not depart in principle fromthe proposed arrangement, but provided that, while the Department of commercial intelligence should correspond with the officers overseas, such correspondence should go through the Foreign Office under flying seal.11. Widely different proposals of a far-reaching nature have been laid before uson behalf of the Foreign Office. In the report of the Departmental Committee,mentioned in paragraph 2 above, it is proposed (paragraph 22) that a Foreign trade department should be established under the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&quot; controlling the consular service and the commercial attaches, directing the system of intelligence derived from these agents, and keeping touch with those in this country who are engaged in foreign trade, so as to make available to them without delay the intelligence so obtained.&quot; It is further proposed that this department should be assisted by an advisory committee (paragraph 29) consisting of representatives of theBoard of Trade, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and India Office, and by a large numberof panels of business men, representing each important branch of finance, industry, and commerce (paragraph 37).The position which it is suggested that the Board of Trade should occupy inrelation to the proposed Foreign Trade Department is laid down in paragraph 43 of thereport as follows :--&quot; In order to avoid any misapprehension which may arise out of the proposals made in the preceding section, we make the following explanation : So long aschannels are established to convey a sufficient flow of directive requests from thebusiness community to the foreign services, we do not wish to make proposals for establishing such, channels which would ignore the &quot;representative character of theBoard of Trade in relation to the business community of this country. It is onthis point that the joint advisory committee proposed in paragraph 29 of thisreport will be most useful in establishing from time to time the precise relationsbet-ween the two Departments. It does not seem to us that by assigning to theproposed organisation under the Foreign Trade Department, and especially to thecommercial attache, the duties of the distributing as well as of the collecting sideof the intelligence system, we are, in fact, neglecting the representative characterof the Board of Trade, and we certainly do not wish to imply that the channelsshould not run through that Department in any case where the latter is preparedto undertake the transmission of the information desired. We do, however, feel it necessary to insist that personal touch of the closest and most constant kind[477] D
must exist between the Foreign Office and the business community, and we hardlythink that this conclusion will be combated by anyone.&quot;12. We are convinced that mutual relations so obscurely defined would lead toconfusion and overlapping of work and divergency of methods which would be extremely wasteful and highly inconvenient to the commercial community.It has, however, been urged before us in evidence? that a clear line of demaraationshould be drawn, and that the Foreign Trade Department should have exclusive chargeof the collection and distribution of commercial intellig-ence as regards foreign countries,while the Department of Commercial Intelligence of the Board of Trade should confineits activities to purely domestic questions and the trade of the United Kingdom with theEmpire overseas. There would, in fact, be two entirely distinct commercial intelligencedepartments the Foreign Trade Department, in Whitehall, and a department in theCity for internal and Empire trade intelligence.13. We are unable to recommend the adoption of this scheme. In our opinion it isessential, both to sound administration and to the convenience of the commercialcommunity, that there should be in this couutry a single department charged with the* compilation and distribution of commercial intelligence, from whatever source it is obtained. The manufacturing and trading interests of this country in Imperial andforeign markets overseas cannot be absolutely separated, and to compel the Britishmanufacturer or trader to seek information and advice as regards overseas trade from two separate departments, which would inevitably tend to work upon different lines andby different methods, would lead to serious inconvenience and waste of effort.14. Similarly, we do not believe that in connection with commercial intelligencework a distinction can satisfactorily be drawn between domestic and foreign trade. Inthis connection we entirely endorse the views expressed on the question of tradeintelligence by the Dominions Boyal Commission in their recently published final report.They write (paragraph 638) : &quot; It appears to us that any organisation for the purpose of fostering thetrade or commerce of a country cannot and should not deal solely with economicopportunities abroad. Enquiries in oversea markets can only be properly directedand the results adequately utilised in the light of a full knowledge of individualrequirements and industrial capabilities at home. The ideal Commercial Intelli-gence Department of any Government must therefore depend for efficient working as much on a staff of experts conversant with home industries as uponwell-trained commercial representatives abroad.&quot;We conceive that the soundness of the principles laid down in the passage we havequoted will meet with general acceptance. They are, however, cleaily inconsistent witha scheme such as that we are now discussing. The Board of Trade is the only Depart-ment of Government which is in a position to acquire the necessary knowledge ofindustrial requirements and industrial capabilities in the United Kingdom. the peculiar functions of the Foreign Office as the Department of Government concernedwith international relations are of quite a different order, and its staff, as is well known,is recruited under special arrangements, which have been designed solely in view of itsdiplomatic duties.15. We do not overlook the fact that the existing Foreign Trade Department,which has been established for the special purpose of administering the Statutory Listduring the war in&apos;certain countries, has thereby acquired valuable information relatingto British trade in those countries and possible openings for its extension. The control which that Department now exercises over British export trade for the purposes of thewar must, however, terminate with the war, and we strongly recommend that theexperience and information obtained by it in the course of its special activities, togetherwith such part of its staff as may be deemed advisable, should be placed at the disposalof the Department of Commercial Intelligence of the Board of Trade.16. We recommend therefore that the commercial intelligence organisation in thiscountry should remain in the hands of the Board of Trade. It has been represented tous that this arrangement results in a dual control&quot; of the consular officers and commercial attaches abroad, to which it is argued the existing defects of the service are due. We think that this criticism rests upon a misapprehension. The Departmentprimarily responsible for the trade interests of the country as a whole is the Board ofTrade, which cannot divorce itself from interest in, and responsibility for, the promotion of British commercial interests in foreign markets.    On the other hand, trade matters
are constantly interwoven with questions of general policy for which the Foreign office is responsible, and that Department must therefore be regularly consulted in connectionwith the administration of the commercial intelligence system, and must exercise control over the commercial agents of the Government in foreign countries. But we are convinced that, if the Foreign Office were to attempt in the manner proposed by theDepartmental Committee to place itself in direct daily touch with the commercialcommunity by means of the suggested panels of business advisers, grave evils wouldensue which would far outweigh any difficulties arising from the necessity for joint action in relation to commercial intelligence. The advisers of the Government on questions of commercial policy are and must be in the first instance the Board of Trade,through which the views of the commercial community should be obtained. But, ifbusiness interests had alternative access direct to the Foreign Office, the tendency would inevitably arise for that Department to have separate recourse to its panels of tradeadvisers, and to revise the recommendations of the Board of Trade in the light of itsown independent information, with the result that the Government might often receiveconflicting advice from two Departments, each claiming to represent the commercialcommunity.17. In the light of these considerations, it is our opinion that the proposals putforward by the Foreign Office Committee would be likely not only to cause incon-venience to the commercial community in this country, but also to lead to serious friction and embarrassment in departmental administration. The problem is one which mustbe met by co-operation and good-will between the Departments concerned, and, giventhese conditions, we think that the modifications of the existing machinery which we propose will be sufficient. We recommend that the general instructions to be given tothe commercial attaches should be drawn up by the Board of Trade and Foreign office in consultation, as has hitherto been the practice as regards the consular instructions.Particular enquiries which the Department of Commercial Intelligence may desire to address to the attaches should he transmitted through the Foreign Office and the headof the mission concerned. The reports of the attaches, whether made on their own initiative in pursuance of general instructions or in reply to specific enquiries addressedto them by the Department or by traders, should pass through the same channels. Inorder that co-operation between the two Departments may be ensured and delayavoided, we desire to urge that regular and frequent personal consultations should bemaintained between the Comptroller-General of Commercial Intelligence and the Con-troller of the Commercial and Consular Department of the Foreign Office.18. We are also of opinion that the advisory committee, to which we referred inparagraph ] 0, should be brought into more active relation with the Department ofCommercial Intelligence, and we concur in the recommendation contained in paragraph 646of the Final Report of the Dominions Royal Commission that a sub-committee of thecommittee should be appointed which should meet at frequent intervals and advise the Comptroller-General upon the current work of the Department.Although in our opinion the commercial intelligence organisation in this country should remain under the Board of Trade, we do not intend to imply that the activity of the Commercial Depaitment of the Foreign Office should be curtailed, and we thinkit important that business men should continue to enjoy the freest access to that department whenever diplomatic support for British commercial interests abroad is desired.19. The commercial attaches should return at regular intervals to this country,and during the period of these visits they should be utilised to the fullest extent bythe Department of Commercial Intelligence, and arrangements should be made by that department to enable them to pay visits to Chambers of Commerce at industrial centres and to meet traders.In addition to the foregoing arrangements, special trade missions should be arrangedwhen the circumstances appear to warrant such a course, and it will no doubt be foundconvenient that such missions should be undertaken in some cases by a commercialattache specially detailed for the duty, and in other by means of the temporary appoint-ment of an outside commercial or technical expert, the temporary appointment to he approved by the Foreign Office.20. We have only to add certain recommendations as regards the consular service which are connected with the subjects of our enquiry. As already explained inparagraph 1 of this report, we do not think that any useful purpose would be served by our attempting to undertake a general enquiry into the conditions of that service.Many of the criticisms directed against it arise from misapprehension of its properfunctions, and we notice that similar criticisms are common in other countries.   We
think that the defects, which admittedly exist, will to a large extent be remedied by the reforms which we understand are contemplated as the result of recent enquiries, by theestablishment of an organised service of commercial attaches on the lines which wehave recommended, and by the gradual effect upon the consular service of the prospectof promotion to the grade of commercial attache.21. The number of consulates and the staffs to be attached to them should beconsidered by the Foreign Office in the light of the probable requirements of british trade after the war. The evidence we have perused seems to point to a larger numberof consuls being required. Wherever possible consuls should be natural-born Britishsubjects.We desire to endorse the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the CivilService (Fifth Report, Part II, chapter ii, paragraph 6) that a longer period should be spent by consular probationers in the Department of Commercial Intelligence.22. We do not recommend any change in the existing arrangements under which that department is authorised to communicate direct with consular officers upon detailedtrade enquiries and their replies are sent to it. Care should, however, be taken at thesame time that the Foreign Office is kept in touch with the working of these arrange-ments, and we would suggest that consular officers should be instructed to forward tothe Foreign Office copies of all communications, whether replies to enquiries or reportsonh eir own initiative, which they may address to the Department of CommercialIn!, igence.Summary.23. Our main recommendations may be summarised as follows : (1.) For commercial intelligence purposes the consular service should be supple-mented by an organised service of commercial attaches appointed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, after consultation with the Board ofTrade. A selection committee should be appointed, consisting of repre-sentatives of the two Departments and two or three business men.(Paragraph 5.)(2.) The commercial attaches should receive diplomatic rank, and should be directly subordinate to the head of the mission in the country in whichthey are stationed. They should be recruited mainly by promotion fromthe consular service, but a free band should be kept to select officers fromother sources, and at the outset a proportion of appointments should bemade from outside.   (Paragraph 6.)(3.) The duties of a commercial attache should be primarily those of an intel-. Intelligence officer, although the head of the mission should not be debarred from utilising his advice in commercial matters and entrusting him withconsular inspections under certain conditions. He should be provided with adequate staff and separate office accommodation, if possible; should travel in his district, and pay regular visits to this country.    (Paragraphs 7-9.)(4.) There should be in this country a single commercial intelligence organisation,which should continue to be in the hands of the Board of Trade. (Para-graphs 13-16.)(5.) The general instructions to the commercial attaches should be drawn up bythe Board of Trade and Foreign Office in consultation. Particular enquiriesfrom the Department of Commercial Intelligence should be. transmitted tothem through the Foreign Office and the head of the mission concerned,and their reports should pass through the same channels. Co-operationbetween the two Departments should be ensured by means of regular andfrequent personal consultations between the Comptroller-General of Com-merciaT Intelligence and the head of the Commercial Department of theForeign Office.   (Paragraph 17.)(6.) A sub-committee of the advisory committee on commercial intelligenceshould be appointed to advise the Comptroller-General of the Departmentof Commercial Intelligence upon the current work of his department.- (Paragraph 18.)(7.) During their visits to this country the commercial attaches should be utilisedby the Department of Commercial Intelligence, which should arrange forthem &quot;to visit Chambers of Commerce and meet traders.   (Paragraph 19.)(8.) Wre add certain recommendations of detail regarding the consular service..(Paragraphs 20-22.)
Conclusion.24. The effective working of the intelligence system must, in our opinion, depend upon the cordial co-operation of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade. Whilelaying down the general principle that the Foreign Office should control the service abroad, and that the Board of Trade should control the organisation in this country,we recognise that there is a borderland where the two Departments must be in intimatetouch, and we desire, in conclusion, to emphasise again the importance of close personalrelations between their responsible officers.We have the honour to be, Gentlemen,Your obedient Servants,(Signed) FARINGDON, Chairman.W.

APPENDIX.Report of Foreign Office Committee.(I-)GENERAL PRINCIPLES.1. THE objects and functions of any Government organisation to promote and assist British trade in foreign countries are (1.) To collect, co-ordinate, and present all information relating to the trade,industries, and shipping of those countries in such a way as to (i.) enable the Government to form a correct appreciation of thegeneral commercial relations between the British Empire andthe several foreign countries from the point of view of british commercial interests ;(ii.) afford advice to the Government on questions arising in connectionwith the negotiation of commercial treaties and tariffs, based ona comprehensive knowledge of the commercial geography,history, legislation, and actual conditions of the foreigncountries concerned ;(iii.) enable the Government to furnish to British traders reliable information as to (a.) local laws, rides, regulations, and trade customs:(6.) existing or potential markets for British exports ;(c.) supplies needed by, or useful to, British industries, which areor may be produced in the countries concerned :(d.) openings for British capital in developing the natural resources and general commercial prosperity of such countries;(e.) suitable agents for British firms in foreign countries;(2.) To facilitate the efforts of British traders to get into touch with the mercantileand industrial community in foreign countries as well as with the national or local authorities where necessary ;(3.) To enable the Government to promote, and if necessary assist in negotiatingthrough its agents abroad, commercial or industrial concessions to Britishsubjects, where such concessions are of sufficient importance to call forGovernment intervention;(4.) To afford, within the limits of diplomatic or consular action, assistance incomposing or smoothing over any difficulties that may arise between Britishsubjects in the exercise of their trade or legitimate commercial activity, andforeign government or local authorities.^2. In order to carry out the objects above indicated, there must be (a.) a body of agents distributee! over foreign countries ; and(o.) an authority at home who appoints and controls the agents abroad; to whomthe latter report; and who informs and advises the Government and the trading community.3. The principles governing the intercourse between independent States require that the relations of each with each be treated as a unit and conducted, as a whole.For it is only a Sovereign&apos;or Government representing the State as a unit that is capable of entering into such relations, and, as the mouthpiece of the State as a singlebody, the Sovereign or Government must speak with one voice, that is, the voice ofthe particular officer to whom the conduct of foreign relations is specifically entrusted.4. There cannot be a British foreign policy as regards commercial matters abroadseparate from general foreign policy, of which it forms an integral arid important part.v * It. is not.the fuuetion of.;government agents in foreign countries to take any part in the actualcarryingypn of a trader&apos;s private business ; to,assume responsibility for individual commercial transactions ;to collect private debts; interfere in ordinary trade disputes; or intervene in private litigation on behalf ofBritish claimants, save in exceptional cases and on the express authority of the Secretary of State![477] &quot; F
There may be special agents charged more particularly with carrying on in a foreign country the commercial side of foreign policy. But if there is to be unity of foreignpolicy, such agents must derive their authority and receive their instructions from thesame Minister who directs the general foreign policy ; and, as a general rule, unity and efficiency in policy will best be secured by the greatest possible consolidation of all such agents with the permanent foreign service.5. Similarly, in so far as the Minister may have to be furnished with expert advice in regard to questions of commercial foreign policj&apos;, such advice must, if unityis to be preserved, be submitted to him by or through the Government Departmentwhose function it is to advise in matters of general foreign policy.(II.)NEED FOR LARGER ORGANISATION.6. We have thought it right^ at the commencement of our report to define the objects and the limitations of a foreign trade organisation, and we desire to emphasise the fact that one of the main reasons, though not the only one, for proposing a more comprehensive intelligence system on the lines of this report is the prospect of the enlarged duties likely to be imposed on the Government in the future.7. In the past, the extent to which, and the manner in which, commercial intelligence has been made available for the British trader has left much to be desired,but this cannot, in our view, be attributed, except in very small measure, to lack of energy on the part of officials either in the Foreign Office or the Board of Trade, and still less to lack of efficiency on the part of consular officers abroad. Much good work has, on the contrary, been done in all departments, and if the result has on the wholebeen disappointing, this is because there has been insufficient consolidation ofresponsibility or definition of duties necessary to a sound administrative system. Thesedefects have, in their turn, been fundamentally due to the fact that the nature of thetrade carried on, and more particularly the attitude of successive Governments towardsforeign trade, have been such as to cause no demand for any complete and activeorganisation by the Government which, while supplementing individual enterprise,might have tended to influence the policy and direction of that trade.8. For the last half century successive Governments in this country have not thought it right to take an active part in directing the development of foreign trade.This has resulted from various causes, and especially from the fear of governmentalinterference and from the competitive character of the relations of British tradersamong themselves. Distrust of governmental interference, a distrust common to bothtraders and Governments, has tended to create, in the mind of both, a confusionbetween the idea of interference and that of legitimate Government assistance, and thenormal reaction on trade produced by such-assistance has been wrongly regarded inthe light of dictatorial intervention.9. The British trader exporting to a foreign market has done so not merely in competition with Germans and Americans, but with his own countrymen ; in manycases, being slow to realise the dangerous extent to which German and Americancompetition was affecting the position of British exports, he has preferred to useGerman distributing agencies as more likely to enable him to maintain his own export business in competition with other British exporters, and he has therefore not placedmuch value on consular and commercial information or assistance which are open both to him and his British competitors.10. In comparing our commercial organisation with that of other countries, we haveto remember that in other countries there has been a constant touch between the Govern-in ent and the commercial community, arising from the periodical revision of highlycomplex tariffs. Such tariffs have not only necessitated a much more complete system ofcommercial intelligence on the part of the Governments, but have drawn together those affected by them into associations much more representative than any of our Chambers ofCommerce. This more complete intelligence system, and the better organisation ofthose for whose use it is intended, have reacted on each other so as to cause a definitedemand, which has obtained a suitable supply. Not only has this country omitted tocreate or use fully adequate channels of information, but other functions also of an efficient commercial intelligence organisation, such as the rendering of active diplomaticassistance in obtaining commercial or industrial concessions, or in obtaining orders forBritish supplies in connection with loans for foreign States, have been rarely exercisedexcept to some degree of recent years.
11. For these and other reasons, the Foreign Office has not been in a position todevelop an organisation such as exists in other countries and, in the absence of any effective stimulus to the systematic collection of information relating to foreign tradethrough the consuls and commercial attaches, the function of collecting such information has not been definitely allocated, but has been discharged partly by one department,and partly by another, according as enquiries chanced to be addressed to, or subjects ofinterest happened to be brought to the notice of, the Board of Trade, the commercialattache, the Foreign Office, or a diplomatic officer abroad. Diplomatic activity insupport of British trade has been inadequate in precise proportion as the collection ofinformation has been deficient, and the two are interdependent.12. During the war, however, we have committed ourselves in many ways which make a return to old methods impossible. A policy has, for instance, been adopted ofdiscouraging and, indeed, preventing British exporters from distributing their exportsthrough enemy firms established in foreign countries, and efforts have been made to findBritish, Allied, or neutral substitutes. This policy has been attended by manyinconveniences and some loss to individuals, due largely to the want of information asto the substitutes available. It is fair, however, to add that the aggregate export has probably not been affected seriously, for the British firms established abroad have succeeded to the trade previously done through enemy channels.13. These and like war measures are, according to the resolutions of the ParisEconomic Conference, to become, during the period of reconstruction after the war, thebasis of a policy consciously directed towards the maintenance of the QuadrupleAlliance against German encroachment. This not only provides a great opportunityfor the use of an extended and improved commercial intelligence organisation ; it also necessitates a very close observation of the tendencies of neutral nations, especially the United States, with whose interests 30 far-reaching an economic policy must be constantly adjusted by diplomatic effort, and it opens up a vista of complicated and detailed negotiations with foreign Governments entailed by any system of reciprocalcommercial arrangements.14. AVhile new demands are thus about to be made upon the Foreign. Office inregard to policy, the war will also leave on our hands a mass of information, more orless digested, which has been collected by the Foreign Office, the War TradeIntelligence Department, the Foreign Trade Department, and other departments inthe course of regulating war trade. The proper co-ordination, tabulation, and use ofthis information at the end of the war wdll in itself be a work of the first magnitude.Much of it has been concentrated in the Foreign Office, more than in any otherexecutive department, and the possession of this information in a properly digestedform will be of the greatest importance to that office in the execution of the new policyabroad. The method of dealing with all this information in such a way as to make itthe raw material for the discharge by the Foreign Office of its enlarged responsibilities in foreign countries needs to be carefully considered.15. Though the tendency of the above considerations leads towards the conclusionthat the commercial intelligence system abroad must be allocated to the sphere of theForeign Office, it is impossible, however the problem may be regarded, to create any organisation under the Foreign Office which will not depend for its success upon close co-operation between it and the Board of Trade, corresponding to the inevitable-interaction between the commercial and industrial policy of the country and its foreignpolicy abroad. In our opinion, the logical basis for such co-operation lies in the accepted principle that the Foreign Office ultimately controls, and the Board of Tradeadvises in, all questions abroad, while the Board of Trade controls, and the ForeignOffice may be in a position to advise in, questions at home ; the advice in each casebeing the product of the separate executive responsibilities of each department in itsown sphere.16. Thus, in order to cany out the new policy, and to base it on the newinformation already collected and to be collected in future, the Foreign Office must be linked far more intimately to the Board of Trade as being the department chargedwith the general, commercial, and industrial policy of the country than it has been before, and must be enabled to co-operate more closely and continuously with it.17. Many conditions which have been favourable in other countries to linking upthe commercial community with the Government commercial intelligence organisation will also prevail here, and what was probably impossible in the past has now becomenot only possible but a matter of urgent necessity.18. We are now committed to a national trade policy which will enter largelyinto the conduct of our foreign relations and may dominate them.
19. In future the instructions issued to our diplomatists must place trade and finance in a different relation to general policy than was the case before the war,and their action in regard to such matters will therefore take on a new character.Trade and finance can. no longer be things apart, outside the sphere of their *general diplomatic work. Trade and finance must become an essential subjectof their study. The way for this has been prepared, and the attitude of theforeign service has already been radically altered by the work done, the experience gained, and the information collected during the war, and it is therefore a questionof maintaining and extending tendencies already fairly well established.20. If this view is correct, there will be little difficulty in organising a departmentof the Foreign Office on large lines worthy of its importance. There must be nodivorce between those concerned with the trade side and those concerned in generalforeign policy, and care must be taken that, in emoluments, promotion, and ultimateprizes and rewards, this view is put into practice.21. Even if many of the assumptions made above as to the institution of a newtrade policy after the war were to prove erroneous, the necessity for the organisationwe are about to propose would remain; since a more vigorous and systematiccollection of commercial intelligence will in any case be demanded, and the controlof any organisation for that object by the Foreign Office is called for by the considerations put forward in the first section of this report. Moreover, British trade will need not only information, but specifically diplomatic assistance, closely adjusted to the trend of the information collected, and this essential duty cannot be properlyperformed if diplomacy and intelligence are under different systems of control.22. The main features ef any organisation seem to be : (1.) A Foreign Trade Department under the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, controlling the consular service and the commercial attaches,directing the system of intelligence derived from these agents and keepingtouch with those in this country who are engaged in foreign trade so as tomake available to them without delay the intelligence so obtained ;(2.) Such a measure of consolidation between the foreign service, the foreign trade Department, and the other branches of the Foreign Office as willenable the whole service to acquire knowledge of trade matters and of theworking of the intelligence system ;(3.) Close co-operation, through an advisory committee, with the Board of Trade andother departments charged with the care of British industry, internaltransport and shipping, so that the foreign trade policy, and the direction of intelligence in accordance with that policy, may be shaped and carriedout in conformity with the practical considerations arising on the one hand. from domestic policj^. and on the other from the situation in, and purrelations -with, foreign countries.23. W e have accordingly framed proposals for such an organisation on these lines.24. In proceeding to our detailed proposals, we wish to emphasise two points which apply to them generally : (1.) It would, in our opinion, be desirable that if the Secretary of state should approve the general scheme set out in this report or any of the suggestions for detailed organisation made in connection therewith, therecommendations so approved should, in so far as they apply to matters within the present competence of the Foreign Office, be put in force assoon as possible, and that, where necessary, detailed instructions in this sense shotdd be issued to the officials concerned.(2.) In considering the important questions of personnel, methods of promotion,salaries, &amp;c, arising out of our recommendations, we are precluded from making any very detailed recommendations by the fact that these questions are inseparable from the consideration of various recommendations madeby the Royal Commission on the Civil Service in its fifth report (1914), amatter which does not seem to lie within the scope of this report, and wehave consequently confined ourselves to a general statement of the require-ments which will be essential if the scheme here proposed is to be carried,out efficiently.
19205(in.)ORGANISATION OF A FOREIGN TRADE DEPARTMENT.25. A Foreign Trade Department should he created under the Foreign Office, and,indeed, within the Foreign Office. It should consist of three sections the ConsularSection, the Commercial Section, and the Section of Commercial Intelligence. The wholedepartment should be put under the immediate direction of a permanent official asController, with the rank and status of an Assistant Under-Secretary. The development ofthis department and the organisation of its work will demand great administrative energy,and the direction of its activities within the framework of the general foreign policy will make serious and continuous demands on the time and attention of the responsible minister. In order to assist and relieve the Secretary of State as much as possible inthe discharge of these duties, it is suggested that, following the recent analogy ofthe delegation to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, subject always to theSecretary of State&apos;s ultimate control, of the special work connected with the enforce-ment of the blockade, the Foreign Trade Department should be placed under asecond Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In principle, this isno very great innovation, since analogous arrangements exist already in the W arOffice and Admiralty. The relation of the whole department to the Permanent Under-Secretary is a point on which we only desire to touch tentatively, but we would suggest that while the second Parliamentary Under-Secretary should deal directly with the Secretary of State, the Permanent Under-Secretary must be keptconstantly informed of the work of the department by the circulation of papers,and the department must be actually under his supervision in order to enable him to carry out the requirement, which we regard as essential, that the staffof the Foreign Trade Department and of the other branches of the Foreign office should be consolidated by constant interchange of personnel.26. The additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary, or whoever will preside over theForeign Trade Department, must have the means of direct, immediate, and constantaccess to the Secretary of State. He must at the same time be equally approachableon his part by the officials of his department, who, in turn, must remain in the closest touch with the Permanent Under-Secretary, and with the staff of the political and otherdepartments of the Foreign Office. It follows that the Foreign Trade Departmentmust bodily he incorporated in the office, and be lodged under the same roof. we regard this as, in the long run, an essential feature of its proper organisation, whatevertemporary expedients in the matter of housing it may be necessary to adopt now, orcontinue, during the period of reorganisation, immediately after the war. Location in another building means separation and disintegration. The department would at once and necessarily tend to become a more or less independent body, correspondence wouldtake the place of personal intercourse, the necessary co-ordination and subordinationwould be gravely impaired, and rapidity of action on the lines indicated by theconstantly varying aspects of the complex play of foreign relations would become impossible.27. We are aware that the addition of a large new department to the existingestablishment raises some practical difficulties. But we believe these can be over-come once the necessity for this development is recognised. We are convinced,moreover, that a not inconsiderable increase of the normal staff of the Foreign office will in1 any case be required after the war, so that the question of fresh accommodationwill have to be faced quite apart from the creation of an enlarged commercialestablishment.28. In view of the emphasis which we have laid upon the close connection between the commercial side of the work of the Foreign Office and its political side,we recognise that the relations between the Foreign Trade Department and the politicaldepartments of the office and the exact methods of keeping the two in close touch aresubjects for careful consideration, but, given the constant supervision of thePermanent Under-Secretary, we see no difficulty in securing this. Experience may show that a closer consolidation of this or that branch of commercial work with thework of the political departments may be desirable, and devolution from the foreign trade Department may therefore become necessary, but we prefer to leave1 these possibilities to be worked out in the course of practical administration. It appears inany case self-evident that the transition from the war period, involving the&apos; collection and co-ordination of existing information and the elaboration of methods for taking advantage of, or where necessary continuing, portions of the war trade work as[477]   &apos; L G
elements in permanent policy will make a separate Trade Department necessary to begin with, whatever measures o  devolution may become necessary at a later period,when the lines of organisation and policy have been laid down.29. In order to carry out the recommendation made under heading (3) at the end of *the second section of this report (see paragraph 22 above), we propose that a permanentjoint advisory committee be constituted, composed of representatives of the Board ofTrade, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and India Office (say two members from each).This committee should advise as to the regulation of the respective spheres of theBoard of Trade and the Foreign Office; as to the maintenance of methods ofcommunication between the business community at home and the foreign service abroad adequate to secure a constant flow of information from one to the other; andas to the establishment of proper relations between the commercial intelligencesystem and the Dominion, Colonial, and Indian Governments.(IV.)THE WORK OF THE FOREIGN TRADE DEPARTMENT.30. The Foreign Trade Department wull have to undertake : (1.) The execution of trade policy abroad in general.(2.) The direction and administration of the consular and commercial attacheservices. Some suggestions as to broad lines of direction and administra-tion are given later in our Report.(3.) The digestion of the accumulated war trade information already alluded to,and the current intelligence work. This will be the duty of the Com-mercial Intelligence Section of the department, and is the main subjectof this Report. We must therefore make some general remarks on thenature of the intelligence machinery to be set up.31. Every intelligence system must necessarily consist of two parts, a collectingand a distributing side. The collecting side consists of the diplomatic service, the consular service and the commercial attaches. The distributing side is at presentrepresented by the Board of Trade and its Commercial Intelligence Branch. In orderthat the collecting side should act with the maximum of efficiency and the minimum of effort, it must be made to correspond very closely with the needs and requirementsof the trading community at home. This implies a strong direction from thedistributing side. Without it the whole system can be but partially successful, forthe absence of direction means a vast amount of ill-directed effort, waste of energy,and consequent loss in general efficiency.32. This much-needed direction has not hitherto been forthcoming from thedistributing side. Hence the cause of the failure of the commercial attache system andthe criticism levelled against both the commercial attaches and consular service.Experience has shown that the dual control exercised by the Board of Trade and theForeign Office over the collection and distribution of information does not conduce to full and harmonious co-operation. Whatever the causes of this defect may havebeen, there can be but one remedy for it, namely, that the purely intelligence work should be subject to single control under the Foreign Trade Department. There is evidence to show that the same difficulties as to allocation of commercial work betweenthe Government departments have been experienced in other countries, and that theprinciple of entrusting the intelligence branch to the department responsible forforeign affairs is gaining recognition in such countries as Germany, France, andBelgium.33. As a basis for consideration, the present Commercial Intelligence Branch of theBoard of Trade may be taken as showing the classes of work with which the foreign trade Department will have to cope. In Appendix I to this Report will be found amore or less detailed examination of these classes of work and of the methods whichshould be introduced to establish each class on a proper basis. It is sufficient here torecommend strongly the proposals made in this Appendix, and principally the proper use and publication of manuals of standing information and the compilation of detailedlists of foreign firms.34. While, however, the adoption of these recommendations will clear up and put ona business-like basis a large body of work, the partial discharge of which by the ForeignOffice and the Commercial Intelligence Branch has in the past involved much duplication,
-overlapping, and waste of energy, there remains the whole system of special reports from the &quot; collecting side &quot; on questions arising from day to day, as well as the annual reports for the various consular districts and countries. A detailed examination of thebest manner of systematising such reports is contained in Appendix II. AVe reeom-mend that the system stated in that appendix be adopted. At the present moment,there is, we feel, a deplorable lack of systematisation of such reports, resulting in which misdirected effort as well as in the absence of reports on many subjects of thefirst importance, owing to complete uncertainty on the part of the foreign services asto whether such reports are needed, or will be used, or noticed, at home. It is this want of direction and consequent discouragement of the foreign services which,in our opinion, provides the strongest argument in favour of the definite abolitionof any conditions such as, at present, entail dual control over the &quot; collecting side.&quot;(V.)CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FOREIGN TRADE department and THE  BUSINESS  COMMUNITY.35. A reference to Appendices I and II will show that the proposals there madeare wholly dependent on close touch being constantly maintained with the business community at home. This touch should be operative at all points of the organisation,and, so far as possible, in aU ranks of the service. The methods of securing this objectfaU under three heads : (A.) Direct Communication with the Foreign Trade Department.36. All the officials of the Foreign Trade Department should be freely accessible to business men. This applies in particular to the senior officials and &quot;to the com-mercial and assistant commercial attaches, who, during their periods of residence inthis country, should have offices in the department; but the efficiency of the organi-sation will very largely depend on the extent to which the junior officials of thedepartment are encouraged and given opportunities to act in the same spirit, and tocommunicate with, and take the advice of, business men in the course of their work.(B.) Panels of Trade Advisers.37. Advisers specially qualified to represent the needs and possibilities of particularbranches of British finance, industry, and trade are essential to any proper official organi-sation. The Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Board of Trade has attempted to fill this need by the institution of one large Advisory Committee, which is consulted on general matters of organisation and policy. There are, however, certain objections tothis solution. It is evident that the value of the advice which can be obtained by a department from its commercial advisers depends upon the extent to which the latter are actively engaged in the business about which they are consulted, and also upon thedepartments range of selection. Unless the department is to be spoon-fed by itsadvisers, it must have a certain freedom in choosing them from among the personsspecially qualified in each case. We therefore recommend that the expert advicerequired should be drawn by the Foreign Trade Department from a large number ofpanels, representing each important branch of finance, industry, and commerce. Inorder to secure the greatest possible range of advice, and to interest the largest possible number of business men in the work of the department, we recommend that one-thirdof each panel should retire periodically, and be replaced by new members. Theappointment of the panels, and the problem of keeping them free from improperinfluence or unduly self-interested motives, will always be difficult, but recent experience has shown that this difficulty is not insurmountable. Their functions nmst,however, be exclusively advisory, and they should not intervene in questions ofadministration.(C.) Visits to Centres of Industry.38. The senior officials of the Foreign Trade Department should, whenevernecessary and possible, visit centres in the United Kingdom with a view to acquaintthemselves with the situation and needs of the various industries and exports.   While
this responsibility must, of course, fall upon the senior officials of the department, thedepartment will, we hope, be largely staffed by younger men from all the foreignservices as well as by consular probationers. It has frequently been urged in allproposals for improving the consular service that probationers should visit theimportant industrial and mercantile centres in the United Kingdom before goingabroad. While we believe that such &quot;sight-seeing&quot; visits have their value as anelementary education, yet we do not think that real training is acquired in such ways,or in any way except by the actual discharge of professional work. It is therefore important that juniors and probationers in the department should, as their capacitiesallow, be sent periodically to centres of business in the United Kingdom. In thisway they could prepare the ground in advance for the visits of commercial attaches, orof senior officials of the department Avho may have to visit such centres on particularbusiness, and they would acquire, in the course of such duties, an acquaintance with the community and a knowledge of the local interests which would stand them in goodstead when they go abroad. The extent to which such a system of regular visits, byjuniors can be developed is one of administration, and can only be determined by experience, but we hope that it may be found possible to adopt the principle as are recognised part of the commercial intelligence organisation. The visits of juniors mustbe, to a considerable extent, subsidiary to the visits of the commercial attaches. Thelatter form, in a peculiar way, the direct link between the business community athome and the intelligence service abroad in all matters of current commercial intelligence.39. The present system of sending commercial attaches to visit periodically themore important industrial and commercial centres of the United Kingdom has suffered from certain defects which should be remedied. The visits were, in the first place,exclusively confined to granting private interviews at chambers of commerce. Thesepersonal interviews are certainly much appreciated by those who have taken advantageof them, but they do not, except quite incidentally, afford the commercial attaches anyinsight into the larger issues of industrial developments, or enable them to becomeacquainted with the needs and requirements of trades as a whole. For this, closertouch with trade associations, general meetings of- the chambers of commerce and similar methods are necessary. In the second place, these visits have not been broughtnearly prominently enough to the notice of the public, with the result that after nearlyten years&apos; experience it is no exaggeration to say that the great bulk of merchants and manufacturers are still ignorant of the existence of such a system. Again, the visitshave been arranged somewhat at random, and the commercial attache has been far too much at the mercy of the secretaries of the chambers, upon whose good-will thesuccess of these visits largely depends.40. In order to remedy these defects, the visits should be arranged with greaterdiscrimination by the central organisation, and should be more extensively advertised.They should be restricted as far as possible to the more important centres, and shouldbe notified to the chambers of commerce, trade associations, and other interested parties some weeks in advance. The Foreign Trade Department should acquaint itself,through the medium of personal visits to the local centres, with the nature of the enquiries with which the commercial attache will have to deal, should ascertain whether visits from other commercial attaches would be welcome, and should generallyencourage peox^le to take advantage of the Government machinery. In addition to thetime allotted to private interviews, the commercial attache shordd devote one day tocalling a meeting of the chamber to invite suggestions and criticisms on the system as a whole.41. With a view to utilise the results of such visits, the following system hasbeen adopted with very satisfactory results by certain commercial attaches for someyears past. The commercial attache draws up a report oh the visit in the form of printed memorandum, and&apos; circulates it to the consuls in the countries which herepresents.&apos; As there will always be a certain number of questions put to him whichhe cannot answer on the spot, the consuls have standing instructions to furnish theinformation&apos;required within one month from the date of the receipt of thememorandum. These replies&apos;are collected at the Foreign Office, their contents noted,and forwarded in a batch to the enquirer.42. Arising out of such regular methods of communication between the officialorganisation and the business community, it will probably become possible tosystematise many of the reports on particular industries which tend at present to beprepared by the foreign services in a. somewhat haphazard way, according to theinterests or ideas of each reporting officer.   For instance, it may be possible to obtain
from trade associations or other kindred bodies standard questionnaires on each trade or industry requiring regular reports from the foreign services, together with suchnotes on the nature of the industry as will furnish a guide to the reporting officer inhis investigations. Work on these lines is already proceeding. Wherever the system can be applied, it will be possible in future to make the reports on such subjectsuniform throughout the consular service, with the corresponding advantage that theycan be easily compiled and rendered available to the persons interested in this country.(VI.)POSITION&quot; OF THE BOARD OF TRADE IN RELATION TO THEFOREIGN TRADE DEPARTMENT.43. In order to avoid any misapprehension which may arise out of the proposals made in the preceding section, we make the following explanation : So long as channelsare established to convey a sufficient flow of directive requests from the business community to the foreign services, we do not wish to make proposals for establishingsuch channels which would ignore the representative character of the Board ofTrade in relation to the business community of this country. It is on this point that the Joint Advisory Committee proposed in   29 of this Report will be most useful in establishing from time to time the precise relations between the two departments.It does not seem to us that, by assigning to the proposed organisation under theForeign Trade Department, and especially to the commercial attache, the duties of thedistributing as well as of the collecting side of the intelligence system, we are in factneglecting the representative character of the Board of Trade, and we certainly donot wish to imply that the channels should not run through that department in anycase where the latter is prepared to undertake the transmission of the informationdesired. We do, however, feel it necessary to insist that personal touch of the closestand most constant kind must exist between the Foreign Office and the business community, and we hardly think that this conclusion will be combated by anyone.(VII.)ORGANISATION ABROAD.(A.) The Commercial Attache.44. Every part of the foreign services must be brought into active relation withthe Foreign Trade Department, but the central point of the organisation abroad mustbe the commercial attache. There is at present a considerable lack of system in thecommercial attache service. At this moment the service is composed of some tenpersons, drawn for the most part from the paid or unpaid consular service, withnominal seniority according to date of appointment, but with emoluments and conditionsof rank bearing no relationship to years of service. In our opinion, these conditions must be remedied, and the service must be built up into a regular branch of theforeign services, with definite methods of recruitment, promotion, and rewards. Alarge increase in the service, both as regards number of posts and size of staffs, suchas will in any case be found necessary, will make this possible, and a more developedgrading of the service will furnish the prospects and inducements which are at presentlacking.45. The commercial attaches should be mainly recruited from the consular service,and their posts should be recognised as a normal reward for efficiency in the discharge of consular duties, more especially of those relating to commerce. We do not wish to exclude the possibility of the appointment of Foreign Office officials or diplomats to such posts, as some freedom in this respect is a corollary of the principle of constant interchange of personnel which we have advocated in Section (III). Nor do we wish to exclude theappointment of specially qualified men from outside the services in particular cases, solong as such persons become members of the service in the ordinary way with all its implications, their fitness to discharge all the duties of the post being taken intoconsideration equally with their commercial training. But we do lay&apos;it down as a principle that the commercial attache service must be a regular part of thegovernment service, and that variations from the ordinary course of appointmentmust be brought within the same limits as those recognised as necessary to preserve the special character of the Civil Service in general, and to furnish proper professionalinducements to its members. The infusion of the professional business element intothe work of the commercial intelligence system is very necessary, but this elementwill, as a general rule, be supplied with better results, both to the public serviceand to the business community itself, by the appointment from time to time of[477] &apos; H
specialists to report on particular trades or commercial problems, as advocated inparagraph 70 below, than by a confusion of that element with the commercial attacheservice.46. The commercial attache should have his headquarters abroad, unless thereare special reasons against this in any particular case. He should, however, visit the *United Kingdom as often as possible. He should have diplomatic rank andbe under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s representative or representatives in thecountry or countries forming his district. He should not be a member of the chancery,and should not be expected to do the routine commercial work of the mission. Heshoidd, where possible, have a separate office and be provided with a separate staff.The size of the staff must be a matter for administrative consideration in each case,but we think that it should never be less than one assistant commercial attacheand a clerk.47. The post of assistant commercial attache should be a regular grade in thecommercial attache service, and consuls should pass through this grade beforeappointment as commercial attaches. The grading and rank of the service might follow some such lines as the following : Assistant Commercial Attache Second Secretary. After ten years&apos; service fromdate of first appointment as Assistant Commercial Attache First Secretary.After fifteen years&apos; service Counsellor; provided he has been promoted to thefull commercial attacheship.48. The commercial attache should be charged with the duties of consularinspection. If there is to be close and ordered co-operation between the consulsand the commercial attaches, it is absolutely necessary that the latter should beplaced in a position of authority over the consuls, and should be the intermediaryin general between the diplomatic and consular services. The function of consular inspection is a corollary of this position, and as the commercialattache must be in constant personal touch with the consuls, he can judgetheir efficiency more thoroughly and discharge the duties of inspection more economically than can be done by. the periodical visits of special inspectors,who have no function but inspection and no immediate connection with the work done by the consul. We are aware that the Royal Commission reported thatthey saw &quot;strong objection to entrusting these functions to Commercial Attaches,whose proper duties lie in another direction and are of sufficient importance to occupytheir whole time.&quot; But we think we are justified in disregarding this recommendation in virtue of our proposals as to the provision of an adequate staff for the commercialattache and his conversion from his present status as a kind of free lance into amember of a definite branch of the foreign service in every country. We do not,however, wish to exclude periodical visits of officials of the Foreign Trade Departmentto consulates, and indeed we believe that the officials of the consular section of that department should visit consulates as much as possible in order to get into touch withthe personnel of the services they are administering. This is, however, a different matter from regular inspection, and can, as a general rule, only be applied to consulatesin fairly close proximity to the United Kingdom.4V). Before passing on to other parts of the foreign service, we desire toemphasise as strongly as possible that the position of the commercial attache mustbe regarded as the key to the whole proposed organisation, and that unless thenecessity of proper pay and proper staffs is faced, the whole organisation must inevitably lapse into stagnation. However much the commercial attache may be assisted or supplemented by members of the diplomatic and consular services, or byexperts specially appointed from the business community to report on particularsubjects, it is in the ultimate analysis only by his constant activity and initiativethat intelligence and direction will circulate freely between the business community and the official service, and he must be given whatever pay and staff is necessary inorder to free him from routine office work and give his initiative full play.(B.) Diplomatic Service.50. Members of the diplomatic service should be accustomed to the idea that theyare expected to participate in commercial work as much as in political work.Proficiency in commercial work might well be made a qualification for the post ofCounsellor. Diplomats of all ranks shotdd pass periods of employment in the foreign trade Department, and juniors should, as much as possible, be employed temporarily in the commercial attached office abroad.
20351. We are in agreement with the recommendations of the Royal Commission thatthe post of secretary in charge of commercial affairs in the chancery, together withthe allowance attached thereto, should be abolished, and that it should be clearly understood that every diplomat is expected to occupy himself with commercial matters.52. The question of requiring some training in economic subjects for junior membersof the diplomatic service is well worth consideration. We hold strongly that the besttraining is always obtained by the actual discharge of professional duties, and thatthe economic training of the junior diplomat will be best carried out by giving him work during his employment in the Foreign Trade Department as well as abroadwhich will necessitate his taking the advice of, and co-operating with, business men.At the same time, we do not see why diplomats during their emplo\7ment at homeshould not go through some such course of training as that given by the LondonSchool of Economics to army officers.(C.) Consular Service,53. In view of what has been said above with regard to the commercial attacheservice, we have to consider the consular service, both as a service in itself and as apreparatory service for the post of commercial attache. We do not wish to overloadthis Report by detailed recommendations as to methods of recruitment for the consular service and such like. These, and many other points arising from our report, must be left to the decision of those responsible for the administration of theforeign services, and are hardly suited for the deliberations of a committee likethe present.  We only intend, therefore, to kvydown very general lines of improvement.54. The consular service is the base on which alone any proper commercial intelligence system can rest. The staffs and to a less degree, perhaps the pay of the consular service are at present often quite inadequate for the work. Consuls areoverwhelmed by duties which are, indeed, proper to the consular service and must always be discharged by them, but which, so long as the staffs are, as at present,reduced to a minimum, prevent the consuls from devoting their time to the duties ofcommercial intelligence. It is useless to devise any system of commercial intelligenceunless the attitude of the Government and of the country as a whole in regard to adequate provision for the consular service is fundamentally altered.(i.) Entrance into the Consular Service.55. The consular service must continue to be a regular part of the Civil Service.The training required is not the same as that reqiured for a business man in anyparticular line of business. The consul cannot, and should not, be an expert in anyparticular line of business. He has general functions of advice in regard to the wholefield of British trade, and requires a peculiar type of knowledge of that field whichhardly any business man possesses, and which no ordinary business man can beexpected to acquire in the course of the active conduct of his business.56. The peculiar training needed by members of the consvdar service can, aswe have already emphasised, be best obtained by the practical discharge of theirprofessional duties, and consequently that training must largely be acquired after theirentrance into the service. But they should come to the service -with a weU-trainedmind, capable of acquiring, with reasonable rapidity, the special knowledge requiredfor the service after they have entered it; and during the early years of their careertheir -work should he so arranged as to enable them to acquire that special knowledge.We agree with the Royal Commission that young men should be taken for the consularservice at an age corresponding to a definite stage in the educational system of thecountry, and we think that they shortld then, after entrance into the service, pass twoor three years as probationers, partly in the Foreign Trade Department, partly asassistants to a commercial attache, and partly as vice-consuls in large consulates. in exceptional cases they might be attached to a commercial house of a kind capable ofgiving them the largest possible survey of the general field of trade or to a chamber ofcommerce ; but this must largely depend on the extent to -which leading firms andchambers of commerce are prepared to take special trouble to train probationerswith the express purpose of fitting them for their official duties. We think it advisable to retain the system of preliminary elimination of unfit candidates by the Secretary . state, on the advice of a board of selection, constituted on the general line.?recommended by the Royal Commission for the diplomatic service, but including amember of the consular or commercial attache service, or both.
(ii.) Consular Staffs.57. Tlie number of officers attached to consular posts must be much increased insuch a way as to leave the consul or consul-general free from all routine duties andfrom many reporting duties of minor consequence, in order that he may devote histime to enqttiries needing initiative, leisure, and free intercourse with the local business community. This also entails that he should have time and money to travel freelyin his district. Not only must the staffs of existing consulates be increased, but thenumber of consulates must probably also be largely augmented. As an instance,we may adduce the case of Italy, where it has been pointed out that the district of HisMajesty&apos;s Consul at Milan, which includes the provinces of Lombardy&apos; and Venetia,contains the growing towns of Bergamo, Brescia, Como, Cremona, Mantua, Pavia, andVenice, all of which towns possess many trade possibilities, but none of which, exceptVenice, have a British Consular officer, while, similarly, we have no consuls in anysuch growing trade centres of the provinces of Turin and Emilia, as Alessandria,Cuneo, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Novara, and Bologna. Such conditions must be met,as each case may require, either by the creation of new consulates or by giving the, existing consuls time and money to travel in their districts. This applies with specialforce to Russia and the South American Republics.58. In general we need a great increase in the consular service in those countries where, trade is expanding, and is apparently responsive to the British effort. Therelative value to Great Britain of the trade of a country should form some indication to the consular staff required. While the figures of exports and imports are not a completeguide, the disparities shown between the staff and the importance of the trade of a country should be examined. For example, there are in France four consuls-general,seven consuls, and sixty-five vice-consuls, with total salaries of 16,000Z., and a totaltrade of 588 millions, of which 63 millions is with the United Kingdom. There arein the Argentine one consul-general, one consul, and sixteen vice-consuls, with totalsalaries of 7,S00L, and a total trade of 180 millions, of which 67 millions is with theUnited Kingdom. There are in Brazil one consul-general, five consuls, and twenty-seven vice-consuls, with total salaries of 16,3121., and a total trade of 132 millions, ofwhich 22 millions is with the United Kingdom. The explanation of this discrepancyis, of course, to be found in the number of sea ports in each country and the extent of theshipping work, but it indicates the undue extent to which this consideration hasdominated the distribution of consular posts.59. Such facts as these appear to indicate that a considerable reconstruction andredistribution of consular posts should be undertaken, after a careful consideration ofthe probable trend of British trade after the war. The question of the reduction ofunsalaried posts falls for consideration here. The usual crude complaints against theexistence of such posts have been effectually disposed of by the Report of the RoyalCommission, but many such posts should probably after the avar be brought Avithinthe salaried service.60. In this connection we should like to recommend that, so far as it is at allcompatible with the heaAry burden of avar avork now imposed on our consrdates,consuls should at once be instructed to make such tours of their districts as may bepossible with a vieAv to report on the need for increased consular representation, or,perhaps better and more feasible, that one consular officer should be deputed to takea general survey of the whole or part of various countries AA*ithout confining himself to his own consular district. We have had before us a recommendation to this effect from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Rome, avho urges strongly that stock should betaken of trade possibilities in Italy Avithout delay, and that Mr. ToAvsey, who has beengiven the honorary rank of commercial attache, might be deputed to take such ageneral survey.61. In dealing with the increase of staffs, there are two points which should beconsidered, namely, the position of consular and shipping clerks respectively. Theshipj)ing work is the most wearisome and distracting of the duties laid upon theBritish consuls, and, taking the service as a whole, it probably occupies more time than the whole of the rest of their duties put together. This Avcrk should be almostentirely taken off their shoulders by junior vice-consuls and shipping clerks, althoughit must be carried on under their general authority and responsibility.(iii.) Salaries and Allowances. .       ,62. We do not feel called upon &apos; to enter into any detailed consideration ofthe question of emoluments, and avouM prefer merely to lay down that they must be
sufficient to give the consul the social position in the local business community, theleisure, and the mobility corresponding to the duties outlined above. In a very largenumber of cases, better offices must be provided, and, where necessary, the consulateitself must be separated from the shipping office.63. But there is one point which we must raise, though we cannot decide it,namely, the possibility of increasing the funds at the disposal of the Foreign office for the administration of the consular service by the institution of a general system of consular certificates of origin and consular invoices. This is important, not only, oreven chiefly, for the income derived in fees, but for the fund of otherwise inaccessibletrade information which will thus be put at the disposal of the whole organisation.We would most strongly recommend that this proposal, which is now being putforward on all sides, should be carefully considered.64. We recommend that the system under which these or any fees collected by the consul are retained in whole or in part by him should be entirely reconsidered.(D.) Miscellaneous.65. There are some miscellaneous, but important, questions which remain to beconsidered in connection with the organisation of the commercial intelligence service abroad.(i.) Chambers of Commerce Abroad.66. British chambers of commerce in foreign countries are a most important partof the system, but at present such chambers have not in general been of muchassistance in the expansion of British trade, mainly for the reason that they are largelyformed by local business men who are disposed to regard the general expansion ofBritish trade only as an encouragement of competition with themselves. Certainfacts in regard to French trade may here be quoted : 67. M. Yves Guyot, French ex-Minister of Finance, says : &quot; Les chambres decommerce nationales a 1&apos;etranger peuvent rendre de grands services quand elles ont aleur tete des hommes a large vue, qui ne considerent pas que les residents groupesautour de la chambre possedent le monopole du commerce du pays dans leqiiel ils setrouvent et ne regardent pas avec inefiance comme des concurrents a ecarter lescompatriotes qui y viennent.&quot;6rf. Since 1SS3, thirty-six French chambers have been founded abroad, of whichtwenty-six are believed to be in existence to-day. They are maintained by thesubscriptions of their members and by government subsidies amotmting in theaggregate to 80,000 fr. a year.69. Recommendations have been made for example, by His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Petrograd in favour of imitating the French example of government subsidies tochambers of commerce abroad and, as a corollary, their control in certain matters atleast by the commercial attache and by His Majesty&apos;s representative. We think,however, that there are great advantages in His Majesty&apos;s representative being able to disclaim, as towards the Government to which he is accredited, any responsibility for the activities of the local chambers of commerce, and we do not therefore favour any control by government officials over these chambers, such as might follow from the grant of government subsidies. The maintenance of suchchambers of commerce is, however, an obAuous advantage, and if in some countries,as most probably is the case in just those places where they are most needed and where they would be willing to furnish the most assistance to British trade, the funds of the local British community are not sufficient to maintain the chamber, it wouldseem necessary that some provision should be made for financial support from theUnited Kingdom.(ii.) Special Enquiries by Experts.70. At the present moment there is a fund for the appointment by theBoard of Trade of commercial experts to report on particular subjects or countries.The fund is much smaller than that at the disposal of the Bureau of Foreign and domestic Commerce of the United States Department of Commerce, and this Bureau hasconsequently developed a much more extended system of special missions of this kind.We recommend that the fund for this object should be largely increased, and thatexperts should be freely appointed. They will be of utmost assistance to the officialorganisation which we have outlined in this report, and especially to the commercialattache. A regular system by which the consuls and commercial attaches, who are[477] &apos; I
not, and are not intended to be, experts, are supplemented by persons drawn from thebusiness community who are experts is, we believe, absolutely necessary.71. We have had our attention drawn to advertising periodicals published at berlin in Spanish by the &quot; Export Verein &quot; for Spain and Eatin America, and at new york in Spanish and Portuguese for Latin America and for Portuguese East Africa.These are examples of activities very rarely indulged in by the British mercantilecommunity, but which, we think, might with advantage be actively encouraged by theGovernment.(iv.) Relation of the Organisation to the British Empire Outside the United Kingdom.72. Some efforts have been made in the past to put the commercial work ofthe consular service in some definite relation to the Dominions, especially Canada.These efforts will be more fruitful in proportion as some measure of unity in commercial policy is secured between the different parts of the Empire. So far as commercial intelligence is concerned, some co-ordinating authority at least is needed to -advise incases where the encouragement of exports from the Dominions to foreign countriesappears likely to clash with exports from the United Kingdom. Questions of policy ofthe first magnitude are here involved. We can only express the hope that theorganisation above outlined will be an Imperial Service contributing to the commercialprosperity of the whole Empire, and we have made our recommendations with thisobject in mind.(iii.)

29210APPENDIX I.(A.) Present Work op the Commercial Intelligence Branch of theBoard op Trade.1. According to the reports of the Advisory Committee on Commercial Intelli-gence, the enquiries received by the Commercial Intelligence Branch and answeredfrom material collected from the diplomatic and consular services and the commercialattaches, as well as from the trade commissioners in the Dominions, can be classified asfollows :  - vNames of firms abroad engaged in particular lines of business in different     Ilocalities ; foreign and colonial contracts open to tender and other openings     Ifor British trade; foreign and colonial tariffs and Customs regulations ;     1commercial statistics ; regulations concerning commercial travellers and theirsamples ;  laws  affecting patents, designs,  and  trade marks in foreigncountries ; certificates of origin ; and trade conditions (terms of payment,credit, agency conditions, means of  recovery of  debts, &amp;c.) in  various countries.2. During the years in which the Commercial Intelligence Branch has been working, the number of enquiries received on these subjects has increased very largely.It is, however, to be noticed that, to a certain extent, such particular and separateenquiries and the answers to them should be unnecessary. Enquiries on such subjects as tariff and customs regulations, statistics, regulations concerning travellers, patentlaws, certificates of origin, and trade conditions would all be more suitably dealt withby the preparation and periodical publication of manuals of standing information relatingto the different countries. Such enquiries could then be answered merely by referring,in a printed letter, to the manual and page on which the information could be found.There would then remain only (1) some slight correspondence regarding the &quot; Boardof Trade Journal,&quot; railway and freight rates, and incidental foreign publications notlisted in the manuals of standing information ; (2) enquiries as to tenders and openingsfor trade, of which 767 were received by the Branch in 1912; and 3) enquires as to names of firms abroad and various other incidental matters connected withforeign trade, which form the largest item in the correspondence, amounting to 6,320enquiries in 1912. At present, the Branch answer the enquiries in this last categoryout of the unpublished lists of foreign firms prepared by the Branch. These listsare, however, of doubtful utility, if not actually misleading and dangerous, for theysimply contain names with no details as to standing, volume of business, connections,references, &amp;c. There should be some indication in these lists as to the importance of individual firms ; but, in addition, attempts should be made to obtain much fullerdetails in-the manner explained below.(B.) Standing Information.3. By standing information is understood information which, though liable to change, is yet of a more or less permanent character, such as &quot; commercial treaties,tariffs, all laws and regulations relating to commercial matters, transport and shippingarrangements, credit conditions, means of advertisement, lists of legal practitioners,information bureaux, &amp;c, &amp;c,&quot; in contra-distihction to &quot;current information,&quot; suchas tenders and openings for trade, which may be of value to-day but out-of-date to-morrow. At present a great part of the information falling within the formercategory is either not published at all or is to be found scattered in various governmentpublications, such as blue books, old consular reports, or the &quot;Board of TradeJournal.&quot; It is often fragmentary and out-of-date, but the main defect lies in thefact that  it  is  not classified nor readily accessible to the general public.    A[477] &apos; K
great public need would be met if all information on these subjects could be collected and published in a handy and compact form in the shape of a manual foreach country. These compendia would be kept up-to-date by means of an annualreturn from the embassies and constdates. It is claimed that this method of collectingand publishing information will have the advantage of (1) making it easily accessible to all; (2) preventing a considerable amount of unnecessary correspondence between government departments, as well as with the public ; and (3) maintaining itpermanently up-to-date, which, if not impossible, is very difficult under presentconditions. The more important changes reported during the year would, of course,be published as usual in the &quot; Board of Trade Journal,&quot; and would then pass intothe manual.(C.) Current Information.4. Current information is information of an ephemeral character, and consistschiefly in openings for particular articles of trade and commerce. It is suggested thatthe best method of dealing with this is (1) to classify articles under generic headingsand sub-headings; (2) to keep all such information in card index form, whichadmits of all obsolete information being easily weeded out; and (3) to instructconsuls and commercial attaches to furnish all information of this nature not indespatch form, but on cards of a prescribed size, under a generic head and sub-heading thus: Generic Heading. Sub-Heading.Leather      ... ... ...   Boots and shoes.Portmanteaux.Saddlery.Electricity  ... ... ...   Machinery.Cables.Fittings.5. By this means the sum total of official knowledge on any given subject is constantly ready for reference, it can easily be duplicated in as many card cataloguesas may be necessary, and much time and labour is saved by not having to register,docket, jacket, and minute papers on which there is nothing to be said and no actionto be taken beyond the normal distribution to firms or chambers of commerce thatmay be interested.(D.) Standing of Foreign Firms.6. In view of the importance of the enquiries in regard to foreign firms, and the defects in the present system of furnishing this information, to which attention hasbeen drawn in paragraph 2 above, it is recommended that the consuls,. under thedirection of the commercial attache, should undertake to send out questionnaires toall the more important and most trustworthy firms in their districts. These will contain the following questions : (1.) Name of firm ?(2.) Town and address ?(3.) Date of firm&apos;s foundation ?(4.) Does the firm act as commission agent ?(5.) Does the firm act as buying agent ?(6.) What are the firm&apos;s usual terms of payment ?(7.) What languages does the firm correspond in ?(8.) References in the United Kingdom firms or banks.(9.) References abroad.(10.) State in detail what articles the firm deals in.(11.) What firms does the firm already represent, foreign or British, and in whatarticles ?(12.) Is the firm seeking an agency ?   If so, state (a) in what article; (b) on what terms.
7. Any further particulars which the firm is willing to give concerning their capital or other particulars would, if so desired, he treated as confidential.8. Experience has shown that at least 35 to 50 per cent, of replies may be expected.The number will no doubt grow in proportion as the system is developed and found to lead to business. References to persons, firms, or banks in the United Kingdom, or theBritish dominions or colonies, as the case may be, are of course particularly valuable.It is recommended that consuls shoidd repeat this circularisation from time to time.The value of the system, however, consists essentially in proper discrimination beingexercised, only firms of known reliability being selected. It would add to the valueof these circulars if the consuls were to endorse the answers with their ownconfidential observations.9. Conversely it might be useful to obtain at this end similar information fromBritish firms for use abroad.APPENDIX II.Intelligence Reports.1. The reports to be furnished by agents abroad can conveniently be dividedinto three categories : (i.) Reports furnished in the ordinary course on miscellaneous subjects,(ii.) Special reports on industries and trade,(hi.) Annual reports.2. The ordinary miscellaneous reports can be left as they are, except wheresusceptible of being brought under the card system explained in Appendix I.3. The special reports should, where possible, follow a lead, as explained inparagraph 4j2 of this Report, and, where necessary, should be drawn up by expertsappointed ad hoc. These reports should he printed together for all countries bysubjects, and distributed to interested parties in this country. The collected reportscan be supplemented from year to year until it becomes necessary to draw up a newreport.4. No consular district covers completely any one trade or industry. The annual reports are, therefore, at best fragmentary, and are incapable of giving a comprehensive survey. For this and other reasons it is recommended that theannual consular report should not be published, but should he sent in duplicate tothe commercial attache to be worked up into an annual report for the whole country.The commercial attache- should send one copy home for the fuller information of theForeign Trade Department.5. The annual report should retain its character as a summary of annualindustrial, commercial, and financial development. It should not supersede or overlapthe special reports. It should be stated on the first page of every report that it isintended to be a general review of the trade of the country or district during one year,and is therefore supplementary to the separate reports on special subjects issued duringthe year, which it should enumerate. All matter belonging more properly to the manual of standing information should be rigorously excluded. Special attention should be paid to the following points: (a.) Taking the industries and trades in their order of importance, a summary ofthe most recent developments should be furnished, and where SpecialReports exist, reference should be made to them for more detailed information.   The four main points to dwell on in these summaries are (i.) Competition of third nations in the country concerned;(ii.) Competition of that country itself in its own home market;(iii.) Competition of that country in British home markets; and(iy.) Its ability to compete in third markets.(6.) Imports and Exports should be considered in their order of importance,and commented upon more especially from the point of view of theircompetition with British goods.   Statistics should be furnished.
(c.) Subjects of general interest bearing on industrial and economic developmentsas a whole should, occupy a chief place in the reports, and shouldbe dealt with comprehensively. Such as: tariff questions; legislativemeasures ; labour movements ; development of labour and capital organi-sation; education, technical and other; trade-unionism; politico-com-mercial tendencies; traffic and transport arrangements; industrial organisation (e.g., minimum wage legislation, co-operation, collective bargaining, arbitration, scientific management, profit-sharing, &amp;c), as applied to each industry rather than as general political phenomena;trusts,, cartels, and syndication; banking and finance; factory laws;municipal and poor law administration ; taxation, &amp;c.6. The subjects dealt with in each annual report should follow a prescribed order for the sake of uniformity. If thei*e is a real demand for the information at presentappearing in the annual reports, as to the growth of individual towns, including suchparticulars as population, telephone service, new harbour works, &amp;c, such detailsmight appear in a summarised form in an appendix. They seem, however, to bemore suitable for the manuals.7. Every five years or so it rnight be useful to issue a report on industrial conditions, as distinct from industrial developments, existing in the more importantcountries, for the purpose of comparison with those prevailing in the United Kingdom.Such reports should include a discussion of factory laws and conditions, hours of workand scale of wages, workmen&apos;s compensation and insurance, benevolent institutions,housing, cost of living, social conditions, municipal administration, trade-unions,r pauperism and thrift, elementary education, technical education, and so forth. Theywould have to be compiled at home from material received during each quinquennialperiod.
