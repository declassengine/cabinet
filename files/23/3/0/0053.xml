P. A. Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary.Colonel E. D. Swinton, C.B., D.S.O., Assistant Secretary.Captain L. S. Amery, M.P.representation to 1. The War Cabinet had under consideration telegram No. 1191Eussia. of the 4th August  from the British   Ambassador  at   Petrograd(Appendix I), and a corresponding telegram No. 1284 of the same date from the Military Attache at Petrograd (Appendix II), inwhich it was suggested that the time had come for making somerepresentation by the Allies to the Russian Government, to urgethem to place the affairs of the State in order, since disaster would inevitably overtake the Russian nation unless effective steps were- taken. It was pointed out, in this connection, that the French hadtaken up arms to support Russia at a moment when France could have escaped war, and that for this reason it might be of particular value if a separate message of exhortation were sent by the FrenchGovernment. The latest information from Petrograd (telegramNo. 1201 of the 6th August from the Military Attache&apos;)(Appendix III)) was to the effect that the Russians were complain-ing of the coldness of the attitude of the British, to whose opinionmore weight was attached than to that of any other Ally, and thatit might be of real assistance in this crisis if we gave a hint that,[1365-205] B
while we were ready to make any sacrifice to help a Russia whichhad a strong Government, our duty to ourselves and our other allies might make us question the advisability of helping a Govern-ment that delayed to take the necessary steps to restore discipline.The War Cabinet decided that-  *The question of the despatch of a message should be referred tothe approaching Inter-Ally Conference in the followingshape : That one message of exhortation should be sent from the allied conference as a whole, and that a second special message should be sent by the French Government.Salonica.Withdrawal of a division.2. The War Cabinet had before them a note from M. Pashitch(Appendix IV).In reference to this the Chief of the Imperial General staff stated That General Allenby, in order to be able to combine with the attack of the Arabs, and to be of assistance to General Maude,ought to attack in September : that on the other hand, his attackcould not be really effective without the help of a division from Salonica, and that consequently the immediate despatch of a division was of the greatest importance to the situation in Palestine.That General Maude stated that his force would be sufficient toenable him to hold his own up to the end of September.That the position in Mesopotamia involved the whole situationin Persia and India, that he had not a man in reserve, and that thepresence of an extra division in Egypt wrould consequently be of thegreatest importance to him, not only for the Palestine operations,but as a possible reinforcement to Mesopotamia.That the force at Salonica was amply sufficient against anyprobable attack, even after the withdrawal in question, providingalways that proper measures for defence were taken and that theforce were properly commanded.        ^^y^He considered that it wras very difficult to separate thequestion of the withdrawal of the division from that of the removalof General Sarrail, who did not enjoy the confidence of the other allied troops. In his opinion, if the troops were not properlycommanded there would be a risk in taking the division away, andso long as General Sarrail remained there would be no assurance that they would be properly commanded. For instance, if we withdrew the division, General Sarrail might still insist upon theremaining British divisions continuing to hold the 90 miles of frontwhich they have held hitherto, and that in any case we ran the risk,in the event of a set-back at Salonica, of being told it was our fault.Nevertheless, he considered that the division was required inPalestine without delay.The War Cabinet were agreed that the situation in Mesopotamiawas serious, and that, inasmuch as we were the only one of the Alliescarrying on the war in Asia, since the practical elimination of theRussian Army in Persia and the Caucasus, we were bound tosafeguard the situation there.The AVar Cabinet consequently decided that The immediate withdrawal of the division from Salonica shouldbe our first objective at the Conference.General SarmfsCommand.3. As regards General Sarraif&apos;s position, it was pointed outthat the real difficulty was not so much military as political, andthat the French Government, in spite of the promise already givento withdraw&apos; General Sarrail, could not well do so without being
French Appropria-tion of the Thessa-lian Harvest andSerbian Supplies.4. The Secretary of State for War drew the attention of theWar Cabinet to reports which had reached him that the Thessalianharvest was being entirety appropriated by the French for the use oftheir force at Salonica. He added that French authorities were alsobehaving very badly about supplies in other ways, and that not halfthe stuff wedestination.were sending to the Serbians actually reached itsThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toascertain what the facts were with regard to the Thessalianharvest.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 7, 1917.involved in a serious crisis, leading possibly to the fall of the Govern -ment, unless some other important appointment could be found for him.It was urged on behalf of General Sarrail that he had had to contend with great difficulties both as regards the composition ofhis force and the artillery allotted to it. It was also said by hisdefenders in France that he was hampered by definite orders issued to his subordinates, more particularly General Milne, not to supporthim in an active policy, and that documentary proof of this was in french possession.On the other hand, it was felt that, even if General Sarrailcould make a case for himself, he was unpopular with all the Alliedcommanders and their countries, and that this was a serious handi-cap to the military value of the Salonica force and to the support itwould get from the Allied Governments.The War Cabinet instructed The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to ascertain whether any order had at any time been sent to General Milnewhich could bear the interpretation put upon it by theFrench of a definite instruction to him not to supportGeneral Sarrail in an active policy.The War Cabinet further decided that The question of General sarrail&apos;s removal should not be raisedby formal discussion at the Conference, but should beraised informally, either before the Conference adjournedor subsequently.
APPENDIX I.Sir G. Buchanan to Mr. Balfour. (Received August 5.) *(No. 1191.) Petrograd, August 4, 1917.I HAVE received a letter from General Barter enclosing copy of his telegramNo. 1167 to War Office reporting his conversation with General Alexief and asking meto impress on Kerensky necessity for immediate restoration to military commanders of disciplinary powers and Russian Government putting military exigencies heforepolitical considerations in this grave crisis.As you will have seen from my telegram No. 1.190, we are at present without aGovernment, so that there is no one to whom I can speak. I agree, however, withGeneral Barter in thinking the time has come for the Allied Governments to tellRussia that, in answer to her appeal for co-operation in the West, we are makingserious sacrifices and shall continue to push our offensive so as to relieve the pressure on this front, but that we would expect in return she will abandon all polemical [sic]discussions and party politics and to concentrate all her energies on reorganisation ofher armies by re-establishing a strict discipline both among troops at the front and inthe rear, and by taking vigorous measures for repression of all disorders, for properworking of transport services, and for improving economic and industrial conditions ofthe country.I discussed the question with my French colleague this morning, and we agreedto telegraph to our respective Governments suggesting that we should be instructed to speak in the above sense either collectively or separately to President of the Council assoon as the new Government is formed.As it is impossible to foresee how that Government will be composed or what willbe its programme, it is difficult to decide beforehand the exact language which we ought to hold, and we would suggest it should be left to our discretion to adapt it tothe new situation with which we may be confronted in the course of the next few days.We might commence by congratulating the new President of the Council on hisaccession to office by assuring him desire of our Governments to give him all support and assistance in their power in his difficult task of organising national defence and ofconsolidating Russia&apos;s new-won liberties, and then proceed to say whatever we thinkmost suitable to circumstances of the moment in the sense indicated in second paragraph of this telegram.APPENDIX II.G.T.-1628. -Military Attache, Petrograd, to D.M.I.&apos; (1284.) August 4, 1917.WITH reference to Ambassadors telegram No. 1191 to Foreign Office.On military grounds, I think the time has come when we must risk a note to russian Government. We will be supported by all the intelligent part of thepopulation. The step is absolutely necessary, for the country is moving straight toruin as&apos;things stand at present. During past fortnight no real steps have been takento re-establish the prestige of the officers and discipline amongst troops in rear. Tilldiscipline is established in rear and troops are made to fight it is impossible to look forany improvement in the army at the front. Till discipline is established in the armyit is impossible to force the men in the railway repair shojjs and the mines to work,and, if they continue as at present, a general breakdown of railway transport in thewinter and a famine at Petrograd and in the army will occur. Kerensky is at presentthe only man with any magnetic influence amongst the Ministry who has not yetunderstood the necessity of discipline.None of his immediate military advisers are men of character. Socialists want to run a class war in preference to the race war, and this appeals to the mass of thesoldiers as being less dangerous.Tseretelli and others think they can run both wars simultaneously. We have totell Russian Government plainly that this is impossible.
APPENDIX III.Sir G. Buchanan to Mr. Balfour. (Received August 7.)(No. 1201.) Petrograd, August 6, 1917.FOLLOWING from military attache for Director of Military Intelligence: &quot; I had long conversation with Prince Tumanov, Assistant Minister of AVar,yesterday. He thinks Executive Committee of Council is losing power, and its influence is only maintained by efforts of few ambitious members. It has fulfilleduseful role in expressing wishes of advanced democracy, and he thought it would bereplaced either by a virtual dictatorship or by Conference of all Committees and organisations at Moscow. He said successive steps [? to] be taken in establishment of[? order] are : &quot; 1. Re-establishment of death penalty in the rear for persons subject to militarylaw.&quot; 2. Restoration to officers of disciplinary powers.&quot; 3. Limitation of powers of military committees.&apos;: 4. Abolition of committees.&apos;: I pointed out that meanwhile nothing is being done, and solution of problem ofsupply and transport on which the whole existence of the country depends, cannot be attempted until discipline is established. He said that it was impossible to go anyquicker.&quot; He thinks enemy objectives in the south-west are occupation of Moldavia for political reasons, and of Bessarabia for its supplies, but he agreed that enemy strengthwould probably prove insufficient.&quot; General Staff officer last night complained apparently of coldness of England&apos;attitude. He said that our opinion carries more w-eight than that of any other Ally.He suggested statement in Parliament of sympathy with Russia in her difficulties, witha delicate hint that, while we were ready to make any sacrifice to help Russia with astrong Government, our duty to ourselves and our other Allies might make usquestion the advisability of helping a Government that delayed to take necessary stepsto restore discipline.&quot;APPENDIX IV.THE Serbian Prime Minister presents his compliments to His Majesty&apos;s PrimeMinister, and begs to enclose an aide-memoire respecting the Salonica front, with therequest to take into favourable consideration the reasons exposed therein concerningthat front.August 6, 1917.The Serbian Government request the Allied Governments not to weaken theSaloiiica front, because they are convinced that by the loss of the Salonica front theywill lose the victory over the common enemy. There are several reasons supportingtheir request and conviction : 1. It is much easier to achieve a victory over the enemy on the Salonica frontthan on any other, where much greater reinforcements are necessary in order to securevictory. However, with a reinforcement of 100,000 soldiers for the Salonica army a victory over the enemy army on that front is almost sure.2. The enemy front in the Balkans is not fortified as in Belgium and France, andthere are not such numerous fortified lines, nor are they so armed as in the Westerntheatre, of Avar. Therefore it is easier to break the enemy front there than in belgium and France. There are places on the Salonica front held and defended hy the enemywhich are hardly fortified at all. A well-thought-out offensive Avould have a goodresult, provided that the Allied army has superiority in heavy artillery and in the
number of men. One, or at most two, victories, made the most of by pursuing thedefeated enemy, might give a turn to the war in the Balkans which could greatlyinfluence the course of the whole war.3. The first and the most far-reaching effect of a decisive victory in the Balkanswould be the separation of Bulgaria and Turkey from Germany and Austria-Hungary.Turkey, cut off from the West, the source of her war material, would be soon reducedto impotence by British and Russian armies in Asia Minor. *4. A subjugated and occupied Bulgaria would enable the Western Allies to come in touch with the Russian and Roumanian armies, a fact whioh would shorten the warand ensure a most decisive victory over the enemy.5. Germany and Austria-Hungary take for themselves about 2,000,000,000kilogrammes of corn from the Balkans, thus feeding about 6,000,000 men. this quantity can be increased by an intense cultivation, which they undoubtedly do.Besides this, the Central Powers get from those countries coal, copper, timber, vegetables,petrol, benzine, &amp;c, and by the loss of the Balkans they would lose that tremendoussource of supply.Consequences of a Weakening of the Salonica front.1. The Allied Army at the Salonica front has never been superior in strength to the army of the enemy, and in spite of that there have been some successes.Were the Allied Army stronger in number and artillery it might have made more of the successes. If England withdraws one more division the Allied Army will get weaker, and there is no doubt that the enemy will take advantage of the fact.2. The enemy is fully aware that the United States are about to send an army to Europe; that the confusion in Russia will not last very long; that the greek army is gaining strength, and that therefore an early decision on any front to theadvantage of Germany is the only means of paralysing the prospective increase ofthe Allied strength. It follows that a weakening of the Salonica front would be astrong temptation to the enemy. JThe weakening of the Salonica front would spell catastrophe for that front andmight have far-reaching influence on the whole issue of the war. The public opinion in Greece would turn against M. Venizelos and the Allies. The Greek people rnayfeel that they are left to themselves at the moment of a very grave crisis, andunpleasant events may ensue.The Serbian army, 350,000 men strong before the retreat; after the great tragedyreduced to 120,000 men, and after the great battles in the autumn of last year and ofthis spring reduced to about 70,000 men, would be perfectly ruined by the weakening of the front in the Balkans. Moral and trust in a sincere help of the Allies wouldvanish in the Serbian people, who have lost everything except their honour.The same revulsion of feeling would take place in Roumania.3. A decision in the Balkans in favour of the Central Powers may have fatalconsequences for the subsequent conduct of the war. A part of the Bulgarian and turkish forces would be set free for other theatres of the war ; the submarine bases inthe HCgean may be increased, and communication between Egypt and Great Britainendangered more than ever ; and the Central Powers might be encouraged by successto seek for a decision before the United States enter the war with their full force and before Russia would be able to recuperate.In the name of these reasons, the Serbian Government request the BritishGovernment not to withdraw one single unit of the Army from the Salonica front, butto strengthen it in the very interest of the Allied cause.August 3, 1917.
