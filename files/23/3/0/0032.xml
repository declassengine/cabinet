Shipping Losses: 1. THE War Cabinet resumed the discussion, commenced onControl of the previous day (War Cabinet, 183, Minute 2), on the Control ofMerchant Shipping.   Merchant Shipping.Sir Norman Hill stated that the result of the visit of LordInchcape, Sir John Ellerman and himself to the Admiralty, on theprevious day, confirmed the view stated in the penultimateparagraph of the Admiralty Naval Staff Memorandum of the 1st Julv(Paper G.T.-1273), which reads-&quot; The whole of our war experience has shown that a fairmeasure of protection to shipping can only be guaranteed by asystem of individual escort consisting of at least two fast patrol craft, or by arranging for ships to sail in groups with an escorton practically the same basis.&quot;This did away with the theory of areas of concentration and protectedlanes, which had been the practice up to a recent date. He statedthat, the First Sea Lord had informed him that, provided elevenUnited States destroyers continued to be available, there was asufficient force to provide four escorts every eight days. Sir NormanHill therefore wished the War Cabinet to consider the question of only running such ships as could be given the fair measure ofprotection which such escorts provided. This would approximateto the use of one-half of our ships, the other half being placed in reserve in port or utilised on other and safer trade routes.As regards the question of increasing the cargoes carriedduring the summer months, it was pointed out that previous to thewar 98 tons weight was carried for each 100 tons net of shipping,whereas the weight carried had now been increased to about 140,and that by any further loading we should not derive any benefit,as the loss in speed would balance the gain in weight.The First Sea Lord pointed out that twelve more destroyersmight be available in three months&apos; time for escort duties, butpossibly this increase might be counterbalanced by the taking awayof the United States destroyers to convoy their own troops. he further pointed out the danger of big enemy submarines working in mid-Atlantic, and the possibility that escorts would have to beprovided for the whole journey, so that the crews of any ships sxmkmight be rescued, instead of being cast adrift hundreds of milesfrom land.Lord Inchcape stated that he gathered from the information obtained at the Admiralty that the only practical means of combatingthe submarine menace (though many auxiliary methods of attackwere employed) was the destroyer, and he strongly advocated alarge building programme for destroyers, or other effective anti-submarine craft. At present we were only defending ourselves andnot attacking, and if we continued to lose at the present rate itmight be difficult to get merchant seamen to go to sea, owing totheir moral breaking down.Sir John Ellerman endorsed this proposal, and further pointedout the desirability, before the winter months came along, of onlyconcentrating on the Atlantic trade such vessels as, by their con-struction and speed, were suitable to withstand - the heavy weatherthat prevailed. Further, he was of opinion that if such were not done the convoy system, owing to the unequal speeds of the variousships forming the convoys, must break down.The Shipping Controller stated that this aspect of the allocation of ships had not been lost sight of, that the convoy system had notbeen properly tried yet, and that a definite statement as to itsefficacy could not be pronounced at present.The War Cabinet were of opinion that. the submarine is theone menace that might defeat us, and that, from the point of viewof the whole alliance, it is most important to concentrate every possible effort on the protection of trade in the approaches to theUnited Kingdom.
The Eastern Front. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the recent advance of the Russian Army had been over a length of 35 miles to a depth of 15 miles, and that their objective Avas probably Stryj. He added that he had been informedthat the 11th Russian Army had not fought well, but that, on thewhole, the Austrians had shown a similar tendency, and that theGerman troops captured were of poor quality. He had received information that the 81st Austrian Regiment had surrendered in a body, and that, as regards gunfire, the Russians were firing fifty--rounds to one round of the enemy.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived information from Petrograd that the effect of the offensive on aU classes in Petrograd had been excellent, and that in a recentdemonstration the Russian National Flag had been carried throughthe streets for the first time since the revolution in substitution forthe Red Flag.Russian Casualties. 3. It was stated that the Russian casualties during the first three days of their offensive had, as regards eight divisions, only been 5,000 men.Mesopotamia. 4. The Chief of  the Imperial General Staff reported  that information had been received from the General Officer Com-manding, Mesopotamia, to the effect that he had advanced fromFeluja and found the Turks too strong, and had therefore proposedto retire to his original positions. Later information from GeneralMaude led him to think, however, that - the enemy contemplated[1365-184] B 2The War Cabinet postponed the further consideration of thisquestion until Friday next, the 20th July. In the meantime they decided that (a.) The Shipping Controller should be requested to go further into the matter of cutting down the number of shipsactively employed, with a view to the utilisation of a portion of the ships as a reserve, hearing in view thevarious requirements of essential imports for the conductof the war and the civil population.(6.) The Admiralty should consider the redistribution of the anti-submarine craft at their disposal, with the object of setting free the eighty-eight destroyers required for theestablishment of a daily system of convoys in the atlantic with the least possible risk elsewhere. Theyshould be prepared to report next Friday the degree ofrisk involved elsewhere by any such system of redistribution-tribution, in order that the War Cabinet might decide-   whether the risk is to be taken or not.(e.) With a view to economy in force, the Admiralty should consider the degree of risk involved in the provision of smaller escorts for convoys than have hitherto beendeemed essential.The War Cabinet further requested The Shipping Controller, the First Sea Lord, Sir Norman Hill,Lord Inchcape, and Sir John Ellerman (with CaptainClement Jones as Secretary), to meet together and, havingcalled to their assistance any merchant captains that theymight think desirable, to report on the foregoing points onFriday next, 20th July, 1917.
retreating,and he was therefore making his plans accordingly.General Maude stated that the percentage of sick in June was 7 percent., as compared with 19 per cent, last, year.Arabia.5. With reference to War Cabinet 181, Minute 15, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that he had received a report thatthe railways had been cut by Captain Lawrence, and that it was a highly praiseworthy operation.Submarines. fj. The First Sea Lord stated that a telegram had been received that the special service vessel &quot; Heligoland &quot; had sunk a submarineyesterday off Land&apos;s End, and that the flotilla leader &quot; Anzac,&quot;working in co-operation with destroyers attached to the KiteBalloon Section, had sunk another submarine 70 miles east of the shetlands.Air said onDardanelles.7. The First Sea Lord reported an air attack on the Dardanellesin which a tug had been sunk in Chanak Bay.Merchant shipping losses.8. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet, with regardto the losses of merchant ships by enemy action, that the followingwas the percentage of German exaggerations over the facts : FebruaryMarchAprilMayJunePer cent.4549254548MesopotamiaAdministrationCommittee :Extended Powers.9. The War Cabinet decided to enlarge the scope of the dutiesof the Mesopotamia Administration Committee, in order to enablethem to deal with questions affecting the Middle East.Lord Milner, in view of his many other duties, expressed a desire to relinquish his membership of this Committee, and theWar Cabinet decided To request Mr. Balfour to take his place, and to appointGeneral Macdonogh as the Military Representative on theCommittee.Control of MilitaryForces at Aden.10. It was decided that The question of the control of military forces at Aden shouldbe referred to this Committee.Extension of theQuetta-NixshkiPail way.11. It was decided that The question of the extension of the Quetta-Nushki Railwayshould be referred to this Committee.The agricultural programme.12. With reference to War Cabinet 170, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (Paper G.T.-1279) and a Memorandum by Sir Arthur Lee(Paper G.TV-1.349). It was pointed out that the War Cabinetinstructions of the 27th June was that the Army should furnish
5,000 men a week for ten weeks, beginning in the first week inJuly, tbe first five contingents being men of previous agriculturalexperience, or in any case men used to handling horses.Lord Derby stated that 5,000 agriculturists in classes other thanClass A were not available, unless men were brought back from france and Mesopotamia.Lord Derby further protested against the policy of not dichargingmen who were to be sent to agriculture, on the ground that it was a form of industrial compulsion, that being a principle which he hadpledged himself not to support. He agreed that if the wholequestion were reconsidered in six weeks&apos; time, it could for the .time be looked upon as only a temporary expedient, and the men to beconsidered as lent to agriculture in the same way as they were inthe spring.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The present system whereby the Army furnished men for agriculture without discharging them should be con-tinued, on the understanding that it is temporary, untilthe question of industrial compulsion is raised.(o.) The Secretary of State for War should ascertain how manytrained agriculturists there are in the Army in Englandas well as in France, and report to the War Cabinet assoon as possible.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 13, 1917.
