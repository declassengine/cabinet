THE War Cabinet continued their discussion of yesterdayrelative to the provision of labour for the Agricultural Programme(War Cabinet 169, Minute 15).The Secretary of State for War made a strong protest against this question being considered outside that of the general question ofman-power. This was a claim for 50,000 men from the Army, whowould be deducted either directly or indirectly from the fightingforce. He understood that an application would shortly be made bythe Admiralty for another 120,000 men for shipbuilding. lord derby pointed out that, apart from the agricultural companies,which numbered 9,800, the Army had already lent for agricultural purposes 36,000 men, that it was impossible to find the balance now required from the Home Defence Force; it equally was unthinkableto withdraw men actually serving in  France,  and they would[1365-170]B
therefore have to be taken from those who were serving in england in positions which might otherwise have to be filled by men of category (A).Lord French stated that he considered that, owing to the reductions that had already taken place, we were in a dangerousposition if raided by a force of, say, 70,000 men.Lord Derby insisted that it was highly undesirable that thgmen should be lent from the Army, owing to the suggestion that, onthe pretext of bringing in men for Military Service, industrialcompulsion was indirectly being introduced by appropriating themfor civilian labour, and, though he himself was strongly in favour ofa legalised open system of industrial compulsion, he could not be a party to any form of temporary release, and therefore consideredthat they should be discharged from the Army.Lord Derby pointed out that it was impossible to arrange thatthe men should have had previous agricultural experience, as he hadno information as to the number of men coming under that head whowere serving in this country. Personally he did not believe therewere anything like the 25,000 which were asked for in the first five weeks. He also pointed out that the date on which the decision was arrived at was so near the 1st July that, although every effort would be made to comply with the order, it might be physicallyimpossible to do so.- In this connection the Field-Marshal stated that the men released for agriculture were entirely useless for Home Defence, buthe admitted that, if orders were at any time received that everyavailable man was to be sent abroad, it would be advantageous still to have these men as members of the Army rather than as civilians,as they would be more readily procured for service.The War Cabinet felt, however, that there were serious disadvantages in discharging these men ; even though useless for meeting an invasion, a decision with regard to which would be settledone way or. the other before they could be recalled and renderedefficient, they would, nevertheless, be of great value as a reserve if a sudden emergency should arise. They felt some doubt also as towhether the objection to loaning men for agriculture would beregarded as an application of the principle of industrial compulsion,more particularly the men required to meet a special and possiblytemporary emergency, and of such vital importance for the successful prosecution of the War.Having regard to the imperative need, in the present situation,of carrying out the agricultural programme for which the men askedfor by Lord Milner are essential, the War Cabinet decided that: (a.) No more whole-time workers should be taken from the landexcept with the consent of the County agricultural committees.(6.) The men now lent to agriculture till the 25th July shouldbe allowed to remain after that date, except in so far asthey are replaced by other men from the Army of thesame quality.(c.) In addition to the above, the Army is to furnish 5,000 mena week for ten weeks, beginning with the first week inJuly, the first five contingents being men of previousagricultural experience, or in any case men used tohandling horses.All these men, like those in (b), are to be allowed to remainin agricultural work unless replaced by others from theArmy of the same quality. The 17,000 men to belent by the Army for the hay and corn harvests, or as many of them as may be allowed to remain in agriculturewhen these harvests are over, are to be regarded as a deduction from the number to be furnished by the Armyin the five later weeks.
The Overland ^ 2. With reference to War Cabinet 128, Minute 12, the WarRoute to salonica.     Cabinet had under consideration the question of the completion ofthe Cherbourg-Taranto route, and W.P. Paper No. 16 (Appendices I,II, and III), which set forth draft agreements between the Britishand French Governments.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that, to provide thelocomotives, it was essential that materials should be provided bythe Ministry of Munitions for the repairs of those now in the UnitedKingdom and elsewhere.The Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that the question ofthe shortage of railway material had been, referred to a committee under the presidency of Lord Milner.The War Cabinet approved the draft agreements, subject to thedifficulty of the supply of material for repairs being satis-factorily surmounted.The Secretary of State for War undertook to communicateapproval to the French authorities in due course.Shortage of oats and Forage in italy.3. The War Cabinet considered the Note of Sir Wyldbore Smith(Paper G.T.-1161) relative to the shortage of oats and forage in italy, and, in view of the serious situation disclosed, decided that The Secretary of State for War should release the steamship&quot; Langhorne &quot; for the carriage of oats at the earliest possible date; and the Shipping Controller should allot anothervessel for the same purpose as soon as possible.Passports for 4. It was brought to the notice of the War Cabinet that aRussia. Miss Longman had received an invitation from the Soldiers and workmen&apos;s Committee in Petrograd to proceed to Russia, and thata doubt had been expressed as to whether the War Cabinet decision as to a passport not being granted in the case of Miss SylviaPankhurst (War Cabinet 165, Minute 1) was to hold good as regardsMiss Longman.As the cases were not parallel, inasmuch as Miss Longman hadreceived an invitation whereas Miss Pankhurst had not, the WarCabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to deal with MissLongman&apos;s application for a passport as he might think fit.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 27, 1917.The War Cabinet requested--The Secretary of State for War to take the necessary steps tog-ive effect to these decisions, arranging as requisite withthe President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Secretary of State for War undertook further to considerthe question of whether the men allocated to agriculturewere or were not to he discharged, and to report to theWar Cabinet on the subject.

APPENDIX HI.Conference held at Paris on June 19-20, 1917, at the Ministere des Transports.Present :M. Claveille.Colonel Maurier.Colonel Payot.Colonel le HenafF.Sir Guy Granet.Major-General Nash.Brigadier-General Mance.Lieutenant-Colonel Henniker.I. Locomotives.I. It was agreed that the engagement of the British Government as regards theimportation of locomotives was that for the service of the British Army up to theDunkirk, Lille, Maubeuge line, they would import 609 main line locomotives.2. It was agreed that, up to the 1st June, 1917, 402 locomotives had been putinto service. Of these 402, 37 are shunting engines, 86 are 0-8-0 engines, and 279are 0-6-0 engines.3. It was pointed out by M. Claveille with reference to the above figures that the engines that he required for the movement of military trains were cf the higher power,and that the employment of the six-wheeled engines often necessitated double-heading.4. It was agreed that the British Government should increase the number of mainline locomotives to be imported by them to 800.5. It was further agreed that the British Government would use their best endeavours to secure that, out of that number, 700 should be imported into France bythe month of November.6. It was further agreed that the 298 locomotives to be imported under thepreceding paragraph between now and the month of November should, so far as waspossible, consist of higher-powered engines.7. The British Government undertake to keep in proper repair all the locomotiveswhich they are undertaking to introduce into France, and to provide the correspondingnumber of crews.8. The British Government undertake to assist the French Government in the shipment of locomotives which the French Government have on order in the UnitedStates.II. Waggons9. It was agreed that the British Government had undertaken to import intoFrance, for the use of the British armies based upon approximately the present front,the equivalent of 27,000 10-ton waggon units, and to increase their import to the equivalent of 42,000 10-ton waggons in the event of an advance to the Belgian-german frontier.10. Of this number it was agreed that there were in traffic on the 1st June, 1917,the equivalent of 22,198 10-ton units.II. It was agreed that, in order to obtain a more accurate figure of the numberof waggons put into traffic, the actual marking and handing over of such waggons to theFrench Government should now be done at Audruicq instead of at Sotteville. It was stated that a weighbridge would be necessary, and this the French Governmentundertake to find.12. It was noted that the British Government intend to continue the importationof waggons freely after the date at which the 27,000 10-ton units have arrived inFrance, and to compensate for the French waggons used on the Cherbourg-Tarantoservice, and to meet any fresh requirements.13. M. Claveille wished to be informed by what date the 27,000 10-ton unitscould be expected to, be in traffic. General Nash stated that he had no doubt thatthat number would be in traffic by the end of J uly.
14. M. Claveille pointed out that difficulties had arisen with reference to thedespatch to France of the engines ordered by the Etat and Paris-Orleans Railwaysfrom the North British Locomotive Company and Nasmyth, Wilson, and Co., as wellas the 2,637 waggons which had been bought and paid for by the P.L.M., the Midiand the P.O. Railways from the Birmingham Carriage and Waggon Company, fromthe firm of Bornazzi, and from Messrs. Edmunds and Radley. A note was taken ofM. Claveille&apos;s representation, and it was agreed to ask the British Government thatany restriction on the export of these waggons might be removed.15. M. Claveille raised the point that, owing to the handing over of French foreststo the British Government for the purpose of supplying timber to the British armies, agreater number of French railway waggons would be required. As against this it waspointed out that, to the extent that timber was produced locally, to that extent timberwould not be imported, and there would be a corresponding diminution in the waggonuser from the ports. M. Claveille pointed out, however, that timber imported involvedonly a short haul, whereas a considerable amount of the timber produced locally might come from long distances, such as the Jura forests. It was agreed in principle thatif, owing to the increased distance of haul, an increased user on balance of Frenchrailway waggons was necessitated, the British Government would accept the obligationto provide an equivalent number of waggons in excess of their undertaking.16. The above agreement is subject to the approval of the French and british governments.(Signed) W. GUY GRANET.N. F. M. NASH.A. MAURIER.joint. General.
