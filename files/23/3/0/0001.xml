Prisoners of War. 1. THE  Secretary of  State for War and  General Belfieldinformed the War. Cabinet that there was little doubt that our prisoners in Germany were being extremely badly treated, and therewas even evidence that there was a good deal of indiscriminate firingby sentries and others at British prisoners of war.With reference to the meeting in Holland approved by WarCabinet 152, Minute 20, Lord Derby urged that, instead of themeeting of British and German officials in charge of prisoners ofwar, the Dutch Government should be asked to nominate a Chairmanof the meeting.The War Cabinet approved the proposal, and decided that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should makethe necessary communication to the Dutch Government.Reprisals 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War, dated the 30th May, 1917 (paper g.T.-876), suggesting the establishment of a small committee, witha member of the War Cabinet.as Chairman, consisting of representa-tives of the Foreign Office, Admiralty, and War Office, to considerall questions involving the possibility of reprisals.The War Cabinet delegated to Lord Curzon, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for War and the Heads of theDepartments concerned, full powers for the settlement ofthese questions.3. The War Cabinet had before them Lord Curzon&apos;s Report(Paper G.T.-925) on the recent Air Raid, prepared in accordancewith Minute 9 of War Cabinet 150.Lord Curzon explained that there were several places, likeMannheim, Strassburg, and Saarbrucken, which could be reachedfrom the Allied lines and bombed with effect, but our aircraft wouldhave to cross the German lines and a region occupied by theirfighting air forces. Mannheim was one of the more suitable places,as it was a munitions centre. He had been shown a communication from our Consul-General at Rotterdam, suggesting Frankfort-on-Main as a good objective, inasmuch as it was a centre of finance andof socialism, and a raid there would have good psychological results.It had to be borne in mind, however, that to be effective such raidswould have to be made in great force, and as the necessary organisa-tion for such had recently been dispersed it would take some months to reassemble its parts. In, the meantime the pilots and machines were fully engaged in short-distance bombing expeditions atZeebrugge, Os^end, Bruges, and along the front.It was pointed out that the suggestion was in reality one of&quot; frightfulness,&quot; and there was some discussion as to whether thiswas desirable. In its favour it could be urged that one of our mainobjects at present was to depress the moral of the German people;the Germans- themselves undertook acts of frightfulness out of amistaken idea of our psychology, which they judged by their own,which would seem to justify air raids. On the other hand, the WarCabinet were reminded that air raids here had not the effect ofdepressing the population, but rather led to a demand for moreenergetic measures on the part of the Government.The War Cabinet decided To postpone a decision on this question until after the nextoffensive on the Western Front, as during the offensive noaeroplanes could be spared.Air raids  asReprisals.
Air Raid onFolkestone.4.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff justified theconcealment, of the names of places bombed by the enemy, on theground that definite information had been received that the Germans,when giving names of places they had bombed, were, in fact, some-times unaware of their position.Transference of enemy Divisions.6.

War, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, in orderto satisfy the Portuguese requirements, one more trip of four ships would he required.Bearing in mind the great importance of placating thePortuguese Government, with a view to a satisfactory arrangement regard to the recruitment of native labour in Portuguese WestAfrica, the War Cabinet felt that there was a strong case for givingthese facilities, if possible.The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff stated that two of theboats had been diverted to the carriage of wheat, and two tothe transport of troops from Salonica.The War Cabinet decided that Before allocating shipping for this purpose, an endeavour shouldbe made by the Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in consultation with the Treasury to obtain thesame result by more generous financial arrangements.Mr. ramsay 21. With   reference   to   the   decision   in War Cabinet  144,Macdonald. Minute 2, that Mr. ramsay Macdonald should be permitted toproceed to Petrograd, Lord Robert Cecil stated that as the resultof the meeting at Leeds on the 3rd June there had been protests from the Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union, the British Workers&apos; League,and in the press against permission being given. It was also mentioned that the question was to be raised in the House of Lords.Another new factor in the situation was the refusal of the FrenchGovernment to permit their Socialists to proceed to Stockholm, thisrefusal being apparently due to internal political pressure on theFrench Government. The Government of the United States ofAmerica were also rather perturbed at our decision to allowrepresentatives of the pacifist element to proceed to Stockholm. Itwas urged that these conferences might have an injurious effect onthe moral of the soldiers (which was said to be General Petain&apos;view), and might force the Allied Governments into a premature and unsatisfactory peace.The view was pressed that we were paying too high a price andrisking too much to support a Government in Russia whose prospectswere at the best very uncertain, and who were probably unlikely toexercise any further influence on the war, and that the WarCabinet should avail themselves of this opportunity to renouncetheir previous decision.On the other hand, it was&quot; pointed out that the effect of a reversal of a decision reached so recently as the 23rd May wouldbe very injurious, not perhaps so much in this country, whereMr. Ramsay Macdonald has comparatively small influence, but inRussia.The decision was felt to turn largely on the question as to whatvalue could be attributed to Russia. In this connection attention was drawn to the figures shown in Minute 6, which prove conclusivelythat the Central Powers feel bound to allot a considerable numberof men and guns to the Eastern Front, which, if transferred to theWestern Front, would seriously alter the balance of forces. It was urged that, even though Russia might be of little value in a militarysense this year, there was at least a possibility that by next year thesituation may have become more settled, and she may become a formidable force, and, in conjunction with the forces of the UnitedStates of America, might enable the Allies to bring the war to a successful issue.It was pointed out that, if Mr. Ramsay Macdonald went to stockholm and adopted a German point of view, he would be absoulutely discredited in this country. On the other hand, if headopted the Allied point of view about Alsace-Lorraine, the Germans

On the other hand, if headopted the Allied point of view about Alsace-Lorraine, the Germans
would see that even extreme socialistic opinion was against them.In either case we should stand to gain.In this connection Lord Robert Cecil read a letter fromMr. Ramsay Macdonald.It was also urged that to reverse the previous decision in regardto Mr. Ramsay Macdonald would have the effect of rallying a gooddeal of sympathy to him, and giving his visit a fictitious importanceout of all proportion to the reality.The War Cabinet were of opinion that Before reversing their previous decision, it was indispensable toobtain Mr. Henderson&apos;s views, since he might have beenbasing his conversations with the Russian Government onthe assumption that Mr. Ramsay Macdonald would beallowed to proceed.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook tosend a telegram to Mr. Henderson recapitulating the new factors and inviting his views.Propaganda inGreat Britainagainst PeaceCampaign.22. The War Cabinet felt that the time had come to undertakean active campaign to counteract the pacifist movement, which atpresent had the field to itself.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 5, 1917.o
