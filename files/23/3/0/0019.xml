Secretary.Prime MinistersforthcomingSpeeches inScotland.[1365-THE War Cabinet discussed the general lines of the PrimeMinister&apos;s forthcoming speeches in Scotland. It was recognised thatthese speeches would be very anxiously scrutinised, not only in thiscountry, but in enemy, Allied, and neutral countries. It was very important, therefore, that the statements should represent the considered policy of the Government.The following points in the speech were agreed to : In regard to the Russian formula of peace with no annexationsand indemnities, it would be pointed out that Mesopotamia had never been Turkish ; that its ultimate disposal would, therefore, beleft to the Peace Conference; but that it could never be returned to turkey, since that country had never been more than a trustee forits well-being, and had grossly abused the trust. The same appliedto Armenia. German East Africa wrould also have to be left for decision by the Peace Conference, but it should be pointed out thatthis colony had never been populated by Germans, and that theinhabitants ought to be consulted as to whether they preferredBritish or German rule. It was agreed that no allusion should bemade to Palestine, as this country is not in our occupation. It waspointed out that the wording of this part of the Prime Ministersspeech must be carefully guarded, in order not to compromise theprospects of France in Alsace and Lorraine, since it was possible thata plebiscite of the actual population might give a German majority,owing to the fact that the Germans had settled large numbers oftheir nationals in these provinces.In regard to the development of Democratic Government inGermany, it should be pointed out that this is a matter primarily for the Germans themselves, in which we do not expect to be able to dictate. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the fact ofGermany adopting a democratic constitution would provide one ofthe guarantees for peace which we sought. We should enter intoa conference with greater confidence if we were dealing with a democratic Government. It was essential, however, that it shouldbe a real and not a sham democracy.In regard to food, it was agreed that the Prime Minister should announce that the Government recognise that, in order to keep up-171]
the moral of the nation, it was necessary, not only to have sufficientfood, but ample food at reasonable prices. This policy of cheapeningthe essentials of life would he carried out, partly by measures toprevent profiteering, and, so far as necessary, by an artificialreduction of the price of food at the cost of the Exchequer. this latter course was necessary for the reason that, in the case of imported food, the cost of production was outside government control. This policy had been pursued in France, where they are actually spending 36,000..OOOZ. sterling annually for the purpose. Itwas agreed, however, that in order not to compromise Lord Rhondda&apos;s negotiations, care should be exercised not to mention any particularfigure. It was also decided that the artificial lowering of prices should be confined to absolute essentials, such as bread, meat, and sugar.It was agreed that the Prime Minister should include words ofencouragement to Russia, since the War Cabinet recognised that russia still remains a very important factor in the Alliance.It was pointed out that fiussia has not been very well treated by our Press, who had been critical and none too friendly. ThePrime Minister proposed to take the line that the Russian revolu-tion had unquestionably postponed the date of the Allies&apos; victory,but had improved the quality of that victory. He also proposed toask what would have happened to the Russian revolution if theWestern Allies had not, been in a position to sustain the brunt ofthe war single-handed. While the new democracy in the East was seeking to establish itself, the old democracy in the West wouldhave been overthrown.It was also agreed that the Prime Minister should speak in encouraging terms of France, Italy (as requested by the italian ambassador), and other Allies.In regard to the submarine campaign, the Prime minister proposed to take the high line, and to give the impression that,while not underrating its severity, it could never force us to makepeace. The Prime Minister said he would state definitely that wecould continue the war until the harvest of 1918. His object intaking this line v as to discourage, the Germans as much as possible.This gave rise to some discussion on the shipping situation, and thePrime Minister read a letter he had received from Sir JosephMaclay containing some serious figures. The Secretary gave a shortaccount of a conversation he had had that afternoon wdth Sir NormanHill, who had explained to him that the shipping community were much disturbed at the heavy losses taking place in the zones of concentration of homeward-bound merchant shipping on the atlantic route, and had illustrated his remarks statistically on a chart.In regard to shipbuilding, it was agreed the Prime minister should make an appeal to the shipbuilding community of Glasgowand should joint out to them that their own food depended to someextent upon their exertions.It wcas agreed that the Prime Minister should make an appeal for public opinion to keep steady, and more particularly to the Pressnot to rattle public opinion. In this connection the Prime minister proposed to point out that our armies could not be beaten, andthat public opinion behind those armies must be equally reliable.It was agreed that, if possible, the Prime Minister should avoid any illusion to the beer controversy.In regard to industrial unrest, it was agreed that the PrimeMinister should thank the people for the way in which they had maintained the level of output, notwithstanding three years ofincessant unrest. In this connection the Prime Minister proposed,with general agreement, to allude to the example of strenuous workset to his people by The King.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 28, 1917.
