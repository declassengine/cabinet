THE War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on aMemorandum prepared at their request by the Director of recruiting.It was pointed out that the proposals involved the transfer of recruiting for the Army to a civilian organisation, and it was decidedthat this should be done.It was therefore necessary to decide whether this organisation should be set up in a new Department or placed under an existingDepartment. It was not deemed desirable to create a new department, and it was therefore for consideration whether the recruiting organisation should be embodied in (a.) The Local Government Board,(b.) The National Service Department,(c.) The Ministry of Labour.[1365-201]
. A further question arises as to whether recruiting for ship-building should be under the National Service Department or theLabour Ministry.It was also pointed out that, in the War Cabinet programme of questions awaiting consideration for the current week, there are nineitems dealing with Man-Power.The War Cabinet decided that a Committee composed ofLord Milner,General Smuts, andMr. Barnes,should be formed, who should have full and final powers,on behalf of the War Cabinet, to decide, in consultationwith the Departments concerned, all questions of recruiting and Man-Power, and report their decisions to the WarCabinet.Tonnage forConveyance of horses.2..
