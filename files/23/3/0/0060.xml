Swinton, C.B., D.S.O., Assistant Secretary.The stockholm conference.Mr. arthur henderson&apos;resignation.Letter from thePrime Minister toMr. Henderson.1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 211, the War Cabinetcontinued their discussion on the situation created by the LabourParty&apos;s vote in favour of representation at the Stockholm Conference.Two new factors had arisen since the previous evening:(1) Mr. Henderson had tendered his resignation, and at thesame time had informed the Prime Minister that he continued to share his desire that the War should be carried to a successful con-clusion, and trusted that in a non-Government capacity he might beable to render some little assistance to this end. [During the meeting,the Prime Minister received information that His Majesty the king had given his permission for the acceptance of Mr. Henderson&apos;resignation.] (2) M. Nabokoff, the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires, had given the Prime Minister full authority to include in a publishedletter the Russian Government^ communication in regard to the stockholm Conference (War Cabinet 210, Minute 12), as well asanything mentioned in his letter of the 8th August (No. 1328), solong as his name was not mentioned.There was some discussion as to whether, after Mr. Henderson&apos;resignation, it would be advisable for the Prime Minister to send theproposed letter to Mr. Henderson, as decided the previous day (WarCabinet 211, Minute 3). It was suggested that there was noprecedent for such action ; that it was important, particularly inview of Mr. Henderson&apos;s offer of continued assistance, not to make a wider breach with him than could be avoided ; and that it might bebetter to confine action to a statement in the House of Commons.
Against this it was urged that no time ought to be lost in makingpublic in some form, the two points mentioned in War Cabinet 211,Minute 3. During the discussion on this point, information wasreceived that Mr. Henderson, in view of the suggestions of bad faithon his part which had been made in the morning papers, was himselfpreparing a statement for publication, and that he proposed to make *use of certain official telegrams.The War Cabinet took note, however, the consent of HisMajesty the King, obtained through a Secretary of State, would benecessary before Mr. Henderson could make public official documents,and decided that The situation would best be met by re-drafting the proposedletter from the Prime Minister&apos;to Mr. Henderson, and thatit should be somewhat modified in tone. Apart fromchanges in form, the main alteration in substance in theoriginal draft was the inclusion .pf an acknowledgment ofMr. Henderson&apos;s offer of assistance. The letter, as finally approved by the War Cabinet, is printed in the Appendix.Publication.2. In regard to publication, the War Cabinet agreed that The correspondence should be published in Sunday&apos;s newspapers(Sunday, 14th August), Mr. Henderson being informed of this.The Prime Ministers Private Secretary to take the necessary action.The Political 3. It was generally agreed that the action of the Labour PartySituation. was likely to damage this country in the eyes of foreign Powers, whowould say that British democracy had by its vote shown itself tiredof the war, and that it would also be a serious blow to the Govern-ment. The view was expressed, however, that the situation might very likely be retrieved at the Trades Union Congress to be held.onthe 3rd September, by which time the facts given in the PrimeMinisters letter would have become generally known. It was also pointed out that the effect of an important success by our arms in flanders during the current offensive would have a most beneficial effect on democratic opinion.In this connection it was suggested that one way of meeting thesituation might be that the Labour representatives in the Governmentshould go to their constituencies, which action would be tantamount to a miniature General Election, asking for a vote of confidence in theGovernment. The objections to this course appeared to be that itwould be looked upon as a farce, as merely an effort of the Govern-ment to obtain a majority, and as being a partial appeal to theLabour Party and not to the country at large.To meet the latter objection it was suggested that a GeneralElection should be held immediately, without waiting for the newRegister, in order that the direct authority of the whole country might be behind the Government in their future conduct of the war.But it was urged against this course that women would bediscontented if they had no vote, and would regard themselves asbeing betrayed by the \ Government, and that the consequence of an election at the present moment might, in two years&apos; time, be a reaction in the other direction.It was also brought to the notice of the W&quot;ar Cabinet that thepresent moment, which was one of really critical importance, whenproposals for peace had actually been made by the Pope, and other proposals of. a plausible nature but tending towards an unsatisfactorypeace were in the air, was most inopportune for a General -Election,and that it would cause difficulties with our Allies.
After consideration of these points it was decided that The question of having a General or partial Election should befurther considered at a convenient moment, after time hadbeen allowed for the opinion of the country to be fullyeducated, as to the real situation in regard to the stockholm conference, by the information made public in the PrimeMinister&apos;s letter to Mr. Henderson.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 11, 1917.
My dear Henderson, August 11, 1917.I AM in receipt of your letter of this morning, tendering your resignation of yourposition as a member of the War Cabinet, and have received the permission of HisMajesty, to whom I submitted your resignation, to accept it. My colleagues andI have received with satisfaction the assurance of your unabated desire to assist in thepi-osecution of the war to a successful conclusion, and they greatly regret that you 5anno longer be directly and officially associated with them in that enterprise. There are,however, certain facts with which it is essential that the public should be acquainted inorder that they may form a correct appreciation of the events that have led to thisregrettable conclusion.The first is that your colleagues were taken completely by surprise by the attitude which you adopted at the Labour Conference yesterday afternoon. You knew thatthey were, in the present circumstances, unanimously opposed to the stockholm conference, and you had yourself been prepared to agree to an announcement to that effect some days ago. At your suggestion, however, and that of your Labour colleagues,it was decided to defer any such announcement until after the meeting yesterday.I was under the impression, after several talks with you, that you meant to use yourinfluence against meeting enemy representatives at Stockholm. What has happened in Russia during the last few weeks has materially affected the position in referenceto that Conference. You admitted to me that the situation had completely changedeven within the last fortnight, and that whatever ground you might have thought there was for delegates from Allied countries attending such a Conference a fortnightago, the events of the last few days had shown you the unwisdom of such a course.That was clearly what you led me to believe ; it was also the impression left on the minds of your colleagues in the Cabinet and of your Labotir colleagues in the Ministry.It was therefore with no small surprise that I received a letter from you yesterdayafternoon stating that you &quot;ought to inform me that after the most careful considera-tion you had come to the conclusion you could take no other course than to stand bythe advice you had given the day after your return from Russia,&quot; and that your colleagues subsequently read the speech which you had delivered.Surely this was a conclusion of which you ought to have informed the cabinet before you entered the Conference. When you spoke at that Conference you were notmerely a member of the Labour Party, but a member of the Cabinet, responsible forthe conduct of the. War. Nevertheless, you did not deem it necessary to inform theConference of the views of your colleagues, and the delegates accordingly were justifiedin assuming that the advice you gave wras not inconsistent with their opinions&apos;.The second point is this. Yesterday morning we received a most&quot; importantcommunication from the Russian Government, in which we were informed that&quot; although the Russian Government did. not deem it possible to prevent Russiandelegates from taking part in the Stockholm Conference, they regarded it as a Partjrconcern and its decisions as in no wise binding on the liberty of action of theGovernment.&quot; And further the covering letter which accompanied this communicationcontained these words : &quot; I hasten today before you the above information, as I fear that the impression has hitherto prevailed that, in the words of one of the Londonnewspapers, &apos; Russia ardently desired the Stockholm Conference,&apos;and this argumenthas been put forward in order to influence British public opinion in favour of theLabour and Socialist parties of Great Britain participating in the Conference.&quot;Immediately on receipt of this intimation, I sent it over to you with a request that you should comniunicate it to the Conference. You omitted to do so. It is truethat in the course of your speech you made a very casual reference to &quot;some modification &quot; in the attitude of the Russian Government; but there is a manifestdifference between the effect which would necessarily be produced upon any audienceby an indifferent summary of that description and the communication to them of official information showing that the attitude of the Russian Government towardsthe Stockholm Conference Avas very different from what had been supposed.In these circumstance, your action does not appear to have been fair either to theGovernment or to the delegates whom you were addressing.    They were left inignorance of a vital fact which must necessarily have affected their judgment.I am sending a copy of this correspondence to the press.Yours sincerely,(Signed) D. LLOYD GEORGE.The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P.APPENDIX.
