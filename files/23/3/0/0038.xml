LORD MILNER reported the result of the ConferencesFood Distribution. this week . on Food Prices and Food Distribution, at therequest of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 188, Minute 11), withrepresentatives of the War Office, the Boards of Agriculture, theBoard of Trade, and the Ministry of Food. It had been unanimously agreed to recommend, for the approval of the War Cabinet, thefollowing scale of maximum prices for live cattle for the Army: Per Live Cwt.September 1917     ... ... ...      74s.October    ... ... ... ...       72s.November and December      ... ...       67s.From 1st January, 1918       ... ...       60s.(These prices compared  with a price of about 87s. at thepresent time).It had also been unanimously agreed to recommend, for the approvalof the War Cabinet, that the mean price of British wheat purchased[1365-190] B
by the Food Controller shordd be 72s. per 480 lb., and that theprice of the quartern loaf should be 9d., the prices of barley andoats to be on a parity with the price of wheat.Lord Milner stated that this agreement had been reached afterprolonged consideration. There would no doubt be protests Joy the farmers, especially by those who had bought store cattle at high prices, but the figures fixed for September and October made, in hisopinion, sufficient allowance for difficulties of this class. The loss to the Treasury on the wheat purchases was estimated by the FoodController to be roughly as follows : 28,000,000 quarters of imported wheat bought at 83s. andsupplied to the millers at 62s. would involve a loss of29,500,000Z.7,000,000 quarters of British wheat bought at 72s., supplied tothe millers at 62s., would involve a loss of 3,500,0001.The total loss was thus estimated at about 33,000,000Z. ; but he(Lord Milner) thought that, in view of possible economies of highermilling and dilution, the estimate was much too high. His ownestimate was that the loss would not greatly exceed 25,00O,00OZ.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that the farmers were, for various reasons, undergoing a severer strain than was generally realised, but he agreed that the proposed dates and suggested meat prices gave them a fair chance of disposing of theircattle.In coming to a decision, the War Cabinet were influenced bythe recent reports of the Commissioners on Industrial Unrest, whoattributed much of the prevailing unrest directly to high food prices. Demands for increased wages were constantly being made,and strikes were frequent. For the vigorous prosecution of thewar a contented working class was indispensable. There were large districts where the cost of living had increased far out of proportion to the advances in wages. In France bread was being supplied at Sd., at a cost to the Government of 37,000,000LThe Chancellor of the Exchequer strongly represented to theWar Cabinet the serious inroad on the Treasury which the wheatproposals involved. It would be very difficult to justify them tothe&apos; House of Commons. The estimated loss would be much larger than the additional taxation- put on this year, and it wouldhave to be borne by classes already severely handicapped by war-taxation.   He wished to express his dissent from the proposals.The Food Controller explained that his scheme embraced notonly the reduction in the wholesale prices of bread and meat, butthe setting up of machinery to control the middlemen, and, withthe aid of the local authorities, to secure that the reductionsreached the consumers. He proposed, for instance, to licensewholesale meat dealers and butchers, who, on the basis of a reason-able profit, would sell at not more than a price fixed by the FoodController, the price to he adjusted to the varying customs ofdifferent localities. The meat prices would come into operation onthe 1st September, and he fully recognised the importance of anearly announcement with regard to bread.Lord^Rhondda undertook to make this announcement at theearliest possible date, and to bring the reduction of priceinto operation not later than the middle of August.The War Cabinet approved the recommendations of the conferences as reported above by Lord Milner.Liquor restriction: 2. The War Cabinet briefly considered the present provision ofSupply of Harvest beer, especially in rural areas, and Lord Rhondda undertook to seeBeer. whether brewing facilities could be extended without the issue of aspecial order.
Imperial &quot;WarCabinetDocuments :Question of sending to Australia.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration certain telegrams which had passed between the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Governor-General of Australia, as the result of their decision on the 22nd May, 1917 (Paper G.T.-1356.   Appendix I).The War Cabinet decided that &quot;The Secretary of State for the Colonies should make thenecessary arrangements for the safe transmission of a set of Papers, identical with that supplied for record to thevarious Prime Ministers of the Overseas Dominions whohad attended the Imperial War Cabinet meetings earlier in the year, to the Prime Minister of the AustralianCommonwealth.Requirements of oil Fuel and ships in the UnitedStates of America.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum preparedby the Controller of the Navy and the Fourth Sea Lord (paper g.T.-1433), stating that it was understood that an Inter-AllyConference wras to meet in London to arrange the quantities of all supplies of w-ar material to be obtained by the Allies from theUnited States of America, and submitting that, for the reasons give in the Memorandum, oil fuel and ships of all kinds should be excluded from the list of these supplies, the Admiralty being allowed to retain its present responsibility for the provision of thesaid supplies from that country.It was pointed out, in regard to the above Conference, that nothing had yet been settled as to its powers, constitution, or placeof meeting ; that the views of the United States Government onthis question had not yet been communicated to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment ; and that, in the circumstances, any discussion of thesubject with a view to a definite decision was premature.The War Cabinet agreed that Pending a decision as to the constitution, powers, and habitatof the Conference, the present arrangements, under whichthe Admiralty control the provision of oil-fuel and ships from the United States, should continue.The Eastern Front. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff commtmicated to theWar Cabinet the latest information regarding the present offensive operations by the Russians in various sections of their front, and his view as to the measure of success that might accrue in each case.General Robertson stated that two German divisions from theWestern front, and two and a half divisions from the Italian front had lately been withdrawn in order to check the Russian advance.So far as his information went, the enemy had now only sevendivisions on the Eastern front in reserve on a line which extended for 900 miles. In regard to the Southern sector of the russian front, he briefly outlined what he understood to be the intentions of General Brusiloff in regard to a possible offensive in that quarter.The Western Front. 6. The Chief of the Imperial G eneral Staff said that on theWestern front the enemy had now three fewer divisions than theyhad throe months ago. The total number of AUiecl divisions on this front was 180, as compared with 153 enemy divisions.Palestine. 7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had prepared a note regarding the recent telegram from general allenby respecting requirements for a campaign in Palestine,which he undertook to circulate to the War Cabinet that afternoon.
Paris Conference.mercantile shipping Losses.Enemy Seaplanes.Atlantic Convoys.8. The War Cabinet briefly considered certain questions whichwere to come up for discussion at the forthcoming Conference at paris. They agreed that the presence of General Cadorna at theConference was desirable, and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff undertook to inforrn General Cadorna accordingly.9. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff gave details as to themost recent losses.The War Cabinet, after a review of the losses during the past month, agreed that the situation was, relative to anticipation, not unsatisfactory.10. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that enemyseaplanes had recently bombarded Stavros, without causing any damage.11. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff stated that a convoy of24 ships from the United States had reached British shores intact ;that another large convoy was due in the course of the present week ;and that six convoys were now on the Atlantic.Ireland: TheQuestion of a referendum.Weekly Reports.12. In view of the agitation in certain quarters in Ireland forthe submission of the conclusions of the Irish Convention to a referendum before any legislative action is taken (see Memorandumby Mr. Duke, G.T.-1446) (Appendix II), and of a question to that effect which Lord Dunraven was putting in the House of Lords, the WarCabinet considered that it would be a great pity that theGovernment should not be free to give legislative effect to a schemewhich secured the agreement of all moderate sections in Ireland,and should be compelled to submit it to a Referendum, where itwould be almost certain to be rejected.The War Cabinet requested Lord Curzon to reply to the question to the effect that therewas no intention, on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government,to take advantage of the Convention in order to force uponIreland conclusions which would get the Government out ofits immediate difficulty. The Government had askedIreland to formulate its own plan, and the understanding-was that if there was a reasonable degree of unanimity inthe conclusions arrived at by the Convention, and if therewas good ground for believing that they would meet withthe general support of the Irish people, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would take steps to give them legislativeeffect.13. The War Cabinet, in continuation of the instructions givento the Chief Secretary for Ireland (War Cabinet 186, Minute 1),decided that A weekly report on the state of Ireland should be submitted tothem by the Chief Secretary.Interview with 14. With reference to War Cabinet 187, Minute 9, the PrimePress Representa- Minister informed the War Cabinet that he had granted an interviewtlves&apos; on the 17th instant to certain editors of leading newspapers, that hehad explained to them quite frankly and in strict confidence the exact position of affairs, and that he had reason to hope thatthe interview, which was of a very satisfactory nature, would bejustified by results.
The MerchantShipbuildingProgramme.15. With, reference to War Cabinet 181, Minute 1, Lord Curzonstated that he had commenced, but been unable to continue, the meetings of the Committee of which he was Chairman Owing to the changes in the three Ministers who were associated with him on theCommittee. He proposed to sit again on the following Monday,when he hoped that all the members would be present, and hewould report progress to the War Cabinet with the least possible delay.Committee onAerial Operations.Leakage of OfficialMatter.16. With reference to War Cabinet 181, Minute 2, the WarCabinet considered the first Report of the Committee (paper g.T.-1451), submitting the recommendations of the committee regarding the measures which, in their opinion, should be adopted to improve the present arrangements for the defence of the london area against hostile air raids.The War Cabinet approved the recommendations of the Com-mittee, and instructed the Secretary to take the necessary steps to ensure immediate effect being given to the same.17. The War Cabinet took note of a representation which wasmade to them to the effect that an article which had appeared inthat morning&apos;s issue of &quot; The Daily Chronicle &quot; indicated that therehad been an unauthorised disclosure to the above paper of informa-tion of a confidential nature, relating to the National service department.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 19, 1917.[1365-190]C
APPENDIX I.G.T.-1356. -Issue oe Imperial War Cabinet Documents to the Prime Minister of theCommonwealth of Australia.(Copies of Telegrams to and from Secretary of State for the Colonies and theGovernor-General of Australia, and War Cabinet Minute.)I.Governor-General of Australia to Secretary of State for Colonies, July 6, 1917.Your cypher telegram of 23rd May regarding circulation among the members ofBritish War Cabinet of most secret documents, my Prime Minister does not anticipatevisiting England at present. He suggests that Imperial Authorities should decidemethod of forwarding documents to Australia. Munro Ferguson.II.Secretary of State for Colonies to Governor-General of Australia, May 23, 1917.A number of documents of great importance and of the most secret character werecirculated to members of the Imperial War Cabinet. His Majesty&apos;s Government feelthat your Prime Minister ought to have cognisance of these papers, and are preparedto send a set of them if he so desires ; but we are greatly impressed by the danger of sending such documents across the sea in present circumstances when raiders are at large-should they fall into enemy&apos;s hands the consequences would be serious. Weshould therefore prefer if there is any chance of Mr. Hughes coming to England toretain the papers here till he arrives.   Please inform me of his wishes. Long.III.Extract from Meeting of War Cabinet 142, May 22, 1917.13. The War Cabinet discussed the question of communicatingImperial War Cabinet documents to the Prime Minister of theAustralian Commonwealth (Paper G.T.-741) (Appendix III).The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that theother Prime Ministers had each taken away a set of the paperssupplied to them during the Session of the Imperial War Cabinet,taking special precautions for their destruction in case of emergency.Mr. Hughes was therefore in a position, relative to the other PrimeMinisters, of complete ignorance as to the Imperial situation,as it had been before&apos; those Ministers. This might possibly beawkward if Mr. Massey visited Mr, Hughes on his return journeyand spoke about matters with regard to which Mr. Hughes was leftuninformed. If Mr. Hughes were coming over soon he could seethe papers here, but his plans were uncertain, and if he were notcoming over he might be offended if he did not receive the papers.The Secretary of State for the Colonies had some doubts whether a prime Minister who was absent from the Cabinet Session shouldhave the papers circulated to him, and, in view of the fact that theImperial Cabinet was being established as a permanent institution,that point would have to be considered. After some hesitation, inview of the possible risks run, he had been prepared to suggestsending the documents out in charge of a special messenger.A.general discussion followed, chiefly as to the extent of riskincurred in sending the documents oversea.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary of State for the Colonies to send a telegram tothe Prime Minister  of  the  Australian  CommonwealthImperial WarCabinetDocuments:The Question of sending toAustralia.
expressing the view of the War Cabinet that he ought tosee the documents in question, but laying stress on the considerable risk involved in sending them to Australia,and suggesting that, if he were thinking of coming overto this country in the near future, the documents might bekept here pending his arrival.APPENDIX II.G.T.-1446. -Irish Convention.Note by Mr. Duke.THE announcements made in the course of the last few days with regard to theconstitution of and arrangements for the Irish Convention appear to have considerablyrevived public interest in this undertaking. Such information as I have been able toobtain leads me to think that the Extremists in Ireland are by no means content withtheir present position in the matter, and may even yet desire to gain admission forsome of their spokesmen at the sittings of the Convention. It appears, therefore, tohave been a wise decision by which the question of representation of the 0&apos;Brien andSinn Fein interests was left open until the Convention meets.Among a very large portion of the active politicians in Ireland there is an urgentdemand that the Government should make some announcement which will secure themagainst being committed by the proceedings of the Convention to some Irish settlemontwhich might be rushed through the two Houses of Parliament and passed into law,although in fact it might not be a settlement satisfactory to a majority of the Irishelectorate. This wish takes the form generally of a demand for a referendum ademand which has been systematically presented day by day for some weeks in theeditorial columns of the &quot;Irish Independent,&quot; the most widely circtdated of the Irishnewspapers.The reasons against the announcement of a referendum upon any proposed Irishsettlement are, to my mind, obvious, and I know7 that some of the advocates of areferendmn recognise the force of these reasons. I think, however, it would probablyfacilitate the work of the Convention to a great extent if at the earliest time possible,an announcement could be authoritatively made in Parliament which wTould present a safe guard to those representatives of Irish opinion who, I think, honestly fear anattempt at a sudden settlement by agreement of the Convention and consequentlegislation without any reasonable certainty that the settlement would command thesupport or acquiescence of the masses of the Irish people. I hope it may he found possible to make such a statement as I have indicated in the course of the present week.(Initialled) H. E. D.July 11, 1917.
