The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the Russianfor Eussia. representatives in London had been pressing the War Office to expedite the carrying out of the programme for the supply of war material toRussia, and he felt that it was no longer possible to continue delaying the despatch of guns without a full explanation being given of thecircumstances causing the delay. He suggested, therefore, that thePrime Minister, or some member of the War Cabinet, should see theRussian representatives and explain the exact position.In regard to the original programme for guns, the Master-General of the Ordnance stated that the situation was as follows : 	Total Promised.	Total Sent.	Balance Owing.9&apos;2-inch howitzers 6     ,,         ,, 60-pr. guns	20 48 100 52	5 s 88 52	15 40 12 * *these numbers of guns being apart from the programme recommendedby Lord Milner.In regard to 9&apos;2-inch and 8-inch howitzers, he explained thatthere was a constant demand for replacement of worn weapons fromthe British Expeditionary Force, and that for some time past it had only been possible merely to maintain the number of pieces inFrance.The War Cabinet felt that, in view of our own necessities, theyshould ascertain, in the first instance, whether there was any reasonable prospect of the guns supplied by us to the Russians being used against the enemy. In order to obtain this information, theWar Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should obtain the viewsof Generals Poole and Knox on the following points : (a.) Whether the guns already sent to Russia werebeing used, and to what extent;(6.) What further number it was recommended shouldbe sent out.Salonica. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that allthe reports received from the Allied Commanders on the spot andfrom. independent sources pointed to the fact that General Sarrail&apos;shandling of the recent offensive at Salonica had not been good, and
Italy and Albania. 6. The War Cabinet had under consideration telegram No. 488,dated the 4th June, 1917, from the British Ambassador at Borne,notifying and explaining the Proclamation by the ItalianGovernment of an Italian Protectorate of Albania.The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was authorised to inform the Italian Foreign Minister that this event had created a painful impression.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 6, 1917.that the consensus of opinion was that he concerned himself morewith the political aspect of the campaign than with the actualconduct of military operations. This was not only the opinion ofthe British, Italian, Russian, and Serbian Commanders on the spot,but, according to confidential reports, was the view held by some ofthe French Generals themselves.From the information received it was evident to the WarCabinet that, whatever instructions he might receive from theFrench Government, General Sarrail could not be relied on to carryout the occupation of Thessaly and the Allied policy in Greece in a conciliatory manner ; and attention was drawn to the fact thatapprehensions were felt by the Serbians that General Sarrail, inorder to carry out his operations in Thessaly, was weakening theAllied line in Macedonia so much as to create a dangerous militarysituation.The War Cabinet felt that, in view of the reports they hadreceived, they would be neglecting their duty to the British andother forces at Salonica if they did not make immediate representa-tions on the subject of the Command to the French Government.The Prime Minister undertook to write, on behalf of the WarCabinet, to M. Bibot, to express its unanimous view thatGeneral Sarrail should be replaced in the command of theAllied forces at Salonica.It was further decided that The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should makea confidential communication in this sense to the italian foreign Minister.
