With reference to War Cabinet 169, Minute 6, the Chief of theImperial General Staff reported that the Germans had brought up two divisions from other parts of the front to the point where the russians had made their first attack. The attack near Stanislau, reported in.the newspapers, had been a very successful affair. The infantry had broken through on an 11-mile front, and had advanced four miles.Three Cavalry Divisions had advanced 8 miles, and should have passed through all obstacles. The advance was on a good line along a railway.The opposition hitherto had been entirely by Austrian troops.Now, however, a German Division had been brought up to reinforce.Serbian Troops. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the desire of the Serbians to bring to Salonica the two Divisions now inBessarabia. The Russian Commander on the Roumanian front,however, strongly opposed their withdrawal, and said his men would refuse to advance if it took place.M. Painleve&apos;forthcoming visit to London.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that,according to his private information, M. Painleve&apos;s forthcoming visit to London Avas in connection with the demand for theremoval of General Sarrail. There was some discussion on thisquestion, and no reasons were ui-ged to justify a reversal of thedecision of War Cabinet 155, Minute 5, and War Cabinet 156,Appendix.The Western Front. 5. It was agreed that M. Painleve should be pressed on thesubject of the French offensive intentions on the Western Front.The Air said.6. With reference to War Cabinet 179, Minute S (a), the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff reported that the squadron of fightingaeroplanes recalled from France had not yet been despatched.General Trenchard had reported that, owing to bad weather con-ditions, he could not send the squadron without risk, and the WarCabinet approved that risks should not be taken.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig had telegraphed to thank the War Cabinet fortheir decision of the 9th July (War Cabinet 179, Minute 8) that thesecond squadron should not be withdrawn, which, he said, would help him considerably. He had also intimated his intention to make preparations for the attack on Mannheim at a later date, when theold type of machines have been replaced.Views of theField-marshal commanding-in-Chief Home Forces.7. With reference to War Cabinet 179, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff made a personal explanation on thesubject of Lord Frenches letter of the 2nd instant, which had notbeen seen by either himself or the Secretary of State for War untilyesterday. He had taken the responsibility of sending back thetwo squadrons to the Western Front, but only after he had firstascertained that other machines had been allotted to Home Defence.He had also taken into consideration the fact that it had beendecided to send the squadrons back on the 5th July, and that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was badly in need of them and had telegraphed asking for them on that date.

The First Sea Lord reported that the Dreadnought battleship&quot; Vanguard.&quot; &quot; Vanguard &quot; had been blown up on the previous night while atanchor.

With   reference   to   War   Cabinet   144, Minute   9,   theTroubridge. Secretary reported that he had received a communication from admiral Troubridge, who had been recalled to England in orderto bring information from the  Serbian  Government.     AdmiralTroubridge was anxious now to return to Serbia.The War Cabinet decided that * Admiral Troubridge should be interviewed by Lord Milner andGeneral Smuts.Inter-Allied 14. The War Cabinet decided that 1 &apos; &apos; There was-no objection to the postponement of the Inter-Allied Conference, as proposed by the Italian Government.There is some obscurity at present as to the precise date.Proposed Inter-national ShippingConference.15. With reference to Paper I.C.-22, paragraph 7, with regardto a conference of shipping experts of France, Great Britain, andItaly, upon the subject of the tornage situation at Salonica, the WarCabinet decided that The Shipping Controller, in concert with the Frst Sea Lord,should convene a conference for the purpose indicated inthe above Paper.8. With reference to War Cabinet 162, Minute 15, the first sea Lord reported a second attack on the Atlantic convoy inthe course of which the destroyer &quot; Ettrick&quot; was torpedoed;forty-eight men were killed, and the bows were blown off the ship,but what was left of the destroyer had been towed into port.
Shipping Losses.16. The attention, of the War Cabinet was drawn to the heavy losses of merchant ships, amounting to over 22,000 gross tons, onthe previous day. The First Sea Lord stated that none of these losses had been in Atlantic convoys, though a ship had been sunk inthe Scandinavian convoy. *The First Sea Lord stated that there, were not sufficientdestroyers available for more frequent convoys, and his difficultiesin this respect were about to be increased by the fact that theUnited States of America intended to concentrate all their torpedocraft on escorting their transports.The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the Memo-randum by Sir Norman Hill (Paper G.T.-1130), the Admiralty&apos;reply (Paper G.T.-1273), and Sir Norman HiH&apos;s rejoinder (paper g.T.-1308), on the subject of the control of merchant shipping.The War Cabinet decided To investigate the question fully with representative shipowners,in the presence of representatives of the Admiralty andthe Shipping Controller.The Secretary Avas instructed to arrange with the ShippingController for the presence of shipowners representativenot merely of one, but of the several schools of thought.Public &quot;Warningsof Air raids .The mesopotamia commission:disciplinary action.17. As the result of the experience gained in the Air Raid on london on the 7th July, 1917, when many lives were saved by thefact that in certain cases private warning had been given, the WarCabinet modified their decision taken on the 26th June, 1917 (WarCabinet, 169, Minute 4), and authorised The Home Secretary to work out and put into operation asystem of warnings to be given, where possible, immediately before a raid takes place, when the course followed by theraiders left practically no doubt as to their destination orobjective.18. The &quot;War Cabinet considered the Report of the ArmyCouncil (Paper G.T.-1327 a, Appendix I), prepared at their requestMinute 2), which, was supplementedAdvocate-General (Paper G.T.-Judgeby a1337,(War  Cabinet, 175,Memorandum by theAppendix II).The Judge Advocate-General pointed out that a Court of inquiry would, in all probability, serve the purposes of the case,as, judging on the evidence already put forward, the Arrrry council could, on the Report of the Court of Inquiry, recommend His majesty o remove or dismiss an officer from the service^ which was. substan- ^tially the same as the maximum punishment^ dould7inflicfr/ifor any of jthe offences with which it was possible to charge the officers con- ^V&apos;cerned. A Court of Inquiry would be far more expeditious in itsworkings, and it would obviate the necessity of taking the evidencetwice over first, for the purposes of the Summary, and, second, forthe purposes of the trial. Moreover, it would give the military officers concerned an opportunity of clearing their professional reputationswhen any reflections had been cast on them. He added, that it wouldbe right that the people whose conduct was under considerationby the Court of Inquiry should have the opportunity of being repre-sented by Counsel, and that the evidence wotdd be taken on oath.In the event of it being decided to try these officers by Court-Martial&quot;after the Court of Inquiry, it wotdd be necessary to pass a lawdeferring the operations of the Statute of Limitations.The War Cabinet held the view that it was essential that a highly competent tribunal should be assembled as a Court of inquiry, and it was pointed out that, as most of the military officers of sufficient rank and otherwise suitable to compose a Courtwere already employed in connection with the war, it was desirable
that the Court should be partly formed of judges and partly ofgeneral officers. In this connection it appeared that the Army Act,as amended by the Army (Courts of Inquiry) Act of 1916, authorisesthe appointment of civilians on a Court of Inquiry in any matters in which the conduct of other civilians is concerned ; and it wasconsidered that, as any inquiry into, and any review of, the conductof the military officers referred to in the Report of the mesopotamia commission must necessarily involve a consideration of the conductof the civilians referred to in that Report, the Cabinet would be fully-justified in making use of the provisions of the Army (courts of Inquiry) Act of 1916 in appointing judges on the inquiry; andthat, as the Court so constituted could make an adverse report onthe actions of civilians in the same manner as they might makea report of that character against the actions of the military, thatfact would be sufficient justification to Parliament. &apos;The Adjutant-General pointed out that it was necessary thatthere should be three military officers on the Court, namely, ageneral officer with a good knowledge of home administration,a general officer with a special knowledge of India, and a seniormedical officer.The War Cabinet decided that The Court should be formed under the provisions of the Army(Courts of Inquiry) Act, 1916, and should be composedof two judges, of whom one should be in the Chair, andthree military officers ; and that the expenses of anycounsel retained on behalf of those whose conduct wasunder investigation should be borne by the Crown.19. The War Cabinet had before them a Report on merchantship building, by Sir E. Geddes (Paper G.T.-1312).The War Cabinet were of opinion that it was essential toincrease the output of merchant shipbuilding up to at least the3,100,000 tons gross per annum.Sir Joseph Maclay, however, pressed for a larger output.The War Cabinet recognised that, unless this output isaccomplished, we might lose the war. At the same time, it was realised that, in order to obtain this increased rate of merchantship building, it will be necessary for the various Departmentsconcerned to make concessions, both as regards material and labour.For instance, Lord Derby pointed out the shortage of men for theprescribed strength of the Army overseas, and indicated that greater shortage would follow if 80,000 more men wrere withdrawnfrom the Army for shipbuilding, in addition to the large numbersthat were already being taken for agriculture and other purposes.In the same connection, Dr. Addison drew attention to thedifficulties in obtaining enough steel for the entire programme ofvarious Departments, as well as for other national services, amongwhich he also mentioned agriculture. He referred to the limitationsset by the plate-rolling capacity of this country and the UnitedStates of America. These and similar details of give-and-takewould have to be worked out by a Committee before it could bedecided definitely to authorise the programme laid down in theControllers Report.The Admiralty Controller pointed out that his programmedepended upon steel and men being provided without delay, andthat the fine weather was all-important in developing new works,&amp;c. Delay in dealing with the matter would naturally materiaRyaffect the forecast of output.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the Report in principle as a matter of extreme importance and urgency.180] &apos; C
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.July .10, 1917.(6.) To refer the Report to a Committee composed of The First Lord, tThe Secretary of State for War, andThe Minister of Munitions,With an independent Chairman,who should examine the steel and labour situation,having regard to the imperative requirements of theController as set out in the Report, as well as those ofother vital services.The Committee should report to the War Cabinet as towhat steps should be taken in order to bring theprogramme into fruition,(c.) That the Committee should treat the matter as one of extreme urgenc3r.It was further decided That a copy of the Report should not be sent to lord northcliffe, as proposed by Sir Eric Geddes, but thatMr. Joseph Davies should draft a letter on the subject tobe sent by the Prime Minister to President Wilson.
APPENDIX I.G.T.-1327. --Mesopotamia Commission Report.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.THE Army Council considered the extract from the decisions of the WarCabinet 175 (2), the Judge Advocate-General being present throughout the proceedings.They were of opinion that all officers in question should be given an opportunityof giving evidence on oath and calling witnesses in their defence in answer to those parts of the Report by which their conduct is impugned, and having been advised bythe Judge Advocate-General that no charge should be preferred against any of them until a Court of Inquiry has been held, the Council decided to give orders forthwithfor steps to be taken to hold such inquiry, which will be in public, unless at anyparticular stage the Court in the public interest otherwise determines. A civil legalassessor, who should, if possible, be a Judge of the High Court, should be appointed toassist the Court, and either the law officers of the Crown or counsel nominated by the attorney-General should present the case in Court.As a preliminary to a court-martial a &quot; summary of evidence &quot; must by law betaken, which would entail the presence of aU witnesses, both for the prosecution andthe defence. By means of a Court of Inquiry the cases can be more expeditiouslydealt with, and it will give the officers concerned the opportunity of defending them-selves against charges of incompetence.In any case in which the evidence would justify charges, and such a course were thought proper, the officer concerned could be tried by Court-martial. For thispurpose it would, however, be necessary to take legislative action to extend theprovision of Section 161 of the Army Act, under which trial must be commencedwithin 3 years from the date of the offence. The Army Council is, however, advised that such a course is open to grave objection.In any case in which it may be found that the evidence taken at the Court of inquiry will not legally support any charge, the Council will consider whether anyother action is required.In the event of a Court-martial, the preparation of the case will be entrusted tothe Treasury Solicitor, who will also be requested to assist the Military Authorities inconnection with the Court of Inquiry.The expense of Counsel who may be employed during any of these proceedingsby the officers whose conduct has been impugned should be charged against thepublic.The Council propose to appoint to be President of the Court of InquiryGeneral Sir Leslie Rundle, G.C.B.DERBY.July 7, 1917. .APPENDIX II.G.T.-1337.. .---Mesopotamia Commission :  Disciplinary Action.Memorandum by the Judge Advocate-General.S. ofS.,I AM of opinion that a Court of Inquiry is preferable to a Court-martial for thefollowing reasons : 1. It would be practically impossible to commence trial by Court-martial inNovember 1917, the latest date by which this can be done under theArmy Act.2. In the event of trial by Court-martial it would be necessary first to take asummary of evidence and afterwards to caU all the witnesses at the trial.This would necessitate taking away a large number of military witnessesfrom their duties in various theatres of war twice instead of once.3. In the case of a Court of Inquiry a Judge of the High Court could be madelegal assessor or under the Army (Courts of Inquiry) Act 1916 a member ofthe Court of Inquiry.
4. The Army Council on the recommendation of the Court of Inquiry couldrecommend His Majesty to remove or dismiss an officer from the service,,while the maximum punishment which a Corirt-martial could inflict for anyoffences which could possibly be charged is cashiering or dismissal.5. A Court of Inquiry could deal with matters affecting the military reputation ofthe officers in question as well as offences. It is only, fair to these officers that this should be conceded in view of Rule 124 (F) of the Rules ofProcedure under the Army Act, which provides : . (F.) &quot;Whenever any enquiry affects the character or militaryreputation of an officer or soldier, full opportunity must be afforded tothe officer or soldier of being present throughout the inquiry, and ofmaking any statement and of giving any evidence he may wish tomake or give, and of cross-examining any witness whose evidence,in his opinion, affects his character or military reputation, and producing any witnesses in defence of his character or militaryreputation.&quot;The officers concerned did not before the Mesopotamia Commission have the rightof being present throughout the enquiry, of cross-examining witnesses, or making astatement in their defence.(Signed) F. CASSEL,Judge Advocate-general  .July 9, 1917.
