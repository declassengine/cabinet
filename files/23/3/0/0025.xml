Cambon&apos;s request to be furnished with the names of theBritish representatives who will attend the Conference in Paris onthe 16th July (Paper G.T.-12S0).7. With reference to War Cabinet 164, Minute 9, and to sir george Perley&apos;s letter to the Prime Minister (Paper G.T.-1281) : The Prime Minister undertook to prepare a reply, for trans-mission to Sir Robert Borden, pointing out that theGovernment at Washington was, no doubt, being assailedfrom all sides by the Allies ; that it was probable that in naval matters the United States would work in close co-operation with His Majesty&apos;s Government ; but that, as acounterpoise to appease &quot;the French, the United StatesGovernment would probably, for the present, co-operate with them in military matters.Dutch Exports tothe UnitedKingdom andGermany.8. With reference to War Cabinet 172, Minute 4, the WarCabinet further considered the Dutch situation in the light of aMemorandum by Lord Robert Cecil (Paper G.T.-1269). (Appen-dix  .)Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that there was no doubt that theDutch were sending potatoes to Germany in violation of their agreement with us, according to which they had no right to sendpotatoes to Germany until they had sent us the 12,000 tons theyowe us.The larger question, however, was whether, in existing circum-stances, we ought to be satisfied with the present agreement, whichpermitted, roughly, half the surplus produce of Holland to go toGermany. According to very approximate figures produced by him,this amounted to about 1 per cent, of Germany&apos;s pre-war food supply, but the actual quantity was considerable, namely,about 700,000 tons, or perhaps 2 per cent, of Germany&apos;s presentconsumption.
3WG 177He himself was in favour of continuing to do our utmost, inconjunction with the United States of America, to put pressure onHolland, though he would not go so far as to carry out the french proposal to prohibit the import of wheat to Holland and drive thewhole poptdation from bread on to potatoes. Broadly speaking,the maximum effect of this would be to cut down Germany&apos;s food supplies by about 700,000 tons per annum. In any case, however,it would not be possible to stop the export of the whole of the meat.The Dutch had a large stock of cattle more than was requiredfor their own purposes. It would follow that, to the extent wesucceeded in persuading the Dutch to stop exports to Germany, wemust be prepared to buy their surplus produce.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out, however, that the adoption ofthe policy he advocated might involve serious consequences, whichthe Cabinet should take into account. He did not think there was any probability of Holland joining Germany, but there would doubtless be some unemployment and industrial unrest in Hollandif his policy were adopted.Mr. Balfour urged that the French proposals would reduceHolland to complete misery, for she depended on Germany for coal and steel, and if her exports to Germany were stopped she wouldbe unable to obtain supplies of these necessaries. It was impossibleto forecast what the effect of such serious pressure might be on theDutch people, who might even make common cause with the enemy.In this connection, however, it was pointed out that the Dutchmight lose their colonies, on which they set a high value. The aim off the Foreign Office throughout the war had been to keep Hollandneutral.The First Sea Lord stated that he was somewhat disturbed bythe opposition in Holland to the recent minefield arrangements, andwas thinking of modifying them in favour of the Dutch. On themain issue there were strong objections to a German domination of holland, which would give to the enemy new naval bases, and place the Scheldt under German control.The Shipping Controller stated that, from a shipping point ofview, it was desirable to continue to draw supplies as much aspossible from so near a neighbour.The War Cabinet, while strongly of opinion that Holland mustnot be driven into the arms of Germany, decided that Every effort should be made, in conjunction with the UnitedStates, to reduce the exports of Holland to Germany fromone-half to one-quarter of her surplus produce.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,Jnlxj 6, 1917.
APPENDIX. *G.T.-1269. ---The Dutch Situation.IN connection with the Foreign Office Memorandum on the Dutch situation of the18th June, and the telegrams Nos. 1950 and 1951 from Holland, I venture to thinkthat the Dutch situation requires the close attention of the War Cabinet. As theCabinet knows, the Dutch have exported since the beginning of the war very largequantities of foodstuffs to Germany. Until the middle of 1916, roughly speaking theywere exporting to Germany the whole of the surplus production beyond what was required for their own people. In order to limit that, we entered into certainagreements with the Dutch^agriculturists, the broad effect of which was to divide the&apos;Dutch exports between Germany and ourselves, in something like the pre-warproportions. Recently, owing presumably to the increasing want of provisions inGermany, the German Government have been pressing the Dutch to increase their exports to Germany in particular they are asking for potatoes. The position on that matter is&apos; that under the agreements the Dutch owe us some 12,000 tons of potatoes,and we are urging that they have no right to export potatoes to Germany until they have paid off their potato debt to ourselves. Apparently, in &apos; spite ofthese representations, an appreciable quantity of potatoes is going into Germany.Then, there is the question of cattle. Owing to the comparative failure of the foddercrops in Holland and the difficulties of importing fodder from overseas, the Dutchare threatening to export a large quantity of their surplus cattle to Germany. On theother hand, we have been urging the United States not to license the export to Hollandof any foodstuffs or fodder, unless the Dutch will abandon their exports to Germany,and it seems likely that the United States Government, sooner or later, will carry out this policy. The Germans may, and probably will, reply by threatening to cut off coal and shipbuilding materials and potash and dyes, for all of which articles the Dutchare absolutely dependent on imports from Germany.Besides all this, we have had a number of small controversies with the Dutch, inwhich we have accused them of showing xmdue/ partiality to Germany, particularly in allowing war material, in the shape of gravel for concrete entrenchments, to be carried over Dutch canals from Germany to the Western front.On the top of all this comes the declaration of the new danger zone in the north sea, which the Dutch say cuts them altogether off from communication with the outside world.In spite of all this, I am disposed to proceed with the policy as laid down, and toencourage the United States to put the utmost pressure on the Dutch to cut off theirtrading with Germany, recognising that later on it may be necessary to allow them to export a certain amount to Germany, though I hope much less than they are exportingat the present time. But the War Cabinet ought to be aware that this policy involves a certain amount of risk. It is just possible that the Dutch might be so provoked by it that they would throw themselves into the arms of Germany and allow her to occupy the Dutch coast. I think this extremely unlikely. It is more possible that the Dutchwill submit to Allied pressure, and that the Germans will thereupon reply by imposing,in the first place, the utmost economic pressure, and if that fails, as it probably would,it is conceivable that they might declare war on Holland. I do not myself think thatthis is at all probable ; all the signs are that the Germans are very anxious to conciliateDutch opinion, and have even gone so far as to offer them compensation for the sevenDutch ships they sunk in the Channel in February.But it must be recognised that if the full American policy is carried out, and theGermans reply by economic pressure1 on their side, a very serious state of things willbe created in Holland, and we must certainly be prepared for considerable disturbancesthere, and a great deal of indignation with us. In return for that we may hope, if thepolicy succeeds, to diminish German supplies to the extent shown in the annexedtable.Finally, it must not be forgotten that we are dependent on Holland for a large partof our margarine.
If the War Cabinet approve generally of the policy of pressure on Holland, I think they must he prepared to spend, if necessary, considerable additional sums in buyingDutch produce ; otherwise, whatever agreements are made with the Dutch authorities,the Dutch farmers will undoubtedly, in one way or another, export everything they canto Germany.(Initialled) R.

About 50 tons of newpotatoes waiting to be shipped to England were seized by crowd, which looted threerailway trucks and two lighters. Riot assumed most serious dimensions, and police and troops were at last obliged to fire on mob. One boy killed and one mortallywounded.
Sir-W. Toumley to Mr. Half our. (Received July 4, 8 a.m.)(No. 1951.)(Telegraphic.) The Hague, July 3, 1917, 543 p*m.My telegram No. 1875.Increasing of danger area of seas in immediate contiguity to Dutch coasts has created widespread feeling of irritation, which is, of course, being made most of by ouradversaries. M. Van Aalst came to me in state of great agitation this morning on thesubject and said he had decided to resign chairmanship of Trust. He added that itwas impossible for him to continue at the head of an institution which had becomelaughing-stock in consequence of closure of [? seas] to Dutch navigation. Press is full of angry articles and general feeling created is one of marked hostility. It appearedalso as an ungracious answer to shipping proposals just submitted.I was unable to explain situation, as I am without any official information on thesubject, a fact about which Van Aalst presumed to twit me in his wrath. I saw Ministerfor Foreign Affairs later. He seemed to be somewhat reassured by message he hadreceived from Netherlands Minister in London. I would venture to submit that some modification should be made, unless military reasons make any change impossible.o
