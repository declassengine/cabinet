The War Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary on thedecisions of the Inter-Ally Conference on the 7th August, 1917(Paper G.T.-1633).The War Cabinet noted that the following draft resolution,which had been approved at the previous meeting for submission tothe Inter-Ally Conference, had been dropped : &quot; Two French divisions will be withdrawn from theSalonica front and retained in the Salonica theatre of operations as a general reserve for employment in any theatrein accordance with military developments.&quot;The War Cabinet decided that the following paragraph shouldbe added to the amended draft resolutions presented to theConference : &quot; The British Government accept the reservations madeby M. Ribot and Baron Sonnino, subject to any withdrawal from Salonica being first submitted for discussion by theAllies&quot;;and directed The Secretary to alter the draft decisions as requisite beforecirculation at the forthcoming Conference.Stockholm 5. With reference to the proposed Stockholm Conference (war conference. Cabinet 202), the War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by, the Attorney-General, with a covering note by Sir Edward Carson(Paper G.T.-1624), and a copy of a Minute to Mr. Balfour by lord robert Cecil (Paper G.T.-1630).The War Cabinet discussed two points : (a.) Whether the Government should allow British delegates to proceed to Stockholm.(6.) Whether there should be an announcement in Parliamentof the Governments decision.On the first question the War Cabinet were agreed that, since may (War Cabinet 141, Minute 15), when our main object was to sustain the Russian Government, decisive changes had taken place.It was now clear that the influence of the Soviet in Russia wassteadily declining, and that the attendance of the British delegatesin Stockholm was less important than formerly. It was felt,however, that it would be much more convenient to the RussianGovernment, and more conducive to the maintenance of good relationsInter-AllyConference.
Soldiers&apos; and 6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theWorkmen&apos;s Secretary for Scotland (Paper G.T.-1625), dealing with a proposalCommittees. to hotel a meeting of the Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Council in Glasgow,at 3 p.M., on Saturday next, the 11th August.   It appeared that a 1Conference for the whole of Scotland was to be held on this date,and that similar conferences were   being arranged  in England.These latter the Home Secretary proposed to prohibit.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To confirm the proposed action of the Home Secretary;(6.) To authorise the Secretary for Scotland to prohibit the glasgow meeting ; the announcement of such prohibitionnot to be made until after 4 o&apos;clock on Friday next;(c.) To call the attention of the Secretary of State for War toWar Cabinet 200, Minute 1 (c), and to the desirability ofan announcement being made in Parliament, but notearlier than the Secretary for Scotland&apos;s announcement,that the Cabinet regarded the objects of such meetingsas illegal, and would not permit them to be held.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 8, 1917.obetween the British Government and the Labour Party, that theworking men themselves should refuse to attend rather than that theGovernment should announce their decision and thereby appear to dictate to the Labour Party. This course, it had been ascertained by personal enquiry, was also acceptable to the French Government. Fromthis point of view the best course appeared to be to leave the finaldecision until after the meeting of the Labour Party on Friday the10th August. As an objection to this course, however, it waspointed out that there was at present no certainty that the LabourParty might not cast a vote in favour of attendance at the stockholm conference, and that, in this case, the Government would be placedin a difficult position. The fact that the Trades Union Congress,to be held on the 3rd September, might oppose representation at stockholm, was felt to be too uncertain a factor to rely upon, sincethe Government would be bound to announce their decision long before that date.During the discussion the War Cabinet received a com-munication to the effect that the United States Government had refused to grant a passport to Mr. Morris Hillquist to proceed to stockholm, which indicated that they were opposed to participation.They were also informed that, whatever the decision of the other allies, the Italian Government had no intention of allowingrepresentatives of that country to attend.The War Cabinet decided that, in replies to questions in theHouse of Commons, Mr. Bonar Law should state that (a.) The   attendance   of   British    delegates   at   theConference would be illegal;(6.) Such a Conference could not be attended by british delegates without the permission of the Govern-ment;(c.) The whole question was being  examined by theGovernment;(d.) It was obviously one which   concerned   not   this government alone; and(e.) A full  statement would be made on Monday the13 th August.
