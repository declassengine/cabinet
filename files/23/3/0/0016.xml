1. THE War Cabinet had before them a letter from the AirBoard (Paper G.T.-1117) with reference to a request .from theItalian Government that they should be supplied with the inforaia-tion necessary to enable them to manufacture Pomeroy bullets.In view of their previous&apos; request that they should be supplied with half a million rounds of this kind of ammunition, and that, sofar as was known, Zeppelins had not been used, at any rate to any considerable extent, over Italian territory, the request of the ItalianGovernment appeared to indicate that such ammunition might be utilised for other purposes. In these circumstances, and in view ofthe great importance of secrecy in regard to these bullets, the WarCabinet decided that The proposal of the service members of the Air Board not tosupply the information asked for should be approved.Recruiting of 2. The War Cabinet had before   them memoranda  by theLabour from Minister of Labour (Papers G.T.-1011 and G.T.-10.S3) dealing withAbroad. the recruiting of labour from abroad and the confusion which had arisen through the unco-ordinated action of Government Depart-ments.The War Cabinet decided that- The Ministry of Labour should become definitely responsiblefor dealing with the recruiting and importation of alienlabour for employment in this country, and that Govern-ment Departments should consult the Ministry of labour at an early stage as to their requirements : this decision inno way to affect the recruiting of labour abroad for service abroad.Supply ofInformation toItaly with regardto Pomeroy Bullets.Reduced RailwayFares for labour on National Needs.3. The Minister of Labour brought to the notice of the WarCabinet the fact that the Railway Executive Committee of theBoard of Trade had given to the persons enrolled for agricultural labour by the National Service Department and by the Board ofAgriculture the right to reduced railway fares, but that no suchadvantage had been given to other labour selected for nationalwork which necessitated travelling by train.The War Cabinet requested Mr. Barnes to summon representatives of the Departmentsconcerned, with a view to drawing up a uniform system,and to confer with Lord Milner on the agricultural aspect of the case as might be necessary.Reconstruction ofthe War TradeAdvisoryCommittee.4. With reference to. War Cabinet 135, Minute 4, the WarCabinet approved the proposals of Lord Robert Cecil (paper g.T.-1037J (Appendix I) as to the future organisation of the war trade Advisory Committee.The western front:German StormingParties.5. The Director of Military Intelligence explained to the WarCabinet the principle upon which the Germans were training pickedmen for assaulting parties. He criticised the system on the groundthat, although certain advantages were gained by having thesehighly-trained men, the eliect on the moral of&apos; the remainder wasdetrimental to general efficiency. The strength of these stormtroops did not exceed 4 per cent, of the total infantry.
WC 168Casualties amongDoctors.Action betweenSeaplanes.6. Attention was drawn to the high proportion of casualties among doctors at the front, and the Secretary of State for Warundertook to report to the Cabinet on the subject.7. The First Sea Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that an engagement had taken place near Ostend betweenenemy and British seaplanes, and that one of each had beenbrought down. He added that the German single-seater seaplaneswere probably better than ours as regards climbing qualities.He stated that the matter of improving our resources in thisdirection was being enquired into. Provisionally, it was proposedto meet the situation by utilising fighting aeroplanes fitted with gas-bags.Submarines:The United Statesof America :naval co-operation.Lack of Destroyers.Prisoners of War.8. The First Sea Lord related to the War Cabinet certainengagements that had taken place between our vessels and enemy submarines, some of which appeared to have had successful results,and stated that one of our Special Service convoy sloops had been torpedoed and sunk, her captain being taken prisoner.9. The First Sea Lord read a paraphrase of a telegram sent by admiral Sims to his Government insisting on the great importanceof immediate naval assistance being rendered by the United States.10. The First Sea Lord brought to the notice of the WarCabinet the deficiency of destroyers which existed in the-british navy, and added that every possible effort was being made to remedy the same, and that a new programme would shortly be submitted tothe War Cabinet as the result of the efforts of Sir Eric Geddes. he mentioned that the Admiralty were now building 13-knot trawlers,which would relieve the situation by the end of the year, and whichwould be particularly useful, as they would be able to keep the seaswhen destroyers could not do so.[995-2]11. With reference to War Cabinet 164, Minute 10, the Secretary &apos;of State for War called the attention of the War Cabinet to importantinformation which had just come to hand as to the action of theFrench Government. A Conference had been held at Berne in the spring of this year of representatives of the French, German, andSwiss Governments, and out of this Conference certain proposals had emerged, and were, it would appear, on the point of being adopted.The chief of these proposals were as follows: (a.) The repatriation of N.GO.&apos;s and men over 48 years of ageI who had been prisoners for eighteen months.(6.) The repatriation of fathers, over 40 years of age, with three or more children,(c.) The repatriation of N.C.O.&apos;s and men not comprised inclasses (a) and (b), who had been prisoners for eighteen months., on a man-for-man and grade-for-grade basis, theexchange to take place monthly.(d.) The internment in Switzerland, so far as possible, of all officers who had   been   eighteen   months or more incaptivity.It was pointed out by Lord Derby and the representatives of theWar Office that the wide extension of the exchange of prisonerscontemplated in these proposals might have the most far-reachingeffects.    The number of British  prisoners affected immediatelyB 2
would only be about 15,000, and most of the remainder would not fall to be dealt with until March next. The chief danger lay inRussia. There were about 1^ million Austrian prisoners in Russiaand 2 million Russians in Germany and Austria. To add numbers to the Russian forces was unimportant; but to treble the Austrianreserve when the Allies were steadily wearing down the Austrians-was most undesirable.In view of the fact that all exchanges of Russian and austrian prisoners are detrimental to the cause of the Allies, andhaving regard to the fact that, in the present state of Russianopinion, any precedent set by the Western Allies would certainly befollowed by the Russians, the War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make animmediate and urgent representation to the FrenchGovernment against ratification of the proposed agreement.The British Mission to Holland should confine their effortswithin the limits already agreed on, and, while preparedto listen, were not to assent to any further proposals on thelines of the Berne Conference which might be put forward by the representatives of Germany.12. The First Sea Lord stated that the Admiralty had underconsideration the possibility of reducing the forces allotted to theBlockade, as a consequence of the request made to the United Statesof America to ration Scandinavian countries, and the new arrange-ments for ships to call at Halifax instead of Kirkwall.Commander Leverton Harris explained, however, that theUnited States Government were still hesitating, and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were continuing to urge them to take immediate and decisive action.13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs called theattention of the War Cabinet to the position in Norway as revealedby recent telegrams received from Sir M. Findlay, especiallyNo. 3206 (28th May), a Personal and Most Secret telegram datedthe 20th June, and a telegram which had arrived that morning(No. 3673). The War Cabinet had also before them a memorandumby the Director of Military Intelligence, dated the 11th June(Paper G.T.-1116).Mr. Balfour pointed out that the arbitrary actions of germany might at any moment thrust Norway into war, despite the great reluctance of the Norwegian Government to enter on such a course,and it was important that the line of British policy should be laiddown.Lord Derby stated that the General Staff were against the entry of Norway into the war if it could be avoided, as no troops could be spared for Norway, and in any case she would be an additional drain on our already strained resources. We had decided to supplysixteen aeroplanes to Norway, and any anti-aircraft guns suppliedwould be at the expense of our home defences. The question was,however, more naval than military, and if the naval advantagesoutweighed the disadvantages the General Staff would waive their objections.The First Sea Lord, in reference to the telegram sent toSir M. Findlay on the 25 th May, said that since the sending ofthat telegram the position had been affected by the decision of theUnited States to ration the Scandinavian countries, though it was doubtful to what extent, if at all, the United States had begun totake action. While it would be impossible to rely solely onrationing, yet with it the number of ships on blockade duty couldbe substantially reduced. From the standpoint of the Admiralty,the des;rability or otherwise of Norway joining the Allies turned
largely on the naval assistance which could be rendered by theUnited States of America, and Admiral Jellicoe suggested that theUnited States Government should be asked, whether they wereprepared to supply submarines, some destroyers, if possible, a cruiser squadron, and a division of battleships, to be based on our ports ready for eventualities.General Macdonogh emphasised the possibility of Germanyoverrunning Jutland, and obtaining thereby not only considerablesupplies ot food, but also favourable bases for air-raids on Norway.The Cabinet were reminded that, as a result of previousdecisions (War Cabinet 119, Minute 21 ; War Cabinet 126, Minute 9),there had been informal conversations with representatives of theNorwegian Government as to the character of any assistance whichmight be rendered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The War Cabinet were agreed that in any reply to Sir M.Findlay it was desirable, on the one hand, to discourage Norwayfrom entering the war, and, on the other,&apos; not to convey the sugges-tion that the Allies were impotent to help her should she find herselfforced to go to war. Our naval forces should at least be able toprotect Norway from invasion by sea, and we could provide a certainamount of protection against Zeppelin raids.A draft telegram to Sir M. Findlay was considered, but, in viewof the considerations set out above and the serious factor which the scandinavian countries may yet prove to be in determining thecourse of the war, the War Cabinet decided  To refer the whole question to the Cabinet Committee on war policy for early consideration, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in the meantime to outline the situation toMr. Page, so that he might ascertain in what ways hisGovernment would be prepared to co-operate in the eventof Norway declaring war.2, Whitehall Gardens.
