Housing Policy. 1. THE War Cabinet considered Lord Rhondda&apos;s Memorandumon Housing after the War (Paper G.T.-105S), and the proposal made by the Reconstruction Committee to the Local GovernmentBoard that a questionnaire should be issued to Local Authoritiesasking for information as to present and prospective houfeingconditions.The War Cabinet decided that The following communication which had been agreed to bythe President of the Local Government Board and theMinister of Reconstruction should be made to the LocalGovernment Board with a view to their taking the necessary action : :i Local Government Board Housing Policy.&quot; The War Cabinet have to-day given considerationto the Memorandum signed by your predecessor, lord rhondda, and, in view of the cessation of building whichhas taken place during the war, apart from the necessitywhich formerly existed in certain areas for additionalhousing accommodation, I am to say that the Local Govern-ment Board are authorised, in circulating their proposedquestionnaire to the Local Authorities, to request that it bereturned completed not later than the 15th October, andat the same time to give them an assurance that theGovernment recognises that it will be necessary to affordsubstantial financial assistance from public funds to thoseLocal Authorities who are prepared to carry through,without delay at the conclusion of the war, a programmeof housing for the working classes approved by the LocalGovernment Board.&quot;Ministry of Food.2. With reference to War Cabinet, 191, Minute 3, the WarCabinet further considered Lord Rhondda&apos;s Memorandum on office staff (Paper G.T.-1377), and agreed to Lord Rhondda&apos;s proposal inparagraph 4, that any man released by a department for service with the Ministry of Food should be counted as a man released forthe Army under the scheme whereby the Civil Service is releasing2,000 men (War Cabinet, 103, Minute 2).Redistribution ofLabour after theWar.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour on the preliminary steps to be taken immediatelywith a view to redistribution of labour after the war (Paper G.T.-56).It was felt that the Central Demobilisation Committee proposed inthe Memorandum, while no doubt representative, might provecumbrous in operation, and that a much smaller executive bodymight be more efficient.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter for further consideration and report toMr. Hodge and Dr. Addison.Coal for Italy. 4. With reference to War Cabinet, 173, Minute 0, the Ministerof Blockade reported that the position in Italy as, regards shortageof coal had not been alleviated, and that it was. giving rise to a situation of the gravest, possible character. The. actual requirements in that country were 700,000 tons a month, while the presentimports were not ^much more than, half, that amount. The solereserve in hand was that required for the Italian Navy, and thiscottld only be drawn upon in,the last resort. At least 990,000additional tons were,required in August to restore the situation whichhad been created by losses from submarines and shortage of shipping
The Western Front.5. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that our troops had carried out a successful raid in the neighbourhood of Lens, ona front of 600 yards, and to a depth of 3U0 yards.Salonica.The Eastern Front.[1365-194]6. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the GeneralOfficer Commanding at Salonica reported that a British detachment of 500 men had arrived from the Pirams; that three French regi-ments were now moving north from Athens ; and that two cavalry regiments were also withdrawing in the same direction. these movements indicated that the evacuation of Old Greece by the Allie&apos;dtroops was in progress.7. The Director of Military Intelligence communicated to theWar Cabinet the contents of various reports he had received form colonel Neilson, which indicated that the Germans were trying to clear the angle between the River Sereth and the Dniester, wherethe 7th Russian Army was being severely pressed. The 8th russian army was retiring in considerable disorder, the troops appeared tobe entirely out  of hand, and were  shooting any officers whoB 2(G.T.-1346). Unless this depletion could he arrested and theshortage made good, many munition factories would have to heclosed clown and railway traffic to a great extent suspended, whichmust seriously affect military operations ; nor could the effect of coalshortage upon the political situation and the national moral heignored. According to the Italian Ambassador there was even sometalk of transferring the poorer population from the North to theSouth of Italy in the winter months and of closing the schools(G.T.-1408). The matter had been discussed by representatives ofthe Foreign Office and the Shipping Controller, and the latter was notprepared to divert shipping for the conveyance of coal to Italyunless the War Cabinet would consent to modify their programme forthe reserves of wheat they had considered necessary to build up and maintain in the United Kingdom. There was no difficulty in sup-plying the coal from this country, but it was impossible to provideshipping without reducing that required for other essential services.It was suggested that it might be desirable to despatch a largespecial convoy of colliers under escort, in order to replenish the stocks in Italy, and to reassure the Italian Government and people.It was pointed out that the measures which were being takenby His Majesty&apos;s Government to provide large reserves of wheat inthis country might have been adopted with too close and exclusivea regard to this country&apos;s interests, and that if our Allies discoveredthe extent of these measures it would be difficult to meet the chargethey might bring that in the allocation of shipping, which was almost entirely in our hands, the British Government had beenactuated by unnecessarily selfish motives. It was further represented that the increasing shortage of coal in France made the situationeven more critical.The AYar Cabinet decided that a committee, composed asfollows : Lord Milner (in the chair),The Food Controller,The Shipping Controller,The Minister of Blockade,The President of the Board of Trade,A Representative of the Admiralty,shoidd meet the following afternoon to consider the wholequestion of coal supply for Italy and France, and should report immediately the result of their deliberations to theWar Cabinet.
attempted to check their withdrawal. In Colonel Neilson&apos;opinion the area to the north of the Ivovel-Grodno Railway was thenext German objective. This area was occupied by the RussianSpecial Army. Unless there was a remarkable recovery in theRussian moral it seemed probable that in a very short time the wholeof Galicia and the Bukowina would be cleared of Russian troops.A general break-up of the Russian forces was to be feared, whilethe return of hordes of deserters into Russian territory must affectadversely the moral of the nation. General Macdonogh furtherstated that there were signs that a German attack on the Riga frontduring the next fortnight must be looked for.Supply of Heavy 8. With reference to War Cabinet 173, Minute 8, and in viewArtillery to Eussia.   0f the facts enumerated in the previous paragraph, the War cabinet again considered the advisability of sending further munitions ofwar to Russia The Director of Military Intelligeiice undertook to submit, atthe next meeting of the War Cabinet, a brief statement showing the present position as regards the supply ofthese munitions.British East Africa. 9. With reference to War Cabinet 193, Minute 5, the WarCabinet again considered what steps might be taken in order to conclude the campaign in East Africa.The Director of Military Intelligence said that the transfer ofthree batteries of field artillery which had been re-formed in SouthAfrica to Egypt was in progress ; the guns had already arrived inEgypt, and the personnel were now on the Red Sea. He had tele-graphed to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff communicatingthe decision of the War Cabinet on the previous day, and suggesting that these three batteries should be moved as soon as possible from egypt to East Africa. General Macdonogh said that the UnionGovernment had promised to send a mounted unit to East Africa,and they had been asked to expedite its despatch, and also to providea second mounted unit with the least possible delay. It was sug-gested. that, should the Union Government not be in a position tosupply the second unit, an Indian Imperial Service Regiment mightbe sent instead.The Western - 10. The Director of Military Intelligence said that the French(French) Front. General Headquarters were somewhat chary of imparting preciseinfoi-mation as to what, was proceeding on their own front. Itappeared, however,, that for the last two months the Germans hadbeen making repeated and persistent efforts to recover the high ground which they had lost on the Craonne Ridge. GeneralMacdonogh said that he hoped to be in a position to give the WarCabinet more definite information on this subject on the following day.Mesopotamia. 11. Reference was made to a telegram, which had been receivedfrom Stockholm, communicating a report that the Turks intendedto make a supreme effort to drive the British forces out of Baghdadand southwards of the Persian Gulf. General Macdonogh said that similar reports had been received from other sources, but that someof the details of this particular telegram were obviously incorrect.General Maude was kept constantly informed of all information received by the War Office which related to this theatre of operations.General Falkenhayn had been appointed a Marshal in the TurkishArmy, and was now in command of all Turkish troops in Persia,Arabia, and Palestine, with his headquarters at Aleppo. Accordingto careful calculations made in the War Office, the Turks were
