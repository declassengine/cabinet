1. LORD MIDLETON made a statement to the War Cabineton the subject of the unrest in Ireland (Appendix I). He urgedthat, despite Mr. Asquith&apos;s statement on the 26th April, 1916, thatthe associations connected with the Dublin rising were proclaimedas &quot;illegal associations,&quot; the successive acts of the Governmenthave tended to establish a position for these illegal associations inIreland which has greatly strengthened them, and that if they were allowed to spread with impunity they would become a danger tothe Empire. He asked that the legal advisers of the Governmentshould be consulted as to what steps can be taken to stop the spread of republican doctrines. He knew that prosecution for speecheswas very difficult, but thought that newspapers and other seditiouspublications should be stopped.Sir Edward Carson said that he had heard rumours that thenext step of the Sinn Feiners would be to attack private isolatedhouses and take hostages.Lord Midleton confirmed this, and said that he had heard ofthe gates of a private house in a quiet district being pulled down.Mr. Walter Long had heard of a recrudescence of a form ofintimidation well known in Ireland, namely, half-spoken menacesor other insulting behaviour against landowners and leading farmerswho were suspect.Lord Midleton said that, according to the information at his disposal, the rapid development of the Sinn Fein movement inIreland was largely due to the release of Sinn Fein prisoners, andthe immediate object of the Sinn Feiners was to wreck the Con-vention. It was too soon yet to measure the effect of the recentwarning of the Catholic bishops against dangerous associations.The discussion was adjourned until later in the meeting(Minute 3).2. In accordance with the instructions contained in WarCabinet 169, Minute 18, the Judge Advocate-General reported thathe had perused the evidence and documents pertinent to the questionof disciplinary action regarding certain officers whose conduct hadbeen adversely reported on by the Mesopotamia Commission, andhad come to the conclusion that, except as regards the medicalbreakdown, the evidence was not sufficient to substantiate anycharges for the trial of any of the officers by court-martial. he pointed out that (a.) A good deal of the evidence was of a hearsay nature andconsequently inadmissible.(b.) Certain matters were not fully disclosed by the evidence,(c.) The enquiry by the Commissioners did not appear to havebeen conducted in all respects in accordance with theusual legal procedure.(d.) The officers concerned did not have the advantage of legalassistance.He inclined to the view, after his necessarily cursory study of thevarious cases, that, if it was decided to order courts-martial on theofficers, it would be necessary to try: .    General Sir B. Duff,Surgeon-General Hathaway,Surgeon-General Sir W. Babtie,Surgeon-General MacNeece, andGeneral Sir J. Nixon,though he was doubtful if a conviction would be obtained and thatin the case of the last three named officers they would probably beacquitted, but that if any officers were brought to trial it would bedifficult not to include all.He informed the War Cabinet that there were three lines ofaction: 
(1.) To deal with, thern under Article 525 of the Royal Warrantfor Pay, which reads : &quot;An officer shall be liable to beremoved from our Army at any time for misconduct &quot; ;in which case he thought that, with the exception ofpossibly Surgeon-General Hathaway, they would alldemand to be court-martialled, though such could not be claimed as a right.(2.) The Army Council could call upon the officer who, underthe Army Act, is directed to convene courts-martial (inthe case of the London District this would be general sir Francis Lloyd) to peruse the evidence when obtained,and use his judicial discretion as to convening courts-martial and the charges to be preferred. Obtaining theevidence, however, woidd take a very considerable timeowing to many of the witnesses being abroad, and theevidence would have to be taken in the presence of the accused.(3.) After investigation by the Army Council to deal with them under Article 527 of the Royal Warrant for Pay which reads: &quot; An officer who has not been guilty of mis-conduct may at any time be called upon to retire orresign his commission should the circumstances of thecase, in the opinion of our Army Council, require it.&quot;In connection with the delay that must necessarily arise if these officers were tried by court-martial, it was pointed out that thequestion was affected by the Statute of Limitations, which laid down that any trial must take place within three years from the committalof the offence, and that the first alleged offence took place inNovember 1914. Consequently, only a matter of four months couldelapse before the trials began.The Judge Advocate-General indicated that the charges might possibly be based on the grounds of failure to exercise due super-vision, the suppression of true facts, and failure to do their utmost;and that it would be necessary to prove that those charged had been guilty of active or passive culpable neglect of duty. The maximumpunishment for a proved charge of this nature was cashiering.He recommended that the Army Council should refer the caseof these five military officers to the Law Officers of the Crown and himself for their formal opinion.Lord Derby suggested another form of procedure, namely, thatthe Army Council should inform the several officers of the changes made against them by the Mesopotamia Commission, and ask themfor any remarks that they might wish to offer in their defence.Upon such being received, the Army Council became a judicialbody, and could acquit or take action to much the same extent as was possible by a court-martial, in charges of the nature previouslyreferred to.*The view of Sir E. Carson and Sir F. E. Smith on this proposal was that it did not constitute a fair trial, and that the accused couldnot be refused court-martial if they so desired.Brigadier - General Childs explained the provisions ofArticles 525 and 527 of the Royal Warrant for Pay, &amp;c. (see alsoWar Cabinet 169, Minute 18) and the cases to which they were applied.The Adjutant-General stated that if a case of culpable neglectarose on the part of an officer on, say, the Western front, the case would be reported, and if, after enquiry, such a charge appeared tobe substantiated, the officer in question would be tried by a general court-martial convened by the Commander-in-Ohief. This seemed,to the War Cabinet, to place the officers adversely reported on bythe Mesopotamia Commission in the same category as an officersimilarly charged with culpable neglect on the Western front.* At a subsequent War Cabinet Meeting- on the 6th July Lord Derby withdrewthis suggestion.
Sir E. Carson and the Attorney-General pointed out that theWar Cabinet had no legal right to dictate to the Army Councilwhether the officers should be tried or not, or how they should bedealt with, and that, as it was a military question, it must, by theprovisions of the Array Act, be left to the Army Council to decide ;but that, on the assumption that the Army Council agree to courts-martial being held, the War Cabinet could ask them to carry out their constitutional functions.The alternative for the War Cabinet was to put before Parlia-ment a Bill setting up a special tribunal of, say, two Judges and twomilitary officers to try all the officers concerned.This latter suggestion was criticised not only as a departure fromprecedent, but as a violation of the principle that a man is entitledto be tried by his peers, and on the ground that the existing legalmachinery was adequate to deal with these cases without setting upa further legal tribunal.The War Cabinet decided that The Army Council, after consultation with the Judge Advocate-General and the Law Officers of the Crown, should advisethem as to what disciplinary action, if any, they proposeto take against the officers whose conduct had beenadversely commented on by the Mesopotamia Commission.(See War Cabinet 177, Minute I.)The War Cabinet then proceeded to consider the question ofthe continued employment of any of the officers whose conduct wasunder consideration.Lord Derby stated that Surgeon-General Sir W. Babtie was theonly one now employed.The War Cabinet decided that In spite of the remarks made by the Commission as to the greatabilities of Sir William Babtie and the good work he was now said to be performing, they would not be justified, in.view of the charges preferred against him, in allowing himto continue to serve actively until the charges against himhad been dealt with, and therefore requested the Secretaryof State for War to suspend him.3. The War Cabinet resumed the consideration of the situationin Ireland, as set forth in Paper G.T.-1242, and, in accordance withthe decision of Meeting 174, Minute 1, the Lord Lieutenant, theCommander-in-Chief in Ireland, and the Inspector-General ofthe Royal Irish Constabulary, were present and gave their views.The Lord Lieutenant read a Note of an informal discussion heldon the previous day at Dublin Castle (Appendix II). The recom-mendations in this Note are as follows : It is desirable that a definite statement should be made by government against secessionist propaganda, and a warning should be issued forthwith that the promotion of suchopinions or organisations with that object, includingseditious utterances, will not be tolerated.Should the Convention be abandoned or fail, it would benecessary to increase the military forces, which have been and are likely to prove the most effective deterrent.Moreover, a considerable number of arrests and internments(not deportations) will have to be contemplated.The Lord Lieutenant considered that the increase of military force would only be necessary in the event of the abandonment or failureof the Convention, which, in his view, provided the last hope of thepolicy of conciliation. He regarded the impending election in east Clare as especially critical from the point of view of theThe Condition ofIreland.
prospects of the Convention. If the Sinn Feiners were victoriousit would determine the attitude of many who were now wavering.General Mahon said that the state of the country was becoming more disaffected and disloyal. He had about 34,000 troops (fighting strength) in Ireland, which number was sufficient to deal with any immediate emergency. But if the Convention should fail and theprospects of conciliation should disappear, and if widespreaddisloyalty should increase at the present rate, the prospect of aserious rising could not be excluded. In such an event, thedemands of the military authorities for troops in many localitieswould be so numerous that an increase of force would be essential.In this connection the Lord Lieutenant explained the import-ance of having in Ireland a force sufficiently large as to overawethe population. Such an overwhelming force would be the bestsecurity against rebellion.General Byrne did not think that the rebels had, at themoment, the means for an armed rising, but there had been achange of temper in the last fortnight. The release of the prisonerssynchronising with the East Clare election had made the peoplemore defiant, and had increased the difficulties of the police.Strong forces of the police and military co-operated in keepingorder at bye-elections.In the course of the discussion it transpired that the moreignorant people in Ireland did not realise that the Convention is confined to the discussion of some system of self-government within the Empire, and seriously believed that the creation of aseparate State was within the bounds of possibility.The War Cabinet felt, however, that it would be inadvisable tomake any announcement excluding the discussion of such proposals.It was agreed that such repressive action would irritate Irishopinion, and that there were positive advantages in allowing schemes,however extreme, to be raised at the Convention as a means of stimulating and uniting moderate and reasonable opinion.The Lord Lieutenant agreed that the policy of amnesty hadbeen right and successful to the extent that it had restrained themore moderate elements in the population from joining the extremists. In certain eventualities - he thought it possible thatthe more moderate Sinn Feiners might be induced to come into theConvention.General Byrne and Colonel Jolmstone, in reply to a question,stated that the reports of their intelligence officers did not confirm the rumours that attacks were contemplated on the meeting-houseof the Convention or on private houses in isolated districts. GeneralByrne added that about 9,000 National Volunteers had arms in their possession, and perhaps 2,500 others. A great many NationalVolunteers were joining the Irish Volunteers.The Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government,said he wished the soldiers and police to know that the Governmentwill give them every - support in maintaining law and order inIreland. He knew there was no more difficult task in the BritishEmpire. If strong action is taken which is precipitate, publicopinion here recoils, and our action has to be justified not only tothe public opinion of this country, but also to that of the UnitedStates. He thought that the soldiers and police had dischargedtheir duties with great discretion. There were symptoms that themore moderate elements in Ireland were drawing together andrelying on this country for support. It was most important thatany breakdown in the Convention should not be attributable to theBritish Government. Nothing should be done to make it difficult for the Convention to meet. This was especially important at thepresent moment, when the Convention, on which so much depends,was about to meet, and consequently, for reasons of broad policy,the police had to act with special discretion, although political considerations must not be allowed to interfere with the maintenance[1365-175]C
of public order. It was desirable that the whole civilised world should see that every facility was being given to the Convention, and that,if a breakdown should unfortunately occur, the responsibility didnot rest with the Government.The War Cabinet, while recognising the gravity of the situation,considered that the tendency of the discussion was to confirm*theviews expressed by the Chief Secretary in his report, dated the3rd July, prepared at the request of the War Cabinet (paper g.T.-1261).The War Cabinet decided that (a.) No immediate increase was necessary in the military forcein Ireland. In making this decision the War Cabinet.took note of Field-Marshal Lord Frenches advice that troops can very rapidly be transferred to Ireland (a division, e.g., in forty-eight hours) ; that to quarter thetroops in Ireland now would interfere with their training;and that they should normally be retained in GreatBritain for home defence.(6.) No additional powers, beyond those recently taken underthe Defence of the Realm Act, are required. The lord lieutenant and the General Officer Commanding expressedthemselves satisfied with these powers, which, as theChief Secretary stated, exceed those of any ever wieldedin the United Kingdom.(c.) Pending the Convention, no statement should he made bythe Government against secessionist propaganda.Convratio - ^&apos; ^e ^ar Cabinet briefly considered the present position of* . the arrangements for the  Convention.    The names of personsPresent Position. nominated by the Nationalist party had been received fromMr. Redmond only to-day. Two suggestions were made as to the choice of chairman : that he should be appointed by the Govern-ment, or that the Government should nominate a committee, and leave to it the selection of a chairman.(No decision was come to.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 5, 1917.
APPENDIX I.The Condition of Ireland.Notes prepared by Lord Midleton of his Statement to the War Cabinet.THE present position in Ireland cannot be appreciated without recalling the events which have occurred since the rebellion. It is immaterial, from the Irish stand-point, what the motives may have been which impelled the Cabinet to the actions whichhave successively&apos; followed each other. But the effect can only be appreciated bylooking at it from the Irish point of view, especially in view of Mr. AsquitlTs statementof the 26th April, 1916, that the Associations connected with the Dublin rising were tobe proclaimed as illegal Associations. Since then there had been a landslide in the opposite direction.Immediately after the rebellion, Mr. Asquith went to Ireland, and it has not beendenied that he shook hands with some of the prisoners who were awaiting trial on thecharge of murder. The execution of rebels was shortly afterwards stopped. Thennegotiations were set on foot for bringing Home Rule into force at once. Two months later, General Maxwell was removed. These events were openly trumpetted by the sinn Feiners, as showing that their rebeUion had advanced Irish politics more rapidly in a few days that the Nationalists had done in many years.In November last, these facts were brought before Mr. Duke and Lord Lansdowneby a deputation, and the great development of Sinn Fein energy, which was beginning,was pointed out, and the danger of allowing a large number of arms to be scatteredabout the country.Mr. Duke, in reply, pointed out that he could not get the arms which werescattered about the country surrendered without calling on Ulster to surrender itsarms, and he was strongly of opinion that no arms should be placed in anybody&apos;s handsunless under the control of the Government. He believed the renewal of Germaninterference to be entirely unfounded, and he believed further arrangements as regardsHome Rule to be quite impracticable under existing conditions.Lord Lansdowne stated that it was his opinion that there was no intention by theGovernment of renewing the attempt at Home Rule negotiations during the war.Shortly afterwards untried prisoners were released, and from that period the momentum of Sinn Fein has been immeasurably increased. In Christmas week, over120,000Z. was received from America in various sums, a considerable amount of whichis believed to have been remitted for political purposes. The recent warning byLord Esher from Paris on the extent to which German tendency is at work in Irelandmay be recalled in this connection.In January came the South Longford election. The Sinn Feiners entered on this without any organisation, and carried the seat mainly on two grounds : 1. That the farmers considered that the rebellion last year had saved them fromconscription.2. That the apparent apathy of the Government to Sinn Fein movement and con-ditions had convinced all the waverers that Sinn Fein was the winning side. At thiselection, for the first time in an organised manner, the declaration of candidates for an irish Republic was made. &quot;Mr. Dillon, who has always shown a leaning to the more extreme parties, made a speech on the 16th January at the time of the South Longford election, which I sent for communication to the Prime Minister. The gist of it was that the nationalist party deserved confidence for the good terms they have been trying to obtain for SinnFein, the numbers they had saved from execution, and the release of the untriedprisoners.The establishment of Sinn Fein branches began from that period with considerableregularity, and Sinn Fein candidatures were arranged for in several constituencies,especially where it was found possible to divide the Nationalist Party.When the fresh negotiations for a settlement were announced by the Governmentin March last, the position of the Nationalist Party was extremely doubtful, but it was still posible for them to regain the ground they had lost. In the opinion of all thosewho communicate with me in Dublin, Cork, and the West, the release of the prisonershas shattered the best chance ^of the Nationalist Party regaining its influence.[1365-.175] D
Branches of Sinn Fein, bearing the names of prominent prisoners, or Roger Casementand similar heroes, have grown up with startling rapidity in all parts of the country.In a single week, one reads of several branches in Co. Longford, Tyrone, Limerick,Tipperary, Kenmare, Cavan, Donegal, Meath, Cork, Armagh, Carlos, Leitrim, Bally-shannon, Mill Street, Killmaflock, South Monaghan, &amp;c.The speeches made by the released prisoners have been uniformly Republican;they bear on nothing but National freedom. The so-called &quot; loyal Nationalists&apos;&quot;bodies are beginning to pass resolutions declaring the Conference to be nominativeand not representative, and denouncing the Nationalists for attending it.The demand has been widely made that whatever the Convention may decideshould be subject, not to Parliament, but to a referendum^The absence of any prosecution or action on the part of the Government onlymakes the more moderate section believe that, if Republican speeches can he indulgedin with impunity, their advantage lies in joining the Extreme party. The recentwarning pressed by the Catholic clergy, issued by Cardinal Logue and the Bishop ofRoss, urging priests and people to beware of aU dangerous associations, shows a very greatnervousness on their part of these developments. Every manifestation which candiscourage Loyalists is openly carried out. Sinn Fein flags ^predominate. The policeregard the hanging out of the Union Jack as provocative. A body of troops whowere embarked at Dublin went down the river last Sunday, as an officer informed me,and were hooted and hissed from start to finish. On Monday last strong bodies of menwere parading Dublin, professing to want work, and bearing flags with &quot; We musteither have work or----.&quot;   These parties were slioiiting : &quot; Down with the aristocrats ! &quot;&quot;Down with Capital! &quot; &quot;Down with Religion ! &quot; &amp;cFor the moment, there is no question of outrage. Matters are going so fast in thedirection of the Extremists, that there is no occasion for outrage, and there would becomparatively little for the police to report.The election in East Clare is expected to be close, but it is only so because theNationalist candidate happens to be an exceptionally strong one. With an extendedfranchise it is possible that the Sinn Feiners will carry two seats out of three, ifmatters are allowed to continue in their present course.Our case is that unless the Government at once and promptly challenge the rightof the Sinn Fein party to proclaim and advocate the separation of Ireland from england, provided as they are with German money, in a few months time a majority in Ireland will have declared itself in favour of separation, and predominance of theBritish Parliament will only be secured by force. \On the above point I have no doubt in stating my views, and would do sopublicly. As regards what follows, I can only vouch that the information which I givecomes from sources which have been hitherto accurate, and predicted the rebellionlast year.   From such sources I gather : 1. That whatever building is selected for the Convention will be made the objectof an attack by the Sinn Feiners.2. That the Nationalists who attend the Convention will do so at personal risk.3. That outbreaks of feeling in Dublin and Cork, consequent on the Sinn Feinprisoners being released, may be renewed at any time.4. That there is a very bad spirit in the west.5. That arms are largely distributed alb over the country.I am afraid that no conditions could he less favourable than the above for themeeting of the Convention.I think immediate steps should be taken to restrain the Nationalist press and tosecure order.
WC 175APPENDIX II.The Condition of Ireland.Notes of Discussion held at Dublin Castle.Present:Lord Lieutenant.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.Inspector-General, R.I.C.Chief Commissioner, D.M.P.Under-Secretary.Assistant Under-Secretary.1. UNREST in Ireland is assuming very grave proportions and the organisationof it is proceeding. The disaffected are confident and aggressive. Two possibledangers are to be apprehended : (1) rioting or armed resistance ; (2) passive resist-ance with a view to making civil government impossible. The policy  of the ExecutiveGovernment must be conditioned largely by the prospects of the Convention, buteffective action to deal with the existing dangers would demand a full and consistentuse of the powers entrusted to the Executive, including those contained in the new defence of the Realm Regulation 9 (aa).2. The result of the contest in East Clare will have an important effect on their immediate activities. Should the Sinn Fein party win, the movement will grow in numbers and activity. On the other hand, failure to win will act as a check and encourage the moderate section of Sinn Feiners, who are not pledged to secession andmight even agree to take part in the Convention.3. A Sinn Fein victory would deprive the Constitutional Nationalists of their claim to voice national opinion and would provide a more than plausible argument tosupport Unionist opposition. It is questionable whether the Convention under thesecircumstances could be expected to have useful practical results.4. It is desirable that a definite statement should be made by Government againstsecessionist propaganda, and a warning should be issued forthwith that the promotion of such opinions or organisations with the object, including seditious utterances, willnot be tolerated.5. Should the Convention be abandoned or fail, it would be necessary to increasethe military forces, which have been, and are, likely to prove the most effective deterrent.Moreover, a considerable number of arrests and internments (not deportations) wiUhave to be contemplated.July 3, 1917.o
