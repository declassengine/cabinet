mercantile shipping Losses.8. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff stated the shipping-losses for the twenty-four hours ending noon, the 25th July. It waspointed out that the reports regarding the immunity of convoyedships were most encouraging. The inclusion of ships in a convoydepended upon the routes, but&apos;where convoys existed, ships couldbe brought into them without the option of the owner.The War Cabinet decided that The Admiralty should examine and report as to the port of origin and date of sailing of five ships reported sunk inthe Atlantic, with a view to ascertaining whether theycould not have been included in one or other of the atlantic convoys.The Submarine 9. With reference to War Cabinet 195, Minute 11, Lord RobertSituation. Cecil urged that it was desirable that we should give to the UnitedStates Government the fullest possible account of the methodsadopted to combat the German submarine campaign.The War Cabinet decided that -Mr. Philip Kerr should be instructed to consult the Admiraltyas to what information on this point he could include inthe memorandum he was preparing in accordance with war Cabinet 195, Minute 11.Periodical Reports. 10. It was suggested that the First Lord of the admiralty should be asked to submit reports at regular intervals to the WarCabinet, stating fully the progress resulting from the developments of new scientific methods adopted for dealing with the submarinemenace.The War Cabinet agreed that a statement should be prepared and submitted, when the date of further reports would besettled.German Operations 11. With reference to telegram No. 1137 of 24th July fromagainst Finland. Petrograd, by which information had been received that theGermans contemplated an attempt to land troops in Finland or onthe Baltic coast of Russia, the Director of Military Intelligence statedthat a report had been received to the effect that twenty-two German transports were reported to be in readiness for this purpose.The Director of Military Intelligence thought that the Gulf ofRiga was a more likely objective than Finland. The Russians were fully alive to the danger. The Deputy Chief of the Naval staff stated that eight British submarines were co-operating with theRussians in the Baltic and Gulf ,of Finland.Army Pay. 12. Lord Derby raised the. question of increasing the paj- ofmen in the Army, and stated that Mr. Appleton, the Secretary ofthe General Federation of Trade Unions, in co-operation withMr. 0&apos;Grady, M.P., had &quot;asked Members of Parliament to meet him at the House of Commons on Wednesday next, with a view tosubmitting a scheme for very large increases in the pay of the Army.&apos; [1365-196] B 2The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff stated that a report hadbeen received from Malta that a trawler had encountered an enemy submarine at very close quarters, 120 miles H.N.E. of Malta. after two hits by gunfire had been registered, the sirbmarine sank. depth charges were exploded, and the usual signs of damage became apparent.
Lord Derby estimated that the scheme would cost the Exchequer125 millious a year.Sir Edward Carson considered that it was very desirable thatthe Government should act in advance upon this matter, and notwait for pressure from outside. Though he agreed that Mr. Appleton&apos;scheme might be too expensive, he thought that the question ofincreasing soldiers&apos; pay was one that would have to be faced andconceded in some measure.The War Cabinet felt that this matter was one of very con-siderable importance, and requested Lord Derby to prepare, for their consideration, a comprehensivememorandum on the whole subject, with particular note ofcertain hard cases by themselves, and a calculation of thetotal cost to the State of each man, including separationallowance.British Assistance 13. With reference to War Cabinet 195, Minute 1, figures wereto Russia. submitted showing that, apart from guns, which were not at thepresent moment available, some 75,000 tons of material ordered bythe Russians in this country were now ready, and awaiting ship-ment. The Shipping Controller had allotted nine ships, with acarrying capacity of 70,000 tons, during the coming three weeks,and three of these ships were actually loading.General Poole pointed out that it took two months from the -date of shipment from this country for guns to reach the russian front.   He was satisfied that transportation difficulties at Archangelcotdd be and were being overcome.The War Cabinet decided that- The above-mentioned shipments should go forward, but thatthe question of the provision of guns should stand over for further discussion at a future meeting, when it mightbe&quot; possible to see more clearly whether there was any chance of the guns being used on the Russian front ifthey were sent before the closing of the port of Archangel.Spitsbergen. 14. TJae War Cabinet considered a letter received on  thesubject of Spitsbergen from Colonel Yate, M.P.
