Mr. ramsay 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 185, Minute 13, the WarMacdonald. Cabinet considered a letter from Mr. Philip Snowden to the PrimeMinister, urging that the Government should take some actionto facilitate the journey of Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Jowett toPetrograd :  aMr. Barnes undertook to use his good offices in favour ofMr. Macdonald and Mr. Jowett.Financial Position 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum in Canada. by the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-1260) on the subject ofthe Financial Position in Canada, together with certain telegramsthat had passed between the Colonial Office and the Governor-General of Canada.Sir Robert Chalmers, the Secretary of the Treasury, explainedthat, out of our liability to the extent of 69,000,0(J0 dollars, Canadawas placing at our disposal 25,000,000, which left a matter of44,000,000 to be provided by us. None of the funds being raised in the United States of America could be allocated to meet ourliabilities, and one of the conditions of any loan raised there wasthat the amount subscribed should be expended in purchases madein the United States. The matter had resolved itself into one inwhich, if Canada wanted orders, Canada must provide more dollars.It must be realised that, if funds were not forthcoming in Canada, allorders after September would have to cease.The Minister of Munitions added that our dependency onCanada with regard to munitions had reference to 18-poundershrapnel and 6-inch howitzer shell.The War Cabinet agreed that The Prime Minister should send a personal telegram to thePrime Minister of Canada, explaining the situation and making it clear that, unless Canada could make somearrangements for financing our purchases, it was impossibleto continue the placing of any further orders. In this telegram Sir Robert Borden should be reminded that. Canada had put great pressure upon the Government toplace orders in Canada rather than in the United States ofAmerica.Sir Robert Chalmers undertook to draft a telegram for thePrime Ministers consideration.Purchases by the 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by Lord CurzonEuropean Allies in covering a scheme for the co-ordination of Aflied purchases in thethe Unite &quot;^gfces     United States of America (Paper G.T.-122S).- -   nen Lord Curzon explained  that, since  the  Report  had  been circulated, representatives of the Admiralty had written to state thatthe Admiralty were prepared to accept the Report, subject to theirretaining a free hand to deal with the purchase in America of ships of all kinds, and the several kinds of oil-Mr. Balfour entered a strong protest against making anydifferentiation, especially in regard to shipbuilding, which was oneof the most serious subjects of negotiation between the British and american Governments.Mr. Clarke, of the Admiralty Contracts Department, consideredthat oils- were not a matter of any immediate urgency, as theAdmiralty had bought ahead sufficient to cover about eight months&apos;requirements of oil fuel. He explained that the Admiralty was practically the sole user of oil fuel in this country; but it was&quot; pointed out that the United States of America and our other Allieswere also in need of large quantities of this iuel.
WC 176The War Cabinet decided that-Having regardchases through to the great importance of concentrating pur-a single channel, both from the point ofview of this country, of our Allies, and for the convenience of the United States of America, the Admiralty claim forspecial treatment should not be allowed. They approvedLord Curzon&apos;s Report.The question of the selection of the President of the council was deferred for consideration at a later date.Wireless inMerchant Ships.it. The War Cabinet had under consideration a paper by theAdmiralty (Paper G.T.-1238) relative to the fitting of wireless inmerchant ships during the war, and the continuance of its use byoverseas merchant ships of 1,600 tons and over after the war. Itwas pointed out that two operators would be necessary during thewar, whereas one operator would suffice during conditions of peace.The War Cabinet requested The Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and the ShippingController to confer together, and, after deciding what wasthe best course to adopt, the Board of Trade to promote aBill, if necessary, to give effect to the decision.The Western Front.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theGerman attack on the French over a front of 11 miles had been ofa severe nature, but had been everywhere repulsed.The French Line.6. The War Cabinet considered telegram No. 637, dated the3rd July, 1917, from the British Ambassador in Paris, relative to ourtaking over from the French some of their line.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he thought this would be required of us next winter, but he did not anticipate that any definite request would be put forward by the FrenchGovernment for action before that time.The Eastern Front.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therewas no further information regarding the Russian offensive.Probably the lull was due to the need for reorganisation. He addedthat he had sent a telegram conveying his congratrdations toGeneral Brusiloff.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send atelegram of congratulation from the British to the RussianGovernment, through the Ambassador at Petrograd, and adding their congratulations to M. Kerensky, in caseSir George Buchanan thought it politic to convey them.Mesopotamia. 8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theRussians were active on the Persian front, which was an advantage to us, as it prevented extra pressure being put on General Maudeby the Turks. He added that he was sending a telegram of appreciation for this Russian action.Palestine.9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that GeneralFalkenhayn had proceeded to Asia Minor, and was endeavouring toassist with regard to the Baghdad operations of the Turks.   He
added that Jemal Pasha and General Falkenhayn did not appear tobe co-operating to their advantage, as the former was inclined to take all the Turkish troops available for the Palestine front.Heavy Guns for 10. With reference to War Cabinet 173, Minute 8 (ii), the Chief*taty- of the Imperial General Staff stated that he had received information to the effect that the French were unable to spare their share of the25 heavy batteries referred to, as they considered they required all their resources in this respect for their present and future opera-tions. Sir William Robertson stated that he had taken no action upto the present as regards any further British supply of heavybatteries, but that it might be possible to send 10 or 12.Naval Losses. 11. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that twosloops, when escorting a hospital ship, struck mines off Malta. Oneof the sloops had sunk, and the other had been beached. Thehospital ship was not damaged.Submarines.12. With reference to the report of a submarine attack on theUnited States troop convoy, the First Sea Lord informed the WarCabinet that he considered that the same submarine that carried outthe attack had recently shelled St. Miguel, in the Azores, and thatshe had been in that vicinity from at least the 23rd June.Air Raid on 13. With reference to the recent air raid on Harwich by theHarwich. Germans, the First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that wehad lost one &quot; America &quot; machine, which was burnt, and another&quot; America &quot; machine had been damaged by a shrapnel bomb.Air Raid onOstend.Loss of a RussianDestroyer.Hodeida.14. With regard to the recentbombingattack on the 3rd and4th July on Ostend and places in the vicinity, the First Sea Lordinformed the War Cabinet that 4J tons of bombs had been dropped by our air squadrons.15..The First Sea Lord stated that the Naval Attache at petrograd reported that a Russian destroyer had been sunk by a mine off Sulina.16. With reference to War Cabinet 173, Minute 20, the first sea Lord stated that the Commander-in-chief, East Indies, waskeeping a man-of-war off Hodeida, and it was hoped that the threat of further bombardment would cause the merchants to put pressure upon the authorities which would result in the release of british prisoners.Destroyers forthe White Sea.17. The War Cabinet had under consideration a communica-tion, No. 1079, from the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires in London toMr. Balfotir and telegrams from Petrograd, urging that two destroyers should be sent to the White Sea for patrol duties toreplace the two Russian destroyers under repair at Liverpool.The First Sea Lord explained that two destroyers wereabsolutely useless for the purpose. They could only escort one ship effectively; they could not both be continuously at sea; theywould require the continuous service of an oiler ; they could effect
Indian Eeforms. 18. The War Cabinet resumed the discussion which had been adjourned at their meeting on the 29th ultimo (War Cabinet 172,Minute 13):-The Secretary of State for India said that there was to bea debate in the following week in both Houses of Parliament on theReport of the Mesopotamia Commission. In his opinion it was essential that the results of the Commission^ enquiry and the-question of reforms in Indian administration should be kept entirely separate. If the War Cabinet concurred in this view, Mr. Chamber-lain suggested that emphasis should be laid upon this point by those who would initiate the debate in each House. It would be most unfortunate and inopportune if. from a discussion of the factors which were responsible for the medical and administrativebreakdown in Mesopotamia, there followed a debate on the desir-ability or otherwise of immediately extending self-government inIndia. Any dispositich to confound the two issues might be met by a statement to the effect that the Indian Government have, forthe last twelve months or more, been considering the questionof reform ; that their proposals had engaged the attention of thej India Office  since  the  beginning  of  the year;  and that  thewhole subject was&apos; now&quot; being sympathetically and closely examined by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Mr. Chamberlain said that therewas a&apos; tendency to condemn the present, practice of theGovernment resetting to Simla in the hot season. It was,however; pointed out that this&apos; practice was not open to thesame objections as when conditions were different, when facilitiesdf communication by rail and telegraph either did not exist or werein no Way comparable with those which obtain to-day. Hill stations were no longer, the preserve of the white man, and it was impossiblefor Englishmen j charged with heavy responsibilities, to work in theplains in India in the hot weather without loss of efficiency.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to the factthat the altruistic action of certain Indian Princes, in advocating&apos; self-government iii&apos; prdvihees adihinistered by the Indian&apos;- Obverh-&apos;ment, rHignf be credited with undiie&apos; importance y these verif Tfihdes1would be &apos;the last; to concede to the peoples of their own dominionsany real share in the administration.The point1 was also raised that there was no-real public opinionsit&apos;present in India;&apos; Before the war, any expression of such publicopinion as existed was always in favour of retrenchment in military expenditure. There was never any clamour for efficiency, but only for economy., , Consequently it&apos;was absurd to maintain, as had beendone in certain qriafiersrthaf if the Indians had had a greater share in the gbve/rhfneht the Mesdpotamian horrors might have beenobviated! The exact contrary would have been the case.; [1365-176] ,    &apos; Cno repairs at Archangel or elsewhere, and, when returned to us,they would be in an unserviceable condition.   - - .The War Cabinet decided.that- .;:.    : ,.    iIt was essential to supply some assistance in reply to this request from the Russian Government; but that to sendtwo destroyers would be a waste of effort. It was agreedthat the Admiralty should, in lieu; send four trawlers aspatrol boats, until the repairs to the two Russian destroyers were effected ; and requested the First Sea Lord to takethe&quot;&apos; necessary steps to expedite their refit as much aspossible.The War Cabinet further requested-The First Lord to send to the Foreign Office the material toenable the latter to prepare a satisfactory despatch inreply to the request of the Russian Government.
Liquor Restriction 19. With reference to War Cabinet 167, Minute 1, the Warand Control. Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Food Controller inregard to the increase in the output of beer (Paper G.T.-1266).The War Cabinet confirmed the increase up to 33-g- per cent, of thestandard barrelage for the quarter ending the 30th September, onthe conditions mentioned in the Food Controllers Memorandum,namely 1. That 13^ per cent, extra barrelage shall be brewed at agravity not exceeding 1036&quot; under the direction of theFood Controller, and shall be held at his disposal for distribution to munition areas and agricultural districtsfor harvest.Mr. Chamberlain said that he feared that the extension of self-government must mean an immediate loss of efficiency and animmediate increase of corruption. These things had, however, tobe faced. He wished a formula could be avoided, but it was out*ofthe question for His Majesty&apos;s Government to say that the door to eventual self-government was barred for all eternity. No one couldset bounds to&apos; the self-development of any community withinthe British Empire : facts and circumstances alone must, and would,set the limit.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was ingeneral agreement with&quot; much that Mr. Chamberlain had repre-sented. He suggested the following as a possible formula of our future policy in India : &quot;Our policy is to increase the share of natives in Indian9 administration as rapidly and to as great an extent as circum-stances will permit.&quot; The form which this administration (central and local)will ultimately take cannot yet be foreseen. Historically,religiously, ethnologically, the case of India at the presentmoment differs profoundly from the case of the self-governingdominions ; and the terminology which is applicable to thelatter may be, and at present is, quite inappropriate to theformer.&quot; The Government therefore think that it would be inconsistent with the interests of India to attempt now to markout the precise course which Indian reform must take in theremote future, and the precise shape which its constitution will ultimately assume ; but they are resolved to do all in their powerto develop the policy of increasing the influence of educatedIndian opinion in the conduct both of central and local affairs.&quot;The question, raised at the previous Meeting, of a Commissionto proceed to India to investigate the whole subject on the spot, wasbriefly reconsidered. . It was urged that, if the Secretary of Statefor India were Head of such a Commission, this very fact wouldgive rise to enlarged expectations impossible of realisation. On theother hand, it was again pointed out that the appointment of an inde-pendent Commission would in all probability place the Governmentin a dilemma in six months&apos; time. They would be faced wdth thenecessity of deciding between three separate schemes of reform, andthey would be as far off as to-day from a solution of the problem.It was further suggested that it was impossible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in the midst of a great war, to give adequate time and thought to the proper and full consideration of so important and complex a question.The discussion was again adjourned owing to the necessity foran immediate decision on the next question on the Agenda.
-. That brewers shall have the option of brewing 20 per cent,extra barrelage on the following conditions : (a.) That they brew 50 per cent, of the total amountthey are permitted to brew (including the extra 20 per cent.) at an average gravity oftheir total brew in the corresponding quarterof 1916.(6.) That they brew and distribute 50 per cent, ofthe total amount they are permitted to brew(including the extra 20 per cent.) at a gravitynot exceeding 10360.(c.) That no more than one-third of the total output for the quarter be distributed in any one month, but where the allowed quantity hasnot been reached in any month any balancemay be carried forward to next month.(3.) That to any person who has a right to claim barrelage orcertificates the brewer shall be entitled to give barrelageor certificates for 50 per cent, of the beer, not exceeding1036o.(4.) That, in the event of any brewer deciding within seven days from the date of the Order not to avail himself of thisoption, the Food Controller shall be free to transfer theright to brew his extra barrelage to some other brewer.The War Cabinet decided that The total output of beer for the year ending the 31st March,1918, should be 12,420,000 standard barrels, made up asfollows : 10,700,000 standard barrels, the statutory barrelageunder the Intoxicating Liquors (Output and Delivery)Order, plus 750,000 additional standard barrels for theArmy (to be brewed under licence), plus the additionalsummer beer, estimated at about 950,000 standard barrels.With regard to the malting to be resumed in September, whileit was assumed that malting will continue after that date, it wasdecided to postpone the decision as to the extent to which maltingshould take place until it was seen how the shipping situationdeveloped, and that no announcement in regard to the extent ofmalting should be made before the 1st August.It was decided that These Regulations should apply to the whole of the UnitedKingdom,&apos; no distinction being made in favour of Ireland.The War Cabinet instructed The&apos; Food Controller to issue an Order giving effect to these decisions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 5, 1917.
