WITH reference to War Cabinet 217, Minute 1, theSecretary said that, according to the latest information just received by him from the President of the Board of Trade, reports received from the Midland, the Great Western, the GreatNorthern, the Great Central, and South Eastern and ChathamRailway Companies were to the effect that there is no indication of the threatened strike materialising, and that the GreatWestern Railway Company reported that their employees were inclined to defer action until Wednesday next.The ThreatenedEailway Strike.1365-219]BPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1917.
The Effect of aBailway strike on MilitaryOperations in theWestern Front.2. The Secretary of State for War reported that he had asked his Department to let him know the effect of a railway strike on the position of the army in France. He had ascertained that the army would be self-supporting for a week, and possibly even for a fortnight, but only at the cost of a depletion of reserves which it would be very difficult to make good.East Africa. 3. The Chief of the  Imperial  General Staff read out thelatest communique from General van Deventer, which was being circulated to the War Cabinet, describing the progress of opera-tions in the Lindi district.Eoumania. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theRoumanian army was holding its own successfully. It wasoffering a stubborn resistance to the Germans, who were said tobe suffering heavy losses. This was the more satisfactory becausethe Roumanians could no longer count on the co-operation of theRussians.The Eastern Front.Increase inDeserters from theEnemy.Eussian Guns and prisoners Lost.in the summer ofthe fact that thecommencement of5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thenumber of deserters from the enemy on the Eastern front had risen from an average of about 400 a month1916 to over 4,000 in June 1917.General Robertson drew  attention  to german communique stated   that since  thetheir offensive they had captured 41,000 prisoners and 257 guns.The War Cabinet noted that the number of guiis capturedwas considerably less than earlier reports had indicated as beingprobable. In this connection it was recalled that during the paris Conference, held on the 7th and 8th July, 1917, the FrenchGovernment had received information to the effect that 600Russian guns had been captured by the enemy.The Italian Front. 6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theItalian offensive was opened on the previous day, with satis-factofy initial results, but that very little definite information was at present available.During the meeting, further details were received indicating the capture of a number of positions by the Italian forces, as wellas 4,700 prisoners.Mesopotamia. 7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegramfrom General Maude to the effect that the Russian military situa-tion precluded any great offensive in the Mesopotamia theatrethis year, but stating that small operations would be undertaken.General Maude said that he had visited the troops in varioussectors, and he gave a very favourable account of their health,moral, and fighting spirit, notwithstanding the recent exception-ally hot weather.Salonica. 8. The Chief of the  Imperial General Staff confirmed his statement recorded in War Cabinet 213, Minute 5, that general sarrail had declined to detach any troops under his Command to occupy that portion of the British line which was at present heldby the Division to be withdrawn for service in Egypt. general milne had reported that, on the withdrawal of the Division, his forces would not be in sufficient strength to hold the present lengthof front. General Robertson said that he was again making urgent
220General Sarrail. 9. The above report led to a discussion on the question ofGeneral Sarrail. It was felt that his refusal provided anadditional reason for pressing once more upon the French Govern-ment the necessity of withdrawing General Sarrail.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention tothe strong objections entertained by the Serbian militaryauthorities to General Sarrail as Generalissimo on the Salonicafront. The Serbian Government had suggested that general sarrail&apos;s staff did not inspire confidence, and that they should bereplaced by a more efficient staff, the composition of which mightbe international. It was important, from the Foreign Officepoint of view, that some action of this nature should be taken,and Mr. Balfour suggested that it might be advisable to send out to Salonica an influential British Mission to investigate andreport on the situation.With reference to War Cabinet 205, Minute 3, the PrimeMinister stated that he had not found an opportunity to raise thisquestion with the French Ministers during their recent visit toLondon.The War Cabinet considered that it would be difficult to send a soldier as Head of the Mission, as he would have to be an officerof high rank, and his mission was bound to be regarded withsuspicion. They considered that it might be desirable to sendsomeone of political status, for the express purpose of encouraging the Serbians, although in the course of his visit hewould, no doubt, obtain valuable information.The question was adjourned for later consideration, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertaking to consult, in the meantime, his Department further on thesubject.10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had at present nothing to add to the latest communique recording aslight^ advance east of Ypres. Out of 147 German Divisions onthe Western front, 69 were now opposed to the British forces. Thesituation, consequently, offered a favourable opportunity for the resumption of the French attack, as the enemy reserves had nowbeen drawn to meet the British offensive. At the point designatedfor the next French attack there- were 24 French Divisions avail-able which had not been in the line since Arras, opposing 10German Divisions, 5 of which had recently been engaged.General Robertson stated that, since the recent operationsbegan, the&apos;Germans had withdrawn 22 Divisions, 11 of which hadbeen taken from the St. Julian-Langemarck front, whereas theBritish had only withdrawn 10 Divisions (see also Minute 15).M. Tardieu&apos;s 11. With reference to War Cabinet 213, Minute 4, the WarLetter. Cabinet, further discussed what action could be taken to dispelany false impression which might have been created byM. Tardieu&apos;s statement in the American press, without causingfriction or controversy with the French Government. Variousexpedients were considered, e.g.: (1.) That the United States press correspondent accredited.  to British General Headquarters in France should be told certain essential facts, for communication to theAmerican  press,  controverting  M.  Tarclieus  mis-leading statements.[1365-219] B 2The western front.representations to General Foch on the subject, and that if hecould not secure a satisfactory arrangement he would be obligedto bring the matter agam before the War Cabinet uu&quot;0eo-
(2.) That the information department of the Foreign office should, in concert with the General Staff, prepare a brief statement which should be telegraphed to lord northcliffe, who should be instructed to introduce 4t ina speech to be made by hirn at an early date.(3.) That the publication of the facts contained in the above statement should be entrusted to Mr. Geoffrey Butler,who had recently been employed by the Foreign Officeand had accompanied Mr. Balfour on his mission.Mr. Butler, it was stated, had already been conspicu-ously successful in establishing friendly relations withthe American press.The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Butler was the most suitable medium, and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs undertook to make thenecessary arrangements, after consultation with theChief of the Imperial General Staff.Cyprus. 12. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatGenera,! Foch was anxious to be granted the provisional sanction of His Majesty-&apos;s Government to his establishing a temporaryBase in Cyprus.for possible future operations by the French.The discussion was postponed until the views of the colonial secretary were available.Bulgaria. 13. The Chief of the Imperial  General Staff stated that,according to reports which had been received by his Department,King Ferdinand had left Bulgaria, last November, and that nothing was at present forthcoming to show that he had everreturned to his own country. The latest information indicated that he was now, or had been recently, at Bale.Austrian Prisoners 14. The Secretary of State for War referred to the action of01 War. the Austrian Government in releasing Captain Stanley Wilson,M.P., who had been a prisoner of war in their hands, andpermitting him to return to England. The Austrian Govern-ment had attached no conditions of any kind to his release.Lord Derby stated, however, that he was aware that theAustrian Government were very anxious for the return of certainAustrian officers now in England, and he cited three cases inparticular, in two of which the officers were quite unfit formilitary service.The War Cabinet agreed that this action called, and thatthe present moment was propitious, for a display of reciprocalgenerosity on our part.   They accordingly authorised;&apos; The Secretary of State for War to release an Austrian officerprisoner whose return would be specially acceptable tohis Government.The Western 15. With reference to Minute 10, the War Cabinet received,Front. in the course of the meeting, information to the effect that theFrench had attacked that morning on the Verdun front, and upto the time of the despatch of the communique, 8.30 A.M., the attack was progressing favourably. Two thousand prisoners hadalready been captured.
Bombing raids . 16. The First Sea Lord reported  various  bombing   raids-  which had been carried out on the night of the 18th-19th instantand the morning of the 19th. on the following objectives: St. Pierre Station and sidings,Ghent,Thourout Station,Bruges Docks.All our machines returned safely from these raids.Submarines. 17. The First Sea Lord reported that the Special  ServiceVessel &quot; Penshurst &quot; stated that she had engaged an enemy submarine, by gunfire, 1S5 miles from Ushant on the 19th instant.The fire had taken effect, and the Commander of the &quot;Penshurst&quot;reported that he did not think that the submarine could remainsubmerged long at a time.Admiral -Jellicoe further reported that the Special ServiceVessel Tay and Tyne &quot; had been torpedoed 153 miles fromUshant. There were no casualties, and it was hoped to save theship.Admiral Kolchak. IS. The First Sea Lord stated that Admiral Kolchak, latelycommanding the Russian Black Sea Fleet, was now in England.He was on his way to America, by invitation of the United StatesGovernment, who wished to consult him in regard to mines inparticular. Admiral Kolchak had stated to the First Sea Lordthat discipline in the Baltic Battle Fleet was non-existent, butthat conditions were more satisfactory in the destroyers and submarines.19. The War Cabinet considered the amendments to theCorn Production Bill wdiich had been adopted in the House ofLords and which were due to be discussed in the House ofCommons this afternoon.The War Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper G.T. 1763). It was explainedthat some of the amendments adopted by the Lords had been moved with the knowledge and approval of the Government;other amendments had been adojuted in opposition to theGovernment.Three amendments adopted by the Lords were likely to be strongly opposed in the House of Commons i (a.) The amendment which enables the Agricultural wages board to appoint District Wages Committees for such areas as the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries mayby Regulation prescribe.The Government had put forward this amendment to meet the criticism of those wdio complained that wages would be fixed by officials in Whitehall. The intention had been that the DistrictWages Committees would fix wages subject to the approval of theCentral Board. If the Central Board disapproved of the actionof the District Committee and the latter refused to comply wriththe wishes of the former, then the Central Board would itself fix the rates. But this arrangement was being severely criticised inthe Press, on the ground that the areas of the Committees wouldbe small and the pressure of the local farmers considerable. This,however, was a mistake. Except in the case of the very largestcounties it was intended to have county areas, or groups of counties.(&amp;.) The second amendment which was sure to meet with opposition, especially from Labour Members, allowedCorn ProductionBill:Lords&apos;Amendments.
a non-able-bodied workman to be employed at lessthan the minimum wage, provided that within14 days of a specific date the employer notified theDistrict Wages Committee of the wage agreed to bepaid and the circumstances which rendered the workman not an able-bodied workman. The DistrictWages Committee could disallow or vary the contract.The Bill as it left the Commons provided for the licensing ofnon-able-bodied workmen by the Wages Agricultural Board. Ithad been objected in the Lords that this was an impracticablemethod, as thousands of permits would be required.(c.) The third amendment inserted by the Lords dealt withthe right of appeal. In the Bill as it reached the lords, the Board of Agriculture was empowered tointerfere with a farmer in the interests both of goodhusbandry and of general national policy.The ground of national policy was objected to as too wide,and the Government had accepted instead the phrase &quot; in theinterests of food production.&quot; Further, the Government had accepted an amendment giving an appeal to an Arbitrator incases where an order was given on the ground of husbandry.This, however, had been extended by the Lords to cover otherorders of the Board of Agriculture dealing with food production.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, who had been inconsultation with Lord Lansdowne and other members of theHouse of Lords, said that, while the large farmers might be ableto look after themselves, the smaller farmers felt that the machineryproposed in the Bill was so complicated as to be likely to lead to much friction. He recognised that the opposition to the amend-ments in the House of Commons would he considerable, and he advised a compromise.The Minister of Labour said that, while he did not think thefirst and second amendments would be very material in practice,it was certain that opposition to them was hardening among theLabour Members.The War Cabinet decided that (i) The Ministers in charge of the Bill should invite theHouse of Commons to disagree with amendments (a)and (b), and to accept amendment (c) above.(ii) Lord Curzon should endeavour to confer   immediatelywith representatives of the House of Lords, with aview to explaining the Government&apos;s decision andsecuring, if possible, their approval.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 20, 1917.
