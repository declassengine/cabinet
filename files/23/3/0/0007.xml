THE Director of Military Intelligence, for the Chief of theGerman Forces. Imperial General Staff, reported that the Commander-in-Chief ofthe British Expeditionary Force had nothing to add to the publishedcommuniques in regard to the recent fighting. He stated that atthe battle of Messines the British attack had b^en made againstfour German divisions holding the line, and that these had been reinforced by four and a half divisions from reserve, and that another division from reserve had been pushed forward to theNorth of the Ypres-Menin road. Our advance had been made atthe moment that the Saxons were being relieved by the Bavarians.[1360-160] BPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1917
2Though it was not known how many Germans had actually been blown up by the British mines, there was no doubt that the moral effect of the latter had been tremendous.The Italian Front.2. In reference to Italian statements of large Austrian rein-forcements having been brought against the Italians from theEastern Front, the Director of Military Intelligence explained that three divisions was the maximum which, according to his information,had been so transferred since the 14th May.Russian Offensive.Submarines.3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that he hadreceived information from Jassy to the effect that the troops of the9th Russian Army in the Bukowina d definitely refused to take the offensive.4. The First Sea Lord reported several actions with enemy submarines, the results of two of which were thought to be promising.He also made the usual statement of mercantile shipping losses.Loss of a Torpedo- 5. The First Sea Lord reported the loss of an old type torpedohoat. boat in a collision in the Thames Estuary on the 10th June.Destruction of 6. The First Sea Lord reported that a German seaplane hadEnemy Seaplanes.     been brought down by gunfire by the yacht &quot; Diane&apos;&apos; and the twoaviators captured; and that a second German seaplane had been blown up and destroyed.(Convoys from 7. The First Sea Lord stated that the convoy from AmericaAmerica. had arrived safely, and that the captain of H.M.S. &quot; Roxburgh,&quot; theescorting cruiser, had reported that, of the total number&apos; of the convoy of twelve ships which had started, two had been forced toreturn owing to their lack of speed, but that there were no difficultiesin convoying, except those which might be due to fog, and that he anticipated that it would be possible to bring over convoys of twenty. vessels. The First Sea Lord added that it was necessary that thevessels convoyed should be fairly fast and be of uniform speed. Thedifficulty he found at the moment was that of supplying cruisers forthe escort.Oil for the Fleet.8. The First Sea Lord reported that he had decided to establishweekly convoys of oil-tankers, as so many of these vessels had recently been lost, and that, in order to make good, eighteen of thestandard ships under construction would be oil-carriers. He proposedto bring the whole question of the supply of oil for the fleet beforethe War Cabinet, because the situation had become so critical that, inhis opinion, assistance would have to be asked for from the UnitedStates.Naval and MilitaryMissions to theUnited States.9. The First Sea Lord pointed out that the Admiralty, had norepresentative in the United States, and suggested that a liaison officer should be appointed. In order to help in the matter he had asked Admiral Sims if an American Naval Officer could be sent overto this country for liaison duties in connection with convoy work.The Secretary of State for War added that the Army wassimilarly unrepresented.
Owing to the necessity for handling this matter carefully, it wasagreed that The First Sea Lord and the Secretary of State for War should consult with Mr. Balfour before any definite proposal in thematter was made.British Ambassador 10. The Prime Minister read a letter, dated the 8th June, 1917,at Petrograd. fr0m ]y[  Thomas, jn which the writer stated that he was strongly opposed to the withdrawal of Sir George Buchanan, for the reasonsthat the French Ambassador had already gone away and that theFrench and British were relying on Sir George Buchanan&apos;s knowledge and experience.It was agreed that The withdrawal of Sir George Buchanan was not necessitated by the decision that Mr. Henderson should proceed toPetrograd (War Cabinet 144, Minute 1).Salonica. 11. The War Cabinet discussed the  attitude of the FrenchGovernment with reference to the demand for the withdrawal ofGeneral Sarrail. It was pointed out that the French Governmentwas in a very difficult position, and that from a purely military pointof view a change of Command at this moment could hardly bejustified.The War Cabinet decided that The Prime Minister should reply to M. Bibot expressing the satisfaction of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the willingness of the French Government to transfer General Sarrail fromthe Command in Macedonia, but agreeing that the transfershould not be carried out until after the present criticalphase of the military situation in Greece had passed.As regards the succession to General Sarrail, it was understoodthat, while the French were unwilling to accept the suggestion thatthe Command should be put in the hands of General Mishitch, theywere willing to consider any alternative suggestion for a Commander -in-Chief, not necessarily a French General, including the suggestionthat General Mishitch should be Chief of Staff to General Sarrau&apos;&amp;successor, and that there should be a common Interallied Staff.The War Cabinet invited The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to consider the questionof a suitable successor to General Sarrail, and to suggest the name of some French General who would be acceptable to the British General Staff.Greece- 12. Lord Robert Cecil gave a summary of the latest information with regard to the manner in which the Allied policy in Greece wasbeing carried out by M. Jonnart and General Sarrail. Theinformation received from Athens and Salonica had been to the effectthat a large French force was being brought by sea to the piraeus inorder to overawe the Greeks. This policy was, in his opinion,inconsistent with the agreement arrived at in London, and he had asked, the British Charge d&apos;Affaires in Paris to ask for explanations.From these it appeared that, while M. Ribot denied that troops werebeing landed, both M. Painleve&quot; and Admiral Lacaze laid stress onthe need of having overwhelming force behind M. Jonnarfs demandfor the King&apos;s abdication. The last telegram from Athens evenstated that 10,000 men were being landed the next night (Sir F.E)liot, Athens, 1243). A telegram had, however, been received[1365-160] B 2
that morning from Paris to say the French Government had no intention of landing troops at Piraeus.A further question had arisen with regard to a report that theFrench were sending 200 Senegalese to Patras. This had, however,been countermanded in consequence of our protest. *In the discussion which followed, it was pointed out that the wording of the clause of the Conclusions of the Anglo-french conference held in London on the 28th/29th May, under which general Sarrail was authorised to hold troops in readiness to proceedto the Isthmus of Corinth, might conceivably be ambiguous, althoughthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained that, in militarylanguage, the words &quot; in readiness to proceed,&quot; while they mightcover their being embarked on the transports, could obviously not include their actually being sent by sea to the neighbourhood of their,possible destination. It was also pointed out that the instructionssent by M. Painleve&quot; to General Sarrail at the time might be thought to contemplate the possibility of troops being sent to Athens before the move into Thessaly took place. It was also suggested that, whetheror not the French action was entirely on the lines of what had been contemplated at the recent Conference, it might perhaps be the most efficient way of dealing with the situation. In any case, it was not really clear whether troops were being landed or not, or, indeed,what was happening.The War Cabinet decided that The .first step was to obtain precise details as to what was actually taking place, and Lord Robert Cecil undertook togive effect to this decision.The United Statesof America.Artillery Calibres.13. Mr. Balfour drew the attention of the War Cabinet to thedifficulty which had arisen in the United States with regard to the type of armament to be employed. The American Army had very good weapons of their own, and during the war American factorieshad been equipped on an immense scale to manufacture guns andrifles for the British Army, and the American Army could be equippedmuch more rapidly if the British types were adopted. Against this,however, there was naturally strong prejudice in American Armycircles. A compromise had been arrived at by which guns of theBritish 18-pr. type were to be bored to suit the American shell, buthe had been informed by experts that this might give very unsatis-factory results.The War Cabinet concurred in Mr. Balfour&apos;s suggestion that heshould meet General Pershing and some of the ordnanceand munition experts before the former left for the Frenchfront.Probable Arrival 14, The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that-of American General Pershing stated that the Americans would have from 175,000Forces- to 200,000 men in the field bv November.Mr ramsay 15. The War Cabinet discussed the situation which had arisenna out of the refusal of the Seamens and Firemen&apos;s Union to allowMessrs. Bamsay Macdonald and Jowett to sail for Stockholm. Itwas tmderstood that Mr. Roberts and the representatives of themajority of the Labour Party had also stayed behind to awaitdevelopments, and that the only person who had actually sailed onthe &quot; Vulture &quot; was Mrs. Pankhurst. It was generally agreed that,as Mr. R amsay Macdonald was not engaged on any Governmentmission, but had simply been given a permit to travel to Russia,there was no reason to interfere further in the matter.   It was
pointed out that when seamen and firemen had, some 18 months ago, refused to carry a number of Irish labourers who wished to escape Compulsory Service by going to America, no action had beentaken.The Beport of the 16. The War Cabinet resumed the discussion on the Report ofMesopotamia the Mesopotamia Commission (War Cabinet Meeting 156, Minute 1).Commission. At that Meeting they had recorded their opinion that, having regardto the terms of Section 6 of the Special Commission (Dardanellesand Mesopotamia) Act of 1916, they had practically no option in thematter of the publication of the Report, subject to such excisions as might be deemed to be necessary in the public interest.It was suggested that the Report, with its revelation of administrative incompetence, might, both at home and abroad,prove very damaging to the prestige of our Armies, and that itreflected, in particular, very seriously upon the efficiency of thepresent system of the Government in India.The Secretary of State for War called special attention to theeffect that might be produced by the contents of Mr. Wedgwood&apos;sReport, which he assumed would have to be published simultaneously.Public confidence in this country, in India, and abroad generally,which had already sustained very rude shocks, could hardly fail tobe profoundly disturbed, and the effort upon the national temperand the national resolution to continue to prosecute the war with allpossible vigour and with no relaxation of effect might be very grave ;while the United States of America, which at the present moment was seeking counsel from us on all matters of military administration,might be inclined, in the circumstances, to question the value of ouradvice and our competence to instruct.The War Cabinet were also reminded that, whereas theDardanelles Expedition was a closed chapter in the history of thewar, operations in Mesopotamia were still proceeding ; the Reportmight place in the hands of our enemies information as to our policyand the scope of those operations in the future which might prove tobe invaluable.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, in view of the termsof the above-mentioned Act, it would be almost impossible to withhold publication ; that the pressure of Parliamentary and publicopinion would eventually become practically irresistible ; and thatthe Government could only refuse to publish if they were prepared,on the grounds that the publication during the war would be highlydetrimental to the public interest, to face a Vote of Censure and to stand or fall by the result. Any yielding by the Government after a definite pronouncement to the above effect had been made wouldbe suicidal. Lord George Hamilton, the Chairman of the Corn-mission and a statesman of great experience, had stated toLord Ourzon, and his colleagues would, no doubt, if forced bycircumstances, repeat the statement in Parliament, that the report was expressly prepared by his Commission for publication.The War Cabinet were further reminded that they hadpermitted the publication of the Report of the dardanelles commission, which reflected upon the present occupants of theOpposition Bench, and to withhold publication in this case might give rise to baseless but embarrassing rumours to the effect that theGovernment, in their decision, were sheltering themselves behind theplea of public interest; whereas the facts were that the present report only animadverted with especial severity upon the conductand administration of officials whose names were comparativelyunknown to the general public, and who were in no sense outstandingfigures in the war.An additional argument advanced in favour of publication wasthat the British Government were traditionally credited  with a-  readiness to acknowledge frankly and unreservedly their; failures .
and that, as all defects had long since been remedied, and theprincipal culprits removed from their posts, apprehensions which hadbeen expressed regarding the damage to our prestige and the effect upon the national temper were probably exaggerated. Much thatwas revealed in the Report had already appeared, in one forfia or another, in the Press, and the public consequently had, to someextent, been prepared for the shock they would undoubtedlyexperience.The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the Meeting and to continue the discussion on thefollowing day, in order to give Mr. Balfour and general smuts an opportunity of studying the Report and connectedpapers.It was further decided that Any questions on this subject in the Houses of parliament should be postponed until Wednesday, the 3 3th June.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 11, 1917.o
