THE War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on the-subject of the Report of the Mesopotamian Commission.They had before them the opinion of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, to the effect that it was regrettable that the report should be published during the war, having regard to the reflectionswhich it contained on many high officials, and on the manner inwhich the operations were planned and conducted ; and the view ofthe Admiralty that, so far as the possible disclosure&apos; of navalinformation is concerned, they see no objection to the publication ofthe report.[1365-156]B
in view of the terms of Section 6 of The Special Commission(Dardanelles and Mesopotamia) Act, 1916, the War Cabinet were ofopinion that there was practically no option in regard to the publica-tion, subject to such excisions as might be considered necessary inthe public interest.It was agreed, however, that the evidence ought not to bepublished.The War Cabinet decided, however, that It might be necessary to accompany the publication of thereport by a statement of the action to be taken by theGovernment on the various questions raised, and that further time was required to enable them to decide thenature of this action.It was further decided that In the event of pressure in Parliament for immediate publication,a reply should be given in the sense that the Governmenthad the matter under consideration in consultation withthe appropriate Departments, and that an early decision will be given.Salonica. 2. With reference to War Cabinet ] 55, Minute 5, the WarCabinet approved the terms of a letter from the Prime Minister toM. Ribot (Appendix).It was decided that--This letter should be sent out by a selected Messenger, who could explain the circumstances to such members of theFrench Government as he might meet, the regret of theBritish Government at having to take this decision, but their firm intention to adhere to it.Italy and Asia 3. The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked the minor. authority of the War Cabinet to inform the Italian ambassador that we should not insist on the &quot;further effort&quot; imposed by theWar Cabinet as a condition of acceptance of the proposal of theConference at St. Jean de Maurienne.The War Cabinet decided that The question should be discussed in full as soon as the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff could be present.Air said. 4. The Director of Military Operations gave particulars regardingthe Air Raid on the previous day on Shoeburyness and Sheerness,during which our casualties amounted to 12 killed (including 8civilians) and 3(! wounded. Beyond the setting on fire of a NavalStore at Sheerness there was no serious damage. Two enemyaeroplanes had been brought down by gunfire. The enemy&apos;sobjective appeared to be the Sheerness Dockyard. There was little doubt that our aeroplanes had prevented the enemy from penetratingfurther inland.The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that on their return journey the enemy aeroplanes, including some that had beensent up by the enemy to reinforce the raiders on their return, were attacked by ten of our machines at Dunkirk, when two more of thehostile aeroplanes were destroyed and four were driven down out ofcontrol.It was stated that there is nothing to prevent a fleet of, say, fiftyaeroplanes coming to London, as London must he regarded as being

The Director of Military Operations reported that there was serious trouble, practically amounting to mutiny, in a number ofFrench regiments, partly as the result of Socialistic propaganda, partly on the ground that native troops had been allowed to fire on strikersin the neighbourhood of Paris. It was hoped that this disaffectionwould be set right in five or six days.Attack on Ostend.Submarines.j3. With reference to War Cabinet 154, Minute 17, the Deputy-Chief of the Naval Staff gave particulars of the damage done atOstend; workshops had been destroyed, jetties injured, and severalvessels sunk.7. The Deputy-Chief of the Naval Staff made his usual state-ment in regard to losses caused by submarines. He stated thatduring May twenty-six vessels (106.000 tons) had been lost in the^Mediterranean, whilst seventy-eight British vessels (213,000 tons)had been lost elsewhere.SecretarialArrangeriients forthe eventual PeaceConference.8. The War Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary(Paper G.T.-938) asking for authority to work out detailedsecretarial arrangements for the eventual Peace Conference, in orderthat, whether that Conference takes place within months or years,the more mechanical details necessary to the efficient service of theBritish delegates might be thought out.It was decided, however, that- -No action in this direction should be taken yet, as, in thepresent phase of the war, it is considered undesirable totake any steps which might create a peace atmosphere orgive the impression that the Government were makingpreparations for a Peace Conference.Proposed Ministryof Health.9. The War Cabinet had before them the following documentsdealing with the proposal for a Ministry of Health : (a.) Report of Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee.(b.) Memorandum by Sir Edwin Cornwall on (a), dated the^18th May, 1917.(c.) Memorandum by Lord Milner (Paper G.T.-839).Sir Edwin Cornwall developed the arguments set forth in his memorandum, in which he agreed that the Health organisation ofthe country should be established on a sounder and more effectivebasis than at present, but expressed his view that it would be a grave mistake to proceed on the lines proposed by the Sub-Committeoon Public Health, which would involve the break-up of the existing organisation of National Health Insurance.The President of the Local Government Board urged that public opinion was strongly in favour of the new proposals. Hoinsisted that no break-up of the existing National Health organisa-tion was contemplated, as Sir E. Cornwall appeared to apprehend.The scheme was to amalgamate the Local Government Board landthe English and Welsh National Insurance Commissions in a single.Ministry of Health.Dr. Addison urged the importance of taking action during thewar, particularly in view of the extent to which soldiers were already1365-156]B 2
taking up the hospital and sanatorium accommodation provided under the National Insurance Acts. He also laid stress on the factthat the existing organisation for National Insurance, including thevarious Approved Societies, would not be materially altered, but would continue their separate existence as part of a much largerorganisation designed to promote national health in all its aspects.The Secretary for Scotland stated that the proposals made would affect Scotland as well, but that he had not yet had anopportunity of consulting the Scottish Boards which would be concerned.Having regard to the large volume of public opinion in favourof the proposals for a Ministry of Health, the War Cabinet, thoughrecognising that ultimately the contributory character of the present scheme might be affected, were inclined to favour in principle theestablishment of a Ministry of Health. They felt, however, that before taking a decision they required more information as to theattitude of the Approved Societies towards the change, and how they would be affected by the proposals.It was agreed that The Prime Minister, in company with the members of the Sub-Committee, should receive a deputation from the JointCommittee of the Approved Societies and the ExecutiveCommittee of the National Approved Societies as proposed at their meeting held on the 21st May, at the office of theNational Amalgamated Approved - Society (the &quot; national insurance Gazette,&quot; 2nd June, 1917), and that the Secre-tary for Scotland should meantime make the necessaryenquiries with regard to the Scottish aspect of thequestion.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 6, 1917.
APPENDIX.Letter from the Prime Minister to M. Ribot.My dear M. Ribot,! June 6, 1917.THE War Cabinet have been deeply concerned by a number of serious reports which they have received about the recent offensive operations on the Salonicafront reports which reflect very gravely on the fitness of General Sarrail for the command-in-chief of the great force which is there.It has been part of the Allied strategy that early this spring offensive operations should be undertaken upon the Salonica front, and so far as we can ascertain it was generally agreed among all competent judges upon the spot that with proper leadershipthere was an excellent opportunity of dealing a heavy blow at the enemy. Yet theoperations appear to have been a complete fiasco.According to the reports which we have received from our representatives, theresult was due to no want of courage or determination on the part of the troopsengaged, but entirely to failure on the part of the higher command. There does notappear to have been any properly concerted plan of campaign, or any proper contact between General Sarrail and the armies under his command; the offensive seems tohave consisted of a number of isolated operations, neither properly co-ordinated noradequately supported, and to have been conducted without any attempt to press home the advantages gained.The War Cabinet finds that these reports are fully borne out by the information which they have received from the Italians, the Russians, and the Serbs. It would further seem from these reports that General Sarrail, after more than a year and a halfin command, has entirely lost the confidence of the Allied troops entrusted to his care.In these circumstances, the War Cabinet have come to the conclusion that theyare not justified in continuing to leave the very large British forces in the Balkansunder General Sarrail&apos;s command.Speaking for myself, I must say that it is with the deepest regret I write in this sense. As you know, I have by no means been an opponent of General Sarrail. I wasfavourably impressed by him when we met in Rome, and I have on more than one occasion defended him in order that he might have every chance of carrying out thepolicy which was then agreed upon. And I wish to recognise without reserve the loyalty with which he has observed the pledges which he gave. But after reading the reports we have received, and making full further enquiries, I entirely concur with theWar Cabinet that we should not be justified in leaving the British forces in the Balkansunder the supreme command of General Sarrail.We sincerely hope that the French Government will recognise the necessity for theappointment of another General in place of General Sarrail, and will issue immediateinstructions to some competent officer on the spot to take over the command until thenew Commander-in-Chief can arrive.Yours sincerely,D. LLOYD GEORGE.o
