Cabinet that at Ypres the Germans had only gained 200-300 yardsby their recent counter-attack and that we were still in occupationof a part of Inverness Copse. As regards our casualties, they had been  moderate. Since the 16th August, on the Ypres front they hadamounted to approximately 5,000, whilst on the Lens front, fromthe 15th August Canadian casualties amounted to about 7,000. Inour recent action at Hargicourt we only had 500 casualties and hadtaken 140 prisoners.(The Director of Military Operations stated that the object of operations such as that at Hargicourt was to prevent the germans from further weakening their front and sending troops to relievetheir hardly-pressed positions in the vicinity of Ypres and Lens.
Western Front: 2. The Director of Military Operations stated that the FrenchFrench Sphere. were doing very well, and, as regards the high ground in the vicinity of Verdun, had taken all of it with the exception of one of theBeaumont Heights, also that they had advanced further than hadbeen their intention at the start of the operation.Italian Front. 3. Major-General Maurice informed the War Cabinet that the news from the Italian front was excellent, and that the Second army was in possession of the greater portion of the Bainsizza Plateau, theportions not yet in their hands being a part of the centre and a portion of the southern area. He stated that the Monte SantoHeight had been gained by an encircling movement and that thesame procedure was being carried out at Monte St. Gabrieli andMonte Danielo. The prisoners captured up to the evening ofthe 25th, were 28,000, with over 100 guns, some of which were12-inch.   The Austrians claim to have captured 8,000 Italians.Sir John Jellicoe reported that British monitors had renderedeffective co-operation in the further advance of the Italians.Mesopotamia. 4. Major-General Maurice stated that information had beenreceived from General Maude to the effect that the RussianCommander-in-Chief would not be able to advance for some considerable time. As the Turks might be strongly establishedbefore the Russian advance could take place, the Director of MilitaryOperations was of opinion that the Russians might have considerabledifficulty in advancing to the Dialha.Salonica. 5. with reference to War Cabinet 221, Minute 5, the WarCabinet had under consideration G.T.-1848, which containedtelegrams between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff andGeneral Officer Commanding at Salonica regarding the relief ofBritish troops. These telegrams indicated that the British frontwas 144 kilometres, of which 27 kilometres were only lightly held;the Serbian front consisted of 55 kilometres, French front of 80,Italian front of 15, and the Russian front of 36 kilometres, theGreek Army being interpolated with the French. This meant thaton the British front, of 117 kilometres, there were 59 british battalions against 93 of the enemy, and on the remaining Alliedfront of 186 kilometres, 208 battalions of the Allies against 140battalions of the enemy.Major-General Maurice pointed out that the French had beenwithdrawing some of their battalions, that their battalions had notbeen maintained at full strength by the necessary drafts being dispatched from France, and, furthermore, that they had withdrawnno less than 20,000 of their troops and sent them on leave to France.Such being the case, it was not difficult to understand whyGeneral Sarrail said it was impossible for him at the presentmoment to take over any of the British line, which was nowinadequately manned.The Director of Military Operations read a draft telegram hehad prepared for transmission to the French Government on the.subject, and the War Cabinet decided that The telegram should be more strongly worded in certain respectsby the War Office, and forwarded to the Foreign Office for transmission to the French Government.
23Serbia.Italy :proposed conference inSeptember.7. With reference to War Cabinet 217, Minute 12, the Directorof Military Operations stated that in view of the Italian offensive and the fact that when it was over General Cadorna would haveto proceed to Rome and afterwards carry out important inspectionson the Trentino front, it would be impossible for him to attend aConference in Paris during the month of September.BritishAmmunitionSituation:Italian Front.8. In reply to enquiries relative to the expenditure of gun ammunition by the British batteries on the Italian front, Major-General Furse informed the War Cabinet that the situation was entirely satisfactory, and that during the last feu&apos; days the expendi-ture had been considerably reduced. He stated -that, before the offensive began, the number of rounds available was 118,000, andthat 7G,000 were now left; 7,000 should arrive in Italy to-day, anda further 40,000 will be sent off this week.International 9. With reference to War Cabinet 217, Minute 1:2, the First-Naval Conference. Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that Admiral Mavo, Com-mander-in-Chief of the United States Atlantic Fleet, was arrivingto-day with a view to attending the Naval Conference on the4th September. He added that no reply had yet been receivedfrom the French, Italian, and Russian Governments to the invitationfor their representatives to attend.Submarine Action. 10. The First Sea Lord reported that submarine &quot; E 34 &quot; had sunk a German steamer off the Texel, and that a report had beenreceived from Devonport to the effect that an armed trawler had reported having engaged and sunk a submarine on the 24th instantabout 40 miles south of the Lizard, the submarine being hit three times, and sinking slowly, leaving yellow vapour over the spot.The First Sea Lord added that the French fleet messenger&quot; Giola II &quot; had been sunk by a submarine in the vicinity of theIonian Islands.Air Baid. 11. Sir   John Jellicoe   reported   that  information had beenreceived from Dunkirk that an air raid had been carried out on the aerodromes, &amp;c, at St. Denis West-rein, and that 4 tons of bombs had been dropped.Eussia: Biga. 12. The First Sea Lord reported that a Russian destroyer hadbeen sunk by seaplanes in the vicinity of the Gulf of Riga, and thatthere was no indication of any other naval offensive by the germans in that vicinity.Transport ofLiberatedPrisoners fromArchangel.13. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note from theForeign Office (G.T.-1846; forwarding a letter from the italian ambassador in London as to the transport from Archangel to theUnited Kingdom of certain liberated prisoners who are natives of italian-speaking provinces of Austria-Hungary.6. In continuation of the preceding Minute, Lord Pt. Cecd drew attention to a telegram that had been received, indicating that the moral of the Serbian troops was in not too good a state, and that itwas highly desirable that they should be given a rest. The WarCabinet decided that  Lord R. Cecil should repeat this telegram to the british ambassador in Paris and request him to impress uponthe French Government the seriousness of the situation asregards Serbian troops.
The First Sea Lord pointed out that the date of the letter fromthe Italian Ambassador was 14th August, but that on the20th August the Italian Naval Attache had been informed by theSecretary of the Admiralty that it was regretted that, after very careful consideration by the Ministry of Shipping and the Admiralty,it was not found possible to transport the men in question. It waspointed out that we are having the greatest difficulty in transporting -soldiers who were absolutely necessary and efficient for the purposeof war, and the transport of these men, who had been prisoners, andwho, it was understood, were only to be used for labour units, couldonly be carried out by keeping in Russia a similar number of efficient soldiers who were urgently required elsewhere.Committee on 14. The War Cabinet had before them certain correspondenceAerial Operations: (G.T.-1845) embodying a memorandum from the Field-MarshalReturn of No. 46 Commanding-in-Chief urging that No. 4.6 Squadron R.F.C., whichSquadron R.F.C. to had been sent to England the previous month in order to strengthenFrance. ^fog home aerial defence, should be returned at once to France.The War Cabinet were reminded that at their meeting of the19th July, 1917, they had decided (War Cabinet 190, Minute 16)to approve the recommendations contained in the first report of thePrime Ministers Committee (G.T.-1451). The report had recom-mended that one squadron should be sent back at once from France,and that three additional aerial squadrons should be raised for homedefence ; the question of the release of the squadron from France tobe reconsidered when the above three squadrons were complete in all respects. Sir Douglas Haig accordingly released No. 46 Squadronto assist in the defence of London.General Shaw said that, in the opinion of the Field-marshal commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, five squadrons were necessaryto ensure adequate protection to the London area from hostile air raids.Major-General Brancker reported that three squadrons were in process of completion, but that one was three machines and anothersix below strength. He hoped that all three would be complete inthe course of the next three weeks. Progress had, however, been delayed owing to heavy casualties at the front and the necessity of replacing wastage with the least possible delay during the presentoffensive, and also to some extent by &quot;munition workers&apos; holidays.It was nointed out that a decision involved the acceptance ofone of two alternative risks. The Germans had withdrawn largenumbers of aircraft from the French and Russian fronts in order to concentrate on the British front, where both sides were using then-utmost endeavours to obtain air supremacy during the importantbattle now proceeding, the upshot of which might possibly be decisive in character. To deny to Sir Douglas Haig any possible assistance was to endanger the maintenance of his superiority in theair. Aircraft at the front were in perpetual combat with the enemy,whereas air raids on England were of infrequent occurrence. Onthe other hand, the defence of London, the nerve-centre of theEmpire, demanded exceptional measures, and to weaken the aerialdefences of the Metropolis might lay it open to a raid on a big scale which might have serious moral and material results.The view generally held by the naval and military expertssummoned for consultation was that, while it was impossible toensure complete immunity for the London area from hostile raids,we were in a much better position to meet such raids than we were at the time of the last raid on London on the 7th July even if the46th Squadron was withdrawn. The three almost complete squadronsshould, in existing circumstances, be adequate to secure protection for London and its more vulnerable environs against such an attackas was made on the 7th July.
American Attitude 15. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum to the War. from the Director of Information (G.T.-1802) on the Americanattitude to the war, in which it was pointed out that the american people were not yet fully awake to the gravity of the situation, andthat the best means to educate them and secure their better co-operation would be to invite the United States Congress to send as many representatives as may be willing to come to visit this country,France, and Belgium, so as to be brought personally into touch withthe work in progress behind the lines and on the fighting fronts, &amp;c.The War Cabinet requested The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to consult theAmerican Ambassador as to the desirability of issuing ajoint invitation from Great Britain, France, and Italy,and desired Lord Robert Cecil, in the event of Mr. Pageconcurring, to ask the French and Italian Governments tojoin us in sending an invitation to members of the UnitedStates Congress to come over as the guests of the AlliedGovernments to visit this country and the French, Belgian,and Italian fronts.Pope&apos;s Peace 16. In continuation of War Cabinet 221 Minute 8, Lord RobertProposal. Cecil drew the attention of the War Cabinet to a telegram form colonel House to Sir Eric Drummond (Appendix) dated the25th August, in which it was stated that the President had composedan answer to the Pope&apos;s peace overtures and would probably send it within a few days.Lord Robert Cecil stated that he had requested that a copy ofthe proposed answer should be telegraphed for the information ofthe British Government.The War Cabinet decided that Pending its receipt no further action could be taken, and requested Lord Robert Cecil, if any fresh developmentsarose, to communicate the same immediately, so that aWar Cabinet Meeting could be arranged, if requisite.Support to Italy. 17. The Director of Military Operations stated that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff had received a letter from the PrimeMinister, asking him to consider as an urgent matter the question ofrendering ^ assistance in the shape of&quot; further batteries to theItalians with a view to ensuring the gain of a decisive victory overthe Austrian armies on the Carso-Isonzo front.The Director of Military Operations reported that he had[1365-224] CThe Director of Military Operations referred to the requestreceived by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff from Sir douglas haig again pressing for the return of No. 46 Squadron, and in viewof the present position of aerial defences at home and the anxioussituation at the front, he urged the paramount claims of the expeditionary Force to the squadron which had only been temporarilyreleased.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) No. 46 Squadron should be returned at once to France as requested.(6.) The Director of Military Operations should inform sir douglas Haig without delay of their decision.(c.) The Secretary should communicate this decision to lord french, and ask him to make the necessary arrangements in concert with the War Office.
discussed the question with the Chief of the Imperial General Staffon the 24th instant, and the views of the latter were briefly asfollows : (a.) For the purpose of the present situation, the operations onthe Western front and on the Isonzo-Carso front mustbe considered as one. There was no doubt that thesuccess of the French effort at Verdun and that of theItalians on the Eastern front bad been directly due toour offensive at Ypres and Lens, which had obliged theGermans to concentrate a very large number of theirdivisions against us. Many of these divisions had been drawn away from opposition to the French, and none hadbeen available to send as reinforcements to help the austrians.(6.) The only way by which we could assist the Italians with asufficient number of guns to have an effective result was by withdrawing them from the Ypres operations. Ifguns in any number were so withdrawn from our frontit would be not less than a month before they would bein action on the Italian front, by which time a decisions would have been reached, and the guns would have been of no service to anyone.(c.) If we sent the guns we should have to cease our offensive on the Western front, as Sir Douglas Haig, in view ofthe concentration of force against him in guns as well asin men, required every gun he could procure, and could with advantage utilise many more.(d.)jTo abandon our offensive at this stage would be disastrousfor the moral of our troops, and would amount to aGerman victory.(e.) If we ceased our offensive the Germans would be able toassist the Austrians before we could do so, as they hadfive lines of rails available for transport purposes againsttwo of ours.. (/.) It was improbable that the French could afford to send any considerable number of guns to the Italians, seeing thatthey had had to transfer guns from the Chemin desDames in order to provide the guns necessary for theirVerdun offensive, and these again would have to betransferred if subsequent operations were to be undertaken on the Chemin des Dames.(g.) General Foch was also of opinion, and it had been accepted as a principle that no change in our plans was possible before next spring.(Ii.) The Italians had a considerable superiority in guns, butGeneral Cadorna had experienced some anxiety as to hisammunition supply on the 23rd August. Then the attack of one of his;Armies had failed and the progress of theother had not developed. Since the 23rd the action ofthe Italian 2nd Army had tended to become one of movement, and the expenditure of ammunition was howless and would probably continue to be less than in theopening bombardment, more particularly as the Austrianshad lost over 100 guns.Major-General Furse strongly endorsed the opinion of Major-General Maurice that our correct policy should be to press our ownoffensive to the greatest extent, which would really afford the mostdirect assistance to the Italians.During the discussion a telegram was received from the british ambassador at Borne indicating that the Austrians were urgentlyappealing to the Germans for help, and were withdrawing manyof their own troops from the Russian front.
The War Cabinet decided To resume the discussion on the following afternoon, and directedthe Secretary to ask the Prime Minister what time itwould be convenient to attend; they further desiredMajor-General Maurice to arrange for the Chief of theImperial General Staff to be present.They requested Major-General Furse in the meantime tocommunicate with the Italian headquarters and obtain astatement of the Italian ammunition position for considera-tion at to-morrow&apos;s meeting.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 27, 1917.APPENDIX.Paraphrase of Telegram from Colonel House to Sir Eric Drummond. (Received6 p.m., August 25, 1917.)WITH regard to the Pope&apos;s peace overtures, the President has composed an answer which will serve, I think, to unite Russia, and add to the confusion of Germany.The answer will probably be sent off in the next few days. In my opinion, if theAllied Governments could see their way to accept it as their answer to the Pope, itwould strengthen their cause throughout the world. Further, the President has, in his reply, struck the note necessary to make the people of the United States of Americaa united people, so that they may put forth their maximum effort.
