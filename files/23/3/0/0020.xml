Shipping Allotted 1. The War Cabinet approved  the  recommendations   of aExpeditions Report prepared by General Smuts at the request of the CabinetoXdeFrance. Committee on War Policy (Paper G.T.-1180, Appendix I) withthe exception of recommendation (o) dealing with the transfer of australian, New Zealand, and South African troops from theWestern Front to Mesopotamia and Palestine.At the request of the Secretary of State for War, the WarCabinet agreed to defer decision on this point until the return *ofthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Mr. Long pointed out the bad effect on recruiting in theDominions that might be caused by stopping their troops fromcoming to England. In this connection he reminded the WarCabinet that, in connection with demobilisation, the Governments ofthe Dominions had laid some stress on the importance of oppor-tunities for their troops to visit this country before their return home. He added that, if it were finally decided to adopt Recom-mendation (b), the War Office might frame and submit to theColonial Office for transmission a telegram setting out the military reasons which made so undesirable a step necessary.With regard to Recommendation (d), which was accepted inprinciple, the Secretary of State for War said that the WarOffice would do everything possible towards establishing hospital accommodation in Mesopotamia in order to reduce the number ofvessels now employed as hospital ships between Basra and Bombay.In connection with Recommendation (e), the Secretary of Statefor War stated that, at a Conference on the previous day on thequestion of railway material (War Cabinet 170, Minute 2), sufficientprogress had been made to justify approval to the agreement reached with the French in regard to the development of the Taranto route.The War Cabinet asked The Secretary of State for War to send a telegram to the FrenchGovernment notifying them to that effect.The War Cabinet asked General Smuts to continue to watch the developments inrespect of the points dealt with in Paper G.T.-1180, and,later on, to make a further report.Conveyance of 2. The War Cabinet had before them copies of correspondenceHorses from between the War Office and the Ministry of Shipping in regard toAustralia to India     tonnage for  the  conveyance  of horses from Australia  to India(Paper G.T.-1129).The Secretary of State for War explained that the horses were required for use in India, Mesopotamia, and possibly Egypt in thewinter of 1918-19. It was necessary to make arrangements for transport now, in order that the animals might be shipped this winter and become acclimatised before the following one. Otherwiseexperience had shown that the wastage would be excessive.Sir Leo Money pointed out the other essential and immediatedemands upon shipping, and stated that if tonnage were allocated for the conveyance of these animals from Australia there would bea loss of carrying power equivalent to 400,000 tons of cargo. Tenships allotted to Australia were equal to thirty ships fetching food from Ameiica.The Quartermaster-General, on the other hand, said that unlessthe animals were shipped the cavalry in India, Mesopotamia, and egypt could not be kept up to strength during 1918-19. He read a letter from the Quartermaster-General in India, who reportedthat the local supplies of animals in that country had been &quot; suckeddry.&quot;
Tonnage for Horses 3. The larger question of tonnage for horses for all purposesGenerally. and theatres of war was raised in a letter from the Ministry of&quot;Shipping (Appendix II).Mr. Graeme Thomson pointed out that the aggregate require-ments of the War Office in respect of tonnage for animals involved an increase of twenty-five large steamers, in addition to those already in use.(This question was postponed for further discussion pendingthe Report of the War Policy Committee.;Dutch Exports ofAgriculturalProduce to theUnited Kingdomand Germany.4. The War Cabinet had under consid-ration memoranda bythe Foreign Office (Paper G.T.-1103) and by the First Sea Lord(Paper G.T.-1179).Mr. Leverton Harris stated that we have an agriculturalagreement with Holland whereby the Dutch have to offer us 12,000tons of potatoes before they can export any to Germany. So farthey had not offered this quantity, and he understood that they are proposing to send 55,000 tons to Germany, and it is likely that theymay break their agreement with us at any moment. There were several ways by which pressure could be put on Holland, such as the withholding- of bunker arrangements, the refusal of cable facilities,and the prevention of certain exports to Dutch East Indies and the stoppage of imports into Holland. He pointed out that the difficultyof bringing Dutch exports to this country was due to lack oftonnage and escort.Sir Leo Money said that it was a mistake to suppose that theShipping Controller had purposely reduced shipping facilities ; onthe contrary, he was anxious to increase them ; and, in view of the double object of (a) getting food for this country from a near source of supply, and (6) keeping food away from the enemy, he urged thatsome risks should be taken.The War Cabinet decided that The Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping should confer witha view to more convoys and an increase of tonnage in theDutch trade.With regard to the nature of the pressure (if any) that shouldbe put upon Holland, the War Cabinet decided that This question should wait until Mr. Balfour and Lord robert cecil had expressed their views.The Eecruitmentof Native labour in India.5. With reference to War Cabinet 150, Minute 21, the WarCabinet discussed the question of recruiting labotir in India, raisedby G.T.-1010 and G.T.-1195.The Secretary of State for India asked for instructions as towhat message he should communicate to the Viceroy.Mr. Graeme Thomson said that a large part of the space inthe vessels conveying the coolies to M irseilles would be otherwiseunoccupied, so that the economy of tonnage involved was not great.The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested that theGovernment of Australia should be asked to make an effort to supply the tonnage, and the War Cabinet accordingly directed that The Secretary of State for the Colonies should, in concert withthe Secretary of State for War, send a telegram to theCommonwealth Government making a strong appeal to themto provide the tonnage required for the conveyance of animals to India out of the supply of ships which theyhave in their possession.
The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for War should consider whether hecan dispense with Chinese labourers and replace them by-Indians ; and, if so, whether he can thereby replaceBritish labour and prisoner labour in France which is urgently required at home.(b.) It was undesirable in principle to employ Indian labour inthis country, having regard to labour objections; any action to the contrary would be taken only on theresponsibility of the Minister of Labour, as laid down by war Cabinet 168, Minute 2. .(c.) The Secretary of State for India should act on the requisitionof the Secretary of State for War ; in the meanwhile heshould telegraph to the Viceroy to hold up recruiting,but to retain the machinery of recruitment.(cZ.) The Admiralty should confer with the War Office in regardto the necessary escort from India.The Western 6. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that the&apos;British*ront- line had been advanced on a front of 2 miles in the Souchez area,occupying the outskirts of Avion ; thirty-five prisoners had been captured. He pointed out that, while this advance did not give uscontrol of the Lens-Arras Railway, it was a step towards it.The Austrian 7. The Director of  Military Intelligence reported that the communique. Austrians, in their communique, claimed the capture of&quot; MonteOrtigara; 1,800 prisoners; 53 machine guns; 7 guns; and 2,000rifles. In the Italian communique these captures were not mentioned,but it was stated that the Italians had not reoccupied certainpositions on the summit of the mountain, which had been completely destroyed by the enemy&apos;s fire.Spain. 8. The Director of Military Intelligence reported the receipt ofa telegram from the IS aval Intelligence Officer at Gibraltar by theD.I.D., Admiralty, to the effect that a railway strike is timed to takeplace in Spain on the 1st Juty, to be followed by a revolution on the2nd July, and that public feeling is running high.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had seenthis telegram on the previous day, when the question arose as towhether we ought to telegraph to Spain on the subject. He inclined to the view that it was better not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country&apos;. It was pointed out, however, that itmight be regarded as an unfriendly act not to give a friendly power the information received.The War Cabinet decided that The question of communicating on this subject with the SpanishGovernment should be left to the decision of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, who, it was arranged, should see  the  Director  of the  Intelligence  Division of the. Admiralty that afternoon.The Eastern 9. With reference to War Cabinet 169, Minute 6, the DirectorEiont. 0f Military Intelligence reported that no definite news had beenreceived from the Russian front in regard to the intended offensive.One report stated that the offensive had been postponed for two weeks ; on the other hand, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that a report had been received at the Foreign Office to theeffect that the offensive had begun already.
WC 172Submarines. 10. The First Sea Lord made his usual statement in regard tosubmarine activity. The destroyer &quot;Talisman&quot; claimed to have sunk one submarine, and the transport &quot; Celia &quot; another. TheFrench cruiser &quot; Kleher&quot; had been sunk by a mine at the entrance to Brest harbour on the 27th June.Bombardment 11. The First Sea Lord reported that the enemy had bombardedot Dunkirk. Dunkirk at a range of 47,000 yards with a 15-inch gun mounted* in rear of the German lines.   The British had retaliated by a long-range bombardment of Ostend.Sinking of a ^e First Sea Lord stated that the British   submarineGerman Aleiehaut &quot;E. 41,&quot; which had been engaged in mine-laying off the Frisianship. coast, bad sighted two German merchant ships travelling under escort,and had sunk one of them. This had been done under Admiraltyorders to sink at sight any vessel in those waters presumed to beGerman.Indian Eeforms. 13. The War Cabinet bad under consideration the question of. certain political and administrative reforms which it might be advisable and necessary to introduce in the present system ofgovernment in India. The subject bad been broadly reviewed incertain papers which were before them, notably two memoranda bythe Secretary of State for India and Lord Curzon respectively.(Papers G.T.-822 and G.T.-1199.)The Secretary of State for India said that the present situation was causing grave anxiety, which was felt equally by himself andthe Indian Government. The question had been raised by thatGovernment in their despatch No. 17, dated the 24th November,1916. The position, as it presented itself to him, was briefly asfollows : He had been for some time past convinced that, apartfrom the war, certain changes or developments were inevitable.He had been much impressed by the rapidity with which eventswere moving in India, and by the accelerated progress of thought in that country. There was a rapid surface currentof educated political feeling, which might be confined at present to a small but very vocal and not uninfluential class, butthis feeling was bound to permeate to the hitherto unstirred deepsbelow. The great masses might not be sentient or articulate, butthey could not remain long unaffected. The feeling of national self-consciouness was being awakened. The National Congress and the. Moslem League were uniting forces, and their combined activities and aspirations could not be safely ignored. There was a largesection of educated men who were growing more and more sensitiveabout their treatment by the Government, who felt acutely theirdependent and subservient position, and who were ambitious tohave some participation in the administration of the country. Thewiser and more moderate members of this section realised that progressmust be gradual, but even the most loyal of them had represented that unless His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to come forward at once and declare publicly that their ultimate aim distantthough the realisation of that aim might be was self-govern-ment in a form that would be both acceptable to moderate opinion and suitable to the special conditions of India, the moderate party would have either to efface themselves or join the extremists. The Government of India in their despatch had suggested the form which, in their opinion, such a declaration might take, but its phraseology bore the marks of many hands, and suggestedthat from a divergence of views a compromise had emerged; theformula itself was too elaborate, and would not meet with wideacceptance or give general satisfaction; concessions were stultified[995-3] C
by restrictions. The Indian Government had repeatedly pressed fora declaration of policy, as their present embarrassment was shared by all the heads of the various Provinces, who, in order to allaylocal unrest, were compelled to make statements of a temporisingcharacter which might not always be mutually reconcilable.Mr. Chamberlain proceeded to indicate the practical steps whichhe suggested might be taken to meet the powerful and increasing demand for a greater share by Indians in the administration oftheir country. There should be, he thought, a development of the minor institutions of local Governments. But, in addition,ilargerpolitical changes were necessary. In the opinion of the indian government the approach to self-government might be made by increasing the number of elected members of the Provincial Councils,and by considerable changes in the electoral system. The Councils,he said, have at present a certain control over finance, but the elected members had no more responsibility than a party in the House ofCommons, which is so small in numbers as never to be likely to hold office. The real desideratum was devolution of power and responsi-bility, in such restricted spheres as might be possible, e.g., in questions affecting public works and sanitation, with control over expenditure under these heads and some limited powers of taxation for them.Mr. Chamberlain felt that he lacked sufficient experience to formulate a policy himself. A strong Committee of his Council atthe Tndia Office had assembled, under his orders, to examine theproposals put forward by the Indian Government, and they had reported that, in their view, the matter had not been adequatelythreshed out, and that public opinion in India had not been sufficiently consulted. The Committee did not believe that theproposals would satisfy Indian opinion that they were in themselvessound. They accordingly recommended that a small commissioner Committee should be appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government to conduct an enquiry into the whole question. They would first sit in London and then go. out to India; they need not be absent for more than two or three months; and while in India, they would confer with the Viceroy and his Council, they would see repre-sentatives of the elected members of Councils, as well as of more moderate and conservative sections and classes. They would go outwith an open and receptive mind, and they would be under no obligation to record all the evidence placed before them.This suggestion bad been referred to the Indian Government,who had deprecated the idea, of a Commission, which they seemed toconsider must necessarily take the form of a large body sitting in public, like the Public Services Commission. They had expressedthe hope that it might be possible for the Secretary of Statehimself to proceed to India and personally to investigate theposition. This course might appreciably allay the presentagitation, and would certainly impress the Indian peoples withthe serious view taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government of theirfeelings and aspirations. Mr. Chamberlain said that he had contemplated the possibility of accepting the Viceroy&apos;s invita-tion if the War Cabinet desired him to undertake this mission,but he thought that he ought first to resign the post of Secretary ofState. As regards the constitution of the Commission, he considered,it desirable that it should not consist of more than five or six members, all of whom should be selected on account of their experience in the affairs of countries other than India; they shouldtie men of liberal views, of high standing, impartial, and of establishedreputation. It might seem, at first sight, advisable that agentleman of Indian birth should form one of their number.This, however, would inevitably arouse jealousy and discord, asevery important community in India would then wish to be repre-sented, e.g., the Mahommedans, the Hindoos, the Paisees,&quot;the Sikhs,and the native Princes. It would be preferable to attach to theCommission two assessors or adjoinis, who might be Sir S. Sinhaand Sir F. W. Duke.   In conclusion, Mr. Chamberlain said that he
sTagreed with Lord Curzon that any concessions now made would hotbe of the nature of rewards for services rendered by India iu thewar, but. would be grauted because, on general grounds, we felt thatthe time for a further advance had arrived. He felt very strongly hisobligation to urge upon the War Cabinet that the present situation,fomented by the Russian revolution and the ideas adopted by theAllies in the war, was grave, and that the moment was ripe for udeclaration of policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The present attitude of the Indian peoples was one of alert expectancy ; and unless the Government were prepared now to make a timely and satisfactory pronouncement, the&apos; situation was fraught with the gravest of possibilities.Lord Curzon said that, speaking as one who had been for nearlyseven years Viceroy of India, and who had had in that capacity to study very closely all questions affecting Indian administration and himself to initiate certain reforms, he thought that the Secretary ofState for India had furnished a wise and comprehensive statement ofthe case. The situation imperatively demanded some advance in thedirection of self-government, but it was impossible to forecast how far the steps they might now decide to take might It ad, or to what extent they would eventually react upon the general prosperity of the Indianpeoples. Action of some kind was inevitable, because the position was serious; the revolutionary activities of propagandists of the genreof Tillak and Mrs. Besant were dangerous, and in the East things were apt to move with the startling rapidity of a prairie fire. Asregards the &quot;goal,&quot; he agreed tnat the formula of the indian government was long, cumbrous, and self-contradictory. He attachedparticular importance to the form which the pronouncement of theirpolicy should take. Educated Indians were past-masters incasuistry, and their criticism of formulte were embarrassing^ subtleand meticulous. Every word of a declaration drawn up by a formerPrime Minister (Lord Derby) for Queen Victoria, and hailed at thetime and ever since as &quot;The Charter of Indian Liberties,&quot; had beenanalysed and cited, often to our disadvantage. He noted thatMr. Chamberlain propo-ed, before making any pronouncement, tosubmit a draft formula for the approval of the War Cabinet, andhe considered that in the circumstances this would be advisable.He further understood that the Secretary of State for Indiaintended to introduce the pronouncement of the government&apos;s policy as an interpolation in the speech he would shortly be makingin Parliament on the Indian Budget. Lord Curzon thought thatany such st itement must be made as impressively as the uniquesituation demanded, and that the utterance of the Secretary of State,if delivered on the occasion suggested, should be invested with appropriate dignity and importance. The problem before the WarCabinet was how to compose the differences, which were not reaifyfundamental in their nature, between the Indian Government andthe India Office. He himself was disposed to accept the views of theSecretary of State, but he thought it was for the Cabinet to discovera bridge between these divergent opinions. Mr. Chamberlain had recommended the institution of a Commission which would sit bothin this country and, later, in India ; which should take evidencebehind closed doors, and not publicly, as had been done in the caseof the Public Services Commission; which should consist of menof entire independence of character and view ; and which should,include, not as members but as ad joints, Sir S. Sinha and sir william Duke. He personally would strongly urge Mr. Chamberlainto charge himself with the duty of investigating the situation onthe spot. Lord Curzon said that, were he himself Viceroyat the present moment, he would welcome the visit of theSecretary of State on such a mission. There would be no questionof his working over the head or behind the back of the Viceroy ;and the invitation in this instance had come from Lord Cbelmsfordhimself.   There need be no derogation of the Viceroy&apos;s position, no
clash or collision of the respective prestige of the two high officials concerned. The precedent of the last Delhi Durbar, which bad-been attended by Lord Crewe, a Secretary of State, was not perhapsstrictly analogous, since the King had been present in person ; but thelate Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, when-Secretary ofState tor the Colonies,had visited South Africa when Lord Milner was High Commissioner,and he was assured by his colleague that no friction or contretempsof any kind had arisen on that occasion ; on the contrary, the most satisfactory results had accrued. Lord Curzon felt convinced that not only was there no necessity for Mr. Chamberlain to resign his present appointment in the event of his being charged withthe mission, but that it was most important that he should go out with all the authority of the Secretary of State forIndia, although persons of high position and independent views might very properly be associated with him. In that event, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be most unlikely to reject the decision at whichhe might arrive ; on the other hand, were another chairman appointed,the War Cabinet would be confronted with the problem of decidingbetween three possibly conflicting views : that of the Indian Govern-ment, that of the India Office, and that of the Commission. Sucha course would not assist to solve, but might conceivably add to, their difficulties. To conclude, Lord Curzon said he felt the Cabinet would agree that some definite advance should be made, and he himselfconcuried in Lord Chelmsford&apos;s view that the best hope of a satis-factory solution lay in Mr. Chamberkin&apos;s acceptance of the Viceroy&apos;invitation.After some discussion as to the proposed personnel of theCommis&amp;ion, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heconcurred in the criticisms made by Lord Curzon of the suggestionsput forward by Mi-. Chamberlain.Mr. Balfour agreed that something had to be done withoutdelay to meet the insistent demands of the educated classes in India,but he thought that, before the War Cabinet came to any conclusion,they should be quite clear in their own minds as to what self-government in India actually connoted. To concede self-govern-ment to that country would be to make India a political unit, whichit never had been. India was still to-day, to all intents and purposes, .a geographical entity, and apparently it was now proposedto convert it into a political unit. Such a unit, in view of theessential differences of race, of thought, and of religion, would bean artificial product. Was it intended to frame a formula that india was to be treated as a potential self-governing unit ?It was surely a great departure from old ideas to take a purely - Western conception and to impose it on a congeries ofOriental communities or races. To hold out such a goal was,in Mr. Balfours opinion, rash in an extreme degree, and, hewould strongly advocate the construction of a formula whichwould not suggest a political self-governing community. It seemedto him to be most.unwise to dangle in the eyes of the expectantmultitudes of India any such position as had been accorded toAustralia or South Africa. In spite of the impact of Westernthought, in an age which was avowedly revolutionary; and in spiteof the increased mental turmoil engendered by the russian revolution, and the feeling in India that her part in the wardemanded adequate recognition, he still felt that the true and the. right ideal was that of gradual self-development leading to a greatershare in local administration under a benevolent, sympathetic, andwuse suzerainty. British government in India was based upon thatsuzerainty, and upon the principles of &quot;justice, impartiality, and efficiency,&quot; and he deprecated any hasty decision to concede to anOriental country a system of self-government which was appropriate and just in the case of the great dominions of the Empire, but was,in his opinion, quite unsuitable to the Dependency.
The discussion was adjourned.   In the meantime The Secretary of State for India undertook to prepare, forconsideration by the War Cabinet, at the earliest opportunity when the Prime Minister would be present,a provisional formula indicating the policy that HisMajesty&apos;s Government intended to adopt in regard to indian administration.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 29, 1917.[995-3]D
APPENDIX LIG.T.-1180. -Shipping allotted to Overseas Expeditions outside France,Interim Report by General Smuts.IN view of the submarine campaign and the urgent necessity to economiseshipping, the Cabinet Committee on War Policy has asked me to investigate thepossibility of reducing the quantity of shipping allotted to overseas expeditions outsideFrance. An Appendix is annexed which shows the allocation of vessels to naval andmilitary services in those expeditions in detail.The War Policy Committee has already authorised the rapid development of theCherbourg-Taranto route, and a draft agreement has been concluded which now onlyawaits the confirmation of the British and French Governments. This route will carryabout 36,000 tons of the naval and military material per month for Salonica and Egypt,leaving about 15,000 tons a-month of such material to be carried by sea route.In addition, the following methods whereby the quantity of shipping allotted tothe above expeditions may be reduced are suggested: 1. Increased rapidity of turn round of Vessels.The Shipping Controller believes that the shipping service on the above routes isnow so efficiently organised and run that, unless the demand for tonnage is curtailed,no reduction of shipping is possible. This state of affairs has been brought aboutlargely through expert inspectors, who have spent months at the principal ports onthese routes and done their best to co-ordinate and speed up the various services.I am convinced that the best results will follow a vigorous and continuous systemof inspection.It is now some months since the shipping experts returned from Salonica and alexandria, and I have therefore arranged that further visits should be made notonly to those ports, but also to Gaza, Basra, Bombay, and East Africa. The ShippingController, who agrees with me in this, has undertaken to despatch highly qualifiedinspectors to these places.2. Using Australian, New Zealand, and South African Drafts in Mesopotamia and egypt instead of sending them to the Western Front.At present drafts are coming from the Dominions to fill up the gaps on theWestern front, while at the same time drafts are being sent from England to repairwastage in Egypt and Mesopotamia. This system seems to involve an unnecessaryamount of transportation.It is suggested that in view of the gravity of the shipping situation and the undesirability of moving drafts to and fro across submarine-infested seas, it may bepossible to use Australian, New Zealand, and South African drafts for service inMesopotamia and Egypt, while the English drafts destined for these campaigns couldbe sent instead to the Western front.The idea, which is approved by the Adjutant-General, is to move cadres of theAustralian, New Zealand, and South&apos; African units from the Western front to mesopotamia and Egypt, whither in future all drafts for those units will proceed. Theeffect will be that these units will gradually be built up afresh in those theatres, whilethe number of Dominion units in France will gradually be diminished.Simultaneously the reverse process will take place with regard to British units which have hitherto proceeded to the distant theatres, and by the beginning of nextyear a more or less complete transfer of these Dominion units will have been effected.The Adjutant-General points out that this arrangement, if initiated during thecoming autumn, would be well-timed, because, roughly speaking, fighting on theWestern front diminishes in activity in November, and, therefore, the stopping of australian drafts in Egypt, on their way westward, would not matter so much fromthe Western point of view. Activity in the East, on the other hand, increases inNovember, and the addition of the Australian units would be opportune.An additional argument in favour of this suggestion is that troops from SouthAfrica, New Zealand, and Australia are better equipped than the English drafts to stand the climate of Palestine and Mesopotamia.
The Adjutant-General awaits the instructions of the War Cabinet beforeauthorising this transfer of units. It would be proper to inform the DominibnGovernments concerned in advance of the intended action and the reasons for it.3. The Development of Local Sources of Supply in the Areas adjacent to Spheres of operation.The Quartermaster-General has issued instructions that all local sources of supplyare to be developed to the utmost. He reports that the prospects in this respect arepromising in Mesopotamia, in the Baghdad Valley, but that they are less so in Salonica.He is, however, communicating with his Overseas representatives again on the subject,and it may be advisable to send expert business men to these distant theatres to explore the question of local purchases.4. Hospital Accommodation on Shore.I have discussed this question with Sir Alfred Keogh and Sir W. Babtie.As regards Salonica and Egypt, the policy of developing hospital accommodationon shore has already been-adopted as far as possibie, and only three military hospital ships are in use. The few cases that have to be evacuated from Salonica can come toEngland by the Tarauto route when that is ready.In connection with the Mesopotamian campaign, there are, however, no fewer than ten hospital ships. The bulk of the evacuation is made to India, where there is adequate accommodation, and I suggest that, in order to save tonnage, a transfer of hospital accommodation should, as far as possibie, be made from India to Mesopotamia.By this means the number of large vessels now employed as hospital ships would bereduced.5. Reduction in Merchant Vessels allocated to the Navy.I had hoped that some reduction both in amount of, and risk to, tonnage mighthave been effected by the use of South African coal carried by the Bed Sea route to tireEastern Mediterranean area of war I am assured, however, by the First Sea Lordthat the South African coal is not suitable for warships. Moreover, 90 per cent, of thecolliers going from this country to the Mediterranean bring back on their return voyageessential cargoes, such as iron ore from Spain and other Mediterranean countries.Some saving in tonnage in the Mediterranean may be made in the following way :There are at Salonica a large number of so-called Fleet messengers; these are smallfast cross-Channel and Irish Channel boats with a speed of about 20 knots.They have been used recently as a screen for the big troopships, thus performingthe work of destroyers.It is now proposed to use some of these small fast boats for the conve3rance oftroops between Taranto and Salonica, through the Corinth Canal, thereby releasing the big troopships which could not in any case have gone through the canal.The First Sea Lord has also given instructions for a re-examination of all thecolliers and smaller vessels in the service of the Admiralty in the East Mediterraneanwith a view to reduction, and I hope to be able to report further on this matter at alater date.Summary.It is impossible at this stage to translate into an exact number of ships the totalresult of the saving obtainable, but if the above proposals are carried into effect theymust yield very considerable economy in tonnage.To sum up, my recommendations are : (a.) That two inspectors of high qualification should be sent to the ports used asbases for the Eastern Expeditions, who should examine the turn-round ofvessels, and report direct to the Shipping Controller. A third inspectorshould be sent from South Africa to East Africa.(6.) That the policy of using troops for service in the theatre of war nearest their homes, in order to save transport, should be pursued as far as possible ;using troops from South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand for palestine and Mesopotamia, and similarly troops&apos;from England and Canada for theWestern front.[995-3] E

This state of affairs has been brought aboutlargely through expert inspectors, who have spent months at the principal ports onthese routes and done their best to co-ordinate and speed up the various services.I am convinced that the best results will follow a vigorous and continuous systemof inspection.It is now some months since the shipping experts returned from Salonica and alexandria, and I have therefore arranged that further visits should be made notonly to those ports, but also to Gaza, Basra, Bombay, and East Africa. The ShippingController, who agrees with me in this, has undertaken to despatch highly qualifiedinspectors to these places.2. Using Australian, New Zealand, and South African Drafts in Mesopotamia and egypt instead of sending tliem to the Western Front.At present drafts are coming from the Dominions to fill up the gaps on theWestern front, while at the same time drafts are being sent from England to repairwastage in Egypt and Mesopotamia. This system seems to involve an unnecessaryamount of transportation.It is suggested that in view of the gravity of the shipping situation and the undesirability of moving drafts to and fro across submarme-infested seas, it may bepossible to use Australian, New Zealand, and South African drafts for service inMesopotamia and Egypt, while the English drafts destined for these campaigns couldbe sent instead to the Western front.The idea, which is approved by the Adjutant-General, is to move cadres of theAustralian, New Zealand, and South&apos; African units from the Western front to mesopotamia and Egypt, whither in future all drafts for those units will proceed. Theeffect will be that those units will gradually be built up afresh in those theatres, whilethe number of Dominion units in France will gradually be diminished.Simultaneously the reverse process will take place with regard to British units which have hitherto proceeded to the distant theatres, and hy the beginning of nextyear a more or less complete transfer of these Dominion units will have been effected.The Adjutant-General points out that this arrangement, if initiated during thecoming autumn, would be well-timed, because, roughly speaking, fighting on theWestern front diminishes in activity in November, and, therefore, the stopping of australian drafts in Egypt, on their way westward, would not matter so much fromthe Western point of view. Activity in the East, on the other hand, increases inNovember, and the addition of the Australian units would be opportune.An additional argument in favour of this suggestion is that troops from SouthAfrica, New Zealand, and Australia are better equipped than the English drafts to stand the climate of Palestine and Mesopotamia.
The Adjutant-General awaits the instructions of the War Cabinet beforeauthorising this transfer of units. It would be proper to inform the DominionGovernments concerned in advance of the intended action and the reasons for it.3. The Development of Local Sources of Supply in the Areas adjacent to Spheres of operation.The Quartermaster-General has issued instructions that all local sources of supjjlyare to be developed to the utmost. He reports that the prospects in this respect arepromising in Mesopotamia, in the Baghdad Valley, but that they are less so in Salonica.He is, however, communicating with his Overseas representatives again on the subject,and it may be advisable to send expert business men to these distant theatres to explore the question of local purchases.4. Hospital Accommodation on Shore.I have discussed this question with Sir Alfred Keogh and Sir W. Babtie.As regards Salonica and Egypt, the policy of developing hospital accommodationon shore has already been-adopted as far as possible, and only three military hospital ships are in use. The few cases that have to be evacuated from Salonica can come toEngland by the Taranto route when that is ready.In connection with the Mesopotarnian campaign, there are, however, no fewer than ten hospital ships. The bulk of the evacuation is made to India, where there is adequate accommodation, and I suggest that, in order to save tonnage, a transfer of hospital accommodation should, as far as possible, be made from India to Mesopotamia.By this means the number of large vessels now employed as hospital ships would bereduced.5. Reduction in Merchant Vessels allocated to the Navy.I had hoped that some reduction both in amount of, and risk to, tonnage mighthave been effected by the use of South African coal carried by the Red Sea route to tiieEastern Mediterranean area of war I am assured, however, by the First Sea Lordthat the South African coal is not suitable for warships. Moreover, 90 per cent, of thecolliers going from this country to the Mediterranean bring back on their return voyageessential cargoes, such as iron ore from Spain and other Mediterranean countries.Some saving in tonnage in the Mediterranean may be made in the following way :There are at Salonica a large number of so-called Fleet messengers; these are smallfast cross-Channel and Irish Channel boats with a speed of about 20 knots.They have been used recently as a screen for the big troopships, thus performingthe work of destroyers.It is now proposed to use some of these small fast boats for the conveyance oftroops between Taranto and Salonica, through the Corinth Canal, thereby releasing the big troopships which could not in a(ny case have gone through the canal.The First Sea Lord has also given instructions for a re-examination of all thecolliers and smaller vessels in the service of the Admiralty in the East Mediterraneanwith a view to reduction, and I hope to be able to report further on this matter at alater date.Summary.It is impossible at this stage to translate into an exact number of ships the totalresult of the saving obtainable, but if the above proposals are carried into effect theymust yield very considerable economy in tonnage.To sum up, my recommendations are : (a.) That two inspectors of high qualification should be sent to the ports used asbases for the Eastern Expeditions, who should examine the turn-round ofvessels, and report direct to the Shipping Controller. A third inspectorshould be sent from South Africa to East Africa.(6.) That the policy of using troops for service in the theatre of war nearest their homes, in order to save transport, should be pursued as far as possible ;using troops from South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand for palestine and Mesopotamia, and similarly troops&apos; from England and Canada for theWestern front.[995-3] E
