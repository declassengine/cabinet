Lord French and 1. THE Secretary of State for War stated that the Field-&quot; John Bull.&quot; Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the Home Forces had drawn his attention to certain articles which had appeared in a recent issue of&apos;: John Bull,&quot; containing violent personal attacks upoii Lord French^and criticising very severely the measures that had been adoptedunder his orders to protect London and its environs against hostileair raids. Lord Derby said that he had read the articles in qirestion,and was inclined to think that he might have to recommend to theWar Cabinet that the Government should institute proceedings against the proprietors of the periodical. He was consulting theLaw Officers through the Treasury Solicitor on the subject, andwould communicate to the War Cabinet their opinion in due course.Prisoners of War. 2. The War Cabinet had before them a note by Lord Newton,dated the 22nd June, 1917 (Paper G.T.-1131), stating that in hisopinion, it was most important that the members of his mission should he instructed immediately as to the line they should adopt ifthe Germans made similar proposals to those which had recentlybeen agreed to by the French. In the course of the discussion itwas again pointed out that the French authorities had apparentlyalready committed themselves to some extent to an agreement ofa far-reaching character without consulting His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and that that Government might be at a serious disadvantageif they attempted to conclude an arrangement on lines similar tothose accepted by the French. It was also suggested that any arrangement which included Austrian prisoners must vitally concern the Italian authorities, whose Government should certainly be consulted before any negotiations with a view to a general exchangecould be finally concluded.The War Cabinet decided To adhere to their decision of the 22nd instant (War Cabinet168, Minute 11), and instructed the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to inform Lord Kewton that his Missionwere not empowered to commit His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto any arrangement similar to that agreed upon between france and Germany at the Berne Conference ; they wereto confine themselves to hearing and discussing any such proposals of a tentative nature the German delegates might put forward, and they should inform the said delegatesthat the Mission must, in the first instance, submit those proposals to their Government for their consideration.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Draft Minute(W.P. 21) (Appendix) of the Cabinet Committee on -War Policy inregard to long-distance bombing operations. The Draft Minuterecorded the following decision of the Cabinet Committee : &quot; For the moment the attitude of the Leader of the House ofCommons, when pressed on this question, should be to reply inthe sense that we intend to use our Aerial Forces in the best possible manner, and that our Naval and Military authorities arethe best judges of what this should be. If, however, the pressure in the House of Commons should be very great, the Leader ofthe House should either &apos; Spy Strangers,&apos; and make a short,frank statement in Secret Session, or else he should arrange fora meeting of members in oue of the committee rooms in theHouse of Commons, at which he himself should preside,accompanied by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff andother experts, who should be prepared to answer questions that might be put to them.&quot;The War Cabinet approved the above decision of the CabinetCommittee.Long-distanceBombing.
Reduced Railway 5. With reference to War Cabinet 168, Minute 3, Mr. BarnesFares, for Lai win&apos; stated that, as instructed by the War Cabinet, he had summonedon i a lona i e.c. s. representatives of the Departments concerned, with a view todrawing up a uniform system to govern the reduction of railway faresof men employed on national work which necessitated travelling bytrain. He reported that it was agreed by all the representatives that, as a special,war measure, the Employment Department of theMinistry of Labour should be empowered to issue vouchers, whentransferring agricultural or other labour for work of national importance, at a reduced rate of fare and a quarter for returnjourneys, and five-eights for single journeys, and that the differencebetween that amount and the full fare chargeable by the railway executive Committee should fall upon the State funds.The War Cabinet approved the above recommendation.The Eat tern Front. fi. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, accordingto the latest information received by him, there was some prospectof the Russians assuming the offensive on the Eastern Front. Thatfront is roughly divided into four sectors: the northern, thewestern, the south-western (opposite Lemburg and Taruopol), andthe Roumanian Front. An offensive on a large scale was timed to start on the following day in the south-western sector oppositePublic Warnings 4. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary ofof Air Raids. State for Home Affairs regarding Public Warnings of Air Raidsin London (Paper G.T.-1173), stating the advantages and dia-advantages respectively of public warning.The advantages were stated to he as follows : (1.) That it affords persons in the street an opportunity to take-refuge in houses or other places where they are exposed to somewhat less risk than in the streets ;(2.) That many people are relieved from continuous anxiety ifthey can feel sure that they will have warning before anattack, large employers of labour, in particular,-feeling aspecial responsibility towards their workpeople.The reasons against public warning were (.1.) The increase in the death-roll likely to be caused by personscrowding into the street to watch the attack, by work-people dispersing from factories, and by women rushingto the schools to fetch home their children. On theother hand, a warning repeated on several occasions andnot followed by an attack was likely to be disregardedand become useless for any purpose ;(2.) The strong objection which many people feel to the periodof acute suspense which follows a warning;(3.) The disturbance of business, not only in the case of actualattack, but of all abortive warnings :(4.) Similar disturbance of work in factories, particularly in munition factories. Experience showed that in most cases, if factory workers are withdrawn from work onaccount of an apprehended air raid, they would notresume work the same day ;-(5.) The probability that one of the chief objects of the germans in air raids was to cause dislocation of business, trans-port, and manufacture, and that they would be encouraged to repeat the raids if they succeeded in this.The War Cabinet decided that No public warning should be given of impending air raids inLondon.
Tarnopol. Ia this sector there were eighty-five Russian divisions, hutmany of them were without artillery. The Russians proposed to employ about forty of these divisions in the offensive. He said that,according to the Austrian communiques, the Russians were alreadyshowing signs of renewed activity in this area. Reports receivedfrom General Barter were to the effect that, with one exception, allthe divisions seemed to be in favour of the resumption of the offensive. So far as ammunition was concerned, they were bettersupplied than this time last year. General Poole had afso reportedthat the discipline and moral of some of the Russian troops appearedto he good ; and he was inclined to think that, if there was properco-operation between the artillery and infantry, and if the transport services on the fines of communication behind the front proved equafto the demand that would be made upon them, there was reason to hope that the offensive wouid prove successful Opposite to theRussians in that sector there were few German, and mainly Austriandivisions.General Robertson said that he had no report to make in regardto the other fronts.7. The First Sea Lord reported a number of engagementsbetween His Majesty&apos;s ships and various submarines, and in particular the following: (a.) The special service vessel &quot; Ready,&quot; in rear of a convoy,engaged an enemy submarine about 50 miles west ofGuernsey. Ten hits were observed, and the submarinesank.(6.) Three armed trawlers bombed a hostile submarine with adepth charge, 6 miles south-east by east of Scurdi Ness.Large quantities of heavy oil came to the surface sometime afterwards, and the trawlers believed that thesubmairne was destroyed.(c.) The commander of the destroyer &quot; Doon &quot; reported that he believed he had sunk an enemy submarine with a depthcharge on the 23rd instant, about 30 miles east-south-east of Fair Islands.(d.) On the 19th instant two trawlers were brought up by amoving object 19 miles from Fair Islands. A depthcharge was dropped, and oil came to the surface. Onthe 23rd sweepers found an obstruction at the spot, and dropped a depth charge, resulting in large quantities of oil appearing.(e.) A seaplane attacked an enemy submarine on the 25thinstant about 8 miles north of Cape Cornwall. the seaplane dropped three 100-lb. bombs on the submarine,and shortly afterwards a large upheaval was observed.8. In the Eastern Mediterranean two enemy mines explodedunder the stern of the destroyer &quot; Bulldog &quot; on the 22nd instant.There were no casualties, but the ship would need docking.9. On the 25th instant three British seaplanes encountered tenhostile aircraft in the vicinity of Roulers. One enemy plane was seen to go down in flames, and it is believed that two more were driven down out of control.   Our own patrol returned safely.
Greece. 11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thatthe relations between the French and Italians were becoming increasingly strained. The Italians were advancing into Illyria,and had not only effected a military occupation of Janina, but theyhad established an Italian Prefet there. This assumption of administrative authority had infuriated both the Greeks and theFrench.(The further consideration of this question was postponed.)Salonica: 12. In connection with the reported accentuation of the frictionGeneral Sarrail. between the French and Italian Governments, it was pointed outthat the early transfer of General Sarrail to another sphere of activity might appreciably relieve the situation (War Cabinet 160,Minute 1.1). It was suggested that General Sarrail&apos;s use of thetroops under his command had been more successful for the achieve-ment of a mainly diplomatic purpose than for the prosecution of a vigorous offensive in the field. In view, however, of the politicalsituation in France, which had been eased by the recent diplomaticcoup which General Sarrail had consistently recommended, the WarCabinet decided that -No steps shordd he taken at present to remind the FrenchGovernment of their engagement to transfer the Generalfrom Salonica.Conferences. 13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet that under existing arrangements His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had undertaken to send representatives to attend twoConferences of the Entente Governments, to consist of British,French, Russian, and Italian delegates, one to be held on or beforethe 1st July, if possible, and the other to meet in August, in orderto reconsider the general question of war aims and-peace terms.It was pointed oirt that while, on the one hand, the ItalianGovernment refused to consider the possibility of a separate peacewith Austria, the Russian Government were not at present disposed to discuss the military situation, except so far as the Salonica Frontwas concerned.Mr. Balfour stated that, in his opinion, and judging from their recent utterances, it would not be difficult to place, dialectically, theProvisional Government at Petrograd in an untenable position, andso to compel them either to stultify themselves or to commit their forces to a resumption of the offensive.(The matter was postponed for consideration at a later date.)Military service acts:Committee ofJEnquiry.[995-5]14. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that in the orders of the Day down for discussion in the House of Commons that afternoon was the question of a Committee of Enquiry to beappointed to enquire into and report upon (1.) The instructions issued by the War Office with regard tothe administration of the Military Service (Review ofExemptions) Act, 1917.(2.) The method, conduct, and general administration of medicalexaminations under the   Military Service (Review ofExemptions) Act, 1917.In his view, all the Government had engaged to do was to institutean inquisitorial body, which should ascertain, for the satisfaction ofCAmerican 10. The First Sea Lord reported that the first troops of the contingent. American contingent had landed at St. Nazaire.
Parliament, whether the medical examination of men required formilitary service was properly conducted and whether exemptionswere fairly and impartially granted.It was suggested that any comprehensive re-examination ofrejected men was not possibie, and that the constructive energyof the Committee could best be devoted to indicating what reformedprocedure should be adopted in the future. It was pointed out thatto empower the Committee to.enquire into the larger question ofthe instructions issued by. the War Office with regard to theadministration of the Act would temporarily dislocate the machineryof a very important branch of a great War Department, and was,consequently, impracticable.The War Cabinet decided that The Committee&apos;s enquiry should be confined to an investigation of the method, conduct, and general administration of medical examinations under the Military Service Acts.The Agricultural 15. With reference to War Cabinet 145, Minute 9, the war programme. Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by Lord Milner on thelabour required for the Agricultural Programme (Paper G.T.-1147).Lord Milner called attention to the iirgency of the matter, and statedthat he had explored all possible sources of labour supply and hadreduced the demands on the Army to the minimum. It had to beremembered that the agricultural industry was short of men beforethe war, and that out of fess than a million then employed the army had now taken nearly one-fourth, and these in the prime of life.Simultaneously the Government, on account of the submarine campaign, was making the most unprecedented demands on the farmers for home-grown grain. It was true that a large number ofwomen had been drafted to the land, but these were unfitted formany duties performed by men. He wished to recognise in thefullest way the liberal help which, at various intervals, the WarOffice had rendered to the farmers, but such help was uncertain and left the farmers with a sense of insecurity. What he now askedwas that the War Office should continue the help now beingrendered, should increase it by about 50 per cent, should make itcertain and continuous, and should grant the increse immediately.The War Cabinet carefully considered the following proposals made by Lord Milner (Paper G.T.-1147, pages 6 and 7): (a.) That no more whole-time workers should be taken from theland except with the consent of the County agricultural committees.(6.) That the men now lent to agriculture till the 25th Julyshould be allowed to remain after that date, except in sofar as they are replaced by other men of the samequality.(c.) That in addition to the above the Army should he calledupon to furnish 5,000 men a week for ten weeks,beginning with the first week of duly, the five firstcontingents to be men of previous agricultural experience,or in any case men used to handling horses.All these men, like those in (o), should be allowed to remainin agricultural work, unless replaced by others of thej. same quality.   The 17,000 men promised by the army for the hay and corn harvests, or as many of them asmay be allowed to remain in agriculture when thoseharvests are over, should be regarded as a deduction from the number to be furnished by the Army in the fivelater weeks.   Thus, if all these men should be allowed
to remain, the number to he then furnished during thatperiod would be 8,000 in all, instead of 25,000.The War Cabinet were strongly impressed by the argumentsused in support of the above proposals, and by the difficulty ofdiscovering any alternative sources of labour supply.The War Cabinet decided that Before coming to a final decision, the Memorandum should be circulated to the Secretary of State for War, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, Lord French, the Adjutant-General and the Director-General of Recruiting, and thatthe views of the War Office be ascertained and laid beforethe Cabinet at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, the 27th June.Naval Shipbuilding 16. With reference to War Cabinet 58 the War Cabinet hadProgramme. under consideration the proposals (Paper G.T,-1133) of the Boardof Admiralty for an increased shipbuilding programme, for com-pletion by the end of J91S. In view of the probable&apos; strength of theGerman Fleet at that time, the need for Destroyers in connectionwith the submarine menace, and the fact that as the result offurther investigation and the division of the Shipbuilding Yards ofthe country into two classes, it had been found that the Navalshipbuilding resources could be developed to the extent shown below without serious detriment to mercantile shipbuilding, theWar Cabinet approved the laying down of the following vessels : -(a.) Eight light cruisers of the &quot; C &quot; and &quot; D &quot; Class.(/).) Twenty-four torpedo boat destroyers.(c.) Eighteen &quot;H&quot; Class submarines, eight of which would bein place of four &quot; L&quot; boats already approved (WarCabinet 58, vii.). It was further approved that, as faras&apos;the Admiralty might consider practicable, additional&quot;H&quot; Class boats might be substituted for &quot;L&quot; classboats, already approved, in order to accelerate com-pletion.(d.) Four patrol boats.(e.) The War Cabinet &apos; approved the alteration of H.M.S.&quot;Cavendish&quot; into a seaplane-carrier, and note that thebuilding of two of the seaplane-carriers authorised by war Cabinet 58, Minute 12, has been suspended pending further enqiuries, the result of which the First Sea lord was requested to report.Trawlers. 17. The First Lord stated that it had been found that twenty-four of the trawlers authorised by the War Cabinet (War Cabiuet58, Minute S) could not be built in this country, and that he wasendeavouring to have them constructed in Canada.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained the existingexchange difficulties, but stated that he had given directions thatthe requisite financial arrangements must be made in this case.The War Cabinet approved the action of the Chancellor of theExchequer.Mesopotamia 18. The War Cabinet had under consideration the MemorandumCommission: by Lord Curzon (Paper G.T.-1108) as to. disciplinary action withAction Uiaiy regard to the conduct of certain officers as set out in the Report ofthe Mesopotamia Commission, and it was pointed out that, apartfrom trial by Court Martial, or summary removal by the King (under[995-5J D
Article 525 of the Royal Warrant), the Army Council had thepower, under the provisions of Article 527 of the Royal Warrant forthe Pay, &amp;c, of the Army, to call upon an officer who had not been guilty of misconduct to retire or resign his Commission.The Adjutant-General to the Forces informed the War Cabinetthat of late years it had been the policy of the Army Council to lay-by Court Martial any officer who was thought to have been guilty of an offence that came under the provisions of the Army Act, andthat the course of removing an officer under the terms of a royal warrant was not adopted in such caees, as past experience had shown the undesirability and inconvenience of this method ofprocedure. He added that in cases of incompetence as opposed tomisconduct officers were allowed to retire, retaining any pensionsthey may have earned by long service.The Judge Advocate-General stated that culpable negligencecould be dealt with under the Army Act.As the War Cabinet had not had the opportunity of reading the evidence and subsidiary documents placed before the Commission,and as the military officers concerned had not been represented by counsel when before the Commission, and had not been called irponto defend themselves against any charge, the War Cabinet decidedthat &quot; The Judge Advocate-General should be called upon to perusethe Report, the evidence, and documents pertinent to thisquestion placed before the Commission, and that, after-discussing the matter with the Law Officers of the Crown,he should, as soon as possible, render a report to theSecretary of State for War, for the information of the WarCabinet, giving his view as to whether the evidencejustified a charge or charges being preferred against any ofthe military officers whose conduct is questioned by theCommission.&quot;The War Cabinet further directed &quot; The Secretary to take the necessary steps to have theReport, the evidence, and all documents relating thereto,transmitted to the Judge Advocate-General as soon aspracticable.&quot;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 26, 1917.
APPENDIX.W.P.-21. -CABINET  COMMITTEE  ON WAR POLICY.&apos; Draft Minute.Dong-Distance Bombing Operations.THE Cabinet Committee on War Policy have carefully considered the desirabilityof adopting a policy of bombing German towns, and they have consulted personallyField-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Lieutenant-General Sir David Henderson, and Major-General Trenchard on the subject. The Committee recognise that there is a strong,although a by no means unanimous, public opinion in this country in favour of thiscourse. They recognise also that the Germans would be more likely to be influencedthan the British people by attacks of this nature, if they could be repeated at frequent intervals.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Germans are in a much morefavourable position for attacks on British towns than we are for attacks on german towns. The German aeroplanes start from Belgian soil and have a reasonable chanceof being immolested, and even undetected, until they cross the British coast,and it is really only then that they enter the danger zone. British aeroplanesproceeding to attack German towns have first to cross the enemy&apos;s line andthen to traverse long distances of territory in the occupation of the enemy. the towns and villages in the occupied territory are connected up by telephone, andthe movements of the aeroplanes are continually reported. There are numerousanti-aircraft guns, and the British aeroplanes are liable to attack from aerodromesmaintained for training purposes in different parts of the country. The wholeoperation involves great risk and strain on the pilot. Moreover, the numberof important German towns that can be reached at all is very limited. Mannheim,where there are important military objectives, is regarded by our aerial expertsas the most suitable. The number of machines capable of reaching Mannheimis very few (Appendix I, W.P.-14). General Trenchard explained to the Committeethat some classes of machine which Avould theoretically cover the distance in practicewould be unable to do so, owing to the variation in the performance of particularmachines. Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig expressed the opinion that to carry out this operation would entail such risk to the Army operations that he was not justifiedin recommending it. He considered, however, that if another squadron of De Havilandaeroplanes should beoome-available early in July he might be in a position to carry out this operation quickly, provided the weather conditions were suitable, and he suggestedthat in these circumstances, if the War Cabinet decided to adopt a policy of bombingGerman towns, the matter might be left to him to decide at any particular momentwmether he had enough machines to carry it out without seriously affecting the Armyoperations (Appendix II, W.P.-17).The Committee were of opinion that it would not be wise to commence operations of this type unless we were in a position to continue them, if necessary. To carryout an isolated raid on Mannheim or some other German town would merely be to provoke reprisals by the enemy, and to invite a continuation and intensification of a form of warfare in which the conditions are more favourable to the enemy than to ourselves.The Committee decided that For the moment the attitude of the Leader of the House of Commons, whenpressed on this question, should be to reply in the sense that we intend to use our aerial forces in the best possible manner, and that our naval and militaryauthorities are the best judge of what this should be. If, however, the pressure in the House of Commons should be very great, the Leader of theHouse should either &quot; spy strangers &quot; and make a short frank statement in secret Session, or else he should arrange for a meeting of Members in one ofthe Committee rooms of the House of Commons, at which he himself shouldpreside, accompanied by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and other experts, who shoidd be prepared to answer questions that might be put to them.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 25, 1917.
Appendix I.W.P.-14 -Report on Long-Distance Bombing Operations.IN accordance with, instructions from the War Cabinet, we have considered thepossibility of undertaking bombing operations in the immediate future against military objectives in Germany.With the machines at present in our possession the only objective of real military importance against which operations could reasonably be undertaken is Mannheim.This is distant 100 miles from the trench-line, and allowing for wind and the necessity to get high, the distance to be covered would represent something like 350 miles, whichis nearly the total range of the machine.To carry this out there are, at present, two squadrons of De Haviland (4) aeroplaneswith the Expeditionary Force, and possibly a few more might be provided from thiscountry at once. It would be necessary to remove such machines as might be allottedfor this work temporarily to the neighbourhood of Nancy.It is considered that the operation would not be worth undertaking unless atleast thirty aeroplanes were available if both these squadrons were withdrawn from the front for an operation of thiskind, it would seriously affect the operations of the armies. During their absence nolong reconnaissance would be possible, and the bombing of railway junctions, ammunitiondumps, and enemy headquarters and aerodromes would be seriously curtailed.The Naval Air Service have, at present, no aeroplanes which could assist in suchan operation.Before entering on any very large programme of supplying bombing squadrons, itis considered that the present programme, calcrdated on the necessities of the fleetsand armies of the various theatres of war, including training, should be completed. If,however, approval is given now for the necessary increase in squadrons, and measures taken to assist supply, it would be possibles to begin bombing on a considerable scale by next Spring. Even if it were possible to organise a bombing force by october of this year, very little value would be obtained from it before the Spring, asthe weather during the Winter is such that long-distance flights over the enemy&apos;scountry are very seldom possible, without extreme risk.(Signed) DAVID HENDERSON, Lieutenant-General.G. M. PAINE, Commodore.H. TREN CHARD, Mayor-General.June 20, 1917.Appendix II.W.P.-17. -C.I.G.S. June 22, 1917.IN accordance with instructions received from the War Cabinet, I have consideredthe possibility of undertaking bombing operations against the Works in the Town ofMannheim in Germany.I am of the opinion that, to carry out this operation, it would entail such risk tothe Army operations, that I am not justified in recommending it.If another squadron of these machines becomes available during this month or earlyin next month, I am of the opinion then that I might be in a position to carry out this operation quickly, provided the weather conditions were suitable. . .I would suggest that under these circumstances the matter is left to me to decideany particular moment, whether I have enough machines to do it without seriouslyaffecting the Army operations. With the present supply of machines, the number ofserviceable machines varies very largely, even from week to week.(Signed)      D. HAIG, Field-Marshal.
