(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)I *L9 g e c ft s JL-CABINET      68    (56).Meeting of the Cabinet held in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room, House of Commons, on Friday, November 27, 1936, at 11-30 a.m.[PTE*   The Secretary was instructed to keep no formal record of the discussion referred to m the following Note for the Prime Minister, of which a single copy is to be retained in the Cabinet archives and under the personal care of the Secretary.)He KING.The Prime Minister said that the time had come when the Cabinet ought to know of certain discussions he had had with the King in regard to His Majesty&apos;s relations with Mrs Simpson.   This had not been necessay earlier, and it had been a matter in which the less that was said the better.   He emphasised the great importance uf secrecy, and begged the Cabinet to bear this in mind.   He himself had for a long time been worried about ohe situation, and had known that some time or another he would, have to approach the King on the matter.   He had delayed, not from any apprehension, but in order to find a satisfactory opportunity. When the time of Mrs Simpson&apos;s divorce was seen to be approaching, the opportunity had arisen. On the 18th October he had spent a week-end at Cumberland Lodge, which was close to Fort Belvedere.   He had ascertained that uhe King was leaving Port Belvedere on Sunday, October 18th, for Sandringham.   He had telephoned to-1-
the Port at 9-30 on  he Sunday, only to be told that4the King had left at 9 a.m. and was not due at Sandringham before 6 p.m.   As a matter of fact His Majesty did not arrive until 2 a.m.   Mr Baldwin had then telephoned to Major Hardinge and asked him to arrange for him to see the King and had mentioned the subject of the conversation.   He had offered to come to Sandringham, Dut had suggested that the interview would take place better at Port Belvedere as it would attract less attention.   The King had then promised to meet him at Port Belvedere on Tuesday, October 20th, at 11-30 a.m., which was subsequently  changed to 10-30 a.m. Thus his first interview on  he subject had taken place at Port Belvedere on Tuesday, October 20th, at 10-30 a .m.The Prime Minister then gave a resume of this conversation.   He had begun by letting the King know that his relations with Mrs Simpson were attracting a good deal of notice.   He had said that at the time when he left London for his rest cure there nad been no criticism of the King.   On his return he had found in his letter-bag a good deal wf correspondence on the subject, which nad resulted from statements in the American Press.   He had recalled how, some nine years ago, at the time uf the late King&apos;s illness, the then Prince of Wales had told him that he could say anything he likedy&apos;at any time 4 ^1LL&amp;--Ma je*-tey .   The King said that this still held good, and had himself recalled that at the time of the late King&apos;s death he had told him how glad he was to have him as Prime Minister. Mr Baldwin had wondered at that time whether uhe King would allow him, if necessity arose, to speak about a woman.   Continuing his account, the Prime Minister said-2-
that he had then told the King that a continuance of the present state uf affairs would sap the public respect   for the Throne.   If that respect went, nothing could restore the position of the Throne, and on the Tnrone depended the solidity of the whole Empire, including India.   He himself could never forget that he was addressing his King, but he also had to think of him as a man.   He had entertained great hopes from ohe preeminent gifts of popularity which the King possessed, but these would be counter-balanced by imprudent conduct and His Majesty&apos;s moral influence throughout the Empire might be dissipated.   He had asked the King if he could stop the divorce, but the King had replied that this was impossible, it was the affair of Mrs Simpson over which he had no control.   The Prime Minister had replied that after this case everybody would be saying &quot;What is to happen at the end of six months, when ohe decree is due to be made absolute?&quot;   When that time was reached the Press would no longer keep silence, and when that moment came a Press storm would arise.   That would be just before the Coronation.^ This he had repeated. He had added that the King might tnink perhaps that with his great popularity he might get away with it. &quot;You can&apos;t do that&quot;, the Prime Minister had said;    &quot;You may think that i am an old man dating from the Victorian regime, but I do know public opinion in this country. Since the tfar there has been a lowering of the public standards and of public morals, but pertaajpo -for tkat  gffg rtawea people expect even more of the Monarchy and they won&apos;t tolerate what they did tolerate in the early part of the last Century&quot;.   He had then begged   the King to think the matter over.   That was the first warning he had given.   When the conversation was over he felt glad that he had broken ohe ice, but he wondered if he had made much impression.-3-
Coming to the next interview with ohe King, the Prime Minister said that it had been his intention to see the King after his visit to Wales.   As a matter of fact, however, whe King had summoned him before that visit, on November 16th, and he was glad uf this renewed opportunity to discuss ohe matter.   On this occasion he had begun by pointing out the impossibility of the marriage so long as His Majesty remained King. Public opinion, neither in ohe United Kingdom nor in the Dominions, would stand for it, for the reason that the Wife of the King automatically became Queen.   They had talked on this matter for a quarter of an hour.   The King said that he would now say something that had long been in his mina to say to the Prime Minister:    &quot;I am going to marry Mrs Simpson*v J^ou are right about opinion in the country, so I shall go&quot;.   The Prime Minister then said that in that event it should be done in such a manner as to avoid any Constitutional struggle, so as to wake matters easy for his successor.   The King had said, rather plaintively, that people did not seem to mind if he had a mistress, but what they objected to was his naving a wife, and that this was hypocrisy. The Prime Minister replied that public opinion did not refuse to recognise that the King had a private life, but appreciated that the Wife uf ohe King must become Q,ueen. He had told the King of an interview he had had with Mr Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner, who had asked to see him in order to represent ohe Australian point of view.   Mr Bruce tnought that if the King married Mrs Simpson the Crown would not last long in Australia. He had added that the stories in ohe American Press were not sufficient to break up the position of the Crown in Australia, Dut marriage was a different matter. The High Commissioner had des^Kibed a talk he had had with
an old Anzac soldier   a New Zealander, aa a matter of fact.   The soldier had said that fri e King&apos;a gelations ^-n--h jy^r, c;s,yi&gt; ^,. a bit thick, bat ^awey takingthat woman with him to Gallipoli!&quot;   Mr Baldwin had told the King that there was a nasty feeling about the circumstances of the divorce, more especially as the King was not liable in his own Courts .   He had again asked the King for no reply, but that His Majesty should think ohe matter over.After this interview the King had told the Q,ueen and his three brothers that he was going to marry Mrs Simpson and abdicate.   He had thought it all over, and it would be an act of volition.On the following Sunday apparently a change had come over uhe King&apos;s mind.   On Monday, November 9th, the &quot;New York American&quot; had published articles to the effect that the King intended to marry Mrs Simpson in the Chapel in Buckingham Palace.   Other American papers nad published similar paragraphs, describing how Mrs Simpson was to become a Duchess at the time of the marriage.On Friday, November 20th, the Prime Minister had asked Mr Esmond Harmsworth to see him.   He had thought it useful to ask him, as Chairman of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, how long the newspapers would hold off on this matter.   When he asked to see him the reply from uhe &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was that they did not know where Mr Harmsworth was   which he believed was not correct.   He had not been able to see Mr Harmsworth until Monday, November 23rd.   During the conversation he had noticed that Mr Harmsworth was bursting with a desire to talk freely, and though Mr Baldwin nad not invited him to do so in so many words he had asked for permission lor this.   He had said tnat he knew a great-5-
deal, ohat it was a terrible situation, that all courses appeared to lead to disastrous consequences. Was .here, he asked, no compromise?   He had then proceeded to describe what was being said in the American papers .   He had asked why the King should not marry Mrs Simpson in a private capacity, on the condition that she was not to become Qiieen.   The Prime Minister had asked if this would not mean legislation. Mr Harms-worth agreed that it would.   He thought of seeing Mr Elias, *he proprietor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, whom he thought would agree in such a course.   Sir Walter Layton, Mm Tin 1 rtwl n imU , had tola 4wsn that his readers , who were Liberals and nonconformists, unly wanted marriage .   Wo hnfl replied that ke did- not think Parlitft iaent would accept that. c*^      *~  The Prime Minister had again seen ohe King on November 25th.   He knew that in uhe interval Mr Esmond Harmsworth had seen the King.   He saw that the King had changed his mind, and His Majesty had a bad cold and was not looking as fit as usual.   He had said &quot;I gather that Esmond Harmsworth has been to see you&quot;, and had sketched out the same ideas as Mr Harmsworth.   Mr Baldwin had made a preliminary comment that he did not think the House of Commons would agree to that arrangement, but had offered to think it over, to consult the Cabinet and to try and find out, discreetly and informally, the views held by Party Leaders here and in the &apos;  Dominions .   Ho had askafl if uhc King proposed to marry liMfuii&apos;ihi Ooinmafrteff.   This, he said, would be very awkward .   He had then told the King one or two things which he thought it would be useful for His Majesty to know.   First, he said that the viev.u expounded Uy   the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; wojo of no impoi&apos;lauut&apos;t. Whatever view was expressed by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; would only mean the-6-
opposition of Labour.   The King had said &quot;I believe many people would be sorry to see me go&quot;. The Prime Minister had agreed that everyone wanted to avoia the King&apos;s abdication but that there were tilings that public opinion would not stand and that uhey attached most tremendous importance to the integrity and position of the Crown, which were the only things that held the Empire together.   He had agreed that if the King abdicated there might be a wave of xeaction in his favour, but also bhere might be a wave of fury against Mrs Simpson.   All the women would put the blame on to her.   The King had said &quot;I agree, but it is most unfair&quot;. The Prime Minister agreed that it was unfair, but it was the way of the world.   He had asked the King if he would put on half a sheet of notepaper the proposal that he wanted examined.   The King had promised to do so, but he had not received it yet.   If he did not receive it after the week-end he would again ask for it.   The King had expressed regret that certain articles had appeared in ohe Press suggesting uhat there was a divergence f&gt;f -iHaiir -J ^ , v,Mi pj gt.-ry^ The Prime Minister had replied that it was very important to avoid that.   He had then told the King of  he words of a Cummunloti Member of Parliament &quot;I see we are going to have a Fascist King, are we?&quot;   He himself had added that he did not like the word &quot;Fascism&quot; for at once it was echoed by the word &quot;Communism&quot;.   He had added that whatever happened delay in a decision was bad.   The King agreed.   The Prime Minister had&apos;then promised to look into the whole matter and to consult the Cabinet on the subject.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that of one thing he had no doubt, and that was that at any rate for the time the King was passionately in love. His Majesty believed that his happiness was to be found in-7-
a union with Mrs Simpson.    In all human experience, however, he himself doubted whether this would be the case.   A man he knew had urged Mrs Simpson to leave the country.   She had replied &quot;If I do, the King will follow me&quot;.   He did not want ohe matter to end in that way. It would be an indelible disgrace for tne whole country. He repeated a strong appeal to the Cabinet for secrecy .The Prime Minister then said he had forgotten oo mention that on ohe previous day he had had a talk with Mr Attlee. iirst impression of the suggestion oheKing had asked him to examine was that Labour would nottouch it &quot;with the end of a bargepole&quot;, but had promisedThis ?&gt;U^/il Mtu,to make discreet enquiries.   Be had ohen asked what wouldbe the reaction of Labour to abdication.   Mr Attlee had replied that he thought on ohe whole that they would be sympathetic to the King and. would say that ne had done the right thing and. that there would be a sigh of relief.It still remained for him to see Sir Archibald Sinclair, Lord Salisbury, who had brought a small deputation to him on  he subject, and Mr Attlee more formally.   He also proposed to make some very discreet enquiries as to feeling in ohe House of Commons. Finally, it was necessary now to consult the Dominion Prime Ministers .   He did not ask the Cabinet for a decision that day.A discussion of a preliminary nature then took place, which was mainly occupied with questions for purposes of information ana with the arrangements for consulting the Dominions.At the end or the Meeting the following Ministers   the Prime Minister, ohe Chancellor of ohe Exchequer, the Home Secretary, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence   were asked to consider the matter in the first instance to assist the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs
in drawing up an appropriate telegram from the Prime Minister to the Prime Ministers of ohe Dominions, and, in the second place, to as certain what was being done to explore the matter in its varied, technical aspects prior to further examination by the Cabinet.I 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I, November 27, 1936.
