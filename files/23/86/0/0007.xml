THE PROPOSED PIV&quot;-POWER OONPBRENOS.Preparations for.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 65 (36), Conclusion 1.)2.  The Cabinet again had before them the followingdocuments on the subject of Preparations for theproposed Five-Power Conference:-A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Coi-ioittee (CP.-302 (36)) on the German and Italian objections to a guarantee to the United Kingdom:A Memorandum by &quot;is Majesty1 s Government in the United Kingdom regarding the Agenaa of the Five-Power Conference (CP.-307 (36)), communicated to the Belgian, French, German and Italian Governments on November 4th, in which their attention was drawn to the chief points of difference between the Governments concerned in the preparations for the proposed new Western Pact:together withA Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-314 (36)) covering the draft of a further Memorandum (as amended in the light of the discussion at the Meeting mentioned in the margin) for communication to the above-named Governments, containing the views of His Majesty1s Government in the Uniteu Kingdom on the points of difference referred to above.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained in turn the various amendments that had been introduced in the revised Memorandum for communication to the Belgian, French, German and Italian Governments.Discussion took place in regard to paragraph 14of the revised Memorandum attached to CP.-314 (36)and more particularly the following sentence in themiddle of the paragraph:-&quot;It appears, however, to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be essential to provide, as was done in the Treaty of Locarno, tnat guarantora, in deciding to intervene, should know that their decision is subject to a subsequent pronouncement by the competent body, so as to ensure that action without a previous finding by that body would   not be taken except in cases Where no reasonable doubt can exist.&quot;-2-
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that while the whole question was rather complicated, the Foreign Office believed that the German Government had in Diind that the Five-Power Agreement should not come into force unless both &quot;bhe guarantor Powers agreed that it should.    This would enable Italy to put the brake on aotion being taken. This, he thought, was not acceptable to us, and it was oertainly not consistent with the existing Locarno Treaty.The words &quot;so as to ens-re that action without a previous finding by that body would   not be taken&quot; was criticised on the ground that thev were probably not correct.The Secretary of State lor Foreign Affairs explainea that these words had been introduced, first, becaus7 they were consistent with the existing Locarno Treaty, and, second, that they met some of the German objections to the Franco-Soviet Pact.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that he had raised this point at the last Meeting, and the re-dralt did not meet his objection, which was that the League of   ations was in a tottering position and he would therefore prefer to base the whole paragraph on the Pact ol Paris.   He did not endorse the German proposal that action should be made conditional on the agreement ol both the guarantors, but he woulo. like the position to be that if Italy said that she was not bound to take action, we should be free to take our own decision.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that that was a weakening of the guarantee to France and Belgium as compared with Locarno, which We had always   ir.Verpr~ted as involving joint ana several action in the event of a breach*
The Secretary of Stat^ for. Foreign Affairs then suggested to substitute the word &quot;desirable&quot; for. the word &quot;essential&quot; (underlined in the above quotation).This was accepted. The Secretary of State for Air reminded th&quot; Cabinet that in the draft Memorandum (paragraph 4) we were asking to receive guarantees from France and Germany. Pe recalled that the Chiefs of Staff Committee, in &quot;   making their recoriime-ndation that Belgium should not be asked to give a guaranteehad assumed that France woula be in alliance with this oountr.y.   This was J ver~  important from the point of view of Air action. If Belgium was to be neutral and we were not in alliance with France and could neither fly over hex territory nor use French bases, the Royal Air Force would be very handicapped as regards access to German bombing targets.    He asked, therefore, to have it placed on the record of the Cabinet that Franoe as an ally was the basis of the Chiefa of Staffs&apos; recommendation.This was agreed to. The Cabinet agreed  (a) To- approve the Memorandum attached to CP.-314 (36) for communication to the French, Belgian, German and Italian Governments, including the deletions and amendments of the original Memorandum as set forth therein, subject to:-(i) In paragraph 14, line 16, thesubstitution of the word &quot;desirable&quot; for the word &quot;essential&quot;:(ii) Consequential on the omission of paragraph 5, which dealt with &quot;The second question&quot;, a drafting alteration in the first words of paragraph 6, where &quot;The third question&quot; becomes &quot;The second question&quot;; and paragraph 10, where &quot;The next and fourth question&quot; becomes &quot;The next and third question&quot;:
lb) To take not&apos; that in making their Report, contained in CO.-302 (36), the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had made the assumption of Prance being in alliance with this country,
PHB SITUATION IN SPAIN.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 65 (36), Conclusion 2. )BELLIGERENT i RIGHTS TO.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 58 (36), Cen-clusion 6.)3. The Cabinet were informed that the Admiralty now took the view that it would be an advantage to confer belligerent rights on both sides in the Spanish struggle, rather than to await the fall of Madrid, as contemplated in the Cabinet Conclusion on this subject referred to in the margin.The First Lord of the Admiralty explained that, judging by some of the sieges that had taken place during the present civil war in Spain, it might be some time before Madrid fell.    In the meanwhile the position was becoiuing increasingly difficult. For example, a case had recently arisen of a Russian merchant ship carrying Russian ammunition to the Spanish Government which had sailed under the British flag.    In time of war this was a legitimate ruse-de-guerre, but it was not permissible in time of peace. In a sense, thereiore, by allowing this misuse of the flag it could be said that we were recognising belligerent rights de facto, or, to put it differently, we were recognising one of the disadvantages of belligerency at a time when we did not grant belligerent rights.The Cabinet were reminded that by conferring belligerent rights we should in effect be admitting to the Spanish insurgents that their waging of war had  .reached a point at which we recognised that they had sufficient force to stop ships proceeding to Spanish ports and that we admitted th ir right to search British ships   action which they could not otherwise take without committing an act of piracy. The Cabinet agreed  (a) To confirm the previous decisionmentioned in the margin, that if and when the insurgents capture Madrid they should be recognised as belligerents, which w^uld include the power&quot;to exercis&apos; belligerent rights at sea:-6-
(b) That further info mat ion was required before taking a decision as to whether belligerent rights oould be granted before the capture oi Madrid:(c) That the Secretary of State for B&apos;oreign Affairs should circulate a Memorandum, before the next regular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet, on the Admiralty proposal.
ISPAIN. The Non-Intervention Committee. (Previous Reference: Cabinet 58 (36), Conclusion 5.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that the International Non-intervention Committee was continuing its work of examining alleged breaches of the Non-Inte.vention Agreement.    In view of the man:-, breaches, however, it was impossible to maintain the present position.   To keep the Committee in being a scheme had been worked out by British Government Departments for exercising- supervision over importation of arms in Spanish ports.    It was an excellent scheme, but involved a very large personnel and a cost of  900,000 a year.   Moreover, it could only be carried out with the approval of the parties concerned.    The representative of the U.S. S.R. had declared that he was in favour of the scheme provided it would be effective, but it seemed probable that the tactics were to declare that it was not effective, so as to obtain freedom lor the undisguised importation of arms.    The representative of the U.S.S.R. also thought that the Spanish Government would accept the proposal, but in the Secretary of State&apos;s own view it was unlikely that either party would consent.The Cabinet were reminded that telegrams were pouring in every day revealing a steady importation of arms into Barcelona from Russia, and to some extent to other ports from other countries.    The Nonintervention Agreement was being continuously broken, and it was suggested that to maintain the International Comndtx.ee was a sheer farce.While this was not contested, it was pointed out that it was the existence of the Committee that enabled the French Government to maintain a neutral position.    If it disappeared they would hardly be able to escape from allowing the exportation of arms to the Spanish Government.    Tlr- object of the Agreement had been to prevent the Spanish Civil war-8-
from spreading into the rest of Europe, and for this purpose it was still effective*The general view of the Cabinet, therefore, was that it was desirable to keep the Non-Intervention Committee in existence at present.    As the British scheme for making it effective had been heavily criticised on the ground of its cost, it was suggested that advantage might be taken of a French suggestion to draw up a more economical scheme, which could then be considered by the Committee.
IITALY. R?lations with. (Previous Reference: Cabinet 64 (36), Conclusion 1. )5.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had had a conversation with the Italian Ambassador prior to the latter&apos;s leaving for Rome. Since then Signoi Grand! had seen Sir Robert Vansittart and had given him a message expressing Signor Mussolini&apos;s &quot;great satisfaction&quot; at Signor Giandi&apos;s account of his interview with the Secretary of State.    The Italian Ambassador&apos; had paid a second and final visit before leaving for Rome, in the course of which he had given an outline of Signor Mussolini18 general ideas as to the form in which the relations between the two countries might be improved, namely, by a &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot; rather than a formal Agreement.    The Secretary of State read to the Cabinet the passage which the Italia Ambassador had communicated to him.    He added that the negotiations appeared to be progressing satisfactorily, and asked for authority to continue them on present lines.The Lord Privy Seal expressed the hope that in considering these matters the Secretary of State for Foreign Afi airs would not press Signor Mussolini too hard about returning to the League of Nations. The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to continue his negotiations with a view to Improving relations with the Italian Government.
JAPAN.British and Genuan Relations with.-(Previous Reference: Cabinet 3 (36), Conclusion 6. )6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsrecalled that for some time there had been rumoursthat Germany was seeking closer relations with Japan.Recently he had received a telegram from His Majesty&apos;sAmbassador in Tokio that Germany and Japan were onthe verge of reaching an understanding. Consequentlyhe had seen the Japanese Ambassador and warned him, ofa .propos/tentative suggestions that the Ambassador had made for improving relations with this country, that we could not enter into a combination against any other country, and that if there was a combination between Japan and any othei country against some third party it would make the Anglo-Japanese conversations more difficult.    Relations with Japan would not be improved by a regrettable leading article in &quot;The Times&quot;, which had not consulted the yoreign Office before writing it.   A further complication was that he could not postpone beyond that very day making a statement on the recent Keelung incident, in the course of which he was bound to show that the Fleet could not visit Japanese ports until the matter had been cleared up.    He added that .he German-Japanese understanding was not thought to be directed against this country.    It did indicate, however, that Japan might act contrary to our interests if Germany was at war wixh us.    There was, howevex, no new factoi there, as it had long been thought a possibility.    One result of the understanding was that Rusao-Japanese relations were likely to become more tense.The First Lord of the Admiralty added some informa-tion that had reached him as to the nature of the pact. He apprehended that in addition to an anti-Communist part of the understanding there might be a second part containing a irdlitary agreement.    There were indications that moderate opinion in Japan was by no means-u-
pleased with this arrangement, and one of the most regr ttatle aspects of the undeib1auding was tha probability that the mod-rates in Japan had once more been overborne.
THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ACT, 1935.Bill to Amend Sections 292 and 293.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 39 (36), Conclusion 10. )C The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State lor India (CP.-313 (36)) seeking the approval of his colleagues to the submission to the Committee of Home Affairs of a short and formal Bill to amend Sections 292 and 293 of the Government of India Act, 1935, with the luain object of imiking clearer the meaning of certain words which were intended to preserve intact the Indian Statute book notwithstanding the repeal of the existing Government oi India Act. The Secretary of State suggested that the Bill might be placed on the Order Paper of the House of Commons for all its stages along with the East India Loans Bill. The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for India should submit to th^ Committee of Home Affairs a Bill on the lines suggested in   his Memorandum (CP.-313 (36)) and summaiiseu above.
THE LONDON&apos; NAVaL TREaTY.Cruisers d^e for Scrap pin p.i (Previo Reference: Cabinet 62 (36), Conclusion )21 If8. The First Lord of the Adndralty recalled the conclusion reached by the Committee of Imperial Defence on May 12, 1936 (C.I.D. 278th Meeting, Conclusion 5) authorising the Admiralty to carry out their proposals for reducing our total Cruiser tonnage to the limits permitted at the  nd ol 1936 under- the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which involved the scrapping of five small Cruisers. The Government had been severely attacked in Parliament for this decision, and it had been difficult to defend the scrapping ol five Cruisers, that is to say, a reduotion of the total number of Cruisers from 50 to 45, at a time when we were aiming at possessing 70 Cruisers.    At that time it had looked as though, if these Cruisers were scrapped, Japan woula be compelled to carry out her part of the Treaty and to scrap better and more numerous Cruisers.    It had also been thought that the Americans would object to our invoking the &quot;Escalator&quot; Clause so as to avoid this scrapping, and would run out of the Cruiser &quot;holiday&quot;.    It now transpired that the Japanese, through having retarded their programme, would not be obligea to scrap any Cruisers of any value at all.    A further point was that it was now found that these Cruisers could be made very valuable as convoy escorts.    In addition, it had been ascertained that the United States Government would have no objection to our invoking the &quot;Escalator&quot; Clause and keeping the Cruisers, and that it would not affect their attitude to the 1935 Agreement. The Japanese would reply by invoking the &quot;Escalator&quot; Clause to enable them to maintain some/Booyore.   W  adpht-tttoiku a formal proiem, but uid nul really wxsh tJ prass tin ehjert,i,,nn.    If the Japanese objected to our-14-
invoking the &quot;Escalator&quot; Clause they had no means of retaliating, since they were not signatories of the 1935 Agreement.    He asked the Cabinet, therefore, to authorise a departure from the decision of last May,-am approach to the United States Government, and the retention of the Cruisers.In the course of a short discussion the Lord President of the Council recalled that when the Naval Treaty of 1930 had been drawn up provision had been made for the jaoriad. ow^lthe expiration of the Treaty. He felt certain that anYc International Court would uphold the action we now contemplated.    He was anxious, however, that the matter should be put publicly in such a way as not to make it look as though we were doing anything at variance with the intentions of the Treaty.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that any announcement would have to be on the ground of a deterioration in the state of the world.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs entered a caveat that the announcement should not be made until the Japanese had been given some time to reply to our last comrmnication on the subject.    He paid a warm tribute to the very helpful attitude of the United States Government.    Under the Treaty they would not have to scrap any Cruisers, ana in allowing1 us to invoke the &quot;Escalator&quot; Clause they were enabling Japan also to keep Cruisers.    Their attitude, therefore, had been exceptionally friendly.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of the First Lord of the Admiralty that, notwithstanding the Conclusion of the Corirxiittee of Imperial Defence on the 12th May, our policy should be to keep the five Cruisers, and that formal approach on the subject should be made to the United States Goverrjment:-15-
(b) That any announcement on the subject should be deferred, and that the mattci should be arranged between the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary ot State for Foreign Affairs.
FACTORIES BILL.I (PreviousP Reference:Cabinet 57 (36) Conclusion 4)9.     The Home Secretary reminded the Cabinetof the conclusion reached on the subject of theFactories Bill referred to in the margin to theeffect that if it were decided to proceed withthe Factories Bill in the present Session, a&apos;    Cabinet Committee should be appointed which theHome Secretary could invoke on specific points ofdifficulty arising in the preparation of the Bill.He asked that the Cabinet should now implementthe decision.The Cabinet agreed:That a Conimittee should be appointed composed as follows -The Home Secretary (In the Chair). The Secretary of State forScotland. The Minister of Health. The Minister of Labour. The President of the Board ofEducation. The First Commissioner of Works. The Parliamentary Under-Secretaryto the Board of Trade.which the Home Secretary could invoke on specific points of difficulty arising in the preparation of the Factories Bill.
II THE UNEMPIjOYMENTI assistance II (temporary pro-II visions) (amsnd- rfiSNT) BILL.I (Previous  Reference:I Cabinet 58I (36), Con-I elusion 9 andI Appendix.)10.   The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary oi State for Scotland and theMinister of Health (CP.-311 (36)) covering a draftBill to authorise a continuance of grants to PublicAssistance Authorities, for a period of twelve monthsto March 31, 1937, to meet the cost of relief ofable-bodied unemployed who are on public assistance.After that date the Unemployment Assistance Boardwould become responsible for the persons in respectoi whose relief these compensatory grants had beenpaid, and the necessity for the grants would thencease.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred inthe above procedure, and the authors of the Memorandumasked that, as it was desirable that the Bill shouldpass through all its stages before Christmas in orderthat the Local Authorities might receive further grantsas early as possible, and as there might be no meetingof the Committee of Home Affairs in the immediatefuture, the Cabinet should authorise the Bill withoutreference to that Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who hadbeen asked by the Minister of Health to answer anyquestions that might arise on this Bill, said thatit was proposed that the &quot;hard cases&quot; referred to inparagraph 4 of the memorandum should be met by meansof levies on the gains of the more fortunateauthorities.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the introduction in the House of Commons of the Unemployment Assistance (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill attached to CP. 311 (36) without reference to the Committee of Home Affairs.- 10 -
&apos;VIIE CORONATION.Seats on the Processional Route.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 62 (36), Conclusion 15.)N.    11. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council (C.P.-310 (36)) on the question of the accommodation which could be provided to view the Coronation Procession on that part of the route over whioh the Government had control.    The matter had been considered by the Coronation Comriiittee of the Privy Council, and at the end of his Memorandum the ^Lord President summed up their conclusions as follows:-(1) Stands should not be erected on the west side of the East Carriage Drive in Hyde Park:(2) Seats on Government property should not be provided for indiscriminate sale to the general public, but should be allotted in accordance with a plan prepared in advance:(3) The price of seats on Government property should, in general, be cost price togeth r with a sufficient margin of profit to allow of a sum being distributed to a charity or charities:(4) The allocation of seats should be in general accordance -ith the scheme for 85,000 seats outlined in the Appendix to CP.-310 (36), on the understanding that the provision for Trade Unions, Friendly Societies, etc., should be about 10,000.The Lord President of the Council explained the position on each of the above orooosals in turn.In connection with Conclusion (2), the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the fact that the list of &quot;Active Influences in the Life of the Nation&quot; contained in the Aopendix to the Memorandum did not include any body reoresentative of agriculture.   The Lord President explained that this list was not a catalogue but only an indication of the kind of bodies for which orovision would be made. As soon as the Cabinet had dealt with the question-19-
it would be reopened and there was no doubt that provision would be made for agricultural bodies.Considerable discussion took Place on the third Conclusion and on the question of principle, whether the prices charged for seats on Government property should include provision for a margin of profit to allow a sum being distributed to a charity or charities,The First Commissioner of Works informed the Cabinet that since the meeting of the Coronation Committee tenders had been received for the construction of the stands.    At the Coronation Committee he had hoped that the tenders would admit of a price of from 15/-.  to  1 a seat, but the tenders indicated that they would more likely cost from 26/-.  to 29/-. If the seats were sold at 30/-.  aoiece therefore, there would not be much available for charity.    In reply to a suggestion that these tenders indicated profiteering, he pointed out that the price of timber and of labour had already gone, u? and that .labour would rasily ask f-cr a further rise; &apos;The Cabinet were also reminded that there was a building boom and that the provision of these stands involved contractors in a lock-up of considerable amounts of timber.The discussion centred mainly on the question of whether it v/as desirable to make an extra charge for charities in a matter of this kind. One suggestion was that the seats reserved for the poorer members of the community ought to be provided gratis, the cost being raised by an increase for the other seats.The Cabinet were reminded further that the additional cost v/as not likely to create difficulties with the Trade Unions as that could be arranged.-20-
The Cabinet were informed that some anxiety-had been expressed at the Coronation Committee as to the difficulty of selecting the charities to which any surplus could be given.    Some of the hospitals which were on the route would already make large sums from letting seats.    There might well be criticism, on a National and Imperial occasion of this kind, of allotting the bulk of the money to the hospitals of London.    A oroposal was oreferred that any surplus accruing from an increased charge in the orice of the seats should be given to the King George V Memorial Fund.The Cabinet were reminded of the importance of not interfering with the Coronation Committee in the matter.    The position was that the Government orovided the seats but put them at the disposal of the Coronation Committee to deal with.    They were entitled, therefore, to give that Committee an indication of their views.No objection was felt to raising the orice to  2 for an uncovered seat. t /        ,     r\ it iAt the end of the discussion the Lord President informed the Cabinet that standing room within the precincts of Government accommodation was not to be charged for.    Chairs/would be charged for at the rate of 2/5.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To take note of the proposals of the Coronation Committee of the Privy Council which were generally acceptable to the Cabinet.(b) That the Lord President should be requested to express to the Coronation Committeethe view of the Cabin&lt;et that there was no objection to charging a margin of profit to allow of a sum being made available to some wortJay object, but to ask that they should consider whether the best object would not be the King George V Memorial Fund.(c) To take note that when the detailed allocation of seats in Government stands was being considered the claims of agricultural bodies would not be overlooked.-21-
the Marriagebill.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 64 (36), Conclusion 14. )12.  The Cabinet had before them the Marriage Bill, introduced by a Private Member and down foi Second Reading in the House of GoBanons on Friday, November 20th.The Home Secretary said that the Attorney-General had taken some soundings and looked at this Bill.     He understood the Attorney&apos;s view to be that the Second Reading was likely to be carried.     It appeared important that the Government should have some general idea as to their attitude and as to the general line to be taken by the Government Spokesman.     He suggested that the Attorney-General should be asked to be the Spokesman for the Government on the Bill; that he should take up an attitude neither of approbation nor condemnation of the Bill; he might point out that there were some things in the Bill which were in line with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Divorce and Matrimonial Causes of 1912 and others that were not, e.g. the proposal in Clause 1.     The Government should not adopt the policy of cold-shouldering the Bill at the present stage.     The Attorney-General might, therefore, say that if the Bill was given a Second Reading, a Law Officer would be available to help the Committee upstairs.The Home Secretary also suggested that there might be a private understanding betweenmembers of the Cabinet and possibly other Ministers- 22 -
as to what their individual attitude should he towards the Bill.After a short discussion, the Cabinetagreed:(a) That the Attorney-General should beasked to watch and deal with this Bill on behalf of the Government and that he should adopt the general lines suggested by the Home Secretary and summarised above.(b) That there should be an understandingbetween Cabinet Ministers not to vote on the Second Reading of the Bill, but that this should not bind their action at any later stage.(c) That the Attorney-General should beasked to adopt the same line a6 Members of the Cabinet in not voting on the Bill.(d) That the above arrangements should notapply to other Ministers.
