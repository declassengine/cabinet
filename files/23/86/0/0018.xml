I f TEE KING.1 (Previous I Reference: I       Cabinet 73 I        (36), Con-1       elusion 1. )1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that a message was en its way from Port Belvedere in reply to the communication he had sent, at the request of the Cabinet, the same morning.   He had reoeived a telephone message that the effect of the message was that the King regretted that he could not reconsider his decision to renounce the Throne.
PROCEDURE IN THE EVENT OP THE KING PELINQUISHI1G THE THRONE.C(Previous Reference: Cabinet 73 (36), Conclusion 1 (d).)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that the Cabinet Committee, in accordance with the deoision referred to in the margin, had spent the afternoon in working out the procedure in the event of a decision by the King to relinquish the Throne.    The first point had been to ascertain what was the position within the Rules of the House of Commons and whether an Address should be sent in reply to the Royal Message. The Committee, after having enquired from the authorities of the House of Commons, had been informed that when the House of Commons was asked by the King to do something that wras within its power an Address was unnecessary and that the proper oourse was to move &quot;That the natter be now considered&quot;.So far as the time-table was concerned, the Committee had been assisted by the Pajliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, and they had reached the conclusion that it woulu be advantageous to pass the legislation this week.   The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury had made a happy proposal, that mention should be made of the King&apos;s desire for the ratter to be settlea immediately.    That would give a reason to the House of Commons for&apos; bringing in the legislation at once.    The Committee haa agreed also that the sooner the matter was all cleared up and the country could settle down to its normal life the better. In oraer to avoid any difficulty, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury had consulted Mr Attlee, Mr Greenwood, Sir Archibald Sinclair, Sir Austen Chamberlain and Mr Percy Harris.    All had agreed in the proposed procedure.   He proposed also to consult Mr Winston Churchill, but thought it unlikely that in this matter he would offer opposition.
Thus the procedure would be:~The Prime Minister would read the King&apos;s Message on the following day, and move &quot;That the matter he now considered&quot;.The Prime Minister would then ask leave to introduce the Bill.Copies of the Bill would be placed in the Vote Office the same day.The Prime Minister would move to take Private Members1 time on Friday and for the House to sit after 4 p.m.The Bill, it was hoped, would pass through both Houses on Friday.The King1 s Assent would be given on Friday evening.On Saturday morning the Accession Council would be held.Parliament would be sworn on Saturday and Monday.The above procedure was agreed to.
THE DRAFT ABDICATION H BILL.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Bill had been revised and an alteration made in the Preamble in order to bring out the King&apos;s desire for a rapid procedure.At a later- stage of the Cabinet the Home Secretary read the two Clauses of the Bill.The question was raised as to what names should be on the baok of the Bill.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should introduce the Bill.(b) That the Home Secretary should give him a brief to assist him in preparing his speech, and that the Secretary of&quot;State for Dominion Affairs should also give him a brief on the attitude of the Dominions.(c) That the names on the back of the Bill should include at any rate -The Prime Minister, The Lord President of the Council, The Chancellor of the Exchequer1, The Home Secretary, The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland, The Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Attorney-General, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for India.-4-

The broadcast woulu be a short one, and would include the following principal points:-(1) His Majesty&apos;s desire to marry the lady of his choice.(2) Relinquishment of the Throne was voluntary.(3) He was leaving oi his own free will.(4) A tribute to the consideration shown to him by the Government.(5) His desire to help the new King.The Home Secretary hoped that the broadcast would be so timed as not to cut across the Accession Council.The Prime Minister thought it would probably take place on Friday evening, if the Royal Assent to the Abdication Bill could be given in time.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.Vv.l, December 9, 1936.
