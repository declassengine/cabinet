ING&apos;S W7ENT J. ON | ARHY. levicus ^ ference:  binet 78 (36) ^ nclusion 1.)1.     The Prime Minister gave the Cab ire t an account of his audience with the King on the previous day, which had lasted for about five hours on and off.     Sometimes His Majesty had been alone and sometimes accompanied by one or two of his brothers or by Mr. Monckton or Mr. Allen.The Prime Minister impressed on hie colleagues the importance of secrecy at the present etage.After a discussion to elicit the generalviews of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister withdrewin order to see His Royal Highness The Duke of York,and the Agenda Paper was taken up under theChairmanship of the Lord President of the Council.(The Prime Minister returned just after the completion of the Agenda Paper.)In the meanwhile, the Home Secretary had prepared, for the consideration of his colleagues7 the draft of a message from the Prime Minister to the King incorporating the views expressed in the first stage of the meeting.     Various amendments were suggested.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the general lines of the message to oe sent by the Prime Minister to the King forthwith: the precise wording of the message was left to the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary.(Note:   As actually Bent,  the original draft was divided into two messages. Copies of these are on record on the Secretary&apos;s file of the Conclusions of the Meeting.)(b) That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should Bend a message to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions reporting the latest developments and the present position.- 1 -
(c) That the Secretary cf State for India should send a corresponding message to the Viceroy of InOia,(d) That the Cabinet Committee on Procedure in connection with the King&apos;s,    _ Intention to Marry should meet the* 7 i same afternoon at 4 p.m. in the roomof the Chancellor of the Exchequer to work out the details of the most convenient programme and time-table in the event of the King&apos;s abdication.(e) That members of the Cabinet should hold themselves in readiness for a meeting at any time the same afternoon or evening.(As mentioned above, the Prime Minister withdrew at this point and the Lord President of the Council took the Chair.)
I Hs FI VIC-POWERI cf-  &quot;  cr:. ^Hl gium.I (P. ^viousI c ibinet 69 36), Con-1. )2  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-332 (36)) in which he recorded his reoent oonveisations with   . Van Zeeland, the Belgian Prime Minister, on the present attitude of the Belgian Government as a result of the situation created by the withdrawal by Belgium of the guarantee she had hitherto given to France, and gave the text of the relevant portions of Mi Van Zeeland&apos;s statement in the Belgi-i: Parliament on December 2nd respecting Belgium&apos;s position in relation to the negotiations for the proposed Five-Power Treaty.    The Secretary of State also outlined in his Memorandum the problem of future policy and the line he proposed to take in discussing with the French and Belgian Governments points raised by the French in connection with the question of a Belgian guarantee.The Cabinet examined the proposals on which a decision was asked in paragraphs 2, 7 and 17 of the above menorandum.In the discussion on paragraph 7, the Cabinet were reminded that the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had somewhat hardened in favour of a neutralised Belgium.     The view was expressed that the contrary argument that the international guarantee had broken down in 1914 was not very impressive since the guarantee had proved effective from 1839 to 1914.     It was urged that though admittedly it might be very difficult to obtain the German guarantee to Belgium, it would be worth something if it could be secured.- 2 -
The Secretary of 3tate for Foreign Affairs said he was prepared to keep in mind that if it was found possible to negotiate a new &quot;Locarno&quot; Treaty., he would^ not exclude the possiblity of a neutralised DelgiuiiKIn considering paragraph 17, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he proposed to discuss it from the point of view of the Belgian position and not from that of the French position. He thought that this would be satisfactory from the point of view of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee for the reason that if Belgium wished to give facilities for military action to either party, they would be given under Article 16 of the Covenant*     He did not propose to press the Belgians beyond this view.In discussing paragraph 17 (3) a desire was expressed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should do his utmost to avoid any provision being made in any arrangements to replace the Locarno Treaty for Staff Talks or interchange of information between the Belgian and Germ an  Staffs on the one hand and the Belgian and French Staffs on the other. Though M. van Zeeland was understood to holdthe view that he might be in a position to tell theaFrench his dispositions against/hostile Germany and to tell the Germans his dispositions against a hostile France (since they dealt with two quite distinct cases)      it was pointed out that the French or German Staffs would be bound to ask for information about the strength of the forces involved.     It was suggested that any arrangement of that kind was likely to involve the loss of a multi-lateral pact. Eventually, it was decided to omit sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 17.- 3 -
The Cabinet agreed:(a) That with regard to M. van Zeeland&apos;s desire to conclude the provisional period, i.e. the continuance of the obligations of the existing Treaty of Locarno, as speedily as possible, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to ask the Belgian Prime Minister to await the conclusion of the exchanges of views at present proceeding between the Five Locarno Powers before calling in question the duration of the provisional period, and even then to make no definite move without reference to the Secretary of State. (CP.332 (36) paragraph 2.)(b) That with regard to M. van Zeeland&apos;s suggestion that in the event of a breakdown of the Locarno negotiations, an attempt might be made to negotiate a Treaty under which Germany, Great Britain, France and possibly also Italy would guarantee the independence and integrity of Belgium and possibly of Holland, as well as a possible second Treaty between Britain and France o,r between Britain, France and Germany, guaranteeing the German-French frontier (Belgium not being a party to the second Treaty) - the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to warn M. van Zeeland that he sees serious difficulties in the way ofhis new plan and would be grateful if he would abstain from putting it forward, even unofficially, until the situation has further developed.     He should also be authorised to add to M. van Zeeland that he saw considerable advantage in his carrying out a suggestion he made of finding some early excuse for an unofficial visit to Paris for conversations with the French Government. (CP.332 (36) paragraph?.)This conclusion was accepted on the understanding that if it was found impossible to negotiate a new &quot;Locarno&quot; Treaty, the Secretary of State for U41 a * Foreign Affairs would not exclude the&quot;7 &lt;^_Z*~W&apos;:&gt;     possibility of/a noutraliood Delgiuiru(c)   That in discussing with the French and Belgium Governments the points which the French Government have raised in connection with the Belgian decision to give no guarantee under the propos ed new &quot;Locarno&quot; Treaty, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should take the line proposed by him in CP. 332 (36), paragraph 17, with the emission of sub-paragraph (3) (in which he proposed to urge the Belgian Government to do their best to remove the present - - 4 -
uncertainty on their attitude towards co-operation with the French, etc.). The action he was authorised to take is therefore oontained in the following subparagraphs from CP. 332 (36), paragraph 17:-&quot;(1) The French Government havingraised the question of Belgium&apos;s responsibilities under paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the Covenant in the matter of the passage of troops across Belgian territory, I would propose to advise them to agree with M. van Zeeland to accept as the best solution that can be obtained in the circumstances the assurance which he is apparently ready to give, to the effect that he recognises Belgium&apos;s obligations under paragraph 3 of Article 16, provided that Belgium is alone judge of the circumstances when, and extent to which, she shall carry out these obligations.(2) I should ask the BelgianGovernment (again either alone or jointly with the French) to define their undertaking to forbid access to their territory, so as to mean that they will resist not only a violation by the German army of Belgian territory, but also of Belgian air by German aircraft.     This seems particularly important for us.X X X X(4) In discussing with the French the question of urging the Belgians to define the extent to which they are prepared to co-operate with France, I should make it clear that, although I sympathise with the desire of the French to remove the present uncertainty, I am not prepared to take part in any detailed discussions with regard to the actual French proposals (i.e. communication of defence plans, and the preparation of positions in Belgian territory for French troops), since His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves do not wish to participate in such measures of co-operation. The latter desideratum I am satisfied that the Belgian Government would not in any circumstances grant.-5-
H&quot;&apos;3 SITUATION  &apos;. SPAIN.  Previous K-ef erencetjabinet 69 (36)Conclusion 2). reposed intervention.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsreported that the proposal for mediation in Soain/fL* siti-had been transmitted to the Governments of AtaipM,Germany, Italy and Portugal, and aoorooriate actionhad been taken to try and secure the co-operation ofthe United States of America.    On the previous dayhe had seen the Italian and German ambassadors. TheItalian ambassador had been the more receptive of thetwo.    At any rate he had not adopted a negativeattitude and it was possible that Italy might be gladto support this proposal in order to get out of herembarrassments.    Nothing could be done until thereplies were received.    It would probably be necessaryto make an announcement of this action the sameafternoon.    He had hopes also that the President ofthe United States would make some announcement in thenear future and that Mr. Hull, the United StatesSecretary of State, might induce the South AmericanConference, now meeting in Buenos Ayres, to give somesupport to the proposal.
 &quot;Wain.H-3 Exchange prisoners.4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was glad to announce that an arrangement had been concluded for an exchange of prisoners between the parties in conflict in Spain.    He gave some   Particulars. The total numbers affected were about 4,000.    As the number of British warships available to assist in the exchange was insufficient, he made the suggestion that one or two merchant ships should be chartered for the purpose.The suggestion was made that some of the shins that had been used to bring troops home from the Mediterranean might be diverted for the purpose.The Cabinet agreed -To accept in principle the proposal that ships should be chartered to assist in the exchange of orisoners, subject to agreement between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
I(IE SITUATION SPAIN. ;-, Application or Gas Masks.5.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that an application had been received from the Spanish Government for the provision of gas masks. Ke realised that the number of gas masks available was very small, but nevertheless he would like to be able to send even a small consignment.The Cabinet were reminded that during the Abyssinian crisis a certain number of gas masks had been sent to Malta.    Possibly some of these, it was suggested, might be made available.The Cabinet were also reminded that at anearlier stage the International Committee onNon-intervention had agreed in principle that therewas no objection to the   despatch of gas masks.The Cab net approved in orinciple the proposal for the despatch of a consignment of gas masks to Soain, provided it was not on too large a scale, and invited the Secretory of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange details with the Nome Secretary.
B&apos;S SITUATION   SPAIN.  ;rS BALEARIC  o LANDS. previous m erence  abinet 57(36) Bonelusion 9).6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported concern at the information he was receiving as to Italian activities in the Balearic Islands. He had suggested to the Admiralty thsit they should station a second ship in these Islands as he had received information that the British man-of-war which had been stationed there for some time had had a very good effect.In reply to a question, he said that the population of Majorca was probably tired of the war and there was a danger that it might opt for Italian nationality.The First Lord of the Admiralty was in favourof the scheme in principle, if it was found practicable.The Cabinet approved in principle the proposal that a second British ship should be stationed in the Balearic Islands subject to its proving practicable.
IMPOSED ANGLO  r^ENCH CONSULTATIONS, previous reference Cabinet 62 (36) Conclusion 4).7.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that if the proposals for mediation in Spain were to break down, the continued arrival of foreign volunteers in Soain was likely to prove very awkward. There might be a case for inviting the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to visit London to discuss the question.    The opportunity of such a visit might also be convenient for discussing the question of 3elgium and the French import quotns.He recalled that not lon^ since M. Blum had expressed a wish to take a holiday in England. He himself had discouraged it at the time, but this had not been well received by M. Blum.He did not, ask for a decision that day but warned the Cabinet that he mijht have to raise the matter later.In the course of a short discussion, the suggestion was made that any vi3it from the French Government had better be postponed until further progress had been made with the negotiations for improving relations with Italy since, as shown by recent telegrams, the Italians were not well disposed towards any association of the French Government in any Declaration that might be reached and they might view with suspicion the French visit.The Secretary of 3tate for Foreign Affairs did not anticipate that the Italian negotiations would come to fruition for another fortnight and rather demurred to the postponement.The Cabinet took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs might raise this question later.-10-

Owing to his oreoccuoation with the question dealt with in Conclusion 1, he had not yet been able to finish it.    Te would be glad if the matter could be oostnoned.The Cabinet agreed -To postpone consideration of this question for a week.-11-

Attached to the Memorandum was a summary of the main provisions of the proposed Bill.    The Seoretary of State also sought authority to make an announcement, at such time as seemed appropriate, that legislation was to be proceeded with.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not object to the proposal in the Bill, but wished to place on record that he must not be taken as agreeing to the implication in paragraph 2 of CP. . 333 (36) that the decision to proceed with legislation dealing with Scottish agricultural wages should be linked up with the policy on the whole cereals position.Subject to this the Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for Scotland set forth in CP.  333 (36) and summarised above.

In addition it was intended to provide that no transfer of documents in the charge and superintendence of the Master of the Rolls should take place without his previous consent.    As regards Edward I records (some nine documents) the Master of the Rolls agreed in principle that these might be returned to Scotland, as being properly Scottish records;    but he preferred that in this case there should be a definite amendment in the Bill and it was intended to provide for this.

Mr. Baldwin with his humble duty to The King1. This morning Mr. Baldwin reported to the Cabinet his interview with Your Majesty yesterday and informed his colleagues that Your Majesty then communicated to him informally your firm and definite intention to renounce the Throne.2. The Cabinet received this statement of Your Majesty*8 intention with profound regret, and wished Mr. Baldwin to convey to Your Majesty immediately the unanimous feeling of Your Majesty&apos;s servants. Ministers are reluctant to believe that Your Majesty&apos;s resolve is irrevocable and still venture to hope that before Your Majesty pronounces any formal decision, Your Majesty may be pleased to reconsider an intention which must so deeply distress and so vitally affect all Your Majesty&apos;8 subjects.3. Mr. Baldwin is at once communicating with the Dominion Prime Ministers for the purpose of letting them know that Your Majesty has now made to him the informal intimation of Your Majesty&apos;s intention.9th December, 1936.
Mr.  Baldwin, with his humble duty to Your Majesty, with reference to his Submission of to-day feels It his duty to submit certain further considerations which arise in the event of Your Majesty persisting in the view expressed to him yesterday.Your Majesty anprecintes that the carrying out of Your Majesty&apos;s intention if persisted in necessarily involves the preparation of several documents of the highest importance for which no precedent exists, as well as the making of arrangements here and throughout the Empire.    These considerations make absolutely impossible an instnnt announcement of Your Majesty&apos;s decision, even if it were formally expressed.    These preparations are being provisionally pushed forward with all possible rapidity and Mr.  Baldwin will report as to their progress later to-day.Mr. Baldwin begs to point out that,  in the meantime, notwithstanding the intimation Your Majesty was pleased to make to him,  even though that intimation were more formally expressed, Your Majesty remains the constitutional Sovereign of the Commonwealth,  with all the duties attaching to that position.    This must continue to be until legislation has been passed to declare Your Majesty&apos;s Abdication and for purposes connected therewith. And inasmuch as all legislation must be passed by King, Lords and Commons, Your Majesty would be the Sovereign who would give the Royal Assent to this Bill.9th December, 1936.
ISHI PREMB MINISTBU told tne Cabinet of his Audience witn tae King on tne previous day and of tut present position,   He referred once more to tne importance of great secrecy at the present stage.Re nad found tne King in excellent health, lucid in his conversation, and well controlled, except on tue one subject witn which the&gt; were concerned toda^ . The King nad bee:, talking on the telephone to Mrs Simpson when Ml arrived, and came into tne room witn nign encomiums of the lady.On the general position all ne coal&apos; say was tnat everything hai happened exactly as he hsd apprehended in the development of public opinion.Hie talks with tne King had been sometimes alone, sometimes in tne presence of one or botn of tne brothers, sometimes Yr iv.onckton and Mr Allen had been present. de nad staged to dinner witn tut King.   Tnroujrnout tne King had been quite bright and cheerful.   de had tried his utmost to reason witn tne King, and nis efforts were recognised by Sir Reward Peacock, Mr Allen and the brothers of the King, all of wnom ha&apos; also tried tc   reason wit a him, but with tne same negative results. On leaving he had said to the King &quot;I suppose if an Arcnangel asked you to give up Mrs oimyson it would nave no effect?&quot;    &quot;Not the least&quot; replied tnt King. The King was longing to abdicate antf to sign and send a Message to Parliament.   There wae only One tuing left to be done. \.veanwnile Mr God -&apos;arc&apos;, Mrs Simpson&apos;s Solicitor, nad gone to Cannes to see nis client.    If tnat meeting snould by any  chance result in a decision on ner part to give the King up, there was every risk tnat tae King woul&apos;i at once proceed to Cannes b&gt; air if ne coulJ-1-
obtain an aeroplane.   Tnis olreumctance made it difficult to take a decision at the moment,   tie mignt get farther dMI in the course of the da^ .   Tne King iiad been in communication by telephone with tne ladj at Cannes and had probably told her about the Cabinet&apos;s advice on broad casting.   Tire American Prepo had reported that tne King had abdicated.   Tne Britisn Press was still seeping silent, but wanted to know where tnis news originated.   Tnt Dominions were beginning to pet restive.   He was quite convinced that noting could alter the King&apos;s mind and that his v.lanes would have to be met.   Mr Monckton and Sir Ednard Peacock, said the same.   Tne King&apos;s brothers knew tuat this affair could end in notninr ^ut miaerj and t&apos;isaster, but had not been able to persuade the King.   He tnougnt, tnerefore, tirat notning &lt;_oul~ be done to stop the King   nding nis Message to Parliament, but wnetner it would be on Tnursda,, or Friday was a matter for consideration. A great deal remained to be done and to be tnougnt out. He himself, after tnis last interview, nad now tne gravert doubts as to wnetner in any circumstance?, even if the King tnrew tne lad^ over and Wiiatever steps were taken, such as an interval for a rest-cure to restore nia perspective on tnis matter, tne King could recover his position or whether nis o n successor as Prime Minister would not later be confronted  ith equally difficult situations.   He Oeeply regretted tills.   He knew and admired the King&apos;s fine qualities, but doubted if, evien so, he could recover nis position. . In rcplj to a question ne expressed sc rlous apprehensions as to tne effect on tnt King if it turned out tnat tne divorce would not be completed.Iff CHAuBEHL/ IfJ said he kne* a good de*l about tnis matter and thought it very unlikely, from all accounts, tnat tne King would alter nis mind .   He would sa^-2-
&quot;I most live witn her all the Bare&quot;.    In rcplj to a question by Lord Zetland, Mr Chamberlain tnought tnat the probability of tne divorce being completed wae lees likely .w.r BDEN aeked on wnoae motractions Mr Goddard would be pressing renunciation on tne lady ITHE PRIME  .INISTBR eaid It would be on no-one&apos;s instructions.   He was ner legal s&apos;vicer, and as such wanted to Unow her intentions.SIR JuHN SIMON said tne first duty of tne lady&apos; a Solicitor was to watch over her interests intil ane obtained her divoroe.In reply to a question as to what would na*pen if tne King left the country. THS PKIMB MINISTER said it would be disastrous .Questions were also asked as to why Lor&apos;1 Bro*nlo*. a Lord-in-&lt;Vaiting to the King, wae acting aa tue mouthpiece of Mre Simpson witn tne Preas .   This gave the impression tnat tne King was concerned in Lntae anno an cements .TUB PRIME MINISTER said ne understood tnat tne King had agreed to Mrs Simpson&apos;s announcement.LORD SAINTON pointed out that if, aa the result of Mr Goddard&apos;a visit, the lady were to titndraw ner divorce proceedings and tne King were tnen to live witn ner witnout tneir being married, tnat would wnolly alter His Majesty&apos;s position vis-a.-vi3 yiblio opinion. Such action would be tantamount to all idea of marriage being given up.    .vnat would be tne effect of tn&amp;t, ne asked    on tne proposed abdication/THE PhlME MlNISTEh said vnat tne effect of that would nave to be seen on tne King&apos;s mind.   He doubted if it was likely to nappen.   He dii not think, that itrs Simp8on would tnrow tne King over.
C IK JO IN SIMON pointed oat taat even if Mr a 2 Lay on were to witndraw from the present divorce she migat still eatcrtain aopes of an American divorce at Keno.Mr CtiAbD^-KLAIN did not think taat the lady was lively to start bj ^itadrawiag ner suit.   She mlgnt want to know her financial poaitioa.    If tale was unfavourable, tne possibility could not be excluded that she mignt begin to make difficultiea .   She might urge the King to delay his abdication.   The only thing that might delav the King was pressure from ner, and she might want to know what her financial position was to be.   The country was ex &gt;eoting renunciation ami not abdication, and there might be an outburst if all tae,, got was the latter.   Peeling would be ver; strong, ia these clrcornstancee. against Mrs Simpson.TMI PKIMB MINISTSR said tne King nad been most anxious to sign nis Abdication tnat very day and. get it all over.   He himself ha* not accepted tnat.XT MALCOLM MACDoNALD said tnat Mr Mackenzie King nad at laat sent a message direct to tne Ki..g, in wnicn he recorder? taat he and his colleagues felt very deey sympatay * ith ine King&apos;s position but had no doubt taat intnis case dut^ outweighed the sacrifloe involved. In effect the telegram was in favour of renunciation, but was expressed with great cut ion.   He himself nad spo iea to the High Commissioners and to Mr Nash, tae New Zealand Minister of Finance.   Mr Nasa was definitely ia favour of the King&apos;s voluntary abdication, but taought tnat waatevtr course was adopted tae King would take a long time to recover nis poaj.tioa.   iar Druce an! Mr Vincent Massey neld tae same view.   Mr tc  attr t nought personally tiiat renunuiatioa was best, but *as uncertain if this would be tae view of tne Soutn African uovernment.   Lord. Partington hal telegrayued
from Australia that every hour increased the difficulty of tne King&apos;s recovering his position.LOUD ZETLAND said that abdication woul I be a tremendous snocfc. to In^is .   Tne Hindus woul^ not tolerate marriage with Mrs Simpson,   &quot;he Moslems ratner inclined to consider marriage to be the King&apos;s own affair.   All agrees tnat His Majesty&apos;s abdication would be a great shock.   The Hindus assumed tnat tne King&apos;s decision would be to allow uis inclinations to give way to duty.   Tne Moslems did not take tne same view.   The general trend of tue Press was to support tne attitude of the Government.THE PHIMB MINISTER said that if no information came in during the day tne onl.,  statement ne could make in Parliament tnat afternoon would be a definite announcement tnat ne hoped to be in a position to make a statement either on Tnursda,, or Friday .    It was impossible to make an announcement of the King&apos;s decision tne same day, as so much had to be done in tne waj of legislation, an:i so forth.   He asked wnat were tne views of hi  colleagues as to what he snould s*iy to tue King tnat da&gt; .Sin KINQSLKr #C(JD asked wn&gt; it was neeeesar, to wait for news from Cannes before waning an announcement?Mr CtiAMBSULA IN said tnat if, b^ anw  chance, Mrs Simpson intended to throw over the King and/or to proceed with her divorce, it might liter tne situation.SIR S/.MUBL H0AR3 sal-&quot; tnat if that happened no decision couli be announced at prtser.t.   He would prefer not to take a decision at tue uoment, as by doing so tne Cabinet would burn its boats and give txieir opponents an Opportunity of criticism. Motning would be gained bj promising an answer on tne morrow .-r&gt;-
All he would propose lo be said In Parliament was tn*at tne Prime Minister would make a statement on tne ajorrow .1MB PRIMS MINISTER asked if he waa to tell the King tnat altnouph the Cabinet nad known of nia desire for  o hours, they  could not promise to make it public&apos;Mr MALCOLM MACDONALD said tnat the dcciaion must be announced to tne Dominions six or, preferably, eight noura before it was announced in Parliament, ao tnat they could arrange for simultaneous announcedents . Tne Prime Minister could justifiably tell tne King tnat for material reasons an immediate announcement was impracticable.THE PR3R MINISTER said tnat he had told tne King that the earliest possible date for an announcement was Thursday.SIR JQtlN SIMON said tnere were two questions(1) tfhat was to be said to the King&apos;and(2) tfhat was to be aaid to Parliament.So far as (l) was concerned tne Prime toiniater might till the King that abdication was a ne* event in nlatory and that ver,, elaborate arrangements were necessary . These had to be put in the font) of documents.     Tne Legal Advisers were all at work trying to draw up these documents, bit, as Mr Monckton could tell nim, tney would take time.    In addition, all the Dominions had to accept txiat tne proposed arrangements were in proper constitutional form.   So far as (2) was concerned, tne Statement in the House of Commons, he was disposed to apree with Sir Samuel  ioare.   tie doubted if tne county would be very annoyed if no answer were given at once. Admittedly feeling was growing, but tnt Priaie Minister&apos; l Statement cr. Monday nad been completely successful in allaying public opinion.   Re agreed tnere must be a-  S-
Statement on the morrow, but It need not necessarily be a Koyal Message.SIR KINGSLEY *uOD tnought that the Nouse of Commons would accept such a Statement.Mr STANLEY had no doubt tnat the vaat majority of the people were expecting the King&apos;s renunciation of the marrlape.    If tne Prime Minister announce i an early statement in Parliament, that was wnat tnej would expe ct.THE PRIME M IN IS TEH raised tne question of what he was to say if he were asked wnetner he oould confirmtthe American reports of tne King&apos;s abclc&amp;tion.SIR TfOMAS  IN J KIP said tnat if it were  Jecided at once tnat the least damaging course wae to accept abdication, everytnlnp, else would follow in due course.Mr ELLIOT tnought tnat tnis wae too grave a decision to be taken at a single Meeting of tne Cabinet. Such precipitancy would look bad in later ,/eare .   He tnougnt tnat the least tne Cabinet could do was to beg tne King to reconsider nis decision, even tnou^n tne lineli.iood of his acceptance was admitted to be remote.Mr DUr&apos;P COOPER tnougnt it waa not for tne Cabinet to ea,, tnat abdication was the better course. This v.ae unnecessary.THB PRIME MINISTER said ne OA&amp;J asked if the Cabinet agreed in the King&apos;s wish to renounce the Tnrone.LORD ZETLAND aeked if tne Cabinet uere entitled to accept or rc je owlSilt SQUM SIMON sal&quot; that when tne King expreeeed his desires it was for the Cabinet to advise him.Mr MALCOLM MACDONALD aaid that this waa tne position of tne Dominion Governments also*   He himself had assumed that at the present stage tne King&apos;s statement of nis desires nad been informal.   Tnere nad been an informal intimation,   &quot;&quot;he moment it became for.ial-7-
the Kinp, was boon&apos; to send it to the Dominions also. He had hoped tnat 11 was informal, in which case tne Prime Minister might inform the Dominion Prime Ministers of it and get taeir reactions.THB PRIMS MINISTRY said taat if that was to be done tne message mast be sent at once.Mr CHAMBSRLf IN soggeete* tnat th    attitude of tne King towards ab&apos;icatioa created a difficult position for the Government,  no were not boond to express an opinion.    In saying tnis, he said he v.as opposing tne vie* of his legal colleagues.SIR JOHN SIMON said ne did not altogetner din seat. He rec lle* tnat the Prime Minister oa Monday nad anaouaeed ia effect tiiat tae King&apos;s decisioawas being awaited.   Rvea if the King were to annouace abdicatioa publicly it could not take effect until tae governments concerned had taken certain action.   He saoald be toll taat an / ct wool&quot;? have to be passed waicn would require his o* it assent;   that in fact he did not cease to be King until tne necessary legislation had been passed.SIR THOMAS INS^IP tnougat tuat Jir Joan Simon nad been ripht in the first instaace.   Tae King could not possibly say &quot;I abdicate&quot;,   until Parliament altered tne Act of Settlement &apos;e.g., regarding tae successioa to the Throne) he wool* remain 0e_ jure King.    It migat, in certain circomstances, be necessary for tne Government to oppose abdication   for example, in the case of one of the Dominions wanting to seize tne opportonit,, to become a republic.   For instance, suppose King William and Qoeen Mary had wanted to renoance tne T.ufone in favoor of tae Pretender, the Government and parliament might well nave takea that attitode.    If it coald be tne doty of the Governmeat in certain circornstances to forbid abdication, it Bight also be tatir doty to advise it.-b-
LOUD HALIFAX asued wait tae position would be if the King rejected the Gov eriiment&apos;s advice/S In THOMAS INSKIP said that In tnat event the Goveriiment might nive to resign.LOKD HALIF/X said uis own view was that abdication was the best tninp for txie nation and tne Empire, but he attached great importance to tue manner in wnicn tnis was a ceo vlisned .   ^ agreed witn  r Billot.   He would like to exprtss to txie King tne deep regret of tne Cabinet at tne step he proposed to take. Admittedly the King would probably not be influenced tnercby  , Meanwaile he would like to communicate tne position to the Prime Ministers of tne Dominions and to ascertain what was going on at Cannes.    In trie meantime ne would prepare the ground for a Statement on tne morrow .Mr QRMSBY-uOttS tnourht tnat in addition to receivingthe King&apos;s intimation of his desires with r&lt; gret, v-neCabinet should advise renunciation.&lt;T^tf       apt agreed VQtyMr ELLIOT thought that tne Cabinet snould expressasktneir regret an* consternation, an&apos; axxixx tne King to reconsider his decision.SIU SAuriUBL HOAKB recalled tnat tne Instrument of Abdication, wuich had been drawn up by the Cabinet Corrj&amp;ittee, gave the impression tnat it took *lace on tne King&apos;8 initiative and had notuing to do with any advice from the Cabinet.Mr CHA*;B 2RLAIN said tnat an expression of regret would not carr^ witn it trie necessity for resignation by the Cabinet if tne King disregarded it.SIR JOHN SIMOIJ recalled tne follow lug sentence intue Prime Minister&apos;s announcement on Monday&quot;Tne subject has, tncrefore, been for some time in tne King&apos;s mind, and as soon a3 His Majesty has arrived at a conclusion as to the course he dt sires
to take he will no Coubt communicate It to nie Governments in tnis country and tne Dominions.   It will men be for tnoee Governments to decide wnat advice, if any, they would feel it txieir dutj to tender to him in tne lignt of nis conclusion&quot;.He nimsclf had assumed tnat tne only advice would bethat a Bill snould be passed .Mr MALCGLiv- MACDONALD eal &apos; mat If t nc King a coouuunl-sentcation was formal it should be &amp;xxxxkXx*kxx by nim at tne same time to the Dominions;    if it was informal, the Prime Minister could notify them.   There were advantages in keeping the matter on an informal footing at present. Tnis would enable the Prime Minister to send an informal communication to the Dominions.   Tne next stage wouli be a Royal Message from the King, sent simultaneously to the Govern ent here arid to tne Dominions .   He tnougnt llast the reply to the King should be on tne lines 8 urges ted by Lord Halifax, tnat is to say, to tell die majesty tnat his forr.al communication must go to tne Dominions.THIS PR CMS MINISTER said tnat, in view of tne greatpressure- on ms time and tne many matttrs to be decided,ne waa anxious to avoid another Journey to Fort Delvederethat day, if possible.   He thought, therefore, tnat awritten communication might be sent to the King, whichwould be so *orded as to avoid snj possibility of givingumbrage to the Dominions.   &quot;&quot;nis 09*16 be taken to tneKing by Mr Monckton.iv.r MALCOLM MA.CDUnALD was certain a message to tnis effect coul* be framed.Mr 3LLI0T sugreated that the line snould be tnat proposed by Lord Halifax.SIR SAMUEL HOARB tiiought tnat the Cabinet ought to see the document before it waa actually despatched.-10-
SIR JOHN SIMON then read a first draft of a communication which the Prime Minister might send to the King to the effect that the Prime Minister had laid before the Cabinet that morning the information which His Majesty had communicated informally, but quite definitely, of his intention to relinquish the Throne.       He would add that he was informing the Prime Ministers of the Dominions of this informal communication.     Notification of the King&apos;s informal decision would be from Prime Minister to Prime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said the statement might include an expression of regret at the King&apos;s decision. He asked Sir John Simon to continue working on the draft.LORD ZETLAND presumed that he could make a similar communication to the Viceroy of India. THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD asked if the communication should not go beyond an expression of regret. Should the Cabinet not ask the King to reconsider his decision?MR. STANLEY thought that this would be very valuable for history.THE PRIME MINISTER said that such a communication would involve a reply.     Could he now promise to make a statement in Parliament on the morrow?MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that that would Involve the King signing an Instrument of Abdication tomorrow morning.- 11 -
MR. MALCOLM MACDONALD recalled that the Cabinet Committee had thought that, on the whole, the best time for an announcement of the King&apos;s decision would be about 10 p.m.     One reason which led to that idea was that 4 p.m. would be a very bad time from the point of view of the Dominions.LORD SWINTON said the important thing was that the United Kingdom Government should not hear of the King&apos;s informal decision before it was sent to the Dominions.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that 10 p.m. had been selected as the time, partly because it was the nearest hour at which simultaneous announcements in all parts of the Commonwealth could be made, and, secondly, because the announcement would appear first in the morning papers instead of in the evening papers.THE PRIME MINISTER attached little importance to the latter reason.If the announcement were not made until 10 p.m., it would mean a Debate going on all night.LORD HALIFAX suggested that 7 p.m. would be better for the House of Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER thought there would be objections from the Parliamentary Opposition and the Government&apos;s critics.MR. DUFF COOPER suggested 4 p.m.THE PRIME MINISTER asked that the Cabinet Committee should again consider the time-table.SIR JOHN SIMON asked if the Cabinet were assuming that a Royal message would become the subject of a Debate.THE PRIME MINISTER asked that the Cabinet Committee should work out these aspects of the- 12 -
programme the same afternoon.      It was important nowto get off the telegrams to the Dominions and to geta message to the King about lunch time.MR. MALCOLM MACDONALD said that all fourDominions were agreed on the procedure and thatMr. de Valera was, he thought, doing his best to help.(The Prime Minister withdrew at this point to keep an engagement with the Duke of York. In his absence, the Lord President of the Council took the Chair and the Cabinet proceeded to discuss their Agenda Paper. After the completion of the Agenda Paper, the discussion continued.)SIR JOHN SIMON, who had been drafting amessage to the King, said that the Cabinet ought tobear in mind the procedure to be adopted in Parliament.In his view, the proper course was that when the Kingwas Initiating something, he should send a Royalmessage to Parliament and that this should be followedby an address from Parliament that the Royal messagewould announce to both Houses the King&apos;s decisionand would attach a signed Instrument of Abdication.That could not properly form the subject of a Debate,but the Prime Minister would then intimate that theGovernment would move an address which would containan expression of the nation&apos;s regret at the King&apos;s Act. 1The Prime Minister would then make a speech moving theaddress and other speakers could follow. Afterwards,would come the Bill which was consequential and whichmight be taken on Monday.     He did not ask the Cabinetto discuss that proposal now, but to turn it over intheir minds,SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought that theGovernment would not get away with that proposal.- 13 -
SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that this proposal illustrated the necessity for the House of Commons to express some opinion.     It was tantamount to the Government giving to Parliament and to the King some advice as to whether his abdication should proceed.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that immediately after the Prime Minister&apos;s statement, the Government&apos;s critics would move:   That this House now adjourn and there will follow a Debate.MR. MORRISON suggested that an. address was required even if it merely expressed regret. There would be an amendment praying His Majesty to reconsider his decision.     He suggested, therefore, that the Government&apos;s message should include that prayer.     The Prime Minister would then be in a position to say that the Government had done their best and wanted the support of the House of Commons.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD pointed out that by that time the King would have abdicated.MR. CHAMBERLAIN demurred to the idea of the Cabinet tendering advice to the King and resigning if he neglected that advice.MR. DUFF COOPER said that what was proposed was not advice but an expression of opinion.MR. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that the Government should put themselves in a position of being able to ask the King not to abdicate.SIR JOHN SIMON then started to read hisstatement.(At this point,  the Prime Minister returned.) - 14 -
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Duke of York had not wanted anything in particular.     He and hi8 brothers had continuously urged the King to renounce the lady.     He had told the Duke of the proposed message to the King and that Mondey was the earliest day on which the King could abdicate. The Duke had replied that Monday was his birthday and that he had been named Albert because on that day the Prince Consort had died.     He added that if he came to the Throne, the Duke of York intended to assume the name of George.SIR JOHN SIMON then read his first draft of the message to the King.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the message should be confined to the first paragraph stating that Mr. Baldwin had informed his colleagues of the King&apos;s firm and definite intention to renounce the Throne and the second paragraph intimating the Cabinet&apos;s regret;    their reluctance to believe that the King&apos;s resolve was irrevocable and their hope that, before the King took a final decision, His Majesty would be pleased to reconsider his intention which must so deeply distress and so vitally affect all His Majesty&apos;s subjects.     He thought that the references to the means by which effect would have to be given to the decision and the communications to the Dominions, should be omitted.MR. MALCOLM MACDONALD wished to keep in the references to the Dominions.SIR JOHN SIMON then re-read his draft omitting the passages relating to the measures for carrying out the King&apos;s decision.- 15 -
THE PRIME MINISTER said the message should he proceeded by the usual phrase:    &quot;Mr. Baldwin with humble duty to Your Majesty&quot;.       With this addition he thought the draft was suitable.LORD HALIFAX asked what steps the Prime Minister contemplated in order to enable the Cabinet to reach a decision that night.THE PRIME MINISTER supposed that an answer would come from the King.LORD HALIFAX asked the Prime Minister for a copy of what he proposed to say to Mr. Attlee.1 , Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.
