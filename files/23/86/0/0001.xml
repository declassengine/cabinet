PROPOSED CONFERENCE rt&apos;ITH THE LOCArvNO POWERS.\ Preparationsfor.(Previoas Reference  Cabinet 5b (35) , Conclusion 3 .)1. The Cabinet had before them tne following Memoranda bj tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs:-C.P.-258 (36) and C.P .-2b* (36) circalating in combined form recent correspondence regarding tne preparations for tne proposed Conference of tne five Locarno Powers:C.P.-27b (36)  circulating a statement comparing tne views of tne different )2- Governments concerned, and pointingoat tne difficulties liKel,, to arise.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said tnat he proposed to send out a Note to all four Powers telling them tnat as a result of our collation certain major points emerged on wnicn tnere was a divergence of views .   In enumerating tnese points he proposed to limit himself to tnose mentioned in paragrapns 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5 of nis  covering note to C.P.-27b (36) . The Note would tnen invite tne views of toe four Governments as to now tnese points of disagreement could best be reconciled.   Tney would be asKed, also, wnether tnis further exenange of views snould be carried on tnroagn tne diplomatic cnannel, as at present, or wnetner tnere snould be a meeting. He would conclude tne Note by saving tnat we ourselves would very shortly be ma King a furtner communication to tne four Governments, giving our views of tne matter.   Tms procedure would give us ti.me to stud,y tne ueports of tne Committee of Imperial Defence and to clear a,  certain points witn some of tne Governments concerned.   It would nave tne advantage of Keeping ti-^e ball rolling, wnile at tne same time avoid our naving to formulate nurriedly our views on tne various questions, wnicn were of considerable importance and deserved, careful etaOj and. reflection.-1-
In the coarse of the discussion tne question was raised as to v.netner tne matter referred to in paragraph 4 of CP.-27a (36;, nameiy, tne question of wnether the disc^seion of an Eastern and Central European settlement should follow as a sequel to a Western settlement, and as to tne order of events, was not different in Kind from tne questions raised in tne other paragrapns referred to, namely, Article 16 of tne Covenant, tne position of the League Council, the guarantees and tne question of Belgium. It was suggested tnat it mignt be better to treat tnis as a question of handling tne Conference and not to ^ut it in tne category of joints of divergence. Our object, it was suggested, snould be to Keep tne question of tne order in wnicn these matters were discussed as fluid as possible, since our intention was to avoid putting so much prominence on tne Eastern settlement as to blocK tne way to a settlement in western Europe.The Secretary of &gt;-tate for Foreign Affairs pointed out that tne question was bound to be raised by some otner Government if it was not included i.i our uote . He would like to consider, nov. ever, unetner tne point snould appear in tne catalogue of pDints of major divergence or be dealt witn elsewnere in nis note. The Cabinet agreed  Tnat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs snould. send a Note to tne Belgian, French, German and Italian Governments on tne lines he proposed, as summarised above, subject to nis giving furtner consideration to tne question of wnether ne would include in the category of points of major , divergence tne difference between tne French and German point of view on tne manner in wnicn tne settlement of\ Eastern Europe was to be nandled in relation to tne settle exit of Western Europe; or, alternatively, wnetner ne snould refer to tne matter in a different part o f tne iiote .-2-
I5ITUATI0:. PAIN   vious erence: inet 5b 3ion 5.)said tnat in the Parliamentary Debate on tne following da,, ae proposed to give as fall an account as ue coald of tne origin of tne Non-intervention Agreement and tne establisnment of tne International Committee in S London.   He would point out tnat, in spite of rumours to tne contrary , tne initiative nad been taken by tne French Government.   He would, explain tnat tne main object had been the preservation of peace in Europe and tnat any other policy was less promising in this respect.   He would snow tnat, on tne wnole, tne result nad been mainly to tne advantage of tne Spanish Government.   He would speaK also of tne efforts of our Government in a humanitarian direction.Tne suggestion was made tnat tne Secretary of otate for Foreign Affairs snould express regret at tne tenor of t^e latest replj of the spanisn Government on tne humanitarian issue .The attention of tne Cabinet was drawn to references in tne Press of tne same corning      to tne critical attitude taKen up by Portugal towards tne handling of tne International Committee*   As tne insurgents appeared to be getting tne upper hand tnere would seem to be some danger tnat the civil war might end witn a Government in power in Spain tnat was somewnat resentful of our attitude, wnile Portugal was also critical.   Tnis might easily  give me Portuguese Govern.ent a pusn towards tne Fascist Governments of Europe.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Portugal had actually a teennical grievance in regard to what had occurred at tne International Committee.   He proposed to taxe a particularly friendly line in regard to Portugal in nis speech on tne morrow.-3-
rle would say tnat we nad no evidence of tne trutn oftne allegations against Portugal of sending aruis toSpain.   He explained that tiie International Committeenad adopted a rale tnat some member of tne Couiiuitteemust maKe himself responsible for any allegations tnatwere raised.   Tne original allegations against uermanjand Italy had. eo4.e from Spam, who was not a member oftne Committee.   Unless the Committee was to ignorethem, someone nad to taKe responsibility for tne^,and it was in these circumstances tnat tne 3ritisnCnairman had taKen tne responsibility, against WhichPortugal protested.   All other allegations, e.g., tnerecent one by tne Russian Govern.ent, nad beensponsored by a member of tne Committee, and in tnosecases tne Cnairman had merely received tne allegationson behalf of tne Committee and taken tne necessaryaction to lay tnem before tnem.Tne Cabinet agreed  To approve tnu general line vvnicn the Secretary of itate for Foreign Affairs proposed to adopt in regard to opanish affairs in tne forthcoming Parliamentary Debate, as summarised above .
I SPAIN.Bossible Conveyance of Mussian ArmsI BritishShiys .3      Tne First Lord of the Admiralty said tnat the Commander-in-Cnief in the mediterranean was anxious as to the situation wnicn would arise if British ships uere used to carry Russian arms and munitions of war to the Spanish Crovenmient, as tney might become liable to interception and capture by rebel cruisers, wnicn would raise considerable difficulties for our own men-of-war.Tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to tne Cabinet a Private and Secret letter, dated October 26, 193 6, received by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from tne British Embassy in Paris, reporting a conversation with M  Leger, of the Q,uai d&apos;Orsay , about tne change in the Russian attitude. The Cabinet agreed  That tne First Lord of tne Admiralty and the President of tne 13oard of Trade should confer, witn a view to a warning being issued to British snipping not to undertake tne conveyance of Russian war material to Spain.
JAPAN.Relations with.(Pr ev io ns reference: Cabinet 3 (35), Conclusion 5.)4. Tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported an episode tnat nad occurred during a recent visit of a Britisn flotilla to tne Port of Keelung in Formosa.   Some naval ratings nad been summoned fromj a cafe&apos; to a police station owing to tne police naving received a complaint from a taxicab driver tnat tney had not paid tneir fare.   Tnere was good evidence to Siiow tnat the fare agreed uton nad actually been paid, but tne police nad kept tne men in tne police station for xiours and had brutally assaulted tnem, even fracturing tne jaw of one .ran.   A British Naval Officer ixi uniform who intervened was grossly insulted and was ultimately obliged to advise tne men to make a false confession in order to secure tneir release. Tne incident was so outrageous tnat tne Secretary of state nad tnougnt it essential to tane a strong line;    all the more so as tne benaviour of tne Japanese police had been a matter for grave complaint for years.   As tne Japanese had refused to mane proper redress or to go beyond promising an inquiry, ne had felt it necessary .to s\op a forthcoming visit of tne Britisn Fleet to Japan, wnicn tne Japanese were looking forward to and for wnicn tney nad. made considerable preparation.   Originally it nad not been intended to publish tne reason for tne postponement of tne visit, but owing to a leaitage tnrougn Press Agencies in tne Far East it nad been necessary to issue a commanjq ue on tne previous d&amp;j .The First Lord of tne Admiralty agreed with tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tnat tne postponement of tne visit had been unavoidable.A question was raised as to wnetner tnis was an opportune liiOment to ask tne Japanese wnetner tney-6-
proposed to baild skips with 14 inoh guns in accordance with the recent Naval Treaty (to wnich tne,, were not a party) or to mount 16-incn guns.    it was admitted tnat tne moment was not particularly opportune from a diplomatic point of view, bat from a Naval point of view it was essential to ascertain immediately what attitade tne Japanese intended to adopt, if our own program .e was not to be bally neld up.   Moreover, tne latter subject was a technical one wnicn ought not to impinge apon tne other question, Which was political in character.
IPALESTINE. Question of temporary Suspe.-sion of Immigration. Disarmament. (Previous Reference: Cabinet 5b (3 3) , Conclusion 7 . j5.   The Cabinet had before tneia tne followingMemoranda by the Secretary of State for tne ColoniesCP.-269 (36),/  containing a comprehensive review of tne question of temporary suspension of immigration in Palestine, and recommending tnat he should be authorised to inform tnt High Commissioner that sucn a step would not be justified while the Royal Commission was at worK and tneir Aeport was under considera-tion, and that ne snould taite a   definitely  conservative view inestimating tne economic absorptive capacity of Palestine for tne purpose of fixing tne labour schedule for tne period October 1933 to inarcn 1937:C.P.-2a5 (36)  circulating copies of an important letter from Dr. weizmaun, on behalf of tne Jewish Agency for Palestine, pointing out tneir objections to a suspension of immigrat ion during tne Royal Commission&apos;s Inquiry; and furtner correspondence with tne siicn Commissioner in wnicn me latter proposed a labour schedule of l,bOO   1,300 to be allotted to the Jevisn Agency, and 500 to tne Inmdgration Depnrt..ie nt.CP.-272 (36) and CP.-286 (36) circulating correspondence with the Hi^h Commissioner for Palestine on the subject of proposals for disarmament in that country.     The final view of the High Commissioner was opposed to the disarmament by force either of the Jews or the arabs in the existing circumstances.The Secretary of State for the Coloniespointed out that the information in CP. 285 (36)had been received subsequent to the circulationof his memorandum CP. 269 (36), but had neverthelesstended to reinforce the views expressed in the latter.After summarising the High Commissioner&apos;s proposalsas to the amount of immigration to be allowed underthe Labour Schedule, he warned the Cabinet againstconsidering the situation in Palestine to besatisfactory.     In this connection, he read atelegram from the General Officer Commanding dated_ 8 -
26th October, 1936, in which it was pointed out thatthe Arab Organisation remains   intact and iB collectingfunds;    that the National Committee is in closetouch with armed bands and the Higher Committee inJerusalem; that bands are in armed occupation inpart of the country and can be reinforced at shortnotice from the villages;    that military operationsagainst the bands, due to begin at once, had beenreduced greatly in scale through political reasons;and that meanwhile the Arabs regarded the period asan armistice.       The Secretary of State took theview,  therefore, that if we were to carry out thenecessary task of re-establishing our prestige inPalestine, we must take a firm line and maintain asubstantial garrison there until the Royal Commission&apos;sreport had been received and dealt with. Meanwhiledisarmament of the Jews and Arabs could not beproceeded with.     If the Cabinet approved, heproposed to announce his policy on all these matterson the 5th November.     He also proposed that theRoyal Commission should sail at once.     The HighCommissioner would be the first witness in Palestine.After he had given evidence, it was proposed torecall him to this country to discuss various mattersincluding the question of disarmament, on which theHigh Commissioner and the General Officer CommandingThe High Commissioner did not appear to see eye to eye.    /     was satisfiedthat the Royal Commission was able to function andhoped to be able to maintain order.     The Chairmanof the Royal Commission was anxious to proceed asrapidly as possible.     This was a matter of greatimportance as, until our policy was completelydecided, the situation would be very difficult.Up to now we had not really had a very long range- 9 -
policy with the result that &quot;both Arabs and Jews had been in a state of great uncertainty.     After receipt of the Royal Commission&apos;s report, he hoped to be able to obtain a considered policy for the future.In the course of the discussion, it was pointed out that while firmness was absolutely necessary, it was essential that we should be scrupulously fair to both sides.     The Arab Kings and Governments (apart from some of Nuri Pasha&apos;s proceedings) had behaved very well.     Nuri Pasha at Geneva had tried to obtain some undertaking from the Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs, but the latter had only promised that justice would be done to both parties.     It was suggested that the High Commissioner&apos;s proposals to admit   1F00 Jewish immigrants under the Labour Schedule (i.e. 40 per cent, of the previous Schedule) would not be construed by the Arabs as giving justice to them for the reason that only one-sixth of the total immigration into Palestine was included in the Labour Schedule.     The total immigration, including persons with capital and dependants, was very much larger.     It was urged that the reduction, whatever it might be, should be a real one and not confined to the Labour Schedule and should be extended to the other categories.     In support of this view, it was pointed out that Italy&apos;s policy was to get the Arabs on her side and that any partisanship by the British Government of the Jews aided this policy.     The Cabinet were reminded that the Jews were not acting wisely in pressing for so much immigration as it was re-acting on them elsewhere. For example, there were 100,000 Jews in Iraq where- 10 -
there were signs cf an Anti-Semitic Movement.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that,in present circumstances, it was inconceivable that the figures for Jewish immigration could be large. Admittedly, there had been some laxity in the admission of dependants and the number of these hud become swollen.     The policy of the Jewish Agency in the last year or two had been to press forward with immigration partly to enable the Jews to defend themselves, and the numbers of immigrants had been maintained by the admission of the dependants of those already admitted, and now the procedure as regards dependants was being tightened up.     He was prepared, if pressed   by the Cabinet to do so, to tell Doctor Weizmanthat it was undesirable to bring in too many capitalists at the present time.In regard to the capitalists, the Cabinet were reminded that the Arab grievances largely centred on the ownership of land and that a considerable proportion of the capitalists purchased land.     It was also suggested that the funds of the Jewish Agency were placed temporarily at the disposal of capitalists until they could obtain their capital from their countries of origin.The Secretary of State for War hoped that no gesture would be made to the Arabs who had lately been in rebellion. Owing to the way these questions had been handled?    the   Arabs had emerged from the rising with considerable prestige, which they owed partly to the Arab Kings,     He recalled that the original idea of the Cabinet had been to keep the Arab Kings out of the dispute.     In the recent settlement, however, the Arab Kings could claim to- 11 - J1
have had a hand in the result.      One consequence of the policy pursued had been that the troops had never been employed under effective conditions, that is to say, under Martial Law*The question was raised as to whethor the Secretary of State for the Colonies proposed to announce on the 5th November that the High Commissioner had already decided on the limited quota referred to in the papers before the Cabinet, or whether he intended to announce the policy of restriction of immigration*The Secretary of State for the Colonies said he did not propose to announce any change in policy.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, as a former Secretary of State for the Colonies, agreed that a very large reduction is likely to take place in tne number of Jewish immigrants9     The tightening up of the rules for dependants would exercise considerable effect in this direction.     He pointed out that if restrictions were applied to the immigration of the capitalist class, the Government would be altering the policy before the Royal Commission had repar ted The Secretary of State for the Colonies added that if Jewish immigration was restricted, there would also be a demand for the restriction of immigration of Arabs who came in considerable numbers from Syria and elsewhere for the harvest of the citrus fruits.The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to produce a draft of his statement in Parliament for consideration at the next weekly meeting.- 12 -
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To accept the view of theSecretary of State for the Colonies that there should be no change in policy and no suspension of immigration. Ire* peHtiioal I&apos;g.aaavigi,(b) That the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should ask the view of the High Commissioner as to the possibility of reducing the Immigration of the capitalist class of immigrants, and as to whether, if he were completely free from any commitment in this matter, he would recommend a restriction on merits.(c)     That in reply to DoctorWeizmann&apos;s letter of the 26th October (CP.285 (36) and Appendix) the Secretary of State for the Colonies should point out that, in addition to the pledge contained in Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s letter which is mentioned in Doctor Weizmann&apos;s (though not in quotations) in regard to Jewish immigration, there is another side of the question which was also mentioned in , Mr. MacDonald&apos;s letter, namely,A   ^ojJroo   the/arfrgtw.gpation of non-Jewish elements.
THE KING&apos;S SPEECH CN THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 5b (36) , Conclusion 8.)6   Tne Cabinet had before tneu a draft of tne King&apos;s Speech on tne Opening of Parliament on November 3rd, 1936 (attached to C.P .-279 (36))  in tne form suggested by the Cabinet Committee.The Speech submitted by tne Cabinet Committee was criticised owing to its length, particularly in tne &gt;. Coronation year.    It was suggested tnat tne programme involved was impossible of realisation in tue pre sent Parliament.   While it was admitted tnat tne Speech was a long one, it was pointed out tnat ratner an unusual number of paragraphs had to be given up to foreign affairs and otner matters of tnat Kind, and tnat tne progra:;.me was not unmanageable. Moreover, it was very difficult to select any passage for deletion.   Several suggestions in tnat direction were rejected.    The Cabinet were informed tnat tne minister of Transport would lixe to include a passage on the subject of Electricity Distribution, but as, by general consent, tnere was no probability of passing a Bill in the fortncoming Parliamentary year, it was decided tnat it would nave to await its turn in a later year.   Tne Prime Minister indicated tne possibility tnat ne mignt refer to tnis matter in moving tne Address .The Cabinet tnen considered, first, amendments proposed by tne Chancellor of tne Exchequer, as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee, and afterwards the. suggestions of otner members.The Cabinet approved the draft of tne King&apos;s Speech, subject to tne follow ing:--14-
Pace 1. Tentn paragrauniAfter the Secretary of State for India hadinformed tne Cabinet of tne tenor of aconversation ne had had with tne King, tneparagraph was amended to read as follows,subject (like txie remainder of tne Speech)to liis Majesty&apos;s approval:-&quot;It is My nope, wnen tne solemnity of My Coronation nas been celebrated, to revisit My Indian Dominions and tnere to maxe known, in tne same manner as My revered Fatner, to the Princes and Peoples of India, My succession to the Imperial Crown&quot;.Page 2. First paragraph,, line 3:&quot;I welcome tne recent improvement in the situation and nope that tne members of tne Royal Commission which I have appointed will be able in tne near future to begin tneir inquiry in Palestine&quot;.This sentence, and more particularly tne words &quot;and hope&quot;, were left to tne Chancellor of tne Exchequer in consultation with tne Secretary of State for tne Colonies, wno would decide tne wording according to tne precise position in tne .matter of the Royal Commission&apos;s departure.Page 2.   Third paragraph^   After some discussion tne Cabinet agreed to omit tne following words:-&quot;although the difficulty of obtaining recruits for tne Regular Army and the Territorial Arm,/ has not jet been overcome&quot;.Page 2.   Sixth paragraph:The precise wording was left to tne Chancellor of tne Exchequer to settle, dependent upon whether a decision nad been taxen before tne Opening of Parliament to continue tne Tramp Snipping Subsidy, and upon tne precise position as to the Report of tne Imperial Snipping Committee.Page 2.   Seventh paragraph:The Cabinet toox note of tne warning of the Chancellor of the Exchequer tnat, in order to bring about trie unification of coal royalties under natioxial control, compulsion would be necessary.-15-

Last paragraph,:An amendment which tne minister of Agriculture and Pisneries wisned to make to tnia paragraph was left for settlement between tne wiinister and the Chancellor of tne Exchequer.Page 5.   Second paragraphTne Cabinet tooK note tnat tne words&quot;I am impressed with tne need for more comprehensive efforts to improve tne pnysical condition of tne nation&quot;, etc.,involved a slight departure from tne usual practice, insomucn as tne King was asKed to express a personal view instead of tne view of his Ministers.    In tne present case tnis was felt to be appropriate.Page 5.   Fourtn oaragraun:The precise wording of tnis paragraph wasleft to the Chancellor of tne Exchequer,in consultation with tne Minister of HeaLUh.Page 3 [   Sixth paragraph (Extension of the Unemvlo.v-ment insurance Act) :No decision was taKen on this provisional paragraph as it depended u^on a decision to be taken on another item of the Agenda Paper which was not reached tnat morning.Page 3.   Seventh paragraph   (Ministers&apos;  Salaries) Although tnis matter had not been mentioned hitherto at the Cabinet, tnere was general agreement witn the Cabinet Committee tnat advantage ought to be taken of tne present favourable opportunity to remove tne anomalies in tnis matter as well as in respect of Ministers&apos; pensions.

UNIFORM FOR THE ARMY.(Previous Rsference: Cabinet 58(36) Conclusion 15.)9      The Secretary of State for War said that he had prepared comprehensive proposals with a view to stimulating Army recruiting* These proposals were still under consideration in the Treasury and, under the Cabinet rules, he had not been permitted to lay them before his colleagues. One of these proposals was for the equipment of the Army with blue uniforms, which it was desired to carry out before the Coronation.     Unless he could get a decision on this matter now, the uniforms would not be ready in time. Consequently, he felt obliged to ask for a decision to-day though he would have preferred to have submitted this proposal as part of his complete scheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the amount of money that could be spared to aid recruiting was not unlimited and, if the proposal now before the Cabinet was approved, it must be on the understanding that he could no* increase the total sum available.The Secretary of State for India said that this proposal affected India and would Involve an initial cost of  150,000 as well as a recurring cost.     Blue uniform was unsuitable for ceremonial purposes in India and in large partB of the country it could not be used at all.     Consequently, the Indian Government were opposed to the proposal if any charges fell on the   Indian Revenue.The Secretary of State for War said that all his proposals would involve an incroase in expenditure in India.     Even if recruiting was maintained on its existing level, the numbers of recruits available would not be sufficient in 1940? to provide the garrison of India. Asa matter of fact, however, the numbers were- 19 -
falling and, if the garrison of India was to bemaintained, steps must be taken to stimulaterecruiting.The Secretary of State for India pointedout that British troops in India worked under morefavourable conditions for training than elsewhere.It was an advantage also from an imperial pointof view to have in India a large and well trainedfor example,body of troops.   In the late War,  /    British troops in India had been used at a very early stage for purposes of reinforcement.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that soldiers going to India might leave their blue uniforms in store to be handed over to a soldier returning home.     In that way expenditure in India might be avoided.Several members of the Cabinet urged that the recruiting proposals as a whole ought to be before them before they were asked to take a decision on any one of these proposals. They wished to be assured that the money was being employed to the greatest possible advantage. The suggestion was also made that public opinion would not welcome a heavy expenditure on ornamental uniforms at a time when shortages in the Service and material were known to be great.The Secretary of State for War pointed out, however, that it was no use making good the shortages in material if there were insufficient soldiers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested as a compromise that uniforms should be provided only for the troops to be employed in connection with the Coronation ceremony.       He understood that only- 20 -
30,000 suits would be involved.     He also mentioned that the uniforms were not of a new pattern, but could beready be purchased by the men and used for walking out purposes.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of theChancellor of the Exchequer that the Army Council should have authority to purchase and issue blue uniforms to troops taking part in Hie Coronation ceremony.(b) That no charge should be involvedto the Government of India,

VOLUNTARY INSURANCE OP BLACK-COATED v/ORKER^ FOR  VIDO.VS1 , ORPHANS&apos; AND OLD AGE CONTRIEUTORY PENS IONS .(Previoas Reference: Cabinet 14 (3 5) , Conclusion 7.)11,   The Cabinet had. before tnem a Memorandum by the Minister of Healtn (CP.-275 (35); setting fortn &apos; tne main recommendations of a Committee of Departmental Officials who had been entrusted witn tne formulation of a scneme of voluntary  insurance of blacx-coated workers and otners for widows&apos; , Orpnano&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.Remuneration f   Limit for Non-manual Workers.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 58(36) Conclusion 9 &amp; Appendix.)12.     The Cabinet had a short discussion on memoranda by the Minister of Labour (CP. 266 (36)) and the Minister of Health (C.Po 283 (36)) on the subject of Unemployment Insurance: Remuneration Limit for Non-manual Workers, but, as the time available was short, did not pursue the matter very far.
THE CORONATION CEREMONi&quot; .Second Report of Cabinet Committee.I(Previous Reference: &lt; Cabinet Pl*^ (36; , Conclusion b .)I      13. The Cabinet nad before tnem tne Second ueport of tne Committee on tnt Coronation Oatn (C.P.-263 (35)), wnicn v.as concerned witn certain matters falling within tne second part of tne Committee&apos;s Terms of Reference, viz.:-&quot;The constitutional and otntr questions arising in connection witn the association of tne Dominions in tne Coronation ceremony&quot; (Cabinet 40 (36), Conclusion 1).Tne recommendations of tne Committee were summarisedat the end of their Report as follows(i)  In tne procession at tne beginning of the Coronation Service, from tne west door of  vest .inster Abbe,, to tne Cnoir, the Dominion Prime Ministers snould be placed immediately after tne Lord President of the Council and immediately before tne Prime minister of tne United Kingdom.(ii) Precedent should be followed as closely as possible witn regard to tne Standards to be carried in tnis procession; as regards the Standards of tne Dominions it snould be left to tne Dominion Governments tnemselves to decide by wnom tney snould be carried.(iii)  It will be a desirable innovation intne &quot;Recognition&quot; part of tne Coronation Service if (before the acclamations of tne people) it can be arranged for tne Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, and a member of tne Government of India, to give separate answers, eacn speaking as tne representative of nis country .After the Lord President of the Councilhad explained the proposals of the Committee, theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatthese proposals would have to be discussed withthe Dominions.     In the matter of &quot;Recognition&quot;, itwas unlikely that Mr. dd Valera would be preparedto give an answer but, in present circumstances,his abstention might not be very important. Itwould be more serious, however, if General Hertzogwas unwilling to participate.     8o far as India- 25 -
was concerned, he himself favoured in principle the proposal that a member of the Government of India should take part in the &quot;Recognition&quot; ceremony, but it was conceivable that some of the Dominion, prime Ministers might object.     Also, if Burma were included, a question would arise as to the inclusion of Southern Rhodesia. He suggested that if the Dominion   Prime Ministers accepted the proposal for themselves, the suggestion of including India should then be put to them, but that it should not be put to India until after their views had been ascertained.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out the importance that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom should act in the ceremony of &quot;Recognition&quot; for the Colonies and Protectorates as well as for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the recommendationscontained in the Second Report of the Committee on the Coronation (CP. 263 (36)) as set forth above.(b) That at the appropriate stage,Prime Ministers of the Dominions should be consulted about these proposals.(c) That the proposal that a member ofthe Government of India should participate in the &quot;Recognition&quot; part of the Coronation service in the manner proposed, should net be submitted to the Indian Government until the Prime Ministers for the Dominions had been consulted.(d) That the Prime Minister of theUnited Kingdom should qct in the ceremony of the &quot;Recognition&quot; for the Colonies and Protectorates as well as for Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that this should be male clear in the order of the ceremony.     It is essential that the whole Empire should be covered when the Dominions and India are separately represented.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 28th October, 1936.
