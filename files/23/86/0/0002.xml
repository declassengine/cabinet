the voluntary pensions scheme had been introduced&quot;In tne course of tne discission relerence was made to tne importance of tne Minister of Labour&apos;s proposal from the point of view of not rejecting a Report by tne Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee, which nad been a very useful body botn to tne Government as a wnole and to tiie Treasury .After so.&apos;.ie further discussion tne Cabinet agreed  (a) Tnat no mention should be made in tne King&apos;s Speech of proposals to extend the Unemployment Insurance Act to cover persons engaged in non-manual o ccapations:(b) That tnt above decision should be without prejudice to an examination of tne proposal at a more appropriate opportunity .
