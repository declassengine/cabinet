THE PIVE-POWER CONFERENCE.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 66 (36), Conclusion 2.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet that the Memorandum approved at the Meeting referred to in the margin had been communicated to the French, Belgian, German and Italian Governments.    The French Ambassador had informed him that the Memorandum would be agreed as a basis for discussion and that in the near future the French Government would send a note of approval. The German and Italian Governments had not yet replied, but the first indications of their attitude were not unfavourable.
THE SITUATION IN SPAIN.Question of Belligerent Rights.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 66 (36), Conclusion 3. )THE MERCHANTSHIPPING(CARRIAGE OP fMUNITIONS TOSPAIN) BILL.2- The Cabinet had, before them the followingdocuments on tha situation in Spain and the questionof belligerent rights:-The Notes of a Meeting of Ministers (CP.-312 (36)) held at No.  10, Downing Street, on Sunday, November 22nd, at 4.30 p.m., circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister. The Conclusions reached at the Meeting were summed up as follows:-(a) The general policy of the Government is one of a continuance of Non-Intervention, that is to say to take*..A /if) n0 part in the conflict on either side.(b) In pursuance ol this policy, it is the intention oi His Majesty&apos;s Government that British shipping should not carry war material to any port in Spain.(c) The best method of securing this is to legislate so as to ensure that British ships do not oarry arms and ammunition to any Spanish port. This is analogous to the Foreign Enlistment Act.    The legislation should provide that it is illegal for a British ship, whether chartered or not, to do so.(d) The Foreign Secretary should the same evening send messages to the Spanish Government and to General Franco&apos;s Government announcing the above general policy and explaining that in addition to the action which His Majesty&apos;s Government have already taken to prevent the export of arms from this country to Spain, the:/ are considering what action they themselves can taketo prevent transport ol arms by British ships to Spain.(A copy of the telegram actually sent is attached in Appendix IV to C.P.-312 (36).)(e) The Foreign Secretary should, before making a statement in Parliament, consult the Board of Trade as to the feasibility oi the proposed legislation.(f) If possible, the Foreign Secretary shouldannounce the policy in the House oi Commons on the afternoon of Monday, November 23rd.(g) The Admiralty shoulu consider the issue of fresh instructions to the Naval Commanders-in-Chief concerned, in the light of the Statement to be made by the Foreign Secretary.-2-
A draft Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Munitions to Spain) Bill (C.P.-317 (36)), circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and framed to secure the objects mentioned in (c) above.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did not think it necessary to describe in detail what had happened on Sunday, November 22nd, as the Cabinet had received the Secretary&apos;s Notes of the Meeting of Ministers held on that evening (CP.-312 (36)). He said it would be necessary to watch for a favourable opportunity to confer- belligerent rights on both parties in the Spanish struggle.    In reply to a question as to what would be a &quot;favourable opportunity* he mentioned the fall of Madrid.The First Lord of the Admiralty did not like the idea of waiting for the fall of Madrid, which might perhaps be long postponed.    He suggested that the trade negotiations might perhaps provide an earlier opportunity.    The present arrangement could only be regarded as a stop-gao.   He was apprehensive as to embarrassments for- the future which might be created by the Bill.So far as the Bill was concernea, discussion focussed mainly on Section 2, the object of which was to check the use of the Eritish Flag by a foreign merchant ship carrying war material to Spanish ports. It was explained that if a ship flyinc the British Flag was suspected of being in reality a foreigner carrying arms, a British man-of-var would, by this Section, be empowered to visit her.    If she turned out to be a foreign ship the man-of-1 ar would, of course, give her no protection.    The general object of the arrangement was to put a stop to a ruse-de-puerre which otherwise might be used to frustrate the policy of non-intervention.-3-
The main critieisn; ot this Section was that it might easily result in irupairing the exercise of a right to vhich we ourselves, when a belligerent, had very frequently resorted, and to which we should, in the event of war, again have resort;    that is to say the use of a foreign flag by a merchant ship as a ruse-de-guerre.    The proposal was felt to create a most dangerous precedent.The Cabinet were informed that the legal advice had been that there would not be much aanger in this Section as a precedent provided that it was recognised to be only a stop-eap arrangement and did not continue too long.One suggestion was that the difficulty might be surmounted by altering the title of the Bill, or by a preamble to make clear that the whole arrangement was limited to the present crisis in Spain.The view of the Cabinet, however, was that safeguards such as those suggested above, however defensible they iidght be in theory, might w~ll in practice alter the situation and create precedents for corresponding action, mutatis mutandis, by neutral nations when we were a belligerent.It was pointed out that a foreign ship using theBritish Flag was either doing so in the exercise ofsome belligerent right oi otherwise.    If, as at present,neither of the two parties to the struggle in Spainwas recognised as entitled to belligerent rights, aforeign ship using the British Flag could be dealt withunder Section 69 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894,which was in accordance with recognised internationallaw.    If, later on, we were to recognise belligerentrights to the two parties in the Spanish strugglethe existence of this A&amp;t, might cause difficulties.K-4-
In all the circumstances there was reneral agreement that Section 2 should be deleted. The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the general policy adopted at the Meeting of Ministers held on Sunday, November 22nd at 4.30 p.m., as set forth in CP. -312 (36) and summarised at the head of this Conclusion:(b) To approve for introduction in the House of Commons the draft Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Munitions to Spain) Bill attached to CP.-317 (36), subject to the deletion of Section 2:(c) That the above decisions should be subject to the right of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the First Lord of the Admiralty or the President of the Board of Trade to call attention to any consideration that had been overlooked, and to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable:(d) That one of the Law Officers of the Crown and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade should take charge of the Bill in the House oi Commons.
I SPAIN.I The No rill interventionII Committee.B (PreviousI Reference: I Cabinet 66 | (36), Con-I    elusion 4.)3. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Foreign 01fice (The Right Hon. The Sari of Plymouth), who is the Chairman of the International Committee on Nonintervention, sitting in London, was introduced at the request oi the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for consideration of this item.The Eari of Plymouth reported that the Nonintervention Committee had reached a broad outline of a plan for enforcing non-intervention in Spain except that on the Air aspects of the question the matter was not quite complete.    Broadly, the proposal was to establish groups of agents at points of ingress on sea and by land.    The Committee had adopted the plan in principle and had referred it to their respective Governments.    It was agreed that the plan could only be applied provided both sides in the Spanish struggle would accept, which seemed very unlikely.    The Non-intervention Committee now wanted to put the arrangement in operation.    He asked if the Government would authorise him to make a statement to the effect that they approved it in principle and that it should be presented to both parties.    That would not commit the British Government as to the scale and scope of the arrangement, though the plan included a list of points where agents were urgently required and at which agents might therefore have to be supplied as a first step.    He could not postpone making a statement of the Government&apos;s policy much longer, as the general trend of view on the Non-intervention Committee was that, in the event of the two parties in Spain accepting the proposal, the nations ought to be ready to put it in operation at once.    The^&amp;ohiiiin(  was estimated to cost rather more than  1,000,000 in one year.    In the view of the-6-
BMifa Coiifidt&gt;te //thot had drawn it up, nothing less would be effective.    In the Non-intervention Committee the representatives of some nations had thought that its scope was too large and too costly.    The German representative had taken the opposite view and considered it was not large enough to be effective.   He was llkiely to be supported by the Russian representative in this view.    Of course no scheme could be effective without not only agreement but also co-operation from the parties concerned.    He asked whether, if other members of the Committee agreed in the plan, he would be authorised to approve it on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Gove i nment.In reply to a request for detailed information the Eai1 oi Plymouth added that under the proposed plan there would be a number of agents on the Spanish coast who would have the right to enter ports and search cargoes, reporting to the Non-intervention Committee, the Chief of his group, and to the Government of any ship which appeared to have broken the rule. The personnel would be drawn mainly from the non-interested Governments.    The lion&apos;s share of the cost would be borne by the countries &quot;&apos;hich were deemed to be most interested in non-intervention, namely, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the share of each of which would be about  160,000 a year. The remainder of the cost would be divided among the other nations in the same proportion as their contribution to the League of Nations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that there was a good deal ox manoeuvring for position going on among the different nations     on this question.-7-
The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that even if it was not very likely that the parties to the Spanish struggle would agree to the scheme, it was still loss likely that they would co-operate in working it.After Bouse further discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the ^arl of Plymouth should be authorised to inform the International Coiimittee on Non-intervention that Pis Majesty1s Government would agree in principle to the scheme for making non-intervention effective in Spain:(b) That at the same tiiae the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, through such channel as he might deem appropriate (not excluding the Chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee), should give a sharp reminder to certain Governments that notoriously were supplying war material t_ one side or the other, that this arrangement would be unnecessary if they would take steps to stop the exportation of arms to Spain from their respective countries:(c) That there was no objection in principle to the use of the Foreign Office channel of communication to the two parties inthe Spanish struggle, on the understanding* that the Secretary of State would only use good offices to pass on a communication issuing from the Chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee and the replies.(The Earl of Plymouth withdrew at the end of this item.)
I SPAIN.II Alarmist11 Atmosphere   I in the Press.4. The First Lord of the Adndralt.v drew the attention of the Cabinet to the alarmist atmosphere of the Pr^ss in matters connected with the Spanish Civil War.   He quoted two recent examples:-(1) The Press had suggested that some kind of a crisis had arisen between His Majesty1s Government and General Franco&apos;s Government.It was quite untrue, as suggested in the Press, thatGeneral Franco had rejected the British proposals,the fact being that he was in communication as to thepossibility of a safe area in Barcelona.(2) The scare headlines that morning, &quot;All Leave stopped at Malta&quot;.The fact was that a violent north wind, known as the&quot;Gregale&quot;, was blowing into the mouth of MaltaHarbour, creating a heavy sea, and, as usual, leavehad been stopped and no ship was allowed to depart.He asked that something should be done to check theserumours.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Press Department of the Foreign Office were always trying to check these objectionable practices. On recent occasions Router&apos;s Agency had been the cause of trouble.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should arrange for a Private Notice Question to be addressed to him on both the points mentioned by the First Lord of the Admiralty, and that in denying the accuracy of the Press rumours he should draw attention to the amount of harm that vas done by raising these scares:(b) That Reuter&apos;s Agency should not be mentioned by name in the Answer to the Private Notice Question proposed in (a), but that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should see the Head of Reuter&apos;s Agency and warn him that on a future occasion he could not undertake to omit a reference if that Agency continued to offend*-9-
IKE ARGENTINE, rade Agreement ith Previous Reference: &apos;abinet 59 (36) &apos;onclusion 2.)5.    The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that the negotiations with the Argentine Government had now reached the final stage and the draft agreement was ready for immediate signature.     Only one alteration of substance hud been made since the Cabinet approved the proposals.       The Argentine negotiators had agreed that if their Government had abolished exchange control, equivalent advantages would still be given to British exports.     This had proved impracticable.      Instead, the equilibrium clause would apply to this possibility and it had been extended to allow of short term denunciation of the Agreement if the matter could not be adjusted satisfactorily.On mutton and lamb, the proposed guarantee had been remitted to the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the President of the Board of Trade himself.     They had agreed that a settlement on the following lines should be offered to the Argentines:-(a) For the first year of the Agreement dutyfree entry and no cut on present quantities;(b) for the second year of the Agreement dutyfree entry and the right to impose a further cut not greater than 10% of the present quantities;(c) for the third year an undertaking that ifa cut greater than 10% of the present quantities were imposed or if the conditions governing the importation of Argentine mutton and lamb into the United Kingdom were otherwise altered by the United Kingdom Government, the equilibrium clause should apply.They had further agreed that if (c) provedinacceptable, there should be offered -For the third year duty free entry and an undertaking that if a cut greater than 10$ were imposed, the equilibrium clause would apply.- 10 -
The actual form of the guarantee now agreed was that imports of mutton and lamb from Argentina would not be reduced below 885,000 cwts. in 1937 and 796,500 cwts. in 1938,     We were free to impose a further cut in 1939 subject to the equilibrium clause.     This quantity guaranteed to Argentina was 4,000 cwts. larger than 65 per cent, of the so-called &quot;Ottawa standard year figure&quot;, but was less by about 6,000 cwts. than the actual Argentine imports in 1935.It was intended that the Agreement should operate retroactively from the 20th November, 1936, the date on which the Agreement for 1933 was terminated.The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, expressed great satisfaction at the conclusion of the Agreement.
THE INDIA AND BURMA (EXISTING LAWS) BILL.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 66 (36), Conclusion 7. )6*    The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India (H.A.-37 (36)) covering the draft India and Burma (Existing Lavs) Bill, the object of which was to remove certain points oi doubt arising on the construction   of Sections 292 and 293 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the corresponding Sections (148 and 149) of the Government of Burma Act.The Conclusions reached by the Committee of HomeAffairs thereon (H.a.C. 11th Conclusions (36),Minute l) were as follows:-1 (l) To take note that before the Meeting of the Cabinet the Secretary of State foi India would confer with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury on the question of whether the Bill should be introduced in the House of Lords or the House of Commons:(2) To recommend the Cabinet to authorise the introduction, with a view to its passage into law be&quot;ore 1st April, 1937, of the India and Burt a, (Existing Laws) Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-37 (36), subject to the amend** ments suggested at the meeting by the Solicitor-General, and to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable&quot;.The Secretary of State for India said thathe accepted the amendments proposed at theCommittee of Home Affairs.     He had conferred withthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury andthey had agreed that it would be advisable tointroduce the Bill in the House of Lords.
The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the introduction in the House of Lords, with a view to its passage into law before the 1st April, 19371 of the India and Burma-(Existing Laws) Bill In the form of the draft annexed to H.A. 27 (36), subject to the amendments suggested at the meeting of the Committee of Home Affairs by the Solicitor-General and to any drafting of other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable,,
THE PUBLIC WORKS LOANS BILL.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 58 (36), Conclusion 9 &amp; Appendix.)7. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (H.A.-38 (36)) covering the draft Public Works Loans Bill, the principal object of which was to finance the estimated requirements of the Public Works Loan Commissioners during the coming twelve months:   together with the following&apos; recommendation of the Committee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C.  11th Conclusions (36), Minute 2):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the Public Works Loans Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-38 (36), subject to any dr&amp;fting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or deeirable&quot;.The Cabinet approved the recommendation of the Committee of Home Affairs as set forth above.
THE VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA (LEGALISATION) BILL.8.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Health (C.P. -316 (36)) calling the attention of his colleagues to tbe Voluntary Euthanasia (Legalisation) Bill, the Second Reeding of which was to be moved by Lord Ponsonby in the House of Lords on December 1st.    The Bill provided that, subject to certain safeguards, a duly licensed medical practitioner might, at the request of any person of sound mind over the age of 21 and suffering from illness involving severe pain and of an incurable and fatal character, administer euthanasia, that is, might terminate life by painless means.    The Minister understood that great differences of opinion on this subject existed in the medical profession, and the Bill was certain to arouse controversy outside its ranks.    In the circumstances he suggested that the attitude of the Government towards the Bill receiving a Second Reading should be that whilst the question of whether it should receive a Second Reading or not was one for the House itself, no undertaking for facilities for the Bill could be given by the Government.The Cabinet agreed:That whilst the Second Reading of the Bill was one for the House of Lords itself, no undertaking for facilities for the Bill could be given by the Government.
THE annual holiday bill.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 66 (36), Conclusion 14. )9 ,The Cabinet had under consideration theAnnual Holiday Bill, introduced by a Private Memberand down for Second Reading in the House of Commonson Friday, November 27th.The Minister of Labour suggested that theBill should be dealt with by an amendment to bemoved by a Private Member on some such lines asthe following:-&quot;That this House, while welcoming the continuous development of the practice of granting holidays with pay and favouring the extension of this practice by voluntary agreement, declines to give a second reading to a Bill which interferes with the free negotiation of the terms and conditions of employment between employers and employed and pays no regard to the great variety of circumstances in the many different industries and occupations which would be affected,&quot;The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Minister of Labour as set forth above and authorised him to arrange for action accordingly.
I. HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS (GRATUITIES) BILL. (Previous Reference: Cabinet 66 (36), Conclusion 15. )10.    The Cabinet had under consideration the Hotels and Restaurants (Gratuities) Bill, introduced by a Private Member and down for Second Reading in the House of Commons on Friday, November 27th.The Cabinet were informed that the whole of the time of the House of Commons would be taken by the Annual Holiday Bill which came first on the Order Paper and that there was no prospect of discussion on the Hotels and Restaurants (Gratuities) Bill*     The matter was, therefore, not discussed.

SPECIAL AREAS.Allocation of Contracts to.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 57 (36), Conclusion 21. )14.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-315 (36)) covering a Memorandum on the Allocation of Admiralty Contracts to the Distressed and Special Areas, which showed that the Admiralty were doing their best to give work to these areas and had kept in the forefront the desirability of locating new Establishments in them.The question was raised as to what attitude the Cabinet intended to adopt in regard to the last Report of the Commissioner for the Special Areas (England and Wales).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was going into the question and, in due course, would report his proposals to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that he was prepared to arrange a special Meeting of the Cabinet if the Chancellor of the Exchequer required it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an amendment was to be moved in the House of Commons to provide that the present Act should come to an end in May instead of after a year.     He saw no objection to this.The Minister of Health said he had received a disturbing private report as a consequence of certain enquiries that he had made.     He asked that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should bear them in mind in considering this question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to do this.     He also undertook to receive suggestions from any of his colleagues on the subject.- 21 -
The President of the Board of Education said that he had a suggestion to make to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet did not dissent from the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s view that the proposed amendment to terminate the present Act at the end of May instead of after a year should he accepted.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 25th November, 1936.
