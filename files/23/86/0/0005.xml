ITALY.h Re(Previous Reference: Cabinet 03 (36), Conclusion 3. )l. The Secretary of state for Poraign Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to the following Conclusion reached at the   testing referred to in the mar; in:-&apos;That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should, in the li&apos;.ht of the discussion, adopt a policy of improving relations with Italy&quot;,He had not realised at the time that a d:cision of policy was being taken.   Me did not quarrel with a policy of Improving relations with Italy, which in fact was proceeding, and, from the latest tele prams f.om i.ome, appeared to be go ins on well*   He did rather demur, however, to the words &quot;in the light of the discussion&quot;.    There had been several points raised in the discussion which could hardly V met.     &apos;or example, there was little probability that our relations with Italy could reach such a point- as to Justify a lessening of our armaments In the mediterranean, and a recent telegram from i:is Majesty&apos;s Ambassador In Rome showed that there was not li.:ely to be a desistance by Italy from propaganda against us in the East.   He did not ash for a reversal of the decision, :^ut he would be rlad if the Cabinet could take note o:. his remarks.The Cabinet tooi: note of the remarks of the Secretary oi State for Foreign Affairs as s n.j.iarised abov:.
BE PROPOSED FIVE-POWER;(Previous Reference: Cabinet 62 (36), Conclusion 2. )2. The Secretary oi State for Foreign Affairs said that an interim Despatch to the Powers concerned in the Five-Pov.&apos;er Conference had been drawn up by the Foreign Office and circulated to the Cabinet. This only suLiriarised the present position of the negotiations. He now had ready a further document containing his ovm suggestions, together with a covering note, which he hoped to circular3 at once.   He wanted to kiake a coric.iznication to the othe: Powers concerned at the end of the present v.reel:.   He therefore asked fox- a Special Besting of the Cabinet to consider the matter.The Cabinet agreed  To hold a Special meeting on Friday, November 13th, at 10-30 a.m. , at 10 Do ning Street.(NOTE:   Arranrements are being made tu postpone the Meeting of the Air Defence Research Committee which had been arranged for 11 a.m. on Friday, &apos;November. 13th.)
I THE PROPOSED I FIVE-POWER I CONPH ENOE.I German and I Italian Ob-I jections to I a Guarantee I to the United I Kingdom.I Report by I the Chiefs | of StaffII Coinmittee.I (Previous [ Reference: Cabinet 64 (36), Con-|     elusion 2.)3. The OeMhet had before them a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Coumittee (CP.-302 (36)) in connection with the proposed Five-Power Conference replying to a request by the Secretary o,i State for Foreign Affairs that the Conimittee of Imperial Defence should consider the question of the desirability of our receiving guarantees in any new Locarno Treaty froru France against Germany and from Germany against France.    They recalled that in an earlier Report they had advised that, from the military point of viev, we had on balance something definite to gain from receiving such guarantees.    As a result of this new examination in the light of the objections made by Germany and Italy they saw no military reason to modify their previous opinion, but, as they had frequently emphasised, they considered it vitally important at the present juncture to leave no stone unturned to lessen the chances of our being involved in war.    If it was the viev of the Foreign Office that a Five-Power Pact was likely to make a substantial contribution to the cause of peace, they thoupht that any reasonable concession that would facilitate its conclusion ought to be made. From this point of vie&quot;/, therefore, they considered it vrouldbe wiser, if necessary, to forgo the advantage that was to be gained by receiving guarantees from France and Germany.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Foreign Office still maintained their desire for a guarantee from France and Germany.The Cabinet agreed  That the question should be placed on the Agenda Paper for the Meeting on Friday, November 13th.-3-
J&quot;HE SITUATION   IN SPAIN.I(Previous II Reference: I  Cabinet 62m\ elusion 5. )4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drev attention to telegram No. 249 of November 7th to the Chaige d&apos;Affaires at Madrid containing instructions as to the action he was to take if General Franco&apos;s forces succeeded in occupying that city   a matter, however, which appeared still to be in doubt. The German and Italian Gove-nments, he thought, would, in that eventuality, reoognise General Franco&apos;s Government. France was likely to do &apos;.something less than our intention &quot;to establish such dg facto contacts with General Franco&apos;s adi.dnistration as are practically necessary for the protection of British interests&quot;, but without there being any question of recognising that Government as the legal Government of Spain. If there was any more news as to the situation in Spain he would communic   te it at the Meeting arranged for November 13th.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he would be glad of a decision to deal with the question on its merits and not to follow any lead by the French Government, who were tied up by their own internal political situation.The Secret-v.ry of State for Air dre&quot;&apos;. ttr attention of the Cabinet to the desirability of obtaining any advantage we could from recognition of General Franco&apos;s Government at the best possible moru.nt from the point of view of the proposal to establish an ae:od_ome at Gibraltar, which is dealt with in the Conclusion which follows. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed, but again pointed out that General Franco had by no means yet defeated his opponents, and the possibility of a protracted struggle could not be excluded.-4-
3IBRALTAR AS A LINK IN IMPERIAL COMMUNICATIONS .(Previous I Reference: Cabinet 62 (35) , Coii-clus ion 12 .)5. Tne Cabinet had before taein CP. 29*4 (33))covering tne following documents on tne subject ofGibraltar as a Link in Imperial Commu.nicationo : -(i) An Extract from tne draft kinatea of the 2b3rd Meeting of tne Committee of Imperial Defence:(ii) A Memorandum by tne Joint Oversea and Home Defence Sub-Committee of tne &gt; Committee of Imperial Defence)l+ (C.I.D. Paper No. 424-C) :(iii) An Extract from the Minutes of tne 281st Meeting of tne Committee of Lmperial Defence, held on 30tn July, 1936:(iv) A copy of a letter from tne Law Officers of tne Crown to tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CI.D. Paper no. 429-C) :(v) A Memorandum by tne Secretary ofState for Air (C.I.D. Paper No. 428-C) .The draft Conclusions reached by tne Committee ofImperial Defence at their 2b3rd Meeting were asfollows :-{&amp;) That tne provision of an air base at Gibraltar is essential for tne needs of Imperial defence.(b) That tne only practicable site for an aerodrome is tnat of tne proposed reclamation on tne west side of tne British Neutral Ground.( c) To take note that reclamation work on the site proposed will almost certainly cause reactions in Spain, whatever Government may be in power.(d) To take note tnat in tne opinion of tne Lav. Officers we nave a wrima facie case to take whatever initial steps are considered appropriate pending objection by tne Spanish Government .(e) Tnat tne best method of carrying tnrougn tne scheme, wnetner by proceeding at once without any reference to Spain or by waiting to negotiate with wxiatever Spanish Government emerges from tne present Civil rtar, is a question of policy wnicn can only be decided by the Cabinet.(f) To invite tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to circulate to tne Cabinet an Appreciation of the political factors involved in sucn a decision by the Cabinet.(g) To ask tne Secretary to submit tne Committee&apos;s recommendations, together-5-
with the opiidon of the Law Offioers of the Crown and all ot,her relevant Papers, for the consideration of the Cabinet.(h) That no steps towards implementing&quot; the scheme should be taken by the Air Ministry pending the Cabinet decision referred to in (e).The following additional Papers were also before the Cabinet:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-295 (36)), furnished in accordance with (f) above, stating that, in the conditions prevailing in Spain, no moment could be more unfortunate than the present for embarking on the project Of an air base at Gibraltar, and recommending that the initiation ot the scheme be suspended at least until the issue of the civil war became clearer-arid the international situation generally more favourable than at present:a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-306 (36)) circulating the text o: a Secret Despatch from the Governor or Gibraltar oentaining the latter&apos;s views on the proposal.In the discussion that took place on this question there was no difference or opinion from the recommendation of the Committee ot Imperial Defence that the provision of an air base at Gibraltar is essential to the needs of Imperial Defence.   The sole difficulty was the action to be taken and the proper time for taking it.One suggestion was that we should proceed at once to reclaim the land required for the aerodrome, notwithstanding that any Spanish Government was certain to protest and to take us to the Hague Court. The objections raised to this course, as set forth in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, were developed at some length.   Among these   objections were the following;-
(1) That the Spanish people would resent extremely our stealing a march on 1 them: jj(2) That we were &quot;by no means certain of Winning our case before the Hague Court, which would create a situation of great embarrassment:(o) That we might not only lose the case but also lose the de facto jurisdiction which we now exercised over the waters adjoining the neutral zone:(4) That Italy was liable to claim soma corresponding benefit in the Balearic Islands.So far as the need for the aerodrome from the point of viev.- of the defence of the fortress was concerned, it was pointed out that the advantages were to some extent set-off by the disadvantage that even today the North front of Gibraltar was hardly a defensible position against attack from Spain, and that the aerodrome itself would be completely indefensible against attack from that direction. The whole of Spain was still very sensitive about our occupation of Gibraltar, which was treated there as | temporary.   The present struggle ndght well result in   the establishment of a strong Nationalist Government I in Spain, and the risk of Spanish hostility might then be greatly increased by the action we had taken. | A very grave situation would then be created. I The Secretary of State for Air reported to the I Cabinet certain researches a-nd experiments which, I though incomplete, were promising, and which might | enable the occupied neutral te. ritory to be utilised, at any rate in time of war, as an emergency landing | ground, though it would be very inconvenient from; I the point of vie &apos; of the amenities of the Rock. i
Without Eridtiiiiilsing the importance of the provisi on of an aii has- ac Gibraltar for the needs Of Imperial Defence, the Cabinet felt that the risks of alienating Spain and of creating international complications and dii-icul uies by talcing action at tne present time to reclaim the land required for an aerodrome, were of such gravity as to outweigh any advantages to be derived from immediate action.    They therefore agreed  (a) That immediate action to proceed ,;ith the reclamation should be postponed:(b) That the moment was not opportune for any approach to Spain:(c) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Arfairs should keep a watchful eye for any opportunity to deal with the Spanish Government that emerged from the present sti Uggle(d) That the Cabinet should be consulted at every phase before action was taken:(e) That the Secreta y of State for Air should follow up the possibilities he had indicated of an emergency alternative in case the need should arise.
MINISTERS&apos; SALARIES.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 60 (36) Conclusion 6.)6.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the Cabinet had not yet discussed in detail what was to be included in the Bill for Ministers&apos; Salaries and connected (iUestions. He suggested the appointment of a Cabinet Committee. The Cabinet agreed:(a) That a Cabinet Committee shouldbe set up to recommend to the Cabinet the heaus of the Bill dealing with Ministers&apos; Salaries and connected questions.(b) That the Home Secretary shouldbe the Chairman.(c) That the Lord Privy Seal shouldbe a member.(d) That the Home Secretary shouldinvite such other colleagues as he would wish to join the Committee.(Note:    The Home Secretary after consultation with the Prime Minister communicated to the Secretary the following list:-The Home Secretary   (in the Chair)The Lord President of the CouncilThe Chancellor of the ExchequerTne Lord Privy SealThe First Lord of the AdmiraltyThe Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesThe President of the Board of Education,)
MSBOHANT SHIPPING , LEGISLATION.(Previous Reference: Cabiriet 58 (36), Conclusion 9 &amp; Appendix.)7.    The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the President oi the Board of Trade (CP.-303 (36)) seeking authority to proceed at once with the preparation of a Merchant Shipping Bill, to deal in the first place with the overloading of shies and with life-saving appliances on fishing vessels, and possibly with steering gear and the loading of grain oarpoes if legislation on these subjects proved necessary.The President of the Board of Trade made a statement on the lines of his memorandum and mentioned that he wished to deal with this matter before the question of shipping subsidies came before the House of Commons.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the President of the Board of Trade to proceed at once with the preparation of the Merchant Shipping Bill on the lines proposed in his memorandum (CP. 303 (36)) and summarised above.
SUPERANNUATION OF LOCaL GOVERt&apos;iMEilT EMPLOYEES.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 58 (36), Conclusion 9 &amp; Appendix,)J       8.       The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Health (CP.-301 (36)) asking the approval oi his colleagues to the preparation of a Bill to amend the Local Government and Other Officers Superannuation Act, 1922, with the object of making provision for superannuation oompulsory in the case of &quot;officers&quot; as distinguished from &quot;servants&quot; (i.e., broadly speaking, manual workers). After explaining the effect of the principal provisions in the proposed Bill, which had for the most part been discussed with the associations of local authorities and of employees of local authorities in England and Wales, the Minister oi Health oointed out that as the 1922 Act applied to Scotland it would be preferable that any amending Bill should also apply, although he appreciated that the Secretary of State for Scotland might wish to oonsult further with representatives of Scottish local authorities and others concerned before finally determining the scope of any amending legislation as applied to Scotland.After hearing statements from the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Cabinet agreed:(a) To authorise the Minister of Healthto prepare a Bill to amend the Local Government and Other Officers Superannuation Act, 1922, with the object of making provision for superannuation compulsory in the case of &quot;officers&quot; as distinguished from &quot;servants&quot;.(b) That the question of the extension ofthe Bill to Scotland should be considered by the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland after the views of the Scottish local authorities have been obtained.

He warned the Cabinet, however, that if the subject was debated at any length, attention would be drawn to certain features of the Law of Libel which would be subjected to criticism.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Bill should not besupported.(b) That if the subject was discussed,the Attorney-General should deal with it.
