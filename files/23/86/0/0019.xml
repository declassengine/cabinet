THE LATE KING.The Prime Minister&apos;s Services in Abdication Crisis. (Previous Reference: Cabinet 74 (36), Conclusion 2. )1. The Chanceller of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet that for six weeks they had worked under theshadow of possibilities which were a menace to theconstitutional system of Government in the United Kingdomand in the Empire.   Each member ol the Cabinet had madehis own contribution, but on the Prime Minister hadfallen the brunt of the responsibility and the task ofconducting conversations of a difficult and delicatecharacter with the principal figure.    Now that matterswere back to normal and confidence had returned, hefelt that the Cabinet would wish to express theirgratitude and deep appreciation of the tact, courage,patience and understanding that the Prime Minister hadrevealed in a difficult situation(The Chancellor oi the Exchequer&apos;s statement met with general support.)The Prime Minister thanked his colleagues warmly for the generous tribute of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    He himseli only cared for the appreciation of the people whom he valued.    All his friends had been very generous to him in the last few days. The support of the Cabinet had been worth a great deal to him during the last few weeks.    He rather deprecated singling out any member of the Cabinet, but he felt he must mention the help he had received from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the invaluable assistance of the Home Secretary in all kinds of matters. He also expressed a deep debt of gratitude to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs for the great knowledge and ability he had shown In dealing with the Dominions.    During this episode one thing that had helped him very much was his friendship for King Edward VIII. Twelve years ago he had got to know the ex-King well, and they had travelled together in Canada.    From time to time he had tried to help his late Majesty, and he felt sure that this friendship had pioved of great value in the recent crisis- v
THE FIVE-POWER CONFERENCE..Previous Reference: Cabinet 73&amp;36), Conclusion 2.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had nothing to say on the subject of the Five-Power Conference.
TH7] SITUATION IN SPAIN.(Previous Referenee: 0 Cabinet 73 (36), Conclusion 3. )Proposed Mediation and Nonintervention.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that the United States of America had issued a helpful statement on the Anglo-French proposals fo) mediation.    The Soviet Governinent had replied affirmatively to the proposals both for improving the nonintervention arrangements and for mediation. Germany and Italy had not definitely refused to negotiate. Portugal had been the least helpful of all.    In the meanwhile volunteers were still pouring into Spain and it was urgent to take some action to follow up the Anglo-French initiative.   He was considering the matter in consultation with the French.So far as the policy of non-intervention was concerned, the present situation could not be allowed to continue without an effort to put it right, as very large numbers of volunteers were pouiing into Spain and changing the whole aspect of the war.    If General Franco ^had won the war earlier, no gr at difficulties would have arisen, such as the^Majorca venture.    Any plan. L must not be/wpp 6UCt by the parties concerned. The International Committee&apos;s   plan was rather over-elaborate and no answer had yet been received from either of&apos; the contending parties in Spain.The Foreign Office, wiLhout having had time fPrinter-Departmental consultation, had suggested that some international naval action might be adopted, not to supersede the International Committee&apos;s plan, but to supplement it.    Of course this suggestion could only be adopted by international agreement.    The French Government were willing for international control on the Spanish frontier, though Portugal was likely to be more difficult.    &apos;The idea was that the navies of the United Kingdom, France and Italy in the Mediterranean, and of the United Kingdom and Germany on the Atlantic coast-3-
of Spain, should operate internationally in the samemanner as the British ships were operating today; thatis to say, to allow innocent cargoes to go lorward, underescoit if necessary, and to stop ships carrying munitions.In the course of the discussion on this proposalit was pointed out that this scheme would not workwithout the good will oi Germany and Italy.    If thosecountries wished to continue sending arms to Spainthey could easily conceal the weapons under an innocentcargo and escort the ships into port.    The war materialwould only &quot;be revealed by international examination ofevery Ship.    If Germany, Italy and Russia were preparedto woik the Non-intervention Agreement this new arrange-ment would be unnecessary.    If they were not, it wouldbe ineffective.The proposal was also criticised on the ground thatit would be disliked by both of the parties to theSpanish civil war and would render this country unpupularthroughout Spain.An alternative suggestion was that since thevolunteers came almost wholly by land, across thePyrenees, it would be better to concentrate internationalefforts on the land approach. _---&gt;The Home Secretary mentioned that the Spanish civil war was getting troublesome from a domestic point of view.    That very evening, for example, there was to be a rally by the Left Wing Parties outside the German Eiihassy, led by a deputation to the Geiman Ambassador asking that Germany should not continue to help General Franco.In this connection adverse comment was made on the propagandist character of the speech delivered on the pr-vious day by the GerLian Ambassador.The viev/ was expressed that at the moment it would be better to take no action at all.    All action was-4-
fraught with difficulties and dangers, and would involve our carrying the OA in burden.    The faot that so fai the Government had kept this country out of the Spanish war was popular in the country. In these circumstances was it not wiser to wait until there was a stalemate, when Germany, Italy and Russia might themselves be tired of the wai arid seek our good offices9   To abstain from action, it was urged, was important from the point of view of the Italian negotiations, which were going well.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in reply to a question, said that the scheme for international naval action was not likely to be raised that Friday at the International Comiidttee, but the Committee1s own scheme would be raised. He pointed to the undesirability that General Franco should succeed as the result oi German and Italian assistance.The Chancellor of the Exche uer said it was clear that the Cabinet diu not like the idea of a naval blockade in which we should have to play the principal part.    He himself did not mind participating in watching the land frontier.    The only way he could see to stop assistance from overseas was to get Germany, Italy and Russia to agree to stop it.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had been considering whether it would not be wise to use the authority of this country in international affairs, which had been rather enhanced by the recent crisis, to invite the countries ri^ainly concerned   France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Russia   to come to London to discuss the matter as principals.    The weakness of the existing International Committee was that its members had no authority.    He felt, however, that it would-5-
not be luich use to summon a meeting unless we had a plan to put before them.The suggestion was nade that the richt plan to put before them was the plan we ourselves were oarrying out, namely, of ascertaining the character of cargoes in British bottoms, stopping the ships containing munitions of war and allowing innocent oargoes to proceed, under escort in some cases.The Prime Minister thought that the proposed Conference was well woith considering.    It could go to the root of the natter.    If responsible representatives of the countries concerned were to attend we could ascertain if they were willing to co-operate.The Foreign Secretaiy said that his proposal was to invite the representatives of the countries he had mentioned to come to London to discuss the question. He would propose to send a Despatch to each nation setting forth th~ seriousness of the situation. Poauibl.y- ho would prefer to ocnd it after tho invito/ tions had  boon acrgpted.Doubts were expressed as to whether it would be wise to take a decision without further opportunity for deliberation.    It was suggested that the state of affairs in Spain was likely to remain unsettled for a long time.    It was unlikely either that General Franco could conquer Catalonia or that the Spanish Government could recover the territory occupied by General Franco. Conditions were more analogous to South or Central America than to Europe.The Foreign Secretary thought that a convenient time for th  Conference would be about the 11th Ji . jThe Prime Minister and the Chancellor- of the Bxohequer both rather favoured the idea of&apos; a Conference.-6-
The Secretary of State for Air urged that belore deciding; upon a Conference it was necessary for the Cabinet to know what was to be proposed.    Any idea, for example, of suggesting the partition of Spain would only result in the hatred of all parties in Spain being directed towards this country.    The natter was not urgent, as it was bad weather for fighting.The Foreign Secretary said that he would examine this proposal further.
SPAIN.The Ealearic Islands.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 73 r   (36), Conclusion 6. )4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-335 (36)) containing an outline of the steps takento establish Italian leadership in the Ealearic Islands, and drawing attention to the strategical ana political implications in Europe of effective Italian control of the Islands, and the question of the precis:5 nature of the British interests thus placed in jeopardy and the steps whioh should be taken to protect them.    Attached to the Memorandum was a translation of reoent instructions sent by the French Governme. t to their Ambassador at Rome, showing that the French appeared to be fully alive to the dangers of the situation, and the Secretary of State suggested that, in view of the nature of these representations and as a first step, the French Government should be asked to keep the United Kingdom informed of any reply they Liight receive.The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that the Admiralty had considered the desire of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that a second British ship should be stationed in the Baleaiic Islands, but had come to the conclusion that it would be better to maintain there one large ship, such as a Capital Ship, rather than two small oiaes.It was suggested that the occupation of the Balearic Islands by Italy was not likely to occur, in viev of the assurances the Italian Government had given to the contrary.    What appeared more probable was a rising in thr- Islands and the declaration of a republic. If General Franco were successful, the Italians would probably have an understanding with him whereby they would get the use of the Islands in an emergency. If the gpanieh Gove: nment.were to win, the republic would still be declared/and Italy would have an understanding with its Government.-8-
Gibraltar as a Link&apos; in Impe r ia 1 I Communications.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 64 (36), Conclusion 5.)The suggestion was made that if the Italians were,1to take Majorca we ought to take advantage of the situation to get ahead with the Gibraltar aerodrome. We could fairly say to the Spanish Government that if they allowed another nation to acquire a preponderant position in Majorca, which was within bombing range of Gibraltar, we were entitled to make oui own arrangements for an aerodrome at Gibraltar which, as a matter of fact, we maintained were within our rights.The possibility was mentioned of obtaining a set-off to an Italian occupation of Majorca, but it was admitted that such a possibility would hardly be opened up if Majorca, became nominally a republic.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that before taking any action in regard to Majorca he wanted to know how seriously an Italian occupation of the Island would be regarded from a strategical point of view.   He would therefore like to have the matter- considered by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. The Cabinet agreed  That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should be asked to consider, from a strategical point of view, the consequences of either-(i) an Italian occupation of Majorca, or(ii) an arrangement between the ItalianGovernment and the Spanish Government, or with the Government of a Republic in Majorca, under which, in time of emergency, the Italians could make use of the facilities of this Island, in particular, or of the Balearic Islands generally.-9-
I RELATIONS I WITH THE f IRISH FR^E [ STATE.Reference: Cabinet 62 (36), Con* j   elusion 16. )5. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pave the Cabinet some details ol legislation passed by the Irish Free State Dail in connection with the late King&apos;s abdication.    For some time past Mr De Valera had been proposing to introduce legislation which would have the effect of divorcing the Crown from any connection with the internal affairs of the country, while admitting it to some extent in external affairs. Mr Ds&apos; Valera had proiidsea. that both the United Kingaoiu and the Dominions should receive some forecast of the legislation before it was introduced.   When the recent crisis aiofls over the abdication o: King Edward VIII Mr De Valera had been helpful to the extent that he had done his utmost to pass his legislation simultaneously with oui own legislation, although he had not found it possible to oouiplete it until Saturday, December 12th. Mr De Valera, however, had .seized the opportunity of the crisis to rush through legislation founded on the Constitutional bases proposed     for   his major legislation.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs then gave the Cabinet an account of the legislation passed in the Irish Free State, and promised to circulate a Memorandum giving particulars.    It had not been possible to circulate this Memorandum before the present Meeting for the reason that copies were only received on Monday last.as suon as the Irish Free State legislation had been received, the Irish Situation Committee had met. They had much regretted the nature of the legislation, but saw no chance of getting it altered.    They felt that more important than the abolition of the Crown in internal affairs was its retention in matters of. external relationships.    The Coiuiiiittee had formed the-10-
impression that Mr De Valera meant to he in a positionwhere he could face the world as a iueh.ber of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations with the Crown as itssymbol.    They had felt that there might be advantagesin our admitting that the latter was an acceptablescheme, and in trying to get it acknowledged in dueform. He suggested, therefore  (i) An informal approach to Mr De Valera, to whom it would be pointed out that his legislation was a matter of concern to all members of the Conmonwealth. It would be suggested to him that he should send particulars to all the Dominions.(ii) That we should say that, lor our part, we wanted information on vaiious points, including, in particular, whether the second Bill covered all functions in connection with external aflairs and whether the Irish Free State under the Bill would remain a full member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or would revert to the position of an associate member.(iii) That we should keep &quot;in touch with the other Dominions on the subject.The Irish Situation Committee, the Secretary of Stateadded, had contemplated that if the answers fromMr De Valera were not too unsatisfactory it might bepossible to work up to a new declaration setting forththe position of the Crown in regard to the Dominions.The Minister oi Labour pointed out the importance of whether the Irish Free State remained free to send people to this country.    At present people came from the Irish Free State, obtained work without much difficulty, then went on th- dole and were replaced by other Irish folk who did the same thing.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that we had the light to exclude them, arid that such a right was already exercised in Canada and other Dominions.   He thought that the Bills passed by the Irish Free State did not cairy out the whole of Mr De Valera&apos;s plans, but were only an instalment.-11-
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for Doiidnion Affairs should circulate a Memorandum to the Cabinet giving particulars of the Irish Free State legislation:(b) That he should arranne for the Bills to be sent to the Dominions (whether by Mr De Valera 01 by himself):(c) That he should invite the comments of the DominionsJ(d) That the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, should take steps to ascertain the views of the Prime Minister of Northern lie land:(e) That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should ask such questions as he nJ-pht deem desirable of Mr De Valera:(f) That he should abstain from any comment addressed to Mr De Valera until the Cabinet had had a further opportunity of considering the matter:(g) That after the Recess, with the above further material before them, the Cabinet should again consider the question.
THE ROLE OF THE BRITISTTaRMY.^PreviousReferenoe: Cabinet 73 (36), Conclusion 8. )6.  In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had before them the following Memoranda on the subject of the Role of the British Army:-A Memorandum   by the Secretary of State for War (CP.-326 (36)), in whioh he set forth his reasons for . asking his colleagues to reaffirm their decision with regard to the role of the Army as it appeared in the &quot;Statement relating to Defence&quot; (Cnd.5107), viz.:-&quot;The a liny has three nain functions to perform.    It has to maintain garrisons overseas in various parts of the Empire, to provide the military share in Home Defence, including Anti-Aircraft Defence, Coast Defence and Internal Security, and lastly, in time of emergency or war, to provide a properly equipped force ready to proceed overseas wherever&apos; it nay be wanted&quot;,ard, in accordance with that decision, to authorise the re-equipment of the Territorial Army as and when opportunity oocuired, priority being given, of course, to the needs of the Regular Army:A further Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (CP.-325 (36)), con-&gt; taining a summary of the present position as regards the organisation, armament and equipment of&apos; the Army in relation to its readiness for war, and a forecast of the stages by which it was hoped to reorganise and re equip it on modern lines:A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-334 (36)) commenting on CP.-326 (36)) and advancing considerations which should be taken into account before a final decision is reached on the relative sizes of the three arms of the Fighting Services:a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (CP.-337 (36)) containing his rejoinder to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.- 13 -
The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the lack of a decision on the Territorial Army was holding up the equipment not only of the Territorial Army but also of the Regular Army.     In addition, it was causing uneasiness in the Territorial Army. For these reasons, an early decision was most important.The Chancellor of the .Exchequer recalled the following recommendation of the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements:-&quot;To reserve the decision as to whether or when the proposals for reconditioning the Territorial Force can be implemented for three years, or until such time as the industrial situation of the country and its capacity for output brings these proposals within the range of actual possibilities - by which time other factors in the decision may have become clearer.&quot; (CP. 26 (36))He attached importance to the words &quot;whether or when&quot;which show that no decision of principle had been as to arrangingtaken  / the Territorial Force on the same scale as the Regular Army.     The fact that the successive Chiefs of Staff and Secretaries of State for War had taken the viev/ that, in the event of an attack by Germany on France, we should be prepared to send a land force to Belgium or France (CP. 337 (36) paragraph 6) did not weigh very much with him as the War Office was the interested Department.     He himself raised a much larger question of whether by equipping12 Divisions in the Territorial Force as well asRegular5 Divisions of the/Army, we should be making the best possible use of our resources.     He did not think the question had ever been examined from that point of view by the Chiefs of Staff together.     He quoted a recent paper by the Minister of Labour to show how heavy were the demands on labour from the present Programme and how difficult the outlook.     He suggested it was- 14 -
madness to add to   oj?   commitments &quot;by trying to equip the Territorial Army on the same scale as the Regulars,     He urged that the Government should consiaer afresh the policy of sending the Territorial Army ab; oad and the possible alternative of utilising the Air Force, even if it involved an increase. Our aim should be to deter war and this might be better accomplished by increasing the Air Force than by equipping the Territorial Army.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence said that he haa been giving continuous attention to this problem.     Twelve months ago, the Cabinet had approve&quot;! the rearmament of the 5 regular Divisions. As explained by the Chancellor of the Exchequer the rearmament of the Territorial Army had been reserved. The Territorial Army, however, was the second line of strength and as such was a constituent part of our land forces.     He recalled the decision already quoted that the reconditioning of the Territorial Force had been reserved &quot;for three years, or until such time as the industrial situation of the country and its capacity for output brings these proposals within the range of actual possibilities.&quot;     The conditions under which the Territorial Army serve included an announcement that if they went abroad they would go in their own formations. Without some new announcement,  they could not be used as mere drafts to the Regular Army.     At present, the Territorial Force was not equipped for going abroad. That fact affected both recruiting and the maintenance of strength.     At the moment, the Territorial Army was not in a fit state to reinforce the Regular Army. If the Territorials were to be re-equipped within the next three years, the plans must be made now. To- 15 -
await the completion of the Regular Army before taking a decision would prove extravagant and costly as firms did not know how to plan out their future without some assurances.     Orders at present were being given from hand to mouth.     In the case of labour,  for example, this consideration was an important one, Messrs. Vickers Armstrong, for example, were engaging apprentices for five years and were prepared to take on further men if the Programme justified this. It was necessary,  therefore, to lay our plans sufficiently far ahead to justify the various firms in taking on nev labour.     In the case of guns and especially gun mountings, the planning had to be done a long way in advance.     The Secretary of State for War, as he understood the matter, was not asking for a decision that 5 Divisions should be sent to the Continent on the outbreak of war or that they should be reinforced at intervals by Territorial Divisions, but only that both the Regulars and the Territorials should be equipped to fulfil this role if and when the Government should so decide.     If no start was made with re-equipping the Territorial Army before the Regular Army was finished, there would be no equipment before 1941.   The Director-General of Munitions Production in the War Office had shown him a Programme, but he  could not really get ahead with it until he really knew whether he had to provide for the equipment of only 5 Divisions or of the Territorial Divisions as well.     That was why the Minister was asking for a decision as to whether the Territorial Army was to be equipped.The Chancellor of the Exchequer appreciated that it was necessary to give directions to the firms as to the provision to be made, but it was necessary- 16 -
first to know what kind of equipment was required. So far as the Territorial Army was concerned, no decisions had ever besn taken on this point.     If, for example, the Territorials v/ere to he armed on the same scale as the Regulars owing to the increasing estimates of cost for the latter, the expenditure would he of the order of  135,000,000 instead of  45,000,000 estimated by the original Defence Requirements Committee.In the course of the discussion,  one   suggestion was that instead of relying on the Territorial Forces to reinforce the Regular Army, if sent to the Continent, the War Office should bring home Regular   oi&apos;ce   from abroad, replacing them with Territorials,     This would not involve so high a scale of equipment for the Territorial Force. Another suggestion was that, owing to the lack of reserves for drafting purposes, it would be necessary, if that plan were adopted, to utilise the whole of the Regular Forces as drafts.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence said that the present idea for arming the Territorial Force was not to re-equip one Division at a time, but to spread new equipment evenly throughout the Force. If it was necessary to send Territorial Divisions abroad, the equipment would be redistributed so as to arm the number of Divisions for which the aggregate available armaments suffice.     He was disturbed at the suggestion that the Territorial Army might not be equipped on the same scale as the Regular Army. He reiterated that what he wished to know was whether it was to be assumed that the equipment was to be provided for 5 Regular Divisions and nothing more.     All sorts  - 17 -
of orders wert held up for lack of a decision on this point.     In the case of the Bren gun, for example, a decision was required as to whether it was to he produced for the Territorial as well as for the Regular Army. In   this   event, the British SmallArms Company should he given an order now in order that they might get ready their jigs and gapoges. The same principle applied to filling factories, explosive factories, cordite factories, etc.The Secretary of State for War said that if the Territorial Force was not to he re-equipped, it might as well be abolished.The First Commissioner of Works pointed out that the whole of the Army abroad only amounted to about 5 Divisions.     If it was to be replaced by the Territorial Force on the outbreak of war, the lattermight as well be reduced to 5 Divisions.     At present,regularthere were only enough men to send about 2/Divisions abroad at the outset of a war.     He recalled the conditions at the outset of the last war when no arms had been available - even for Regular Forces &gt; in some cases.     Troops would be required for the control of the civil population in the next war and the Territorial Force   would be required for this purpose.     At present, they only had a peace establishment of 50 per cent of the war establishment. Although it might be doubtful whether 17 Divisions could be sent in eight months, some armaments ought to be obtained to start the training of the Territorials - unless it was proposed to tell the French that under no conditions would we send an army to support them beyond the Regulars.- 18 -
Though the effect of    Air Forces was very great, they had not yet proved capable of bringing a war to an end -not even in China and Abyssinia, where the conditions had been very favourable.     Consequently, Air Forces alone would not be regarded on the Continent as a sufficient deterrent to war.     Therefore, he thought there should be some plan of rearmament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was not approaching the matter from a financial point of view. The doubt he felt was as to whether we were right in approaching any war from the point of view of the last war.     To think that we could send an Expeditionary Force at the outset of a war might involve a rude awakening. He had not said that he was unwilling to equip the Territorial Army.     The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence had been talking from the point of view of supply, but he had another function to oversee strategy. He himself doubted whether we were right in equipping the Territorial Force for the trenches.     He thought the question had not been considered impartially.     It was always assumed that w.e must make a contribution to a land war. As one of his colleagues said,  the French might not be satisfied, but it wae not for France to dictate to us the distribution of our Forces.     He did not want to say that no army should go to the Continent, but he had tried to make a prima facie case to show that the idea of sending 5 Regular Divisions to France at the outset of War and 12 Divisions later required re-examination.The Secretary of State for War felt confident that the Chiefs of Staff had examined this question again and again and were not likely to change their views.- 19 -
The suggestion was made that there was not enough skilled labour in the country to justify starting on a new Programme for the Territorial Army.     On the other hand, it was pointed out that the industrialists could not say whether they could carry out such a Programme until they knew details.The Home Secretary said that every one accepted the proposition that the Cabinet were not deciding now how the Territorial Army should or should not be used - on the Continent or otherwise. He thought the point made by the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence was that if we refuse to arm the Territorial Army now we were deciding how it should not be used.
