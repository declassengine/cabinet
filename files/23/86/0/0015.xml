IITHE KING&apos;S |IINTENTION 11TO MARRY. I*THE PRIME MINISTER said that the present Meeting was one of the greatest importanoe.    On the previous evening he had seen the King.    He had oonfirmed that there was no truth in Mr Winston Churohill&apos;s suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s health was seriously impaired. The King had heen annoyed at what Mr Ohurohill had said.    The Prime Minister himself had never known the King more oool, oleai-minded, understanding every point and arguing the different issues better.    Nd man oould have done this better.The King, said the Prime Minister, had sent for him on the previous day and said he was prepared to sign his abdication, whioh would enable the neoessary legislation to be got through the House of Commons onTuesd&apos;iy, hut  ..... There was a &quot;but&quot;.    It arosein a oase whioh the Prime Minister thought oould be got through the House of Commons.    In putting that oase he would propose to begin by saying that this was no Constitutional struggle between the King and the Prime Minister, or the King and his Ministers.    There was nothinp of the kind.    It was a struggle in a human heart, a struggle in whioh be himself was trying* to find a solution.   He would then propose to place tihlo story of his relations with the King in this matter. He would tell how the King had always insisted on his intention to marry Mrs Simpson and had said that in order to oarry this out he would go.    On this he had never wavered for an instant.The Prime Minister said that the King believed that his own honour was involved in this marriage and that nothing would turn him from it.    At the same time His Majesty&apos;s wish was to avoid dividing the country into two parts.    He hated the suggestions that were being made in the Press of divisions in the country and in the Empire.    He would go of his own tree will.-1-
The Prime Minister himself had explained to the Kinp that it was a point of honour in the interests of the mtion and the Empire to take his decision soon. But what had troubled the Primp Minister himself was as to the next five months.    Supposing the Kinp renounoed the Throne, a King who had ahdioated oould not live in his own oountry, and theie seemed no alternative hut for His Majesty to drift about Europe. At the present moment even, he did not oare to be in London and would probably stay at Fort Belvedere until the whole matter waa settled.   What troubled him, therefore, was that if the divoroe deoree was not made absolute he would have abandoned the Throne and night well be unable to marry   a very terrible position.    Only on the previous day a solution to this problem hnd been suggested.    It had appeared to him a possible way out, and he hoped that on exaiaination it might be possible to aocept it.    It was the only solution that he himself &lt;s&gt; uld see, or for which it might be possible for him to be responsible. He asked the Home Seoretary to explain the suggestion.SIR JOHN SIMON said that in Englanu, th:&gt;uph not in Scotland, when a divoroe was granted by the Courts a deoree nisi was deolared, with an interval, whioh was normally one of six months, before the decree was made absolute.    In Sootland there was no suoh interval, nor ir/some other parts of the Empire:    for example, British Columbia.    This showed that there was nothing sacrosanct In the English piocedure.    Eveu in England the interval was some timed abridged, and it was in th* disoretion of the Courts to grant an abridgement. The usual reason for   hioh an abridgement was allowed was in order to seoure the legitimacy of a ohild. That particular methou was not applicable to the present oase.    It was true that the President of the Divorce Court imipht conceivably be willing to
oonsider it, but the probability was the other way, more espeoially beoause it might throw doubt on the disinterestedness of our legal system.    Though this partioular method of abridgement was not applioable to the present oase, the same result might be achieved by legislation:   that is to say, the legislation might provide that in the oase of Simpson v. Simpson the deoree should be deolared to have the effeot of beooming absolute from the date of the passing of the Aot.    The Bill might be passed at the same time as the Abdication Bill.   Whereas the latter would have to reoeive the assent of the Dominion Parliaments, the legislation making the deoree absolute would apply only to the Westminster Parliament.The Prime Minister said that the King was making a tremendous saarilioe in the interests of the oountry. Ever Sj.noe he had beoome Prinoe of Wales he had been doing his duty to the people with great assiduity, and he thought he was entitled to ask that the people should free him in the present oase.Mr CHAMBERLAIN asked whether the King&quot; s abdioation woulu be oonditional on the Bill being passed through, or would it take plaoe in either event?SIR THOMAS IMSKIP asked if the new proposal was to form part o&lt;ff the Statement made to Parliament?THE PRIME MINISTER said the present idea was to announce the whole soheme at once.    He would propose to oonolude his own speeoh by a statement that the King hoped that Parliament would give him this assistanoe.Mr OHAMBERLaIN understood, then, that the Prime Minister was to announce that the King had determined to abdicate and hoped that his people would help him in this matter.    It was important that it should not be put in suoh a way that the seoond part was to be done as a bargain in return for the first.-3-
SIR JOHN SIMON understood the proposal to bs that the King would send a Message to the effeot thnt he had deternilned to marry this lady and hoped that he might be able to marry soon, and that the Prime Minister would say that the King&apos;s abdication was unoonditioijal arod that this was what the Prime Minister thoueht was right.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD pointed out that the proposal would be a great shook to Churoh and Nonconformist opinion.Mr CHAMBERLAIN agreed.SIR JOHN SIMON said he had in mind thnt there would be no publio statement until after the King&apos;s Message had been announoed in Parliament by the Prime Minister on Tuesday.    On Monday he contemplated only a statement that an announcement would be made on Tuesday. The King&apos;s Message would then oome first.THE PRIME MINISTER said that another day for making the necessar.v preparations would be worth a good deal.Mr CHAMBERLaIN said that after dining out last night he had oome baok and discussed this matter with one or two colleagues and he had heard the proposal for the first time.   He had b^en a good deal shooked and had taken a long time to bring himself to oonsider it. He and Sir John Simon had raoked their brains for hours to try and find some way of avoiding giving a concession to the King that was not available to any othej person. In the result they had oome to the oonolusion that this was the only way.    They had thought of all sorts of other plans, suoh as hastening on the A.P.Herbert Divorce Bill.    No other method, however, gave any degree of oeitainty to the King, and they had always had to coxiie back to this.    One thing that Made the proposal very difficult to swallow was the idea of a bargain   the underlying assumption that if the King
would abdioate, Pailiament would enable him to marry the lady in question.    It would be essential for it to be put in suoh a way that it oould not be represented as a bargain.   What he himself had in mind was that, after the Royal Message oontainlng the Instrument of Abdioation had been signed and witnessed by theKing&apos;s brothers on Tuesda;, morning, and presented tothe Prime Minister Parliament, it would be open to J^im to pioture to theHouse of Commons the very difficult position of theKing;   the saorifioes that His Majesty had made ingiving up the Throne now for the reason that neitherthe nation, the Empire, nor the world oould allow thepresent oonditions to continue.    The Prime Ministerooula add that in this exoeptional position Ministerswere anxious to give consideration as to how to overoomethe diffioulty.    In reply to a request as to whatwould be the answer to the question why the Kinr shouldbe treated in a manner different from that ol anordinary oitizen similarlysituated, he said that theanswer was that the oountr;y oould not afford to wait.THE PRIMS MINISTER pointed out the distinction between the King and a private individual in this matter. The eyes of the whole world would, be fooussed upon him until a marriage took plaoe.    This would tend to degrade kingship itself.SIR JOHN SIMON added that it oould be said tnat the King would have waited, like an ordinary individual, but for the faot that by doing so the whole oountry and the Empire would be kept in a ferment.It was then suggested that the oomment would be made that onoe the King had abdioated he was in the position of an ordinary oitizen.Mi&apos; OHAMBERLaIN said that they had anxiously oonsiaer-ed that point.    But was it oonceivable that the King ooula wait?-5-
The oiitioisni was then made that the whole affair would be represented as a barpain, as the result of whioh the Government would be promoting something that was altogether repugnant to religious people. The Archbishops, Bishops, and the leaders of Nonconformity would all oppose.Mr RUNCTMAN said h&quot; had no doubt it would oome as a great shock to Nonconi ormist opinion.    On the previous day he had thought it right to talk to some of the Nonconformist leaders.    One of them had expressed satisfaction at the soruples of th^ King- about living with the lady whom he wished to marry, before marriage was possible;   he had been glad to see these signs of a soruple.    He thought that that particulai leader might be inolined to go some way to tide over the difficulty and to draw a distinction in vital matter   between the King and ordinary people.    But the latter was the point on whioh questions would be pressed.SIR SAMUEL HOaRE said the answer to the question was that th^ situation could not be allowed to drift on. He would on no aocount make a bargain, but woula prefer a broad human appeal.    He would say that the King- was making the greatest sacrifice that was possible for him. Was he to risk losing everything by doing- so?   He hiiiiself held rigid views on the question of dlvoroe, but he was not very much moved by the question of whether the decree should be made absolute now or in April.    It was really a question of what the alternatives were.SIR THOMAS INSKIP agreed that whether two months or six months was to be allowed In order to make the deoree absolute was not an essential issue from the point of view of virtue or morals;   but it pave the impression that the Government was throwing a oloak over a oollusive-6-
arrangement.    There might he a sharp division of opinion in the natter, though possibly it might be temporary.    He himself was still suffering from the shook of hearing this proposal.    He oould not forget that we should not be hearing the last of this matter so far as divoroe legislation was oonoerned.    It would be a blow to the sanotity of marriage.LORD HALIFAX spoko with hesitation.    He was impressed by the argument that this would be represented as a oondonation of a oollusion, whioh was a real difficulty.   At first sight he was inolined to expeot that a rigid view would be taken about law and marriage by religious people, but he did not feel insuperable difficulties, for the reasons given by Sir Samuel Hoare.   At the same time it was an unpleasant business whioh left a bad taste.    He had little doubt that there would be a large minority against the Bill in the House or Lords.   He did not see muoh distinction between the new proposal and the old Private Divorce Bills.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.Mr CHAMBERLAIN asked if the matter oould be so arranged that the Bill would not settle the question of whether the divorce oould be opposed, but that it should merely shorten the time within whioh an affidavit oould be lodged.    It was largely a matter of presentation.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the position was not that as sddn as six months had elapsed the parties to divoroe proceedings autonatioally became divoroed* the Divorce Oourt Judge, on the application of the petitioner, declared the deoree absolute. It would be possible to presoribe by the Bill that the term should be X months.-7-
THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL pointed out that affidavits mipht be lodged on the very last day.SIR JOH&apos;i SIMON said that he had considered the matter very oarefully.    Suppose, for example, the King were a private person, let us say a prominent Civil Servant, who would have to give up his job in the event of a divoroe.    Suoh a person would go on with his work and not raise the question of his marriage until he was free.    The King was not in a position to lie low until he was free;   consequently, if he was determined to marry he had to leave now.    That, in his mind, was an argument for the proposal.SIR THOMAS INSKIP did not agree.    If a prominent Civil Servant was publioly kn /wn to be engaged in an affair of this kind (like Mr Parnell, for example), he would have to go.(The Lord President of the Counoil entered at this polntT&quot;)THE PRIME MINISTER apologised to Mr Ramsay MaoDonald, explaining that in sending the summonses to the Meeting at a late hour on the previous night the invitation to the Lord President had been overlooked.He then gave a brief explanation of the position lor the benefit of the Lord President.    The King had deoided to abdicate.   What had worried the Prime Minister himself was the prospeot of the King, after abdication, having to rove about for several months, all the time with the limelight of the world fixed upon him arid with a possibility of the deoree not being oonfirmed, - which woulu be a desperately difficult situation.    The King felt strongly that his subjects, in return for his saorifice and for the heavy duty he had rendered as Prlnoe of Wales, might make it possible for him to assure his marriage, arid the only possible way was a special Bill.-8-
SIR JOHN SIMON explained that the idea was a Bill to provide that the deoree nisi might he made absolute on the passing of the Bill, whioh would cut out the period before the deoree was made absolute, whioh as a matter of faot did not exist in Sootland.The disoussion then oontinued.    It was urged that people would represent the whole thing as huubug and as showing that the Government had wanted to foroe the King to ahdioate.    It would be said that as long as they thought they oould not aohieve this they had taken a high moral line, but as soon as they saw a possibility of foroing the King to relinquish the Throne they had been willing to give him a privilege open to no other man.    The publio woulu ask why, if the King oould keep away from the lady right up to the present time, he oould not wait a few months longer. Moreover, if the Bill was passed it would make it very difiioult for Parliament to rejeot a Private Member&apos;s Bill to abolish the Deoree Nisi and the subsequent period before the divoroe was made absolute.It was pointed out that there were two dangers to the King:- first, the ooll^sive nature of the suit, and, seoond, the possibility of an affidavit. It was thought that the King must fully realise these risks.    Mr Monokton must have suggested them to His Majesty.    If the Government were pressed, therefore, they would have to admit that the plan under consideration had been in the King&apos;s mind.The question was then raised as to what would happen if the King were told that the Cabinet oould not agree to this.THE PRIME MINISTER said he hnd no idea what the King would sa.y to that.-9-
The suggestion was mads that it oould he rapressnted not as a promise or a oondition, but as a hope that Parliement would grant this oonoession.THE PRIME MINISTER said h* had told the King that he would do the best he oould with the Cabinet on this proposal beoause it was the only way he oould see of getting a settlement quiokly.In further disoussion It was urged that the Bill, if introduoed, would weaken the Government and shake its moral   &quot;badly.    It was unlikely that the Labour Party would support the proposal.THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that on the supposition that the proceedings went on in the normal manner, six months would elapse beioie the deoree oould be made absolute.    During this period objeotors would have the right to put in an affidavit on the ground of (l) previous adultery by the petitioner, and (2) oollu-sion.    The Court would have to oonsider the iirst point first.    It would involve an allegation oi adultery by the King.    Collusion oould not be made out if Mr Simpson were to marry the woman named as oo-respond-ent.    It oould not be put to the Court without involving the King.    It would be impossible to face a wrangle in the Courts over the King&apos;s position.   It* any event if the King abdicated this would be an impossible position.The Cabinet were reminded that this issue had been brought up at the previous Meeting, but it had been suggested at the Cabinet that in spite of the King&apos;s position the natter oould be raised.SIR THOMAS INSKIP pointed out that if the King abdicated he would no longer be King.SIR SAMUEL HOARE asked if a private citizen oould be called into Court fox acts done when he had been King0-10-
In further disoussion it was pointed out that by the proposed Bill the Government would In faot be admitting that the divoroe might not beoorue valid aooording to the ordinary law, but was/^validated by the Bill.    This was a terrible pill for the Government to swallow, and there was no knowing what the result might be.The question was raised as to what would be the attitude of the Dominions.Mr MALCOLM MACDOHALD pointed out that the Dominio; s were not affeoted by the passing of the law.It was pointed out, however, that the moral effeot would be very serious.Mr MALCOLM MAODONALD thought that offioial efforts would probably be made in the Dominions to cheok muoh publio comment, though this oould not be relied on entirely.    The Bill would strike Dominion opinion muoh as it would publio opinion here, but the Dominions would realise that they were not a party to the Bill.It was urged against this that the moral position of this oountry in the Dominions was very important, It would be said that the Government had turned away from their moral position.    There would also be very grave differences of opinion in this oountry.    It was suggested, however, that this would not affect the attitude of the Dominions so muoh towards the Monarchy as towards the Government.Referenoe was then made to the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion to present the human aspeot of the question. This oaused some mis giving.    It was suggested that if the Bill were defended on that ground the Government would be in trouble.-11-
The possibility was then oonsidered of justifying the Bill on the highest grounds of State, and the suggestion was made that the reaotions to the proposal should be obtained from those to whom the oountry looked for watohing over the morals of the nation, suoh as the Arohbishop of Canterbury and the leaders of the Nonooni ornist Churohes.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he ptoposed to see the Arohbishop of Canterbury and, if this proposal was approved, the leaders of the Opposition.(The Prime Minister left at this moment to see Queen Mary.)-12-
During the Prime Minister&apos;8 absence, the Ministers discussed the possible reasons of State which might be attempted for a justification of the proposed Bill*One suggestion was that so far as the Ring himself was concerned, the reason why he had to take his decision now was tfce ground of State, namely, because His Majesty realised that he could not keep the whole Umpire and country waiting any longer, and secondly to prepare the way for his successor.This was supported by the suggestion that a decision now would get rid of the present standstill of the machinery of the Government.     There were many things which could not go on so long as the King felt obliged to keep in the background.The seoond suggestion was that It oould be represented that the King had abdicated and there had been no bargain;i that no King who had abdicated could remain in this country;   he must be provided with a home and this involved provision for a wife.It was urged again, however, that the Oovernment would be gravely shaken by this Bill unless stronger reasons oould be urged.     The Oovernment would be criticised on the ground that they had done this to push the King out and owing to their abandonment of their moral position.     It was pointed out also that the King himself if he had been present at the discussion could not fail to see thut If this Bill were passed, the King would be in a worse position so fur us the divoroe was concerned.     The Government also would have got themselves into a position which they could not defend. Could not this be brought to the notice of the King? The King was always very strong for the empire. This
country was not only the legal and constitutional centre of the Empire hut its authority depended even more on the fact that it was a moral centre.     It was only for this latter reason that we could carry the Statute of Westminster.     It was suggested that it would be far better for the King from every point of view to abdicate and take his chance.It was further urged that even if the proposal were considered by some to be in the interests of the country, the Government could never reoover. They would be stepping down from a moral standard that was recognised all over the Empire.     To some members the new proposal seemed even more objectionable than the proposal of a morganatic marriage, which the Cabinet had already rejected.     The weakening of the Government would be very serious in the present international situation when the Government&apos;s authority ought to be strong.     It was suggested that the Foreign Secretary was already pxobably feeling hie position weakening.     He oould not tell what was going on abroad under cover of this crisis.     Could not these unfortunate and dangerous consequences be put to the King who might then consider whether he ehould not leave at once and take hie chance?     Instead of roaming about the continent, oould not the King&apos;s friends arrange for a voyage around the world to fill the interval? In any event, the Government ought to hold to their moral position.In the course of the discussion, attention was drawn to the inability of the Prime Minister to say whether, if the King was refused this legislation, he would go on with his abdication.     That supported the idea -that the Bill was in the nature of a bargain. It was pointed out that the King&apos;s own position would be very difficult if the present deadlock continued.- 14 -
While waiting the termination of the period before the deoree could become absolute, those who were strongest In their wish to keep the King on the Throne might for this very reason take steps to arrange for someone to intervene in the divorce, so as to prevent the decree being made absolute and so keep the King on the Throne for the reason that he could not then marry.     If there were no divorce, was it possible for the King to live without the lady on whom his affections were fixed? If he lived with her without marriage, was it possible for him to remain as King?     Would publio opinion stand the continuance of the present position, it was askedt? The business of the Government;   employment in connection with the Coronation;    financial and business transactions of all kinds were being held up.During this part of the discussion, MR. CHAMBKRLAIN produced a draft statement which he and some of his colleagues had prepared on the previous day on the assumption that the King would not have made up his mind.(After the Prime Minister&apos;s return) MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that the trend of the conversation in the Prime Minister&apos;s absence had been rather strongly against the proposed Bill. It was felt that however the matter was put, it could not be concealed that it was in the nature of a bargain.     Also, it would be a condonation of the proceedings that would not be condoned in other circumstances.     Consequently, there would be a moral weakening of the country In the Empire and in the world.     For those reasons the feeling had- 16 -
prevailed that the Bill could not be introduced and Ministers had constantly been considering the position on that assumption.     In particular, Ministers had examined whether it wae possible that the present conditions oould continue.and grave doubts h*vo been expressed as to whether this was possible in view of the circumstances of the day, the otrong public opinion and the interruptions to public and private business. The King&apos;s own position had also been examined and it was thought that those who were urgently pressing that His Majesty must remain King might take steps to interfere with the completion of the divorce. From that position, Ministers had advanoed to considering the declaration that had been prepared on the previous evening*     In this connection, he read a new passage In the draft Declaration which, he tnought, would be an improvement.     (This appears at the end of the last paragraph of the Appendix.)borne discussion too , place at this point as to the possible publication of the communications to the Dominions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on the previous day he had taken with him Mr. Chamberlain*s draft (without the amendment .Just referred to), but the King had been so hopeful about the proposed new Bill that he had not given very much attention to it in detail.THE PRIME MINISTER said he would get in touch with Mr. Monckton and tell him that Ministers were opposed to the proposed Bill.(It was found that Mr. Monckton, who had been with the Prime Minister Just before the meeting, was still at 10 Downing Street and, on the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion, he was introduced.)
THE PRIME MINISTER explained the position to Mr. Monokton to whom a number of questions were addressed.     Mr. Monokton thought that, in the olrcumBtances, the Kin* might well wish to get in touch with some of hie friends, Including Mr. Winston Churchill.     He thought that the refusal of the Bill would materially alter the position.MR. CHAMBERLAIN told Mr. Monokton that the first effect of the proposed Bill to almost all those present had been one of great shook. Subsequently, they had tried to accommodate themselves to the idea. Nevertheless, no one felt that the reasons for the proposed Bill oould be Justified.     The two main reasons were first, that the Bill oould be represented as being in the nature of a bargain - the King&apos;s abdication being conditional on the promise of the Act. Second, the Government had stood on strong moral grounds throughout these proceedings and that the position in tliie respeot was strong.     Once they had condoned something that was not based on moral grounds, they would never be able to recover that position. Even if on the crest of a wave, so to speak, they could carry the Bill.    Ofnen people came to think It over, the Oovernment would be in the position wfciefa -*o*jhLa he of having to defend something condemned on moral grounds by the country.     Thirdly, the effect on the Monarchy Itself had to be considered of legislation passed to proteot a King from a position to which his subjects were liable.LORD HALIFAX added that Ministers had not been able to overlook the effect of such a Bill on the marriage laws of the country.MR. MONOKTON in reply to a question thought that the King&apos;s reaction to the proposal must be a
demand for more time.     Hie Majesty would find hiswishes Oiposed by Ministers and might well want to seekadvice in other quarters.     Possibly, he might wish toconsult a good many people.     He was not well placedat Fort Belvedere to judge public opinion.THE PRIMS MINISTER hoped that if the Kingfound this necessary, he would not seek the opiniononly of those who were known to hold a particular view*for example, if he wanted to ascertain the views of thsPress he should consult a man like Lord Camrose aswell as Mr. Harmsworth er Lord Beaverbrook.     He saidthat Ministers were impressed by the dangers of delayto the whole country and the Empire.     He was anxiousthat before the Cabinet met at 6.30 p.m., ths Kingshould know how things had gone that morning. He,himself, wae aware that the King realised the publicdesire that the matter should not be allowed to drtiftand that the last thing His Majesty would want wasthe formation of a &apos;&apos;King&apos;s Party*, demons t rut ions ofcheering popularity/and so forth.Ministers asked Mr. Monckton to realise the dangers of delay to the King himself from those who wanted him so much to remain King, that they would take steps to prevent the divorce decree from being mnde absolute(and the risks to the lady herself also. In reply to a question as to how long the King was likely to require to consider the question, Mr. Monckton I said it was more likely to be weeks than days. He would guess that Hi6 Majesty might require two weeks. !THE PRIME MINISTER said it would be impossible to go away for Christmas without a settlement and other Ministers thought that this was much too lony.The danger wae also mentioned of a rapid drifting away in the Dominions from the idee of
monarchy -   a point which mi^ht soon become of great importance.     There was also the safety of the realm to consider.     The passing of this Act was likely to alienate some of the sympathy that would otherwise go out with the King.It was recalled that the King was understood from the first to have been very desirous not to undermine the position of his successor* but if three weeks elapsed the position of the Throne might be very different from what it was to-day.As Mr. Monokton had not even the draft of the statement   it was proposed to make on the morrow* Mr. Chamberlain handed him a copy and gave him permission to show It to the King.(Note:   Mr. Monekton was given the newdraft which appears at the end of the Appendix.;MR. MONCKTGN thought the King would not be likely to raiso any difficulty about the amendment to the last paragraph.THE PRIMrJ MINISTER then brought the proceedings to a conclusion.     He thought it would be useless for him to see the Leaders of the Opposition* but he would see the ..rehbi shop/Who wss in a special position.MR. l-iUNCIMAN said he thought that someone should see the Leaders of Non-Conformist opinion* not about the proposed Bill which he and his colleagues had rejected but on the general position.THK PRIME MINISTER said he would try and see them on the morrow.     He reminded his colleagues that they wure to meet the same evening at 6.30 p.m.!*  ^itehall Gardens, 3.&apos;...1. r D cember, 1956.
Yes Sir.    I am jlpd to have the oooo.rtunity of making a further statement on the ooriMon.In considering this matter the whole Kou?e will desire to have regsrd to the necessity of assuring to His Majesty the full opportunity of weighing a decision which involves so directly his own future happiness and the interests of all his subjects.At the same time they cannot but be aware that any unnecessary prolongation of the present stgte of suspense and uncertainty would involve risk of the gravest injury to National and Imperial interests.After the statement which I made on Friday dealing with the suggestion that what is   called a morganatic marriage might be legalised,  it must be considered what other courses are open to His Majesty&apos;s consideration.His Majesty might, of course, decide to renounce the present project of marriage.    But if it is adhered to the alternatives left would apoear to be strictly limited and no doubt His Majesty, before expressing his desires, will consider such indications as he has already received of the views of his Governments.As scon as His Majesty has arrived at a conclusion as to the course he desires to take he will no doubt communicate it to his Governments, and it will then be for his Governments to decide what further advice, if any, they would feel it their duty to tender to him in the light of his conclusion.In view of the statements which have boen made about the relations between the Government and the King, I should add that, with the exceotisn of the question of morganatic marriage, no formal advice has been tendered to his Majesty with whom all my conversations have been-1-
informal.   These matters were not raised first by the Government hut by His Majesty himself in conversation with me some weeks ago when he first informed me of his intention to marry Mrs. Simpson whenever she should be free.    The subject has,  therefore, been for sons time in the King&apos;s mind and His Majesty has been graciously pleased to give an assurance that he fully recognises the necessity of a very early decision.
