On His Majesty&apos;s ServiceMOST SECRET TO BE OPENED PERSONALLY BY



&apos;mqst secret.THE KING-.CABINET 69 (?6)  Wednesday, December 2nd.. 1956.The Prime Minister said that he was to see the King at 6 p.m. that evening, at His Majesty&apos;s request. All he wanted to be in a position to say was that the Cabinet did not consider that legislation in respect of a marriage under which Mrs Simpson would not become Queen was practicable.   He had again seen the Leader of the Labour Opposition, who had told him that not a single member of the Labour Party would vote for such a Bill.   The Leader of the Opposition Liberals was still considering ohe matter and he hoped to see him that afternoon.   His enquiries did not indicate that the Government&apos;s supporters would vote for legislation of this kind.   The Prime Ministers of ^ the Dominions were against ohe proposal, with the sole exception of New Zealand, whose Prime Minister^JthoughtJi-h poooibjp , -awing tcr  the- King&apos; a persunal/----^ bcL+UutLIPrtP11&quot;lflT&apos;H +3r i ^ ponn wn.ii i   [M&lt;i. uft|/.   He then readla telegram from ohe Prime Minister of South Africa, ltwo telegrams from the Prime Minister of Australia, /and a telegram from the Prime Minister of Canada.fy Sir Harry Batterbee, of the Dominions Office, had seen Mr de Valera, who had found himself placed in a very awkward position.   At first he had been inclined to say ohat this was a Protestant business and that in a Roman Catholic country divorce had no place, but he had been rather staggered when he discovered that if the King were to abdicate and this was rendered possible by legislation in every other part of the Empire, he would be left with King Edward VIII still as King.-1-
The Prime Minister then informed the Cabinet tliat articles had begun that day to appear in certain provincial newspapers.   He feared that it would be the beginning of a serious newspaper storm.The Secretary of State for Dominion Aifairs, referring to the telegram from the Prime Minister of New Zealand, saic that Mr Nash, the Treasurer of New Zealand, who had travelled through the United States on his way to London, was emphatically in favour of abdication as the only possible course.   There was little doubt that he would get in touch with his Prime Minister on the subject.The Secretary of State for War suggested the possibility that Mrs Simpson might go abroad ostentar tiously for twelve months, on the understanding that the whole matter was to be adjourned during her absence. He suggested this because he felt that the Cabinet ought not to accept a possible decision by one King to abdicate without urying to find some way out of the difficulty.The Prime Minister felt sure that the feeling in the country would not diminish but would get greater with ohe lapse of time.   He doubted if the King, in his present mood, would be willing to stay away from Mrs Simpson for twelve months .The Prime Minister&apos;s view met with strong support.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should be authorised to tell ohe King their g  view thajtjfit would be Palj -i i &lt;]-to  &apos;v -pro&lt;5bed with any legislation designed^ to enable him to marry Mrs SimpsonU/W* 1 * u
