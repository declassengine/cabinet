PROPOSED CON-FBRENCS HITA THE LOCARNO POWERS .The Position of Belgium in.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 60 (36) , Conclusion 1.)2. The Cabinet had before tne in CP .-295 (35), covering a Report by tne Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 126^-B), togetner witn an extract from tnt draft Minutes of tne 2b3rd Meeting of the Committee of Lmperial Defence, on tne subject of txie Position of Belgium in the proposed Five-Power Conference.   The Conclusions reached by the Committee of Imperial Defence were as follows &quot;To recommend  (a) Tnat approval snould be given to tne Report by the Cnief3 of Staff Sub-Committee (CI.D. Paper No .1269-3) , the conclusions of wnicn are summarised in paragraph 15 as follows:-&apos;(i) From tne military point of view, His Majesty&apos;s lioveminent snould not asx tnat in tne new Treaty Belgium snould guarantee tne United Kingdom; and(ii)  From the military point of view, His Majesty&apos;s iiovern-ment snould not support txie view of tne French dovernment that in tne new Treaty Belgium should guarantee Prance (and Germany) .&apos;(b) That tne neport snould. be submitted to the Cabinet together with tne Minutes of tne Committee on txies ub je ct&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs supported the view of the Chiefs of Staff Subcommittee*   In any event it woul   not be possible, he said, after all that had happened, to induce the Belgians to change their policy.   The French, after being upset at first, had now accosted the situation and would probably devote themselves to- txie military side of the new position.Referring to the view expressed by the Chiefs ofStaff in Para. 9 of their Report that -Whatever the pos  tion of Belgium in any new Treaty that may be negotiated, otxicr, of course, than a definite alliance, we should not be committed to military conversations, either with France or with Belgium&quot;,
he said that, as a sequel to the London Agreementof March 19, 1936, we had agreed to conversationsin certain contingencies, bat the conveisationswould nave to be with all tne parties and thereforewould be less serious then conversations with onlyPrance or Belgium.The Cabinet agreed  To approve recommendation (a) of the Cniefs of Staff Couvh-ttee contained in CP .-295 (36) and quoted above.
FRANCE.Proposed Convert ations .(Prev ioas Reference: Cabinet 4 (36) , Conclusion 3 .)3.     in the course of tne discussion on tne preceding item the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said tnat tne Frencn government would li^e to nold conversations with tne Britisn Uoveriiment. In favour of a Frencn visit to London ue said tnat a visit by k. Blum and M  Delbos would assist tne present Frencn Government, Wnicn was mtt b y one to worjt witn.   As against tnis, sucn conversations mignt be regarded as a counter to tne recent visit by the Italian Foreign Minister to Berlin^   Re did not asK for an immediate decision, but requested tne Cabinet to turn tne matter over In their minds.A snort discussion too*, place, in tne course of wnicn it was suggested tnat a meeting of tne British and Frencn Governments at tne present time would be regarded publicly as a lining up against Germany .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was asked to give tne Cabinet as mucn notice as possible before asKing for a decision on tne matter.
I FOREIGN AFFAIRS.I Debate on the | Address.France .German-.4.   Tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsgave tne Cabinet a summary of tne line ne proposedto take on various aspects of Foreign Affairs in taftDebate on tne Address.   Re proposed to begin wita areaffirmation of tne line ne nad ta^en at ueneva inregard to tne League of Nations and tne amendment ofits ioacninerj .   He proposed tnen to describe ourrelations witn tne principal European Powers.So far as France was concerned ne proposed, to sa^tnat our relations were close and cordial and nadnever been better in recent times.    It was yernapsinevitable, in present circumstanees, that democraciessnould 9e dra. n togetner in friendsnip, but tnere wasnothing exclusive about such friendsnip.(NOT.E: The Secretary of State was aeiud to substitute tne word, &quot;natural&quot; for &quot;inevitable&quot;JHe proposed, to recall tnat the Communique issuedafter tne Anglo-1-r: ncii-Eelgian Meeting on July 23,1936, nad expressed a generous readiness to open anev. c.aapter in European relations .(NOTE:   Tne Secretary of State was asued to consider wnetner tne words &quot;generous readiness&quot; were &apos;.ell cnosen from tne point of view of tne jer.,.an attitude.)Tne Secretary of State tnen proposed to t^rn to tne case of Germany and to reciprocate tne desire expressed by Rerr Hitler for friendly relations, but to explain tnat our friendship could, not be exclusive. He proposed, also to refe- to the ex-Service ^enT s exchange of visits and to recall tnat tne German Chancellor, as an ex-cervice ..An himself, was acutely conscious of tne value of sucn visits.Some discussion too*, vlace on the question of tne references to Germany .   It was pointed out that tne Germans want our friendship in order to resist-6-
Bolshevism, and tne terms of tne statement as read by tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested tnat tnat was the one thing tnat was barred; indeed, to bar it would cut across tnj3 wuole of tne German polic,, , wnicn was based on t^eir anti-Bolsnevist attit ude .One suggestion was tnat tne Secretary of utate for Foreign Affairs, instead of referring to tne fact tnat our friendship to Germany could not be exclusive, snould state tnat we looxed. forward to a friendship wnicn would enable us to include otner nations besides German, .   An alternative suggestion to tnis was tnat ne snould state tnat v.e are friends of France and wa^t to be friends witn Germany also.   Tnat, now ever, was criticised on tne ground tnat it nad been stated so often tnat it nad become a platitude.Tne Cabinet were asked to remember Herr Hitler&apos;s offer of a 25-years pact of non-aggression, and the question was asked v.nether the Secretary of State should not fasten on that point .   Tne reply to tnis was tnat Germany was already  committed to non-aggression by the Kellogg Pact witnout any limitation. It was recalled, however, tnat Herr hibbentrop nad stated tnat tne 25 years was only mentioned as a round figure and tnat it was not intended tnat peace should come to an end on its termination.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested tnat it was rather diffie~.lt to single out tnat one proposal of 25 years.Another suggestion was tnat tne Secretary of State 8no aid adopt a very friendly attitude towards Germany, but snould make it quite clear tuat we were not going to let tne Germans &quot;pull tne wool over our ears &quot; .
Yet another suggestion was tnat tne Secretary ofState, on concluding his allusion to our relationswith France, snould continue in some such ter...s astne following:-&quot;But a general settlement in Europe depends not onl^ on our relations witn France but also on those with Germany &quot; .Tnls proposal was generally welcomed.Tne Cabinet were then reminded that tne salient fact in Germany today was txxe adoption of a four-years plan, the effect of wh .ch w&amp;s that Germany must continue tightening ner belt for another four years.    It was no v. being represented to tne German public by General Goering and Dr. Goebels as being due to tne maltreatment of Germany by a heartless world in general and by tnis countr^  in particular. Tne result was tnat a daxigerous situation nad arise.., Whicn % as really due to the lack of foreign exchange in Germany.   That, again, arose from tne fact tnat tne available foreign exchange was utilised for purchases in connection with German armaments, and it was tnat which nad brought about a dangerous situation.   To avert internal trouble, German Ministers were stirring jlj? tneir people to tnihu tnat tnese imtsfortunes were due to tnis country . Tne exchange difficulty  could be surmounted if Germaiy could send out more exports,   .ve ought, tnerefore, it was suggested, to see now far it was possible to ease tnat situation and thereby to relax the Germandifficulties.No ^articular solution was offered, out it was recalled tnat in tne course of tne Ger.._an-Italian talxs rcfercx-.ce xiad been _.ade to txie possibility of
tut adoption of methods for Inoreasing German exports to countries whioja would include tne i.anubiaa States. (&lt;as it wortnwnile, it was asked, for tne secretary of ..tate for Foreign Affairs to indicate tnis difficulty and to say that if any wa&gt; could be found for easia..  tne economic difficulties we snould be prepared to give it favourable consideration&apos;One comment on this proposal was tnat it would nelp Germany to re-arm.Another comment was tnat Germany&apos;s anxieties arose largely fro^a ner apprehensions of tne unemplOy  ant situation Wnen sne nad completed ner armaments . Tne v^oposal was tnerefore useful only to a limited, extent.    In any event tne Germans were not lively to relax tneir efforts to make tne .selves sclf-sufficient as part of tneir general policy .Nevertheless , a good, deal of support was given to tat suggestion tnat efforts snould be ^ade to ease tae present tension in Germany, and tnat, as action on tne political side was ver, diffico.lt, it snould be found, if possible, on the economic side. Tne Cabinet were re._inde , nowever, of tae difficulty tnat Germany exported to a large exteat tne same class of articles as tnis country.Tne Minister for1 Co-ordination of Defence said, taat his difficulty was to *now what our yolic,, wa6 and v.nat kind of possibility our defensive ^repara-tions were intended to .^eet.   Collective security ( nad disappeared and nothing nad been substituted for it.   He tnougat that if we were wording for tne appe.-se^eat of Germany&apos;s econo.mc conditio as ne would feel t at we nad a policy for which there was some nope.-b-
Former German Colonies.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 57 (3 5) , Conclusion b.;The Rome Secretary asked tnat if tne line proposed were to be worked out it snould be introduced by repudiating the suggestion t^al we were tne cause of Germany&apos;s troubles.Tne Cabinet agreed  That tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs snould confer with tne Chancellor of tne Exchequer as to tne line to be taKen in reference to German} , and report to tne Prime Minister tne following morning.Tne preceding discussion led directly to consideration of tne reference t o oe made to the former German colonies.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read the following draft of his proposed remarKs on the s ub j e ct: -&quot;I come to tne question of the ex-German colonies .    i must taake it clear at once tuat His Majesty&apos;s Government in tne United Kingdom have already pronounced tneir views and attitude.   Tney are not prepared to be drawn into furtner discussion on this subject either by questions in this country or by speakers in Germany antil the European settlement whicn I have already referred lo nas been reached.   In tne meanwhile, so far as we are concerned, tne colonial issue is not even discussible.On tne cognate question of raw materials, now ever, His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully prepared, and have for more tnan a year been prepared, to examine the question in all its aspe cts .&quot;Tne comment was made tnat tne Cabinet nad nevertaKen any decision on this subject., resolutionshad been passed at tne meeting of the ConservativeParty at Margate which could not be ignored, aridtne House of Commons would expect so..,e fairlyde mite reference to t.:e matter.   The suggestiontnat at present the. colonial issue was not even&quot;discussible&quot; was criticised as being ratner toostiff.
The suggestion was made t.iat tne real Intention was to say tnat we were not prepared to be drawn into fartxier discussion on this subject &quot;in advance of&quot; tne European settle^ent.   Tnis was criticised, nowever, on tne ground tnat if a European settlement were reached, Herr hitler would assume tuat some coiicession would be made in tne  colonial field.One suggestion was a statement to tne following effe ct:-&quot;If and wnen we are satisfied txi .t tne colonial question is tne only one o ut s ta nd ing, it w o uld b e cr iminal to refuse to look at it.&apos;&apos;Anotner suggestion was tnat tne Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs snould. tar:e up tne colonial pointfrom tne basis of tne reference in recent Set-manspeeches to their economic difficulties, and recalltnat ne nad raised, tnat issue at ueneva more tnan ayear ago.Doubt was expressed, nowever, as to wnetner this was a wise course, for although it. was true tnat tne Germans had said tx at tneir economic difficulties were great, nevertheless we knew tnat what tnej really wanted was colonies .   They would say tnat we were evading tne real issue.   Pernaps, novever, the best course would, be to avoid any serioas mention of colonies and. to la,, stress on tne German economic difficult ies.Yet another s^gges ion was tnat tat Cabinet s.,oalo. adnere to tne announcement on tne subject made by- the Secretary of ct.^.te fo   Foreign Affairs in July .Several ..e...bers of tne Cabinet urged tnat it would, be better not to raise tne question of colonies except in the most distant terms, maintaining the July position.-10-
Italy .Relations wit a .(Previoas Reference: Cabinet 51 (35), Conclusion 2 .)The Cabinet agreed  Tnat tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultation witii tne Cnaneellor of tne Exchequer, should1 consider wnat line ne snould taxe and inform tne Prime Minister on tne following morning Tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to tne Cabinet tne references to Italy in nis dra^t speech.    It would be necessary to recall tnat our differences witn Italy were due to our support to tne League of Nations and. tnat such differences as still existed were due to our divergent views as to now affairs in &quot;Europe should be conducted.   He proposed to quote tne references in Signor Mussolini&apos;s recent speecn in Milan to tne Mediterranean and to combat tne suggestion tnat for tne British Empire tne Mediterranean was merely a snort cut, pointing out tnat it was in fact a main arterial ro^te.   He would not dispute Signor Mussolini&apos;s claim tnat tne Mediterranean was of supreme importance to  ttalj . He would taxe note of Signor Mussolini&apos;? last sentence, in whicn he had indicated tnat ne did not propose to interrupt any nation&apos;s communi cat ions through tne Mediterranean, to which nt would reply &quot;Nor do we&quot; .In tne course of the discussion the minister for Co-ordination of Defence reminded tne Foreign Secretary tnat tne Chiefs of Staff, in tne^r recent Reports, nad. reiterated tne great importance of better relations witn Italy . . The ..ili tarj situation in tne Mediterranean presented very great difficulties whicn cropped up in co..sidering every question. Tne proposed base at Cyprus, for example, co^ld only be justified as a &quot;one war&quot; proposition.   Tne solution of many of our difficulties was improved relations with Italy .   The position was not tne same as it was-11-
towards Germany , wnere, if we gave an inch, we were asked for an ell.    It vas probable tnat tne Italian desire for good relations witn tnis country was genuine .The First Lord of tne Admiralty and tne Secretary of State for  ar strongly supported tne proposal of tne Minister for Co-ordination of Defence .Tne Secretary of State for roreign Affairs agreed in principle, but sai.&apos; tnat tne question was rather difficult to nandle and ne would nave to proceed cautiously.Tne Minister for Co-ordination of Defence agreed.It was pointer&apos; out, however, tnat our difficulty arose out of tne Abyssinian troubles.   Tnai situation could not be reversed, and it would be better to re cognise it.The Secretary of State for tne Colonies supported tne proposal.   Tne anti-Britisn attitude, ne pointed out, was reflected in Italian propaganda in our colonies, wnich would stop if we could get better ter-.s with Italy.Tne First Commissioner of  (OrKS suggested, that tne best wa, of handling tne question was to state tnat ve recognised that txj.e u editerranean was a very important route for all European nations;   t.^at we desired to keep it o^en for all nations, including Italy .The Lord President of tne Council agreed that tne more Europe as a wnole could be orougiit in, tne better.Tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to include, in nis draft some friendly references to Italy, on the lines suggested.-12-
SPAIN .I Possible Recog-I nit ion ofInsurgents  (Previous Reference s: Cabinet 5b (36), Conclusion 5.and Cabinet 60 (36), Conclusion 3 .)5. Tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs -   warned tne Cabinet tnat tne French were adopting rat ner a different line from tnat wnicn nad been decided by; tne Cabinet at tne first of the two Meetings referred to in tne margin.   TasSj were withdrawing tneir Cnarge d&apos;Affaires from madrid and did not apparently contemplate recognising tne insurgents as belligerents     He was doing nis best to bring Frencn volicj into line with our own.In re^ly to a question ne said tnat although, under tne proposal approved bj tne Cabinet, we should recognise tne insurgents as belligerents, we snould be free to ^ive them belligerent rignts or not as we mignt wish.   All tnat really was involved was that we snould nave relations witn tnen as a de facto &apos;aoverxiuent.Continuing, tne Secretary of State said tnat ne nad received reports tnat Italian sni .s were watching tne traffic into S^ain ratner carefully.Tne First Lord of tne Admiralty said tnat tne Italians had sent two submarines to tne Eastern mediterranean, apparently with orders to iittWfV+it &apos;fawiesign irj.i&apos;Ointo to S^aiu.    In tne western mediterranean also Italian warships were snowing great activity, and it looked as tnougn tney mignt be L*J&amp;4xd&lt;&gt; inter ecptii&apos;ig Russian snips.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added tnat ne nad received a somewhat disturbing telegram tnat morning reporting a conversation oeH&apos;een Count Cerruti and M, Leger, of tne Quai d&apos;Grsay, in the course of wnicn tne Italian Ambassador nad s^o^en of the intention of Italy to wage &quot;are guerre idealogioue&quot; against Bolshevism, and nad snown mucn embarrassment wnen asJted if tne Italians were going to sto^ tne entry of r.assian war material into Syain.-13-
IBAQ.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 88(35) Conclusion 5. )6.    The Secretary of State for foreignAffairs reported that the recent military coupd&apos;etat in Iraq had come as 8 complete surprise.The reasons were probsbly either militaryirritation with Iraq. Ministers or Dossibly ithad been fomented by the Kin:.; of Iraq.General Bekr sidlci, having apparently thecomplete support of the Army,  is the &quot;Dowerbehind the Government.    lie had once been atthe Staff College, Cambrrley, but subsequentlycame into the oublic eye as a somewhat crueland ruthless leader against the Assyrians.The Secretary of State suggested that thequestion of the oossible use of the Assyriansfor military purposes, e.g.  a3 a garrison forCvorus,  if they &gt;vere required, should beconsidered.The Cabinet agreed:That the possible enlistment of the Assyrians for military purposes should be considered by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for 7ar.
ABYSS JLNIA .Retention of Legation Guard at Addis Ababa.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 38 (36), Con-clus ion 5 .)7.   Tne Cabinet nad before tnem a memorandum by tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-2yi (36)) suggesting tnat autnority be given to withdraw tne Legation Guard at Addis Ababa wnen tne moment appeared opportune.    It was proposed, now ever, to ensure tnat on tne withdrawal of tne Guard tne Italian High Coriimand would assume full responsibility for tne safety of tne Legation staff and property.The Secretary of State for Foraign Affairs said he would like to have proposed at the., same time to remove the Legation from Addis Ababa, but he wanted first to get the French Government into line on the subject.The Cabinet approved the proposed withdrawal of the British Legation Guard at Addis Ababa and authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take action when he considered the moment opportune.
PALESTINE . Immigration.Proposed Anno uncement.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 50 (36), Con-clasion 5.)G.    The Cabinet had before tnem a toe mo random bytne Secretary of State for tne Colonies (CP.-292(35))  covering (a) self-explanatory telegraphiccorrespondence with tne iigh ConxiiissiOher forPalestine on outstanding points raised at tneMeeting referred to in tne margin:    (b) a draftStatement wnich the Secretary of State proposed tomaxe in tne Hoose of Commons on tne following dayon tne subject of Immigration*The Secretary of State for the Coloniesreported that he had not only written toDoctor Weizmann after the last meeting, but had alsoseen him.     He had not had time to circulate hisreport of his conversation to the Cabinet buthad sent it to those of his colleagues who werespecially interested.     Doctor Weizmann hadpromised to make every effort to keep the numbersdown.     He reported that, according to the latestinformation from the High Commissioner, the totalJewish immigrants in the next six months is notlikely to exceed 8,000.Some discussion took place as to thefollowing passage in the draft statement(CP. 292 (36) Appendix II, second paragraph) :-&quot;It is, in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, right that the status quo should be maintained pending the report of the Royal Commission;    and &quot;The Secretary ef State for Foreign Affairs suggested an alternative draft which was adopted (see below).The Secretary of State for War reported that the War Office were reducing the garrison at Palestine and were keeping in close touch withthe Colonial Office in this matter,1 , -
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the draft statementproposed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies subject to(b) The substitution for the sentencequoted above of   a   sentence on the following lines:-&quot;It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that, if any drastic departure from the immigration policy hitherto pursued were now to be introduced in advance of the findings of the Royal Commission, this would involve alteration in the existing situation and might be held to prejudice the enquiries of the Royal Commission.&quot;
PUBLIC ORDER.Preservation of.Draft Bill.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 60 (36), Conclusion79.   Tne Cabinet nad before them, tne followingdocuments on tne subject of tne Preservation ofPublic Ordtr:-A Report by tne Cabinet Committee (C,P.-2b2 (36)), further consideration of wnicn had been postponed at tne Meeting referred to in tne margin until a Bill in final draft could be laid before tnem:A Memorandum by tne Rome Secretary (C.P.-290 (36))  covering a draft Public Order Bill and containing a summary of tne more important provisions contained tnerein.   The Rome Secretary asked Cabinet autnority for tne early introduction of tne Bill .The Home Secretary reported that his enquiries as to the attitude of the Parliamentary Opposition had produced a highly satisfactory result.

STATE.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 56(36J Conclusion 3.)16.     The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to a speech made on the previous day by Mr. de Valera.
