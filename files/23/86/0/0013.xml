THE KING&apos;S INTENTION TO MARRY.Proposed Eroadcast hy the King.1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the King was anxious to broadcast a statement to the nation and the Empire on the subject of his intention to marry, and had asked the Prime Minister to consult the Cabinet on the matter.    At the Prime Minister&apos;s request His Majesty had caused a copy of a draft of the proposed broadcast to be transmitted to him thatMmorning.In the course of the discussion the Home Secretaiy communicated the text of a note of certain propositions to make quite plain the constitutional position of the King in the case of broadcasting as in the case of any other form of publio address.    These propositions met with general approval.    They were slightly amended after the Meeting of the Cabinet, and as amended form part of Appendix I.The Cabinet were reminded that a broadcast by the King on a natter affecting the whole Commonwealth would require the assent of the Governments of the Dominions as well as of the United Kingdom.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That their advice to the King on theproposed broadcast shoula be transmitted to His Majesty by the Prime Minister in writing.(NOTE: A copy of the Prime Minister&apos;s communication as sent the same afternoon to th* King is attached in Appendix I.     The draft was prepared fortne Prime Minister by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretaiy and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.)A copy is  n record in the Secretary&apos;s file of Cabinet Conclusions.
(b) That the Prime Minister, before sending the above communication to the King, should consult the Leaders of the Opposition Parties in the House of Commons.(c) That the Prime Minister, with the assistance of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, should inform the Prime Ministers of the Dominions by telegram of the above decision (a), and of the exceptional reasons of urgency which had compelled the Cabinet to offer advice to His Majesty on a matter in which the whole Commonwealth was concerned without conforming to the normal practice of prior consultation with the Dominions.
ITHE KING&apos;S INTENTION 70 MARRY.2. The Cabinet were informed by the Prima Minister of the position reached on the question of the King&apos;s intention to marry as it resulted from the Audienoes he had had with His Majesty on Wednesday, December 2nd, and on the previous evening.At the former Audience he had informed His Majesty of the Cabinet&apos;s decision , taken the same morning, that, in view of the result of enquiries made as to opinion in the House of Commons and in the Dominions, it would be impossible to proceed with any legislation designed to enable the King to marry Mrs&quot;Simpson without his wife becoming Queen.After discussing the question in all its aspects the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should make a statement in Parliament the sane afternoon setting forth the Constitutional position on proposals that had been made and which had appeared in certain organs of the Press, that, if the King decided to marry, his wife need not become Queen.(A copy of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement is attached in Appendix II.     The draft was prepared for his use by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary and the Minister for- Co-ordination of Defence. )(b) That the Prime Minister should the same day represent to the King the dangerous political situation which might arise throughout the Empire if the present uncertainty as to His Majesty&apos;s intentions in the matters arising out of his intention to marry continued, and should ask His Majesty to notify his decisions on the grave issues involved at the earliest practicable moment, and, if possible, in time for announcements to be made in Parliament on Monday, December 7th, and to enable any other consequential action to be prepared for.x   By instructions from the Prime Minister this Conclusion was not circulated.
(o) That the Prime Minister, with the assistance of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, should notify the above decisions to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions, with any necessary explanations.(d) That the Lord Privy Seal should arrange for the House of Lords to meet on Monday, December 7th.(e) To take note that the Secretaiy of State fe.r India had, on the previous day, sent a Secret and Personal Telegram to the Viceroy of India acquainting him with the position which had given rise to the present Meeting of the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.V..1, December 4, 1936.
APf-.-&apos;MX I.THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;S COMMUNICATION TO H.M. TKg KING RE PROPOSED BROADCAST.10, Downing Street,S.W. 1.4th December, 1936.Mr. Baldwin, with his humble duty to Your Majesty, -with reference to the draft of a broadcast by Your Majesty which by Your Majesty&apos;s instructions was Placed before the Cabinet to-day, Mr. Baldwin submits the following observations.In the case of broadcasting (as in the case of any other form of public address) there is a fundamental distinction between the position of the King and the position of a orivate oerson.    As long as the King is Xing he can only sneak in public in that capacity.    If a Sovereign takes the formal action which is necessary to renounce the Throne, and if he becomes a subject of the reigning Sovereign, his claim to broadcast stands on quite a different basis. But the suggestion that the Xing should broadcast in the terms proposed is a suggestion that he should broadcast as Xing and while occupying the Throne.    Such a broadcast could only be given on the advice of his Ministers, who would be responsible for every sentence of it.    In these circumstances Mr. Baldwin cannot advise that the Xing should broadcast as proposed.In order to make the constitutional position quite plain Mr. Baldwin appends a note of certain propositions which are well established and universally accepted by U constitutional authorities.    He would call particular attention to the paragraph which points out that the Xing, in present circumstances, could not constitutionally make a broadcast on the topics proposed save on the advice of &amp;I1 his Governments.(Signed) STANLEY BALDWIN.
NOTE.1. It is a fundamental constitutional principle that the King&apos;s Ministers must take responsibility for every public act of the ving, for the King himself can do no wrong;    and it follows as a necessary corollary that Ministers must have the right to tender advice before the act is done.    This principle is the basis of constitutional monarchy and if the King disregarded it, the monarchy would cease to be constitutional.2. Accordingly,  it would be a grave breach of constitutional principle if the Sovereign were to makea public statement on any matter of oublic interest except on the advice of his Ministers.    Whether the medium is the B.B.C. or any other form of address spoken or written makes no difference.    This extends even to replies to loyal addresses oresented by Municipal bodies - a fortiori to a world-wide discourse which manifestly might have constitutional consequences.3. Apparent exceptions to the rule that the King&apos;s public utterances must be such os are approved by his Ministers (such as King George&apos;s Christmas message) are not really exceptions at all.    In such cases Ministers are willing to give an exoerienced Monarch who thoroughly understands and has always strictly observed constitutional limitations, a discretion as to whathe would say, and are content to take full responsibility knowing well that the Monarch will say nothing of which Kis Ministers would not approve.4. The King is bound to accept and act upon the advice of his Ministers in this connection.    For the King to broadcast in disregard of that advice would be appealing over the heads of His constitutional advisers.-ii-
5. There is a further principle involved* The constitutional duty of the King is not to take sides in any matter of public controversy.    If he does so on Ministers&apos; advice, of course they alone are responsible; but if he does so without their advice, or in defiance of it, he ceases to act as a constitutional Monarchand his intervention is calculated to divide His subjects into opposing camps.    It is manifest that the King&apos;s broadcast must have this result.6. Moreover, a Royal broadcast of the nature contemplated could only be given on the advice of all the King&apos;s Governments.    Even if there were a change of government in this country, and new Ministers could be found prepared to authorise such a proceeding, this would avail nothing unless all the Dominion Governments also approved the project..
APPENDIX II.THE PRIMS MINISTER&apos;S STATEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON FRIDAY, DECEMBER 4th, 1936.&quot;In view of widely circulated suggestions as to certain possibilities in the event of the King&apos;s marriage, I think it would be advisable for me to make a statement.    Suggestions have appeared in certain organs of the Press yesterday and again today that if the King decided to marry, his wife need not become Queen.     These ideas are without any Constitutional foundation.     There is no such thing as what is called a morganatic marriage known to our law. The Royal Marriages Act of 1772 has no application to the Sovereign himself.     Its only effect is that the marriage of any other member of the Royal Family is null and void unless the Sovereign&apos;s consent, declared under the Great Seal, is first obtained. This Act, therefore, has nothing to do with the present case.     The King himself requires no consent from any other authority to make his marriage legal, but, as I have said, the lady whom he marries, by the fact of her marriage to the King, necessarily becomes Queen.     She herself, therefore, enjoys all the status, rights and privileges which, both by positive law and by custom, attach to that position, and with which we are familiar in the cases of Her Late Majesty Queen Alexandra and of Her Majesty Queen Mary, and her children would be in the direct line of succession to the Throne.The onlji possible way in which this result could be avoided would be by legislation dealing with a particular case.     His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to introduce such legislation. Moreover, the matters to be dealt with are of common concern to the Commonwealth as a whole, and such a change could not be effected without the assent of all the Dominions.     I am satisfied, from inquiries I have made, that this assent would not be forthcoming.     I have felt it right to make this statement before the House adjourns to-day in order to remove a widespread misunderstanding. At this moment I have no other statement to make.&quot;
m- KING.The Prime Minister eaid tiiat it  ai now obvious, tne Press having got loose, tnat the situation with regard to the King&apos;s marriage oould not be ueld . Some statement was essential, at the latest after tne weekend.   He had asked the Leader of the Labour Opposition not to put a Question that day, but to be available intcase some statement could be made.The Prime Minister said that he had seen the King on Wednesday, December 2nd, and had reported the result of his enquiries as to the proposed Dill to sanction wnat was sometimes called a &quot;morganatic&quot; marriage. He nad said that it was impossible of acceptance by the present blouse of Commons ;   txiat Mr Attlee had told nim the whole of the Labour Party would vote against it, and tnat the Parliamentary secretary to the Treasury-had informed him that the supporters of the Government would be almost unanimous against it.   As to the Dominions, he had not shown the King the text of all the telegrams but had given nim a very  complete sommajy, showing him, in addition, tne important second telegram received from Mr Lyons.   The King had not appeared mucu impressed by all this .   rie himself nad tuen repeated that there were only the following alteratives(1) For the King to give up Mrs Simpson.The King replied that this was impossible, and tne Prime Minister said he knew it.(2) Por the King to marry Mrs Simpson and that she snould become o^aeen.This was also admittedly impossible.(3) For the King to marrj  &quot;morganatically1.But that, as he had just said, was impossible.(4) Por tne King to u arry and abdicate.The King said he knew that before long he would have to abdicate if he married.-1-
Continuing, the Prime Minister said that at tiiat moment the King had, for the first time, been subjected to hostile criticism by the Press and was rather feeling it   as he himself had felt it on the first oocssion when he was subjected to it.    It was obvious that His Majesty was under a strain.   He had said that he had decided not to go to the Black Country;   not tnat he was afraid, but because it was clear that tnese yeople did not want nim, and he had picked up the &quot;Birraingnam Post&quot; as he said this.   There had been a little more talk, but nothing more of importance nad transpired.On the previous day, December 3rd, he was to nave seen the King at 6 p.m., but he received a message from the King&apos;s Valet asking nim to come to Buckingham Palace secretly at 9 p.m.   He had driven there and nad been taken in by a back entrance?   but all tne snnie he had been photographed.   Then he had been introduced through a window.   Sir Godfrey Thomas had awaited him, looking twenty years older.   On this occasion tne King came back to his idea   of a broadcast which he wanted to matte this very evening (December 4th).   Liis Majesty had read to the Prime Minister a draft and had said he thought it right, before he abdicated, that on behalf of Mrs Simyson and himself he should say what tney wanted to do. He had been frantically keen to do this and had said tnat ne felt sure the Prime Minister knew at heart tnat he was right in tnis     The Prime Minister nad replied tnat it was a matter of the Constitution and tn&amp;t he would have to consult the Cabinet.   Making clear tnat he was sneaking informally, he had reminded the King of what he had told nim as to the attitude of nis Cabinet colleagues, the Party Leaders in Parliament and the Prime Ministers of the Dominions:   adding that now the King proposed to go over tne neads of hisFProposed ad cast.
Minister* and talk direct to the people .   lie had gone on to say tnat ne felt certain that when the matter was examined it would be found to be a tnoroughl&gt; unconstitutional prooedure.   The KiriR had been aomewnat impressed by the Constitutional point,   uis Majesty then said &quot;You want me to go, don&apos;t jouf&quot;   The Prime Minister had agreed.   The King had told him tnat he wanted to go with dignity, in the best possible manner for Mrs Simpson and himself and nis successor, and without dividing tne country.Referring to the proposed broadcast, he had continued that the King would be telling millions of people throughout the world, including a vast number of women, that he wanted to marr&gt; a married woman,   tie would have to mention her name.   Everyone would want to know who she was and all about her, and tne newspapers would be full of gosai*.   This would bring the very result that tne Kinp did not want.   To some extent it might divide opinion in the Empire, but undoubtedly it would harden the strongly predominant opinion against the marriage if the King was to staj in his present position.    1nis, the Prime Minister remarked to the Cabinet, was anotner instance of a certain lack of comprehension wnich ne had observed in the King.   He had then recalled to tne King how, as he had previously said, everyone up to now had adopted great restraint in tnis matter, yet ne knew that the religious denominations were straining at the leash.   The King did not in tne least seem to appreciate the importance of this.   The Prime Minister tnen pointed out txxat only three papers were taking tne King&apos;s view, and they were perhaps the worst papers in London   the New8-Cnroniole, the Dailj Mail, and the Daily Express.-3-
In reply to trie Cnancellor of the Exchequer he said he had mentioned tne probable effect of the broadcast on Mrs Sinyeon&apos;8 divorce, namely , tnat if tne King became a private individual there was lea8 yrosyeet of affidavits being lodged .    If there was a broadcast tnis was much more likely, as extremists would certainly try to stop the divorce-   Summing up, ne nad said txiat the ultimate result of the broadcast, in his view, would be that he would nave to pp, witn opinion in tne country divided;   that his exit would be an undesirable one? tnat it would be worse for Mrs Simpson, and worse for hie brother.   The King had used every argument to urge the broadcast, and asked him to consider it.   He had promised to do so.The Prime Minister then asked ijir Jonn Simon toread the draft of the broadcast, wnich nad been brougntto 10, Downing Street, that morning.(The Home Secretary had not got tne draft witn nim, and there was a delay wnile it was sent for, daring which the discussion summarised below tookylace.)Tne Lord Privy Seal asked if ne should arrange for the House of Lords to meet on Monday iThe Prime Minister tnougnt it advisable tnat tnis should be done, tnougn nothing was settled   et as to what was to hayyen.This was at:re^d to*The Secretary of State for India said tnat although he had no Cabinet authority for it, he had tnourht it desirable on the previous evening to send a Personal and Secret communication to the Viceroy .   rte anticiyated that the reactions to the crisis here would be rather serious in India.The Secretary of State for Air asked wnat was the constitutional yoaition as affecting tne yroyosed broadcast?-4-
The Home ^eoretnry said tnat he had tried that morning, though in ?reat haste, to set forth tne position. He then read the six clauses in Appendix I.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat the last paragraph stated tiu position correctlyso far as the Dominions were concerned .(The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury entered at this point to report that the Leader of the Labour Opposition insisted that he could not avoid putting a Question to tne Prime Minister that morning. He thought it essential that tne Prime Minister himself should give tne Answer, even if it was to the effect tnat he had nothing to add to what he had said on the previous day . He asked, tnerefore, tnat the Prime Minister should come into the House at 11 a.m.)The Secretary of State for Scotland suggested tnat,as the Cabinet were now embarking on   very importantpart of their discussion, it wouic be better to adjournfor a few minutes until the Prime Minister had answeredhis Question in the House.(The Cabinet adjourned from 10.55 a.m. until 11.7 a.m.)The PrimeMinister said that altnough Mr Winston Churchill had tried to repeat his request of tne previous day, that no decision should be taken by the Goverament without prior discussion in Parliament, tne Speaker nad not allowed tne matter to be pursued, and his own reply had been accepted.The Home Secretary then read a draft of tne King&apos;s proposed broadcast (Au^endix II). which had been brought to 10, Downing Street, that morning by Mr T. Monckton, K.C.,M.C., Attorney General to the Duchy of Cornwall, wno was advising the King on the legal issues.The Home Secretary thought the first sentence an extraordinary statement. The King had received some instruction in Constitutional Law at Oxford University- -
under Sir rfilliam Anson, where Mr Moncxton nad also been in residence at the same time,   &lt;le ought to have Known that the King did not address his public utterances to his people &quot;By ancient custom&quot;.   The fifth paragraph, &quot;I could not go on bearing the heavy burdens that constantly rent on me as King unless L could be strengthened in the task by a happy married life? and so I am firmly resolved to marry the woman I love when she is free to marry me&quot;, was really a contradiction to ills own statement to the Prime Minister tnat if he married Mrs Simpson he would abdicate.The Cnancellor of the Bxcnequer pointed out tnat the broadcast in effect strengthened the Prime Minister&apos;s position as to a morganatic marriage, which the Cabinet had advised against.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointed out that immediately the King made tnis broadcast the Cabinet would become responsible for giving the people tnat advice.   The only alternative was to refuse responsibility, which involved resignation.    If the broadcast took place tnere were only two alternatives for the Cabinet,- either to take responsibility or to resign.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said the Cabinet must advise against tne broadcast, and if it was made they must resign.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs doubted if the Cabinet ought properly to adviee witnout consultation with the Dominions.The Chancellor of tne Exchequer suggested that tne Cabinet might advise tne King tnat tne broadcast concerned tne Dominions as well as tnis country, and give their own advice so far as the Government of Vne United Kingdom was concerned .-
The Secretary of wtate for Dominion Affairs, as an alternative, suggested that they might give tne advice informally, saying tnat that was wnat the&gt; would advise but as yet thej had not had time to consult tne Dominions .The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that it was only If tney wantec&apos;. to advise tne broadcast should take place tnat the Cabinet would nave to consult the Dominions .The Prime Minister agreed .The Secretary of State for Air suggested tnat the Cabinet should say that the constitutional position was clear tnat the King could not make the broadcast witnout the advice of the Cabinet and of the Dominions .The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said the Cabinet knew in effect that no Dominion would give arn advice except in opposition to the broadcast. He was anxious to keep tne constitutional position correct* If His Majesty realised tuat it was not constitutional to broadcast unless he had the consent of the Dominion Governments, and if he wanted tne Cabinet to allow tne broadcast, the advice of the Dominions would have to be obtained.    Informally, nowever, the Cabinet could tell tne King what their own advice would be and what they anticipated would be tne advice of the Dominions . Tnen we coulc&apos; get in touch with tne Dominiona.   That would have the effect which the Cabinet desired, of stopping the broad cast.The Home Secretary sail tnat the very fact of having to consult the Dominions showed tnat the advice of the Unite Kingdom alone could put a stop to tne broadcast.   So far as Australia was concerned the decision was one for the Commonwealth Cabinet, but tne United Kingdom Cabinet was responsible here.-7-
The Secretary of State for Scotland observed that the fact that the machine functioned here did not alter the fact that the King could change uis advisers in the United Kingdom, though he could not do that with the same facility in the Dominions.The Secretary of State for A/ar pointed out that tne Home Government was not responsible for collecting the views of tne Dominions, but they were in a position to advise direct.   They might advise the King tnat he must consult the Dominions, but tnat the Cabinet here were also entitled to give advice.The Secretary of State for India agreed. He thought the Cabinet should give their advice so far as they were concerned .The Secretary of State for Scotland surges ted that the Cabinet were tne trustees for tne Empire.   (Tnis was queried .)The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the advice of tne Dominion Governments had to be given direct to the King, but when trie King was contemplating action he wanted to preserve tne principle tnav it was not right for one Government to advise alone on a matter tnat was one of common concern.    It would be setting an undesirable precedent.Tne Minister of Labour queried as to wnat would be the -position if tne Cabinet did not act and the broadcast took place?The Chancellor of tne Exchequer thought it woul^ be sufficient for the Cabinet to give their own advice and to add that every Dominion must be consulted. There was danger in delay.This  a3_e,greed tP  The Lord Privy Seal sal- tnat we snould at the sa^e time explain matters to the Dominions .-b-
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreed that in the circumstances the Cabinet might take the responsibility of giving their own advioe, if cons citation with the Dominions involved a dangerous delay. They would then have to explain matters to the Dominions.The Lord President of the Council said that every minute of delay involved danger,   tie thought the matter should be settled at once, and that advice snould be given to vhe King on the lines of the Home liecretar^11 draft &apos;Abudja U)  The Home Secretary tnougnt that the last paragraph of Appendix I covered the whole of the Dominions point.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreed.Tne Ctiancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the King might counter the Dominions point by saying tnat he would only address the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed out that, even tnough he was addressing this country only, the King would be saying things tnat affected the Dominions and therefore would not be justified in broadcasting without the advice of the Governments of tne Dominions .The Lord Privy Seal suggested the possibility tnat the King, who must be suffering under severe nervous strain, might get noli of Sir John itelth in aplte of the advice of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that Sir John Keith would not allow a broadcast to take place without consulting the Government.The First Lord of tne Admiralty asked that some consideration might be given to the snape of tne reyly . It should be on such lines as not to give an opportunity for Mr Churchill and nis friends to say tnat tne
Cabinet would not even alio* tne King to pat hie case before the nation.   He might say that a broadcast was oat of the question at the present juncture but tnat there would be no difficulty in arranging for the King to bid farewell to the nation after his abdication.The Chancellor of the Excheaer said that the difficulty in tnis  course was tuat the King had not yet agreed to abdicate.    Lt would look, therefore, as though the Cabinet were putting pressure on nim to abdicate.   They might say, however, tnat it was only wnile he was King that he could not broadcast.The Minister of Agriculture ano. Fisheries said tuat the Cabinet could onl,, advise His Majesty while he was King.The Minister of Health was anxious to avoid giving the impression of pushing tne King out during the weekend .The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries agreed .The President of the Board of Trade urged tnat tnt Cabinet should be careful to keep on the constit.utional ground .Tne Lord Privy Seal said tnat, like the First Lord, he was conscious of the danger arising from the manner in which the advice was offered.The Secretary of State fibr flar said tnat this matter was affected by the method in which tne abdication took place.   A Cabi;iet Committee had been appointed on tnis subject.   Had they explored the question?Tne Prime Minister said that the procedure would not be complete until a Bill had been passed through Parliament.The Secretary of State for &lt;var suggested that the King ougnt to wait until the Bill was passed before he made his broadcast.-10-
The Lord President of tne Cour.uil thought it was a mistake at. the present moment to refer to some future broadcast.   Tne reply would be adequate if it referred to the constitutional position.The Minister of Health pointed out that tne First Lord&apos;s idea wae to hold out the nope that after abdication tne King could broar* or&gt; st.The Home Secretary thought that the King&apos;s personal adviaera had never really contemplated abdication. The waj to deal witn the Firat Lord&apos;s point waa to emphasise tuet a man who wan King could not broadcast without the advice of his Gov eminent.    It was unnecessary to emphz-sise that he coul&quot; broadcast after abdication.   The correct method was to emphasise tiiat 30 long as he was King he could only do it on tne advice of the Governments concerned,   tfhat was evidently in the King&apos;s mind was to address His People before he abdicated, and on this he 3eemed to have made up his mind .   It must be emphasised that so long as he waa King ne could not broadcast without Government approval.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that people might say that if the Government did not allow the King to broadcast this statement, what statement would they allow?   This would put the uovernment in the position of having to suggest a broadcast.The Home Secretary said that the reply was that tiie King, if he had something to say on the broadcast, must communicate it first to   Ministers.   Q,ueen victoria, for example, had notified ner intention to marry to tne Government through the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. The Government wae the proper recipient for such declarations.   The fundamental objection to a broadcast wan tnat any announcement by the King had to be made to Ministers and not. to the people.-n-
The Secretary of State for .rfar suggested that the Cabinet mignt give the King an alternative draft to broad cast.The Chancellor of the Bxchequer said, the Constitutional position being that the King, if he was to broadcast, must only do so In languagr approved by Ministers, this might thro* on to the Government the burden of drafting his broadcast.    If tne King&apos;s intention was to marry Mrs Simpson he ought first to communicate it to the House of Commons and the House of Lords.   After that he might pernapa be allowed to broa^ cast.The Minister of Health suggested that tne Cabinet&apos;s objection was to this particular broadcast.   If the King wanted to broadcast he could do so, but only on the advice of Ministers .The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that was correct.   The Cabinet&apos;s repl., should be tiiat their objection was to a particular broadcast. They had no right to advise the King to give a broadcast which was contrary to die Majesty&apos;s wisnes .   If the King wanted to broadcast he must submit the draft to his Ministers .Tne Prime Minister said tnat, speaking for himself, he had told the King informally that,though he had not yet consulted his Cabinet, he thought his best course was to go.The Secretary of State for .var suggested that the Cabinet might give that advice.The Secretary of State for India demurred to tnis. The King must abdicate voluntarily .Tne Pri;r.e Minister said tnat tne onl, formal advice the King had received was that a &quot;morganatic&quot; marriage was impracticable.Tne Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the King would announce first to the Cabinet nis intention to abdicate.-12-
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said he felt a great deal of sympathy with the position of the King.   He thought that the Cabinet should leuve open the possibility of a broadcast on some future more appropriate occasion, but not couple it with the advice now being given.    The Cabinet should not make any suggestion at the moment that the Dominion Governments would agree later on to a broadcast but they ought to get in touch with the Dominions on the question.    In reply to the Prime Minister he adued that he thought he could get an answer on this particular broadcast from the Dominions by tomorrow night. He agreed that, in the circumstances, it would be best to advise the King not to make the broadcast and to explain by telegram to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions the circumstances in which it had been unavoidable to take this action.The Home Secretary said that the dividing line was what could be done by a man who was King .^nd by a man who was not King.The First Lord of the Admiralty said he would be quite satisfied with action on these lines.    He thought the King should be given a written statement as this would safeguard the position of the Government in the House of Commons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with the Home Secretary that the statement might begin by making a distinction between a man who was King und any other highly placed individual.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thought it possible that the King who was generously minded might-13-
turn right round and decide to do all he could for his successor.The Minister of Health thought that for the moment the right course was to confine the Cabinet&apos;s adwioe to the present broadcast.The Horns Secretary adhered to his previous attitude.    He thought that even an expression by the King of a wish for his brother&apos;s success involved the sanction of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister agreed in principle with the First Lord that it was desirable to keep in mind the possibility of a later broadcast, but he also agreed in principle thut this was not the ri, ht moment to raise the mutter.The Horns Secretary assumed that the Prims Minister would give the King a written document giving the results of the Cabinet&apos;s deliberations.The Prime Minister agreed.   He was anxious not to be constantly running to and fro between the King and the Cabinet as this gave a bad public impression. He, therefore, wanted to send a document in which the Cabinet would be baBed on the rock bottom of constitutional principle.   He thought that he ought also to consult the Leaders of the Opposition, both Labour and Liberal.    If he himself were in Opposition he would think he had a right to be consulted. In reply to a question as to whether the Leader of the Opposition Liberals supported the attitude of the News Chronicle he replied that the Leader was not a person who made very definite statements and he did not know his exact position.    He had seemed to agree-14-
with the Prime Minister when he talked.The Minister of Health asked whether, after this communication had been made in writing, the Prime Minister intended to bring matters to an issue this weekend.The Chancellor of the Exchequer (who had been called out of the Cabinet Meeting for a few minutes and had returned) said he had learnt from the Chief whip that Mr. Winston Churchill and Lord Beaverbrook were in close consultation and were working together on the lines adopted by the Daily Mail, the Daily Express and the News Chronicle.    This confirmed his own view that the Prime Minister ought to insist that the King should take his decision this weekend.   Either he should give up hie proposed marriage or marry the lady and abdicate. Otherwise the whole matter might blow up very seriously and split the Empire in two.   No one could tell where it would end.   He thought, then, that the Prime Minister should bring His Majesty sharply up to the point that he must take his decision that very day.The Lord Privy beal added the suggestion that His Majesty should be told that if he did not take hie decision the Government would resign.The Minister of Transport observed that if the King did not go through with his broadcast he might achieve the same result Borne other way.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the King must be advised by some irresponsible people that he could get away with it.   In the interests of the Country and of the Empire it was impoesible to delay any longer.-15-
The Minister for Co-Ordinution of Defence agreed. If the issue was not faced now there was a danger of the King leaYing the Country which would bring us buck to the position of 1688.The Prime Minister said that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury had been invited to lunch with Mr. Winston Churchill and he had advised him to go.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury had received a private message from a well-informed person who said that the Cabinet should play all their cards now.The Home Secretary pointed out that the only reference in the Press to the possibility of a broadcast had been in the News Chronicle.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the very sound leading article in the Daily Herald.The Minister of Health thought it probable that the Evening Papers would follow the News Chronicle&apos;s announcement by urging that the King ought to take the people into his confluence.   The matter could not be allowed to stand over until Monday.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that if the Cabinet insisted on the King making up his mind today and to threaten resignation if he did not do so, they might also telegraph to the Dominions and suggest that they 6hould suggest their views to the King on the question of urgency.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested that the Cabinet&apos;s reasons for urgency should be given but that the Dominions should not be asked to take corresponding action.The Secretary of State for jtominion Affairs agreed that unless a decision could be obtained by-16-
midnight this question would be seething in the next forty-eight hours.   The Cabinet should ask for a decision by midnight and tell the House of Commons their decision on the morrow.The Minister of Health insisted that an announcement must be made to the House of Commons before the weekend.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested the possibility that the King*B decision might be tukon in time for an announcement that very day.The Lord President pointed out that the House of Commons would adjourn 6harp on 4 p.m. without the question being put.    It was by no means unlikely that since the House of Commons was much preoccupied with the Constitutional Question the Debute on the Private Member&apos;s Bill might peter out.The Prime Minister thought there was a certain degree of danger in keeping the House of Commons in session until tomorrow without having anything to say to them,   lie did not want to put a pistol at the head of the King in this matter.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence said hie proposal was that the Cabinet should ue alive to the necessity of having to make a statement on the morrow.The Secretary of State for Air asked what the position would be if by tomorrow the King had not made up his mind.The Minister of Health said that even in that event the Prime Minis tei&apos; must make some statement.The Secretary of State for India said that by midnight, if no reply had been received, the Cabinet would resign.-17-
The Minister of Transport asked the Cabinet to consider the terrible possible consequences to that position.   Mr. Churchill might be sent for and might form a Government and then demand a General Election.The Home Secretary thought that if the House of Commons adjourned until tomorrow the Prime Minister would, at any rate, be in a position to make some statement then, for example, he might Bay that a morganatic marriage involved legislation in all the Dominions and that the Government were satisfied that this could not be ob&apos;ained either here or in the Dominions.   At the moment most people did not understand the impossibility of such legislation ana the HouBe of Commons ought to be told the position, which came down to this, that Mrs. Simpson could only marry the King if she was either to be Queen or a private person.The President of the Board of Trade urged that the latter statement should be made that very afternoon.The Minister of Health pointed out that that would have the advantage of giving the King a little more time.The President of the Board of Trade said that a great advantage would be surrendered if the statement was not made the same afternoon.The Minister of Health also urged an immediate statement which avoided pushing the King too hard.The Secretary of State for War agreed that a statement Bhoulu be made as suggested by the president of the Board of Trade that very afternoon.   This would give the Nation something to ponder over during the weekend, after which a further statement would have to be made.   The uovei&apos;nnient could then not be accused of having ruohed the King.-18-
The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported thisidea.The First Commissioner of Works also supported thic plan.   The Government could not control the Sunday Press and it was important ut any rate to give them this much.(The Prime Minister sent for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury).The Minister of Education asked how much the Prime Minister would he entitled to say seeing that hie interviews with the King had been of rather a private character.     The King&apos;s statement at the first interview of his intention to abdicate was a matter of great importance.    It had been made spontaneously and not in reply to a question.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Kinghad said the same thing to him.(The Cabinet were informed that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury had left for the Travellers Club).The Minister of Transport said that if the Government were to resign before the weekend, the King might be able to obtain other Ministers who would advise him to go on with his course.The Prime Minister said that if he was to make a statement that afternoon, he would have to tell the King first.The President of the Board of Trade urged that the advantages of an immediate statement were overwhelming.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed.   It would get the Cabinet out of the objection of having to ask for a reply by midnight on the morrow and enable them to give the King until Sunday night.-19-
The Home Secretary agreed that it would haveevery advantage.   The statement would get broadcastthat evening and there would be time to obtain thereaction from the Dominions before Sunday. It would also enable the Government to get the positionclearly to the public and the Empire that Mrs. Simpsoncould only become the wife either of the King or ofa private person who had been King.The Secretary of State for War pointed out alsothat in making a statement of this kind no confidenceswere involved.(Sir George Penny, one of the Government Whips entered at this point and Bald that there was no difficulty in keeping the House together until the afternoon.   He then withdrew).The Home Secretary pointed out that the Important statement it wae proposed to make today would dispose of the difficulty raised by certain newspapers.The Prime Minister asked if what was contemplated was a Btatenent or a speech.The Home Secretary suggested that arrangements might be made to adjourn the house shortly before 4 p.m. when the Prime Minister could make a statement in reply to a question by the Leader of the Opposition. There would then be no debate and the statement would be so timed a8 not to give opportunity for it.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said he he had not considered how much could be said in the statement without Dominions opinion. The conBultutionB had been personal between the Prime Minister and the Prime Ministers of the Dominions.-20-
It would hardly be possible to obtain the consent of the Prime Ministers of the Dominions before 3.45 p.m. Those were strong arguments against the statement being made. On the other hand, the circumstances were very exceptional. He felt sure that the support of the Dominion Prime Ministers could be obtained for anything that Mr.Baldwin considered essential.   We knew also their general attitude.    If the Cabinet thought, that the reasonB in favour of a statement sufficient he would take the responsibility of a statement being m\de and explain the matter to the Dominions in a telegram.The Hone Secretary thought that no very definite statement need be made about the precise attitude of the Dominions.The Minister of Education and the Minister of Health thought that the whole velue of the statement would be lest without a description of the attitude of the Dominions.The Hone Secretary thought that the reference to the Dominions might be worded carefully without going too far.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that the Dominion Prime Ministers were willing to back the Prime Minister in what he thought necessary. The Cabinet might therefore take the responsibility of referring to them.The Home Secretary still thought that not so very much need be said about the Dominions.   The Prime Minister might say in effect that such legislation was unthinkable in this Parliament;analso that legislation would be required in the Dominion Parliaments.-21-
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that a colleague had suggested telephoning to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions.   There was a good deal of risk of leakage in this course.   It would he awkward also if some Dominion Prime Ministers said they would rather not he quoted.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in that event they would not be mentioned specifically.The Minister of Education pointed out that even if one Dominion wae unwilling to accede, it would be a sufficient bar.The Prime Minister saw scire risk in starting in three hours* time  to make a statement without an adequate opportunity to think the whole matter over.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that one of the advantages of acting today xvas that there would be no debate.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it possible that the Frime Mlniater might 6ay that he was satisfied from inquiries that in no Dominion was legislation to render possible a morganatic marriage practicable.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence suggested the phrase *I have no reason to doubt&quot;.The Home Secretary said he would not propose necessarily to mention a morganatic marriage.   He would say that this was a matter on which the House of Commons was entitled to be informed since it had already been discussed in the Press but there was no doubt that if the King married his wife could have no other status than that of Queen.    If it was thought that this difficulty could be got over by legislation he must point out that it would require legislation not only in this Country but alBO in the Dominions. This-22-
was a natter for the Government here to consider. How could anyone think it possible?   The legislation would have to be applied to a particular individual.   When was the legislation to take place, before or after the marriage?   Viae trie King&apos;s wife to be degraded after marriage.    If the case of the Prince Consort was raised, it could be pointed out that the position of a marriage of a King and of a ^ueen was quite different and that a Queen could marry without the Prince Consort becoming King, as in the case of Queen Victoria.   He added shortly after that one of the advantages of making a statement now was that it dealt effectively with the issue raised in the King&apos;s proposed broadcast.Thic was agreed to be a most important point.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that the Chancellor of the Kxchequer&apos;s reference to the Dominions would give us the necessary support from the DominionB and meet his difficulties.The Secretary of Utate for India asked what would be the effect of a statement this afternoon on the date date as to when the King&apos;s decision on his marriage was to be asked for.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested Sunday night or Monday morning.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it should not be delayed so long.   The King would be told by the Prime Minister that he was going to make a statement as to the possibility of a morganatic marriage. That made it impoaBible to carry on without a decision. He would like to ask for a decision by Saturday evening.-23-
In reply to the Secretary of State for Scotland he added that if the King had not taken his decision by then it did not mean that the resignation of the Cabinet need take effect at once.Tho Home Secretary said that however the matter was dealt with action would not be possible unless a document was prepared and the Oovernnent was in a position in which it could get a document signed by the King by Monday at, say, 10.30 a.m.The First Commissioner of &apos;.forks said this meant that tho Xing ought to give his decision at the latest by Saturday night.The Prima Minister asked the Cabinet to stand by continuously in ctiae a meeting was required.
appendix i. NOTE.1. It is a fundamental constitutional principle that the King&apos;s Ministers must take responsibility for every public act of the &apos;ring, for the King himself can do no wrong;    and it follows as a necessary corollary that Ministers must have the right to tender advice before the act is done.    This principle is the basis of constitutional monarchy and if the King disregarded it, the monarchy would cease to be constitutional.2. Accordingly,  it would be a grave breach of constitutional principle if the Sovereign were to makea public statement on any matter of public interest except on the advice of his Ministers.    Whether the medium is the B.B.C.  or any other form of address sooken or written makes no difference.    This extends even to replies to loyal addresses presented by Municipal bodies - a fortiori to a world-wide discourse which manifestly might have constitutional consequences.3. Apparent exceptions to the rule that the King&apos;s public utterances must be such as are approved by his Ministers (such as King George&apos;s Christmas message) are not really exceptions at all.    In such cases Ministers are willing to give an experienced Monarch who thoroughly understands and has always strictly observed constitutional limitations, a discretion as to whathe would say, and are content to take full responsibility knowing well that the Monarch will say nothing of which Kis Ministers would not approve.4. The King is bound to accept and act upon the advice of his Ministers in this connection.    For the King to broadcast in disregard of that advice would be appealing over the heads of His constitutional advisers.-i -
5. There is a further orinciole involved. The constitutional duty of the King is not to taice 3ides in any matter of public controversy.    If he does so on Ministers&apos; advice, of course they alone are responsible; but if he does so without their advice,  or in defiance of it, he ceases to act as a constitutional Monarchand his intervention is calculated to divide His subjects into opposing camos.    It is manifest that the King&apos;s broadcast must have this result.6. Moreover,  a Royal broadcast of the nature contemplated could only be given on the advice of all the King&apos;s Governments.    Even if there were a change of government in this country, and new Ministers could be found &quot;oreoared to authorise such a proceeding, this would avail nothing unless all the Dominion Governments also aooroved the oroject.
fOPPFTDTX IT.By ancient custom, The Xing addresses his public utterances to his people.    Tonight I am going to talk to you as my friends - British men and women wherever you may reside, within or without the Empire.The last time I broadcast to you all, on Saint David&apos;s Day, I told you that you had known me better as The Prince of Wales.    I am still that same man whose motto was &quot;Ich Dien,&quot; &quot;I Serve&quot;;    and I   have tried to serve this country and the Empire for the last twenty years.    And tonight I am not forgetting the great Dominions and Dependencies beyond the seas, who have always shown me such ooen-hearted kindness.Now I realize that the newsoaoers of other countries have given you full cause for speculation as to what I am going to do - as to what is going to haooen.    And I want here to exoress my gratitude to the newspapers of Great Britain for the courtesy and consideration thsy have shown.It was never mj; intention to hide anything from you.    Hitherto it has not been possible for me to speak, but now I must.I could not go on bearing the heavy   burdens that constantly rest on me as King, unless I could be strengthened in the task by a happy married life; and so I am firmly resolved to marry the woman I love, when she is free to marry me.You know me well enough to understand that I never could have contemplated a marriage of convenience. It has taken me a long time to find the woman I want to make my wife.    Without her I have been a very lonely man.    With her I shall have a home and all the-1-
companionship and mutual sympathy and understanding which married life can bring,    I know that many of you have had the good fortune to be blessed with such a life, and I am sure that in your hearts you   would wish the same for me.Neither Mrs.  Simpson nor I, have ever sought to insist that she should be Queen*    All we desired was that our married haooiness should carry with it a proper title and Oignity for her, befitting my wife.Nov/ that I have at last been able to take you so fully into my confidence,  I feel it is best to go away for awhile, so that you may reflect calmly and quietly, but without undue delay, on whnt I have said. Nothing is nearer to my heart than that I should return; but whatever may befall, I sholl always have a deep affection for my Country, for the Empire, and for you all.
