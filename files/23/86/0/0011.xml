THE FIVE-POWER CONFERENCE.(Previous Reference:-Ca.binet 67 (36), Conclusion 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that at the end of the previous week he had held several conversations with M. Van Zeeland, the Prime Minister of Belgium.    The results were incorporated in a document which he was about to circulate.    He would prefer to leave any discussion until the next weekly Meeting of the Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary added that he had received information that in the Debate on Foreign Affairs in the French Chamber next Friday either the President of the Council or the Minister for Foreign Affairs would refer to the Secretary of State&apos;s own statement of our guarantee to go to the assistance of France or Belgium in the case of unprovoked aggression and woula make a reciprocal announcement that Franc? would be prepared to come to our assistance in the case of an unprovoked aggression against us.
i THE SITUATION I. SPAIN.I .Previous 11 Reference: I   Cabinet 67 I   (36), Con-|   elusion 2.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the French Ambassador had aporoached him with a suggestion of some international initiative being taken in an attempt to put an end to the fighting in Spain.    The idea was to approach the Governments of Germany, Italy, Russia and Portugal with a view to mediation if a favourable moment presented itself.    The co-operation of the United States of America would also be sought.    He felt no great hope of success, but the French Goverrment appeared to think that as the war was not going very well for General Franco, the Dictator&apos; Powers might be glad of an opportunity to bring the war to an end. Even in that event, however, there would remain the difficulties in Spain itself, which were very great. Even if&apos; intervention failed it might tend to induce a quieter atmosphere and leave the Spaniards with tne hope that intervention would be available later on. The French Government rather hoped that the attempt would be made dur i g the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations.    Owinr to its limited membership the League was not in a position to intervene itself, but it might commend the negotiations. In reply to a question the Secretary of State added that telegrams had been received confirming the news that some 5,000 Germans had arrived in the South of Spain.The Secretary of State for Air said that for a long time past German aeroplanes had been used by General Franco&apos;s army, and it was known that they were being maintained by German personnel. The latest information looked like an intensification of this action.-2-
A short discussion took place on the proposal for intervention.    No very optimistic views were held as to the prospects, hut it was generally agreed that the approach should he made.    It was   possible that the Dictator Powers, even if unwilling1 to intervene themselves, might be willing to see an attempt made by others.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to associate himself with the French Government in their efforts to bring about mediation in Spain..
SPAIN.International Relief.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had seen the British representative on the International Relief Committee, who was willing to see if anything could he done to afford relief to Spain.The Lord President of the Council informed the Cabinet that he had reason to believe that a sum of over  2,100 had been colleotea as the result of a recent Albert Hall meeting, and that possibly this might b&apos;2 obtained for purposes of relief, which would at any rate divert it from being spent on armamentsThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought it probable that the International Relief Committee would make an appeal for subscriptions, and this would give the custodians of the Albert Hall collection an opportunity to make a subscription.
SPAIN,Shipment of Lorries.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 67 (36), Conclusion 2. )4. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that, two British ships were on their way to Spain, one from this country and one from Odessa, with cargoes of motor lorries.    The ship from Odessa carried 09 motor lorries and no other cargo, and was at this moment detained at Malta.    Motor lorries were not included in the list of prohibited articles set forth in the Order in Council, and could not legally be held up. On the other hand, General Franco might instruct his ships to treat them as munitions of war.   He asked whether motor lorries ought to be put on the prohibited list.The Cabinet were reminded that the object of their policy was to avoid an incident on the high seas. It could hardly be argued that the Russian Government were sending lorries merely to stimulate trade.On the other hand it was suggested that lorries might well be represented as being required for the evacuation of Madrid by the civil population.    It was reoalled also that there were many other articles on the borderline between munitions of war and civilian requirements.    It would be very difficult to extend the existing list, which had been drawn up by the International Committee on Non-Intervention. The passage of the Bill through Parliament had not been easy, and addition to the list would certainly oreate difficulties.The First Lord of the Admiralty -pointed o*t that, tyhc uaual praotioo in cajiMt wiv i&apos;&quot;  a British ship conveying to Spain a cargo that did not include articles on the prohibited 1 is\Lmwenr-fre* viva i , ,an oeoor-t  Ho aokod if tho Adr.iiralt.y wore fcc escort a hip      j l&apos;!&apos;f ilJfc lUllLLLJ.On the whole, this course was thought to be undesirable.    It was hardly possible to escort every ship, and it was s^gpested that ships in this position-5-
should he allowed to proceed unescorted, but that if they were stopped, and communicated by wireless, a British ship should be sent to investigate. The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the list of munitions of war shoula not be altered, and that no action should be taken to include lorries in it:(b) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should Inform the Governor of Malta that the ship detained there should be allowed to sail:(c) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should   inform the Mival Commander-in-Chief that it was unnecessary for him to escort the ship in question, but that if she should be detained by one of General Franco&apos;s Cruisers a British ship should investigate.
ITALY.Relations with.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 66 (36), Conclusion 5. )5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs leported that he had sent detailed instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome tor his conversations with a view to an improvement in Anglo-Italian relations.    These would be circulated among the Foreign Office Telegrams at once.
IRAQ.The Assyrians.I (Previous Reference: Cabinet 62 (36), Conclusion 6.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssaid he was still a good deal preoocupied about theposition of the Assyrians in Iraq.    If somethingwas not done we might, before long, reach a situationof great difficulty.   We had a certain obligation tothese people, who had rerh.ered us services in theWar and had proved themselves to have good fighting-qualities.In reply to suggestions that a homemight be found for the Assyrians in the ColonialEmpire, the Secretary of State for the Coloniessaid that the Governor of Cyprus had been consultedas to the possibility of absorbing them in thatIsland, but had reported the exist ence of manydifficulties.    There was no Government land, theIsland was poor, and there was a shortage of roadsand water.    To plant uhe Assyrians there wouldinvolve nationalising land and creating greatdifficulties for an Island where the politicalalready situation was/far from easy.The Cabinet recognised the gravity of the situation which would arise if the Assyrians in Iraq were exposed to further assaults.    They were reminded that a plateau in British Guiana had been surveyed but that the League of Nations Committee had rejected the proposal.    A course which it was thought should be further explored was the possibility oi utilising these people, as they had been utilised before, for military purposes, with a vie&apos;v&apos; to relieving British troops in the Colonies. The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for War should arrange f&gt;r the question to be further&apos; considered, in the light of tba above discussion, by the irrespective Departments, with a   view to a report to the Cabinet.-8-
RECRUITING FOR THE ARMY.(PreviousIReference: Cabinet 60 (36), Conclusion 9. )7. The Cabinet, had before theiu the followingdocuments on the subject of Recruiting for the Army:-A Memorandum by the Secretaiy of State for War (C.P.-322 (36)) drawing attention to the difficulties of the problem and proposing a number of reforms which the Army Council considered to constitute the ndnimum calculated to bring the W Eritish Army up to strength:A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India (CP.-323 (36)) explaining the position   of Itdia in relation to the financial and political aspects of the proposals contained in CP.-322 (36):A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (CP.-327 (36)) commenting on some of the Secretaiy of State for Wai1s proposals in the light of the knowledge of the labour situation possessed by his Department, and suggesting finally that a small Committee of the Cabinet should be set up forthwith to examine into the causes of the comparative failure to secur  recruits for the Army and to make recommendations as to the steps necessary to remove them.The Secretary of State for War developed at somelength the case put forward in his Memorandum, andasked, as a natter of urgency, for decisions on anumber of the suggestions contained th-rein, namely,the adoption of a blue uniform;   vocational training(a decision in principle that vocational trainingshould be available to men of good character whodesired it, but details to be worked out with theMinistry or Labour); a free kit to every recruit,inducing the provision of helmets when soldiers goto India;   four meals a day for the Army, thus bringingthem into line with the Navy;   on the amenitiesthein paragraph 44; and / appointment of a Committee to consider whether the Civil Service could not give more employment to ex-Service men, and to report on the system under which, when an ex-soldier joins the Civil Service, his years of service in the Army do not count towards pension.-9-
The Chancellor or the Exchequer, while appreciating: the seriousness of the situation and sympathising with the Secretary of State for War, said that as yet there was no agreement &quot;between the War Office and the Treasury.    The War Office had not been willing to allow fresh proposals to be raised in the conversations which had taken place.    The Treasury had had to ascertain the reactions which the War Office proposals would have on the Navy and Air Force, which, in soma of the items, added enormously to the expenditure involved. This accounted for the delay that had taken place. He thought it impossible that the Cabinet could take decisions at th t Meeting or without further exploration either between the Treasury and the Service Departments or by a Cabinet Committee.The Secretary of State for IixLia explained fully to the Cabinet the political and financial reasons wh. the proposals were impossible of acceptance by India, who was asked to incur what -was, for her, a very heavy military expenditure for the benefit of the Army at home.The Minister of Labour explained the position of his Department on this subject, on the lines of his Memorandum.The Minister for Co ordination of Defence thought that there were other matters which ought to be considered at the same time as the proposals before the Cabinet.    For example, in some cases the recruiting arrangements were most unsatisfactory:    in Liverpool, for instance, where the recruiting stations of the three Services were widely separated and the army recruiting station was in a particularly bad condition.    He had heard that the medical tests, particularly as regards eyes and teeth, were out of date.    The tests applied to a private soldier were double those of an Officer,-10-
because the latter &apos;as allowed to weai glasses and the former was not.    There was also a difference in the way the General Post Of1 ices treated applicants for employment from the Labour Centres and the Military Centres   the latter being put to seiious disadvantage.    None of these points required nhney and they might make a great difference.There was general agreement that the whole subject required fuller exploration before it was ready for decisions by the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Comimittee, composed as follows  The First Commissioner of Works(in the Chair), The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The Secretary of Stat&quot;3 for war, The Secretary of State for Air, The Secretary of State 101 India, The First Lord of the Admiralty, The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, The Minister oi Health, The Minister oi Labour  should give consideration to the question of Army Recruiting in the light ol the Memoranda prepared for consideretion by the Cabinet (CP.-322 (36), CP.-323 (36) and C P.-327 (36)) and of the Cabinet discussion, and report their proposals to the Cabinet if possible in time for a decision to be taken before Christmas.
LOCATION OP GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 56 (35) Conclusion 7.)8.     The Cabinet had before them a Most Secret Note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-320 (36)) circulating a Report by the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Location of Government Departments in Time of War.     The Report had been brought direct to the Cabinet as a matter of urgency for the reason that it included a recommendation for abandoning the new Government Building in Whitehall.The Cabinet did not have time to discuss the proposals as a whole.     They were informed, however, that several Ministers had strong criticisms of the proposal to abandon the new Government Building in Whitehall.The First Commissioner of Works stated that he could not hold up proceeding   with the building for long, as the lease of the Air Ministry would expire in 1939 and he had no other suitable accommodation for them.The Cabinet agreed:(a) Without prejudice to the ultimatedecision, that the First Commissioner of Works should suspend,fcr the present, proceeding with the new Government Building in Whitehall, except for the contract for the diversion of the main sewer.(b) That the subject should be furtherconsidered at the next weekly Meeting of the Cabinet.
THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY BILL.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 60 (36), Conclusion 10. )9.    The Cabinet had under coiisideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (H.A.-39(36)) covering the draft Livestock Industry Bill, theprincipal objects of which were the establishment of aLivestock Commission;   the establishment of anaugrnentive Cattle Fund with provision for the paymenttherefrom of a subsidy to producers of fat cattle;the regulation of the importation of livestock andmeat;   the improvement of the system of livestockmarkets;   the setting up of not more than three localexperiments in centralised slaughtering;   and thepromotion by the industry of its own commercialdevelopment and technical proficiency through servicessuch as advertising and the encouragement of educationand research.The conclusions reached by the Committee of HomeAffairs thereon (H.A.C.  12th Conclusions (36),Minute l) were as follows:-&quot;(i) To invite the Home Secretary and the Attorney-General to assist, so far as might be found necessary, the Minister.&apos; of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland, in dealing With the various outstanding points to which reference had been made in the course of the discussion:(ii) To recommend the Cabinet to authorisethe introduction in the House of Commons of the Livestock Industry Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-39 (36), Subject to the settlement of the various   outstanding points to which reference had been made at the Meeting, and subject also to any drafting or other minor alterations that might be founa necessary or desirable.&quot;After the Home Secretary had made astatement on the subject, the Cabinet agreed:To approve the conclusions of the . Committee of Home Affairs as set forth above.
THE BEEF AND VEAL CUSTOMS DUTIES BILL.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 60 (36), Conclusion 10.)10.   The O&amp;biaet had before them a Memorandum bythe Financial Secretary to the Treasury (H.A.-40 (36))covering the draft Beef and Veal Customs Duties Bill,the effect of which would be that duties of, or nearlyequivalent to, 20 per cent, ad valorem would becharged on all imported beef and veal (other thanEmpire products), with two exceptions.    The rates tobe charged were the highest which could be imposed inconform:ty with the new Trade Agreement with ArgentinaThe conclusions reaohed thereon by the Committeeof Home Affairs (H.A.C. 12th Conclusions (36),Minute 2) were as follows:-&quot;(i) To invite the Home Secretary and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to consult the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury regarding the possibility of the Beef and Veal Customs Duties Bill being passed into law before the Christmas Recess, pointing cut tne advantages of this course ever the alternative procedure of collecting the duty under a ways and Means Resolution:(ii) To recommend the Cabinet to authorise the intrcauotion of the Eill forthwith in the House of Cohmcns in the form ^f the draft annexed to H.A.-40 (36), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirableh.With reference to conclusion (i) of theCommittee &lt; f Home Affairs, the Home Secretary saidthat the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurytook the view that it was not possible to get theBeef and Veal Customs Duties Bill throughParliament before the recess.     Although therewere disadvantages in the alternative of proceedingunder a Ways and Means Resolution, there appeared- 14 -
to &quot;be no alternative &quot;but to adopt thiB procedure and to introduce the Bill in the New Year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer Informed the Cabinet that there were some difficulties in the Bill in connection with the Polish Agreement. Under that Agreement not more than 10 per cent, duty could be placed upon oanned tongues up Mo JBtM amount of  500 a ;ysag as compared with 30 per cent, allowed in the Bill.     This would involve rather awkward explanations in Parliament.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To authorise the introduction ofthe Bill after the recess in the House of Commons in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.40 (36), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable.(b) In the meanwhile to proceed undera Ways and Means Resolution in the House of Commons.
THE MARRIAGE BILL.(Previous Reference: Cabinet 66 (36), Conclusion 12. )11.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP.-329 (36)) stating that the Attorney-General, who would be assisting the Standing Committee on the Marriage Bill on the following day in accordance with the Conclusion referred to in the margin, had pointed out that it would hardly be possible i&apos;or him to abstain from indicating a personal view on some of the questions which would arise, and that there were other matters on which a personal view from the Attorney-General woold certainly be expected.    The Home Secretary suggested that the Cabinet should authorise the Attorney-General to express, where necessary, his personal view on points as they arose, making it clear that he was not stating any Government conclusions but merely assisting the Committee to reach a conclusion as to the best form in which the proposals should be embodied.He also suggested that the Attorney-General shouldotherbe placed in the same position as/Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet and should be permitted to vote on the Bill.In the course of a short discussion, it became clear that the general view of the Cabinet was that the Attorney-General should avoid expressing his personal view on the points that arose and should content himself with explaining the consequences which would arise on one side or the other from the proposals in the Bill.The Home Secretary withdrew his proposal that the Attorney-General should be authorised to vote on the Bill.The Cabinet agreed:That the Home Secretary should inform the Attorney-General of their views as summarised above.- 16 -
THE OFFICESREGULATIONBILL-(Previous Reference: Cabinet 67 (36), Con-12. The Cabinet had under oonsideration the Offioes Regulation Bill, introduced by a Private Member and down for Second Reading in the House of Commons on Friday, December 4th.The Minister of Health suggested that this Bill should be dealt with by the Government spokesman as on previous occasions by offering opposition to the proposals to put more onerous requirements on to the occupants of offices. &apos;The Cabinet agreed:That the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Home Office, should deal with this Bill on behalf of the Government on the lines suggested by the Minister of Health to whom he   oould apply for a brief on the subject.
(he journalists Ministration) ill. Previous Reference: Cabinet G7 (36), Conclusion 12. )13. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council (C.P.-321 (36)) drawing the attention of his colleagues to a provision in theB Journalists (Registration) Bill (introduced by a 1 Private Member and the Second Order in the House of Commons on Friday, December 4th), under which all Regulations made by the proposed Journalists Registration Council would require the approval of the Privy Council.    His suggestion was thnt the Regulations of the proposed Journalists Registration Council could appropriately be approved by a Department other than the Privy Council.After the Lord President of the Council had nade a statement on the lines of his memorandum, a short discussion took place.The Home Secretary said that the Bill was not likely to obtain a Second Reading as it was the second of the Bills down for consideration and was opposed by the National Union of Journalists.The Cabinet agreed:That the Home Secretary should be responsible for the Government&apos;s attitude on the Bill and should take into account the Lord President&apos;s objections. &gt; Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.  4 December, 1936.
