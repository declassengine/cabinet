  KING&apos;SKtsntion  MARRY. previousReference:  jabinet 70 (36)  Conclusion 2.)The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet an account of his audience with the King on the previous afternoon at Port Belvedere and added that, at the King&apos;s request, he was to see His Majesty again the same afternoon.The King had expressed a willin0ness to inform the Prime Minister of his decision as soon as possible, but the Prime Minister did not expect a final decision that afternoon.The object of the fresh audience was to submit to the King the Cabinet&apos;s view as to the nature of the statement in Parliament which His Majesty would like him to make on Monday.During the discussion, the Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter from Mr. Winston Churchill, which had been placed in his hands while the Cabinet was sitting.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That in any statement made inParliament as to the King&apos;s views, the considerations set forth in the Prime Minister&apos;s submission to the King of the 4th December (Cabinet 70 (36) Appendix I) would apply.(b) That the Prime Minister shouldbe asked to express to the King the view of the Cabinet that if it was impossible for the King&apos;s decision to be announced before Monday, the state of public opinion was such that some statement would have to be made in Parliament.(c) That the Prime Minister and suchof his colleagues as he might wish to consult should at once draw up the general lines of a statement which should include an appropriate reference to the communications that had taken place with the Dominions.(d) To meet on Monday, the 7th December,at 10.30 a.m.- 1 -
(e)   That members of the Cabinet should remain within an hour&apos;s journey of London between Saturday und Monday and should give their addresses to the Secretary in case an emergency meeting should be necessary.  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. Imh December, 1936.
The Prime Minister said he wished tne present Meeting to be as short as possible, partly because he had to see Mr Monckton daring tne morning end he had certain matters to discus* with some of his colleagues who had been helping him;   also because he wished to avoid any appearance, of a crisis wnioh did not exist at the moment.   He did not anticipate it would be necessary to hold another Meeting ttiat lay, nor, probably, tomorrow Continuing   the Prime Minister said tnat he had seen ! the King on the previous evening.   At tne King&apos;s request Mr Monckton had been present.   Mr Monokton and Mr Allen, the King&apos;s Solicitor, had convinced riis Majesty as to the constitutional impropriety of a broadcast address. The Prime Minister had given the King tne pertinent parts of the memorandum drawn up on txxe previous day. The King had been calmer than at nie previous interview, and ne had nimself felt that possibly he nad made up his mind.   He had then told tne King of tne reasons for urgency in this matter, and had begged him to reach a decision at the earliest possible moment, t no ugh ne n*&gt;d not in any way put   pistol at hie head.   He had rather put the King on his nonour .to let mm know nis decision as soon as possible.   The King had agreed, and promised to do this.   He was to see tne King again the same afternoon.The King had expressed a &gt;.isn that the Prime Minister should make a statement in Parliament on Mond y afternoon in the course of which he wanted him to say, fir t, tnat the King had decided to hhtTj Mrs Simpson, and. set,orid, tnat ne hud wanted to announce it on tne broadcast himself.   There were difficulties in tne wa^ of this, but tne Prime Minister had promised to consider it, and Mr konukton was coming to discuss tne matter witn nim tnat morninc.
The Kinr had then asked if the Prime Minister would object to his seeing Mr *Yinaton Churchill, and he had agreel   though he now felt ao:.e misgivings on tne subject*   He himself felt i very great sympathy for tne King in his difficult predicament.   He had explained tnat he had no friends to discuss the matter with,   &quot;he only people he had wanted to see were Mr .Vina ton Charahill and Lord Derby.   He had not sent for Lord Derby, but had explained to the Prime Minister that Mr Winston Churchill had known him from his boyhood and had always been moat friendly.   He himaelf had felt tnat ne muat bear in mind the difficult poeition of the King, faced with the serried rank8 of the Cabinet and Parliament and without anyone with whom to diacuas tne matter. The Prime Mixiister&apos;a visit tne aumc afternoon waa being made at the King&apos;s request, and it would p.ive him an opportunity to correct any undeairable advice wuich Mr Churcnill might offer.   The King had aaid tnat he had no Opinion of Mr tflneton Churchill* a judgment. He waa aeeing another politician.   Hia kajeaty nad added that from the first he had wanted tne whole busineap to be conducted between the Prime ttiriieter and himself.   He had gone on to eay *I nave never let you down, have I?&quot;   The Prime Minister might nave toi;remind him of thst, especially if he agreed to something which did not meet with the approval of the Cabinet. Mr Monckton had afterward expressed the view that tnt Prime Minister had been wise in agreeing to Mr Churchill&apos;s visit.The Lord President of the Council, aa the Prime Minister&apos;a predecessor in office, aaid ne doubted if it waa a mistake to ^ive tula consent,   &quot;&apos;he only thing he would add wae &quot;No aecond interview&quot;.
The Prime Minister said that If he had been trying to yut yrespure on the King to leave the Throne it would be a different matter, but that all nis effort* were being directed towards an act of free will by the King.The First Lord of the Admiralty said the greatest risk was that tne King might ask Mr Cnarcnill to work with Mr fconckton.The Home Secretary and the minister for Agriculture and Pis lit; ries, who *new fctr Mo.ncitton well, felt aure that, while ne was doing his utmost to nely the King in a yroyer manner, he would not agree to work witn Mr Churchill.The Cnaucellor of tne Exchequer suggested tnat the yoextion now was that the Government could hardly make a statement on Monday The Prime Minister doubted this,   T&apos;aere was the question of the commoni oat ions witn the Dominions, on which Parliament ought to be enlightened as soon as practicable,   tfhile the Cabinet was assembling ne had asked the Secretary of Ctat&lt;- for Dominion Affairs to cone ider tnis .The Secretary of State for tae Colonies considered tnat a statement on Monday was vital.The Prime Minister, in reyly to a question, said that he was not exyeeting to reoeive the King&apos;s decision at his Interview that day, but rat ner to disease *itu him the nature of the statement he could maxe on Monday   if a statement could be made.The President of tne Board of Sducation ayyrehcnded that people might be saying tnat the Cabinet were putting pressure on the King.    . o ..i&quot; it not be yosslble, ne asked, to include in any statement in Parliament tne fact tnat the King had never syoken of making Mrs Simpson Queen?   It would be useful to say that before tne King announces nis ov n decision.-3.-
Suggestions were then made by several Miniotera to the effect tnat Mr Churchill might advise the King to do nothing:   to adopt the position tnat, as Mrs ^im#aoa was not at present free and no marriage coald take plaae, he would announce no decision.    It was stated that tne &apos;Daily Herald&quot; reported that to be the view of ms unofficial advisers at the moment.The Home Secretary thought that there was a basis for advice to the King on tnat footing.The Prime Minister thought that the present position was that the King was cot.8 ldering tne right moment for him to renounce the Throne.   Ho might be able to clear the matter up to aosme extent t;iat afterrvoon.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tnought there were obvious advantages in a state.-.ent on Monday on tne communications with the Dominions.   The wording would have to be carefully chosen, and a further communlcation with the Dominions was necessary. The reply  coul&quot; be received before Monaay .The Home Secretary thought tx.at the result of tne Dominions* re*ly fcight carry far.   It had been agreed on the previous day tnat the objection to a broadcast by th&lt;  King was two-fold:    (1J Constitutional, {&lt;) practical.   Constitutional, on the ground that tne King could not make a public declaration of his views otherwise tnan on the advice of ni8 responsible Ministers.   The practical consideration had been that the King would be putting his view to the people over tut heads of his Minister* .     he King&apos;s proposal for a statement by the Prime Minister would amount to the same thing except that tne King&apos;s views would be aanouicedthe same whether the announcement were made through tne
microphone or through the Prime Minister*    If tne Prime Minister did that he would be putting before tne country the King&apos;s views on a public matter which did not coincide with tiiose of his constit utlonal &apos;idvioerB. Until the King announced that ne had such affection for Mrs Simpson that he would marry her tnough it involved abdication, there could be no constitutional footing for a statement.The Chancellor of the Sxchequer agreed.The Prime Minister said he would discuss tnis matterwith Mr Monoitton. wno no doubt would explain theConstitutional aspect to the King.(At this moment a letter was plaoed in the Prime Minister&apos;s hands.)The Prime Minister then read a letter from Mr WinstonChurchill reporting the result or nis interview with tneKing, with wnom he nad dined on the previous evening.In tins letter he explained that he had found that theKing, though confrontitkg his difficulties with ^reitcourage, was in a sttite of great nervous tension. Tnecoincidence of public difficulties and private stresswas one which even the most uardened politician couldbear only with difficulty.   He had told tue King&apos;sentoura^e that he thought His Majesty ought to be seenby his doctors, and he had suggested that if, in tnecircumstances, the King were to ask. the Prime Ministerfor time he tnought rich a request would be treated withthe utmost consideration.    It was, Mr Cnurcnill tnougnt,a cruel thing to extort a decision in tne King&apos;s presentcondition.The Home Secretary pointe1 out that if tne King were to adopt a &quot;stone-wall ng&quot; attitude the result would probably be to render the grant of a Decree Absolute to Mrs Simpson&apos;s divorce more doubtful,   tte tnougnt-6-
His Ma jest., ought to be warned of this risk by wuoever was the proper authority.   He thought also that the continuation of the present uncertainty might well imperil the divoroe.   The Cabinet had been told tuat the King wanted to marry the lady .    If he were to renounce the Throne now it was not improbable that the divorce would go through, as tne patriotic motive for stopping it would be removed.   But now, after the Prime Minister had announced tnat if the King married Mrs Simpson she must be Queen, strong efforts were likely to be made to challenge the divorce in the Courts.   Gossip, of course, went for nothing, out a King&apos;s movements necessarily involved a good deal of publicity, and if ingenuity were used it was not improbable that people with this aim might be able to geyevidence of the King&apos;s comings and goings. He thought, therefore, that the King ought to be told, and warned that if his aim was to be able to marry Mrs Simpson, &quot;stone-walling&quot; would not be a good wa^ of attaining that object.In reply to a suggestion that the King&apos;s conduct could not be enquired into by the Courts, the Home Secretary expressed doubts as to whether tnis was sound advice.   No-one could, of course,  foresee what the result would be, but if good evidence was available he doubted if the President of tne Divorce Court would be able to disregard it.   Evidence against &quot;an unknown person&quot; was sometimes enough to stop a divorce.The Minister of Health suggested that if the Prime Minister were to make a statement of tnis kind to tne King it reign*- be said afterwards that ne had used the divorce as a threat to force the King&apos;s hands.
The Home Secretary said the Prime Minister could be relied on not to threaten.The Lord Privy Seal t nought that that might be tried if the circumstances proved favourable. The question arose, however, as to whether, in the event of the adoption of *  tone-walling&quot; tactics, the Cabinet should give advice to the King.The Chancellor of tne Exchequer contrasted Mr Churcuill&apos;8 account of the King&apos;   condition with the account given several times by tne Prime Minister.The Cabinet were informed tiiat a rumour had been brought by the proprietor of an important newspaper that Lord Dawson and Sir Stanley Hewitt had been tosee the King.   Enquiries indicate.*, however, thatThe Prime Minister Lord Dev.eon had not left his htome.   xUt thought iioanswer to Mr Churchill was necessary, and ne did notpropose to see him.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thethat at short answer was that the present situation, in which the King had become the first news in every yaper in the world, could not continue.The Minister of Health recalled that what people were saying was &quot;Give the King time&quot; .The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat made all tne more important the statement to tneDominions.
The Home Secretary hoped that any announcement might include the statement that a month ago, the King had told the Prime Minister that he intended to renounce the Throne in order to enable him to marry Mrs. Simpson.     Thei-e had been no question for a need for DoctorB at that time.The Firot Lord urged that, in any event, there should be some statement on Monday.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the Prime Minister ought to tell the King this afternoon that a statement would be made. He ought to represent that the public would not wait any longer and that if the King&apos;s own statement could not be announced there would have to be another.The Prime Minister said he did not wish to continue the discussion any longer.     He understood the views of his colleagues and was grateful for the various suggestions.     He wanted now some time to think the position over und discuss it with a few of his colleagues.The Secretary of State for Air eaid the result of the discussion appeared to be that the Prime Minister would tell the King that he was bound to make some statement on Monday.The Prime Minister agreed.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, in reply to a request for information as to the latest telegrams from the Dominions, said that New Zealand and Australia agreed with the attitude taken up by the Cabinet towards the King&apos;s proposed broadcast.     The Prime Minister of Canada did notwant to send any further messuge/ but had authorised- 8 -
the Prime Minister to inform the King that his own personal message coui  now be regarded as official and had been confirmed by the Cubinet of the Dominion. There had been some rather awkward telegrams as to the form of legislation which would have to be considered carefully.The Prime Minister expressed the hope that the Cabinet woulu not be required either that day or Sunday.     There was no objection to hie colleagues leaving London, though he would hope that they would be within an hour&apos;s reuoh in case some emergency should arise.     Subject to the possibility of an emergency meeting, he would fix Monday, the 7th December, at 10.30 a.m. for a meeting at 10 Downing Street.I, Whitehall Gardens, s.W.l, December 5, 193 5.- 9 -
