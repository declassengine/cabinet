(THE CORONATION. Question of Eank Holiday Payments . (Previous Reference: Cabinet 12 (35J, Conclusion 13 .)1.   The Prime Minister raised tne question of tne varment of wages on the occasion of tne King&apos;s Coronation, a matter on wnicn Questions were already being addressed to mm in Parliament.Tiie Cabinet were reminded tnat on tne occasion of tne Silver Jubilee tne day nad been observed as a paid noliday to employees in Government establishments, including industrial grades, but txiat tne attitude of tne Government nad been tnat it was not a matter in wnicn tney could issue any directions to private employers, tnougn tney nad no doubt tnat tney could be relied upon to snow full cons iderat ion to tneir workpeople so far as circumstances permitted (Reply in Parliament on February *, 1935) .Tne Prime Minister said tnat ne would Iook into tne precedents, and if ne could not ascertain in time lie would as/v for a postponement of tne Question for a. week.
the defence programme.A Ministry of Supply .(Previous Reference: Cabinet 52 (35), Con-clasion 10 .E        2. (Tne Prime Minister instructed tnesecretary to make a full record of tnis discussion, wnicn nad been asked for tnat morning by Ministers wno could not be present.)Tne Cabinet resumed tne discussion, begun tnat:   morning, on tne Memorandum by tne minister for-   Co-ordination of Defence (C.P.-297 (35)) on tne ) .)present position of Ine Defence Programme and its presentation in tne Parliamentary Debate on tne Address.   Tne main issue was the question of a Ministry of Supply .Tne minister for Co-ordination of Defence said tnat he would have to speax in tne Debate on Tuesda., and must nave some decision on tne question of a Ministry of Supply .   He nad set out tne pros and cons of tne question in nis Paper.   Since tnen tne matter nad been complicated by tne issue of tne Report of tne Royal Commission on tne Private Manufacture of and Trading in Arms, Chapter VIII of wnicn nad contained some ratner vague references bearing on tne establishment of a Ministry of Supply .Turning to paragraph 128 of the heport, ne pointed out tnat three reasons nad been given for control by tne uovernment in peace time of all arms manufacture and arms manufacturing capacity in tne country. Tne tnird of tnese reasons, viz.:-&quot;To prevent tne possibility of profiteering in time of war or national emergency and thereby to eliminate tne incentive to tnose grave objections to wnicn tne system of private manufacture is open&quot;,was well within tne Terms of Reference to tne RoyalCommission,    but tne otner two reasons, namelyJ-&quot;(i) To ensure rapidity of expansion in emergency periods, and(ii)  To check prices and establish a planning system in peace-time conditions&quot;were not.   Tne Royal Commission made no constructive-2-
proposal bat merely referred to evidence by severalwitnesses.Tne question of a Ministry of Supply , necontinued , was not a nev. one     The war-time Ministryof Munitions had been abolisned after tne .var, laigely ,he understood , owing to tne attitude of Mr .vinstonCnurcnill.    In 1926 tne matter nad been consideredby Lord &lt;*eir&apos;s Committee on tne Amalgamation ofServices common to tne Navy and Army and Air Force.Tneir Terms of Reference nad been specific, namely -&quot;To make definite proposals for amalgamating as far as possible tne common services  .... sucn as intelligence, SupmIv etc.Tnat Committee nad co...e to the conclusion, in tnethen existing circumstances, tiiat  &quot;Tne amalgamation of tne common services of tne tnree.Departments is not advisable;   and we doubt if any substantial economies would tnereby be effected&quot;.Their conclusions had been accepted by tne Cabinet.Subsequently tnere nad been set up tne PrincipalSupply Officers Committee to co-ordinate tneseactivities, and. to tnis was attacned tne SupplyBoard, tne Board of Trade Supply organisation, andotner bodies .   Thus a co-ordinating body nad beencreated wnicn now ha? a permanent Cnairman for tneSupply Board and a permanent Chairman (nimself; fortne Principal Supply Officers Committee.Tne question of a Ministrj of Supply in time ofwar nad been* investigated jjy tne Principal SupplyOfficers Committee, and ne hoped in tne very nearfuture to present a cut-and-dried Scheme to tneCommittee of imperial Defence.   Tnere nad been anargument as to wnetner the Admiralty and tne AirMinistry  could contract out of a..y scheme, and neintended to maxe nis ov.n recommendations .-3-
Tnat was tne position as regards tnt war organisation, bat at tne mo_ent tne Cabinet were considering peacetime organisation,   tie had always thought tiiat tne priority organisation snould be improved.   Daring tne War ti.ere nad been a Priorities organisation over wnicn General Smuts nad presided, and tne establishment of a corresponding body was provided for in our war arrangements.   As tne result of a recent discussion With tne Machine Tools Association it was proposed to apply tne same machinery in time of peace not only to macnine tools but over tne wnole range of priorities between tne Services.   He was advised tnat tne organisation snould. not be too elaborate at tne outset . Tnat was one means of achieving priority without a Ministry of Supply .As tne weir Committee nad pointed out, tne setting Up of a Ministry of Supply would involve tne transfer to it from tne Service Departments of design and inspection and other matters.    It would also necessitate the conferring of powers on tne minister of Supply for settling questions between Government demand, and civilian demand;   tnat is to say, tne Minister would nave to nave powers to take from civil industry everything tnat he required, just as in wartime .    It almost amounted to a declaration of martial law in time of peace.If he were told that ne was to wor/. for readiness for war in June, 1937, powers of this Kind would, be required.   He felt bound to warn tne Cabinet, xiowever, tnat tne establishment of a Ministry of Supply did involve not only legislation but putting ine country practically on a war basis.He himself nad to admit tnat he felt tne increasing pressure of worK at tne present time.   He nad not tne leisure ne would liKe for consideration of large &lt;t 
questions .    If ne were to ad...it tnis in Parliament it would be said tnat tnis was part of tne case for a liinistry of Supply .   To nim, nowever, it seemed mat it was ratner a possible argument for someone to deal witn Supply questions wno might pemaps be subordinate to tne Minister for Co-ordination of Defence .Tne Secretary of tstate for Air said tnat ne nad been trying to tninx out tnis problem because ne tnougnt tnat tne forthcoming Debates in both houses of Parliament would turn largely on a Ministry of Supply.   Tne proposal made bj the Royal Commission tnat there Snould be a body and a minister witnout executive responsibility wno would lay down tne conditions under whien tne Service ministers and their Supply Department8 snould maxe tiieir contracts, was wholly impracticable.    It was quite possible to nave a Ministry of Supply wnicn would taxe over tne Supply functions of the Services and place tne orders for ...unit ions.    It was equally practicaole to have tne tnree Services placing their own contracts . wnat was quite impossible, in nis view, was to maxe tne Services responsible for all negotiations for contracts, while another Minister, without executive responsibility , would lay down now tnose contracts snould. be placed.Tne  case for a Ministry of Supply was put broadly on the following grounds I (a) It would avoid overlapping and resolve conflicts of priority ;(b) It would ensure tne supply of raw . material to Service needs:( c)  It would quicxen production deliveries and use all available firms to tne best advantage, and divert botn firms and labour to munitions production.Re would lixe dispassionately to consider tneseargoments in turn.-5-
He did not tain* tnat tnere nad yet arisen any serious overlapping or conflict of priority. Tne worx already done by tne Committee of Imperial Defence and t^e minister for Co-ordination nad defined fairly clearly for tne Services botn tneir regular contractors and tne fields in wnicn tney could respectively expand in bringing in non-munition firms.   Under present conditions it appeared to mm tnat any difficulties of overlapping or priority wnicn might arise could be rapidly resolved by tne Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements or tne minister for oo-ordination.So far as raw material was concerned, nis information iii regard to aircraft was tnat no serious difficulties nad as yet arisen.   Firms producing alumini-uu alloys v.ere expanding tneir plants, and steps were being taken, on tne authority of tne Couhiittee on Defence Policy and requirements, to accumulate reserve supplies of special commodities wnere a shortage might be feared.If difficulties witn regard to shortage of raw material and priority of delivery snould occur, tne,, were mucii more lixel,,  to taxe the form of a conflict between munitions and civil industry than a conflict between tne services.    If s^en a situation arose it would :;iean not co-ordination betveen tne Services, but some system of control, agreed or imposed, by wmcn tne Services obtained tne necessary priority.Re would also mention maenin&amp; tools.    It was probably impossible today  for machine tool maxers to .^eet concurrent ly all oervice a.id civil de.uands ; mi nere, again, tne minister for Co-ordination, and oir Artnu   Robinson, nad given great nelp in getting tne machine tool m-.xers to adopt a voluntary priority. 6 
- (As regards the other reasons, it appeared to aim idle to consider tne establishment of a minister of Supply unless v.e were quite clear wnat powers he snoulj exercise      In order to consider tnis we nad to see wnat were tne difficulties whicn control coald meet.Tne first and most obvious difficulty was tne shortage of skilled labour.    It existed now.    It would become more acute in spite of all effort-; to de-sxill jobs.    If we could divert labour from non-munition to munition work we could certainly accelerate production. Eut it was very important to realise that this was a proble... of diverting labour and not a problem of diverting firms.   Diversion of firms from civil to munition work would not yield early results; indeed, the results would very likely not materialise until tne peajs. production nad been reached, in tne expansion of professional firms and the full functioning of tne snadow factories .Explaining wnat ne meant by diversion of labour and wnat its effect would be, tne Secretary of State for Air said that if we could &quot;pick the eyes out of&quot;, say, Singer&apos;s sewing machine uotks and certain otner engineering firms and put that labour into munition firms v.e snould in a comparatively snort time get improved production, but we must consider tne inevitable results of sucn a process.   The diversion of labour wnich would nelp was not a diversion of all tne labour in a factory ;    it was the diversion of its ekilled labour   wnat ne nad  called &quot;picking tne eyes out of&quot; tne factory.   Tne immediate result would be to tnrov, out of employment in sucn a factory a number of tne residue of the workers wno wouldfnot be diverted. But tne results would go further tnan that. The sKilled labour tnat would be useful was in tne-7-
engineering industry .   A large part of tnat industry was aot making direct consumer&apos;s goods, jut .machinery wnich served otner producin-  industries,   we snould tnerefore get a quicK reaction upon tne production in tnese iimiustries     on tneir workers     on tneir customers&apos;    on tne whole volume of trade.If something on tnose lines nad to be done, ne was inclined to think tnat tne least damaging plan wo aid be some plan rationing tne production and/or tne amount of labour employed by engineering firms. But any plan of tnat Kind would be a very difficult and long business in peace.    In war it was simple. All industry and labour and material would in fact be controlled , and tne industry  and labour of tne country would wor k on a national plan.Tnere was a second difficulty wnich might be met by giving a Minister of supply compulsory powers over all munition firms.   Tnat would enable tne Minister to maKe these firms do exactly wnat tne Supply Programme required and not wnat tney wanted to do . For example, as long as everyone was free to accept orders or not, firms, particularly tne smaller firms wno were not producing under direct contract wnat was needed, were always trying to maKe tne government order wnat it suited, them to produce and. not wnat the government wanted.   Tnere were also difficulties someti es in getting a main contractor to use a particular firm.    It would, he believed, simplify a.id accelerate production if tnere were ^ovver to order Firm A to x orK for Pirui 3, and order rir.u B to accept tne wotk from Firm A.   xlor was tnis limited form of control unreasonable, because all tne firms who would be affected in tnat way were anxious to get Government orders&apos;,   and it was reasonable tnat b 
tae Government, which was giving txxem tne bulx of their work, should get oat of txiem exactly wxiat it wanted .Assuming always txiat labour was available, tne firms, professional and shadow, wxiicn wert now engaged in a great expansion of t^eir v.orxs , would probably reach their nign pea*, by. the middle or end of 1938, some earlier.    e snould, therefore, by tnat date nave very large facilities ready , and tnese facilities would in all probability be ready sooner than could facilities provided by firms coiupulsonly turned over to munition production.   For example, even tne snadow factories, let alone tne new shops and plant of professional firms, should be at tneir peax before newly diverted firms could be in peax production.   Our acute problem, therefore, was not so moon turning over more firms to munitions, but getting tne existing plans implemented and accelerated.The Secretary of State said tnat xxe nad come to tne conclusion tnat a control of selected firms, Will on were or desired to be largely munition firms, would nelp.   At a later stage some arrangement or control whicn would prevent non-munition firms absorbing labour would undoubtedly help, if tnat were practicable. Tne^ might, indeed, come to some agreement in order to avoid further control .Tne First Lord of tne Admiralty considered that there could be no finality in tnis matter.    It was impossible to say what we might nave to do in two or three months time.   So far as tne Navy was concerned, no additional powers were required ai tne moment. A minister of Supply without D.O.x\.A. powers would virtually be useless.    In twoor three weeks&apos; time it would be shown to be nurnbug without sucn powers . ...essrs VicXers had warned nim txiat tnej did not want-9-
any big move of the Kind now and tnat it.would only give a set-bae^.   Labour was going on well, and,witn tne tacit co-operation of local labour, dilution and otner arrangements to stimulate production were being carried out.    If some large measure, such as tnat involved in a ministry of Supply, were adopted, it mignt caust great commotion.   So nis advice woul be not to -yifcjudit*, tne future, and to give a clear explanation to tne House of Commons snowing tnat tne proposal for a ministry of Supply involved D.O.n.A, powers and tne possibility of an immense upneaval.Tne Minister of Labour agreed that i-&apos; a ministry of Supply were appointed it would be necessary to taKe tne powers referred to, but it was not sufficient to consider only tne demands of tne Services, but also those of tne  civil industries.   His information was that it would cause immense difficulties until tne Government knew exactly wnat tney wanted made, and where.Tne Secretary of State for &lt; ar agreed with tne otner iviiiiisters .   Tnere was no finality in tnis matter. Tne Royal Corui&apos;mtssion nad undoubtedly stimulated, tne demand for a Ministry of supply .    In nis view we snould certainly need it in a major v.ar.   He was not satisfied that we needed it today, nor that it was liKely to come in time of peace .    If we nad a ministry of Supply we snould nave to go to all lengtns, and if D.O.R.A. were put in force tnere vas no Knowing wnat tne reaction against it mignt be .   rfnen tne new Director-General of munitions Supply was appointed ne nad been tolc1 tnat tne object was to create a miniature Ministry of Munitions*   The idea had. been the creation of a nucleus which could be expanded in cace of necessity.   He thought the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence might say something of tne kind in tne Debate .   He himself nad felt some
doubt about tne appointment of a minister of Defence, bat he agreed tnat the system today was working admirably .   He was ratner alarmed, nowever, at tne idea of another Defence minister,   His advisers held that no new ministry was required, and tnat its establishment would be fraught witn danger.Tne Chancellor of tne Exchequer said tnat Mr Cnurcnill and nis friends would represent tne recommendation of the Royal Commission as an endorse-ment of tneir demand  for a ministry of Supply, rie looped tnat tne minister for Co-ordination of Defence would indicate tne difference between the two things . de could explain tne formidable difficulties in tne proposals of tne Royal Commission, but it would be advisable for nim not to reject them tnere and then, but to say tnat tne Government were considering tne matter and would announce tneir decision later.Mr Churchill, ne&apos;pointed out, had never stated clearly what attributions he would assign to a minister of Munitions or Supply.   Re na^ suggested, in tne course of tne Deputation to tne Prime minister, tnat tne Minister would taxe an industry lixe, say, some bicycle manufactory and would inform tne management tnat tney must allocate 25 per cent, of tneir output to munitions .   Tnat would not help in tne least.   25 per cent, would dislocate tne wnole business, but to dissipate our orders a...ong thousands of firms doing part-time would be perfectly useless. He hoped tnat tne Minister for Co-ordination of Defence would indicate tnat in war we snould probably have to set up ~o._.ething of the kind, but tnat ne would point out tne great difficulties ih time of peace, and that compulsory powers would be required, enabling tne Government to compel one firm to worx for another firm and.   if tne royal Commission wasto be followed   practically without profits.-11-
He tnougnt consideration would nave to be givento tne sort of assistance required for tue ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence.   He realised tnat tuepressure on tne Minister was steadily increasing.New proposals were coming forward every day for stocks of raw/    materials, food stuffs, and a..y number of otnersuggestions .   He could quite believe tnat tne number of vital problems was so large tnat tne minister required furtner assistance,   rie noped, nowever, tnat tne assistance would not ta&amp;e tne form of tne estab-lisimaent of a new and e^ual minister, bat ratner of some increase of nis own staff.Tne minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointed out tnat nis staff consisted only of a Principal Assistant Secretary, a Private Secretary, and a Lady T^ pis t  Tne Secretary of ^tate for Foreig.. Affairs said tnat wnat troubled nim was tne date to wnicn our progra.:. .es were working    we nad passed tnrougn tne preset year witnout any major European crisis, but next year ne thought t^at some cnallenge was possible any  time  fro.;. Spring onwards, and tnat tne position ought to be exa-.ii.ie;1 in tne lignt of tnat possibility. He tnougnt tnat the Cabirmt ought to nave before them a cle r picture of our strengtn next ma;/ with reference to tnat of otner nations.The Secretary of State for war said tnat in the Spring tne Army would still be utterly unprepared for war, and that by no possible means could matters be got right by tnat time.Tne Secretary of State for Air said he nad wonted Out hoi  we would stand from April to June 1937, 193b and 1939, botn as regards tne numbers of squadrons, t..e output, a..d, in tne later period, tne possibility of taking so..ie forces from reserve.-12-
He hoped to send nis appreciation to tne minister ftor Co-ordination of Defence.Tne Prime minister tnooght it was important to envisage tnat subject, witn a view to later decisions by tiie Cabinet .   He t.iougnt tnat tne line taxen b,, tne Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was about rignt for tne Debate on Tuesday , b^t furtner information would be required for later consideration bj tne Cabinet.Tne Cabinet agreed  (a) TO approve generally tne line wnicn the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence proposed to taxe, as set fortn in nis Memorandum (C.P.-297 (35)) as developed in nis re..arxs at tne Meeting summarised above:(b) That tne Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence snould  consider wnat furtner information snould be prepared for tne Cabinet when tne^   came to consider furtner Foreign Policy and Defence.(Tne record of tnc discussion is  cont in^ed in Conclusion 3 below.)
IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY.ITALYRelations with. (Previous Reference: Cabinet 62 (36) Conclusion 4.)c 13.     The discussion at this point passedto broader aspects of Imperial Defence policy.The First Lord of the Admiraltyobserved that it would be necessary to assume fora long time that we should be unprepared.This meant that our foreign policy would haveto proceed very quietly.     The first point wasto get Italy out of the list of countries withwhom we had to reckon.The Prime Minister said that, inaddition, we must go on steadily with ourdefensive Programme.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs did not dissent, but he pointed outthat the attitude suggested by the First Lordmight be mistaken for flabbiness.The Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence agreed that that was the dilemma. Washe to indicate that we were weak or strong?The Secretary of State for theColonies said that the issue always came backto one of foreign policy.     There was a feelingin the country that we were tied up too muchwith France and that that prevented us gettingon terms with the dictator Powers.The Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence said that was why he wanted to wipeout the past and get once more on good termswith Italy.     That would solve at a strokea number of problems of intense difficulty. Thefirst thing to be done was to get rid of theAbyss?nian question.     It was true that mostpeople had been shocked at the Italian action,but it would be folly to let Italy think that- 14 -
we were nursing a grievance.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed in principle, hut said that it was a very difficult gesture to make.     The Italian attitude was due to Italian psychology. In suspecting us of designs in the Mediterranean, they were treating us as though we were Italians and thinking of what they would do in our place. He agreed that we must somehow disillusion the Italians of their suspicions hut, in doing so, we must not break with the League of Nations. In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that the question of recognition of Abyssinia would probably come up at the League early next year. He was very doubtful if the Member States would be prepared to recognise Italy.     In reply to a suggestion that he might withdraw our Minister from Addis Ababa, he explained that Italy would regard it as a form of recognition on the ground that we should have to ask for an exequatur for aConsul or Consul-General.     We 6hould, of course,heresay very stoutly/that it was not a form of recognition.The Lord Privy Seal was anxious that we should not say anything that would tie our hands for recognition in the future.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it riobable that when Sir Austen Chamberlain returned from France he would urge that we should take some action in regard to Abyssinia to avoid the difficulty that had arisen over Manchukao, where even now we did not recognise the Japanese occupation.- 15 -
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affaire suggested that there would be a movement towards a more realistic attitude at Geneva.The Minister of Labour thought that public opinion here wanted an agreement between Prance, Germany, Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom.The Lord President of the Council said we must work towards a position where we could shake hands with Italy:    that should be our objective, otherwise we might reach a situation of great difficulty.     He suggested that the Foreign Office should make a survey of the whole situation with a view to constructing a European policy:    then we should get the Ambassadors to understand where we stood.     So far as Tuesday&apos;s debate was concerned, he thought, after listening to the discussion, that they should confirm generally the views of the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence who would, of course, take into account what had been said by others at the Cabinet.     He was not sure that the recommendation of the Royal Commission would prove so formidable an obstacle.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that we should work towards better relations with Italy, but he did not want to discuss with the Italian Government the naval position in the Mediterranean - at any rate until we were a good deal stronger.The First Lord of the Admiralty was also averse to detailed discussions until we were stronger.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should in the light of the discussion adopt a policy of improving relations with Italy. -16-
Betailed commentsRj c.p. 297 (36)I f I4.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the following passage on the first page of C.P. 297 (36):-&apos; (1) While the necessity of appropriate measures of preparation for a major war is not forgotten, the immediately pressing problem, etc.&quot;He asked the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence to be careful lest his critics should infer from this that we were not taking seriously the preparations for a major war.He then referred to the following:-&quot;(3) That the task is to be carried out &apos;without impeding the course o f no rmal trade&apos;.&quot;In this connection, he pointed out that we were already interfering to a considerable extent in trade so he thought the point shoulu not be stressed.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence said he proposed on the latter point to say that this was a counsel of perfection, but that, in fact, we had found it necessary to interfere in regard to the machine tool manufacturers and some other branches of industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then quoted the following passage on page 2:-&quot;The Government have also, as necessity has arisen, approved extensions, both large and costly, to the supplies estimated to be required under the original programme - the expanded scheme for Air Defence of Great Britain is a good instance of this.&quot;He recalled that as laid down in the White Paper -&quot;It must once more be emphasised that the plans for the improvement of our defensive forces in all three Services must be regarded as flexible and subject to variation in details from time to time.     The whole field of preparation will have to be kept - 17 -
under constant review, and new conditions, whether arising from changes in the dispositions of other nations or from fresh developments in design and invention, must be met by corresponding variations in our own plans.&quot;    (Cmd.5107, paragraph 45.)In addition,  the White Paper had contained thefollowing:-&quot;Prom what has already been said as to the necessary flexibility of this pro gramme, and in view of the uncertainty which must exist as to the rate of progress possible over so large a field, it will be realised that any attempt to estimate the total cost of the measures described would be premature at this stage.&quot;     (Paragraph 62.)He had, in consequence, always refused to giveany estimate of the cost of the Programme andhe asked the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence to be careful in this matter.The Chancellor added that he wasgetting concerned at the mounting cost ofthe Programme.     It was difficult for him totake up a line in opposition in this matter ofnational safety, but he wanted the Cabinet torealise that the cost was mounting at a giddyrate.     The original estimate of  400,000,000was already far exceeded and programmes wereconstantly increasing.     Before long, he thoughtpeople would be talking about an unbalancedBudget, and we might find that our credit wasnot so good as it was a few years ago. Hesaid this because while recognising thatnational safety came first our resources were notunlimited and we wore putting burdens onfuture generations;    also because whileassuming that what was essential when theexistence of the nation was at stake, he- 18 -
wanted Government Departments not to think that &quot;because a heavy expenditure was being incurred, this was a time to slip in developments of convenience which had been refused in the past.     He was always watching the situation in case the opportunity should arise for saying something publicly, but for him to speak on these aspects of the question at the moment would, he thought, produce a bad effect.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I, 5th November, 1936.
