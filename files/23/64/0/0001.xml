EGYPT .ingle-Egyptianrfreaty.previous reference:Cabinet 23(30), Con-elusion lo)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet full particulars of the presentposition of the negotiations with the egyptian delegation.   Just before Easter, agreement had beenreached on all points except the Sudan, and thePrime Minister of Egypt had asked for an adjournment^vhen the Conference had re-assembled on the previous day the Egyptian Prime Minister had asked for afurther adjournment,  on the ground that the courierwho had been expected from Egypt had not -arrived.The Cabinet were given evidence indicating a *probability that the delay in the arrival of thecourier was not entirely accidental and that theEgyptian Delegation might be desirous of delaying adecision, whether in the hope of deriving advantage from events outside of Egypt or otherwise.As regards the immediate situation, two alterna-tive courses were, discussed:    either (i) to show no desire for an immediate settlement, and, if theEgyptian Delegation insisted on further delay, to fall in with their views even to the extent, ifnecessary, of postponing a d-eeision until after thereturn of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs from the m.meeting of the Council of theLeague of Nations at Geneva at the end of next-week: or (ii) in view of the somewhat equivocalattitude of the Egyptian Delegation, to bring thenegotiations to a head by insisting that theyshould either accept or reject the Treaty as agreed to before Easter.The Cabinet agreed  (a) As regards the immediate situation,to leave the decision to theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs:
(b)  In the event of a breakdown inthe negotiations, to adopt thepolicy proposed by the Secretaryof State *&apos;or Foreign /-flairs,na*; ely, that there should be noultimatum to the Egyptian Govern-inent:    that the Treaty as agreedto before Easter should at once be published:    that a statement should be made in Parliament tothe effect that agreement had. beenreached in regard to Bigypt but thata hitch had arisen in regard to theSudan:    to make quite clear thatHis Majesty^ Government had no desire to - turn   the Sudan into aEritish Possession but merelyinsisted on exercising theirtrusteeship effectively:    and throughout to leave no room fordoubt that the Treaty as agreedonly awaited acceptance so far asHis Majesty&apos;s Government areconcerned.
2. The Secretary of State -for Foreign Affairsconsulted the Cabinet as to the desirability of keeping up the custom of a Dinner to the diplomatic corps on the occasion of the King*s Birthday on june 3rd.After considering various precedents, theCabinet agreed - That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should give thecustomary Dinner on the occasion of His Majesty&apos;s Birthday;    that,in addition to the Diplomatic Corps,he should invite members o^ theGovernment&apos;    and that he should use his discretion as to inviting formermembers of the British diplomatic service according to the numbers involved.THE KING rSBIRTHDAYThe S ec?.r et aryof State forForeign Affairs&apos;-Dinner.
UNITED STATESfop AMERICA.Liquor Smug-gllng .(Pr ev i previous reference;Cabinet 13(S9)-; Con-elusion 2.)3.  The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper CP.132 (30)) covering a Memorandum dealing with thedesire of the United States Consul at Edinburghto be informed by the Collector of Customs atLeith when ship-ments of liquor are made from, that port to Amsterdam, Antwerp, Copenhagen and Hamburg,which have been in the past, and doubtless atillare, used as bases for the illicit liquor trade.In the enclosed Memorandum it was Stated that theAmerican proposal   had been submitted officiallyto the Board of Customs and Excise with a rscommen-dation that it should be acceded to, and that theBoard of Customs and Excise had agreed that thefacilities sought for should be granted, and in doing so outlined in detail the procedure to beadopted, adding that they attached considerable importance to the principle that confidential information o^ this nature should be furnished onlyto career members of the American Consular Serviceand not communicated to temporary or unsalariedemployes .Subject to the condition proposedby the Board of Customs and Excise,the Cabinet approved the proposal that the United States Consul atEdinburgh should be informed bythe Collector of Customs at Leithwhen shipments of liquor are made from that port to Amsterdam, Antwerp,Copenhagen and Hamburg.
4.The Cabinet had before thee a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (Paper 0.P.-133(50)) on the subject of the Civil Disobediencecampaign and the present situation in India, givingthe facts of the present position, together withthe considerations which the Governor-General andhis Council are weighing in the light of opinionscollected urgently from all Local Governments.In a document circulated separately were appendedthe telegrams sent by the Viceroy to all local governments and Administrations, together withtheir replies, in regard to the question of the arrest of Mr Gandhi.The Secretary of State for India gave the gist of further telegrams from Local Governments andAdministrations.   He also read telegrams from theViceroy, in one of which particulars were given ofa deterioration in the situation on the North-west frontier, including the extension of intensivepropaganda to outlying areas, and reports of theuse of the Red Flag with Hammer and Sickle.    in another telegram the Viceroy intimated that it had now been found necessary to arrest Mr Gandhi, andthat he had authorised the Governor-General of bombay to take action under the Bombay Regulationof 1828.The Cabinet were informed that the question of whether Gandhi should be arrested and tried forsome specific breach of the law, or interned withouttrial under the Bombay Regulation of 1828, had beenthe subject of anxious consideration*   The conclusionof the Government of India was that internment as apolitical prisoner under the Regulation of 18S8
would be less repugnant to Indian public opinion thanprosecution under the ordinary law.   The former coursewould also facilitate the rapid removal of MT Gandhi toa place of detention and would avoid the excitement of atrial.    It would also.leave the period of detentionindeterminate and in the hands of the Government ofIndia, and would, on the whole, make it easier to releasehim experimentally in the event of a hunger-strike.The Cabinet, while realising that the course about to be adopted by the Government of India would be criticised in this country, recognised the necessity of deferring to the opinion of the Viceroy in a matter ofthis kind.After discussing the whole situation, the Cabinetfa) That the Secretary of State for india should have authority to inform the&quot;Viceroy that the Cabinet approved thedecision to arrest Gandhi and to internJiim under the provisions of the BombayRegulation of 1828.    He was asked to &apos;inform the Viceroy at the same time that the Cabinet felt the greatest^confidence in:the manner in which thesituation had been handled and did not wish to Interfere in matters of detail:(b) That the Secretary of State should alsobe authorised to inform the Viceroy thatthe recent occurrences in India, had inno way altered the policy of the Govern-ment in regard to the solution of theIndian political and constitutional problem and that the Cabinet had decidedthat a statement to this &apos;effect shouldbe made public.    Further, that.in thecourse of this statement (which   wouldbe made on or about the date of Mr Gandhi&apos;sarrest) it should be announced that theIndian Conference would mee: approximatelyon the 20th October, this date havingbeen selected deliberately so as to over-lap with the Imperial Conference, whichit was felt might prove advantageous:(c) That the Secretary of State for india should arrange to make a statement, inParliament, in reply to a Question, onthe above lines:
(d) That the Secretary of State forIndia should prepare,  for consid-eration by the Cabinet, a Memo-randum in regard to recent events in India as bearing on the Termsof Reference to the Indian Confer-ence, which, it was agreed, shouldbe announced not before, but simul-taneously with or immediately afterthe publication of the Simon Commis-sion&apos;s report (e) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows  The Secretary of State for India(In the Chair),The Prime Minister,The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The First Commissioner of Works,and the following when the businessof the Committee rendered it desir-able -The President of the Board of Trade,The Chiefs of Staff of the three fighting Services,The Military Secretary, India Office  should be appointed to assist theSecretary of State for India to such extent as he may desire in dealingwith, or preparing for, politicaland military eventualities in India.(NOTE; It was arranged that thisCommittee should meet thesame afternoon at 4 p.m.)
