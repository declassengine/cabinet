THE KING&apos;SSPEECH.(previous reference:Cabinet 45(SO),  Oon-conclusion 2.)(A copy of the King&apos;s Speech,  as approvedby the Cabinet, is attached in the Appendix.)draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation ofFarliam ent on August I,  19 SO, as am ended at theMeeting mentioned in the margin (G.p.-269 (30)) .The Cabinet approved,  for subroission to The Kingfor signature, the draft Speech, subject to a revision of the last sentence of the penultimateparagraph on page S, to read as follows:-&quot;It is  encouraging to find thatschemes have been designed toprovide useful employment inworks of public utility of atotal balue of over  100,040,000.This has boon made possible by asubstantial contribution granted by My G ov government ent .&quot;
2. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he would be absent from midday on the following day until the afternoon of Tuesday next, August5th.    On August 6th he proposed to leave forLossiemouth.   Arrangements would have to be made during the Recess for at least one Secretary ofState to be available within immediate reach ofLondon to deal with any matters of urgency thatmight arise in the Foreign Office or other Offices.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That during the Prime Minister&apos;forthcoming absence the Chancellorof the Exchequer should act for him in any matters of urgency:(b) That in the event of any emergencyarising during the Recess requiringimmediate Ministerial guidance,the Permanent Under-Secretory ofState, Foreign Office, if unable,in the absence of the Secretary o^State for Foreign Affairs, tocommunicate with the Prime Minister,should refer to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer or to one of the secretaries of State within reach of London.   The same principle should apply to other Departments,in similar circumstances:(c) That Cabinet Ministers should, asfar as possible, keep the cabinet office informed of their addressesin case any emergency should arise.
3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (0.P.-S73 (30))circulating for the information of his colleaguestelegraphic correspondence between himself andthe Government of India on the subject of thecontinuance of the Bengal Criminal Law AmendmentOrdinance, whether permanently, or by Act,  or for short periods.    The Pengal Government proposed tointroduce a Bill to continue in force, withouttime limit, the full provisions of the BengalCriminal Law Amendment Act,  1925.   The Secretaryof State had pointed out to the Government of Indiacertain objections to this course,  and suggestedthat the present Ordinance should be continued by the use of the Govcrnor-General&apos;s emergency powers of action by Ordinance, which, however,would only be effective for six mionths on each occasion of use.    The view of the Government ofIndia was that the existing Ordinance should bereplaced by legislation and that  such legislation should be permanent, without limitation of time,although they would be prepared, if it would ease the passage of the Bill, to accept an amendmentlimiting the operation of the proposed measure toa period of not less than ten years .   If theintroduction       the Bill were authorised, the bengal Government would need to give notice of it not later than July 31st.   The matter was, there-fore,  one of great urgency.Having regard to the great importance whichthe Government of India have attached to themaintenance of a friendly atmosphere for the round-Table Conference and the avoidance of anyprovocative measures, the Cabinet agreed  
That the Secretary of State forIndia should inform the Viceroythat the Cabinet, while just as strongly impressed as the Govern-sent of India with the seriousness of the internal situation, vwerenevertheless disturbed at the effectthat the introduction and possiblerejection of permanent legislation was likely to have on that situa-tion.    Fe should therefore press the Government of India to contentthe&apos;&apos; selves with a continuance ofthe present Ordinance by the useof the G ov ernor-G eneral&apos;s em erg encypowers of action by Ordinance,which would confer on the BengalGovernment all the power-s thatthey require until next Springwhen the question could be reviewed.
(pr evioiisORef erence:Cabinet 53(29),  Con-elusion 6 .)3PH CTi(c*4-The Cabinet had before there a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (C.P.-281 (30))covering telegrams from the Government of Indiaand from His Majesty&apos;s representative at Kabulon the subject of a request from the AfghanGovernment for a cash gift of  400,000 and thesupply free of charge of 20,000 rifles with 1,000rounds of ammunition each, to enable them to proceedwith the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the re-establishment of internal order.    In his covering memorandum the Secretary of State pointed out thatwe were already committed in principle by previousundertakings to the grant of assistance, and that,apart from any pledges, Afghan reconstruction isdefinitely in our interest and a friendly Nadirmeans a great deal to us .   He admitted that thecharge involved must be borne by&apos;Indian revenues.The Secretary of State&apos;s recommendations were asfollows:-(a) general that we should accept inprinciple the desirability of grantingat e^ial and financial assistance to afghanistan for purposes of recon-stauction and the re-establishmentof internal order.fb) Rifles.-   That the Afghans should begranted,  as proposed by the government&quot; India, 10,000 rifles with 500rounds of ammunition each, if prac-ticable without scabbards and bayonets.I would leave the Government of india a free hand to grant 1,000 rounds ofammunition per rifle if on furtherconsideration they think this desirable.The Government of India&apos;s proposal thata similar gift should be contemplatedlater, if circumstances render thisdesirable, to be approved, but no commitment on the subject to be enteredinto with the Afghans at this stage.! c) Money ..-(i) The amount of the financial assist-ance to Afghanistan to be fixed at 200,000.    Every endeavour to bemad.e by the Minister to persuade
the Afghans to accept this  as a       *&quot;non-interest-bearing loan, andnot as a gift.    Should, it prove impossible to attain this object,the Minister to be authorised tooffer a gift;(ii) the cost to be borne by Indianrevenues;(iii)  the loan or gift to be paid intwo instalments of  100,000, thesecond instalment to be paid a^ter an interval of,,  say,  four months, and to be conditional onNadir behaving well and conditionsgenerally being satisfactory.Before any commitment is enteredinto by His Majesty&apos;s Minister,efforts to be made, as suggestedby the Government of India in para.4 of their telegram of 22ndJuly, and in such manner as theMinister thinks best, to reach a clearer understanding of the objects to which the money is tobe devoted?(iv) the Minister to make every endeavourto persuade the Afghan Governmentto withdraw their request for asterling credit in London,  and toaccept instead either(a) the coinage of Afghan silvercurrency up to the a-rountsstipulated by the government f India; or(b) the opening of a rupee creditin India or Kabul;(v) the Government of India&apos;s viewthat secrecy is probably impossibleto be accepted.(d)  In general the minimum in the way ofexplicit conditions to be attached tothe assistance now proposed to be givento Afghanistan.    In general also theMinister&apos;s tactics,  as described in para.15 o&quot;^ his telegram of 14th July, to beadopted in this regard.    The Ministerto be left a wide discretion as to thehandlin-? of the desiderata set out in paras. 5 (a) and (b) of the Governmentof India&apos;s telegram of 22nd July (itwill probably be letter as regardspara.,5(a) to intimiate the purposeof the gift without requiring.an assurance; and as regards para.5(b),to indicate,- at his discretion, that non-interference with our tribes is anunderlying assumption of our support inthe present case).    The Minister,, however,
to make every endeavour,  cons ist-ently with not spoiling the effectof the assistance promised,  to persuade the Afghan Government tomeet us on air questions on thelines proposed by the government^ India in their telegram of the22nd July.The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that, while agreeing that this particularcharge should be borne by Indian revenues, he must nevertheless warn them that this was part ofthe larger question of Imperial Defence in India,the burden of which ought not for ever to be a.charge on Indian revenues.    It was a subject whichwould require examination in the near future.After considerable discussion, which revealedsom.e reluctance to grant the assistance in cashand in arms proposed, the Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for India asset forth, above.
5. After hearing a statement from the PrimeUnited KingdomRepr es ent at iv esMi the Round-^ble Confer-enoe.(previous reference:Cabinet 44(30),  Con-clusion 1.)Minister, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the representation of theUnited Kingdom at the forthcomingRounds-Table Conference should be composed as follows :-6 or 8 members of the Cabinet.4 Members of Parliament (House ofLords or House of Commons)from the Conservative Party.4    .. ..from the Liberal Party.(NOTE.   The Prime Minister explainedthat the understanding was thatthe Opposition representatives would be free to take a contro-versial attitude in the Conferenceif they so desired.   The Governmentrepressentatives,wtoLle being equallyfree to take part in the Conference,would not be expected to take a controversial line, but would preserve a judicial attitude,confining themselves in themain to asking questions inorder to elicit the facts.)(b) That the nucleus of the Governmentrepresentation should be as follows:-The Prime Minister.The Secretary of State for India.The Lord Chancellor.The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,and one or more other ministers who would be selected for.eachmeeting according to the subjectof discussion:That in regard to the proposals that had been made for the representationof the Indian Statutory Commission,the policy of the Government shouldbe as set forth in the followingAnswer to be given by the PrimeMinister to a Question in theHouse of Commons the same evening :-&quot;This question and those involvedin it have been exhaustively con-sidered by the Government inconsultation with the indian government:.   The statutory commission has performed itstask with a distinction whichwill secure for its Report apermanent place in our officialpolitical literature and haspresented its findings to Parlia-ment.    ^hen the Conference we are(c)
now contemplating was proposedby the Chairman of the commission with the consent of his colleagues,the Government alone was to havetaken upon itself the burden of negotiations.   We have widened- this so that Parliament in itsvaried composition might berepresented.   There the Govern-ment is certain it would be advis-able to stop, and not add anothersection of delegates to the repre-sentation announced yesterday.nhe Government is confident thatthe representatives to be selectedwill be able to get from theConference the fullest examinationof every proposal brought before it.and every opportunity v.-ill be takento secure that the most expert and well-informed advice, wherever itis to be &quot;found, will be availableboth for the Government and theParliamentary group of representa-tives.    Ine Government is convincedthat a departure from this decision will not ease the task nor promote the success of the Conference&quot;.(NOTE:      The discussion which led to this latter Conclusion took place atthe end of the Meeting, but isadded here as a matter o^ convenience-ence.)
6. The Cabinet had before their, a Memorandum bythe Secretary 0^ Stats *&quot;or India (CP.-200 (30))raising for consideration the question o&quot; theinstructions to be issued to the British envoynow on his way to Lhasa to confer with the PalaiLama of Tibet.    Owing to the gresent unsettledcondition cf China, the Secretary of State, whoseopinion was accepted-by the Secretary o^ State forForeign Affairs, supported the view of the Govern-ment of Injjia that no useful purpose is likely tobe served at the present moment by endeavouringto revive negotiations in regard to a final settle-ment o^ relations between Tibet and China,,. andparticularly ac regards the Sino-Tibetan frontier.It was likely, however,  that the Tibetans, whenadvised to postpone the reopening of negotiations,might request facilities to obtain the material assistance necessary to maintain their presentposition in certain districts on the Chinesefrontier, the position of which is in dispute.The Government of India recommended that as Tibetwould, be able to obtain her requirements elsewhere,to cur serious disadvantage, reasonable requests**or materials,  especially munitions  &apos;which demands were likely to be small) should be met^ subject to-payment and to the condition that the TibetanGovernment gives an assurance in writing that suchmunitions will be used solely for self-defence andfor internal police work.    In agreement with theSecretary o^ State for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for India proposed, subject tothe concurrence, of his colleagues, to approve the recommendation of the Government of India,but to couple his approval with an intimation .Instruct i oneto the Brit-ish Fnvoy.(previous reference:Cabinet 21(30), Ocn-oluo ion 8 t)
9 ^ 0o ( 6that it remains the policy of Eis Majesty&apos;sGovernment to rep oh a friendly settlement betweenChina and Tibet as soon as  conditions make this possible.The Cabinet agreed  .(a) To approve the proposal  of theSecretary of State for India thatno useful purpose would be servedat the present time by revivingnegotiations in regard to a finaldettlenient of relations betweenTibet and China:(b) That no authority should be givenbeforehand to the British envoyto agree to furnishing material assistance to the Tibetan Govern-ment, and the application should only be considered if and when ita:&quot;is ss :(c) If the application is made at atime vhen the Cabinet is holdingregular Meetings.,  the Secretaryof State should bring the matter before them.:(d) If it should arise (as seems probable)  during the Recess, theSecretary of State should givea temporizing and not unfavourablereply 0

During the discussion which forms theAND ammunition to FORFIGN subject of the preceding Minute, the suggestionCOUNTRIES.was made that the policy of the Government in(Previous regard to the export of war material ought to reference:- Cabinet 31 re-examined, more particularly from the point of(30),  Con-clusion 15.)       view of Unemployment.    It was pointed out thatthe orders which British firms are not allowed toaccept are carried out by armament firms abroad.Meanwhile the British firms have to be subsidisedto keep them in existence in the interests ofImperial defence.The Prime Minister said, that the Cabinet wouldbe glad to consider any reports on the workingsof the present policy which the Departments con-cerned might &quot;rrrnish.-IB-
8 . The Cabinet had before their, the following documents relating to the general control ofBritish relations with territories in the middle east:-A Note by the Secretary  (CP ,-252(30)) covering a Report of theCommittee of Imperial defence sub-Committee, which had been before the Cabinet at their previous Meeting:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (CP .-276 (30))in regard to the points which hadbeen reserved by the Cabinet.As regards the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, Part I (a),Conclusion (h), the Secretary of State saw noobjection to acceptance of the Sub-Committee&apos;srecommendations.   As regards the Report of theSub-Committee, Part I (b), Conclusion (i), theSecretary of State had not had time to considerthe recommendations relating to the appointmentof the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf inconsultation with the Government of India, but expressed his own views to the effect that theappointment is already sufficiently attractivefrom the aspect of prestige and remuneration:that nothing was to be gained by extending thelimits of the present field of selection;    anddoubting whether it is necessary to associate theImperial Government, who have already in practicean opportunity of expressing their views before an Officer is posted to Bushire, more closely with this appointment.   As regards Part II of theReport, which had been dealt with by the cabinet at the previous Meeting, the Secretary of Statenoted that the recommendations are of more immediate concern to the Foreign Office and
Colonial Office than to himself, but consideredthat the arguments in favour of avoiding fundamental changes now and postponing the decision until 1932,or such date as our Mandate in Iraq may terminate,were strong.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve para.17 (h) of theBub-Committee&apos;s Report, whichis as follows:-&quot;The Resident, Persian Gulf,should,  in view of the growingimportance of the Arab littoral,have his headquarters, if possible,on the Arab and not on the Persianside of the Gulf&quot; .(b) To take note of the Secretaryof State for India&apos;s observationsin regard to the appointment ofa Resident in the Persian Gulf.

The effeot of the arrangement proposed inthe Report, which woiild save upwards of  5^,000capital expenditure and was datisfactory to all theDepartments and interests concerned, was as follows:-(a) The garri3on of the Sudan will bereduced, for the time being, to 1squadron R.ABF, and 2 battalionsless 1 oompany.   Under presentconditions we are satisfied, thatthis force is sufficient fardefence purposes;   while it wouldbe possible, in a crisis, to sendback the absent company withoutthe political reactions which thesScspatoh of a full battalion wouldinvolve:(b) The garrison of Egypt will consistof the same number of battalions as before;    but one, which has hitherto been short of ene company, willhenceforth be at full strength.   Herealso we are of opinion that no political reaction need be fearediThe Cabinet approved theabove arrangements .
10.The Cabinet had before them a Report &quot;bythe Cabinet Committee on the Economic Cansequenoes -of Disarmament (CP.-SSI (30)), the cone Ins ions ofwhich, are summarised in the last paragraph ef theReport as follows:-(l) we cannot recommend the Cabinet to entertain the suggestion that pre-, fe^erioe under the Colonial Develop-ment Grant procedure should begiven to districts affected bythe Disarmament polioy.(2) Further action with rogari ts theproposal for s&apos;timiulating trade withRussia must await the result of the test  case to be submitted to theExport Credits Advisory Committee.We suggost that the Chancellor ofthe Exthequer should be invited togive sympathetic consideration toa suggestion that the osnditions,   of the Scheme should be re-examined.(3) No further action is required regard-ing the proposal that the sale ofeld British tonnage to foreignersshould be prevented pending theReport ef the Board of trade committee,(4) The present position with regard to merchant Shipping in the Royal Dock-yards as indicated in paragraph 13might be communicated to the JointCommittee,(5) The Chancellor of the Exchequer hasrecently informed a Deputation fromthe Trado Union Congress general council that Trade Facilitiescannot be revived for shipbuilding .but that if the circumstances alter the question will be re-examined.(6)  :Vith regard ti &quot;monetary compensa-tion&quot;, we are unable te recommend the Cabinet to entertain the pro-posal that the existing terms andconditions on which State employeesfwhether established or unestab-lished) are eligible for compensa-tion on abolition of office shouldbe modified in the manner proposedby the Joint Committee.   As regardsthat Committee&apos;s suggestion that special grants supplementary&quot;to thenormal grants payable for reliefworks should be paid to the LocalAuthorities to finance schemes forworkpeople displaced by the closing of establishments as a result of theDisarmament Policy we refer to the observations contained in paragraph 31.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the Conclu-sions of the Cabinet Cobeioitteeas set forth in CP.-261 (30)and quoted above:(b) That in regard to conclusion (2)above, the President of theBoard of Trade should have authority to let the Chairmanof the Export Credits AdvisoryCommittee know that the Govern-it ent would be willing that theCommittee should considerwhether,  in the case of anyreally large orders,  it mightbe useful to extend the period,of the credit from 12 to 18months .    In doing so thePresident of the Board of trade should, be careful to make itclear that the Committee retainsin full its powers of judgingeach application from an economicstandpoint and that there is no desire on the part of the Govern-ment to exercise any political influence on their decision.The President of the Board ofTrade was also asked, to bear inmind that the period must not beso lengthened as to be tantamount to a loan.

The MoMahon       the Secretary of State for the Colonies  (CP.-271Oorrespondenee.(30)) raising for decision the question of thepublication of the correspondence which paooedbetween Sir H. WcMahon and the Sherif Husein ofMecca in 1915-1916, pressure in favour of whichhas recently been renewed.After reviewing the correspondence, excerptsof which were annexed, to his Memorandum,  theSecretary of State proposed that, in reply to aQuestion,  a short statement on the subject shouldbe made in Parliament to the following effect:-&quot;Kis Majesty&apos;s Government have been impressed by the feeling shown in theHouse of Commons on various occasions,and especially in the debate on the adjournment on the 7th May, with regardto the correspondence which took placein 1915-16 between Sir Henry McT/ahonand the Sherif Husein of Mecca.    Theyhave, therefore, thought it necessaryto re-examine this correspondence fully in the light of the history of theperiod and the interpretations whichhave been put upon it.There are still valid reasons,entirely unconnected with the questionof Palestine, which render it in thehighest degree undesirable in thepublic interest to publish the corres-pondence.    These reasons may be expectedto retain their foroe for many years tocome.There are not sufficient grounds for holding that by this correspondenceHis Ma j es t y 1 y G ov er nr.&quot; ent int end e d topledge themselves, c did, in fact,pledge their-s elves , to the inclusionof Palestino in the projected arab state.    Sir H. McMahon has himsel&apos;rdenied that this was his intention.The ambiguous and inconclusive natureof the correspondence may well, however,have left an impression among thosewho were aware of the correspondencethat His Majesty&apos;s Government had such an intention.&quot;
The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for theColonies, as set forth above, butit was suggested that perhaps the answer to the Question might beabbreviated .

NEXT MEETING OF 19.iCABINET.2, *hitehall Gardens , S .&quot;&quot;. 1,July SO, 19 30.To meet the same evening at p pis., to complete the agenda paper.
APPENDIX.The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.August 1st, 1930.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.It has given Me great pleasure to welcome in My capital Their ImperialHighnesses Prince and Princess Takamatsu, and to learn from His Imperial High-ness of the gratification which the Emperor of Japan derived from the visit of Myson, the Duke of Gloucester, to Japan last year to convey to His Imperial majesty the insignia of the Order of the Garter.At the Conference held at The Hague last January Agreements were concludedfor the definite settlement of the reparation liabilities of Germany, Austria,Hungary and Bulgaria. These Agreements, together with that subsequentlyconcluded at Paris, solved a number of difficult and delicate problems which haveimpeded the political as well as the financial progress of Europe; and their conclusion enabled the evacuation of the Rhineland by the Armies of Occupation tobe completed on the 30th June last. The Hague Conference thus marks a decisivestage in the financial reconstruction and political tranquillisation of Europe and its success has given Me profound satisfaction.In January it afforded Me great pleasure to open at Westminster aninternational conference for the limitation and reduction of naval armaments.After three months of deliberation a Treaty embodying many important points ofagreement in regard to the principles of naval limitation and achieving effectiveeconomies in the sphere of naval armaments was signed by representatives of theUnited States of America, France, Italy and Japan and of My Governments in theUnited Kingdom, the Dominions and India. In addition the Treaty embodies anagreement between My Governments and those of the United States of America and japan fixing for a period a total tonnage limit for certain categories of warships.In this agreement the representatives of France and Italy were unable at the time ofthe signature of the Treaty to participate. The Conference was accordinglyadjourned so as to give further time for negotiations, and these will, I trust, resultin a full agreement at no very distant date.The Optional Clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice was signed at Geneva in September last in respect of the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, My self-governing Dominions and India,and the several instruments of ratification are now completed or nearing completion.In October last the Prime Minister visited Washington for the purpose of an informal discussion with the President of the United States upon various questionsbearing on the peace of the world and an international agreement regardingreduction and limitation of naval armaments. Subsequently the Prime Minister&apos; visited Ottawa. The very cordial manner in which he was received caused Me theliveliest satisfaction.A mission under the Chairmanship of Viscount D&apos;Abernon was appointed in1929 to consider Anglo-Argentine and Anglo-Brazilian relations, industrial, com-mercial and financial, with a view to their development to the mutual advantage ofthe countries respectively concerned.(21470)
The failure of the recent negotiations for an Anglo-Egyptian settlementoccasioned Me sincere disappointment, but I hope that a successful conclusion may^soon be reached.Diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were resumed in December last, and placed on a normal basis by the appointment of Ambassadors.I am happy to say that the restoration of more settled conditions in Afghanistanhas enabled Me to accredit a Minister to His Majesty King Nadir Shan, and toreceive a representative of His Majesty in My capital.A new Treaty of Alliance between Myself and His Majesty the King of Iraq toregulate the future relations between Our two countries, has been signed by our respective representatives.   The text of this Treaty has been laid before you.I am glad that arrangements have been made for a meeting of the ImperialConference in London at the end of September. I welcome the opportunities afforded by such meetings between the representatives of My several Governments for the promotion of mutual understanding and of co-operation in all matters of common concern. The Expert Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation which met in London last year presented a Report which will come before the ImperialConference for consideration.In accordance with an Address to Me from the Senate and Commons of Canada,the British North America Act, 1930, has been passed for the purpose of confirmingand validating certain agreements entered into between My Government in canada and the Governments of the Provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta andSaskatchewan.A Conference attended by Governors and other senior officials from the Colonies,Protectorates and Mandated Territories assembled in June to discuss matters ofcommon interest to the various territories of the Colonial Empire.During the Session the Commission appointed by Me in pursuance of theprovisions of the Government of India Act have completed their arduous duty andhave submitted to Me their Report, which has been presented to both your Houses.My Government will shortly be approaching the task of framing and submittingfor your consideration proposals for the future government of India. For guidance in this matter, it is their intention to summon into conference in London represen-tatives of the wide variety of interests in India. I earnestly pray that a spirit of mutual trust and friendship may unite all races and creeds in India, and therepresentatives of both countries, in their discharge of the responsibilities which theConference will impose upon them; and I am confident that the single purpose of promoting the welfare of My Indian people will be the inspiration of every memberof the Conference.Members of the House of Commons,I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,The high level to which unemployment has risen during the past year and the (world-wide depression in trade is causing Me very grave anxiety. Measures havebeen passed with the object of promoting works of economic development in thiscountry and in My Overseas Dependencies. It is encouraging to find that scheme shave been designed to provide useful employment in works of public utility of atotal value of over  100,000,000. This has been made possible by a substantial contribution granted by My Government.
I have given My assent to a further Measure to facilitate more speedy executionifpof works of this character by local authorities and other bodies.Reports have been received on the enquiries undertaken into the condition ofthe iron and steel and cotton industries in order to discover means of improving their position in the markets of the world, and discussion of the recommendations made is actively proceeding between all the interests concerned.A Bill has been passed which amends the Unemployment Insurance Scheme in several important respects, and other legislative measures have been necessary toprovide for the heavy expenditure on unemployment benefit occasioned by the greatvolume of unemployment.I have given My assent to a Measure for ameliorating the conditions of minersby reducing their hours of labour and for effecting an improvement in theorganisation of the mining industry.A Measure, based generally on the recommendations of My Commission on land drainage, has been passed to enable essential comprehensive drainage works to beundertaken for the prevention of flooding and the consequent benefit of agriculture,and the increase of employment in rural areas.Acts have also been passed to make further provision with respect to the drainage of agricultural land in Scotland and to provide additional monies for improving medical service in the Highlands and Islands.Steps are being taken to appoint an Agricultural Research Council, and withthis purpose in view a Committee of the Privy Council has been appointed.I have given My assent to Measures to facilitate the clearance and preventionof slums and the provision of better housing accommodation, both in urban and rural areas in Great Britain.It is My earnest hope that these Measures will improve the unsatisfactoryconditions under which so many of My people dwell.I have given My assent to a Bill which modifies the conditions applicable tocertain pensions under the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory pensions act, 1925, and brings some new classes of persons within the benefits of the Act; toa Measure designed to improve and extend the facilities for the treatment of mental illness,; and also to a Bill amending and consolidating the law relating to the regulation and control of motor vehicles.In bidding you farewell, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon the work which you have completed.
