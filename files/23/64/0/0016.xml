INDIA.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(30), C on-clusion 14.)1.   The Prime Minister said that he had suggested to Mr Baldwin that the latter should put down a Question, addressed to the PrimeMinister, in regard to the Report of the IndianStatutory Commission, and he hims-elf should replymaking clearer than hitherto the position of theGovernment towards the round-tablo Conference.He had not yet received Mr Baldwin&apos;s reply, but hehad just learned that Mr Baldwin wished to see him the same afternoon.   The precedents had now beenlooked into, and there was no case for moving anyvote of thanks or formal recognition of the workof the Indian Statutory Commission,,   Moreover, the officials of the House of Commons were very muchopposed to establishing such a precedent.The Cabinet were informed that the Librarianof the House of Lords took the same view as regardsprecedents.The Prime Minister asked the Cabinet to agree,therefore, that no Resolution of Thanks should be4moved,  and his proposal was adopted.The Prime Minister said that in the past ithad been usual for a spokesman of the Governmentto express thanks to a Commission of this kindin a speech on a Motion for Adjournment,   As theCabinet were agreed that it was undesirable to havea Debate, he proposed to try and arrange toexpress thanks to the Commission by means of an answer to a Question in Parliament, in which hewould try to secure that Mr Baldwin and Mr Lloyd -George would associate themselves.   He then read to the Cabinet two alternative drafts of an answer to a Question,, not only thanking the
Commission but also stating the general attitude ofthe Government towards the Round Table Conference.After discussion,  the Cabinet agreed -(a) That there should be no resolution of Thanks to the Indian statutory commission:(b) That the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for India should try and arrange with the Leaders ofthe Parliamentary Opposition thatthe Prime Minister, in reply to aQuestion to be put by one of thesaid Leaders,  should make a statement with which the Leaders of the twoOpposition Parties would associatethems elves:(c) That the Prime Minister should try and secure the agreement of theLeaders of the Opposition to thestatement attached in the Appendix:(d) That the Secretary of State for india should circulate a Memorandum, regardingthe United Kingdom representation atthe round-table Conference,  in whichhe should state the pro&apos;s and con&apos;sof including members outside of theGov ernment.
2.    The Cabinet resumed the discussion on theResolution standing in the name of Mr. Baldwin andMr. Neville Chamberlain on the subject of Safe-grarding policy and Empire Markets (the text ofwhich is given in the Conclusions of the meeting mentioned in the margin),      The following draftamendment, prepared by the President of the Boardof Trade, was handed round and discussed indetaili-&quot;That this House, believing that a return toprosperity can best be promoted by the fullestexpansion of trade and the reorganisation of basic industries., welcomes the opportunity provided bythe coming Imperial Conference to promote all practicable measures for closer economic co-operation within the Empire,  refuses to denounce international agreements which haveassured valuable advantages to our foreigncommerce, and refuses to adopt the policy rejected by the electorate of taxing the necessaries of life and the raw materials of our manufacturers and thus depressing the real wages of the workers&quot;After discussion,  the President of theBoard of Trade undertook to make further enquiries on whether Governments amendedvotes of censure upon themselves, and&quot;theCabinet agreed  To adjourn the discussion until2.J0 p,m,  on the following afternoon.   --3-    and   -if-

APPENDIX.I take the first opportunity of expressing the thanks of the Rouse to the Chairman and Membersof the Statutory Commission who have with such assiduitand thoroughness enquired into the problems of indian government, and of congratulating them upon a report which, in its breadth of survey and excellence of presentation, will, I am sure, secure an abiding placeamongst the great State Papers of our time.The functions and task of the Commission wereaptly described by its distinguished Chairman in thefollowing words:- &quot;No-one should regard the statutory commission or its colleagues as though we were settlingand deciding the Constitution of British India.   our task is very important, but it is not that.    Our taskis that of making a fair, honest and sympatheticreport to the Imperial Parliament.   When we have made our report, then it would be India&apos;s opportunity tomake her full contribution, which is right and neces-sary, to her future Constitution, which would be framed by Great Britain and India together&quot;.The Conference, for which preparations must now be made, will be free and unfettered, and therepresentatives of India may be assured that theBritish representatives whom they will meet will be guided by the declaration made by the Viceroy last november and repeated in his speech at the opening of-the Indian Legislature this week.   In the course ofthe deliberations of the Conference, the advice given and proposals made by the Commission and the represent-atives of India will be fully considered, with asincere desire to come to conclusions which will leadto harmonious co-operation with India and secure herinternal stability and progress.
