In this Memorandum, theSecretary of State reminded the Cabinet that theViceroy, in letters exchanged between him andSir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr Jayakar, had authorised a visit to the Congress leaders whoare in prison, and stated that it was highly&apos;probable that within the next few days theseemissaries would make known to the Viceroy on what terms,  i^ any, the Congress would be preparedto abandon the civil disobedience movement and either themselves participate, or countenance the participation of others, in the Round-table conference.    This would present an issue of first class importance,   and on the decision reachedthe whole bourse of future events in India mightdepend.   After giving details o^ recent develop-ments in the situation, the Sc&amp;retary  of Stateadded that in making a decision on any offer which the Congress might tender,  the Governmentfaced the risk of severe criticism due to theignorance of British public opinion as to the-realsituation in India, and. expressed his belief asto the need of securing peace.   Attached as appendices to the Memorandum were copies of letters passed between the Viceroy and Mr Jayakar,Sir Tei Bahadur Sapru, and Sir Frederick Sykes,the Governor of Bombay.is Conclusion was ae-tually reached at the previousThe Cabinet took note of the  ab ov e.but by an oversight(Intd) CP.P.A.H.

Golipjn, aDutch Minister, had taken the iniative.      Itwas recognised that discussion of the possibilityof a restriction of output was likely to ariseat the Conference, but this was not deemedobjectionable, provided that the conference was not confined, to that one subject.      Theimportance&apos; of securing the representation ofthe United States of ^merica at any international conference to consider the sugar position was emphasised.The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the President of theBoard of Trade to co-operate withMr. Colijn in promoting anInternational Conference to considerthe sugar position, on theunderstanding that the cabinet should be consulted before thescope of the Conference is finally agreed toi

In these circumstances the Secretaryof State suggested that Pis Majesty&apos;s representa-tives in the countries  of all the former allied and associated Powers should be instructed to address the Governments to which they are accredited officially proposing that the practice be discontinued from next Armistice Day,.   Hesuggested also that, out of courtesy,  ex-enemy countries should be informed at the same time.A dra^t of the despatch to be sen4&quot; to His Majesty1 representatives was attached.The Cabinet took note of and approved the proposal of theSecretary of Grate fcr ForeignAffairs.

TheAdmiralty attached importance to the exclusion ofthe Navy from this particular Article.    It wacpointed out,, however, that the Article was eoworded as to render it very unlikely that it couldbe applied to naval forces.The Cabinet agreed  . To approve CP .-279  (30)  and cp.-279-A (30)  (Aouendax) onthe understanding that theremust be no doubt that the first paragraph of proposal &quot;B&quot; to article 2 of the Model Treatydoes .not apply to naval forces,-10-

The Prime Minister reported that thedecision announced in both Houses of parliament the same day bearing on the proposed participation in the Indian Round Table Conference of theChairman of the Indian Statutory Commission,(the Right Honour-able Sir John Simon), had evokedsome criticism, and it was not improbable that,if the Speaker permitted, the adjournment of theHouse of Commons would be moved.      He would himself ascertain from the Speaker whether this/ould be in order.      He himself must unavoidablybe absent abroad if and when the question was soraised, and in the circumstances he would leavethe matter to be dealt with by the Secretaryof State for India and the Chancellor of theExchequer, who would be leading the House ofCommons.The Cabinet agreed --  &apos;That they would stand by their previous decision (referred toin the margin)  that the Chairmanof the Statutory/ Commission ought not to be a Delegate at the RoundTable Conference.

The statement was only handed round after the Cabinet had assembled.In view of the provisional  characterof the Cabinet decisions on which the draft statement was based, and the lack of opportunity to study it,  the discussion was necessarily of a preliminary character.Certain amendments were made in the draft,and paragraph 6, dealing with wheat andcereal farming, in which a reference wasmade to import boards, was felt to gorather beyond any decision which had yet beentaken by the Cabinet.In these circumstances, and in theabsence of at least one Member of the cabinet who is &quot;particularly interested, in thisCjueetion, the Cabinet, while recognising thedesirability of announcing at least a partof the government&apos;s agricultural policy beforethe Recess,  if practicable, agreed  (a) To consider the matter furtherat a special meeting to be heldon the following day at noon;(b) That the following Cabinet Ministers:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The Secretary of State forScotland,The   Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,should meet the same evening at  .p0 p.m, in order to examine andrevise the statement forconsideration by the Cabinet.

Meeting was not possible, the Prime minister agreed that the Secretary of &quot;State for Foreign Affairs should.......arrange for a conference between the three Service Ministers,their Chiefs of Staff and Lord Cecil, with a view to framingdefinite Recommendations:    this meeting was held on July 24th,and the conclusions are attached to this note.2. The instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation atGeneva regarding their attitude to the Model Treaty form the.subject of a Cabinet Conclusion in May (Cabinet 29 (30) Conclusion 2)and, as the Recommendations suggested by Mr. Henderson&apos;sCommittee involve amendments to this Conclusion and necessitateofficial instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation at theforthcoming Geneva Session,  the Prime Minister desires the matter to be brought before the Cabinet again for final approval.3.

possibility of questions being raised should we require to despatch air reinforcements to or through Iraq or some other country with whichwe had an alliance.     The use of the word&quot;invaded&quot; precludes any such possibility.(b) The insertion of the word &quot;land&quot; before &quot;forces&quot;has been suggested at the instigation of theAdmiralty, who were apprehensive that, under thisArticle, it would be open to the League to issue orders regarding the movements and dispositions ofour Fleet.       The insertion of the word &quot;land&quot;expressly excludes naval forces from the provisionsof this Article.    If this amendment is agreed to atGeneva by other countries, it will be necessary toindicate in some mariner, which cam, I think, beleft to our Delegation, that the expression &quot;land forces&quot; includes air forces co-operating with theixu(c) The third Recommendation wao put forward byLord Cecil, and is merely to the effect that theLeague,  in ordering forces which have invaded another state to be withdrawn, shall at the came time indicate a line behind which the forces should be withdrawn.This proposal was accepted by the War Office, subjectto a safeguard that we should not be asked towithdraw behind the exterior limits of any defenceorganisations of such a kind as exist on the North-West Frontier of India,      Lord Cecil has undertaken to submit a redraft of the Clause in question.This proposal therefore, can only be approved inprinciple, since the new Article is not yet ready.(Signed) M.P.A.HANKEY.Secretary to the Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.29th July, 1930.
