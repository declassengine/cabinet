THE TARIFF-.TRUCE.ratification of.(previous reference erence:Cabinet 33(30),  Con-clusion 12.)1.    The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the President of the Board of Tradein regard to the proposed Tariff Truce:-A draft reply to a Questionnairecirculated by the Secretariat tothe League of Nations (CP.-284 (30))the answers to which were to be thebasis of further negotiations totake place in regard to reductionof tariffs and other obstacles totrade.    In this Memorandum thePresident of the Board of Tradeasked for the authority of hiscolleagues to make proposalsgenerally on the lines suggested,subject to the approval of theChancellor of the Exchequer and toany modifications that he might require.A further Memorandum (CP.-285 (30))proposing that the Commerrcial Con-vention concluded at Geneva on the24th March should nov: be ratified,or, alternatively, that the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade shouldbe authorised to announce to theAssembly of the League in Septemberthat it will be ratified before thelatest date for ratification, namely,November 1st of this year.The President of the Board of Trade elaboratedthe arguments-used in his Memoranda in favour of ratification.    He pointed out that the reasons which had actuated the Cabinet in their previous decision (referred to in the margin) to delayratification for the present, no longer held good,since he gathered that no-one proposed now to puton a tariff in connection with Agriculture o-&quot;anything else.    It would be very difficult at theAssembly of the League to have to admit that theGovernment of the United Kingdom did not intend to ratify a Convention which they themselves had beeninstrumental in promoting.     Moreover, such an admission would bring to a standstill the forth-coming important negotiations, for example, inregard to textiles and machinery, and would destroy-1-
the whole policy.    If, however, the negotiations were found unlikely to lead to any result, the ratification could be cancelled by giving notice in February.In the course of the discussion it was urgedthat, whether from the point of view of Agricultureand industry in this country,  or from that of thecoming Imperial Conference, it would be unwise inSeptember to announce the Government&apos;s intentionto ratify.    It was further suggested that,  in view^ probable difficulties in connection with thenext Budget,  it would be inadvisable to ratify theConvention, since ratification would have the effectof ruling out a tariff even for purely revenuepurposes, and in some quarters the deduction wouldbe made that an increase of direct taxation was contemplated.   This would exercise a furtherdepressing effect on       industry which was alreadysuffering from pessimism,  and would have a badpsychological influence.    The proposal was made that a wiser course would be to point out to theother countries concerned&quot;that, since this Conventionhad first been discussed, their attitude had notbeen such as to encourage the belief that they wrereacting towards this country in the spirit of theConvention.    On the contrary, instances could begiven to show that the trade of this country hadbeen attacked by many means, not necessarily by increases in tariffs so much as by dumping, choosingthis moment for taking advantage of ad valoremfacilities,  etc.    The suggestion was that thePresident of the Board of Trade should be quitefrank in regard to this aspect of the question
and should ask for the negotiations to be enteredupon at once,  in orde-- that, before ratifying,he might satisfy himself that the other nationsconcerned intended in future to act in the spiritof the Convention.After considerable discussion  (a) The Prime Minister summed up tothe effect that, in the view ofthe majority of those present,it would be inadvisable to ratify the Convention or to announce any intention to ratify it until theprobable result of the negotiations could be forecast.   He asked thePresident o&quot;^ the Board o^ Tradeto try and work out his policy at Geneva on the ass unapt ion thatthis was the view of the Cabinet.If, however, he should deem somere-consideration of this policy to be essential before proceeding to Geneva, he should communicateon the subject again with thePrime minister-% with a view to some further consultation:(b) The Cabinet approved the draft reply contained in CP.-284 ( 30)to the League of Nations Question-naire,  subject to the approval ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequerand. to any modifications he may require.
