(COOEGYPT(previous reference:Cabinet 35(50), Con-elusion 1.)1. The Cabinet took note of a verbal statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to the effect that the Egyptian Government wishedto appoint, and had asked for an&quot;agr ement&quot; to, anew Chargd d&apos;Affaires in London,   His policy hadbeen to postpone the appointment in the hope thata turn in events might lead to the conclusion of aTreaty, in which case the diplomatic representationof Egypt would take a new form .   But the EgyptianLegation had for some considerable time been incharge of a very junior official, and the HighCommissioner had satisfied him that the post could not longer be kept vacant .
INDIA. 2. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the proposed Address of the(previous0   Reference: Governor-General to the Indian Assembly on JulyCabinet 55(30), Con- 9th, 1930,  dealing with the scope of the forth-conclusion 10.)coming Conference:-Two telegrams from the Viceroy,both dated July 3rd,  circulatedby the Secretary of State forIndia (CP.-230 (30)), in thefirst of which, after consideringthe attitude of the Leaders ofthe Opposition Parties in Parlia-ment, Lord Irwin reaches theconclusion that the best coursewill be to give up the idea of aStatement in Parliament and for him, in his speech on the 9th, torefer to the following three points:-1. That the Statement of last november, about Dominion .status, stands:2o That the Conference will beunfettered by the Simon Report:and3. That any agreement reached at the Conference by therepresentatives of GreatBritain and India will bethe basis of the Government&apos;sproposals to Parliament.The second telegram contains an outline of the political part ofthe Viceroy&apos;s proposed Addresson July 9th. conceived on theabove lines, and making clearthat the Conference will enjoy the full freedom indicated inhis statement of November 1stlast:    that it will be free to pursue its task greatly assistedbut with liberty unimpaired by theReport of the Statutory commissioner by any other documents which  /ill be before it; and that thediscussions will represent a genuine attempt to reach agree-ment on these difficult mattersamongst those who will speakrespectively for Great Britainand for India:Copies of further telegramscirculated by the Secretary ofStat e for India (C.P.^230*A)iin the first of which, dated july 4, the Viceroy asks for a
repl;/ by Saturday, July 5,  andin the second of which, alsodated July 4, the Secretary ofState for India states that hehas shown the Viceroy&apos;s telegramsreferred to above to the PrivieMinister, that they&quot; consider theoutline of his Address admirable,that they have no suggestion tomake and approve the course theViceroy has adopted;    that thewhole question will be laid beforethe Cabinet on the evening ofMonday, July 7, but in the meantimethat the Viceroy may proceed onthe foregoing approval:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (C.P.-S26 (SO))covering a copy of a letter fromSir Frederick Sykes, the governor of Bombay   addressed to the Viceroy.The Secretary of State for India made astatement regarding the course of events sincethe subject was last discussed at the Cabinet,including his and the Prime Minister&apos;s consulta-tions with the Leaders of the parliamentary opposition Parties.    The Cabinet were informedthat,  in various communications to the Viceroy,including those in which the views of theParliamentary Opposition had been transmitted inorder to keep him fully conversant with theParliamentary aspects of the situation,  it hadbeen made clear consistently that he had thefull support of the Government .The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefollowing phrase in the Viceroy&apos;s draft Statement(telegram No .586-S):-&quot;It was for this reason and with theobject of removing avoidable mis-understanding on this vital matter,that His Majesty&apos;s Government lastyear authorised me to declare, inurn: istakeable terms, that in their view nothing less than such equality of status with the other Dominionswas the natural completion ofIndia&apos;s constitutional growth&quot;.
It was pointed out that the use of the words&quot;other Dominions&quot; might be objected to by theDominions  on the ground that it implied that india either already possessed or was about to beadmitted to equality of status, a matter in whichthe Dominions clearly had a claim to be consulted,and on which, at the appropriate moment, theywould have to be consulted.   There was generalagreement that it would be advisable for theViceroy to use a phrase following more closely the language of his Statement on November 1st, 1929, -&quot;that the natural issue of India&apos;s constitutional&quot;progress   ..... 0. . is the attainment of Dominion&quot;status&quot;, notwithstanding that the use of thelatter term was understood to be objected to bysome of the leaders of the Parliamentary Opposition.Towards the end of the Meeting the PrimeMinister indicated that a special Meeting of theCabinet would have to be held before the Recessin order to formulate the policy of the government towards the Conference, and that such questions asthe following would have to be considered:-   themachinery of the Conference:    the composition ofthe British Delegation;   whether persons outsidethe Government should be included therein;   whetherthe system of demoerabic government was to beapplied to the Indian central Government:    orwhether, as suggested in the Report of theStatutory Commission, that system should beapplied in the first instance only to the Pro-vine ial Governments; whether plans such as the&quot;Nehru&quot; proposals would, if handed in at theConference, be treated On an equality with the
Report of the statute ^u Commission, and so forth the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the terms ofthe proposed Statement containedin the Viceroy&apos;s private and personal telegram No.586-S,subject to:-(b) The substitution in paragraph 2for the words &quot;such equality ofstatus with the other Dominions&quot;of some such phrase as  &quot;the attain-ment of Dominion status&quot;:(g) That the Secretary of State forIndia should communicate these decisions to the Viceroy,together with a general indication of the Cabinet&apos;s attitude of sympathy and support:(d) That a Special Meeting of theCabinet should be held withinthe next week, or two to discussthe forthcoming Conference, andthat the Secretary of State forIndia should be invited to circulate material for thedis cussion.-5-
ICELAND.       &apos; 3.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he had received a protest from some of themembers of both Houses who had visited Icelandas representatives of the British Parliament atthe recent celebrations regarding the lack of official organisation on that occasion.   Therepresentatives had made enquiries and had beengiven to understand that ceremonial dress was unnecessary, though they were conveyed on boardH.M.S. RODNEY.    On arrival, however, they foundthat many other nations were represented and thatceremonial dress was worn, and of those nations the United Kingdom was the only one whose delegates were not provided with some national present.   ThePrime Minister thought it probable that he would find it necessary to communicate further with theCabinet on the subject.-6-
EMPIRE FREE 4. At the conclusion of the Cabinet Meeting,TRADE.after some members had withdrawn, the umpire free trade -movement was briefly referred to, and it wassuggested that, before the Parliamentary Recess,the Cabinet ought to discuss the matter and formu-lat e its policy .2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 7, 1930.
