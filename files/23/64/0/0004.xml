1. In the absence, of the-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and for the Colonies reportedthat he and his colleagues on the CabinetCommittee had settled the details of the white paper, but, in view, of the return of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on thefollowing Monday, they had decided to keepback publication until that day, in order togive the Secretary of State a final opportunityto revise it.   The only risk in this procedure was that conceivably the Egyptian Delegation,who were also due back in Egypt on Monday next^might possibly anticipate the publication ofour White Paper.
rj oINDIA.Situation in.Suggested Useof Tear Gas .(previous reference!Cabinet 24(50) , -Con-elusion 4.)FT2. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (Paper C.P.-153 (30)) as to the use of Tear Gas in the dispersal of mobs.   The conclusion of theSecretary of State was that the use of such a&apos;weapon as tear gas would produce a strength of moral disapprobation which, whether justified on technical grounds or not, provided a final argu-ment against its employment.   He therefore pro-posed to answer the Questions to be asked inParliament on the matter by saying that it hadbeen considered and the Government declined tomake use of this weapon.The Cabinet agreed  -That the Secretary of Stat7e forIndia should, if possible, arrange that the proposed Questions shouldnot be put, but, if the questionersinsisted, should reply as proposedin his Memorandum and summarised above. .
3. The Cabinet had before them the samedocuments as at the previous Meeting, namely,on the Statutory Q,upta of British Wheat inFlour, Papers C.P,-135 (30), CP.-139 (SO),CP..-142 (30), CP,-143 (30), and,  on theAgricultural Marketing Bill, Paper CP.-144 (30) .The Cabinet were informed that the PrimeMinister had conferred with the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary ofState for Scotland,and some of their Officials,on the subject of the Agricultural marketing bill, and the proposals made at that conference were being examined Departmentally.The question was raised, as a matter of urgencyas to what action, if any, should be taken asthe result of the proposal made in parliamentary debate on Monday, May 12th, by the Leader ofthe Liberal Party, for a consultation betweenthe three Parties, and the favourable reply madeto that proposal by the Government spokesman.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone the discussion on agricultural Policy until further progress had been made withMinisterial and Departmentaldiscussions oh the subject ofthe Agricultural.Marketing Bill;(b) That thePrime Minister should communicate with the Leader ofthe Liberal Party&apos; in regard tohis proposal for inter-Partyconsultation.
LAND VALUA- 4. The Cabinet had before-them the followingTION BILL.doonments :--(Previous A Note by the Chancellor of the reference: Exchequer (Paper C,P .-152 (30))Cabinet 28 covering a draft of the Land(24), Con- Valuation Bill, in which it waselusion l(e)o) stated that the present intention is to introduce the Bill onThursday, May 15th, and to takethe Second Reading on the follow-ing Wednesday,   It was indicated that a number of drafting altera-tions would be required beforethe Bill is finally introduced:A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (paper c.P.-157 (30)) urging that thebasis of &quot;land value&quot; as defined in the draft Bill needed substan-tial amendment in order that agricultural land may receiveat least as favourable treatment in respect of owners&apos; improvementsas is accorded to other land.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of the valuation of agricultural land, raised in theMemorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries, shouldbe discussed between the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries andthe President of the Board ofEducation, with the assistanceof the appropriate Officials:(b) That the Bill, in the form inwhich it emerges from the dis-cussions referred to in (a),should be referred to theCommittee of Home Affairs:(c) That the decision should be reserved for the present as tothe date of the Second reading debate on the Bill.
PALESTINE.Propos edStatementat thePermanentMandatesCommissionwith regardto british policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 18(SO),  Con-clusion 4.)5.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies(Paper CP.-151 (30)) covering a draft of aStatement with regard to British Policy inPalestine, which, subject to the approval ofthe Cabinet, it was proposed should be made bythe British representative at the permanent mandates Commission of the League of Nations.It was proposed that the text of the statement should be circulated in advance, if possible a fortnight before the meeting of the Commission,and that at the same time it should be published as a Parliamentary Paper.   In the Memorandumspecial attention was drawn to paragraph 4 deal-ing with Mr SnellTs reservations to the Reportof the Special Commission with regard to responsi-bility for the disturbances and for the innovations-tions introduced in the neighbourhood of theWailing Wall.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve generally the draft statement in regard to british policy in Palestine enclosedwith the Memorandum of theSecretary of State for theColonies (Paper CP,-151 (30))(b) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should have authorityto communicate the draft statement to the Mandates Commission of theLeague of Nations and to issue itas a Parliamentary Paper, subjectto his withholding it for two days to give the Prime Minister anopportunity to suggest finalcorrections if he should sodesire:(c) That the Secretary of State for&apos; the Colonies should consider thedesirability of including in its present form or, alterna-tively, of modifying the following passage in paragraph 7 of the st atement:-
nHis Majesty&apos;s Government desire,however, ta emphasise the point that the absence of any suchmeasure of self-government inPalestine is directly due tothe failure of the Arab repre-sentative leaders to takeadvantage of the opportunitiesthat have been offered them inthe past&quot;.
H Ot 0FRONTIERSETTLEMENTIN THEMIDDLE EASTSyria,Iraq and transjordan jor-dania.(previous reference:Cabinet 1?(30)   Con-clusion 2.)6.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum _by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(Paper C.P.-I50 (30)) proposing the adoption ofa suggestion made by His Majesty rs Ambassador inParis, in which.the French Government had agreed,that the question of the frontier between Syria,on the one hand, and Iraq and Trans Jordan on theother, which has long been in dispute, should bediscussed informally in Paris in June, when theFrench High Commissioner for Syria will be avail-able.    It was&apos; proposed that a member of theForeign Office, accompanied by a representativeof the Iraqi Government, together with local and other experts, should go to Paris for thispurpose.    It was stated in the Memorandum thatthe Iraqi Government concurred in this proposal,and that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was prepared to make the necessary arrangements.    It was further suggested that ifthe French Government should prove unwilling tonegotiate a general settlement of the frontieron satisfactory lines the British delegation should be given discretion to propose to theFrench Government that the whole matter shouldbe referred by agreement to the League of nations the Cabinet approved the above recommendations.
ALTERNATIVE 7&quot; The Cabinet had before them a Reportworn?: inORDNANCE (circulated by direction of the Prime Minister)factories and SIMILAR of an Inter-Departmental Committee under theGOVERNMENTESTABLISHMENTS . Chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary to theTreasury., addressed to the Chancellor of the(previous reference: Exchequer (Paper C.P.-L49 (30)), in regard to cabinet 10(30), Con- alternative work in ordnance factories and similarelusion 4.)Government establishments.   The conclusions are summarised in the last paragraph of the report as follows:-(1) The function of the OrdnanceFactories is to manufacturecertain warlike stores in peace-time and to be ready to expandto meet war requirements;   andany suggestions for &quot;alternative work&quot; should be considered withthis function in view.(ii) The &quot;nucleus&quot; establishment of.:work-people should be reviewed in the light of present military requirements *(iii) In view of (i) &quot;alternative work&quot;can be justified, if at all, only when normal work is insufficient for the nucleus under (ii), towhich the Ordnance Factories shouldbe reduced as soon as possible,(iv) Subject to the above, alternative work should be undertaken only where it helps to maintain andnot to impair emergenoy capacity,and only when all possibility ofeconomical transfer of normal work from the trade has been exhausted.But the problem of &quot;nucleus capacity&quot;arises in the trade also and must be faced.(v) Alternative work should be under-taken only w!ith definite orders insight.   A repetition of the loco-motives fiasco of 1921 should be avoided,(vi) Alternative work should be under-taken only when it can be done bythe Ordnance Factories at reasonablecost.   The diversion to the OrdnanceFactories of work whioh they can doonly at disprop.Ortionat e cost or byinstalling extensive plant is notonly expensive to the taxpayer anddetrimental to the true purpose of
the Factories, &quot;but is contraryto the general policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.in thedirection of rationalisation andamalgamation of industries.(vii) Detailed examination of the capacity of the OrdnanceFactories and the requirementsof public Departments showthat very little in the way ofsuitable &quot;alternative work&quot;is in fact available.(viii) The evidence shows that theprospects of attracting more normal work to the OrdnanceFactories would be improvedif they were put in a positionto quote &quot;firm prices&quot;.   We see no objection to this, providedthat the full cost were recoveredon the average, in the case ofGovernment customers not financed from Votes of Parliament.(ix) If &quot;alternative work&quot; became necessary, the adoption of&quot;firm prices&quot; would also help the Ordnance Factories to securesuch orders as were available.(x) Alternative work should beoosted in precisely the- same way as other work.   Thi3 isessential to the continuedefficiency of the OrdnanceFactories and to proper corn-par is on of their prices withthose of the trade.   Any loss(see (xi)below) should be speciallyrecorded for the information ofParliament and not absorbed inprices for normal work.(xi) With regard to the suggestionthat prices for alternative work might fairly be abatedin respect of &quot;standing charges&quot;,we find that a fair abatementfrom cost which might be madein this respect would be, on anaverage, 15 per cent.    Even withthis abatement, the OrdnanceFactories cannot usually competefor &quot;alternative work&quot; on aneconomic basis .(xii) The unsuitability of the OrdnanceFactories for alternative, work is not due to inefficiency ontheir part, but arises from their special circumstances and fromtheir efficiency for their properfunction.The Cabinet took note of the above recommenda-
The Secretary of State for War reportedto the Cabinet that he had been able to startwork at Woolwich Arsenal again on full time,with the same number of men as before.      no additional expenditure was involved.
THE! HAIRDRESSERS *AND BARBERS* SHOPS ,SUNBAY CLOSING,BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 25 (30),Conclusion 4.8..      The Cabinet agreed  That no opposition shouldbe offered by the government spokesman to the Hairdressers&apos;and Barbers&apos; Shops, SundayClosing, Bill,, which was comingup on Report Stage in theHouse of Commons on Friday,May 17th.
EDUCATION (-SCOTLAND) 9-    The Cabinet agreed -bill that the Government spokesman should adopt a favourableattitude towards the Education(Scotland) Bill, which is coming before the House ofCommons en Report Stage onFriday, May 2^rd,
The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forScotland should communicate withthe promoters of the SmallLandholders (Scotland.) Acts(1306-1919) Amendment Bill, witha view to securing certain amendments as a condition ofits being given government support, but should be careful &apos;to avoid any suggestion thatGovernment time could be found for the Bill if it should standon the Order Paper.
NAVAL PRO-GRAMME.Submarine&quot;Construction,(previous reference:Cabinet 2E(30), Con-elusion 1 ^)11.    The Prime Minister reported that at ameeting of the Fighting Services Committee on theprevious day it had been agreed that therewas no reason why the construction of the three submarines which were included by the Cabinetin the 1 929 programme,, but for which no provision was made in the 1930 Naval Estimatespending the results of the London naval conference,  should not be proceeded with andthat the fact should be announced in theHouse of Commons by Question and Answer.He instructed the Secretary to circulate the Report of the Fighting Services Committeeto the Cabinet.
