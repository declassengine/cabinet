The Cabinet continued the discussion inregard to the forthcoming Vote of Censure to be moved by Mr Baldwin and Mr Neville Chamberlain onthe subject of Empire Trade and Safeguarding ofIndustries.The President of the Board of Trade reportedto the Cabinet the results of his enquiries as tothe probable attitude of the Liberal Party duringthe Debate.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Government should not themselves put down any amendment to the resolution, nor should they arrange for an amendment tobe moved, but should meet theresolution with a direct negative:(b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be the first speaker onbehalf of the Government, and thatthe Prime Minister should wind upthe Debate.The President of the board-d of Tradeundertook to furnish material tothe Ministers concerned.

Secretary of State for DominionReference:Cabinet 39 Affairs by Sir Horace Wilson, on behalf of(30), Con-conclusion 3.) Officials who have been attending conferenceswith representatives of the Iron and Steelindustry, on the subject of measures of re-organisation: -&quot;In accordance with your instruc-tions, a meeting was held at theTreasury yesterday in continuanceof the Prime Minister&apos;a conference.Attached is a brief record of thediscussion.    It became increasinglyclear as the meeting proceededthat, in the opinion of thoserepresenting the Industry, no com-prehensive plan for the future organisation of the Industry could usefully be formulated until it isknown whether the plan should providefor the restricted output, which is all that can be hoped for in presentconditions, or whether provision should be made for expansion. Thelatter they consider possible only if conditions arise,  e.g., as aresult of some measure of restric-tion on importation, in which a market for an increased output canbe foreseen.    In a word, in their view the future organisation of theIndustry depends upon its market, anduntil the reactions of Safeguardinghave been fully explored and adecision reached on the question ofprinciple, no forecast of the extentof the future market can be made.Mr Ashley (who represented theBoard of Trade) and I would thereforeneed further instructions before wecould usefully meet the representa-tives of the Industry again.(Initialled) H.J.W.9.7.30.&quot;There was general agreement that the repre-sentatives of the Steel Industry were not justified in imposing this condition, which virtuallyamounted to an ultimatum, and that this oughtto be made clear to them.
The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should arrange to meet thevSub-Gome ittee,when he should inform them of thenature of the report that he hadreceived and aslc the representativesof the Industry to say what was intheir mind.   This would give himan opportunity to make it quite clear that no progress could bemade along these lines:    that theGovernment would have no alternative but to inform those who had been associated with them in promoting the Sub-Committee that this wasthe case:    and (if he deemedadvisable) that unless progress could be made on the lines originally contemplated the Government wouldhave to arrange for the appointmentof other representatives of theIndustry .
RUSSIA.(previous reference:- Cabinet 38W (30),  Con-clusion 5.)St owaw ays fromArchangel.6 0 03. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP .-237 (30)) asking, as amatter of urgency, the advice of his colleagues ona very difficult question which has arisen in regardto the disposal of certain stowaways from Archangelwho, on arrival here, have claimed to be escapedpolitical prisoners, and who state that if they arereturned to Russia they will be liable to be shot.On the other hand,  if the ship returns to Archangelwithout the stowaways the master, and perhaps the&apos;ship, will be liable to proceedings by the SovietGovernment, which, in the case of the master, might involve very serious consequences.The view of the Home Secretary was that weshould not require the stowaways to return to archangel when the ship sails on Saturday, but should grant them leave to land temporarily pendinginvestigation.   The circumstances should be explained to the Soviet authorities, and they should beinformed that the stowaways claim to be politicalrefugees, and that,  in view of the traditionalpolicy of this country to give consideration toany plea of this kind, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould not refuse their appeal without investigation.Consequently the Government felt that they had no alternative but to grant to these stowaways leave to land temporarily.   His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould, however, be prepared, on being informed ofthe facts, to consider any representations *hiohthe Soviet Government might wish to make.   T.. eMemorandum furf-er suggested that an official letter should also be sent, before the ship sails, to theowners or the ship,  in terms which would make itclear that the master wished to remove the stowaways
grant them leave to land temporarily pendinginvestigation of their claims.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to the risk, as mentioned in the HomeSecretary&apos;s Memorandum, that Soviet agents mightbe introduced through this channel, and it wassuggested that the Home Secretary should arrangefor the stowaways to be kept under observation.The Cabinet approved generally theproposal of the Home Secretary, as summarised above, but laid stress on the importance of an immediatecommunication being made to therepresentatives of Soviet Russia inLondon as to the temporary permit to the stowaways to land, with an intimation that the matter would betaken up through diplomatic channels.
9 o Q(COO4. The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinetthat he and the Secretary o^ State for India had discussed further with Mr Baldwin, Sir austen chamberlain, Mr Lloyd George and Lord Reading,the proposed Ansver in Parliament thanking theIndian Statutory Commission and setting forth theattitude of the Government towards the Round table conference.    The Opposition Leaders did not desirea Detate, but, owing to( the attitude of some oftheir supporters.,  found difficulty in avoiding it.They had suggested that a determining factor mightbe the adoption of acceptable arrangements inregard to United Kingdom representation at theConference.    In this connection they had made aproposal that the United Kingdom Delegation mightcontain representatives of all Parties.   Theiridea appeared to be that the Parliamentary repre-sentatives who were not members of the Governmentshould take up an attitude somewhat different fromthat of the Government representatives..    The objectof the former would be to ensure that., when discus-sion took place upon various proposals that might come before the Conference, all the points mentionedin the Report of the Statutory Commission were brought out in the debate.    This might involve a controversial attitude on their part which it mightnot be expedient for the Government representatives to assume.   Their suggestion was that the government representatives should adopt a somewhat judicialposition, eliciting all the facts and arguments,but avoiding  controversy as far as possible..The Opposition Leaders had not denied thatobjections would be raised by representatives ofone or other of the Indian interests to almost any
proposal that was likely to he made, but they had suggested that this might not be the case on allsubjects and that it was not desirable to leavethe controversial side of the Conference entirely to the Indian representatives.The Cabinet adjourned thequestion pending the ci-rou-lation of the Secretary ofState for India&apos;s Memorandum,on representation at the Oon-ference (See Conclusionsreferred to in.the margin)*2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 11, 19 30.
