documents relating, to the participation o^ theOpposition Parties in the j.T.ound-Table Conference:-A Note by the Secretary of Statefor India (C.P.-242-A (30))  cover-ing a telegram from the Secretaryof State to the Viceroy dated july 11,  19 30,  consulting him onthe point, together with theViceroy&apos;s reply, Wo .629-S,  dated july 14, which had only beenreceived at midday on the previous day:A Memorandum by the Secretary o^State for India (CP.-242 (30)),which it had only been possibleto prepare a^ter the receipt ofthe last-mentioned telegram, andwhich accordingly could only be handed round at the outset of tiieMeeting .In this latter Merorandm the Secretary of Stateset &quot;forth the pro&apos;s and con&apos;s of the participation of the Opposition Parties in the nound-table conference.    He suggested that, in order to allay the Viceroy&apos;s apprehensions as to the adverse effect on Indian Opinion of an announcement ofsuch participation,  correspondence should, bepublished for the information of Indian opinion to the effect that Opposition Members(i) were invited to attend the Conferenceon the understanding that, though theywould be free to engage in all discus-sions, and though their agreement wouldbe sought, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould not regard it as an essentialpre-condition for formulating theirlegislptive proposals&apos;,    that,  in fact,as Lo^d Irwin points out that Indiansanticipate, the agreement on ^.hichHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos; s proposals are to be formulated is agreementbetween Indian representatives andHis Majesty&apos;s Government with whomthe responsibility rests.(ii) were accepting the invitation on theun d er s t a nd i ng(a) that they would attend with a genuine purpose of co-operatingand. not, as some Indian leade-sare likely to apprehend, for
the purpose of wrecking theConference in advance.  (Obviouslythe fulfilment  of any such promisedepends very largely on thepersonality of the reprecenta-tives selected who would haveto be approved persons);(b) that they would support in Parlia-ment .any proposals to iiiiple-fl..entpoints on which their representa-tives at the Conference were inagreement with His Majesty&apos;sG-ov ernment&apos; s and the Indiandelegates .In addition,  it was suggested that in accepting the invitation the 6-pposition should give anundertaking that they accept the Viceroy&apos;sannounces ent  of November 1st- last, as- to dominion status being the natural issue of India&apos;constitutional progress,  or at lesast to avoid,and to secure the avoidance by their followers,of further attacks on that deolaration.The general view of the Cabinet was that theOpposition Parties would not be willing:to consent to participation in the Conference onthe above conditions as a whole.    For example,even though (as was generally agreed) some persons,such as the Chairman of the Indian statutory commission, might be unsuitable, owing to their previous association with India, to participate in the Conference, it world be inadvisable to insist on formal approval by the Government tothe representatives to be selected by theOpposition Parties.    It was felt, however, thatit might be possible to obtain by mutual arrange-ment the substance of what the Secretary of Statefor India proposed::   for example,  a clear under-standing that the Opposition representatives were on a different -footing from those of. the Govern-r..ent -    that their representatives should enter
the Conference in a spirit of good will and with a willingness to carry out the pledges given byprevious Governments:    together with a recognitionof the ^act that the responsibility for any proposals made as the result o&apos;F the Conferencerested with the Government alone.The Cabinet felt that some agreement on theabove lines was very desirable, as otherwise itmight be impossible to stave off a Debate duringthe forthcoming week, the repercussions of whichin India might be serious.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister and theSecretary o^ State for india should immediately place themselvesin touch with the Leaders of theOpposition Parties with a view toa further meeting, not the same day (since a Debate was to takeplace on a Vote of Censure) buton the following day:(b) That at this meeting the PrimeMinister and the Secretary ofState for India should be at liberty to show to the opposition leaders the telegrams attached to0.P.-242-A,  so as to make themacquainted with the viceroy&apos;view, and that agreement shouldbe sought on the lines suggestedab o v e:(c) That i^ agree: ent were reached, thePrime Minister should afterwardscommunicate with the Leaders ofthe Opposition setting forth hisunderstanding as to v.hat had beer,agreed:(d) That before any announcement vasmade, the concurrence of theViceroy should be obtained toth e a gr e ev, ent r ea ched .
THE GOAL 4. The President of the Board of TradeMINES BILL.reported that the House of Londs on the previousr/previous afternoon had resolved by 168 votes to 36 to -Reference:Cabinet 35 insist on its amendment substituting a permissive(39),  Con-conclusion 7.) spread-over of 90 working hours in a^ fortnightfor the Government&apos;s proposal  for a 7%-hours day.Setting aside the possibility of acceptance ofthis amendment, to which the miners&apos; representa-tives in Parliament and the Miners&apos;  Federationwere bitterly opposed, he said that there were two alternatives:-(i) To drop the Bill.This course, however, he explained, wouldinvolve a further deterioration of the industryand would confront the Government and the industry with a sudden drop of an hour a day in working hours next July without any intermediate stage.He characterised the loss of the Bill.as anunmitigated disaster.(11)  Further to amend the Houseof Lo^ds&apos;  amendment.The amendment already provided that the spread-over would, only come into *orce ifapproved by a majority of the owners and miners in a district.    The principle might, be extendedinto the national field by making the decisiono^ the district, subject to approval by theMining Association *nd the Miners&apos;  Federationof Great Britain respectively.    The President ofthe Poard o^ Trade thought, it possible that agreement to an amendment on these lines might bereached in the House of Commons,  and in that event it would be difficult for the House of Lords to reject it.
The President of the Board of Trade statedthat on the previous evening he had discussed the whole matter with the Miner Members ofParliament and with representatives of theExecutive of the Miners&apos;   Federation and had put to the:.;, these alternatives.    The Executive ofthe Miners&apos;  Federation were to meet the same afternoon at 2-30 p.u . to consider the whole position,  and it was not improbable that theywould summon a    ee*- ing of the Miners&apos;  Federation.They stated, however, that tnis meeting could not take place before the afternoon oF Monday next,July 21st .After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  (a) That the President of the Boardof Trade should, as soon aspossible, see representatives ofthe Executive of the Miners&apos;Federation and should ask themto consider carefully the wholecase, which he had presented tothem on the previous evening,including the proposal summarised above in the second alternativev:hich he had laid before theCabinet:(b) That the President of the Boardof Trade should not try to put pressure on the Executive of theMiners&apos;  Federation not to summon a meeting of the Federation, butthat he should inform them thatit was essential that the amend-ments of the House of Lords shouldbe considered in the House ofCommons on the evening of Monday next, July 21st.    He should, thereforeurge that, if they deemed a meetingof the Federation indispensable,they should arrange to summon itto meet not later than Saturdaynext, July 19th, so as to give time for any discussions with members of the fii-overnment thatmisht be necessary and for theGovernment to take its decision in the light of full knowledge ofthe Federation&apos;s views not later than Monday, July 21st:
I(c) That the President of the Boardof Trade should let the PrimeMinister know as soon as possiblewhat deeision was taken by theExecutive of the Miners&apos;  federation in regard to the oonferenee.

EGYPT. 9.      The Prime Minister read to the Cabinettwo telegrams from the High Commissioner in(Previous Egypt, Nos. 325 of July 15*11, and 326 of July 16th,Reference:Cabinet 38 in regard to recent disturbances at Alexandria.. .(50),  Con-clusion 5). In the latter telegram it was urged&apos;that two ships of war should be ordered immediately to alexandria, in order to show that our determination to discharge the obligations whichwe assumed internationally in 192^ was unchanged.The High Commissioner did not anticipate anynecessity for landing men, nor for a prolongedstay, but wished to forestall the possibledespatch of an Italian man-of-war to Alexandria,(one Italian subject having been killed by themob).      He suggested that the Officer Commandingshould be instructed not to enter Egyptianterritorial waters until he had obtained theHigh Commissioner&apos;s intimation that thepresence of ships in Alexandria harbour was still desirable.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the Cabinet that the Commander in Chief ofthe Mediterranean Fleet, on Board H.M.S. queen elizabeth, had already sailed,  in company with .M.S. RamillLes, from the island of Skiathosto Alexandria, where he was due on Fridaymorning.      There would be no difficulty incarrying out the instructions &quot;desired by theHigh Commissioner.The Cabinet were also informed thatBritish troops had been ordered to stand by, but
had not been employed.The above information was communicatedat an early stage of the Cabinet, but discussion was adjourned until the arrival of the -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.After his arrival, the cabinet approved his proposals, to the followingeffecti-(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should informthe Prime Minister of Egyptthat his Majesty&apos;s government must hold him responsible forthe protection of foreign lives and property.    Both the king and the Prime Minister shouldbe informed that we will be no party to the alteration of the electoral law.Further, that the HighCommissioner should be instructedto see Nahas Pasha at once;    totell him we have evidence thatthe riot was carefully prepared;that Egyptian internaldifficulties must be solved without endangering foreign lives and interests, and that he will beheld responsible if foreign lives and interests are endangered.Sir Percy    Loraine shouldalso be asked to take any action he may deem possible at the earliestpossible moment to mediate betweenthe two parties, with a view toavridinj the recurrence of suchdisastrous incidents;(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should make astatement in the House of commons in which he should mention theinstructions sent to Sir x^ereyLorains,to the effect that wewould be no party to the alterationof the electoral law.      He shouldalso repeat that we have,  inaccordance with our intentiondeclared in 1922, maintained apolicy of neutrality and non-intervention in Egyptian internalaffal&apos;.-s, and shall continue to do
so, to the extent compatible withour international responsibilities.If the question should be put asto whether the draft Treaty isstill open,  the reply &quot;should bethat future negotiations will depend on future events;( c)  That the First Lord of the admiralty should arrange for instructionsto be sent to the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean thatthe two capital ships now en route to Alexandria should not enterEgyptian territorial waters until it is learnt from the HighCommissioner that the presence ofships in Alexandria is stilldesirable,  and that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should send a communication to the HighCommissioner to this effect.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.34    *..... i confidential. \ Copy No.CP. 243 (30).CABINET.M. Briand&apos;s Memorandum for a Federated Union of Europe.Draft Reply proposed by Committee on Proposed European Federal Union.1. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have examined withprofound interest the proposals for the organisation of a system of European FederalUnion made by the French Government in their memorandum of the 17th May. Theyare of opinion that proposals so important in their purpose and in their scope require careful and prolonged consideration. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom would furthermore feel it their duty to undertake that consideration inconsultation with all His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the British Commonwealth.2. They are nevertheless desired to comply with the request of the FrenchGovernment that they should send in their observations on the proposals put forward in the memorandum not later than the 15th July. They have accordingly decided to address this note to the French Government, but they wish it to be understood thatthe comments and suggestions which it contains are of a preliminary andtentative kind.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom understand from thememorandum that the fundamental purpose which the French Government have inview is to divert the attention of the peoples of Europe from the hostilities of thepast and from the conflicts of interest between them which are sometimes alleged to exist, and to fix their attention instead upon the more important common interests which to-day they share. The French Government hope that by their proposals theymay promote closer co-operation among the nations and Governments of Europe, andthus strengthen the safeguards against another European war.4. With this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom arein the fullest sympathy. It is an axiom of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy thatthe first of British interests is peace, and measures calculated to ensure peace wilttherefore secure their ready and warm support. They earnestly hope that theinitiative of the French Government may bring about a better understanding by theEuropean peoples of the common interests which they share, and may thus lead both to greater mutual confidence and trust among their Government, and to a diminution^of the obstacles to international trade and economic co-operation which now exist.  &quot;5. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are also in agreementwith the French Government in thinking that it is primarily in respect of economic relations that closer co-operation between the nations of Europe is urgently to be desired.   : &apos; &apos; &apos; -6. They further agree that, if effective economic co-operation and concerted action are to be secured, it is essential that economic questions should be considerednot one by one, nor in respect of isolated interests, but as a whole, and from the.widerpoint of view of the general interests involved. Progress on such questions depends,on the extent that Governments and public opinion in the various countries can be&apos;brought to realise the vital importance of their common interests and the advantageseach will derive from measures of greater international solidarity.!&apos; While, -as theFrench Government: recognise; the iildependence&apos;and^hationah;sovereigntyf.of each:countiy. have to. be respected,-ids well as-the special ti^faffebtiu:^ partieiilar groups of nations, much can be done by political authorities to promote ^ai widbrvotitlobk.&apos;Onreconomic questions, and, in so far as political action is directed to that object, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom agree to the proposal made in thememorandum for the association of economic and political authorities! M u^V-5454   [21300]......................____________________.......________
7. In respect, however, of the methods proposed by the French Governmentfor the realisation of their purpose, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom feel more difficulty. They are not confident that mature examination will show that the establishment of new and independent international institutions is either necessary or desirable.8. If they have rightly understood the proposals contained in the memorandum,the French Government suggest the creation of a new European Conference and executive Committee, and perhaps also of a new European secretariat. These bodieswould in no way derive their authority from the Covenant or from Part XIII ofthe Treaty of Versailles; they would in no way be controlled by the rules and safe-guards which those instruments provide; they would be in no way organicallyconnected with the League of Nations; they would only correlate their work withthat of the organs of the League in so far as they decided by specific and spontaneousdecisions to do so in any given case that might arise. Since the organs of the Leaguehave already begun work on virtually the whole of the programme of practical actionwhich the memorandum puts forward, it is difficult to see how these new Europeaninstitutions could operate without creating confusion, and perhaps alsp a rivalry,which, however little it might be intended or desired by the European Governments,could hardly fail to diminish both efficiency and the authority of the organs of theLeague.9. Apart from this very difficult problem of co-ordination. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom think it possible that an exclusive and indepen-dent European Union of the kind proposed might emphasise or create tendencies tointer-continental rivalries and hostilities which it is important in the general interestto diminish and avoid. It is in their view essential that the measures taken for closerEuropean co-operation should not cause anxiety or resentment in any other continent.Unless this object is kept continually in view, His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom are satisfied that even wider interests, both of Europe andthe world, may be seriously endangered. It will be plain to the French Governmentthat in this connexion there are special considerations of which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, as a member of the British Commonwealth ofNations, must take account.&apos;10. Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are inclined to believe that the purpose which the French Government have in view can be effectively secured by so adapting the proposals put forward in the memorandum asto bring them fully within the framework of the League of Nations. They areimpressed by the fact that the Warsaw Health Conference of 1922, and thereconstruction of Hungary and Austria to name only a few of many examples thatmight be taken were matters of European interest and concern, and yet wereeffectively dealt with by the existing machinery of the League. They aretherefore convinced that it would be possible, perhaps by establishing EuropeanCommittees of the Assembly, of the Council and of the Technical Organisations of theLeague, or perhaps in other ways, to create whatever machinery is required for pro-promoting closer European co-operation without incurring the risks and difficultieswhich a system of new and independent institutions might involve.11. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom believe, however, thatthese are questions which can only be adequately dealt with in open discussion amongthe Governments concerned, after each Government has had time to examine fully and in all their aspects the proposals which have been made. Since, for the reasonsabove suggested, these proposals affect intimately not only the Governments ofEurope, but the Governments of all the members of the League, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom hope that the French Government may think itdesirable that their memorandum should be placed upon the agenda of the nextAssembly.12. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom earnestly hope thatthese tentative comments and suggestions may meet with the approval of the FrenchGovernment, and that by some such procedure as that above suggested, practicalresults of real value may be secured.; Juiyw, 1930.- ; &apos;,&apos;&apos;..&apos;!: [
