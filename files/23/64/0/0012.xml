9s) e3.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Health (Paper C.P.-201 (30))on the subject of Birth Control, in which he stated that the question had again come before him in connection with the powers of Local Authori-ties to establish either (l) separate birthcontrol clinics, or (2) gynaecological clinicsat which advice and information as to contra-ceptive methods would be given to those whoattend.   The Minister of Health stated that hewas advised that there is probably a need incertain areas for the establishment of gynaecol-ogical clinics, and he did not consider., there-fore, that- he would be justified in withholdingany Departmental sanction that may be necessaryfor the provision of such clinics by LocalAuthorities.   But under the Public Health Actsthese clinics could be provided only for the reception of the sick, and he propose^, therefore,to Eake it a condition of his sanction -(i) that the clinics would be availableonly for women who are in need of medical advice and treatment forgynaecological conditions;    and(ii) that advice on contraceptive methodswould be given only to married women who attend the clinics for medical advice or treatment and in whosecases pregnancy would be detrimenta 1to health.As regards the case of the birthcontrol clinic for expectant mothersand nursing mothers   he proposed torefuse to sanction loans except on condition that contraceptive advicewould be given only in cases wherefurther pregnancies would be detrl-mental to health.
The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Health, and agreed with him that it is desir-able to maintain the position that without express directionsfrom Parliament the Governmentwill&apos; not sanction the expendi-ture of public money for theprovision of facilities forgiving birth control advicepromiscuously to any woman who may ask for it.
4.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-219 (30))on the subject of Unemployment Finance.

This is doneby Section 1.    In addition, Section 2 of theBill repeals Section 4 of the Treaties of&quot;Washington Act,  1922, in which power was takento implement the Washington (Root) Treaty toprotect neutrals and non-combatants at sea intime of war, insofar as power was then taken to try and punish as if for an act of piracy anyperson in the service   of any Power who violatedthe rules that were set out in Article 1 of the root Treaty.The Cabinet approved in principle the London Naval Treaty Bill and invited the First Lord of theAdmiralty to consult his legal advisers once more as to whetherit was really essential to passthis Bill before the ratification of the London Naval Treaty.The date of introduction of theBill, in the light of these enquiries, was left for arrangement between the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Prime Minister,&apos;
