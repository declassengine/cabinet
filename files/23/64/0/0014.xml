INDIA. 1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat at a meeting held on the previous evening(previous reference: between himself, the Secretary of State for India,Cabinet 36 ..(30), Con- Mr Baldwin, Sir Austen Chamberlain, Mr Lloyd Georgeelusion 2.)and Lord Reading, the Opposition leaders had urged that, since the Indian Statutory commission had been set up under the provisions of an Actand was composed entirely of Members ofParliament,of Parliament^and the House of Commons was veryparticularly concerned in the Report, Parliamentought to express its thanks to the Commission.The Parnell Commission of March 11, 1890, hadbeen cited as a precedent for the procedure proposed.   The Opposition Leaders had then handed to him for consideration the following resolution:-&quot;That this House records its thanks to the Indian Statutory commission for the masterly survey of Indianconditions and government containedin their Report,   whilst desiringthat the Conference should be free to discuss any proposals which may-be put before it, and whilstreserving its final opinion untilthe results of the discussion are known, this House places on recordits sense of the high authority and intrinsic value of the construc-tive contribution to the solutionof the problems of Indian Govern-ment made by the Commission&apos;sunanimous Report&quot;.The Prime Minister had intimated at once thatcertain words were unacceptable and that he musthave time to consider the whole matter, which had at once been agreed to.The discussion on this proposal revealedagreement on the following points:-1.   It was essential that the initiationin any resolution of thanks to theStatutory Commission should remain with the Government.2.   In view of the Viceroy&apos;s reports as to the attitude of indian opinion towards the Report ofthe Commission and of the oritioal
situation in India, and havingregard to the importance of theGovernment entering the Gon-ference entirely unfettered, itwould be desirable, if possible,to avoid a Parliamentary Debate.3.    Prom this point of view it wouldbe preferable, if practicable, toavoid passing a formal resolution^which would - involve debate and- the likelihood of embarrassing amend-,ments being moved,&quot;the mere dis-cussion of which might exercise an adverse effect on Indian opinion,and to confine the expression of thanks to an answer to a questionput to the Prime Minister withwhich the Leaders of the opposition parties could associate themselves and even perhaps move that it be entered on the Journal of theHouse..if.    That y if this course should not prove acceptable to the opposition parties, it would be necessary tore-draft the resolution in a form which should be as innocuous aspossible.5^   That it was essential that any resolution moved in parliament should have the assent of theViceroy.      Consequently theSecretary of State for India should ascertain the views of the Viceroyon the form of a resolution if itwere found necessary to move it,and in doihfe&quot; so he should transmitfor his information the text ofthe resolution suggested by theOpposition Leaders.6.    That the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for India should consult further on the subject with the Opposition Leadersi
SAFEGUARD INGOF INDUSTRIESf (previous reference;Cabinet 26(29), Con-elusion 2 .)parliamentary business .(previous reference erence:Cabinet 34(30), Con-clusion 1.)2. The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion on the subject of the following resolution tabled by Mr Baldwin and Mr Neville chamberlain:-&quot;That this House, believing that a return to prosperity can best be promoted by safeguarding the home market against unfair foreign corn-petition, and by expanding theexport market by reciprocal trade agreements with the Empire overseas,regret that the Government hasreversed the policy of safeguardinginstead of extending it, and hasarbitrarily excluded from consider-ation the imposition of duties uponforeign foodstuffs devised to obtainequivalent advantages for Britishmanufactures and agriculture inEmpire markets and elsewhere.&quot;The Prime Minister stated that, in order toprovide time for a Debate on this resolution and perhaps on India without upsetting the parliamentary time-table,  it had been arranged that one day should be taken off the discussion of the housing bill (which was passed by the House of commons the same evening), and one day off the ScottishHousing Bill.The arrangements for Parliamentary business in order to provide time for the Debate on theresolution were discussed with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury.    A suggestion was made that a Supply Vote should be taken on Thursday,July 10th, instead of the London Traffic Bill, as arranged, and that opportunity should be given fora Debate on Palestine, if desired by the Opposition.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury,however, gave reasons in favour of making progress with theuLondon Traffic Bill in order to pass it onto the Rouse of Lords as soon as possible.The general lines on which the Safeguardingresolution should be met were discussed.
(a) That the President of the Boardof Trade should be responsiblefor drafting an amendment to be moved to the&quot;above resolutionfor consideration byv the Cabinet,if possible before the conclusionof the. Meeting fixed for^thefoil owing n. or ning :(b) That the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Treasury should endeavourto arrange for the Debate on the safeguarding resolution to be taken on Thursday,  July 17th, but, ifpressed, should have authority toagree to Tuesday, July 15th, as already arranged.
