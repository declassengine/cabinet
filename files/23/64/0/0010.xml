On the authority of theCommittee a reply had been sent to the effect:-(i) That His Majesty&apos;s Government see no objection to the communication which the Iraq Government now propose to address to the iraq petroleum Company definitelyannouncing that unless the Haifaline is decided upon they willnot proceed with negotiations,but(ii) that they would prefer not totake the initiative in bringing the Iraq Governments views tothe notice o-&quot; the French Govern-ment, as officially desired bythe Iraq Gov eminent.It was stated in the Inter in) Report that theCommittee did not propose to take any further action until it was seen how the situationdeveloped as the result of the Iraq Governmentscommunication to the Iraq Petroleum Company.Important developments, however, -would at Wee.be considered by the Commit,tee and a further^Report would then, if necessary, be submitteX tothe Cabinet .The Cabinet approved the InterimReport of the Iraq Oil Committee.
THE COAL 10. TEe President of the Board of TradeMINES BILL.informed the Cabinet that he had received a(Previous visit from the Leader of the Opposition in the reference:Cabinet 28 House of Lords, who had made it clear that in all(30),  Con-clusion 2.) probability a majority in the House of lords would reaffirm the amendments to the Coal mines bill which had been rejected by the House ofCommons.   He wished to warn his colleagues thatin that event a serious situation would arise and. it would probably be necessary for him toask for an immediate Meeting of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said he would a*uppan. aMeeting of the Cabinet if an emergency arose.-11-
11.   The President of the Board of Trade stated :that an International Conference,  attended by representatives of 34 nations, had been sittingsome weeks to consider the Plimsoll load-line for ships, and a deadlock had been reached.   the subjects at issue divided themselves into three categories, namely, the Plimsoll line for (l) ships carrying general cargo, which mainly affectedBritish interests; (2) tankers, which mainlyaffected American interests; (3) timber ships,on which latter accommodation could be reached..In regard to ships carrying general cargothere was a prospect of an improvement in regardto the Plimsoll line, which would be of decidedadvantage from the British point of view.    Sofar as tankers were concerned, however, the americans, who were mainly concerned, demanded a concession and threatened to break up the wholeConference if their demands were not met.   two british master-mariners, who were members of theConference, were opposing this concession on theground of safety, but the representative of theBritish Trades Unions concerned was willing toagree to it.   Technically, oil tankers were safer,ships than ordinary cargo.vessels,.for various reasons, including the fact that their cargo couldbe pumped out without-&apos; removing hatches.     Theposition was that at present there was a dangerof losing the considerable advantages to beobtained from the alteration of the Plimsoll line in regard to general cargo vessels (affecting from83 to 85 pe- cent, of British shipping) unless a concession was made to the American point of view
in regard to tanker vessels (in which. british shipping was only concerned to a relatively smallextent) .The Cabinet agreed  That the President of the Boardof Trade should have authorityto agree to a concession to theAmerican point of.view in regardto tanker vessels if, without this, he could not obtain theagreement he desired in regardto general cargo vessels.
TBUCF. ^by the President of the Board of Trade (PaperRatification0f. CP.-203 (30)) asking Cabinet authority to ratification of the Tariff Truce.    In this(previous reference: connection attention was drawn in the MemorandumCabinet 24(30), Con- to the following two matters:-elusion 8.)(i) A statement made by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, speaking for thePrime Minister, on February 18thlast, when he said &quot;Papers willbe laid in both Houses, but theGovernment will be guided by theopinion of the House of Commons*.In view of the fact that general debate of the question had takenplace on two occasions, onceduring the progress of the confer-ence and the second time on theBoard of Trade Vote on May 14th,it was suggested that ratificationmight properly be effected withoutfurther discussion, notwithstandingSi&quot;- Aus t en Chamberlain er la in&apos; s s ta t ementin Parliament on April 1st that theOpposition would ask for an occasion to discuss the matter on its merits,&quot;when we can move a Motion in regardto it&quot;.(ii) The Commercial Convention preventsus from imposing new protective duties or increasing the protectionof existing duties until April 1,1931, and in fact thereafter unless we first denounced the Convention.At the time of the negotiations ithad been assumed that this was inaccordance with the settled policyof the present Administration.   Itwas pointed out, however, that since then on more than one occasionproposals in direct conflict withthis undertaking had been suggested.    \The Cabinet agreed  That the ratification of the TariffTruce should be delayed for the present es ent.

In this Memorandum it was stated thatthe Joint Committee of the Cotton Trade Organisa-tions had conferred with the Home Secretary andthat they concurred in the publication of theReport provided that arrangements were made forthe Report to be communicated to the trade just before publication.    They had suggested that this might be done at a specially convened meeting ofthe Joint Committee, at which a member of theCabinet should be present to state the views ofthe Government.    They further suggested that,  inorder to meet the susceptibilities of some of.their constituent organisations, it would bedesirable that communications should be addressedon behalf of the Government to each of thosebodies,  explaining the action proposed to be taken and expressing the Government&apos;s hope that theirrepresentatives would be able to be present atthe proposed meeting.   This course of action wasdeemed reasonable by the Home Secretary, whorecommended it for the approval of the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of the HomeSecretary, as set forth above:(b) That the Liverpool Cotton Associa-tion and the Manchester CottonAssociat.ion,. who are not at pres entmembers of the Joint Committee, aswell as the organisations which are-members of that&apos;Committee, should beinvited to send representatives tothe meeting to be attended by amember of the Cabinet:(c) That the Home Secretary should bethe member of the Cabinet to attend the meeting on behalf of the Governments
O A 9 -u oThe Cabinet had before them a copy of aletter from the Secretary of State for scotland to the Prime Minister (Paper CP.-200 (50))enclosing a note of the proceedings at a Deputa-tion he had received from the Church of Scotlandand the Free Church of Scotland on the subject of irish Irmnigration into Scotland.   The Deputationasked the Government to take steps (l) to provideeffective measures to regulate emigration from ireland: (2) to secure that immigrants from theFree State who become a public charge in scotland should be repatriated: and (3) to fix a minimum period before ah immigrant be allowed to exercise the franchise..   The suggestion was also made thata column should be added to the next CensusReturn to show the religion of the person oon-cerned.   The Secretary of State had promised theDeputation that he would report the matter tohis colleagues in the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed -(a,.  That the minister of labour should furnish a supplementary report on the subject;(b) That the subject should befurther considered at an early meeting of the Cabinet, whenit should be placed early onthe Agenda Paper.
BIRTH CONTROL. 15. In the absence of the Minister of Health,his Memorandum (CP.-201 (30)), on the Subject(previous reference: of Birth Control, was postponed until a&apos;laterCabinet 38(29), Con- Meeting of the Cabinet,elusion 5.)-17-
agriculturalRESEARCHORGANISATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(50), Con-clusion 11.)1C   The Cabinet bad before them the following documents relating to Agricultural research organisation:-The Report of the agricultural research Organisation Committeeof the Fconomic Advisory Council(Paper C.P.-154 (30)):A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries  (paper cp.-168 (30)):A Note by the Lord President ofthe Council covering the Conclu-sions of a Conference of Ministers(Paper G.P.-194 (30)) recommending the following amendments to theReport of the Committee on Agri-cultural Research Organisation:-(a) para. 23 (d)  (iv), page 7,omit everything after&quot;requirements&quot;:    para.23 ( d)(vi), page 7, insert after&quot;State&quot; the words &quot;the empire marketing Board and the AdvisoryCommittee of the Colonial Develop-roent Fund&quot;;(b) that the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the colonies should not be a member of theCommittee of the Privy Councilreferred to in para.23 (b) onpage 6 of the Report.A Note by the Lord President ofthe Council (Paper CP.-211 (30))supplementing Paper CP.-194 (30) and stating that the present Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries, ontaking office, had approached theLord President of the Council and asked for a further discussion onthis Memorandum, as the result ofwhich the following agreement hadbeen reached:-&quot;The Council will act in eonsult-ation with the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries andthe Secretary of State forScotland, and the departments will provide the Council withall information at their dis-posal as to their researchgrants &quot; .The Lord President therefore asked the Cabinet to accept his MemorandumS.P.-194 (30)  ,  in which the abovenote of agreement would now be incorporated.-1r-
The Cabinet approved theagreement negotiated.by the&quot;Lord President of the Council,as set forth above.The Lord President of the Council,  theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries have set out in thefollowing note what appears would ultimately be theworking relation of the Departments and theAgricultural Research Council:-&quot;(1) That the existing relationship ofthe Departments of Agriculture withthe Agricultural Research Institutes,University Departments of Agriculture,and Agricultural Colleges, will notbe affected by the creation of theCouncil and that grants will be madeby the Departments to these institu-tions as heretofore, but that inrespect of Research Grants the Depart-ments will provide the council withall information at their disposal and receive its criticism or advice.(2)  That the Council will consult theMinister of Agriculture and Secretaryof State for Scotland with regard to proposals affecting the Institutionsfor which their Departments areresponsible.(3)    That expenditure for Researchservices hitherto administered by
the Departments of Agriculture andborne on their votes shall so remain,together with any expenditure here-after authorised for the expansionof those services;  but that the sums sanctioned by the Treasury forthe purpose of the research council shall be borne on the vote of the privy Council.&quot;
INDIA.CongressCampaign andthe Conference.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(30), Con-clusion 7 .)17.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (Paper CP.-214(30)) on the Congress Campaign and the forthcoming conference.   This Memorandum traced the growth of civil disobedience up to the present time, and pointed out that among all classes of Indiansthere is a great and growing sense of national andracial consciousness which finds expression in opposition to foreign rule; that the Party whichhas shown itself willing to take an active leadershipnamely, the Congress, is securing an acknowledgmentof its right to that position from other andconflicting Parties:    and, further, that thoughthe movement is in the main unarmed, the number of active participants, as in the demonstrations in bombay, is presenting great practical difficulties.The overt movement has developed at a speed andwith a momentum which has taken by surprise themost qualified observers, and this development has occurred since the Statutory Commission com-pleted its labours in India, so that the situationis not generally appreciated in this country.Attached to the Memorandum was a draft of a proposed statement to be made by the Prime minister or Secretary of State for India in regard to thescope of the Conference.;     In view of the importance of thisquestion,  the Cabinet agreed -To meet on the following morning, at 9.3O a.m.,  toconsider the question, after which,  if time permit, anyother outstanding businessmight bo taken.,?hitehall Gardens, S.W.1.24th June,  1930.
BDIAIE.Your telegrams Nos. 280 and 282, (June 20th:  inter-views with Sidky and Nahas respectively).I warmly approve of your action in sending for Nahasand of the language which you held to him.I am relieved to learn that technical violation of constitution has so far been avoided and I an most anxious that before one takes place a way out of the presentsituation should have been discovered.In the fourth paragraph of my telegram No. 270 ofSeptember 11th last I gave the reasons which made itimpossible for us to carry on with the Mahmoudf Government.The same reasons appear to me to apply with equal forcein the case of the Government of Sidky Pasha.    It may be argued that it is not a question of supporting Sidky but of maintaining the attitude of neutrality in accordancewith the instructions already sent to yout    in practice as mr. Hoare showed in a recent despatch the presence ofBritish troops in Cairo makes it impossible for us toremain really neutral and aloof indefinitely,We have got to make up our minds that in the end itis with a government representative of an overwhelmingparliamentary majority that we shall have to deal for itis only such a government that can deliver the goods sofar as a settlement is concerned.     This being the caseour/1989/4/16).To    EGYPT.Cypher telegram to Sir P. Loraine (Cairo),Foreign Office, 24th June, 1930.      2.00 p.m.No.  211.
our strategic objective must be to get the late governmentback into office in a sober and chastened temper,, and theSidky Government out without penalty or subsequentpersecution,,      The King&apos;s face must be saved but he no lessthan the Wafd must learn his lesson.       A leading article intoday&apos;s &quot;Times&quot; without any prompting from here advocatesa solution on these lines.       I mention this as indicating the trend of sane conservative opinion in this country.Prom your telegrams I have derived the impression that King Fuad may be under a misapprehension as regardsthe attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards parliamentaryregime in Egypt and that he has interpreted our reply tohis soundings to mean that he can henceforth rely on our support to suppress parliamentary government which is theobject of his particular dislike.     If that is indeed HisMajesty&apos;s conclusion you should take immediate steps to dispelillusion under which he appears to be labouring.The experience of the last ten years has shownconclusively that the King* s intervention to suppressparliamentary government in Egypt has on no single occasionserved the interests of Anglo-Egyptian readerstanding. Onthe contrary it has nearly always resulted in confusingthe issue, led to disturbances and involved His Majesty&apos;sGovernment against their will in forcible interventions.That the Wafd are more than a little scared is indicated by communication which has reached me throughDoctor Mahmoud.     This almost amounted to an offer to putthrough the treaty in return for our support.     Such an offer even if its fulfilment could be relied upon I would notdream of accepting.       On the other hand if we are to depart from our attitude of declared neutrality to theext ent/1
extent which may be necessary to urge a solution on theKing and Sidky, we must have reasonable ground forassurance that Wafd will not plunge us into fresh Crisisby introduction of what I can only describe as provocativelegislation, *a.g. Assemblies or Arms Bills.So far as present crisis is concerned it seems to mothat bill for protection of  the constitution might beallowed to pass if the penalties were made less severe.The situation is developing so rapidly that I cannot do more than indicate to you the lines on which I should like to see a solution achieved.      In any event it appearsto me essential that you should make it abundantly clear to King fuad (and you need not mince your language) thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government do not intend to be used as hisinstrument for an attack on the constitution. -   Over theKing and Sidky, dependent as they are on our benevolentneutrality, we have considerable control;    the Wafd areout of office and passionately anxious to get back.There are here, it seems to me, the elements necessaryto make a compromise possible and in this telegram I have indicated the lines on which I  should like you to seek it.
APPEND IX.  II.CONCLUSIONS OP THE CHIEF QP THEIMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.   IN    PAPERQ.P..- 02 (SOT.(i) There is every probability that the presentdisturbed condition of China will continue for many years,during which time^-will be necessary for us to continueto be in a position to afford protection to british nationals in that country.(ii) Protection should be afforded to Britishcommunities situated at places in the following order of priority:-Shanghai, Tientsin and Peking, Canton (Shameen), Hankow.Of the above, the occupation of Shanghai should betemporary and should, cease whenever political conditions have improved sufficiently to warrant the withdrawal ofour troops to Hong-Kong.   The protection afforded atCanton and Hankow should be by means of naval forces, inorder to obviate fresh military commitments which would inevitably become unlimited and necessitate an increased.&apos;garrison in China.(iii) The post-war garrison of-Tientsin and Hong Kong,a total of S battalions, was shown by the events- of 1927to be clearly inadequate for any purpose other than thesecurity o^ those places under normal conditions.   Toenable incipient trouble to be nipped in the bud at shangai or in Tientsin, and to obviate the necessityfor again -sending considerable forces to the Far East at short notice, a minimum garrison of 6 battalions isnecessary in China.    This would make available a mobile -force of 4 battalions  &quot;or despatch to Shanghai or to.NorthChina for the protection or our nationals in any futureemergency, and at the same time would leave minimumobligator;; garrisons in Kong Kong and Tientsin.(iv) In the Peking-Tientsin area,  it is reasonable to rely upon Japanese assistance to foreign nationals, and aminimum British garrison o^ 1 battalion should, therefore,be-permanently maintained in that area.    This is a commit-ment under the Protocol of 1901.(v) For the defence op Hong. Kong and for the provisionof a reserve for use elsewhere in China, the existing -garrison is totally inadequate.    As soon as Shanghai.isevacuated, the permanent infantry garrison should be,atleast 5 battalions, of which.1 may be Indian.(vi) The distribution of the infantry units in China&apos;after the evacuation, of Shanghai should be:-Hong Kong    ... ... 5 battalions.Peking-Tientsin       ... 1 battalion.(vii) In making these definite recommendations&apos;,  I desire to emphasise that this estimate of our futvreina/ garrison^is based upon the following content ion:-
The smallest detached unit which can usefully and safely be employed on pro-tective duties is one company, and our experience of the Nanking detachment,v/hich, after continual representations by the General Staff, ,%a&apos;s not withdrawnuntil after a period of 10 months, showsthat,  onoe a small military force isinstalled as a protective measure,  every possible political argument will be usedto prevent its withdrawal.    Should we accept the policy of providing protectionat even a limited number of smaller ports,we should be faced with a series of similarprotracted occupations, which will involvethe retention in China of a larger numberof troops than I have, up to date,  consid-ered to be necessary.
