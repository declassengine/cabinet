Further Clause in Note to read -&quot;It has further been agreed that,if the treatj- is worked in thesame -friendly spirit in which ithas been negotiated, His Majesty^Government in.the United kingdom will be prepared to examinesympathetically a proposal forthe return to the Sudan of an egyptian battalion simultaneously with the withdrawal of the british forces from Cairo&quot; .
The Cabinet further authorisedits representatives to continuethe negotiations for the comple-tion of the Treaty and the note on condition that the egyptian delegation accept the above-mentioned proposals.
UHEMPL CYMENT 2. The Cabinet had before them the Report ofPOLICY.the Unemployment Policy (1930) Committee (Paper(Previous C.Ptf-134 (30)) which had been appointed on reference:Cabinet 24 February 3, 1950, to consider the Unemployment(30),  Con-clusion 7.) situation in the light of the latest figures and in this connection to have regard to aMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster (Paper CP.-31 (30)).   The Conclusionsof the Cabinet Committee are summed up at the endo&quot;&quot; the Report as follows:-(i) The Economic Advisory Councilrecently set up was carefullydevised in order to co-coordinate the policy of the Government oneconomic matters, includingunemployment., without overlap-ping with the responsibilities of the Ministers and departments directly concerned,  and, whileits constitution must necessarily be tested by experience, it wouldappear to be the most appropriateorganisation for this purpose.(ii) However much we may be criticised,we must not be rushed into shovel-ling out public money merely forthe purpose of taking what must inevitably be a comparatively small number of people off theunemployed register to do Yorkwhich is no more remunerative and much more expensive even thanunemployment.(iii) The Government must be preparedto direct itself to the applica-tion of schemes which will notonly fulfil the condition thatthey provide immediate employment,but which also stand the test of reducing the. cost of productionand adding to the economic powerof the country,(iv) Despite the temporary unfortunate results of intensive rationalisation-tion, we must not be afraid to facethese temporary consequences.   TheGovernment has never admitted thatits policy must be tested byimmediate results.   We have alwayssaid that we have a well-thought-outpolicy which must take time todevelop.(v) Both for political and. financial-reasons, we must d.o all we can
to combat the present feeling ofinsecurity in our financial prospects, and we must, therefore,avoid, all schemes involving heavyadditions to Budget charges orgrandiose loan expenditure.The Cabinet also had before them a Memorandumby the First Commissioner of Works (Paper C.P0-I45(30)) putting on record his reasons for dissentingfrom some of the conclusions arrived at by hiscolleagues on the Cabinet Committee.The Cabinet agreed  That the Report of the CabinetCommittee and the Memorandum bythe First Commissioner of works should be referred for examination by a Committee of the Ministersassociated with the Lord privy seal on Unemployment,( First Commissioner of Works,Chancellor of the E&amp;uchy of lancaster and the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State,  Scottish Office), over which the Prime Minister wouldpreside for purposes of this inquiry.   The suggestion wasmade that the Committee should pay special attention to theimportance of pushing on rapidlywith schemes already approved for relief of unemployment.
agricultural policy.StatutoryQuota ofBritish wheat in Flour .(previous reference:Cabinet 17(30)    Con-clusion 4(c) .)3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the proposed Statutoryquota of British wheat  in flour:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (paper c.P.-135 (30)) setting forth thefacts in regard to the existingsevere depression in Agriculture,and covering an Annex containingalternative methods for applyinga Statutory quota of british wheat in flour.A Memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (Paper CP,-.139 (30)) in which the proposals were examined and the conclusion was reached that the proposedwheat quota has little to commendit,  that it would comm.it us to a false principle which might provemost embarrassing,  and that weshould be wise to have nothing to do with it:A further Memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries (paper c.P .-142 (30)), and a Not e by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheriescovering a Memorandum by the Parlia-mentary Secretary to the Ministry(Paper C.P.-143 (30)),  criticisingthe Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper CP.-139 (30))and seeking to remove certainmisapprehensions on which,  intheir opinion,, the Memorandum was based.The Agricultural The Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum.Marketing Bill.by the Secretary of State for Scotland (Paper(previous reference: C .P .-144 (30)) on the subject of the MarketingCabinet 21(30), Con- Bill, stating his reasons for strongly supportingelusion 12.)the proposal to give encouragement to organisedmarketing in the suggested &quot;hite Paper on Agri-cultural Policy, and urging that an announcement should be made by the Government in regard to thisBiatter at the earliest possible moment.After a long discussion in regard to agricultural Policy as a whole, including other aspects as well as those mentioned in the Papers
circulated, the Cabinet agreed -To continue the discussion attheir next weekly Meeting, onthe understanding that thesubject should appear on theAgenda Paper immediately afterany urgent business requiringdecision.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,May 8, 19 30,
APPENDIX.Copy&apos;of Telegram from the Governor-General, Khartoum, tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.D. 11.5 p.m.   May 7th, 19j$0.E. 1.15 a.m.   May 3th, 1930.No. 1.immediate.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 1 May 7th.Repeated to Cairo No. 83.Your telegram No. 1.While anxious, if it were possible, to Introduce asolution of most difficult position that has arisen we forour part feel it is our duty in the permanent interests ofthis country to maintain the position stated in our secondtelegram unnumbered of May Jth. and restated with suc-cinctness and force by Mr. Hoare in his telegram No. 217.The conclusion of a Treaty leaving open to immediatediscussion the -participation of Egypt in the administra-tion of the Sudan would immediately give rise to grave un^settlement and ultimately undermine the fabric.     Now thatthe object of Egypt in respect of the Sudan has been soclearly disclosed, viz. a share In the administration, wewould earnestly ask His Majesty5s Government to considerwhether the course now proposed is not a historical and moral &quot;non sequitur&quot; which caanot be reconciled with theultimate interests of this country and the definite trend of His Majesty*s Government&apos;s policy in the past.Since writing the above W3   have received and notedyour telegram No. 2.      It does not modify our opinionexpressed above.
