2r*0EGYPT .The Anglo-egyptian treaty.(previous reference:Cabinet 24(30), Con-elusion 1.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Conference on the Egyptian negotia-tions had been in session since 8 a,m. the same morning .   He then read a series of telegrams whichhad been exchanged withinuthe previous 24 hourswith the Governor-General of the Sudan (Appendix) ..The Cabinet were informed that a difficult position had arisen owing to the objection madeby the Governor-General       the Sudan to theproposal to enter into friendly discussions withthe Egyptian Government within twelve months fromthe coming into ^oroe of the present Treaty withregard to the application of the Conventions of1899.,    This proposal had been made to the egyptian delegation, subject to the approval of the Cabinet,and the Egyptian Delegation had accepted it.    TheGovernor-General&apos;s objection was that the promiseimplied an intention to agree to some modificationof the present position and to stigmatise that position as being merely a temporary arrangement.The Governor-General further proposed that noclause in the Treaty with Egypt should be signeduntil the discussions regarding the Sudan were finally completed..   The Secretary of State alsoread a telegram (included in the Appendix)  fromthe Figh ^Commissioner at Cairo supporting the viewsof the .-ff^g^-&amp;Q^s4i3sioner-of the Sudan.The Cabinet were informed that the British Dele-gation had secured important concessions from theEgyptian Delegation. The latter had agreed to acknow--ledge the Conventions of 1899, which hitherto
they had refused to recognise.      They had also r-ecognisedthat the Governor-General had power to act under thoseConventions, which conferred on him very autocraticpowers,.      The undertaking given in return was that if either party should so request,  there should be friendlydiscussions within twelve months from the coming into forceof the present Treaty with regard to the application of thesaid convention.      Those discussions would probably haveto take place in any event, as otherwise the egyptian government could raise the question under Article 4jb of theTreaty.      There was no doubt, however, as to the aim ofthe Egyptian Delegation, which was to claim Egyptiansovereignty in the Sudan.The issue before the Cabinet was summed up asfollows:-     Is it advisable to make a Treaty In regardto Egypt, postponing a settlement of the Sudan,  or arethe circumstances such that it is inadvisable to makea Treaty at all that is not comprehensive?The Cabinet agreed -(a) To hold a further Meeting the same eveningat 3 p.m. in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room atthe House of Commons:,(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign4ffairs should at piice send a furtherelegram to the jfagfrvCommisQ practitioner of theudan pointing out the concessions which&amp;. $WflfiJV^^     M      had already been obtained from the Egyptian0 Delegation, reminding him of what he hadalready agreed to in 1929* and asking fora further expression of his views:(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, in the meanwhile, continue his negotiations with the Egyptian Delega-tion, pointing out to them that objectionshad been raised against the proposed conversations within twelve months, andsounding them as to whether they would agree on the proposal cf 1929.
MALTA.The Situationin.Attitudethe &quot;Vatican.(previous reference:Cabinet 3^ IX(29), Con-clusion 4&apos;.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised,  as a matter of urgency,  the difficultieswhich had arisen with the Vatican in regard toaffairs in Malta, where,  owing to the action ofthe Archbishop o^ Malta and the Bishop of Gozoin instructing the clergy to refuse to administer the Sacrament to those who voted for the Sovem-use nt now in power, the Governor had found itnecessary to postpone the Elections on grounds  ofnational safety.In the course of a short discussion it wassuggested that while there were objections to thepermanent withdrawal of the British Minister tothe Vatican, it might be desirable, on the vacation&quot;by  the present occupant of the post, not toreplace him and to leave the legation in changeo &apos;p a Charg e* d&apos; Affair es .The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority -(a) in consultation with theSecretary of State for theColonies, to publish papers on this subject:(b) to inform the Vatican ofthis int ent ion:(c) to authorise the british representative at the vatican to make a finalprotest .
BAGHDAB-haifa railway and pipeline.IRAQ,-MED IT ER-RANFAN PIPE-LINE and railway .(previous reference:Cabinet 17(30), Con-clusion 3.)4.The Cabinet had before then:, the Reportof the Cabinet Committee on the Baghdad-haifa railway and Pipeline (Paper C.P.-I36 (30)).Appended to the Report were a Letter and Memo-randum from Sir John Caiman, the Chairaan of theTurkish Petroleum Company, dated March 20, 1930,and a Note by the First Lord o* the Admiraltycovering a Memorandum by the Chief of the naval staff urging the importance, from a Naval pointof view, of bringing the pipeline terminus toHaifa instead of to a Syrian port.    The recom-mendations in the Report of the Cabinet Committeewere as follows :-(i) A Syrian terminal to the Iraq-Mediterranean pipeline and railway be accepted.(ii) Negotiations should be openedwith the French Government as early as possible with theobject of obtaining therequirements desired by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of Iraq should thet erminal to the pipeline and railway be on the Syrian coast.(iii) The Iraq Government should beacquainted of the negotiationswith the French Government atan opportune moment.The Cabinet also had before them a Note bythe Secretary to the Cabinet (Paper C.P.-141 (30))covering the Report of an Inter-DepartmentalSub-Committee of the Cabinet Committee on the bagadad-Haifa Railway and Pipeline,  circulatedby direction of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.    On the instructions of theCabinet Committee the Sub-Committee had considex--ed what action should be taken in view of therecommendations contained, in the Report of theCabinet Committee (Paper C.P.-136 (30)), to
ensure that the needs of&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Iraq Government are met in the event of aBaghdad-Mediterranean Railway and Pipeline with aSyrian terminal being constructed.    In theirReport (which had not yet been considered by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs or themembers of the Cabinet Committee on the Haifa-Baghdad Railway and Pipeline) the Sub-committee recommended that in the negotiations with theFrench Government  every effort should be.made tosecure that the requirements of the BritishGovernment were satisfied in regard to the follow-ing specific points:-(l) An assurance from France should beobtained that in time of peace, orwhen France is a neutral,  or an ally,the French Authorities will place no restriction on the export of oil toBritish ports,  including Malta. Theycould be informed, of course, thatwe would do nothing that involvesmaking Tripoli a base of supply with.M,Ships or the Fleet direct.(2) The Iraq-Mediterranean railway, whenconstructed, will open up a route whichwill facilitate the rapid transport oftroops,  aircraft, supplies and munitions to Iraq and India,  and will thus becomeof great strategical importance.    Itis  essential that agreement to the trans-Syrian route should be condi-tional on the grant o^ facilitiesfor the transport of troops, aircraftsupplies and munitions (a)  in peace and (b) - in so far as may be compat-ible with the principles of Inter-national Law and with the obligations- of the parties concerned towards theLeague of Nations - in the event ofa war affecting the security of Iraior British interests in the East..The conditions governing the transportof troops over the Oilician railway,in so far as these conditions would apparently not be operative in theevent .of one or other of the con-tract ing parties being neutral in a conflict in which the other party   -was engaged, are not a completelysuitable precedent.(3) An attempt should be made to securethe placing in Great Britain of a
fixed proportion of orders for railway and pipeline material.(4) So far as requirements of the IraqGovernment.may he concerned, it will&quot;be necessary to await the reply tothe proposed telegram to the HighCommissioner of Iraq.(5) The proposal to connect Haifa by rail with Tripoli ia prima faciedesirable.   Any further points on which Palestine is interestedmust await the views of the HighCommissioner for Palestine, towhom it is suggested that the telegram referred to in paragraph3 of the Sub-Commi11 ee&apos; s Repo rt,should be repeated.In the course of the discussion the Firstlord of the Admiralty developed in detail theAdmiralty point of vie^ as set forth generally in the Memorandum by the Chief of the Naval Staffappended to Paper CP.-136 (30)), and pointed outthat the earlier Report of the Committee of Chiefsof Staff did not confirm the view expressed inthe Report of the Cabinet Committee to the effectthat a pipeline terminating in Haifa could not be defended against- attack from Syria *It was pointed out that, apart from the supplyof oil in time of war, the adoption of Tripolias the terminal of the oil pipeline would, in time ^ peace, tend to give the French Government astrong hold on the oil supplies of Iraq and.thereby greatly strengthen their political position in the Near East.    In any negotiations,therefore, it was especially import-ant to securethat there should be no restriction on the exportof oil to British ports .While general regret was expressed that thefacts set forth in the Report of the CabinetCommittee were adverse to the establishment:of the
9 9terminus of the pipeline at Haifa, the Cabinet(a) That there was no alternative butto accept the policy proposed inthe Report of the Cabinet Committeeand to make the best settlementpossible with the French Govern-m ent:(b) That, before any communicationwas made to the French Government,a telegram on the lines of thedraft appended to the Report of the e Int er-Departrn ent al C ommitt e e(Paper CP.-141 (30)  (Appendix)should be sent to the HighCommissioner of Iraq and his   ,reply awaited:(c) That the reply of the HighCommissioner in Iraq,  as soonas received, should be trans-mitted to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, who expectedto be at Geneva until Monday,May 19th, and that the Secretaryof State should then enter intopreliminary conversations on thesubject with M. Briand.
5. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to several oases that had recently occurred ofleak? ge to the Press of Cabinet decisions or ofthe contents of secret documents co-municated tothe Cabinet, some of which had been circulatedunder the sare precautions as are taken in thecase of Cabinet Minutes.    In one case, namely,the decision of the Cabinet to approve theGovernment of india propos? 1 to arrest Mr Gandhi,the possible consequences of the leakage hadbeen so serious that steps had been taken,under threat of prosecution, to ascertain the source from which certain newspapers had derivedthe information.   This investigation indicated-the desirability that all persons in possessionof Cabinet secrets should avoid answering any questions whatsoever, whether apparently innocentor not, by Pressmen and others in regard to cabinet business..The Prime Minister appealed to his colleagues to observe this rule.
INDIA.The proposed conference.(PreviousReferencCabinet 24(30),. Con-clusior   4(d) .)6..The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (Paper C.P.-138 (30)), prepared at the request made by theCabinet at. the Meeting referred to in the margin,containing full information bearing on the Termsof Reference to the coming Conference with repre-sentstives o^ different parties and interests inEritish India and representatives of the indian states,  and suggesting that some such announcementas the following should be made:-&quot;(i) The goal of the British Govern-ment&apos;s policy is the attainment of Dominion Status by India, andthe Conference is called to assistthe Government in consideration of measures towards the achievement of this end,(ii) Representatives at the conference will be completely free to advocateany proposals for the realisation of Great Britain&apos;s declared policy that they may desire to advance.The deliberations of the conference will take place in the light of allthe material available.(iii) Though it is impossible to restrict the liberty of Parliament,  any measure of unanimity at the Con-ference would necessarily carryweight with the Government and parliament&quot;.In his Memorandum the Secretary of State also askedfor a decision in regard to meeting the cost ofthe arrangements of the Conference.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forIndia should inform the Viceroythat the Cabinet are beginning to consider the question o^ theTerms of Reference to the IndianConference, and should invite his views:(b)That the question of the&apos; cost ofthe Conference should be discussed between the Secretary of State forIndia and the Chancellor of the-xcheoue&quot;&quot;.

lp-The Cabinet bad under consideration amemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,(Paper No. CP.  1 if (j)0) ) , on the question of policywhich has arisen in respect of the copper suppliesof the United Kingdom and the recent discovery of very large copper deposits in Northern Rhodesia.In the early part of the memorandum the conditionsof the world copper market, which, it was pointedout,  is at present under American control, were described.      The reasons for the dependence of theUnited Kingdom copper-using industries uponforeign supplies of material was explained.      Itwas then pointed out that the situation as to theworld supplies of copper ore is likely to be verymatJrially altered by recent disooveries of depositsin Northern Rhodesia,  the significance of which itwas hardly possible to exaggerate.After describing the position as to thecontrol of the mining concessions in northern rhodesia,  the memorandum went on to explain that theImperial Smelting Corporation, a combination ofBritish and Australian non-ferrous metal interests,,is contemplating the erection of a large copperrefinery in the United Kingdom,  if satisfactory arrangements can be made to secure an adequate and permanent supply of raw material.      It had accordingly been suggested that that supply, withthe resultant development of a new and importantindustry in this country,  the strengthening of theposition of the British copper-using industries by the    lessening of their dependence on American-
controlled supplies, and a great improvementin the position from the point of.view of nationaldefence,  could best he secured by the absoluteprohibition of the export of copper ore.or rawcopper from Northern Rhodesia except for treatmentwithin the British Empire.As the decision required involves considerationsregarding employment, defence and the Colonies as/ell as trade and industry, it was suggestedin the memorandum that the matter should be referred,to a Cabinet Committee.The Cabinet agreed  That the Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade should beconsidered by the following CabinetComioittee:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The President of the Board of Trade.

Your second telegram, unnumbered of Hay 6th.Judging from your telegram unnumbered just receivedthere was obviously some error in transmission of Egyptianproposal referred to, as despatched by you yesterdaymorning.      Text of Egyptian proposal was substantially asfollows.Begins -Yifhile reserving liberty to conclude new conventionsin future modifying conventions of 1899 and settlingSoudan question High Contracting Parties agree that without prejudice to Egypt&apos;s rights and material inter-este status of Soudan shall be that resulting from saidconventions.

Decypher of telegram from Governor GeneralxI Khartum) to Secretary of State for &quot;Foreign AffalrScD. 7.5 a.m. 7th May 1930.R,    9.8 a.m.    7th May 1930.Your second telegram unnumbered of May 6th.The new formula now proposed seems to us infinitelymore dangerous since in contingent promise to enter intofriendly discussions within year there is clearly impliedintention to agree to some modification of present position!and to stigmatise the latter as being merely a temporary arrangements which both parties have agreed should be up set in the near future.    The result will inevitably beunsettlement and intrigue in Sudan.Should discussions in spite of this have to take place it is in your view essential to retain our power on an issue so vital as that of Sudan and we would beg thatfirst no clause in treaty with Egypt should be signed untildiscussions regarding Sudan are finally completed and secondly that note referring to one Egyptian battalionshould be cancelled pending outcome of discussions.    Thelatter provision would appear in   any case to follow fromlatest wording suggested by you for Article 13, but we wishto make point clear because in this crisis it is essentialto retain every card in our hands.Addressed to Foreign Office unnumbered.     repeated to Cairo Mo. 81.
