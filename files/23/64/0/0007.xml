APPENDIX.C A BINE T.182J30J..IRAQ, TREATY NEGOTIATIONS.Me mo randum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The following heads of policy on the question of theposition of the British Forces in Iraq after 1932, whenIraq enters the League of Nations,  are suggested by LordThomson and myself for consideration by the Cabinet  :-(1) The view of the High Commissioner that, even in opposition to the wishes of the Iraq Government,  a british force must be retained in Central Iraq,  If not permanently,at any rate for the duration of the new Treaty, should notbe accepted.Under the High Commissioner^ proposal we should remain morally responsible for maintaining internal security in Iraq without either legal sanction or adequate means fordischarging that responsibility.      Moreover, whereas theretention of a force in Central Iraq might be desirable incertain circumstances (e.g.,  If the good will of the Ir^qGovernment were assured,  and their had shown themselvescapable of maintaining internal order unassisted),  such anarrangement would be indefensible in the face of hostilityby the Iraq Government,  or in the absence of evidence thatthe Iraq Government could manage their own affairs without our assistance.(2) The Iraq Government should be offered the following&quot;arrangement.      The Royal Air Force to remain at Hinaidi forthe first five years after the entry Into force of the
Treaty and at the expiration of that period (i.e. 1937),if the Iraq Government so desired,  to withdraw to Basra,or, with the consent of the Iraq Government, to acquire, inaddition to Basra, another station possessing a betterclimate, such as Habbaniya, the process of withdrawal in either case tc be completed so soon as alternative accommodation was available and within a period not exceeding three years  (i.e., by 1940).(N.B. The period might possibly be reduced to two years ifthe Iraq Government pressed for this.)The above proposal would allow time to test the stability of the Iraqi Administration and the local Governmentsability to preserve internal order.     At the end *f the fiveyears&apos; period His ?.&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government would be in a positionto judge whether their forces In Iraq could safely be divided between Central and Southern Iraq, or whether It would be wiser to concentrate those forces at Basra.(3) A permanent lease of an air and seaplane base atBasra must in any case be obtained from the Iraq Government.In the interests of Imperial defence, It is essential thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should be assured permanent occupationof an air base at the head of the Persian Gulf.(4) The arrangement with the Iraq Government should provide that Iraq would contribute to the cost of the alternative accommodation required by the Royal Air Force on withdrawing from Hinaidi,  the contribution taking the form of compensationfor the cantonments, etc. to be relinquished by the Royal AirForce at Hinaidi and Mosul, which were constructed at the costof Imperial funds.P.Colonial Office.27th May,   1930.
