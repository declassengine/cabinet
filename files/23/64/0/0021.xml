telegrams exchanged between the Secretary ofState for India and the Viceroy (CP.-366 (30))on the subject of the participation of theOpposition Parties in the Round-Table Conference.The Viceroy still adhered to his view that adecision at this stage to announce the inclusionof the Opposition Parties would mean trouble atthe Indian end, but, realising the difficultiesat this end, he discussed what could be done to minimise the damage.The Secretary of State for India explainedthat the above telegrams had only been circulated for information and he asked for no decision.The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinetthat he had received a letter from Sir John Simonfrom which he gathered that there was a move incertain quarters to secure that Sir John should attend the Round-Table Conference, not as arepresentative of any Party, but merely to enable him to participate.   He hoped to see Sir John thesame day.   He asked for no decision except thatthe Cabinet should leave the matter to him andthe Secretary of State for India.The Cabinet agreed to the PrimeMinister&apos;s proposal.

,IA.previousjeference:cabinet 38jjo), Con-conclusion   5) ,3.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read a communication he had received on the previous day from the Ambassador of Soviet Russiareiterating the rejection of the proposal inregard to Sub-committee D and commenting that until the existing difference of view betweenthe two Governments is eliminated the fixing ofthe date of meeting of the Conference would be premature.      The Secretary of State said hehad seen M.  Sokolnikoff the same morning andhad failed to move him from his position,  onwhich he had received precise instructions.After discussion the Cabinet agreed -That,  in view of the importanceof not allowing the negotiations to break down on a point of form,the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised tomake the best arrangement he canwith the Ambassador of SovietRussia, on the clear understand-ing that when the Report of Sub-Committee D is passed throughthe main Committee to the pleni-potentiaries,  the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs willnot accept any departure fromthe Sub-Committee1s Report whichmight be recommended by the main committee, without consulting theCabinet.
4. The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Home Secretary (C.P .-258 ( SO))consulting them once more in regard to thequestion of admitting V. Leon Trotsky to thiscountry.   The present application did not comefrom K. Trotsky himself, but from Miss Wilkinson..M.&quot;?., who, apparently a^ter consultation withcertain Members  of the House of Commons, had written to the Home Secretary urging that M.Trotskyshould be allowed to come here for medical reasons.No evidence was produced to show that IV&apos;,. Trotskywas in need of medical attention, or that,  ifhe is, he could obtain it only in this country.The Cabinet agreed  To leave the question with theHome Secretary, with an expression of opinion that no grounds hadbeen adduced for altering their previous attitude.
99 s)THF NEW 5- The Cabinet had before thes the Report ofHEBRIDES .the Cabinet Committee on the New Hebrides(previous (C.P.-259 (50)), the recommendations of which reference:Cabinet 32 are summarised in the last paragraph o:F the(SO), Con-elusion 10.) Report as follows:-(i) That United Kingdom interestsin the New Hebrides are so smallat the present time that we donot feel justified in recommend-ing the expenditure of any further capital.(ii) That,  in our opinion, the be3tsolution o^ the present dif^i-culties would be for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment either in the Common-wealth o* Australia or New zealand to agree to take over our share o.fthe Condominium&apos;    it is to be observed that Australian interests are greater than those o^&apos; theUnited Kingdom, both becauseAustralia has a larger share o^the tr*de and because the majorityo^ the British settlers areAustralians .(iii) That this proposal might convenience-ently be discussed at the forth-coming Imperial Conference,  andthat, in the meantime, theGovernments of the commonwealth and New Zealand .-,iight be informedo^ this suggestion by cable inorder that their representatives at the Imperial Conference may beacquainted with the vievs of theirrespective Governments beforesailing   &apos;or England.    If this isnot done,  it lay be difficult toget r  definite decision at thetime required.(iv) That,  if this proposal should prove impracticable,  the suggestion thatthe New Hebrides be constituted aMandated Territory under thecontrol of France should be explored with the commonwealth and New Zealand representatives&quot;i^&quot; should be explained to themthat,  failing this,  it would seernecessary to choose between -rain-taining the status quo, with theliability for increased expenditure,and withdrawal in favour of France on the best te-ms available.The Cabinet approved the above recou.rend-ations .
6,   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury,circulated by direction of the Prime Minister,(C.P.--260 ( 30)) suggesting that the Government&apos;slegislative programmes for the coming  sessions should be mapped out so as to admit of the intro-duction o&quot;p measures roughly in accordance with a table dividing the Session into four periods.    Inthe Me; orandu;- it was further suggested that theCabinet should determine what major Bills are tobe taken next Session, as well as their order of introduction, so that three . ajor Bills  (two forStanding Committees first,  and then one for the floor of the House) may be entered, upon immedi-ately after the Debate on the Address is concludedon the 5th November.    It was further suggestedthat the Home Affairs Committee might be requestedbefore the holidays to arrange provisionally inorde^ of importance a list of second-class and minor Bills .After considerable discussion the Cabinetreached the following decisions:-(a) Provisional.    That members of theCabinet should, reserve September17th,  lath and 19th for Meetingsof the Cabinet, with a view topreparation for the ImperialConference,   &apos;*hile the taking of other business during these three days was not excluded,it was realised, that furtherMeetings in connection with theParliamentary situation would berequired subsequently:(b) That before September 17th theCommittee of Home Affairs should prepare a Report for the Cabinetin regard to the classification of the various Bills  (major and.minor) proposed for the forth-coming Session:
(c) That the actual date of proro-gation of Parliament could not finally be fixed until thefollowing day, but that the prorogation Order should providefor the opening of the next session on October 28th:(d) That the Lord Chancellor shouldedit the draft of the King&apos;sProrogation Speech for considera-tion by the Cabinet at an earlydate.
o ^ oa a oEE MIDDLEAST .previous reference:Cabinet 4928)    Con-conclusion 1.)7. The Cabinet had under consideration a Noteby the Secretary (CP ..-252 (30)) covering theReport of a Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence (CI.D. Paper No. 174-D) contain-ing recommendations as to the methods by whichthe existing machinery for political control inArabia could be simplified and speeded up.   Itwas explained in the covering Note that theCommittee of Imperial Defence had approved generally the recommendations contained in Part I of theReport, dealing with existing political arrange-ments in the Persian Gulf.   As regards Part II,however, the Committee had recommended &quot;That thequestion of transferring to the Foreign Office thegeneral control of our relations with the wholeof the territories in the Middle East should be reserved for consideration by the Cabinet .&quot;After discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (l) As regards part II of the Report,that when Iraq is admitted to theLeague of Nations in 1932, theresponsibility for our relationswith that country will be trans-ferred from the Colonial Officeto the Foreign Office, and preparations for this transfershould, be made between the Depart-ments&quot; concerned:(II) As, regards Part I of the Report,to approve the recommendationsof the Committee,  amended asfollows:--8-
(a) Two Standing Co-ordinating committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence,the one ministerial and the otherofficial, should be set up to dealwith such Middle East questions asconcern two or more Departments .(b) The composition of the ministerial sub-Committee should be:-The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for theColonies .The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for Air.The First Lord of the Admiralty;with a Secretary from theCommittee of Imperial DefenceSecretariat.(NOTE: The Cabinet added the Chancelleryof the Exchequer.)(c) The composition of the official Sub-Committee should be:-Chairman:    To be nominated by theColonial Office.Members:      Representatives of theTreasury, Foreign Office,War Office, India Office,Air Ministry and Admiralty,with a Secretary from theCommittee of Imperial DefenceSecretariat.(NOTE:    The Cabinet added a representativeof the Treasury.)(d) Meetings of the above committees should be summoned only as and when required by one or other of the interested Departments for the examination of a specific problem(or problems).   Further, the minis-terial Committee need not, generallyspeaking, be troubled to assembleexcept  (i) to deal with questions uponwhich the official Committeefail to reach agreement&apos;    or(ii) to reconsider recommendationsof the official Committee which any Minister concerned findshimself unable to approve.(e) Local Authorities should be giventhe greatest possible latitude onall questions.: particularly those relating to the establishment andmaintenance of the air route.9 9 n
*1 T* O-J 3 o(g) There rhould he the eloaest co-operation between the resident in the Persian Gulf and the air officer commanding in Iraq.   Theformer should  (i) be empowered to apply direct to the latter for air assist-ance;    and(li) make as much use as possible of such facilities for histransportation by air as theAir Officer commanding inIraq can make available.(NOTE.:    In this connection attention was drawn to the following recommend-ation by the Committee of ImperialDefence:-That &quot;It is important that theCommander-in-Chief, East IndiesSquadron, and the Senior naval officer, Persian Gulf, shouldbe made acquainted beforehandwith all operations which maybe contemplat ed or undertaken by air forces in the Gulf&quot;.)(ill) Conclusion (f), namely, that&quot;It would be of great advantage tothe Air Ministry if all questions concerning the air route were dealtwith by the same Department inLondon&quot;,was not accepted, and, in order to give time to the Secretary of State for Indiato consult the Indian Government, thefollowing were reserved for considers-tion at the next Meeting of the Cabinet:-(h) The Resident, Persian Gulf, should,in view of the growing importanceof the Arab littoral, have his head-quarters, if possible, on the Arab,and not the Persian, side of theGulf.(i) Consideration might, with advantage,be given to the following questions in regard to the appointment of the resident in the Persian Gulf:-(i) Should the appointment be made more attractive from the pointof view of prestige and remuneration?(ii) Should the field of selectionbe extended beyond its presentrestricted limits?(iii) Should the Imperial Governmenthave a greater say in theappointment?
ii 9THE IMPERIALCONFERENCE,1930.Repres ent a-tion of the unit edKingdom .(previous reference:Cabinet 5(30),  Con-elusion 9.)8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(C.P.-S49 (30))  containing the following suggestions in regard to representation of the United kingdom at the Imperial Conference,  19 30:-(a) For political and general questions:The Prinze Minister.The Lord Chancellor.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State forForeign- A-ff^irs .The Secretary of State forDoirinion Affairs .(b) For economic questions:The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.The President o^ the Eoard ofTrade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer(or the Financial Secretary tothe Treasury) .(c) That/the Secretary of State for theColonies should sit as a separatemember of the Imperial Conference,representative of the Colonies andProtectorstes and the A and B mandated territories,  and that the cabinet should&apos; formally approve of any necessary action being taken, atthe time of the Conference, witha view to giving effect to thisarrang em ent .S(d) That the Secretary of State for India,as at previous Conferences, shouldhead the Indian Delegation.(e) That other United Kingdom ministers should be asked,  as at formerConferences, to attend particularmeetings when matters of special interest to them come up fordiscussion.The Cabinet approved the above proposals,subject to the Secretary of State for theColonies being added only to the list ofrepresentatives  &quot;for Economic questions&quot;under heading  (b),  although, of course,he would have the same privileges as other United Kingdom Ministers underheading (e) .
THE- COAL mines bill.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(30), Con-elusion 1.)9.   The President of the Board of trade reported that he had seen the Leader of theConservative Party in the House of Lords on theprevious evening, and there was now no doubt thatwhen the amendments to the Coal Mines Bill, passedunanimously on Monday evening by the House ofCommons,  came before the House of Lords, lord salisbury would propose a further addendum, tothe effect that the purpose of the approval.(i.e., of the Mining Association and the Miners&apos;Federation) is to secure that the application isaccording to the unfettered decisions of therepresentatives of the workers aforesaid.After hearing a full exposition of thesituation from the President of the Board ofTrade, and some criticisms of the Government&apos;policy by the Lord&quot;Privy Seal, the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Lord Chancellor, in theHouse of Lords, while making itclear that the Government were under no illusions as to their position in the House of Lords, .where the majority might be as great as 200 to 20, should pointout that in regard to the amend-in ent now proposed to the &quot;spread-over&quot; he was no longer the spokesman merely of a minorityGovernment but of a united Houseof Commons, and that in thesecircumstances the Governmentcould not accept the amendment:(b) That the President of the Boardof Trade should consult with theMiner Members of Parliament- andwith representatives of theExecutive of the Miners&apos; federation and explain to them the view ofthe legal advisers to the Governmentthat Lord Salisbury&apos;s amendmentcould be accepted without any.risk of the Board of Trade andprobably none of the Miners&apos;Federation being brought intoCourt before next summer (whenthe 7-hours day will be resumedautomatically, under existing legislation) owing to a decisionof the Miners&apos;  Federation against an..application f*rom a district:
mm(c) Should the Miner Members ofParliament and the Miners&apos;Federation be agreeable, thiswould enable the Government,in the last resort, to acceptLord Salisbury&apos;s amendment if adopted by the House of Lords,which the Cabinet agreed wouldbe preferable to the loss ofthe Bill.-13-
10. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (0*P.-S47 (SO)) renewingthe request he had made in C.P.-216 (30) fo^ an assurance that time would be found for legislationnext Session on the subject of the co-ordinationof London passenger transport.    On this occasion the Minister&apos;s request was reinfoi&quot;ced by an accounto^ negotiations which have begun between the underground Company (the holding Company of thecombine) and the Metropolitan Railway company with a view to the control of the latter Companybeing acquired by the f ors sr., - negotiations which,i^ carried through, would probably result in alarge increase in the price which the proposedTraffic Authority would have to pay for the Metro-polit^n Railway undertaking .   A^ter giving: other reasons in support of his proposal, the minister asked his colleagues to decide- that a LondonTraffic Bill should be included in the King&apos;sSpeech next Session, and that authority should begiven to him to make the necessary announcement asto the decision of the Government to go forward,in order that he may enter upon negotiations firmlyand confidently with the interests concerned.While the Cabinet were entirely sympathetic to the proposals of the Tinister of Transport,they found it. impossible to give him the decisionfor which he asked until the major Bills to beintroduced in the forthcoming Session of Parliament
(The Prime Minister withdrew, in orderto keep an official engagement, and theChancellor of the Exchequer took the chair*)(a) That when, in September, theCommittee of Home Affairs is considering the order of priority of the various Bills,they should give carefulconsideration to the Ministerof TransportVs case In favourof the London Traffic Bill:(b) That before the. next Meeting ofthe Cabinet the Minister ofTransport should examine thequestion of whether there is any means by which he couldenter upon negotiations withthe interests concerned without- the necessity of announcing thata London Traffic Bill would beincluded in the King&apos;s Speechnext Session.
PREFERENCE OFEMPLOYMENT INGOVERNMENTDEPARTMENTSTO EX-REGULARSOLDIERS.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(30), Con-clusion 10.)11. The Cabinet had before them a Note bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-263 (30))stating that he had discussed the question of theemployment of ex-regular soldiers under theOffice of Works with the First Commissioner ofWorks and had reached the conclusion that thearrangements prescribed by Treasury Circular 1/30of the 1st January, 19 30, shall no longer be held to apply to the recruitment of industrial employees(skilled and unskilled workmen) to the Office ofWorks.The Cabinet took note of theab ov e.
THE LANDVALUATIONBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(30), Con-elusion 13.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 23, 1930.Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP .-264 (30))covering a revised Land Valuation Bill whichhad been modified as the result of suggestions made by the Lord President of the Council and colonel Wedgwood, M.P.   Though the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer did not pretend that the Bill even now was satisfactory, in order to give an earnest of good faith in the matter he proposed to publish the Bill, prefacing the publication by an answer to the effect that he was circulating the Billfor the information of Members and that he wouldbe ready to consider any suggestions which might reach him in regard to the Bill before the time comes for its re-introduction next Session.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Chancellor of the exchequer to publish the Bill, but, in viewof the objections likely to betaken by owners of agricultural land to the expense which would fall on them, in connection withvaluation, the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries asked theChancellor of the Exchequer tomake his answer as non-committaland provisional as possible.
Copy of Cypher telegram to Sir P. Loraine (Cairo),Foreign Office, 23rd July, 1930, 4.43 p.m.No. 247.*      *     *Your telegrams Nos.  347 and 352 (of July 22nd).His Majesty&apos;s Government have no desire or intentionto be drawn into Egyptian internal politics.      This wehave made plain from the beginning.The King is aware that we desire to conclude atreaty with a representative government:    for this andother reasons we should welcome the reconciliation re-ferred to in paragraph 5 of your first telegram under reference.      We should also be glad to see a sane and efficient administration, uninfluenced by any vindictive-ness as a result of the recent troubles.      There isfurther our present responsibility for and interest inthe protection of foreign lives and property, which weshould be ultimately bound to safeguard.      More thanthat His Majesty&apos;s Government are not now prepared tosay.If it were at all possible we should welcomereconciliation before the 26th when, by our reading ofArticle 40, it seems that either the constitution mustbe violated or an impossible situation arise.      We shall of course understand if you think that this is not yetwithin the bounds of possibility, but we have gathered from your telegram No. 352 that &quot;discreet mediation&quot; maybe practicable at no distant date.
