parliamentary procedure./previous reference:Cabinet 31(30), Con-elusion 8.)2.  The Cabinet had. before thai., the following documents in regard to the Hours of Meeting and rising       the Kouse:-The Report of the Select Committee(Paper CP.-185 (SO))  circulatedby direction of the Prime Minister,expressing the opinion that thequestion of the hours of meeting and rising is only an infinitesimalpart of a vide and pressing probleminto which enquiry must be made asa whole;    stating that, notwith-standing. the preponderance of theevidence actually given against any change at all, the Committeeare convinced that there existsa strong feeling among ;Members infavour o^ a normally earlier hourof meeting and rising;    and recom-mending that Governments should be strongly discouraged from suspendingfurther,andthe 11 o&apos;clock Rule;    and,that the normal hours of meetingrising on Fridays should be changed to 10 o&apos;clock and 3 o&apos;clock respec-tively, and that the Standing orders should be amended accordingly:A Memorandum by the Parliam entarySecretary to the Treasury (paper cp.-198 (SO)),  circulated Lydirection of the Prime Minister,criticising the Select Committee&apos;srecommendations and suggesting that-one of the most effective ways ofrelieving congestion would be tomake more use of procedure inStanding Coramittees,The Cabinet agreed --(a) To accept the recommendation ofthe Select Committee that the hoursof sitting on Fridays should be from10 a.m. to 3 p.rc.:(b) To approve the proposal for an inquiry by Select Committee intothe machinery for transactingParliamentary business, the exactTerms of Reference to be examined at the next Meeting of the Cabinet.
3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury(Paper CP.-199 (30)),  circulated by directionof the Prime Minister, showing the position ofParliamentary business on June 6, 1930.   Attachedto the Memorandum were tables showing in detailthree courses open to the Government.   Course Iinvolved the prorogation of Parliament this summer,  and on the assurr.ption that the cabinet authorised the dropping of Bills which have no chance of passage this Session, the Session mightbe concluded at earliest on August 5th.   The next session (11th November, 1930, to 31st July, 1931)would provide for legislation roughly 42 full days and 6 Fridays^   Course II suggested the prolongation-tion of the Session un^il the 19th December, whichwould admit of an earlier date of rising for the summer Recess, possibly the 30th July.    In this event the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurysuggested that Parliament should re-assemble onthe 4th November until the 19th December.   the effective time for legislation would admit of thecompletion of all the postponed Bills and would leave 9 full days and 2 Fridays for new work.The next Session (27th January, 1931, to 31stJuly, 1931), with the 9 days and 2 Fridays gainedthis Session, would be equivalent to 41 days and Fridays for legislative purposes.    Course III,which was a compromise between Courses I and II,suggested adjournment on the 6th August, re-ass embly on the 21st October, prorogation, say,on the 13th November, and opening the new session on the 25th November.   The nev Session (25thNovember, 1930, to 31st July,  1931) would afford
43 days and 8 Fridays .    The Parliamentary Secre-tary to the Treasury preferred Course II as being on the whole the most economical of Parliamentaryt im e.Prolonged discussion took place on the above proposals, and the difficulties of adopting anyone of the three courses were reviewed with special reference to the fate of the Education Bill, the consumers&apos;  Council Bill, the Trade Disputes bill and any emergency legislation likely to be necessaryfor dealing with Unemployment.In the course of the discussion the suggestion was made that there might be some advantage: inthe Prime Minister consulting the Leaders of theOpposition Parties before reaching a decision, andthe importance of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for home Affairs keeping, in touch with the ConsultativePar 1 iam ent aryCommittee of the/Labour Party was emphasised.The Cabinet agreed ,To adjourn the consideration ofthe subject to the next Meetingof the Cabinet .

CHINA. 6. The Secretary of State for foreign affairs stated that the condition of China continued to&apos; previous reference: cause a great deal of concern, owing to theCabinet 15(30), Con-. prevailing anarchy and the disturbance to ourelusion 2.)trading relations .   Various suggestions were under.consideration fo^ relieving the situation.Visitors from this country who had recentlyreturned from China were urging the transference of the British Legation from Peking to Nanking,Another course suggested was the despatch of a mission by the League of Nations.   He was also being urged to send to China a trade deputation,similar to that to South America headed by lord&apos;Abernon.   He himself was inclined to askSir Miles Lamps on to come to London in order todiscuss fully with him the whole Chinese situation.The Cabinet took note of thestatement by the secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.

The Cabinet had before them the Report ofthe Committee of the Economic Advisory Council onthe Cotton Industry (Paper CP.-208 (30)),circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.Section II of the Report briefly compared theposition of the Lancashire Cotton Industry in1914 with that in which it found itself today,and gave some account of the increase of foreigncompetition which has led to the present position.Section III was devoted to a description of thepresent organisation of the several sections ofthe Industry.    Section IV discussed the need for technical re-equipment in the spinning and manu-facturing sections.    Section V considered thepossible means of securing closer co-operationbetween employers and operatives on questions ofcommon interest.    Section VI referred to recentmovements within the industry towards amalgama-tions and indicated the views of the Committeeon the need for re-organisation.The Conclusions and Recommendations of theCommittee are reproduced in Appendix I to these minutes .The Cabinet considered the question of publica-tion of the Cotton Report, and in relation theretothe publication of the Iron and Steel Report.It was generally agreed that the two Reports mustbe dealt with separately in regard to publication,-ft-
The Cabinet agreed  To ask the Hose Secretary, as chairman o^ the Cotton Committee,to discuss the question of publi-cation of the Cotton Report withthe Joint Committee of Cotton trade organisations.
IRAQ,- p* T:tie Cabinet had before them a Note by the[policy in. Secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper C.P.-minister,0posed 207 (30))  circulating for the consideration ofjreaty.his colleagues a fttrther Memorandum prepared xnIlprevious his Department on the subject of the Iraq TreatyReference:Cabinet 30 Negotiations .    Since the Meeting of the Cabinet(30),  Con-elusion 2.) mentioned in the margin the situation had altered:King Peisal had modified his plans and now pro-posed to remain in Iraq until the 23rd June..   TheHigh Commissioner had reported that he was hopeful that the negotiations might be brought to a success-ful issue before King? Peisal leaves for Europe,provided that certain outstanding points could be disposed of in the meantime.   The Colonial Officerecommended that the High Commissioner should begiven authority to negotiate with the Iraq Govern-ment on the following basis:-(i) The duration of the Treaty to be fora period of twenty-five years and aprovision to be included in the treaty on the lines of the draft Article inAppendix B:(ii) All mention of liability for the costof providing alternative accommodation for the R.A.P. to be omitted from theTreaty, but an exchange of notes to be concluded and appended to the Treaty,placing it on record that all outstand-ing financial questions,  including thosewhich it is necessary to settle for thepurposes of the operation of the treaty and the Military Appendix, will form thesubject of a separate agreement whichshall be deemed to be an integral partof the Treaty and shall be ratified atthe same time:(iii) The Iraq Government to grant to HisMajesty&apos;s Government, at a nominalrental, a lease, for the duration ofthe Treaty,  of sites ^or land and sea-plane bases at Basra:(iv) British forces to be withdrawn fromMosul and Hinaidi within a maximum period of five years a^ter the entry into force of the Treaty, and theTreaty to include a provision on thelines of the draft Article in AppendixC .
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs expressed general agreement with the proposalsof the Colonial Office, subject to one or twominor modifications.The Secretary of State for Air desired to substitute the word &quot;permanent&quot; for &quot;continued&quot;&apos;in Appendix B, line 5, and this was accepted byLord Passfield.In reply to the Chancellor of the ExchequerLord Pass field stated that financial matters werereserved for future agreement, and that whereas the procedure now recommended might be held to weaken somewhat the Treasury position, formallyTreasury rights were protected.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the High commissioner to negotiate with the Iraq government -ment on the basis of the recommenda-tions of the Colonial Office as setout above.
Situation in. by the Secretary of Stnte for the Colonies (PaperAttitude of CP.-206 (30)) on the subject of the.situation inthe Vatican.Malta, drawing attention to the domestic and(previous Constitutional reactions produced in Malta by reference:Cabinet 25 the Command Paper recently presented to Parlia-(30), Con-oltision 3.) ment by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffair?.    These reactions were so serious as tomake it desirable that, as a purely temporary measure, the Maltese Constitution should be suspended and Crown Colony government established.The Secretary of State therefore sought theauthority of the Cabinet to take the necessary steps.   He vas advised that legal sanction couldbe obtained   by prerogative legislation, and he proposed to submit the necessary draft Instrumentsto His Majesty in Council as early as possible.The. Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for the Colonies(a) for the temporary suspension of the Maltese Constitution:(b) for the substitution of CrownC olony g ov ernro ent:(c) for the retention in being ofthe Executive Council, withthe right of the Governor to consult it, to refrain fromconsulting it, and to act in opposition to its advice:(d) for the taking of powers to validate acts of the Legislaturenow dissolved, should this befound necessary as the resulto^ Judgments by the MalteseCourts on certain actions nowpending.

-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT.&quot;82APPENDIX I.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE ECONOMIC ADVISORYCOUNCIL. ON THE COTTON INDUSTRY.CONCLUSIONS.We summarise our general conclusions as follows: (i) Since before the war the world consumption of cotton piece-goods appears to have risen, but the yardage of such goods exported from Great Britain is now less than two^thirds of what it was in1910-13.(ii) By far the most serious losses of trade are those in the exportof coarse standard lines of cotton piece-goods. The information available from the trade returns does not enable precise figures to begiven for these lines of goods. It may be noted, however, that the exports of grey unbleached piece-goods, which in 1913 amounted to2,357,492 thousand linear yards, had fallen by 1924 to 1,402,27Sthousand linear yards. Since that da,te there has been a progressivedecline, exports in 1929 falling as low as 954,823 thousand linearyards. The exports of prints also have fallen from 1,230,754 thousandin 1913 to 551,706 yards last year.(iii) Losses in the export trade have not been confined to thecoarse standard lines, and there are increasing indications thatcompetition is becoming keener in all classes of cotton piece-goods,including the finer and more varied lines.(iv) The markets in which Lancashire has suffered the mostserious losses are those in the Par East, particularly India, China and japan.As regards India, the large falling off of cotton goods exported from Lancashire is, in the main, due to an increase in the productionof cotton goods in India, but also partly to Japanese competition.Outside India, the most formidable competition is from Japan.The Japanese cotton industry has grown sufficiently powerful not onlyto supply its home market, but also to develop a formidable export business, largely at the expense of Lancashire. Japanese cotton goods are at present mainly exported to the eastern markets, but theJapanese are extending their export trade to more distant countries,e.g., to East Africa.(v) Until far-reaching improvements are introduced into theBritish industry, there is no likelihood that Lancashire will be ableto arrest the decline in her export trade, still less that she willrecover the trade which she has lost.(vi) The organisation of the Lancashire cotton industry, with theexception of the finishing section, is substantially the same as thatwhich existed in the nineteenth century, but her successful foreignrivals in world trade have adopted a very different method of organisation. Their system is based on the establishment of the closest relations between production and marketing.(vii) The marketing of Lancashire piece-goods isi at presentconducted almost exclusively on the basis of the acceptance of ordersthat are individually profitable to the merchant concerned without regard to the needs of production or to the economies that may beachieved in standard goods by mass production and long runs.(viii) To enable the manufacture of standard goods once more tobe energetically developed, Lancashire requires a marketing systemso organised as to secure a steady outlet for goods produced by themost economic methods.(ix) The cost of production of cotton goods in Lancashire is substantially higher than that in the countries which offer her themost serious competition. If that competition is to be met, it isessential that the employers and operatives in all sections of theindustry should reduce costs and increase efficiency by concerted action.[21090a]nRBEHMiflnl
(x) There are three possible ways by which these two purposesmay be approached, namely, (a) the technical improvement of the spinning and manufacturing sections, involving considerable re-equip-ment; (fc) the formation of larger units within each section of theindustry; (c) the extension of co-operative effort on the linesinitiated by the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations.These methods are interrelated, and it is not to be expected thatany one of them by itself could be effective.(xi) In the preceding conclusions we have endeavoured to state the various remedies that it is open to Lancashire herself to apply toher present troubles. There is no alternative method of recovery.The system which brought prosperity to the Cotton Industry is to-daymanifestly inadequate to meet the strain of modern conditions. Anew world has emerged from the chaos created by the war, and thegreat losses that Lancashire has since suffered are in large part dueto an attempt to conduct its industry on pre-war lines and to a refusal to recognise that the old conditions, so favourable to Lancashire, have passed away for ever. Recent years of adversity have, however,given some proof that the leaders of Lancashire realise the gravity of the situation and the need for new methods to cope with it. Thenecessary measures for re-organisation are known and the financerequired is available.The well-being of the Cotton Industry is more than the concern of Lancashire herself. It is of vital interest to the country as a whole.No nation could tolerate the neglect of hopeful means of recoverywhen confronted with the decline of so important an export industry with the burden of hardship and misery which such a decline mustmean to the workers whose employment is destroyed. The crisis is urgent and immediate action is imperative. We are confident thatthe organised operatives and employers of Lancashire will embarkforthwith upon the serious consideration of the measures essential tothe recovery of their trade. If, however, this hope is disappointed,or if any section proves recalcitrant, we think it right to place on record our considered view that it would be the duty of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment themselves to consider inviting Parliament to conferupon them any necessary powers.RECOMMENDATIONS.In the light of the foregoing conclusions, we recommend thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should take every step in their power to urge on the employers and operatives in Lancashire the importanceof considering the following possible means of reducing the costs ofproduction and recovering the lost export trade in cotton goods. Theyare methods which have proved of economic value to Lancashire&apos;ssuccessful rivals, and they are of sufficient importance to justify themost careful consideration. In most cases their application couldonly be gradual and would require at every stage the closest and mostcordial co-operation between the employers and operatives of lancashire.Possible Methods of Technical Improvement.(i) For the manufacture of cheap standard lines in which british goods have been so largely ousted from the eastern markets, extensiveuse has been made of the short-sitapled Indian cotton. This hashitherto been but little used in Lancashire, where the longer-stapledbut more expensive American cotton has been almost exclusivelypreferred. In this way her competitors, some of whom have acquiredgreat skill in the mixing of Indian and other cottons with american cotton, have secured an initial advantage over Lancashire by usinga cheaper cotton for their manufactures.(ii) Other countries use ring spindles to a much greater extent than Lancashire, and this method of spinning is of especialimportance where Indian and other short-stapled cotton is to be used.The use of siuch cotton might also require a ^adjustment) of thebalance between cardroom and spinning machinery. High draftspinning machinery and high-speed winding machinery have alsobeen found to offer the possibility of valuable economies.
(iii) In the manufacturing section the most important develop-ment abroad has been the introduction of automatic and semi-automatic looms for the weaving of standard cloths. These do not,as a rule, give a greater output per loom, but each weaver can minda very much larger number of looms than in the case of the ordinarypower loom as used in Lancashire. In this way, an important saving in wage costs is possible concurrently with an improvement in the remuneration of the individual weaver.(iv) The initial cost of automatic looms, and, to a less extent, of automatic attachments to ordinary looms, is high, and we receivedimportant evidence that automatic looms could not be workedeconomically on a single shift per day.Amalgamation.(v) The formation of larger units in the spinning and manufac-turing sections of the industry would serve three great purposes:(a) They would permit full advantage to be taken of any possibilitiesof technical improvement and would secure economies in production costs; (6) they would enable a common policy to be formulated and carried into effect within each of these sections; (c) they wouldprovide a firm basis for such a measure of co-ordination between those engaged in the various processes of production and marketing as willenable Lancashire once more to take the initiative in the markets ofthe world. These units should be strong enough to formulate adefinite production policy and to enter into arrangements with one another and with the other sections of the industry, including the merchants and the finishers, for a forward policy. The finishers arealready combined to a substantial extent, and the formation of strong and well-balanced amalgamations among the merchants also deservescareful consideration.(vi) Considerable sums of fresh capital may be required inconnection with amalgamations for such purposes as re-conditioningand re-equipping mills and for development. We are assured that, forany comprehensive and satisfactory rationalisation scheme having forits object the reduction of production costs and improved marketing,the necessary finance will be forthcoming.Development of Co-operative Effort throughout the Industry.(vii) Valuable service is being rendered to the cotton industry bythe Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations. The experi-ments that are being set on foot under the auspices of the Committeein co-operative production and systematic marketing of standard linesof goods should provide a practical testing ground of the possibilitiesof solving what we regard as the central problem of the industry.More generally, the Committee can do valuable work in variousdirections, in economic investigation and its co-ordination withteohnical research and in the practical application of both, in the interchange of ideas and information between the various sections ofthe industry, in organised propaganda and the finding of new usesfor cotton. The Joint Committee affords an opportunity for thedevelopment of a centre of information and study, a common mind, a concerted policy, for the industry as a whole.(viii) The changed conditions abroad, particularly in the far east, have vitally affected the position at home. We believe that advantage might accrue from an examination of these conditions onthe spot by the representatives of the British industry. In the eventof the industry deciding to send out a mission or missions for thispurpose, we recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should do all in their power to facilitate and assist their work.
