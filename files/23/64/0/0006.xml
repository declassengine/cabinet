ft?S.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed, the Cabinet that, owing to the great pressure on his time, the Prime Minister found itimpossible to become a member of the british delegation at the forthcoming Assembly of theLeague of Nations.    On his suggestion the cabinet agreed  That the British Delegation shouldbe composed as followsDELEGATES.The Secretary of State for foreign affairs the President of the Board of Trade(who would be able to attendfor a week) .Lord Cecil.Miss Susan Lawrence (for Healthquestions),ASSISTANT DELEGATES.Mr Dalton (Parliamentary Under-SecretaryForeign Office) .Mr Roden Buxton.Mrs Hamilton.Mr Noel Baker,
a . The Cabinet discussed at length thequestion of Unemployment Policy, both in its general and in its political aspects, arisingout of the recent resignation of the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster.,In the course of the discussion-,a number of suggestions were made for dealing with the questionof unemployment, among which may be mentioned theproposal to give Old Age Pensions at the age of 60*the raising of the school-leaving age;    extendedroad construction;    the formation of an emergencyCouncil of Ministers, meeting regularly several times a week;    a conference of Local Authoritiesin order to speed up their schemes;    the-takingby the Government of emergency powers to over-rideobstruction by Local Authorities and others when this was clearly contrary to the national interest;migration;    Government land purchase with a viewto establishing a landed peasantry;    and other forms of agricultural development, including asuggestion that the State should acquire a consider-able area of land with a view to its development onan intensive scale in order to establish definitelywhether Agriculture in this country could be madeprofitable.The Lord Privy Seal gave particulars of numerousprojects for relieving unemployment which, when onthe verge of acceptance by Local Authorities orother parties concerned, had ultimately been rejected or postponed,  in some cases as the resultof a ballot of rate-payers, in others owing to difficulties of local finance or for other reasonsbe;,, ond the control of the Government with its existing powers.   He gave particulars of a number
of projects, involving a large expenditure ofmoney, which, though approved by the Government,were temporarily held up pending parliamentary sanction.   He recalled, by reference to theCabinet rcoords,.how, before every public statement on Unemployment Policy, he had con-suited his colleagues as to the lines he shouldtake and had obtained their approval.    He remindedthem that he had, from the first,  counted on some assistance in solving the Unemployment problem from such dirsctions as Agriculture, the special measures for Distressed Areas, and Housing, andthat on unemployment grounds he had been a consistent advocate of a statement being made atan early stage in regard to the McKenna Duties.On,all these matters, however, he had loyallyaccepted the decisions of the Cabinet or of hiscolleagues more immediately concerned.    He had himself advocated putting his office as Ministerof Employment Into commission by associating with *him some of his colleagues who could give time tothis work.The Cabinet were informed that many of theproposals made in the course of the discussion,as well as the proposals contained in theMemorandum of the late Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, were actually under considerationby the Unemployment Policy Committee, over whichthe Prime Minister was presiding, but theirinquiry had been temporarily interrupted by thecircumstances attending the resignation of theChancellor of the Duchy o^ Lancaster.
Mr11JThe Cabinet agreed  (a) That, having regard to theimportance of avoiding theestablishment of a dangerous precedent, any demand for thepublication of the Memorandumby the late Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster on Unemploy-ment Policy (Paper CP .--31 (30))and the reply thereto (paper cp.--134 (30)) should be refused.The late Chancellor of the Duchy,of Lancaster would, no doubt,use his Memorandum, as the basis  !of his statements in Parlia-        Imentary Debate, and the reply.1 could be used by members of1   the Government in the same!   manner:(b) That the Prime Minister should,on the appropriate occasion,make a statement regarding theorganisation already in opera-tion for dealing with the ques-tion of Unemployment, includinghis own assumption of the Chairof the Unemployment PolicyCommittee.   He should also refer to the steps that had alreadybeen taken, or were under con-sideration, to speed up theexecution of the approvedmeasures for dealing with unemployment and for overcoming the obstacles to more rapid progress being made with those measures.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 22,  19 30.
