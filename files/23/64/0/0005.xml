soRUSSIA.Soviet Tro-paganda.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(30), Con-elusion 2(b).)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairacalled the attention of his colleagues to thelarge number of Questions which were beingaddressed to him in Parliament in regard toalleged propaganda activities directed against this country, whether by the Third Internationalor the Russian Soviet Government.   Up to now hehad replied to these Questions that the matter was receiving his serious consideration, and he proposed to continue this course for the moment.He inclined to the view that the evidence whichhad reached him on the subject ought to be carefully sifted, with a view to establishingwhether such propaganda was being carried out ornot.   He gave an account of a conversation he had had on the subject with the Russian soviet ambassador in London.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that, on receiving notice that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs intended to raise thisquestion, he had invited the Attorney-general to be present at the Cabinet, not for purposesof consultation, but in order that he might havean opportunity to listen to the discussion, sothat he could decide for himself, and within hisown jurisdiction, if any action on his part was desirable.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Committee, composed asfollows -The Lord Chancellor,The First Lord of the. Admiralty,The President of the Board ofEducation *-should meet to examine all theevidence in the hands of the
various Government departments in regard to the alleged propa-ganda activities of the ThirdInternational and/or the russian soviet Government:(b) That the Departmental information should be communicated to theCommittee by Officials designated by the Ministers concerned, unlessin any particular case the minister concerned should desire to supplyinformation personally:(c) That the Chairman tf the Committeeshould invite the attendance ofthe Ministers at the head of theDepartments concerned whenever he deemed that this was necessaryfor consultation or for discussionof particular questions:(d) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should not announce the setting up of a Cabinet Committee,but should be atithorised to statethat the Government had establishedappropriate machinery for enquiringinto any evidence that might arisebearing on the subject of Russianpropaganda, so as to ensure thatthey would be fully informed onthe question-    The Government would,of course, reach their decision in the usual manner.
THE GOAL 2. After hearing from the President of the mines BILL.Board of Trade a statement in regard to the(Previous amendments made by the House of Lords to the CoalReference:Cabinet 18 Mines Bill, the Cabinet agreed  (30), Con-clusion 5.) (a)  That, apart from one or two minor amendments which the President ofthe Board of Trade regarded as acceptable, all the amendmentsmade to the Bill by the Houseof Lords should be resisted:(b) That the House of Commons shouldbe asked to deal with the amend-ments in a single sitting, whichwould involve suspension of the11 o*clock Rule and a liberaluse of the Closure.
p. &apos;*THE LAND 3. The Lord Chancellor informed -the CabinetDRAINAGEBILL. 1930. - that the House of Lords had passed an amendmentpostponing the operation of the Land Drainage-Bill for five years.   Lord Phillimore hadintroduced an amendment the effect, of which wasto limit expenditure to the proceeds of a ^d.in the   rate.   A hint had been given that If;Lord Phillimore&apos;s amendment were accepted by theHouse of Commons the House of Lords might reducethe period before the Bill came into operation from five years to two years.After learning that Lord Phillimore&apos;s amend-ment would go far to nullify the objects of theBill,  and that the proposal to introduce a delay of two years before the Bill came into, operation was wholly unacceptable, for the reason that itwould in any event take two years to bring theBill into operation but a start could not be made until the Act was passed, the Cabinet agreed  That both amendments should berej ected.(previous reference:Cabinet 15(30)j Con-elusion 15.)
4.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (paper cp.-162 (30)) on the subject of the Anglo-RussianCommercial Treaty, in which he sought the guidanceof his colleagues as to whether it is desirableto initiate negotiations in respect of theCommercial Treaty at once or to postpone the submission of a draft until the Debt negotiations have made some progress or have at least beenbegun.   As regards the duration of the Treatyit was proposed in the Memorandum to follow the precedent of the Treaty of 1924, i.e.^ to provide that the Treaty should run for not less than threeyears and be subject to denunciation at any timethereafter, subject to 12 months1 notice.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in view of the existenceof a modus, vivendi with theSoviet Government on commercial relations, there was no need to expedite the conclusion of aCommercial Treaty:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to sign the temporaryAgreement which had been concluded in regard to fisheries.
