Secretary of State ^or InsLia todiscuss the draft Statement.    Atthis meeting it should be made clear to them that the intentionof His Majesty&apos;s Government isto make the Conference a reality,and that it was proposed to useany agreement that might be reached as the basis of a Bill to be intro-duced in Parliament.    Further, thatwhile,  as the principal means of ascertaining Indian opinion, theConference would take the placeof the original proposal thatIndian representatives should give evidence before a JointCommittee of both Houses,  thiswould not preclude Parliamentfrom dealing with the government bill by means of a Joint Committeeif such a procedure should commend itself.
