Mr Baldwin had suggesteddiscussion through the usual channels.   The primeMinister had acknowledged his letter and told mr. Baldwin that he would not be in a position to reply before Wednesday or Thursday.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the best&quot; plan would be to refer the question to the Joint Committeeof the three Parties which had met in 1928 to explore the question ofpolitical broad-casting:(b) That the Prime Minister should consult the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury onthe subject, and, unless he hadobjections to this course, should reply to Mr Baldwin as in (a) above.

The Prime Minister asked the Cabinet totake note of the recent evacuation of the Rhineland,and, with the unanimous consent of his colleagues.,took the opportunity to congratulate the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs on the completion ofa policy in the development of which he had takenso prominent a share.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Paris to informM, Briand that the Cabinet hadtaken appreciative note of the-evacuation of the Rhineland, butthat no formal message should bes ent .
rjijjB RUSSIAN 5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum5ebt  negotia-rpIONS . by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs! (previous (C.P.-232 (30)) reporting a difficulty whioh had reference:Cabinet 28 arisen in givins effect to certain provisions(30),  Con-clusion 4.) of the Anglo-Russian Protocol of the 3rd October,1929.    It had been arranged that a main Committeeshould be appointed, of five persons from each side, assisted by separate Sub-Committees dealingwith the following branches of the question:-(a) Nationalised properties.(b) Bonds and other securities.(c) Private debts, claims and counter-claims other than those covered by(a) and (b) .(d) Inter-governmental debts, claims and counter-claims .The British proposals provided that Sub-Committee(d) was to consist exclusively of members o^ theTreasury, and that the work of this Sub-Committeewas to be reported to the plenipotentiaries fortheir consideration, and to the main Committee fortheir information.   The main Committee ,would thus,with full knowledge of the conclusions reached in respect of inter-governmental debts, be in aposition to frame a complete scheme for thesettlement of the whole question involved.   TheSoviet Government., however, maintained that thisacheff*e would, in effect, amount to the constitutionof two Committees, one to deal with Governmentdebts and one to deal with private claims, and held that they ^ere not committed to such a ,procedure by the Protocol of the 3rd October,  1929.They insisted that the results of the work of sub-Committee &apos;d) should be reported to the main committee not only for information but also for
consideration.   They argued that if no conclusion was reached in the Sub-Committee it would be forthe main Committee to discuss the question of inter-governmental debts.    The negotiations had arrived at an impasse, and there appeared to be no chance of being able to set in motion the machineryfor the settlement of debts and claims.    In con-elusion, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs warned his colleagues that if the Soviet Governmentmaintain their position it will be impossible toproceed further to give effect to the enquiryrespecting debts and claims agreed upon in the protocol of the 3rd October, and the Governmentwould consequently be faced with the necessity of taking a very serious decision.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed --s   (a) To support the attitude hithertoadopted by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, in accordancewith the views of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, that the question ofGovernment debts could not bereferred for consideration to any committee including persons otherthan representatives of the Govern-ment:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorised,if he deemed necessary, to waive theinitialling of the arrangements inregard to Dub-Committee (d), onwhich, at the instance of theChancellor of the. Exchequer, he&apos;had hitherto insisted. (although.thiscourse.had not been taken in thecase of the other Sub-Gommittecs);on the clear understanding, however,that the procedure on which he had hitherto insisted should not be altered and that there should be nochange in this procedure withoutCabinet approval:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto announce in Parliament the names of the members of the main Committee.
THE DEAD SEA:Propos edArbitrat ionon Salts^Concession.6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Foreign Office,  circulated by directionof the Secretary o^ State for Foreign Axffairs(CP,-331 (30)), on the subject of a proposedarbitration on the Dead Sea Salts Concession.The request for the arbitration came from theFrench Government and met with the approval ofthe Foreign Office, but an unexpected difficulty had arisen as the Treasury insist that anycontingent financial liability arising out ofthe arbitration must fall on Palestinian and noton Imperial funds.   The Colonial Office and theForeign Office oppose this view, on the groundthat, the proposal to accept arbitration being based essentially on Imperial grounds of policy,any contingent liability should fall on the diplomatic and Consular Vote.    It was urged as important that a reply should be returned to theFrench Government without further delay.The Cabinet took note that the Legal advisers to the Departments concerned were unanimous thatthere was very little prospect of our losing thisarbitration.    Consequently the financial liabilityshould be limited to ?.1,000, which the Secretaryof State for the Colonies agreed was not beyondthe capacity of Palestine to pay, although itmight have to be obtained,.in practice,  from agrant-in-aid.   The Cabinet agreed That if&quot; the arbitration should be lost,.His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould have to take up the matter with the Palestine Governmentwith a view to securing as large a contribution as possible andto obtaining as full an indemnifica-tion as possible from the concession-air es o^ the Dead Sea Salts underthe terms of the covenant to this effect included in their Concession.
7.    At the request of the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Cabinet were informed as to the steps which had been taken as the result of theReport of the Sub-Gommittee of the economic advisory Council on the Iran and Steel Industry.The Prime Minister, accompanied by some of hiscolleagues and officials, had had an interviewon June 24th with representatives of the Iron andSteel Industry, both manufacturers and workers,as well as of the Bankers&apos; Development Company,as the result of which the Prime Minister had invited the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, in consultation with those interested, toprepare a concrete scheme for consideration bythe Government,   While Safeguarding had been mentioned by one of the manufacturers at the endof the meeting, the intention had been that thescheme to be prepared for consideration by theGovernment should relate mainly to the question ofamalgamations and rationalisation.   The next stephad been discussions between certain government officials (Sir Horace Wilson and Mr Ashley) andthe representatives of the industry.   The officials had been instructed to have nothing to do with anyschemes for Safeguarding, and had acted on these instructions .   They now reported that aftervarious schemes of re-organisation alreadyaccomplished and now taking place had beenreported on, a question had arisen as to how thecapital was to be obtained, and in this connection the question of Safeguarding had been raised bythe non-Official representatives.   Moreover, oneOrf the Labour representatives had recalled a
*) p 060 6warning he had given at a meeting in Paris to theeffect that if wage-cutting was continued on theContinent, employes in this country would haveto consider the position.   The Government Officials/had been careful to avoid taking part in discus-sions on, this subject and had made their positionperfectly clear to the members of the Sub-Committee..This position was re-affirmedby the Cabinet.
^EMPLOYMENT?OHCY.fixe Attitudeof the Govern-fnfent towardsIndustrialReorganisation,(previous reference:Cabinet 35(SO), Con-elusion 8.)8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(C.P.-227 (30)), who, in his former office as lord Privy Seal, had, with the approval of theCabinet, devoted close attentipn to industrial re-organisation.    In this Memorandum, after reviewing the work he had put in hand, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs urged that the work should continue and should now be entrusted tothe President of the Board of Trade, who could make use of the staff that had hitherto assistedthe late Lord Privy Seal.The discussion on the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sMemorandum extended over many aspects of thequestion of Unemployment, including such matters as the two-shift system;    the extent to which theGovernment should themselves promote rationalisation-tion;    the extent to which, by doing so, theyrendered the country liable to provide relief for persons thrown out of employment owing to ration-alisation;    the general  question of how the victims of rationalisation should be provided for, whetherby special measures or by the ordinary machinery;the large problem of the displacement of man-power by machinery and. its effect on employment;    and various aspects of the fiscal controversy.With a view to the formulation of a policy for consideration by the Cabinet, the cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster should be invited to make an immediate and intensive study ofthe question of what is wrong isithBritish industry and^hat stepsought to be taken to provide a remedy.    For this purpose he shouldbe given access to material at the
disposal of the Cabinet and theEconomic Advisory Council, andshould place himself in contact with the President of the Board   -of Trade, the Minister of Labour,and any Ministers who had a specialpoint of view.    One of the membersof the Secretariat of the economic advisory Council should be placed at his disposal for the collectionof material, and so forth.-11-
NATIONAL HEALTH 9. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by insurance.. - the Minister of Health (CP.-225 (30)) circulatingI  paternity and specialist a copy of a Paper&quot;v-hich he had communicated to services .the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the subject of(previous the restoration of the State contribution to reference:Cabinet 34        National Health Insurance to the figure at which(29),  Con-conclusion 5.)       it stood before the passing of -the Economy Act,1926.   The Minister of Health, in his covering memorandum, recalled that there was a very strong feeling among the G- over nm ent&apos; s supporters, andespecially among women, in favour of improvedprovision for maternity.   The Chancellor of theExchequer, however, had informed him that in his judgment the financial situation, present and prospective, was such that proposals of this kindmust be deferred.    In these circumstances theMinister of Health asked that, if the Cabinetendorses the Chancellor of the Exchequers view,he should have full authority to state that an improved maternity scheese and the restoration ofthe State contribution.bu.tion are things which.will haveto be postponed on the ground of the general financial position.With a view to a further discussion on thesubject, the Cabinet invited the Minister of health to furnish as full information as possible inregard to the incidence of mortality in maternitycases;    e.g., according to districts;    accordingto the class of the population;    in cases treated by doctors or midwives respectively&apos;    in institu-tions;    according to age;    and any other particularsthat might be valuable to the Cabinet in consideringthe question, which was recognised as one ofconsiderable public interest.
THE west indies.The PoliticalAspect of the sugar Question,(previous reference:Cabinet 11(30), Con-clusion 5.)19-. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies(C.P.-221 (30)) covering a copy of a Despatch inwhich the Governor of Barbados describes therecent visit of the United States Squadron tothe Island.   Attention was drawn particularly tocertain remarks of the Governor which illustrate the political aspect of the difficulties due tothe sugar position.   Among these remarks was thefollowing:-&quot;I have no doubt that the sentimentof attachment to the Mother Countryis no less strong in the other old-established English Colonies in the carribbean than it is in Barbados,but amongst thinking men in all ofthem there seems to be often presentthe dread that this sentiment willnot by itself, nor unless it receivespractical support, be strong enoughto maintain what all desire, viz.,the predominance of Great britain in West Indian trade&quot;.The Cabinet invited the Secretary-y of Statefor Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to confer as to the possibilityof any further development of Canadian interest in and connection with the West Indies.

When the cost of&apos; livinghad fallen from 70 per cent, to 65 per cent,pre-war, he had not insisted on a reduction.The cost of living had now fallen from 65 percent, to considerably lower than 60 per cent.,and in the ciroumstances he considered some reduction of wages and salaries must be made.The Cabinet agreed  -To support the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in the attitudehe proposed to adopt.-15-

A P .P E H P I X.Cypher telegram to Sir P * Loraine (Cairo).Foreign Office, 9th July, 1930, 2.30 p.m.No. 228.tr* *f* *a* &apos;*** *-* -** *** *i *&quot;* *rf *W *K ** &quot;t 1-&quot;    **R **Your telegram Nos. 306-308 (of July 8th? politicalsituation)I have greatly appreciated the clear and unbiased picture of the situation which you have presented in successivetelegrams.    In view of the serious developments yesterday itis my earnest hope that mediation will become possible inthe near future and in any case before violation of the Consti-tution has taken place by alteration of the electoral law.To this His iv;majesty.sty&apos;s Government could be no party in view ofthe attitude taken up by them last Autumn and announced inParliament in December, end though precluded from intervention by 1922 undertaking, they would be unable to conceal theirdisapproval of a step so contrary to the principles for whichthey stand.While therefore, I should be willing lor vou to speak to-Sidky as proposed in paragraphs A, B, C end P of yourtelegram No. 306, I feel that were you to address enquiry tohim on lines of first paragraph of that telegram, it would beconstrued by him as a tacit encouragement &quot;to violate Gonstitur.-tion, a course to which for reasons  have stated His Majesty:-sGovernment could not ba party.I have noted with relief Sidky s statement (your telegramNo. 306) that he is not a King*s man, for policy of neutralityalready difficult enough, would become impossible were heto become the mere puppet of the King, of whose true aims andambitions he must be as well aware as we are.
Opportunity for making public statement of our attitude will almost certainly occur in near future in reply to parliamentary question, but I do not proposeto say anything until I have received your observations on this telegram.
