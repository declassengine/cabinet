APPENDIX.STATEMENT OH AGRICULTURAL POLICY.(A.s approved by the Cabinet on July31st, 1930TT1. In view of the depression which exists In certain branches of the agricultural industry, and the urgent need for reform in methods both of marketing and productionin order to take advantage of our valuable home market, theGovernment have given anxious consideration to. theagricultural problem, with especial regard to the desirabilityof increasing employment on the land with good standards ofliving, recognising that this can only be assured throughprosperity in the industry-.2. Holdings for small Cultivators.Proposals will be submitted for making land more freelyavailable for small cultivators and affording them adequatesecurity of tenure.Local Authorities will be stimulated to meet the large and unsatisfied demand for small holdings, cottage holdings and allotments.     In addition, the Minister of Agriculturewill be given powers to acquire and manage land for these purposes, so as to supplement but in. no way to , supplantLocal Authorities that are active.     Powers to provide cottageholdings will be extended to Counts&apos; Borough Councils and theseholdings will be made available for letting as well as sale and for a wider class of applicant.Unemployment Scheme.A scheme will be undertaken whereby a contribution maybe made to the mitigation of unemployment by the creation ofa special class of allotments and of market garden and poultryholdings up to 5 acres for suitable unemployed workors.
- ii.3 * Lar^e-Scale Barmine; and Demon strati on Farms.An Agricultural Land Utilisation Corporation will beestablished to conduct, on the one hand, large-scale farming,managed on business principles, with the utmost possibleapplication of improved methods and the beet machinery, withthe particular object of affording to agriculturists a practicaltraining in business management; and on the other hand,additional Demonstration Farms of various types in differentparto of the country, designed to secure the quicker and more general adoption of every agricultural improvement.4. Scotland.In Scotland, the Department of Agriculture will make everyeffort to Increase the number of small holdings available-    Atthe same time investigations toil! be set on foot for improvingcertain large tracts of barren and moss land and for reclama-tion works.    Arrangements arc   under consideration for theextension of the Agricultural Credits Act, 1928, to Scotland.5. Cereals.Tho critical position of cereal farmers demands theearliest possible attention.     The questionjjf tho conditionof this class of agriculturists in different parts of theEmpire will bo discussed at the forthcoming Imperial conference with special reference to Bulk Purchase, import boards and Stabilisation of Prices.     In view cf this, and of thepossibility that the 4e^Gi-s-no of the Conference on thismatter may   materially change the practical problem ofdealing with cereal farming, the Government is not in aposition at present to formulate comprehensive proposalsfor this part of the agricultural situation beyond the plansoutlined in this statement for improved methods of cultivation,the better organisation and marketing of produce, education
and research, and improved credit facilities.     But assoon as the accioios-o of the Imperial Conxcrence are known, the Government will undertake whatever practicable steps can be devised to put cereal growing in this country on an economic foundation.Agricultural Marketing Bill.It is an urgent necessity to give our home producersopportunities of orderly and better marketing in our industrial market.A Bill is being introduced forthwith for purposes of criticism and comment, which offers certain powers to large-scale commodity organisations initiated by producersthemselves for the marketing of home-produced agricultural products and protects such organisations from the disruptiveaction of minorities.     There are precedents for legislation of a cimilar kind in overseas parts of the Empire.The Bill contemplates organisations of two distincttypes, though combinations of both are possible.     First,there is the older and better-known pool type which is welladapted for products in respect of which we are largelyself-supporting, and of which the market may be disturbed by recurring surpluses-     The Bill also provides fororganisations of the regulatory type which are concernedmore with the craft of marketing than with the physicalcontrol and handling of the product, and which, after themanner of a board of directors, would formulate a coherentmarketing policy for the hone product and carry it intoeffect.Financial assistance by way of both long and shortterm loans will be available for these commodity marketing boards.(ill)
Care has been taken to provide safeguards for thegreat body of consumers and for other affected interests.7. Abattoirs.The erection of publicly-ovtned abattoirs by LocalAuthorities for the centralised slaughtering of livestockwill be encouraged.Part III.8. Education and Rjsaearch.The development of agricultural education will alsoform an important part of our policy.    An agricultural research Council is being constituted to secure improvedco-ordination and extension of agricultural researchthroughout the United Kingdom.     In view of the greatlosses incurred through disease, among the first subjects to receive attention will be contagious abortion,tuberculosis, and swine fever.9. Scrub gulls.Legislation will be introduced to regulate the use and import of bulls, with a view to improving the standard ofour livestock.Part.IV.10* The Agricultural Worker.Apart from the increased provision for access to landfor their own cultivation that the policy affords to suitable workers, it is important that agricultural workers should share in any added prosperity which may accrue to theindustry, and the working of the existing machinery for regulating wages will be carefully watched with this object in view.
(y)11. Housing. ; &apos; &quot;The present Housing Bill contains provisions whichshould mitigate the evil of the tied cottag^iy to which vie- attach great importance, and it is the intention of theGovernment to take speoiul steps to stimulate the provisionof   improved housing in rural areas under the powerstherein provided.Further, a Committee which is to-be appointed toconsider the Pvcnt Restriction -Act, will aed&amp;J&amp;ssytJNr special position of the &quot;tied cottage&quot;, with a view to providing a remedy against any unfair use of this system.12. Conclusion.,     -   The Government is convinced that by a sustained and welldirected.effort designed to evoke the co-operation of theindustry itself it should bo possible to arrest the decline of.-employment on the land and to.fester, by taking advantageof modern developments and facilities, specialised and improved methods of production which should result in agreat increase in our home-^pro&amp;uccd food supplies and bring :back prosperity to our countryside.     We believe that our proposals will have the effect of inspiring In all sectionsof the farming conmunitjr that confidence which is soessential to its progress and welfare, and will promote the sound development of our great agricultural Industry.
